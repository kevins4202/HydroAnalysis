5535,river monitoring is a critical issue for hydrological modelling that strongly relies on the use of flow rating curves frcs in most of the cases frcs are approximated by least squares fitting whose performance may be influenced by measurements variability which is often limited in high values in this context a new formulation has been recently introduced to exploit available knowledge on cross sectional geometry for a more robust derivation of frcs this method combines the wetted area stage and the cross sectionally averaged velocity stage functions in the frcs derivation limiting at least partially the uncertainty in the extrapolation of higher discharge values the methodology is tested on four gauged cross sections of the tiber river basin where a relatively high number of measurements are available this dataset is used to test the reliability of the new approach with respect to the classic method in relatively stable river cross sections a jackknifing approach is used to understand the role played by the number of gaugings and range of observations on the applicability of the new formulation highlighting its advantages in data scarce environments in particular we observed that the new approach becomes advantageous when the observations are limited both in terms of the range of observations or in terms of sample size i e 10 samples keywords flow rating curves frcs environmental monitoring streamflow discharge data scarce regions 1 introduction the operational measurement of discharge in medium and large rivers is mostly based on indirect approaches that rely on the use of the stage streamflow relationship called flow rating curves frcs chow 1959 fenton and keller 2001 kumar 2011 the frcs are calibrated to gaugings which are synchronized observations of water level and discharge measurements obtained during specific field campaigns wmo 2010 discharge measurements are generally obtained with traditional current meters that are easy to use have good precision especially if the watercourse is not too deep or in flood and may be repeated over time with limited effort nevertheless the presence of turbulence and high flow velocities may limit the use of such techniques or strongly reduce accuracy tazioli 2011 moramarco et al 2004 more recently these systems have been replaced by surface velocimetry radar technology e g moramarco et al 2019 new flowtracker acoustic doppler velocimeters or optical cameras coupled with image velocimetry techniques that may help to improve the quality of streamflow measurements manfreda et al 2018 rehmel 2007 tauro et al 2018 yorke and oberg 2002 despite the advancements in technology and the introduction of new methods for streamflow monitoring errors and uncertainty still persist in historical hydrological records gaugings reliability is influenced by several factors that prevent us from the use of a satisfying number of observations covering the entire range of variability of the discharge this may be due to the difficulty to carry out field observation during high stage events not necessarily extreme floods dal sasso et al 2018 the morphological changes induced by erosion or sedimentation bertoldi et al 2010 vanacker et al 2005 and the presence of vegetation may also produce seasonal annual changes in river roughness cotton et al 2006 hickin 1984 it must also be underlined that frcs are generally estimated assuming steady state conditions and neglecting the hysteresis observed in water level and streamflow relationship during flood events e g dottori et al 2009 fread 1975 therefore the time instant at which streamflow is observed during the rising or falling limb may significantly affect the regression function and its extrapolation at the higher values the effect of unsteadiness on the flow discharge can be corrected considering the water surface slope explicitly using stage measurements in two reference sections but this requires that two gauging stations are located at close distance one from the other in order to appreciate the slope of the surface without influences of lateral flow e g fenton and keller 2001 additional factors including cost time feasibility to access and safety restrict the sample size and the range of variability of streamflow measurements given these constraints the frcs obtained by curve fitting methods may be associated with good performance indices but do not necessarily provide good results given the limited number of points used for calibration therefore the common practice to derive high flow values by extrapolation may produce a significant amount of uncertainty on flood statistics and predictions yen 1994 petersen øverleir 2004 braca 2008 in this context the role of the hydrographer in river monitoring and reconstruction of the frc is crucial for discharge quantification water resources management and flood studies hydrographers should take into account the physical characteristics of a river gauge station the morphological evolution of the river and the cross section the presence of vegetation and its evolution over time the presence of hydraulic controls the accumulation of deposits and the eventual cleaning of the channel hamilton et al 2019 all this information should be associated with the gaugings in order to derive robust frcs that should take into consideration the hydraulic characteristics of the cross section unfortunately streamflow measurements are discontinuous in time and in most of the cases do not contain information about the hydrograph phases rising or falling limb this implies that time consuming and expensive field campaigns e g detert et al 2017 do not always provide an adequate dataset for the derivation of frcs it is frequent to deal with flow measurements limited in accuracy range of variability and total number for frcs reconstruction a new simplified methodology introduced by manfreda 2018 referred to as the flow area model is here tested in order to explore its relative advantage respect to the classical frcs therefore this manuscript addresses the reliability of frcs relationship in scarce data environments focusing in particular on i chosen model ii the number of measurements considered sample size and iii range on which those measurements stand two models namely the classical model and the flow area model for the derivation of frcs are explored and tested by using as case study field data collected at four different gauged river cross sections in central italy 2 methodology two approaches for estimation of the frc frcs are generally obtained using curve fitting methods with river stage h and discharge q observations the most common equation used to describe the relationship between h and q is clarke 1999 lambie 1978 mosley and mckerchar 1993 1 q α h h 0 β where α β and h 0 are calibration parameters equation 1 referred to as the classical model or model 1 in the next parts of the paper is fitted to the n observations of h i q i neglecting the monitoring procedure used to derive q in fact a standard method of stream flows monitoring is to regularly measure the averaged flow velocity v generally with few distributed point measurements and to evaluate the associated wetted area of the cross section ω exploiting both data sets and using the definition of the averaged flow velocity as v q ω manfreda 2018 proposed that frcs can be obtained as the product of these two regression functions 2 q v ω where v and ω describe the relationship between the mean flow velocity and the wetted area as a function of the river stage h h 0 these functions can be fitted using available observations and cross section surveys equation 2 is referred to as the flow area model or model 2 the flow area model consists of calibrating the aforementioned functions separately and the estimate of discharge is therefore given by their multiplication the great advantage of expressing the river discharge in terms of these two decoupled factors is that the geometrical relationship can also be obtained from topographic surveys the recent advancements in topographic surveys with modern portable gps laser scanners and photogrammetry can be useful in this regard in this context the structure from motion sfm technique can offer a low cost and timely option langhammer et al 2017 manfreda et al 2019 3 streamflow observations in the tiber river basin both methods are tested on four cross sections selected in the tiber river basin central italy that have been studied and monitored for several years moreover these case studies are well documented in a number of previous studies focusing on flow propagation and monitoring e g moramarco and dingman 2017 barbetta et al 2013 perumal et al 2010 a description of the considered hydrometric sites is given in fig 1 three of them are located on the tiber river i e santa lucia ponte felcino and ponte nuovo sites while the ponte rosciano gauged section is located on the chiascio river the main left tributary of tiber river in the upper part of the basin morphological characteristics of the sites selected are similar and can be classified in terms of channel type as foreseen in the classification by rinaldi et al 2013 2015 specifically all the investigated gauged sections are placed in a meandering single thread river with a sinuosity value defined as the ratio of stream length to valley length between 1 4 and 1 8 fig 2 shows the evolution of the cross section s geometry surveyed during different field campaigns as can be seen the shape of the sections is found quite symmetrical but not perfectly this condition is in accordance with the classification in terms of morphological characteristics of the four test sites considering that a symmetrical channel is typical of straight channel while an asymmetrical one is typically observed along meandering rivers it is found that ponte nuovo santa lucia ponte felcino and ponte rosciano sites are characterized by a channel slope equal to 0 0014 0 002 0 0015 0 002 respectively the comparison between different topographical surveys also indicates that the river cross sections did not evolve maintaining a relatively stable geometry over the considered time window the main characteristics of the selected river sections are summarized in table 1 santa lucia drains an area of 935 km2 and has a mean annual discharge of about 13 m3 s during the period 1987 2008 a total number of 34 flow measurements has been carried out in the range 0 72 239 35 m3 s the drainage area related to ponte felcino section is about 2035 km2 and the mean annual discharge 19 m3 s a sample of 46 discharge measurements is available for the analysis ponte rosciano is located on the chiascio river few kilometres upstream the confluence with the tiber river the drainage basin has an area of 1956 km2 and a sample of 44 flow measurements can be considered for the study the ponte nuovo section is located on the main river just downstream the confluence with the chiascio river and drains an area of 4145 km2 the largest measurements sample is available for this site see table 1 where the highest mean annual discharge is observed flow measurements at the four selected gage sites are carried out by current meter from cableway the discharge is assessed by applying the well known velocity area method at velocity profiles sampled in the cross sectional flow area herschy 1985 the velocity measurements for river flow estimation were carried out during flood events when they occurred and the conditions made the execution of operations by technicians safe for these reasons some of the available measurements were developed during floods rising limb and or recession limb period i e the highest ones while some others were executed with low medium flow condition because of the necessity to provide new data for the rating curve update at all the four gauged sections the maximum discharge was observed during the severe flood event that affected the tiber river basin on 25 november 2005 specifically a peak flow equal to about 400 880 1100 and 570 m3 s was recorded at santa lucia ponte felcino ponte nuovo and ponte rosciano section respectively the return period of this maximum discharge was quantified to be about 60 years for santa lucia and ponte nuovo sections 45 years for ponte felcino site and 40 years for ponte rosciano gauge fig 3 shows the scatter plots of the discharge measurements with the discharge q as a function of the river stage h and in the inset the description of the average flow velocity v and wetted cross section area ω as a function of the water level stage for the four investigated cross sections all data display a clear dependence from the water level stage but it can be noticed also a slight increase in the gaugings variability when moving to higher values for sake of clarity discharge measurements are reported in appendix a even if the plots are given in linear scale a preliminary check on a log log scale of the data have been carried out this highlighted a change in the slope of the discharge stage relationship in the log log scale for low flow values in fact low flow values are generally affected by local control but fortunately this limitation is washed out for higher flows fenton and keller 2001 therefore the fitting exercise described in the following sections has been carried out on a subset of the measurements sample that excludes low flow values 4 results comparison of the two models based on the available dataset the two models are compared following the methodology described here below the available dataset are used to generate random subsamples of given size and range in order to test the models performances in both calibration and validation where this last is carried out using the data excluded by the subsampling this approach can be iterated over several random combinations of samples exploring the performances of the two models under specific conditions the classical model model 1 described in eq 1 is fitted using the q h relationship by considering the streamflow discharge and the stage observed during the measurements while the flow area model model 2 is fitted on the two variables whose product leads to the discharge i e the flow velocity and the flow area this implies that errors in the fitting of the two functions v h or ω h may be amplified by the product leading to larger errors based on empirical evidence the following relationships are considered for the present case study 3 v λ ln h h 0 ξ 4 ω γ h h 0 δ where λ ξ γ δ and h0 are fitting coefficients it is worthy of underlining that the regression function for the mean flow velocity has been selected observing the specific behaviour of the measurements of the tiber river the trend of the mean flow velocity was a power law with exponent close to one almost a linear function in previous analysis carried out on smaller rivers manfreda 2018 but a logarithmic behaviour was found to be the best regression function for the present dataset such behaviour can be clearly recognized in the inset of fig 3 2000 subsets for each sample size of the original dataset are used to derive the frcs with both methods using a sample size ranging from five measurements up to the maximum length of the population minus five with five elements left for validation purposes in addition we also explore the role of the range of variability of the observations adopting a different strategy to extract our subset of samples limiting the range of observation to a given threshold of empirical non exceedance probability of the water level stages the threshold selected range between 0 5 and 0 9 it must be clarified that eq 4 is calibrated only once using all available observations of the cross section because it assumed that the cross section is stable over time and that these measurements can be always expanded using the topographic surveys this may represent an advantage for the structure of the frc given the fact that the cross section area varies non linearly with the river stage impacting significantly on the reliability of the method used 4 1 the impact of sample size models performances are quantitatively measured in terms of root mean square error rmse both in the calibration and validation phases the large number of subsamples generated allowed to explore the model performances under different conditions a preliminary result of the analyses is given in fig 4 that provides a comparison of the rmse of the two models in calibration a and validation b using different subsamples of different sizes of the measurements taken at ponte nuovo the graph provides a comparison of the rmse obtained with the two methods the comparison between the two models can be quantitatively interpreted using the 1 1 line the solid blue line in the plot that divides the area into two portions identifying where model 2 is underperforming upper left and where it is outperforming lower right in addition each point of the scatter plot is associated with a colour that represents the sample size adopted as expected the performances of the two models tend to deteriorate with the reduction of the sample size in fact the errors tend to increase for both methods as the number of samples decrease the classical model seems to be more robust when the number of observations increases while model 2 is outperforming model 1 in validation when the number of gaugings is limited it is interesting to note that the pattern of points is significantly different in the figures of calibration and validation results of calibrations are all in favour of model 1 that produces on the average lower rmse the situation changes significantly in validation where most of the points referring to low sample sizes points coloured in blue are in the lower right portion of the graph in this panel a cluster of points coloured in yellow larger sample size can be observed on the 1 1 line in the lower left corner of the graph this cluster is slightly shifted on the upward suggesting that both models become more robust with the increase of the number of samples but the classical model model 1 is preferable to characterize the frc on the other hand model 2 may help in interpreting frcs in data scarce environments for this reason it is interesting to further investigate when the flow area model should and can be applied to enhance the reliability of frcs the different performance of the two models is better emphasized in the graphs of fig 5 where the relative difference between the rmse of model 2 and 1 is plotted as a function of the sample size adopted in calibration the graphs show all the combinations explored using the available data in the four stations considered herein it can be noticed that there is a higher concentration of negative values negative values identify cases where model 2 is outperforming model 1 in the graphs on the right column validation respect to the ones on the left calibration in fact it can be stated that the classical model is generally better for fitting the discharge data while the advantages of the second approach can be appreciated during the validation phase this is due to the fact that the proposed model allows reaching a more robust description of the frcs even if it provides higher rmse in calibration see left column panels the orange line in the graph represents the mean values of such a difference as a function of the sample size adopted for the fitting this function may help in identifying the number of samples necessary to use the classical model model 1 or the proposed flow area model model 2 in particular we observed that the flow area model can be on average more convenient when the number of streamflow measurements is below 9 10 there is only one exception that is represented by the station of ponte felcino where flow area model provides better results over the entire range investigated up to a sample size of 30 increased robustness of the modelling approach should also lead to a reduction in the uncertainty of the resulting frcs uncertainty may be due to random errors in the measurements or epistemic errors due to temporal changes in the hydraulic conditions mcmillan and westerberg 2015 in the present case we assume that uncertainty is only related to random errors given the relative stability of the cross section over the considered period or instrumental errors therefore using the ensemble of 2000 frcs derived from different combinations of subsamples with assigned size it is possible to derive the mean discharge value and its confidence interval at 95 in function of the flow depth for a given sample size these results are reported in the graphs fig 6 for the ponte nuovo station fig 7 for the santa lucia station fig 8 for the ponte felcino station and fig 9 for the ponte rosciano station it can be observed that the use of the flow area model leads to a significant reduction of the uncertainty in the frcs especially during the extrapolation phase at the higher values of stage and discharge the differences between the two models tend to be smoothed out with the increase of the number of samples adopted but it is interesting to note that there is a significant reduction of the confidence bands with the use of the flow area model for all cases where the sample size is relatively small in order to provide a quantitative description of the fitting exercise with the two proposed model we have included in appendix b the mean value of the model parameters and their range of variability in the different configurations explored in terms of samples size it can be noticed that the range of variability of the model parameters reflects clearly the results discussed above 4 2 the impact of the range of variability of observations another limitation for the use of frcs is represented by the range of observations that are generally limited to the lower discharge values in fact the upper part of the frcs is the less explored and also the most critical for operational purposes therefore the second experiment is aimed at exploring the impact of the range of observations limiting our subsample to the discharge values with a non exceedance probability lower than a certain threshold set between 0 5 and 0 9 using this approach it is possible to derive frcs using only a subset of gaugings extracted from the lower values of discharge and validate the results on the remaining values including those exceeding the selected threshold results of this experiment are reported in the following graphs fig 10 which provide only the mean value of the relative difference of the rmse of the two methods as a function of the sample size and for the different thresholds investigated herein the results clearly show that the flow area model is useful especially when we deal with a limited range of observations in fact it is confirmed that the classical model performs better in calibration but the flow area model performs definitely much better in validation therefore the use of the cross section as a physical constraint for the derivation of the fitting function becomes more effective for the estimation of the discharge values outside the range of observation used for calibration higher discharges similarly to the previous section frcs and their respective confidence intervals have been derived in order to provide a visual description of the impact of the model choice on the frc in order to simplify the number of potential plots we selected one sample size and one non exceedance probability threshold to remove higher values from the training subsamples given the evidence of the previous section the sample size of n 10 was chosen in order to explore a condition where the two methods provided similar results in terms of rmse while the p h h 0 8 was chosen in order to remove only floods from the dataset consequently following the same procedure described in the previous section the mean frc and its confidence interval at 95 has been derived for a fixed sample size and a given threshold applied to remove higher discharge values from the subsample the frcs obtained are reported in fig 11 for each considered gauging stations it is observed a clear trend in reducing the uncertainty in the frcs when the flow area model is used this implies that the flow area model may reduce the uncertainty in the derivation of discharge values extrapolated from the frcs 5 conclusion the proposed procedure breaks down the estimation of frcs using flow velocity and wetted cross section functions in fact the cross section flow area ω can be derived directly from topographic surveys while the study of averaged flow velocities can be related to the river stage and used to derive the flow area rating curve this method represents a suitable alternative for the derivation of frcs allowing exploitation of the available information about the characteristics of river cross section geometry the comparison between the two models has been carried out on four gauged river sections selected in the upper tiber river basin where a fairly large number of streamflow measurements are available in particular the comparison is performed using different subsamples of river flow observations for calibration and validation the subsample size ranges from 5 up to 50 depending on the analysed gauging station and therefore on the number of available flow measurements in most of the calibration cases model 1 has slightly lower rmse values than the flow area model however model 2 displays some advantages in validation but the number of observations influences its performance in particular we observed a reduction of the differences of rmse values by increasing the number of samples showing a trend that both models converge with a large number of data and the classical model can be better if the sample size and the range of observation are adequately explored in turn flow area model seems to be more robust in data scarce environments where frcs can benefit from the use of the cross section flow area function in their derivation the analyses allowed to understand that the flow area proposed formulation may be extremely beneficial in data scarce environments and in all cases where the range of observation is limited in particular the flow area model should be adopted when less than 10 observations are available while the classical approach should be used when more measurements can be used for frc estimate on the other hand adopting the flow are model produced an improvement of results when the site is characterized by a limited range of observations typically only low medium range values are measured in this case the relative differences between the two models are even more emphasized showing significant improvements of the flow area model in validation over all the range of investigated subsample sizes given these promising results on this set of data the applicability of the flow area model should be further explored considering different river morphologies and also different flow regimes it must be stated that this approach does not overcome the problem of alluvial rivers where the river cross section may change significantly especially during floods but it represents a viable alternative in more stable rivers in such cases this simple methodology improves the physical consistency of frcs and it has great potential for application in data scarce environments author contributions all authors equally contributed to the manuscript declaration of competing interest the

5535,river monitoring is a critical issue for hydrological modelling that strongly relies on the use of flow rating curves frcs in most of the cases frcs are approximated by least squares fitting whose performance may be influenced by measurements variability which is often limited in high values in this context a new formulation has been recently introduced to exploit available knowledge on cross sectional geometry for a more robust derivation of frcs this method combines the wetted area stage and the cross sectionally averaged velocity stage functions in the frcs derivation limiting at least partially the uncertainty in the extrapolation of higher discharge values the methodology is tested on four gauged cross sections of the tiber river basin where a relatively high number of measurements are available this dataset is used to test the reliability of the new approach with respect to the classic method in relatively stable river cross sections a jackknifing approach is used to understand the role played by the number of gaugings and range of observations on the applicability of the new formulation highlighting its advantages in data scarce environments in particular we observed that the new approach becomes advantageous when the observations are limited both in terms of the range of observations or in terms of sample size i e 10 samples keywords flow rating curves frcs environmental monitoring streamflow discharge data scarce regions 1 introduction the operational measurement of discharge in medium and large rivers is mostly based on indirect approaches that rely on the use of the stage streamflow relationship called flow rating curves frcs chow 1959 fenton and keller 2001 kumar 2011 the frcs are calibrated to gaugings which are synchronized observations of water level and discharge measurements obtained during specific field campaigns wmo 2010 discharge measurements are generally obtained with traditional current meters that are easy to use have good precision especially if the watercourse is not too deep or in flood and may be repeated over time with limited effort nevertheless the presence of turbulence and high flow velocities may limit the use of such techniques or strongly reduce accuracy tazioli 2011 moramarco et al 2004 more recently these systems have been replaced by surface velocimetry radar technology e g moramarco et al 2019 new flowtracker acoustic doppler velocimeters or optical cameras coupled with image velocimetry techniques that may help to improve the quality of streamflow measurements manfreda et al 2018 rehmel 2007 tauro et al 2018 yorke and oberg 2002 despite the advancements in technology and the introduction of new methods for streamflow monitoring errors and uncertainty still persist in historical hydrological records gaugings reliability is influenced by several factors that prevent us from the use of a satisfying number of observations covering the entire range of variability of the discharge this may be due to the difficulty to carry out field observation during high stage events not necessarily extreme floods dal sasso et al 2018 the morphological changes induced by erosion or sedimentation bertoldi et al 2010 vanacker et al 2005 and the presence of vegetation may also produce seasonal annual changes in river roughness cotton et al 2006 hickin 1984 it must also be underlined that frcs are generally estimated assuming steady state conditions and neglecting the hysteresis observed in water level and streamflow relationship during flood events e g dottori et al 2009 fread 1975 therefore the time instant at which streamflow is observed during the rising or falling limb may significantly affect the regression function and its extrapolation at the higher values the effect of unsteadiness on the flow discharge can be corrected considering the water surface slope explicitly using stage measurements in two reference sections but this requires that two gauging stations are located at close distance one from the other in order to appreciate the slope of the surface without influences of lateral flow e g fenton and keller 2001 additional factors including cost time feasibility to access and safety restrict the sample size and the range of variability of streamflow measurements given these constraints the frcs obtained by curve fitting methods may be associated with good performance indices but do not necessarily provide good results given the limited number of points used for calibration therefore the common practice to derive high flow values by extrapolation may produce a significant amount of uncertainty on flood statistics and predictions yen 1994 petersen øverleir 2004 braca 2008 in this context the role of the hydrographer in river monitoring and reconstruction of the frc is crucial for discharge quantification water resources management and flood studies hydrographers should take into account the physical characteristics of a river gauge station the morphological evolution of the river and the cross section the presence of vegetation and its evolution over time the presence of hydraulic controls the accumulation of deposits and the eventual cleaning of the channel hamilton et al 2019 all this information should be associated with the gaugings in order to derive robust frcs that should take into consideration the hydraulic characteristics of the cross section unfortunately streamflow measurements are discontinuous in time and in most of the cases do not contain information about the hydrograph phases rising or falling limb this implies that time consuming and expensive field campaigns e g detert et al 2017 do not always provide an adequate dataset for the derivation of frcs it is frequent to deal with flow measurements limited in accuracy range of variability and total number for frcs reconstruction a new simplified methodology introduced by manfreda 2018 referred to as the flow area model is here tested in order to explore its relative advantage respect to the classical frcs therefore this manuscript addresses the reliability of frcs relationship in scarce data environments focusing in particular on i chosen model ii the number of measurements considered sample size and iii range on which those measurements stand two models namely the classical model and the flow area model for the derivation of frcs are explored and tested by using as case study field data collected at four different gauged river cross sections in central italy 2 methodology two approaches for estimation of the frc frcs are generally obtained using curve fitting methods with river stage h and discharge q observations the most common equation used to describe the relationship between h and q is clarke 1999 lambie 1978 mosley and mckerchar 1993 1 q α h h 0 β where α β and h 0 are calibration parameters equation 1 referred to as the classical model or model 1 in the next parts of the paper is fitted to the n observations of h i q i neglecting the monitoring procedure used to derive q in fact a standard method of stream flows monitoring is to regularly measure the averaged flow velocity v generally with few distributed point measurements and to evaluate the associated wetted area of the cross section ω exploiting both data sets and using the definition of the averaged flow velocity as v q ω manfreda 2018 proposed that frcs can be obtained as the product of these two regression functions 2 q v ω where v and ω describe the relationship between the mean flow velocity and the wetted area as a function of the river stage h h 0 these functions can be fitted using available observations and cross section surveys equation 2 is referred to as the flow area model or model 2 the flow area model consists of calibrating the aforementioned functions separately and the estimate of discharge is therefore given by their multiplication the great advantage of expressing the river discharge in terms of these two decoupled factors is that the geometrical relationship can also be obtained from topographic surveys the recent advancements in topographic surveys with modern portable gps laser scanners and photogrammetry can be useful in this regard in this context the structure from motion sfm technique can offer a low cost and timely option langhammer et al 2017 manfreda et al 2019 3 streamflow observations in the tiber river basin both methods are tested on four cross sections selected in the tiber river basin central italy that have been studied and monitored for several years moreover these case studies are well documented in a number of previous studies focusing on flow propagation and monitoring e g moramarco and dingman 2017 barbetta et al 2013 perumal et al 2010 a description of the considered hydrometric sites is given in fig 1 three of them are located on the tiber river i e santa lucia ponte felcino and ponte nuovo sites while the ponte rosciano gauged section is located on the chiascio river the main left tributary of tiber river in the upper part of the basin morphological characteristics of the sites selected are similar and can be classified in terms of channel type as foreseen in the classification by rinaldi et al 2013 2015 specifically all the investigated gauged sections are placed in a meandering single thread river with a sinuosity value defined as the ratio of stream length to valley length between 1 4 and 1 8 fig 2 shows the evolution of the cross section s geometry surveyed during different field campaigns as can be seen the shape of the sections is found quite symmetrical but not perfectly this condition is in accordance with the classification in terms of morphological characteristics of the four test sites considering that a symmetrical channel is typical of straight channel while an asymmetrical one is typically observed along meandering rivers it is found that ponte nuovo santa lucia ponte felcino and ponte rosciano sites are characterized by a channel slope equal to 0 0014 0 002 0 0015 0 002 respectively the comparison between different topographical surveys also indicates that the river cross sections did not evolve maintaining a relatively stable geometry over the considered time window the main characteristics of the selected river sections are summarized in table 1 santa lucia drains an area of 935 km2 and has a mean annual discharge of about 13 m3 s during the period 1987 2008 a total number of 34 flow measurements has been carried out in the range 0 72 239 35 m3 s the drainage area related to ponte felcino section is about 2035 km2 and the mean annual discharge 19 m3 s a sample of 46 discharge measurements is available for the analysis ponte rosciano is located on the chiascio river few kilometres upstream the confluence with the tiber river the drainage basin has an area of 1956 km2 and a sample of 44 flow measurements can be considered for the study the ponte nuovo section is located on the main river just downstream the confluence with the chiascio river and drains an area of 4145 km2 the largest measurements sample is available for this site see table 1 where the highest mean annual discharge is observed flow measurements at the four selected gage sites are carried out by current meter from cableway the discharge is assessed by applying the well known velocity area method at velocity profiles sampled in the cross sectional flow area herschy 1985 the velocity measurements for river flow estimation were carried out during flood events when they occurred and the conditions made the execution of operations by technicians safe for these reasons some of the available measurements were developed during floods rising limb and or recession limb period i e the highest ones while some others were executed with low medium flow condition because of the necessity to provide new data for the rating curve update at all the four gauged sections the maximum discharge was observed during the severe flood event that affected the tiber river basin on 25 november 2005 specifically a peak flow equal to about 400 880 1100 and 570 m3 s was recorded at santa lucia ponte felcino ponte nuovo and ponte rosciano section respectively the return period of this maximum discharge was quantified to be about 60 years for santa lucia and ponte nuovo sections 45 years for ponte felcino site and 40 years for ponte rosciano gauge fig 3 shows the scatter plots of the discharge measurements with the discharge q as a function of the river stage h and in the inset the description of the average flow velocity v and wetted cross section area ω as a function of the water level stage for the four investigated cross sections all data display a clear dependence from the water level stage but it can be noticed also a slight increase in the gaugings variability when moving to higher values for sake of clarity discharge measurements are reported in appendix a even if the plots are given in linear scale a preliminary check on a log log scale of the data have been carried out this highlighted a change in the slope of the discharge stage relationship in the log log scale for low flow values in fact low flow values are generally affected by local control but fortunately this limitation is washed out for higher flows fenton and keller 2001 therefore the fitting exercise described in the following sections has been carried out on a subset of the measurements sample that excludes low flow values 4 results comparison of the two models based on the available dataset the two models are compared following the methodology described here below the available dataset are used to generate random subsamples of given size and range in order to test the models performances in both calibration and validation where this last is carried out using the data excluded by the subsampling this approach can be iterated over several random combinations of samples exploring the performances of the two models under specific conditions the classical model model 1 described in eq 1 is fitted using the q h relationship by considering the streamflow discharge and the stage observed during the measurements while the flow area model model 2 is fitted on the two variables whose product leads to the discharge i e the flow velocity and the flow area this implies that errors in the fitting of the two functions v h or ω h may be amplified by the product leading to larger errors based on empirical evidence the following relationships are considered for the present case study 3 v λ ln h h 0 ξ 4 ω γ h h 0 δ where λ ξ γ δ and h0 are fitting coefficients it is worthy of underlining that the regression function for the mean flow velocity has been selected observing the specific behaviour of the measurements of the tiber river the trend of the mean flow velocity was a power law with exponent close to one almost a linear function in previous analysis carried out on smaller rivers manfreda 2018 but a logarithmic behaviour was found to be the best regression function for the present dataset such behaviour can be clearly recognized in the inset of fig 3 2000 subsets for each sample size of the original dataset are used to derive the frcs with both methods using a sample size ranging from five measurements up to the maximum length of the population minus five with five elements left for validation purposes in addition we also explore the role of the range of variability of the observations adopting a different strategy to extract our subset of samples limiting the range of observation to a given threshold of empirical non exceedance probability of the water level stages the threshold selected range between 0 5 and 0 9 it must be clarified that eq 4 is calibrated only once using all available observations of the cross section because it assumed that the cross section is stable over time and that these measurements can be always expanded using the topographic surveys this may represent an advantage for the structure of the frc given the fact that the cross section area varies non linearly with the river stage impacting significantly on the reliability of the method used 4 1 the impact of sample size models performances are quantitatively measured in terms of root mean square error rmse both in the calibration and validation phases the large number of subsamples generated allowed to explore the model performances under different conditions a preliminary result of the analyses is given in fig 4 that provides a comparison of the rmse of the two models in calibration a and validation b using different subsamples of different sizes of the measurements taken at ponte nuovo the graph provides a comparison of the rmse obtained with the two methods the comparison between the two models can be quantitatively interpreted using the 1 1 line the solid blue line in the plot that divides the area into two portions identifying where model 2 is underperforming upper left and where it is outperforming lower right in addition each point of the scatter plot is associated with a colour that represents the sample size adopted as expected the performances of the two models tend to deteriorate with the reduction of the sample size in fact the errors tend to increase for both methods as the number of samples decrease the classical model seems to be more robust when the number of observations increases while model 2 is outperforming model 1 in validation when the number of gaugings is limited it is interesting to note that the pattern of points is significantly different in the figures of calibration and validation results of calibrations are all in favour of model 1 that produces on the average lower rmse the situation changes significantly in validation where most of the points referring to low sample sizes points coloured in blue are in the lower right portion of the graph in this panel a cluster of points coloured in yellow larger sample size can be observed on the 1 1 line in the lower left corner of the graph this cluster is slightly shifted on the upward suggesting that both models become more robust with the increase of the number of samples but the classical model model 1 is preferable to characterize the frc on the other hand model 2 may help in interpreting frcs in data scarce environments for this reason it is interesting to further investigate when the flow area model should and can be applied to enhance the reliability of frcs the different performance of the two models is better emphasized in the graphs of fig 5 where the relative difference between the rmse of model 2 and 1 is plotted as a function of the sample size adopted in calibration the graphs show all the combinations explored using the available data in the four stations considered herein it can be noticed that there is a higher concentration of negative values negative values identify cases where model 2 is outperforming model 1 in the graphs on the right column validation respect to the ones on the left calibration in fact it can be stated that the classical model is generally better for fitting the discharge data while the advantages of the second approach can be appreciated during the validation phase this is due to the fact that the proposed model allows reaching a more robust description of the frcs even if it provides higher rmse in calibration see left column panels the orange line in the graph represents the mean values of such a difference as a function of the sample size adopted for the fitting this function may help in identifying the number of samples necessary to use the classical model model 1 or the proposed flow area model model 2 in particular we observed that the flow area model can be on average more convenient when the number of streamflow measurements is below 9 10 there is only one exception that is represented by the station of ponte felcino where flow area model provides better results over the entire range investigated up to a sample size of 30 increased robustness of the modelling approach should also lead to a reduction in the uncertainty of the resulting frcs uncertainty may be due to random errors in the measurements or epistemic errors due to temporal changes in the hydraulic conditions mcmillan and westerberg 2015 in the present case we assume that uncertainty is only related to random errors given the relative stability of the cross section over the considered period or instrumental errors therefore using the ensemble of 2000 frcs derived from different combinations of subsamples with assigned size it is possible to derive the mean discharge value and its confidence interval at 95 in function of the flow depth for a given sample size these results are reported in the graphs fig 6 for the ponte nuovo station fig 7 for the santa lucia station fig 8 for the ponte felcino station and fig 9 for the ponte rosciano station it can be observed that the use of the flow area model leads to a significant reduction of the uncertainty in the frcs especially during the extrapolation phase at the higher values of stage and discharge the differences between the two models tend to be smoothed out with the increase of the number of samples adopted but it is interesting to note that there is a significant reduction of the confidence bands with the use of the flow area model for all cases where the sample size is relatively small in order to provide a quantitative description of the fitting exercise with the two proposed model we have included in appendix b the mean value of the model parameters and their range of variability in the different configurations explored in terms of samples size it can be noticed that the range of variability of the model parameters reflects clearly the results discussed above 4 2 the impact of the range of variability of observations another limitation for the use of frcs is represented by the range of observations that are generally limited to the lower discharge values in fact the upper part of the frcs is the less explored and also the most critical for operational purposes therefore the second experiment is aimed at exploring the impact of the range of observations limiting our subsample to the discharge values with a non exceedance probability lower than a certain threshold set between 0 5 and 0 9 using this approach it is possible to derive frcs using only a subset of gaugings extracted from the lower values of discharge and validate the results on the remaining values including those exceeding the selected threshold results of this experiment are reported in the following graphs fig 10 which provide only the mean value of the relative difference of the rmse of the two methods as a function of the sample size and for the different thresholds investigated herein the results clearly show that the flow area model is useful especially when we deal with a limited range of observations in fact it is confirmed that the classical model performs better in calibration but the flow area model performs definitely much better in validation therefore the use of the cross section as a physical constraint for the derivation of the fitting function becomes more effective for the estimation of the discharge values outside the range of observation used for calibration higher discharges similarly to the previous section frcs and their respective confidence intervals have been derived in order to provide a visual description of the impact of the model choice on the frc in order to simplify the number of potential plots we selected one sample size and one non exceedance probability threshold to remove higher values from the training subsamples given the evidence of the previous section the sample size of n 10 was chosen in order to explore a condition where the two methods provided similar results in terms of rmse while the p h h 0 8 was chosen in order to remove only floods from the dataset consequently following the same procedure described in the previous section the mean frc and its confidence interval at 95 has been derived for a fixed sample size and a given threshold applied to remove higher discharge values from the subsample the frcs obtained are reported in fig 11 for each considered gauging stations it is observed a clear trend in reducing the uncertainty in the frcs when the flow area model is used this implies that the flow area model may reduce the uncertainty in the derivation of discharge values extrapolated from the frcs 5 conclusion the proposed procedure breaks down the estimation of frcs using flow velocity and wetted cross section functions in fact the cross section flow area ω can be derived directly from topographic surveys while the study of averaged flow velocities can be related to the river stage and used to derive the flow area rating curve this method represents a suitable alternative for the derivation of frcs allowing exploitation of the available information about the characteristics of river cross section geometry the comparison between the two models has been carried out on four gauged river sections selected in the upper tiber river basin where a fairly large number of streamflow measurements are available in particular the comparison is performed using different subsamples of river flow observations for calibration and validation the subsample size ranges from 5 up to 50 depending on the analysed gauging station and therefore on the number of available flow measurements in most of the calibration cases model 1 has slightly lower rmse values than the flow area model however model 2 displays some advantages in validation but the number of observations influences its performance in particular we observed a reduction of the differences of rmse values by increasing the number of samples showing a trend that both models converge with a large number of data and the classical model can be better if the sample size and the range of observation are adequately explored in turn flow area model seems to be more robust in data scarce environments where frcs can benefit from the use of the cross section flow area function in their derivation the analyses allowed to understand that the flow area proposed formulation may be extremely beneficial in data scarce environments and in all cases where the range of observation is limited in particular the flow area model should be adopted when less than 10 observations are available while the classical approach should be used when more measurements can be used for frc estimate on the other hand adopting the flow are model produced an improvement of results when the site is characterized by a limited range of observations typically only low medium range values are measured in this case the relative differences between the two models are even more emphasized showing significant improvements of the flow area model in validation over all the range of investigated subsample sizes given these promising results on this set of data the applicability of the flow area model should be further explored considering different river morphologies and also different flow regimes it must be stated that this approach does not overcome the problem of alluvial rivers where the river cross section may change significantly especially during floods but it represents a viable alternative in more stable rivers in such cases this simple methodology improves the physical consistency of frcs and it has great potential for application in data scarce environments author contributions all authors equally contributed to the manuscript declaration of competing interest the

5536,exploring the impacts of mining related human activities on catchment streamflow time series can facilitate understanding of streamflow response to external factors including climatic inputs this study selects the goulburn river catchment that is located in southeastern australia having more than 100 years of streamflow observations and more than 90 years of mining history and divides the streamflow period from 1913 to 2015 into four sub periods 1913 1920 no mining 1921 1950 small scale underground mining 1951 1980 commence of new underground mining and 1981 2015 large scale mining of open cut and underground mining process based hydrological modelling simhyd simple one parameter hydrological model budyko based method and a data driven approach the double mass curve dmc are used to assess mining related centennial streamflow changes and to quantify relative contributions of climate variability and mining activities on streamflow these results show that streamflow increased during periods of underground mining which is likely due to over pumping to sustain the underground mining the difference between the observed streamflow and the simhyd simulated was very marginal in the reference period of 1913 1920 while it increased by 3 39 mm yr 1 in 1921 1950 and by 10 51 mm yr 1 in 1951 1980 the dmc slope increased from 0 021 in 1913 1920 to 0 025 in 1921 1950 then 0 033 in 1951 1980 these impacts of underground mining on increased streamflow have been greatly reduced and even become negative when open cut mining was largely expanded the average difference of streamflow during the period of 1981 2015 was reduced from 10 51 mm yr 1 to 2 84 mm yr 1 the dmc slope decreased from 0 033 in 1951 1980 to 0 027 in 1981 2015 the contributions between climate changes and mining activities to streamflow changes estimated using these methods are consistent in trends in different mining periods but noticeably different in magnitudes keywords centennial streamflow mining

2016 guo et al 2019 svobodova et al 2019 the expansion in mining activities is disturbing nature landscapes altering hydrological process and deteriorating water quality at watershed or regional scales miller and zegre 2016 morrison et al 2018 in addition climate changes may also aggravate the alternation to landscape and the disturbance of subsurface conditions and eventually result in negative impact on streamflow miller and zegre 2016 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 analyzing the effects of mining related human activities and climate variability on streamflow time series can facilitate further exploring the regularity of streamflow and revealing the response of hydrological process zhang et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 there is a need for the related hydrologists and water resource managers to assess hydrologic conditions as if it is not appreciably affected by human activities such as coal mining water regulation or other water withdrawals or inputs in recent decades considerable attention has been paid to how much of the observed streamflow can be attributed to climate changes and human activities chiew et al 2018 wang et al 2012 several methods have been employed to estimate the fractional contributions and hydrological influences of mining under the background of climate changes two main methods modelling and data driven approaches have been extensively applied modelling methods are based on physical process of hydrology and are more complicated with uncertainty in their parameters xu et al 2014 large uncertainties in these results are expected because of the limitation of fundamental hypotheses shortcoming in model structures and the challenges in model parameter calibration and validation evans et al 2015 data driven approaches use simple linear relationship or nonlinear parametric estimation based on long term observations but generally lack physical meaning gao et al 2017 several studies have examined the hydrological consequences of mining by using rainfall runoff models and data driven approaches dhakate et al 2019 guo et al 2019 the mined catchment for mountaintop removal coal mining exported only 1 3 of their streamflow during storms while the reference watersheds with no mines exported 2 3 of their annual water yield nippgen et al 2017 decreased streamflow is also detected based on the monthly water balance model mwbm in the coal mining concentrated watershed in most parts of the chinese loess plateau guo et al 2019 these findings are non consistent with earlier studies in the region reporting increased streamflow from mined watersheds elsewhere the mined watershed would export more water than the unmined watershed exhibiting higher annual streamflow based on over 14 years of streamflow monitoring in eastern tennessee dickens et al 1989 surface coal mining has the potential to increase peak flows and reduce storm response lag times total streamflow peak flow and runoff ratio were generally larger in the mined catchment miller and zegre 2016 previous work has provided insights into hydrological processes coupling with mining activities however uncertainties in hydrological responses from mining type and scale are poorly understood there are significant challenges for understanding the hydrological consequence of mining activities australia is an important coal producing country and its coal remains a large source with 6 of the world s black coal and 25 of brown coal produced there chiew et al 2018 it is reported that coal production in australia increased 13 6 between 2005 and 2010 and 5 3 between 2009 and 2010 international energy agency 2011 such huge coal mining is bound to have a significant impact on the hydrological process of the catchments in the region of australia regional groundwater modelling indicates there is greater than 95 chance that groundwater table declines by greater than 0 2 5 m because of coal resource development in the hunter river in australia herron et al 2018 clarifying the impacts of mining activities on the hydrological process are needed for scientific water resource management and potentially to reduce unwanted hydrological impacts this study uses model simulation and data driven methods to isolate impacts of various mining activities on streamflow based on a centennial hydrological observation records with a long term 90 years mining history the specific objectives of this study include 1 examining the effects of mining activities on streamflow using hydrological modelling a processed based hydrological model simhyd and a budyko mean annual hydrological model and data driven the double mass curve approaches in the goulburn river catchment australia 2 quantifying the contributions of climate change

description the goulburn river catchment 31 46 32 51 s 149 40 150 36 e the largest tributary of the hunter river located in new south wales australia fig 1 the goulburn river catchment covers an area of 6540 km2 with elevation approximately from 100 to 1300 m rüdiger et al 2007 the catchment shows different topographic characteristics the main geological regions in the goulburn river watershed are livepool ranges northern merriwa plateau central goulburn valley and southern mountains story et al 2010 the goulburn river flows generally from west to east with its tributaries krui river merriwa river and wybong creek in the northern part and bylong river widden brook and baerami creek in the southern part of the goulburn river catchment the climate in the goulburn river catchment is temperate and semi arid monthly mean maximum temperature is around 30 c in summer and 14 c in winter while mean minimum temperature is around 16 c and 2 c respectively australian bureau of meteorology 1988 the annual potential evapotranspiration averages approximately 1300 mm with a minimum of 50 mm in july and a maximum of 180 mm in january rüdiger et al 2007 the annual average rainfall is approximately 650 mm and varies from 500 to 1100 mm across the goulburn river catchment rüdiger et al 2007 there are distinct soil types with basalt derived soils in the north and sandstone derived soils in the south the northern catchment is mainly cleared for cropping and grazing while the southern part is covered by dense vegetation coal mining is the most important human activity with a history of nearly a century in the goulburn river catchment including underground mining and open cut mining there are three coal mines in the catchment fig 1 the ulan mine complex umc covers an approximate area of 13 772 ha which located at the headwaters of the goulburn river underground mining in the ulan mine could date back to the early 1920s and its open cut mining was established in the 1980s http www ulancoal com au en about us pages history aspx the second called wilpinjong coal mine wcm approximately 10 km from the ulan mine which is an open cut mine and its mining began in 2006 https www mining technology com projects wilpinjongthermalcoa the last one the moolarben coal complex mcc is located approximately 40 km north of mudgee the project of mcc including three open cut mining area and one underground mining was approved in 2007 and all of them commenced in 2010 https www yancoal com au page en assets mine sites moolarben 2 2 data 2 2 1 streamflow daily streamflow at the gauge of 210 006 with the observation for more than a century 1913 2015 was obtained from the nsw office of water https www waternsw com au other hydrological gauges in the goulburn river catchment have limited observation records in streamflow and their records are much later than the history of mining the gauge of 210 006 is the only hydrological gauge with pre mining data and a complete monitoring streamflow series through four different mining stages there were no mining activities at the first stage 1913 1920 and therefore this stage is considered as a reference period the second stage 1921 1950 experienced intermittent small scale underground mining ulan no 1 mine the third stage 1951 1980 went through a new period of underground mining with a new mine commenced ulan no 2 mine the last stage 1981 2015 experienced coexistence of large scale open cut mining and underground mining 2 2 2 meteorological data daily meteorological variables including precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration pet in 1913 2015 were obtained as forcing data from silo data drill of the queensland department of natural resources and water www nrw gov au silo the dataset is gridded with a spatial resolution of 0 05 interpolated from approximately 4600 point measurements across australia jeffrey et al 2001 the gridded p and pet were aggregated to each catchment by averaging their values with the corresponding area weights for those grid cells within the catchment the aggregated p and pet were then taken as inputs for hydrological modelling and data driven approaches the silo meteorological variables are complete without missing data 2 2 3 coal mine history the mining history in the goulburn river catchment was mainly collected from the coal and coal seam gas resource assessment for the hunter subregion hodgkinson et al 2015 the related websites and the operation plans of coal mining companies the information includes the name of coal mine type of mining activity and details of development plan table 1 2 3 methods three approaches including simhyd model budyko based method and the dmc were conducted to analyse streamflow changes caused by mining activities and to separate the relative contributions of climate change and mining activities on catchment streamflow the impact of mining activities on the streamflow process is analysed by comparing the difference between the simhyd model simulated streamflow and the observed streamflow budyko based method reflects the nonlinear response of mining activities to the changes in water and energy availability and parameter n in the budyko entails land surface properties which refers to mining influences in the study in the dmc the contribution of mining activities to streamflow is reflected in the dmc slope changes of linear relationship between cumulative streamflow to cumulative precipitation 2 3 1 simhyd modelling simhyd model a lumped conceptual daily rainfall runoff model has been extensively used for the simulation of rainfall runoff process across australia chiew and mcmahon 1994 the version of the simhyd model used in the study has 9 parameters and the inputs into the models are daily p and daily pet the structure of the simhyd model and the model parameters and algorithms are described in details in the document published by zhang and chiew 2009 the simhyd model was calibrated against daily streamflow time series from 1913 to 1920 first stage with no mining to simulate streamflow for the post mining period of 1921 2015 with the first 2 years 1913 1914 are used to warm up the model a global optimizer the genetic algorithm ga was used for parameter optimization in the simhyd model for the gauged catchment 210006 in the ga a population size of 100 and the maxim generation of 100 were set up for searching the optimum point two criteria are used for the model assessment nash sutcliffe efficiency nse mccuen et al 2006 and absolute water balance error percentage wbe zhang et al 2015 the performances of model calibration and validation are shown in fig 2 a the results of calibration and validation are generally satisfactory with nse value greater than 0 6 and wbe of less than 30 the regression slope of the observed and simulated streamflow is close to 1 indicating a good prediction fig 2b the difference δr t between the measured streamflow caused by human activities and the natural streamflow in the reference period is divided into two parts one is the impact part δr h by human activity and the other is the impact part δr c by climate change the formula is 1 δ r t r hr r n 2 δ r h r hr r hn 3 δ r c r hn r n 4 η h δ r h δ r t 100 5 η c δ r c δ r t 100 where δr t is the total amount of streamflow change mm δr h is the streamflow change impacted by human activity mm δr c is the amount of streamflow impacted by climate change mm r hr is the measured streamflow at the stage of human activity impact r n is the natural streamflow at the reference period r hn is the natural streamflow at the stage of human activity η h is the contribution rate of human activities to streamflow η c is the contribution rate of climate change to streamflow 2 3 2 budyko framework and elasticity method budyko hypothesis budyko 1974 states that the annual water balance can be expressed as a function balance between available water p and r and energy demand pet and is an effective tool to explore the interactions among climate hydrology and catchment characteristics liang et al 2015 yang and yang 2011 used the budyko framework to deduce a water energy balance equation as 11 et p p e t p n p e t n 1 n where p et and pet denote precipitation mm actual evaporation mm and potential evaporation mm respectively the n is the parameter of catchment characteristics which represent the underlying changes in the environmental conditions of the catchment liang et al 2015 in the study parameter n represents the impact of mining activities on catchment streamflow for the long term the water balance equation can be simplified as r p et assuming that the change of catchment soil water storage of is negligible for a long period of time assuming p pet and n are independent the equation 11 can be expressed as r f p pet n the first order approximation of streamflow change r can be expressed as a total differentiation xu et al 2014 12 dr r p d p r p e t d p e t r n d n the elastic coefficient of streamflow to a specific independent variable p pet n can be expressed as follows 13 ε x i r x i x i r where ε x i is the elasticity coefficient of streamflow to a specific independent variable x i with x i denoting p pet n so the equation 12 can be expressed as 14 d r x i ε x i r x i d x i the fractional impacts of climate changes and human activities on the streamflow can be express as follows 15 δ r c ε p r d p p ε pet r d pet pet 16 δ r h δ r δ r c the relative contribution of climate changes and human activities on the streamflow can be expressed as 17 η c δ r c δ r 100 18 η h δ r h δ r 100 2 3 3 double mass curve dmc the double mass curve dmc is a simple visual method in hydrology and usually used to quantify the relative contributions of climatic variability and human activities to hydrological changes gao et al 2017 wang et al 2012 in the study the dmc is composed of cumulative values of annual streamflow plotted against annual precipitation during a period of 1913 2015 if the mining impacts on streamflow is constant or negligible the plot of these two cumulative variables precipitation and streamflow is a straight line significant change in dmc slopes indicates the changes due to the contribution of mining activities in order to evaluate the impact of mining activities on the streamflow process the changes of cumulative streamflow and precipitation were divided into four stages according to the mining history and break of streamflow mentioned in section 2 2 1 the slope of the linear relationship between cumulative streamflow and cumulative precipitation in the reference period is sra pa and after the reference period is srb pb respectively the contributions of the precipitation and mining activities to the streamflow change can be expressed as 6 δ r t s rb p b δ p 7 δ r c s ra p a δ p 8 δ r h δ r t δ r c 9 η h δ r h δ r t 100 10 η c δ r c δ r t 100 where δr t is the total amount of streamflow change mm δr h is the streamflow change impacted by human activity mm δr c is the streamflow change impacted by climate change mm δp is the amount of precipitation change η h is the contribution rate of human activities to streamflow η c is the contribution rate of climate change to streamflow 3 results 3 1 changes in streamflow impacted by underground mining fig 3 summarizes the streamflow difference between the smhyd modelled and the observed during different periods it is clear that underground mining activities had positive effects on streamflow in the goulburn river catchment fig 3a the differences in hydrograph demonstrate the hydrologic response of the underground mining exhibiting generally higher streamflow during the underground mining periods fig 3b in the reference period of 1913 1920 the difference between observed and simulated streamflow is very close to the zero line with the average streamflow difference being 0 11 mm yr 1 while during ulan no 1 underground mining period the positive effects caused by underground mining were obvious with the average streamflow increased by 3 39 mm yr 1 in 1921 1950 this effect of underground mining was enhanced during the ulan no 2 underground mining period and the streamflow increased by 10 51 mm yr 1 in 1951 1980 fig 4 summarizes the dmc results during the four periods significant shift of the dmc also suggests that the factor other than precipitation affect the changes in streamflow this shift is mainly caused by coal mining activities in the goulburn river catchment as shown in fig 4 a straight line was observed between accumulated annual streamflow and accumulated annual precipitation in the period of 1913 to 1920 this indicates that the variations in streamflow are mainly affected by changes in precipitation under the condition that there was no impact of mining activities during the second period of 1921 1950 the dmc slope accumulated annual streamflow against accumulated annual precipitation increased to 0 025 from 0 021 obtained in 1913 1920 suggesting that more streamflow was generated than the predicted the streamflow deviations were the effects of ulan no 1 underground mining with the intermittent supply of coal to local markets on a small scale during the period of 1921 1950 during the third period of 1951 1980 with the start of new underground mining of ulan no 2 the effect of the increase in streamflow was more pronounced reflected by the greater dmc slope of 0 033 3 2 changes in streamflow impacted by open cut mining open cut mining significantly changed the impact of underground mining on streamflow and exhibited a tendency to decrease streamflow in the goulburn river catchment during the period of 1981 2015 the impact of underground mining on increasing streamflow has been greatly reduced with the expansion of open cut mining and even negative effects on streamflow have occurred fig 3b compared with the third period of 1951 1980 the average difference of streamflow during the fourth period of 1981 2015 was reduced from 10 51 mm yr 1 to 2 84 mm yr 1 a reduction of 73 this result indicates that the effect of open cut mining on reducing streamflow offsets the impact of underground mining despite the large scale expansion of ulan no 2 underground mining and the commence of ulan no 3 underground mining during this period the shift of the dmc in 1981 2015 further demonstrates that open cut mining reduces the impact of underground mining on streamflow in the goulburn river catchment fig 4 the dmc slope did not continue to increase due to the augmentation of underground mining operations but a trend of the dmc slope to decrease appeared when overlapping the influence of open cut mining the dmc slope decreased from 0 033 in 1951 1980 to 0 027 in 1981 2015 3 3 separation of the effects of climate and coal mining on streamflow changes the anthropogenic effects on streamflow were mainly caused by the changes of coal mining activities in the goulburn river catchment the effects of climatic variability and mining activity on streamflow in the goulburn river catchment were shown in table 2 the differences between the observed annual streamflow and the predicted are attributed to coal mining activity disturbances the results based on simhyd modeling indicate that for the change of streamflow climate changes contributed 79 and mining activities contributed 21 during the period of 1921 1950 when ulan no 1 underground mine supplied coals to local markets on a small scale in 1951 1980 the change of streamflow was mainly caused by ulan no 2 underground mining activities and that contributed 57 while climate change contributed only 43 the contribution of mining activities to streamflow decreased to 12 in the latest stage of 1981 2015 when a combined impact existed with underground mining increasing streamflow but open cut mining decreasing it the deviations in the dmc slopes are the effects of mining disturbance on annual streamflow in the goulburn river catchment the results based on the dmc method show that the contribution to streamflow changes caused by mining activities were 16 in 1921 1950 slightly lower than the simulations 21 similarly the contribution of underground mining activities to streamflow increased to 36 in 1951 1980 then in the latest period of 1981 2015 the combined contribution of open cut mining and underground mining to streamflow changes is 22 for the budyko based method climate variability contributed 44 to the changes of annual streamflow and underground mining activities contributed 56 in 1921 1950 the change of streamflow in 1951 1980 was mainly caused by underground mining activities and that contributed 64 while climate change contributed only 36 during the last period of 1981 2015 the contribution of mining activities to streamflow decreased to 54 4 discussion 4 1 the underlying mechanism of mining impact on streamflow coal mining activities can have severe and long term impacts on catchment hydrological process and stream ecosystems harding and boothroyd 2004 miller 2013 sengupta 2018 however mining related evidence is limited in the response of hydrologic mechanism due to lack of consistent long term scale appropriate gauged watersheds miller and zegre 2016 it is challenging to conduct research in a heavily disturbed and changing environment to isolate the hydrological impacts of overlapping mining activities in the goulburn river catchment more than 100 years of hydrological observation records and 90 years of coal mining history provide favourable conditions to reveal the response mechanism of the mining related hydrological process different mining stages show different hydrological responses our results show that streamflow increased during periods of underground mining and the impacts of underground mining on increased streamflow have been greatly reduced and even become negative when combining with the impacts of expending open cut mining most surface related mining studies found that the mining would reduce stormflows and enhance baseflows than the unmined catchment during large rainfall events grigg and hughes 2018 nippgen et al 2017 previous studies provided some evidences that the increase in baseflow was caused by open cut mining and the increased baseflow was likely caused by the change in overland flow and infiltration associated with landscape changes sun et al 2020 to a certain extent open cut mining has a trapping effect on rainfall and runoff these impacts can be well explored based on paired catchments with similar sizes however finding appropriate catchments is almost impossible considering the landscape characteristics such as the long disturbance history the mosaic of land cover miller and zegre 2016 the effects of open cut mining on streamflow are less well understood both increase and decrease streamflow have been observed dhakate et al 2019 ferrari et al 2009 zhao et al 2017 differential responses of streamflow to surface mining are primarily due to different mining and reclamation practices different scales of disturbance and different disturbance histories underground mining drastically alters the subsurface structure and increases hydrologic connectivity that efficiently connect groundwater to surface streams booth 2007 tomlinson and boulton 2010 substantial volumes of water can be transferred between adjacent catchments and between surface and underground that can diminish or exacerbate surface mining driven changes in hydrology brunke and gonser 1997 renard and allard 2013 previous studies focused on changes in hydrological processes impacted by mining activities during rainstorm and flood events ignoring the impact of dewatering on hydrological process during long term mining activities the bioregional assessment program confirmed that coal resource developments affect groundwater hydrology as a result of aquifer depressurisation from mine dewatering and changes to the subsurface physical flow paths such as hydraulic enhancement above longwall mines herron et al 2018 large groundwater abstraction has also caused substantial drop in groundwater level and aquifer dewatering in the hunter river catchment peeters et al 2017 where the long term decline in water levels was related to over pumping of groundwater and reduction in recharge entering the aquifer system owing to over a century old coal mining activity groundwater in this region was under stress from over pumping to sustain the underground mining operation results from the bioregional assessment program show that the cumulative groundwater drawdowns of greater than 0 2 5 m is very likely due to coal resource development in the future herron et al 2018 dewatering activity to sustain the underground mining operations and the pumped water discharged into the stream river after treatment maybe have a great impact on the catchment hydrological process pumping appears to be an important reason for the increase in streamflow during the period of underground mining in the goulburn river catchment it is likely to be the main reason for the increase in streamflow relating to the intensity of over pumping to sustain the underground mining 4 2 uncertainty in contribution analysis quantifying the contributions of climate change and human activities to the streamflow changes is an important issue in hydrology liang et al 2015 wang et al 2012 process based modelling and data driven approaches are two different types of methods to estimate the contribution of climate change and human activities on catchment hydrological processes the process based method uses physically hydrological model to separate the contribution of climate variability to streamflow changes by varying the meteorological inputs for fixed model parameters based on reference period wang et al 2013 xu et al 2014 process based method can reproduce natural streamflow processes without human influence data driven approach estimates the streamflow using statistical regression or nonparametric estimation to separate the relative contributions of climate change and human activities fu et al 2007 seyoum et al 2015 climate changes and human activities are considered as the key factors affecting hydrological processes and are applied to assess their impacts on catchment streamflow in addition to the direct impact of climate changes mining activities are the most important factor affecting the hydrological process in the goulburn river catchment the catchment is largely unregulated i e without subject to dam regulation and large scale ecological restoration the bioregional assessment programme and mining operation plans provide details on the ecology hydrology geology and coal mining development which indicate coal mining is the main anthropogenic factor affecting streamflow changes in the goulburn river catchment herron et al 2018 three approaches including the simhyd model budyko based and dmc approaches were conducted to separate the relative contributions of climate change and mining activities on catchment streamflow as can be seen relative contributions obtained from the three approaches are noticeably different especially for the budyko framework the fractional contribution of climate changes based on budyko framework includes the impact of pet which may be an important reason for their large differences furthermore the budyko based method had limited performance in differentiating the influencing factors for streamflow changes liang et al 2015 liu et al 2017 the variability of climate changes could increase the error in the fractional contribution when evaluated by budyko based model liu et al 2017 variation in annual average precipitation of 10 mm can cause a 0 5 5 in error in the precipitation induced contribution to streamflow changes and when the variation reached 50 mm the error increased to 2 5 25 yang et al 2014a estimation using elasticity coefficients based on the hypothesis that influences from climate change and human activates are independent however the underlying mechanism may be more complex due to the interactions among climate vegetation soil conditions human activates and hydrological processes in different catchments this complex interaction has created a great uncertainty in separating the effects of climate change and human activities on hydrological processes even in the same catchment there were considerable differences in the contribution rates of climate variation and human activates in the previous studies liu et al 2017 there exists a potential error when the climate elasticity was estimated as a first order approximation the first order taylor expansion yang et al 2014b comparing the results of our studies we found that the major causes for the changes of streamflow in the goulburn river catchment were consistent though there existed noticeable relative contribution ratios in different mining periods the different rates of estimated contributions indicate that there is still lots of uncertainty to quantify climate change and mining activities impact on the streamflow and more studies are required 5 conclusions in the study process based modelling and data driven approaches were used to assess streamflow changes related to coal mining and to quantify the contributions of climate variability and mining activities on the streamflow changes in the goulburn river catchment based on history of mining operation and the break changes of streamflow the centennial period of streamflow process from 1913 to 2015 was divided into four sub periods then the streamflow changes associated with underground mining and open cut mining have been quantified using the simhyd model budyko based and dmc approaches this study found that there existed noticeable streamflow increments during the periods of underground mining in the goulburn river catchment which is very likely because of over pumping to sustain the underground mining furthermore there is a certain correlation between the increase in streamflow and the intensity of underground mining the third period the effect of underground mining on streamflow is greatly reduced when superimposed open cut mining activities contributions in different mining periods are determined by the catchment climate and mining operations the climate coal mining hydrology interaction is considered in separation of the relative contribution based on the simhyd model budyko based and dmc approaches the results from the three approaches are consistent in trends during different mining periods but noticeably different in relative contribution ratios indicating the large uncertainty among them how to reduce the uncertainty of quantifying mining impact on streamflow becomes an open question for hydrologists to investigate in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

5536,exploring the impacts of mining related human activities on catchment streamflow time series can facilitate understanding of streamflow response to external factors including climatic inputs this study selects the goulburn river catchment that is located in southeastern australia having more than 100 years of streamflow observations and more than 90 years of mining history and divides the streamflow period from 1913 to 2015 into four sub periods 1913 1920 no mining 1921 1950 small scale underground mining 1951 1980 commence of new underground mining and 1981 2015 large scale mining of open cut and underground mining process based hydrological modelling simhyd simple one parameter hydrological model budyko based method and a data driven approach the double mass curve dmc are used to assess mining related centennial streamflow changes and to quantify relative contributions of climate variability and mining activities on streamflow these results show that streamflow increased during periods of underground mining which is likely due to over pumping to sustain the underground mining the difference between the observed streamflow and the simhyd simulated was very marginal in the reference period of 1913 1920 while it increased by 3 39 mm yr 1 in 1921 1950 and by 10 51 mm yr 1 in 1951 1980 the dmc slope increased from 0 021 in 1913 1920 to 0 025 in 1921 1950 then 0 033 in 1951 1980 these impacts of underground mining on increased streamflow have been greatly reduced and even become negative when open cut mining was largely expanded the average difference of streamflow during the period of 1981 2015 was reduced from 10 51 mm yr 1 to 2 84 mm yr 1 the dmc slope decreased from 0 033 in 1951 1980 to 0 027 in 1981 2015 the contributions between climate changes and mining activities to streamflow changes estimated using these methods are consistent in trends in different mining periods but noticeably different in magnitudes keywords centennial streamflow mining

2016 guo et al 2019 svobodova et al 2019 the expansion in mining activities is disturbing nature landscapes altering hydrological process and deteriorating water quality at watershed or regional scales miller and zegre 2016 morrison et al 2018 in addition climate changes may also aggravate the alternation to landscape and the disturbance of subsurface conditions and eventually result in negative impact on streamflow miller and zegre 2016 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 analyzing the effects of mining related human activities and climate variability on streamflow time series can facilitate further exploring the regularity of streamflow and revealing the response of hydrological process zhang et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 there is a need for the related hydrologists and water resource managers to assess hydrologic conditions as if it is not appreciably affected by human activities such as coal mining water regulation or other water withdrawals or inputs in recent decades considerable attention has been paid to how much of the observed streamflow can be attributed to climate changes and human activities chiew et al 2018 wang et al 2012 several methods have been employed to estimate the fractional contributions and hydrological influences of mining under the background of climate changes two main methods modelling and data driven approaches have been extensively applied modelling methods are based on physical process of hydrology and are more complicated with uncertainty in their parameters xu et al 2014 large uncertainties in these results are expected because of the limitation of fundamental hypotheses shortcoming in model structures and the challenges in model parameter calibration and validation evans et al 2015 data driven approaches use simple linear relationship or nonlinear parametric estimation based on long term observations but generally lack physical meaning gao et al 2017 several studies have examined the hydrological consequences of mining by using rainfall runoff models and data driven approaches dhakate et al 2019 guo et al 2019 the mined catchment for mountaintop removal coal mining exported only 1 3 of their streamflow during storms while the reference watersheds with no mines exported 2 3 of their annual water yield nippgen et al 2017 decreased streamflow is also detected based on the monthly water balance model mwbm in the coal mining concentrated watershed in most parts of the chinese loess plateau guo et al 2019 these findings are non consistent with earlier studies in the region reporting increased streamflow from mined watersheds elsewhere the mined watershed would export more water than the unmined watershed exhibiting higher annual streamflow based on over 14 years of streamflow monitoring in eastern tennessee dickens et al 1989 surface coal mining has the potential to increase peak flows and reduce storm response lag times total streamflow peak flow and runoff ratio were generally larger in the mined catchment miller and zegre 2016 previous work has provided insights into hydrological processes coupling with mining activities however uncertainties in hydrological responses from mining type and scale are poorly understood there are significant challenges for understanding the hydrological consequence of mining activities australia is an important coal producing country and its coal remains a large source with 6 of the world s black coal and 25 of brown coal produced there chiew et al 2018 it is reported that coal production in australia increased 13 6 between 2005 and 2010 and 5 3 between 2009 and 2010 international energy agency 2011 such huge coal mining is bound to have a significant impact on the hydrological process of the catchments in the region of australia regional groundwater modelling indicates there is greater than 95 chance that groundwater table declines by greater than 0 2 5 m because of coal resource development in the hunter river in australia herron et al 2018 clarifying the impacts of mining activities on the hydrological process are needed for scientific water resource management and potentially to reduce unwanted hydrological impacts this study uses model simulation and data driven methods to isolate impacts of various mining activities on streamflow based on a centennial hydrological observation records with a long term 90 years mining history the specific objectives of this study include 1 examining the effects of mining activities on streamflow using hydrological modelling a processed based hydrological model simhyd and a budyko mean annual hydrological model and data driven the double mass curve approaches in the goulburn river catchment australia 2 quantifying the contributions of climate change and mining activities to streamflow in overlapping mining disturbed catchments and 3 uncovering the pros and cons and uncertainty of these different approaches 2 data and methods 2 1 catchment description the goulburn river catchment 31 46 32 51 s 149 40 150 36 e the largest tributary of the hunter river located in new south wales australia fig 1 the goulburn river catchment covers an area of 6540 km2 with elevation approximately from 100 to 1300 m rüdiger et al 2007 the catchment shows different topographic characteristics the main geological regions in the goulburn river watershed are livepool ranges northern merriwa plateau central goulburn valley and southern mountains story et al 2010 the goulburn river flows generally from west to east with its tributaries krui river merriwa river and wybong creek in the northern part and bylong river widden brook and baerami creek in the southern part of the goulburn river catchment the climate in the goulburn river catchment is temperate and semi arid monthly mean maximum temperature is around 30 c in summer and 14 c in winter while mean minimum temperature is around 16 c and 2 c respectively australian bureau of meteorology 1988 the annual potential evapotranspiration averages approximately 1300 mm with a minimum of 50 mm in july and a maximum of 180 mm in january rüdiger et al 2007 the annual average rainfall is approximately 650 mm and varies from 500 to 1100 mm across the goulburn river catchment rüdiger et al 2007 there are distinct soil types with basalt derived soils in the north and sandstone derived soils in the south the northern catchment is mainly cleared for cropping and grazing while the southern part is covered by dense vegetation coal mining is the most important human activity with a history of nearly a century in the goulburn river catchment including underground mining and open cut mining there are three coal mines in the catchment fig 1 the ulan mine complex umc covers an approximate area of 13 772 ha which located at the headwaters of the goulburn river underground mining in the ulan mine could date back to the early 1920s and its open cut mining was established in the 1980s http www ulancoal com au en about us pages history aspx the second called wilpinjong coal mine wcm approximately 10 km from the ulan mine which is an open cut mine and its mining began in 2006 https www mining technology com projects wilpinjongthermalcoa the last one the moolarben coal complex mcc is located approximately 40 km north of mudgee the project of mcc including three open cut mining area and one underground mining was approved in 2007 and all of them commenced in 2010 https www yancoal com au page en assets mine sites moolarben 2 2 data 2 2 1 streamflow daily streamflow at the gauge of 210 006 with the observation for more than a century 1913 2015 was obtained from the nsw office of water https www waternsw com au other hydrological gauges in the goulburn river catchment have limited observation records in streamflow and their records are much later than the history of mining the gauge of 210 006 is the only hydrological gauge with pre mining data and a complete monitoring streamflow series through four different mining stages there were no mining activities at the first stage 1913 1920 and therefore this stage is considered as a reference period the second stage 1921 1950 experienced intermittent small scale underground mining ulan no 1 mine the third stage 1951 1980 went through a new period of underground mining with a new mine commenced ulan no 2 mine the last stage 1981 2015 experienced coexistence of large scale open cut mining and underground mining 2 2 2 meteorological data daily meteorological variables including precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration pet in 1913 2015 were obtained as forcing data from silo data drill of the queensland department of natural resources and water www nrw gov au silo the dataset is gridded with a spatial resolution of 0 05 interpolated from approximately 4600 point measurements across australia jeffrey et al 2001 the gridded p and pet were aggregated to each catchment by averaging their values with the corresponding area weights for those grid cells within the catchment the aggregated p and pet were then taken as inputs for hydrological modelling and data driven approaches the silo meteorological variables are complete without missing data 2 2 3 coal mine history the mining history in the goulburn river catchment was mainly collected from the coal and coal seam gas resource assessment for the hunter subregion hodgkinson et al 2015 the related websites and the operation plans of coal mining companies the information includes the name of coal mine type of mining activity and details of development plan table 1 2 3 methods three approaches including simhyd model budyko based method and the dmc were conducted to analyse streamflow changes caused by mining activities and to separate the relative contributions of climate change and mining activities on catchment streamflow the impact of mining activities on the streamflow process is analysed by comparing the difference between the simhyd model simulated streamflow and the observed streamflow budyko based method reflects the nonlinear response of mining activities to the changes in water and energy availability and parameter n in the budyko entails land surface properties which refers to mining influences in the study in the dmc the contribution of mining activities to streamflow is reflected in the dmc slope changes of linear relationship between cumulative streamflow to cumulative precipitation 2 3 1 simhyd modelling simhyd model a lumped conceptual daily rainfall runoff model has been extensively used for the simulation of rainfall runoff process across australia chiew and mcmahon 1994 the version of the simhyd model used in the study has 9 parameters and the inputs into the models are daily p and daily pet the structure of the simhyd model and the model parameters and algorithms are described in details in the document published by zhang and chiew 2009 the simhyd model was calibrated against daily streamflow time series from 1913 to 1920 first stage with no mining to simulate streamflow for the post mining period of 1921 2015 with the first 2 years 1913 1914 are used to warm up the model a global optimizer the genetic algorithm ga was used for parameter optimization in the simhyd model for the gauged catchment 210006 in the ga a population size of 100 and the maxim generation of 100 were set up for searching the optimum point two criteria are used for the model assessment nash sutcliffe efficiency nse mccuen et al 2006 and absolute water balance error percentage wbe zhang et al 2015 the performances of model calibration and validation are shown in fig 2 a the results of calibration and validation are generally satisfactory with nse value greater than 0 6 and wbe of less than 30 the regression slope of the observed and simulated streamflow is close to 1 indicating a good prediction fig 2b the difference δr t between the measured streamflow caused by human activities and the natural streamflow in the reference period is divided into two parts one is the impact part δr h by human activity and the other is the impact part δr c by climate change the formula is 1 δ r t r hr r n 2 δ r h r hr r hn 3 δ r c r hn r n 4 η h δ r h δ r t 100 5 η c δ r c δ r t 100 where δr t is the total amount of streamflow change mm δr h is the streamflow change impacted by human activity mm δr c is the amount of streamflow impacted by climate change mm r hr is the measured streamflow at the stage of human activity impact r n is the natural streamflow at the reference period r hn is the natural streamflow at the stage of human activity η h is the contribution rate of human activities to streamflow η c is the contribution rate of climate change to streamflow 2 3 2 budyko framework and elasticity method budyko hypothesis budyko 1974 states that the annual water balance can be expressed as a function balance between available water p and r and energy demand pet and is an effective tool to explore the interactions among climate hydrology and catchment characteristics liang et al 2015 yang and yang 2011 used the budyko framework to deduce a water energy balance equation as 11 et p p e t p n p e t n 1 n where p et and pet denote precipitation mm actual evaporation mm and potential evaporation mm respectively the n is the parameter of catchment characteristics which represent the underlying changes in the environmental conditions of the catchment liang et al 2015 in the study parameter n represents the impact of mining activities on catchment streamflow for the long term the water balance equation can be simplified as r p et assuming that the change of catchment soil water storage of is negligible for a long period of time assuming p pet and n are independent the equation 11 can be expressed as r f p pet n the first order approximation of streamflow change r can be expressed as a total differentiation xu et al 2014 12 dr r p d p r p e t d p e t r n d n the elastic coefficient of streamflow to a specific independent variable p pet n can be expressed as follows 13 ε x i r x i x i r where ε x i is the elasticity coefficient of streamflow to a specific independent variable x i with x i denoting p pet n so the equation 12 can be expressed as 14 d r x i ε x i r x i d x i the fractional impacts of climate changes and human activities on the streamflow can be express as follows 15 δ r c ε p r d p p ε pet r d pet pet 16 δ r h δ r δ r c the relative contribution of climate changes and human activities on the streamflow can be expressed as 17 η c δ r c δ r 100 18 η h δ r h δ r 100 2 3 3 double mass curve dmc the double mass curve dmc is a simple visual method in hydrology and usually used to quantify the relative contributions of climatic variability and human activities to hydrological changes gao et al 2017 wang et al 2012 in the study the dmc is composed of cumulative values of annual streamflow plotted against annual precipitation during a period of 1913 2015 if the mining impacts on streamflow is constant or negligible the plot of these two cumulative variables precipitation and streamflow is a straight line significant change in dmc slopes indicates the changes due to the contribution of mining activities in order to evaluate the impact of mining activities on the streamflow process the changes of cumulative streamflow and precipitation were divided into four stages according to the mining history and break of streamflow mentioned in section 2 2 1 the slope of the linear relationship between cumulative streamflow and cumulative precipitation in the reference period is sra pa and after the reference period is srb pb respectively the contributions of the precipitation and mining activities to the streamflow change can be expressed as 6 δ r t s rb p b δ p 7 δ r c s ra p a δ p 8 δ r h δ r t δ r c 9 η h δ r h δ r t 100 10 η c δ r c δ r t 100 where δr t is the total amount of streamflow change mm δr h is the streamflow change impacted by human activity mm δr c is the streamflow change impacted by climate change mm δp is the amount of precipitation change η h is the contribution rate of human activities to streamflow η c is the contribution rate of climate change to streamflow 3 results 3 1 changes in streamflow impacted by underground mining fig 3 summarizes the streamflow difference between the smhyd modelled and the observed during different periods it is clear that underground mining activities had positive effects on streamflow in the goulburn river catchment fig 3a the differences in hydrograph demonstrate the hydrologic response of the underground mining exhibiting generally higher streamflow during the underground mining periods fig 3b in the reference period of 1913 1920 the difference between observed and simulated streamflow is very close to the zero line with the average streamflow difference being 0 11 mm yr 1 while during ulan no 1 underground mining period the positive effects caused by underground mining were obvious with the average streamflow increased by 3 39 mm yr 1 in 1921 1950 this effect of underground mining was enhanced during the ulan no 2 underground mining period and the streamflow increased by 10 51 mm yr 1 in 1951 1980 fig 4 summarizes the dmc results during the four periods significant shift of the dmc also suggests that the factor other than precipitation affect the changes in streamflow this shift is mainly caused by coal mining activities in the goulburn river catchment as shown in fig 4 a straight line was observed between accumulated annual streamflow and accumulated annual precipitation in the period of 1913 to 1920 this indicates that the variations in streamflow are mainly affected by changes in precipitation under the condition that there was no impact of mining activities during the second period of 1921 1950 the dmc slope accumulated annual streamflow against accumulated annual precipitation increased to 0 025 from 0 021 obtained in 1913 1920 suggesting that more streamflow was generated than the predicted the streamflow deviations were the effects of ulan no 1 underground mining with the intermittent supply of coal to local markets on a small scale during the period of 1921 1950 during the third period of 1951 1980 with the start of new underground mining of ulan no 2 the effect of the increase in streamflow was more pronounced reflected by the greater dmc slope of 0 033 3 2 changes in streamflow impacted by open cut mining open cut mining significantly changed the impact of underground mining on streamflow and exhibited a tendency to decrease streamflow in the goulburn river catchment during the period of 1981 2015 the impact of underground mining on increasing streamflow has been greatly reduced with the expansion of open cut mining and even negative effects on streamflow have occurred fig 3b compared with the third period of 1951 1980 the average difference of streamflow during the fourth period of 1981 2015 was reduced from 10 51 mm yr 1 to 2 84 mm yr 1 a reduction of 73 this result indicates that the effect of open cut mining on reducing streamflow offsets the impact of underground mining despite the large scale expansion of ulan no 2 underground mining and the commence of ulan no 3 underground mining during this period the shift of the dmc in 1981 2015 further demonstrates that open cut mining reduces the impact of underground mining on streamflow in the goulburn river catchment fig 4 the dmc slope did not continue to increase due to the augmentation of underground mining operations but a trend of the dmc slope to decrease appeared when overlapping the influence of open cut mining the dmc slope decreased from 0 033 in 1951 1980 to 0 027 in 1981 2015 3 3 separation of the effects of climate and coal mining on streamflow changes the anthropogenic effects on streamflow were mainly caused by the changes of coal mining activities in the goulburn river catchment the effects of climatic variability and mining activity on streamflow in the goulburn river catchment were shown in table 2 the differences between the observed annual streamflow and the predicted are attributed to coal mining activity disturbances the results based on simhyd modeling indicate that for the change of streamflow climate changes contributed 79 and mining activities contributed 21 during the period of 1921 1950 when ulan no 1 underground mine supplied coals to local markets on a small scale in 1951 1980 the change of streamflow was mainly caused by ulan no 2 underground mining activities and that contributed 57 while climate change contributed only 43 the contribution of mining activities to streamflow decreased to 12 in the latest stage of 1981 2015 when a combined impact existed with underground mining increasing streamflow but open cut mining decreasing it the deviations in the dmc slopes are the effects of mining disturbance on annual streamflow in the goulburn river catchment the results based on the dmc method show that the contribution to streamflow changes caused by mining activities were 16 in 1921 1950 slightly lower than the simulations 21 similarly the contribution of underground mining activities to streamflow increased to 36 in 1951 1980 then in the latest period of 1981 2015 the combined contribution of open cut mining and underground mining to streamflow changes is 22 for the budyko based method climate variability contributed 44 to the changes of annual streamflow and underground mining activities contributed 56 in 1921 1950 the change of streamflow in 1951 1980 was mainly caused by underground mining activities and that contributed 64 while climate change contributed only 36 during the last period of 1981 2015 the contribution of mining activities to streamflow decreased to 54 4 discussion 4 1 the underlying mechanism of mining impact on streamflow coal mining activities can have severe and long term impacts on catchment hydrological process and stream ecosystems harding and boothroyd 2004 miller 2013 sengupta 2018 however mining related evidence is limited in the response of hydrologic mechanism due to lack of consistent long term scale appropriate gauged watersheds miller and zegre 2016 it is challenging to conduct research in a heavily disturbed and changing environment to isolate the hydrological impacts of overlapping mining activities in the goulburn river catchment more than 100 years of hydrological observation records and 90 years of coal mining history provide favourable conditions to reveal the response mechanism of the mining related hydrological process different mining stages show different hydrological responses our results show that streamflow increased during periods of underground mining and the impacts of underground mining on increased streamflow have been greatly reduced and even become negative when combining with the impacts of expending open cut mining most surface related mining studies found that the mining would reduce stormflows and enhance baseflows than the unmined catchment during large rainfall events grigg and hughes 2018 nippgen et al 2017 previous studies provided some evidences that the increase in baseflow was caused by open cut mining and the increased baseflow was likely caused by the change in overland flow and infiltration associated with landscape changes sun et al 2020 to a certain extent open cut mining has a trapping effect on rainfall and runoff these impacts can be well explored based on paired catchments with similar sizes however finding appropriate catchments is almost impossible considering the landscape characteristics such as the long disturbance history the mosaic of land cover miller and zegre 2016 the effects of open cut mining on streamflow are less well understood both increase and decrease streamflow have been observed dhakate et al 2019 ferrari et al 2009 zhao et al 2017 differential responses of streamflow to surface mining are primarily due to different mining and reclamation practices different scales of disturbance and different disturbance histories underground mining drastically alters the subsurface structure and increases hydrologic connectivity that efficiently connect groundwater to surface streams booth 2007 tomlinson and boulton 2010 substantial volumes of water can be transferred between adjacent catchments and between surface and underground that can diminish or exacerbate surface mining driven changes in hydrology brunke and gonser 1997 renard and allard 2013 previous studies focused on changes in hydrological processes impacted by mining activities during rainstorm and flood events ignoring the impact of dewatering on hydrological process during long term mining activities the bioregional assessment program confirmed that coal resource developments affect groundwater hydrology as a result of aquifer depressurisation from mine dewatering and changes to the subsurface physical flow paths such as hydraulic enhancement above longwall mines herron et al 2018 large groundwater abstraction has also caused substantial drop in groundwater level and aquifer dewatering in the hunter river catchment peeters et al 2017 where the long term decline in water levels was related to over pumping of groundwater and reduction in recharge entering the aquifer system owing to over a century old coal mining activity groundwater in this region was under stress from over pumping to sustain the underground mining operation results from the bioregional assessment program show that the cumulative groundwater drawdowns of greater than 0 2 5 m is very likely due to coal resource development in the future herron et al 2018 dewatering activity to sustain the underground mining operations and the pumped water discharged into the stream river after treatment maybe have a great impact on the catchment hydrological process pumping appears to be an important reason for the increase in streamflow during the period of underground mining in the goulburn river catchment it is likely to be the main reason for the increase in streamflow relating to the intensity of over pumping to sustain the underground mining 4 2 uncertainty in contribution analysis quantifying the contributions of climate change and human activities to the streamflow changes is an important issue in hydrology liang et al 2015 wang et al 2012 process based modelling and data driven approaches are two different types of methods to estimate the contribution of climate change and human activities on catchment hydrological processes the process based method uses physically hydrological model to separate the contribution of climate variability to streamflow changes by varying the meteorological inputs for fixed model parameters based on reference period wang et al 2013 xu et al 2014 process based method can reproduce natural streamflow processes without human influence data driven approach estimates the streamflow using statistical regression or nonparametric estimation to separate the relative contributions of climate change and human activities fu et al 2007 seyoum et al 2015 climate changes and human activities are considered as the key factors affecting hydrological processes and are applied to assess their impacts on catchment streamflow in addition to the direct impact of climate changes mining activities are the most important factor affecting the hydrological process in the goulburn river catchment the catchment is largely unregulated i e without subject to dam regulation and large scale ecological restoration the bioregional assessment programme and mining operation plans provide details on the ecology hydrology geology and coal mining development which indicate coal mining is the main anthropogenic factor affecting streamflow changes in the goulburn river catchment herron et al 2018 three approaches including the simhyd model budyko based and dmc approaches were conducted to separate the relative contributions of climate change and mining activities on catchment streamflow as can be seen relative contributions obtained from the three approaches are noticeably different especially for the budyko framework the fractional contribution of climate changes based on budyko framework includes the impact of pet which may be an important reason for their large differences furthermore the budyko based method had limited performance in differentiating the influencing factors for streamflow changes liang et al 2015 liu et al 2017 the variability of climate changes could increase the error in the fractional contribution when evaluated by budyko based model liu et al 2017 variation in annual average precipitation of 10 mm can cause a 0 5 5 in error in the precipitation induced contribution to streamflow changes and when the variation reached 50 mm the error increased to 2 5 25 yang et al 2014a estimation using elasticity coefficients based on the hypothesis that influences from climate change and human activates are independent however the underlying mechanism may be more complex due to the interactions among climate vegetation soil conditions human activates and hydrological processes in different catchments this complex interaction has created a great uncertainty in separating the effects of climate change and human activities on hydrological processes even in the same catchment there were considerable differences in the contribution rates of climate variation and human activates in the previous studies liu et al 2017 there exists a potential error when the climate elasticity was estimated as a first order approximation the first order taylor expansion yang et al 2014b comparing the results of our studies we found that the major causes for the changes of streamflow in the goulburn river catchment were consistent though there existed noticeable relative contribution ratios in different mining periods the different rates of estimated contributions indicate that there is still lots of uncertainty to quantify climate change and mining activities impact on the streamflow and more studies are required 5 conclusions in the study process based modelling and data driven approaches were used to assess streamflow changes related to coal mining and to quantify the contributions of climate variability and mining activities on the streamflow changes in the goulburn river catchment based on history of mining operation and the break changes of streamflow the centennial period of streamflow process from 1913 to 2015 was divided into four sub periods then the streamflow changes associated with underground mining and open cut mining have been quantified using the simhyd model budyko based and dmc approaches this study found that there existed noticeable streamflow increments during the periods of underground mining in the goulburn river catchment which is very likely because of over pumping to sustain the underground mining furthermore there is a certain correlation between the increase in streamflow and the intensity of underground mining the third period the effect of underground mining on streamflow is greatly reduced when superimposed open cut mining activities contributions in different mining periods are determined by the catchment climate and mining operations the climate coal mining hydrology interaction is considered in separation of the relative contribution based on the simhyd model budyko based and dmc approaches the results from the three approaches are consistent in trends during different mining periods but noticeably different in relative contribution ratios indicating the large uncertainty among them how to reduce the uncertainty of quantifying mining impact on streamflow becomes an open question for hydrologists to investigate in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

5537,exchange fluxes occur when hydrological processes transfer water across the topographic surface between the groundwater and surface water systems many hydrological models are capable of estimating exchange fluxes at point scales however as models including integrated hydrological models are upscaled to encompass larger areas using non point scale discretizations the accuracy of hydrological process estimation declines such that the results can become empirical through analyses of topographic indices e g slope roughness wetness index hydraulic heads and surface water groundwater exchange fluxes at multiple horizontal spatial scales this study indicates that it is possible to identify the scale dependencies and inherent empiricism in shallow groundwater hydrological models which contribute to variations in exchange flux estimates and hence groundwater recharge discharge rates at different spatial scales by identifying the scale dependencies and empiricism related to horizontal spatial scale choice it should be possible to improve conceptual design choices when attempting to simulate locations with shallow water tables this is important as a better understanding of the spatial variability of exchange fluxes will allow for better predictions of some catchment behaviours the characterization of the models in this study are a reasonable approximation of a canadian shield site based upon field collected parameters an analysis of the impact of model discretization scale on exchange fluxes and specifically recharge should be a component of all model studies keywords recharge groundwater surface water exchange fluxes scale topography 1 introduction exchange fluxes result from hydrological processes that transfer mass or energy between hydrologic systems e g groundwater surface water atmosphere for the context of this paper exchange fluxes occur when processes transfer mass i e water between the surface water and groundwater systems water that crosses the phreatic surface i e the moving water table below which fully saturated conditions exist from a non saturated location is considered recharge lerner et al 1990 water crossing the topographic surface into the subsurface may be considered infiltration or recharge depending on where the phreatic surface lies in relation to the topographic surface when the phreatic surface is connected to the topographic surface water crossing the phreatic surface from the saturated zone and hence the topographic surface is considered discharge sophocleous 2002 integrated hydrological models are capable of simulating all surface and subsurface hydrological processes and their dynamic interactions sebben et al 2012 this coupling of surface and subsurface models also allows for the simulation of the exchange of water between the two models sebben et al 2012 however an often complicating factor of using integrated hydrological models is that estimates of these exchange fluxes e g recharge discharge at non point scales do not match estimates of exchange fluxes at a point as delin et al 2007 found when examining recharge rates at multiple spatial scales without an explanation of why this seeming misfit is appropriate the difference in exchange flux values may cause difficulty in having a model readily accepted while regional scale modelling has become very popular there have been few papers that explain the misfit caused by the scale of discretization the use of water balance methods can easily estimate recharge fluxes at a point using empirical models finch 1998 chen et al 2005 lee et al 2006 johnson 2012 however the point values of these exchange fluxes may not be appropriate for discretized i e not lumped spatial systems barthel 2014 these systems depending on the characteristics of their shallow subsurface environment may result in hydrologic process behaviour such as groundwater recharge and discharge occurring within a single grid block of the discretized system such that only the scale dependent net flux point recharge minus the groundwater efflux to the surface can be quantified when point exchange fluxes are considered each point is generally considered either recharge or discharge but where the exchange fluxes occur over an area both processes may occur within the same cell as such upscaling of the point exchange flux estimates to accommodate the size of the elements or grid blocks of the discretized model is required the canadian shield is a complex crystalline rock setting that is of hydrological significance for regional water budgets and is a setting of interest for the siting of a deep geologic repository for nuclear fuel waste nwmo 2012 for crystalline rock settings the water table may be shallow and within several meters of the ground surface stevenson et al 1996 the water table is complex and can intersect the ground surface at multiple points within a cell of even a finely discretized system upscaling of point exchange fluxes for these shallow groundwater systems is thus very important as these fluxes are quickly impacted by surface water processes e g precipitation depression storage overland flow because of this impacts on exchange fluxes that occur due to topographic and model upscaling need to be investigated in a shallow groundwater setting with an emphasis on determining which issues and or processes need to be considered when modelling at non point scale resolutions it is the intention of this work to determine how groundwater surface water exchange fluxes vary with horizontal spatial scale and to develop an understanding of the physical characteristics of topography that may affect exchange flux estimates modelling of a canadian shield environment is conducted using hydrogeosphere hgs a 3 dimensional control volume finite element simulator therrien et al 2010 for a 715 km 2 area spanning the canada and united states border between ontario and minnesota the site was modelled using multiple steady state groundwater models to analyze how topographic indices hydraulic head and exchange fluxes are related horizontal spatial resolution for the site digital elevation models varies from point scale i e 1 m to catchment scale i e 10000 m resampling blöschl and sivapalan 1995 natural resources canada 2017 u s geological survey 2017 of the dem at different horizontal resolutions is used to define the top of the groundwater models no field data on exchange fluxes or head values were available to constrain these models however the parameters used to characterize them were chosen based on field measured parameters e g hydraulic conductivity porosity these models can then be used to understand how exchange flux estimates should be interpreted when model grid resolutions are coarsened this understanding may aid in future model conceptualization and validation so as to increase confidence in model use when estimating or applying exchange fluxes at non point scales for example as resolution coarsens it may be necessary to account for additional influences to the movement of water both vertically and horizontally that would not need to be done at finer resolutions this accounting should be an important part of all model studies 2 background hydrologic simulations can be used to represent surface and subsurface environments in order to expand the understanding of process e g infiltration evapotranspiration behaviour when water crosses the groundwater surface water interface it is often referred to as an exchange flux snowdon and craig 2015 exchange fluxes may occur due to multiple hydrological processes e g infiltration recharge discharge evapotranspiration for this study recharge and discharge are the hydrological processes of interest recharge is the movement of water in a downward direction that reaches the water table and adds to groundwater storage lerner et al 1990 de vries and simmers 2002 it can be described as diffuse or focused lerner et al 1990 de vries and simmers 2002 healy 2010 diffuse recharge is considered to be due to precipitation that infiltrates into the subsurface and moves through the unsaturated zone until it reaches the water table it is a distributed process that occurs over large areas focused recharge is an addition to the water table from surface water bodies one of these two types is usually dominant depending on the location diffuse recharge is typically dominant in humid regions whereas focused recharge is typically dominant in arid regions de vries and simmers 2002 discharge is the efflux of water from the subsurface to the surface sophocleous 2002 rosenberry and labaugh 2008 it is a common process in areas with topographic lows and locations with shallow water tables such as the canadian shield groundwater flow to the surface commonly occurs via baseflow and interflow sophocleous 2002 baseflow is a slow flow to surface water features that is continual with only small temporal variations when compared to interflow whereas interflow is a quick response flow that may result from an input event such as a storm if interflow reaches the surface but not a surface water feature it may contribute to overland flow part of the difficulty in estimating exchange fluxes is their variability both temporally and spatially recharge and discharge rates are affected by seasons and long term trends in climate as well as by land use geology and topography sophocleous 2002 rushton 2007 jasechko et al 2014 precipitation is highly variable and has a large impact on the amount of recharge in an area jyrkama and sykes 2007 using daily precipitation values instead of averaged monthly or seasonal precipitation values can improve recharge estimates as the dampening effects of long term trends are removed healy 2010 the composition of the land e g land cover land use soil type affects recharge spatially increased soil or rock permeability can allow for increased recharge slight depressions in a flat topography can act as preferential recharge locations delin et al 2000 and downslope areas show increased amounts of infiltration dunne et al 1991 added complexity can also occur when a river is gaining i e discharge from subsurface to river in one reach and losing i e recharge from river to subsurface in the next becker et al 2004 rushton 2007 in the absence of seepage faces and waterbodies discharge can usually be considered to occur in any location where the hydraulic head exceeds the topographic surface because of this the rate of discharge may be easier to determine than the rate of recharge however this will depend on near surface conductance rates these temporal and spatial concerns are particularly challenging when incorporating exchange fluxes into numerical modelling applications as many models are implemented with constant recharge rates jyrkama and sykes 2007 healy 2010 determining appropriate exchange fluxes at the point scale is challenging given how variable these processes can be both in time and space if locations are simulated using steady state groundwater models temporal variability is ignored and spatial variability becomes the priority in estimating exchange fluxes multiple methods are currently employed to estimate exchange fluxes at the point mesoscale and regional scale a common estimation approach uses water budget models finch 1998 arnold and allen 1999 wittenberg and sivapalan 1999 simmons and meyer 2000 burnett et al 2001 chen et al 2005 lee et al 2006 johnson 2012 water budget equations that define the system are determined for a grid block or representative elementary volume healy et al 2007 the residual method where the components of the system are measured or calculated and the remaining mass is considered recharge is also widely used rasmussen and andreasen 1959 scanlon et al 2001 this approach requires an accurate conceptualization of the system and reliable measurements of the surface unsaturated and groundwater processes process rates can be evaluated using several approaches e g rainfall gauges snow pillows pan evaporation equations such as the penman equation and additional physical methods such as tracers can be used to improve measurement confidence kalbus et al 2006 however given that process rates may vary significantly in different settings e g land use geology and weather models must be conceptualized for specific locations if exchange flux estimates are to be considered good approximations i e rates are not universal or scalable using location specific data and a model well suited for the problem helps to minimize uncertainty crystalline rock settings similar to the canadian shield i e composed of granodiorites granites tonalite and gneisses may have a thin soil overburden or be exposed bedrock devito et al 1996 spence and woo 2002 spence and woo 2003 buttle et al 2004 these crystalline settings usually have shallow water tables with a highly impermeable geology in the absence of fractures devito et al 1996 because the water table is shallow the subsurface of a crystalline rock setting may be significantly influenced by evapotranspiration et and groundwater discharge to the surface spence and woo 2003 while et and discharge may be negligible at the point scale estimation their impact may be far greater as spatial resolutions coarsen spence and woo 2003 suggests that the upscaling of canadian shield models to catchment level need to account for cascading behaviour where overland flow will fill nearby subsurface storage deficits as it travels down basin this adds complexity to modelling at larger scales as efflux from a coarse resolution model cell may re infiltrate before it has left the cell laterally many studies have been conducted that estimate exchange fluxes at the local point scale mesoscale and or regional scale motovilov et al 1999 jyrkama et al 2002 wörman et al 2006 batelaan and de smedt 2007 jyrkama and sykes 2007 setegn et al 2008 wondzell et al 2009 assefa and woodbury 2013 awan and ismaeel 2014 rivard et al 2014 maxwell et al 2015 zomlot et al 2015 huet et al 2016 motovilov 2016 however only a few studies have looked at the effects of scale on hydrological processes motovilov et al 1999 krakauer et al 2014 motovilov 2016 with very little work having been done looking at horizontal scale effects on exchange flux estimates delin et al 2007 merz et al 2009 snowdon and craig 2015 this has led to a lack of understanding about how exchange fluxes vary as the spatial scale of interest changes local or point scale exchange flux estimates may be determined through water balance equations provided the components can be determined with some degree of confidence rushton et al 2006 assefa and woodbury 2013 as the spatial resolution is reduced the confidence in these measurements is also reduced this uncertainty is further compounded when the exchange flux estimates for an area are noticeably lower than the point estimates leading one to question the validity of the model delin et al 2007 as noted by sykes et al 2011 large scale models rarely include rivulets rills brooks and ditches the features where much of groundwater discharge occurs understanding exchange flux estimates and developing accurate estimates of fluxes at non point scales is a necessary step to determine how exchange fluxes are affected by terrain and scale buttle et al 2004 while simultaneously building confidence in the numerical modelling of them many applications of groundwater models are concerned with deep groundwater systems e g nuclear waste repositories hydrofracking it is unclear how changes in model spatial scale at the topographic surface particularly with respect to exchange fluxes affect groundwater conditions at depth in the crystalline rock of the canadian shield wörman et al 2006 used a 3 dimensional spectral solution to look at how variations in topography and scale impact flow patterns in the subsurface their study was interested in determining how and to what depths flow nets are affected at different topographic scales for this study mean life expectancy mle at several depths is the chosen performance measure to investigate the impacts of upscaling park et al 2008 mean life expectancy is the average time for an average water particle to reach a discharge point cornaton and perrochet 2006 molson and frind 2012 this may be an important diagnostic metric for investigating horizontal model scale impacts in the subsurface and on exchange fluxes because the variation in horizontal scale may affect travel times to surface 3 methods 3 1 site description the canadian shield covers an area of 8 million square kilometres and extends from nunavut in northern canada south into the northern states of the united states canadian shield rock can range from unfractured to intensely fractured in fractured zones stevenson et al 1996 spence and woo 2002 sykes et al 2009 which can have a large impact on both groundwater and hydrological processes for this initial study into exchange flux relationships in a canadian shield setting the rock mass is modelled using hgs with an equivalent porous media epm i e discrete fracture zones are not considered in the numerical model the canadian shield typically has little to no overburden as a result of glacial scraping during the multiple glacial advance retreats over the last million years mcclenaghan et al 2001 for this study an area spanning the canada us border from ontario into minnesota was selected see fig 1 since it is located on the canadian shield and for which high quality digital elevation models dem were readily available the site covers part of the quetico provincial park in ontario and the kabetogana state forest in minnesota the chosen watershed is 715 km 2 which was delineated using arcgis elevation data i e cdsm lidar from natural resources canada natural resources canada 2017 and the united states geological survey u s geological survey 2017 were combined using arcgis to create a three metre grid cell dem of the study area see fig 2 the three metre dem was used to define the topographic surface in three hgs numerical groundwater models at horizontal grid scales of 10 m 50 m and 250 m using the original 3 m and resampled dems 10 m 50 m 250 m see fig 3 arcgis was used to evaluate terrain indices that may be relevant to exchange fluxes each dem was analyzed to find its slope deng et al 2007 roughness coefficient zhang et al 2016 and wetness index zhang and montgomery 1994 these characteristics are thought to give valuable insight into understanding how changes in spatial resolution may affect exchange fluxes slope in degrees was calculated at each resolution using arcgis s built in spatial analyst tools the roughness coefficient is calculated in arcgis using focal statistics i e mean minimum maximum for each dem and then using the raster calculator a 250 m by 250 m region is used as comparison since this was the coarsest level of discretization implemented during numerical modelling of the crystalline site the wetness index is used to study spatial effects on hydrological processes and to identify hydrological flow paths beven 1997 the wetness index for each dem is calculated by first determining the flow accumulation grid using archydro tools and the slope in arcgis the flow accumulation grid is a raster map which calculates the accumulated inflow into each grid cell 3 2 model design the three models implemented for this study were developed for use in hydrogeosphere therrien et al 2010 the 3 m dem was used to interpolate topographic surfaces for the 10 m 50 m and 250 m models these surfaces act as the uppermost boundary of the models with several partitioned layers beneath them in total each model is comprised of 31 layers that increase in thickness with the thinnest layers near the surface and the thickest at depth equivalent porous media hydraulic conductivity based on earlier work by stevenson et al 1996 ophori and chan 1996 and ophori et al 1996 also varies with depth with the highest values near the surface as shown in table 1 hydraulic conductivities for the epm rock mass are isotropic the models used in this study are composed of 31 discretized layers with 4 zones of hydraulic conductivity applied to these layers for each grid resolution 10 m 50 m and 250 m a steady state groundwater model was created with the model base at an elevation of 1600 masl a zero flux boundary condition exists on the lateral surfaces of the domain and type 1 i e dirichlet hydraulic boundary conditions were applied at the ground surface the water table elevation was specified equal to the topographic elevation with the intent to observe and determine where exchange fluxes cross the groundwater surface water interface as well as their magnitude each steady state model allowed for exchange fluxes across the surface subsurface boundary in each cell to be recorded for analysis no additional sources of mass nor any exchange fluxes other than discharge recharge were applied to the model during the simulations this setup simplified the quantification of the exchange fluxes 3 2 1 model limitations the canadian shield is a complex environment and the ability to replicate this complexity while being capable of quantifying the fluxes of interest is challenging due to this some assumptions were made while designing the models as stated previously no fractures were explicitly modelled this is to say that no discrete fracture network dfn was incorporated into the model however an epm is used to represent the rock mass the epm incorporates the hydraulic properties of the fractures into a single porous medium along with the intact rock mass 3 3 exchange flux analysis following the model runs at each resolution the hydraulic heads and exchange fluxes were post processed every hydraulic head and flux at the topographic surface was extracted from the model output for statistical analysis the hydraulic heads for the 10 m and 50 m domains were each averaged to represent an area the size of the corresponding 250 m cell the exchange fluxes for the 10 m and 50 m domains were post processed to quantify influx efflux the number of cells contributing to each and the sum of the exchange fluxes within an area equivalent to the corresponding 250 m cell to facilitate comparison between models the hydraulic heads of all three simulations were normalized between 0 and 1 using 1 h n h i h min h max h min where h n is the normalized hydraulic head l and h i is the hydraulic head or average hydraulic head in a given 250 m by 250 m area the 250 m by 250 m area is a single cell at the 250 m grid resolution and the averaged 10 m or 50 m grid resolution values for the equivalent 250 m by 250 m area l h min is the minimum hydraulic head in a 250 m by 250 m region l and h max is the maximum hydraulic head in a 250 m by 250 m region l once the model results for the 10 m and 50 m grid models have been post processed to areas matching the 250 m grid model comparisons can be made between the three models the initial interpretation is done by examining the relationship between exchange fluxes versus normalized heads there are over 11000 cells in the 250 m grid which can yield trend information but may not provide a quantitative understanding on the relationships so a selection of cells approximately 500 are used to illustrate any patterns that may exist in the positive and the negative exchange fluxes at the three modelled scales the cell subset was arbitrarily selected and results for all grid blocks show the same trends to quantify the changes apparent as scales coarsen the average positive and negative exchange fluxes for the entire model domain were calculated and plotted from this it is possible to define the relationship that exists between fluxes and spatial scale as well as impacts due to missing topographic details as scale increases further analysis was conducted by examining how many cells from the 10 m and 50 m models within the corresponding 250 m cell area contributed to negative and positive exchange fluxes once an understanding of scale impacts on exchange fluxes was determined it was necessary to examine the relationship between topographic indices and scale it was the expectation that this would help characterize why changes in exchange fluxes were occurring so that it may be possible to predict the impact on exchange fluxes for a given terrain after determining its variability and indices as discussed in this paper 3 4 mean life expectancy the objective of this analysis was to assess the sensitivity of mass transport at depth to the upscaling of the horizontal grid scale in the model domains following the initial hgs simulations at the three dem resolutions a second set of simulations using the 3 original model setups at the 10 m 50 m and 250 m horizontal spatial scales was conducted to compute the mean life expectancy depths of 50 m 100 m 200 m 400 m and 600 m were chosen to compare mle values across the 3 numerical models in the first set of test simulations at each resolution to maintain consistency a longitudinal dispersivity value of 175 m approximately 70 of largest cell length a transverse dispersivity of 17 5 m and a vertical dispersivity of 17 5 m were used the output of the simulations was then mapped and compared to determine if the variation in spatial scale had an impact on mle values in order to examine how changes in dispersivity affect the mle at depth in conjunction with changes in spatial scale a second set of test simulations were run with a longitudinal dispersivity value equal to the cell length i e 10 m 50 m 250 m and a transverse dispersivity and a vertical dispersivity of one tenth of the cell length i e 1 m 5 m 25 m output from these simulations were then mapped and compared to illustrate differences between spatial scales and dispersivity changes 4 results discussion 4 1 topographic indices the initial analysis of the dems used in this study looked at the slope figs 4 and 5 the roughness coefficients fig 6 and the wetness indices fig 7 as can be seen in the figures slope is reduced significantly when cell sizes coarsen from 3 m to 10 m additional reductions occur as the horizontal scale coarsens to 50 m and 250 m the 250 m dem is relatively flat with little variability visible this is expected as smoothing would result with resampling the dems resampling was done using arcgis by using the nearest neighbour method to determine the upscaled grid elevation value a clearer representation of the change in slope as dems coarsen is apparent in fig 5 which shows how the slope reduces to a narrow range and a shift towards smaller slopes as cell size coarsens to the 250 m grid size similar to the dem slope terrain roughness decreases as grid resolution coarsens with each subsequent coarsening the terrain roughness coefficient fig 6 decreases until at the 250 m dem it is largely a uniform low coefficient this can be attributed to smoothing as was seen with the changes in slope with dem coarsening in the figures multiple white spaces may be seen where waterbodies are located contrary to the slope and roughness coefficient the wetness index fig 7 experiences the opposite effect during resolution coarsening in the figures multiple white spaces may be seen where waterbodies are located at the finer resolutions the wetness index increases with a decrease in spatial resolution this is intuitively correct because the wetness index is expected to be large in flat areas and as has been shown with slope and the roughness coefficient the topography is getting progressively flatter as scale coarsens this may have an impact on simulated hydrological processes as more water is available at the topographic surface 4 2 exchange fluxes and hydraulic head after the hgs models have been run and the output i e heads exchange fluxes has been extracted and post processed it is possible to compare and to begin identifying relationships that exist between exchange fluxes and normalized hydraulic head fig 8 shows a plot of the fluxes from the 10 m 50 m and 250 m cells in equivalent 250 m cell areas i e one 250 m cell twenty five 50 m cells six hundred and twenty five 10 m cells plotted against normalized head as can be seen there are positive and negative exchange fluxes with negative fluxes predominantly in the 0 to 0 5 normalized head range and positive fluxes predominantly in the 0 5 to 1 normalized head range given that discharge zones typically exist in topographic lows and topographic highs are often associated with recharge zones it is logical that the model output shows that the lower topographic elevations have efflux rather than influx and higher elevations have influx over efflux the trend is most apparent by looking at the data points for the 250 m cells green data points a point of interest from this plot is that the range of normalized heads appears to reduce with finer spatial scales while the magnitude of the exchange fluxes is larger at finer spatial resolutions this is a potentially useful finding as it supports the theory that exchange flux magnitude may be muted at coarser scales which may be caused by recharge entering a cell and then discharging from the same cell if the water entering a large cell exits vertically before being transported laterally to another cell then it follows that exchange flux estimates could be dramatically different than in a smaller cell it is more difficult to extract a relationship of the positive and negative fluxes at finer resolutions but given that the fluxes are larger it may be possible to infer that the lateral transfer of water between cells is an important factor since the larger fluxes may imply that water that enters a cell via recharge then leaves a cell laterally before exiting via discharge through the groundwater surface water interface in another grid cell as grid cells increase in size the assumption is that lateral flow will be less likely to transport mass beyond the current cell boundary and hence this phenomena will become more apparent with increased cell size therefore the exchange flux from a smaller cell size may only reflect influx or efflux but not necessarily both 4 3 topographic scale as an initial assessment of how exchange fluxes vary with spatial scale the net exchange fluxes at equivalent 250 m grid scales were compared at the three horizontal spatial scales fig 9 shows that when the spatial scale changes and the exchange flux is compared at an equivalent area there are only small changes in magnitude the grey lines show individual location comparisons with the mean indicated in red this is intuitive as the net exchange fluxes for the same areal coverage should be similar however the magnitude of the positive and negative fluxes are not explicitly indicated here this may confirm that coarse cells are capturing both influx and efflux occurring within the same cell before lateral transport occurs unlike exchange flux estimates in the smaller cells to disseminate how the positive and negative aspects of the exchange fluxes are impacted at various spatial scales it is necessary to separate them from the net flux rate and analyze them at the various spatial scales they can then be plotted against their spatial scale to see if patterns emerge as can be seen in fig 10 when approximately 500 positive and 500 negative exchange fluxes from the same 250 m by 250 m areas are plotted at each scale a power law relationship emerges it can be easily seen that every 250 m grid cell equivalent yields a similar power law curve while these plots only show a small subset of the total data i e 11262 250 m cells and quickly become cluttered it provides insight into how exchange fluxes are affected by changes in spatial scale and the trend that exists as scales change to extract a relationship for the entire domain that is clearer the mean positive and mean negative exchange flux rates at each spatial scale were calculated fig 11 a shows this with a power law trend line it is clear that the influx and efflux rates at multiple scales follow a power law trend to prove this the same data was plotted on a log log plot see fig 11b the curve becomes a straight line confirming the power law relationship as was shown in beven 1984 selker et al 1999 rupp and selker 2005 cardenas 2008 troch et al 2008 harman et al 2009 snowdon and craig 2015 many hydrological processes can be represented using power laws the importance of this information for this study is that for the shallow water table systems investigated in this study the exchange fluxes are higher at finer scales and lower at coarse scales regardless of the type of flux larger amounts of influx and efflux occur in the same area when a terrain has a coarser discretization further supporting the idea that at coarser resolutions the vertical movement of water into and out of a single cell occurs prior to its movement laterally out of the cell but in finer resolutions water may move into or out of the cell laterally before it is moved vertically subsequent times hence lateral transport between cells has a larger impact on finer resolutions than on coarser ones specifically when looking at the vertical movement of water across the topographic surface to demonstrate how much influx and efflux occurs within a 250 m equivalent area the mean number of cells contributing to positive and negative exchange fluxes were calculated fig 12 a shows the percent of cells for the entire domain based on 250 m equivalent areas it shows that the change in the number of contributing cells follows a power law relationship as spatial scale changes this is confirmed through the log log plot of the data see fig 12b interestingly there is an increase in the area contributing to positive exchange fluxes as the scale coarsens that fits with expectations given that the topographic surface is flatter however the change in contributing area to both positive and negative fluxes only changes by approximately 3 approximately 350 cells out of 11 262 of the 250 m total cells 4 4 mean life expectancy because mean life expectancy quantifies the mean travel time for an average water particle to reach a discharge point i e ground surface it is possible to use the mle to examine how changes in horizontal scale may affect groundwater system behaviour at depth for constant dispersivity figs 13 and 14 present the ratio of log10 mle values for the 50 m and 250 m grid resolutions respectively compared to the 10 m grid resolution values greater than unity shown in red indicate that the mle value is greater for the 50 m or 250 m grid resolutions than the 10 m grid resolution values less than unity shown in blue indicate the opposite when looking at the 50 10 and 250 10 mle ratios at shallow depths 50 m depth shown in figs 13a and 14a it can be seen that the 50 m scale mles are greater than the 10 m scale mles this also occurs in both ratios at the 100 m depth figs 13b and 14b at depths of 200 m 400 m and 600 m the 50 10 mle ratios are nearly unity fig 13 the majority of visible differences disappear once the 200 m depth fig 13c e is reached indicating that for similar dispersivities larger than the grid resolution mle values at the 10 m and 50 m scales are similar small differences exist but they are not visible in the figure at depths below 200 m the 250 10 mle ratios see fig 14 decrease toward unity as depth increases the mle ratios approach unity although more slowly than in the 50 10 mle ratio case in the 250 10 mle ratios some mle values are smaller at the 250 m scale than the 10 m scale although the majority are higher when the dispersivities are adjusted in each simulation to match the cell lengths of their respective models see figs 15 and 16 there is a noticeable change the 50 10 mle ratio appears to have equal amounts of ratios above and below unity for 50 m depth fig 15a whereas the 250 m scale mles are generally larger than the 10 m scale mles at 50 m depth fig 16a as depth increases the ratios reduce however there is a clear difference visible at every depth unlike in the 50 10 mle ratio figures for the mles with matching dispersivities fig 13 the 50 10 mle ratio for dispersivities matching cell length shows less variation and extremes from unity than the 250 10 ratio which has more positive mle ratio values indicating higher mles at the 250 m scale as compared to the 10 m scale it is apparent that the groundwater system at various depths and hence the mles at the 10 m and 50 m scale are closer in value than the 10 m and 250 m mle values in fact a much larger disparity is visible in all 250 10 mle ratio figures as compared to the 50 10 mle ratio figures given that it is common to use a dispersivity that is limited by a cell s length the calculated mles for coarser scales are greater due primarily to reduced hydraulic gradients and hence reduced advective velocities this results in longer average water particle travel times and greater mle values than at finer resolutions 4 5 physical parameters and scale having established that exchange fluxes vary with spatial scale and that finer resolutions appear to have larger exchange fluxes with a smaller normalized head range figs 11 and 12 it would be appropriate to look at possible physical explanations for these effects it is suspected that terrain indices may in part indicate how exchange fluxes are impacted by scale changes fig 17 shows the terrain slope statistics at multiple spatial scales the maximum slope quickly decreases as the slope becomes flatter mean slope and standard deviation also decreases but not as significantly as the maximum the minimum slope value is equal to zero at all horizontal scales the terrain roughness coefficient does not show quick or large changes with spatial scale variation fig 18 the mean decreases slightly but the most prominent change occurs between the 50 m and 250 m scales there is a pronounced difference in the maximum roughness coefficient the minimum is no longer zero the only spatial scale without a zero minimum and the standard deviation drops lower than the 3 m scale this may indicate that terrain roughness is not a significant index for relating exchange fluxes to spatial scale the last terrain index examined is the wetness index fig 19 shows the wetness indices at every spatial scale the minimum mean and maximum wetness indices show a general increase as scale coarsens with the exception of the 250 m maximum value this fits with earlier expectations of flatter terrains having a larger wetness index and would indicate that coarser resolutions are more susceptible to saturated topographic surfaces and more prone to losses through ill defined aspects of overland flow such as rivulets rills and ditches at larger scales or possibly discharge through the topographic surface 4 6 implications if exchange fluxes at the point scale can be considered physically accurate and true then it would seem an appropriate assumption that exchange flux estimates at ever coarsening scales given the noticed differences shown in this paper are empirical and scale dependent the implication being that exchange fluxes cannot be simulated at multiple scales using the same methods they are not a fixed value except at the point scale as any integration results in a reduction of the flux rate the primary goal of this work was to assess how exchange fluxes were affected by horizontal spatial scale in a shallow water table system of the canadian shield the use of mle simulations provided additional insights on the impact of horizontal scale on the groundwater system of the canadian shield this study raises a new concern for locations that are in shallow water table crystalline rock settings and indicates that the modelling of the surface shallow groundwater and potentially the deep groundwater system need to be treated as scale dependent if a coarse scale is used in simulations the magnitude and distribution of the exchange fluxes may not be representative of the point scale estimates this would be of concern if the purpose of the simulation were to model solute transport the mle simulations indicate that as spatial scale coarsens changes in the subsurface may not be adequately represented characterization choices such as dispersivity values must be justified to assess the impact they have on the behaviour of the subsurface in regional models little can be inferred about how to mitigate this situation other than the use of finer resolution grids when attempting to determine mle at depth as to what scale is appropriate that would need to be determined on a case by case basis for an individual site based on the physics and the impacts on simulated results however as this study has shown the results when using a 50 m grid can provide similar results to the 10 m grid even though it is 25 times smaller the 250 m grid may be too coarse as the results have been clearly shown to deviate from the 10 m grid results while this work is suggesting that every model grid size should be determined for an individual site it appears at least for this site that the use of a 50 m grid may provide an acceptable compromise between model size and capturing system behaviour 5 conclusion the purpose of this paper was to determine how changes in horizontal spatial scales in hydrological models affect groundwater surface water exchange fluxes it is possible to see that as spatial scales coarsen the net exchange fluxes are less than the point scale estimates at the finer resolutions this trend is consistent across the entire canadian shield site modelled in this study determining why this occurs involved looking at terrain indices and exchange fluxes in order to quantify how these indices and exchange fluxes are impacted by spatial scales understanding how models represent a physical location at various horizontal spatial scales and how this affects exchange fluxes should be included in the justification and explanation of upscaled regional modelling results at this point little conclusive evidence exists to indicate how terrain indices can be used to predict model results when using upscaled regional models however this paper provides a needed explanation of why point scale processes are not captured in discretized models it has been confirmed that exchange fluxes are scale dependent and hence empirical for groundwater systems exchange flux magnitudes are sensitive and proportional to both the hydraulic conductivity of the shallow bedrock and the hydraulic gradient which also adds to the empiricism of the exchange fluxes given these dependencies and the strong empiricism in shallow groundwater system models any modelling at non point scales becomes subject to increased uncertainty this uncertainty means that the magnitude and distribution of exchange fluxes cannot be predicted prior to simulations making the ideal choice of horizontal spatial scale for a location difficult to choose as was discussed in the implications section following this research it appears that for this site it could be possible to use a 50 m grid scale as the results are similar to the 10 m grid scale however the 250 m grid scale results deviate significantly from the other two which makes it not an ideal choice this paper investigated fluid transfer and mle but the implications could include other mass transport scenarios as grid block sizes increase a larger amount of dispersion numerical and due to larger dispersivities will occur resulting in greater spreading of solutes hydraulic gradients and thus fluid advective velocities are reduced thereby enhancing solute travel times and increasing mle values an extension of this would be to conclude that if the objective of an analysis is the estimation of contaminant migration to a discharge point from a source at depth in a rock mass the result will be sensitive to the scale of the modelling in almost every scenario that was tested however at this time few conclusions can be made regarding scale dependencies in deep groundwater systems as they are beyond the scope of this paper the scale dependency of exchange fluxes is also expected to occur in integrated surface water groundwater models and it must be recognized that integrated models would not solve the problem of scale dependency if a model is upscaled from the point scale exchange flux estimates will be affected most likely due to loss of the sub grid details e g topography slope that are not characterized in the upscaled model this means that when upscaled or regional models are used it becomes necessary for the researchers to comment on the scale of the grid and to explain the impact of the scale choice on the upscaled exchange fluxes credit authorship contribution statement

5537,exchange fluxes occur when hydrological processes transfer water across the topographic surface between the groundwater and surface water systems many hydrological models are capable of estimating exchange fluxes at point scales however as models including integrated hydrological models are upscaled to encompass larger areas using non point scale discretizations the accuracy of hydrological process estimation declines such that the results can become empirical through analyses of topographic indices e g slope roughness wetness index hydraulic heads and surface water groundwater exchange fluxes at multiple horizontal spatial scales this study indicates that it is possible to identify the scale dependencies and inherent empiricism in shallow groundwater hydrological models which contribute to variations in exchange flux estimates and hence groundwater recharge discharge rates at different spatial scales by identifying the scale dependencies and empiricism related to horizontal spatial scale choice it should be possible to improve conceptual design choices when attempting to simulate locations with shallow water tables this is important as a better understanding of the spatial variability of exchange fluxes will allow for better predictions of some catchment behaviours the characterization of the models in this study are a reasonable approximation of a canadian shield site based upon field collected parameters an analysis of the impact of model discretization scale on exchange fluxes and specifically recharge should be a component of all model studies keywords recharge groundwater surface water exchange fluxes scale topography 1 introduction exchange fluxes result from hydrological processes that transfer mass or energy between hydrologic systems e g groundwater surface water atmosphere for the context of this paper exchange fluxes occur when processes transfer mass i e water between the surface water and groundwater systems water that crosses the phreatic surface i e the moving water table below which fully saturated conditions exist from a non saturated location is considered recharge lerner et al 1990 water crossing the topographic surface into the subsurface may be considered infiltration or recharge depending on where the phreatic surface lies in relation to the topographic surface when the phreatic surface is connected to the topographic surface water crossing the phreatic surface from the saturated zone and hence the topographic surface is considered discharge sophocleous 2002 integrated hydrological models are capable of simulating all surface and subsurface hydrological processes and their dynamic interactions sebben et al 2012 this coupling of surface and subsurface models also allows for the simulation of the exchange of water between the two models sebben et al 2012 however an often complicating factor of using integrated hydrological models is that estimates of these exchange fluxes e g recharge discharge at non point scales do not match estimates of exchange fluxes at a point as delin et al 2007 found when examining recharge rates at multiple spatial scales without an explanation of why this seeming misfit is appropriate the difference in exchange flux values may cause difficulty in having a model readily accepted while regional scale modelling has become very popular there have been few papers that explain the misfit caused by the scale of discretization the use of water balance methods can easily estimate recharge fluxes at a point using empirical models finch 1998 chen et al 2005 lee et al 2006 johnson 2012 however the point values of these exchange fluxes may not be appropriate for discretized i e not lumped spatial systems barthel 2014 these systems depending on the characteristics of their shallow subsurface environment may result in hydrologic process behaviour such as groundwater recharge and discharge occurring within a single grid block of the discretized system such that only the scale dependent net flux point recharge minus the groundwater efflux to the surface can be quantified when point exchange fluxes are considered each point is generally considered either recharge or discharge but where the exchange fluxes occur over an area both processes may occur within the same cell as such upscaling of the point exchange flux estimates to accommodate the size of the elements or grid blocks of the discretized model is required the canadian shield is a complex crystalline rock setting that is of hydrological significance for regional water budgets and is a setting of interest for the siting of a deep geologic repository for nuclear fuel waste nwmo 2012 for crystalline rock settings the water table may be shallow and within several meters of the ground surface stevenson et al 1996 the water table is complex and can intersect the ground surface at multiple points within a cell of even a finely discretized system upscaling of point exchange fluxes for these shallow groundwater systems is thus very important as these fluxes are quickly impacted by surface water processes e g precipitation depression storage overland flow because of this impacts on exchange fluxes that occur due to topographic and model upscaling need to be investigated in a shallow groundwater setting with an emphasis on determining which issues and or processes need to be considered when modelling at non point scale resolutions it is the intention of this work to determine how groundwater surface water exchange fluxes vary with horizontal spatial scale and to develop an understanding of the physical characteristics of topography that may affect exchange flux estimates modelling of a canadian shield environment is conducted using hydrogeosphere hgs a 3 dimensional control volume finite element simulator therrien et al 2010 for a 715 km 2 area spanning the canada and united states border between ontario and minnesota the site was modelled using multiple steady state groundwater models to analyze how topographic indices hydraulic head and exchange fluxes are related horizontal spatial resolution for the site digital elevation models varies from point scale i e 1 m to catchment scale i e 10000 m resampling blöschl and sivapalan 1995 natural resources canada 2017 u s geological survey 2017 of the dem at different horizontal resolutions is used to define the top of the groundwater models no field data on exchange fluxes or head values were available to constrain these models however the parameters used to characterize them were chosen based on field measured parameters e g hydraulic conductivity porosity these models can then be used to understand how exchange flux estimates should be interpreted when model grid resolutions are coarsened this understanding may aid in future model conceptualization and validation so as to increase confidence in model use when estimating or applying exchange fluxes at non point scales for example as resolution coarsens it may be necessary to account for additional influences to the movement of water both vertically and horizontally that would not need to be done at finer resolutions this accounting should be an important part of all model studies 2 background hydrologic simulations can be used to represent surface and subsurface environments in order to expand the understanding of process e g infiltration evapotranspiration behaviour when water crosses the groundwater surface water interface it is often referred to as an exchange flux snowdon and craig 2015 exchange fluxes may occur due to multiple hydrological processes e g infiltration recharge discharge evapotranspiration for this study recharge and discharge are the hydrological processes of interest recharge is the movement of water in a downward direction that reaches the water table and adds to groundwater storage lerner et al 1990 de vries and simmers 2002 it can be described as diffuse or focused lerner et al 1990 de vries and simmers 2002 healy 2010 diffuse recharge is considered to be due to precipitation that infiltrates into the subsurface and moves through the unsaturated zone until it reaches the water table it is a distributed process that occurs over large areas focused recharge is an addition to the water table from surface water bodies one of these two types is usually dominant depending on the location diffuse recharge is typically dominant in humid regions whereas focused recharge is typically dominant in arid regions de vries and simmers 2002 discharge is the efflux of water from the subsurface to the surface sophocleous 2002 rosenberry and labaugh 2008 it is a common process in areas with topographic lows and locations with shallow water tables such as the canadian shield groundwater flow to the surface commonly occurs via baseflow and interflow sophocleous 2002 baseflow is a slow flow to surface water features that is continual with only small temporal variations when compared to interflow whereas interflow is a quick response flow that may result from an input event such as a storm if interflow reaches the surface but not a surface water feature it may contribute to overland flow part of the difficulty in estimating exchange fluxes is their variability both temporally and spatially recharge and discharge rates are affected by seasons and long term trends in climate as well as by land use geology and topography sophocleous 2002 rushton 2007 jasechko et al 2014 precipitation is highly variable and has a large impact on the amount of recharge in an area jyrkama and sykes 2007 using daily precipitation values instead of averaged monthly or seasonal precipitation values can improve recharge estimates as the dampening effects of long term trends are removed healy 2010 the composition of the land e g land cover land use soil type affects recharge spatially increased soil or rock permeability can allow for increased recharge slight depressions in a flat topography can act as preferential recharge locations delin et al 2000 and downslope areas show increased amounts of infiltration dunne et al 1991 added complexity can also occur when a river is gaining i e discharge from subsurface to river in one reach and losing i e recharge from river to subsurface in the next becker et al 2004 rushton 2007 in the absence of seepage faces and waterbodies discharge can usually be considered to occur in any location where the hydraulic head exceeds the topographic surface because of this the rate of discharge may be easier to determine than the rate of recharge however this will depend on near surface conductance rates these temporal and spatial concerns are particularly challenging when incorporating exchange fluxes into numerical modelling applications as many models are implemented with constant recharge rates jyrkama and sykes 2007 healy 2010 determining appropriate exchange fluxes at the point scale is challenging given how variable these processes can be both in time and space if locations are simulated using steady state groundwater models temporal variability is ignored and spatial variability becomes the priority in estimating exchange fluxes multiple methods are currently employed to estimate exchange fluxes at the point mesoscale and regional scale a common estimation approach uses water budget models finch 1998 arnold and allen 1999 wittenberg and sivapalan 1999 simmons and meyer 2000 burnett et al 2001 chen et al 2005 lee et al 2006 johnson 2012 water budget equations that define the system are determined for a grid block or representative elementary volume healy et al 2007 the residual method where the components of the system are measured or calculated and the remaining mass is considered recharge is also widely used rasmussen and andreasen 1959 scanlon et al 2001 this approach requires an accurate conceptualization of the system and reliable measurements of the surface unsaturated and groundwater processes process rates can be evaluated using several approaches e g rainfall gauges snow pillows pan evaporation equations such as the penman equation and additional physical methods such as tracers can be used to improve measurement confidence kalbus et al 2006 however given that process rates may vary significantly in different settings e g land use geology and weather models must be conceptualized for specific locations if exchange flux estimates are to be considered good approximations i e rates are not universal or scalable using location specific data and a model well suited for the problem helps to minimize uncertainty crystalline rock settings similar to the canadian shield i e composed of granodiorites granites tonalite and gneisses may have a thin soil overburden or be exposed bedrock devito et al 1996 spence and woo 2002 spence and woo 2003 buttle et al 2004 these crystalline settings usually have shallow water tables with a highly impermeable geology in the absence of fractures devito et al 1996 because the water table is shallow the subsurface of a crystalline rock setting may be significantly influenced by evapotranspiration et and groundwater discharge to the surface spence and woo 2003 while et and discharge may be negligible at the point scale estimation their impact may be far greater as spatial resolutions coarsen spence and woo 2003 suggests that the upscaling of canadian shield models to catchment level need to account for cascading behaviour where overland flow will fill nearby subsurface storage deficits as it travels down basin this adds complexity to modelling at larger scales as efflux from a coarse resolution model cell may re infiltrate before it has left the cell laterally many studies have been conducted that estimate exchange fluxes at the local point scale mesoscale and or regional scale motovilov et al 1999 jyrkama et al 2002 wörman et al 2006 batelaan and de smedt 2007 jyrkama and sykes 2007 setegn et al 2008 wondzell et al 2009 assefa and woodbury 2013 awan and ismaeel 2014 rivard et al 2014 maxwell et al 2015 zomlot et al 2015 huet et al 2016 motovilov 2016 however only a few studies have looked at the effects of scale on hydrological processes motovilov et al 1999 krakauer et al 2014 motovilov 2016 with very little work having been done looking at horizontal scale effects on exchange flux estimates delin et al 2007 merz et al 2009 snowdon and craig 2015 this has led to a lack of understanding about how exchange fluxes vary as the spatial scale of interest changes local or point scale exchange flux estimates may be determined through water balance equations provided the components can be determined with some degree of confidence rushton et al 2006 assefa and woodbury 2013 as the spatial resolution is reduced the confidence in these measurements is also reduced this uncertainty is further compounded when the exchange flux estimates for an area are noticeably lower than the point estimates leading one to question the validity of the model delin et al 2007 as noted by sykes et al 2011 large scale models rarely include rivulets rills brooks and ditches the features where much of groundwater discharge occurs understanding exchange flux estimates and developing accurate estimates of fluxes at non point scales is a necessary step to determine how exchange fluxes are affected by terrain and scale buttle et al 2004 while simultaneously building confidence in the numerical modelling of them many applications of groundwater models are concerned with deep groundwater systems e g nuclear waste repositories hydrofracking it is unclear how changes in model spatial scale at the topographic surface particularly with respect to exchange fluxes affect groundwater conditions at depth in the crystalline rock of the canadian shield wörman et al 2006 used a 3 dimensional spectral solution to look at how variations in topography and scale impact flow patterns in the subsurface their study was interested in determining how and to what depths flow nets are affected at different topographic scales for this study mean life expectancy mle at several depths is the chosen performance measure to investigate the impacts of upscaling park et al 2008 mean life expectancy is the average time for an average water particle to reach a discharge point cornaton and perrochet 2006 molson and frind 2012 this may be an important diagnostic metric for investigating horizontal model scale impacts in the subsurface and on exchange fluxes because the variation in horizontal scale may affect travel times to surface 3 methods 3 1 site description the canadian shield covers an area of 8 million square kilometres and extends from nunavut in northern canada south into the northern states of the united states canadian shield rock can range from unfractured to intensely fractured in fractured zones stevenson et al 1996 spence and woo 2002 sykes et al 2009 which can have a large impact on both groundwater and hydrological processes for this initial study into exchange flux relationships in a canadian shield setting the rock mass is modelled using hgs with an equivalent porous media epm i e discrete fracture zones are not considered in the numerical model the canadian shield typically has little to no overburden as a result of glacial scraping during the multiple glacial advance retreats over the last million years mcclenaghan et al 2001 for this study an area spanning the canada us border from ontario into minnesota was selected see fig 1 since it is located on the canadian shield and for which high quality digital elevation models dem were readily available the site covers part of the quetico provincial park in ontario and the kabetogana state forest in minnesota the chosen watershed is 715 km 2 which was delineated using arcgis elevation data i e cdsm lidar from natural resources canada natural resources canada 2017 and the united states geological survey u s geological survey 2017 were combined using arcgis to create a three metre grid cell dem of the study area see fig 2 the three metre dem was used to define the topographic surface in three hgs numerical groundwater models at horizontal grid scales of 10 m 50 m and 250 m using the original 3 m and resampled dems 10 m 50 m 250 m see fig 3 arcgis was used to evaluate terrain indices that may be relevant to exchange fluxes each dem was analyzed to find its slope deng et al 2007 roughness coefficient zhang et al 2016 and wetness index zhang and montgomery 1994 these characteristics are thought to give valuable insight into understanding how changes in spatial resolution may affect exchange fluxes slope in degrees was calculated at each resolution using arcgis s built in spatial analyst tools the roughness coefficient is calculated in arcgis using focal statistics i e mean minimum maximum for each dem and then using the raster calculator a 250 m by 250 m region is used as comparison since this was the coarsest level of discretization implemented during numerical modelling of the crystalline site the wetness index is used to study spatial effects on hydrological processes and to identify hydrological flow paths beven 1997 the wetness index for each dem is calculated by first determining the flow accumulation grid using archydro tools and the slope in arcgis the flow accumulation grid is a raster map which calculates the accumulated inflow into each grid cell 3 2 model design the three models implemented for this study were developed for use in hydrogeosphere therrien et al 2010 the 3 m dem was used to interpolate topographic surfaces for the 10 m 50 m and 250 m models these surfaces act as the uppermost boundary of the models with several partitioned layers beneath them in total each model is comprised of 31 layers that increase in thickness with the thinnest layers near the surface and the thickest at depth equivalent porous media hydraulic conductivity based on earlier work by stevenson et al 1996 ophori and chan 1996 and ophori et al 1996 also varies with depth with the highest values near the surface as shown in table 1 hydraulic conductivities for the epm rock mass are isotropic the models used in this study are composed of 31 discretized layers with 4 zones of hydraulic conductivity applied to these layers for each grid resolution 10 m 50 m and 250 m a steady state groundwater model was created with the model base at an elevation of 1600 masl a zero flux boundary condition exists on the lateral surfaces of the domain and type 1 i e dirichlet hydraulic boundary conditions were applied at the ground surface the water table elevation was specified equal to the topographic elevation with the intent to observe and determine where exchange fluxes cross the groundwater surface water interface as well as their magnitude each steady state model allowed for exchange fluxes across the surface subsurface boundary in each cell to be recorded for analysis no additional sources of mass nor any exchange fluxes other than discharge recharge were applied to the model during the simulations this setup simplified the quantification of the exchange fluxes 3 2 1 model limitations the canadian shield is a complex environment and the ability to replicate this complexity while being capable of quantifying the fluxes of interest is challenging due to this some assumptions were made while designing the models as stated previously no fractures were explicitly modelled this is to say that no discrete fracture network dfn was incorporated into the model however an epm is used to represent the rock mass the epm incorporates the hydraulic properties of the fractures into a single porous medium along with the intact rock mass 3 3 exchange flux analysis following the model runs at each resolution the hydraulic heads and exchange fluxes were post processed every hydraulic head and flux at the topographic surface was extracted from the model output for statistical analysis the hydraulic heads for the 10 m and 50 m domains were each averaged to represent an area the size of the corresponding 250 m cell the exchange fluxes for the 10 m and 50 m domains were post processed to quantify influx efflux the number of cells contributing to each and the sum of the exchange fluxes within an area equivalent to the corresponding 250 m cell to facilitate comparison between models the hydraulic heads of all three simulations were normalized between 0 and 1 using 1 h n h i h min h max h min where h n is the normalized hydraulic head l and h i is the hydraulic head or average hydraulic head in a given 250 m by 250 m area the 250 m by 250 m area is a single cell at the 250 m grid resolution and the averaged 10 m or 50 m grid resolution values for the equivalent 250 m by 250 m area l h min is the minimum hydraulic head in a 250 m by 250 m region l and h max is the maximum hydraulic head in a 250 m by 250 m region l once the model results for the 10 m and 50 m grid models have been post processed to areas matching the 250 m grid model comparisons can be made between the three models the initial interpretation is done by examining the relationship between exchange fluxes versus normalized heads there are over 11000 cells in the 250 m grid which can yield trend information but may not provide a quantitative understanding on the relationships so a selection of cells approximately 500 are used to illustrate any patterns that may exist in the positive and the negative exchange fluxes at the three modelled scales the cell subset was arbitrarily selected and results for all grid blocks show the same trends to quantify the changes apparent as scales coarsen the average positive and negative exchange fluxes for the entire model domain were calculated and plotted from this it is possible to define the relationship that exists between fluxes and spatial scale as well as impacts due to missing topographic details as scale increases further analysis was conducted by examining how many cells from the 10 m and 50 m models within the corresponding 250 m cell area contributed to negative and positive exchange fluxes once an understanding of scale impacts on exchange fluxes was determined it was necessary to examine the relationship between topographic indices and scale it was the expectation that this would help characterize why changes in exchange fluxes were occurring so that it may be possible to predict the impact on exchange fluxes for a given terrain after determining its variability and indices as discussed in this paper 3 4 mean life expectancy the objective of this analysis was to assess the sensitivity of mass transport at depth to the upscaling of the horizontal grid scale in the model domains following the initial hgs simulations at the three dem resolutions a second set of simulations using the 3 original model setups at the 10 m 50 m and 250 m horizontal spatial scales was conducted to compute the mean life expectancy depths of 50 m 100 m 200 m 400 m and 600 m were chosen to compare mle values across the 3 numerical models in the first set of test simulations at each resolution to maintain consistency a longitudinal dispersivity value of 175 m approximately 70 of largest cell length a transverse dispersivity of 17 5 m and a vertical dispersivity of 17 5 m were used the output of the simulations was then mapped and compared to determine if the variation in spatial scale had an impact on mle values in order to examine how changes in dispersivity affect the mle at depth in conjunction with changes in spatial scale a second set of test simulations were run with a longitudinal dispersivity value equal to the cell length i e 10 m 50 m 250 m and a transverse dispersivity and a vertical dispersivity of one tenth of the cell length i e 1 m 5 m 25 m output from these simulations were then mapped and compared to illustrate differences between spatial scales and dispersivity changes 4 results discussion 4 1 topographic indices the initial analysis of the dems used in this study looked at the slope figs 4 and 5 the roughness coefficients fig 6 and the wetness indices fig 7 as can be seen in the figures slope is reduced significantly when cell sizes coarsen from 3 m to 10 m additional reductions occur as the horizontal scale coarsens to 50 m and 250 m the 250 m dem is relatively flat with little variability visible this is expected as smoothing would result with resampling the dems resampling was done using arcgis by using the nearest neighbour method to determine the upscaled grid elevation value a clearer representation of the change in slope as dems coarsen is apparent in fig 5 which shows how the slope reduces to a narrow range and a shift towards smaller slopes as cell size coarsens to the 250 m grid size similar to the dem slope terrain roughness decreases as grid resolution coarsens with each subsequent coarsening the terrain roughness coefficient fig 6 decreases until at the 250 m dem it is largely a uniform low coefficient this can be attributed to smoothing as was seen with the changes in slope with dem coarsening in the figures multiple white spaces may be seen where waterbodies are located contrary to the slope and roughness coefficient the wetness index fig 7 experiences the opposite effect during resolution coarsening in the figures multiple white spaces may be seen where waterbodies are located at the finer resolutions the wetness index increases with a decrease in spatial resolution this is intuitively correct because the wetness index is expected to be large in flat areas and as has been shown with slope and the roughness coefficient the topography is getting progressively flatter as scale coarsens this may have an impact on simulated hydrological processes as more water is available at the topographic surface 4 2 exchange fluxes and hydraulic head after the hgs models have been run and the output i e heads exchange fluxes has been extracted and post processed it is possible to compare and to begin identifying relationships that exist between exchange fluxes and normalized hydraulic head fig 8 shows a plot of the fluxes from the 10 m 50 m and 250 m cells in equivalent 250 m cell areas i e one 250 m cell twenty five 50 m cells six hundred and twenty five 10 m cells plotted against normalized head as can be seen there are positive and negative exchange fluxes with negative fluxes predominantly in the 0 to 0 5 normalized head range and positive fluxes predominantly in the 0 5 to 1 normalized head range given that discharge zones typically exist in topographic lows and topographic highs are often associated with recharge zones it is logical that the model output shows that the lower topographic elevations have efflux rather than influx and higher elevations have influx over efflux the trend is most apparent by looking at the data points for the 250 m cells green data points a point of interest from this plot is that the range of normalized heads appears to reduce with finer spatial scales while the magnitude of the exchange fluxes is larger at finer spatial resolutions this is a potentially useful finding as it supports the theory that exchange flux magnitude may be muted at coarser scales which may be caused by recharge entering a cell and then discharging from the same cell if the water entering a large cell exits vertically before being transported laterally to another cell then it follows that exchange flux estimates could be dramatically different than in a smaller cell it is more difficult to extract a relationship of the positive and negative fluxes at finer resolutions but given that the fluxes are larger it may be possible to infer that the lateral transfer of water between cells is an important factor since the larger fluxes may imply that water that enters a cell via recharge then leaves a cell laterally before exiting via discharge through the groundwater surface water interface in another grid cell as grid cells increase in size the assumption is that lateral flow will be less likely to transport mass beyond the current cell boundary and hence this phenomena will become more apparent with increased cell size therefore the exchange flux from a smaller cell size may only reflect influx or efflux but not necessarily both 4 3 topographic scale as an initial assessment of how exchange fluxes vary with spatial scale the net exchange fluxes at equivalent 250 m grid scales were compared at the three horizontal spatial scales fig 9 shows that when the spatial scale changes and the exchange flux is compared at an equivalent area there are only small changes in magnitude the grey lines show individual location comparisons with the mean indicated in red this is intuitive as the net exchange fluxes for the same areal coverage should be similar however the magnitude of the positive and negative fluxes are not explicitly indicated here this may confirm that coarse cells are capturing both influx and efflux occurring within the same cell before lateral transport occurs unlike exchange flux estimates in the smaller cells to disseminate how the positive and negative aspects of the exchange fluxes are impacted at various spatial scales it is necessary to separate them from the net flux rate and analyze them at the various spatial scales they can then be plotted against their spatial scale to see if patterns emerge as can be seen in fig 10 when approximately 500 positive and 500 negative exchange fluxes from the same 250 m by 250 m areas are plotted at each scale a power law relationship emerges it can be easily seen that every 250 m grid cell equivalent yields a similar power law curve while these plots only show a small subset of the total data i e 11262 250 m cells and quickly become cluttered it provides insight into how exchange fluxes are affected by changes in spatial scale and the trend that exists as scales change to extract a relationship for the entire domain that is clearer the mean positive and mean negative exchange flux rates at each spatial scale were calculated fig 11 a shows this with a power law trend line it is clear that the influx and efflux rates at multiple scales follow a power law trend to prove this the same data was plotted on a log log plot see fig 11b the curve becomes a straight line confirming the power law relationship as was shown in beven 1984 selker et al 1999 rupp and selker 2005 cardenas 2008 troch et al 2008 harman et al 2009 snowdon and craig 2015 many hydrological processes can be represented using power laws the importance of this information for this study is that for the shallow water table systems investigated in this study the exchange fluxes are higher at finer scales and lower at coarse scales regardless of the type of flux larger amounts of influx and efflux occur in the same area when a terrain has a coarser discretization further supporting the idea that at coarser resolutions the vertical movement of water into and out of a single cell occurs prior to its movement laterally out of the cell but in finer resolutions water may move into or out of the cell laterally before it is moved vertically subsequent times hence lateral transport between cells has a larger impact on finer resolutions than on coarser ones specifically when looking at the vertical movement of water across the topographic surface to demonstrate how much influx and efflux occurs within a 250 m equivalent area the mean number of cells contributing to positive and negative exchange fluxes were calculated fig 12 a shows the percent of cells for the entire domain based on 250 m equivalent areas it shows that the change in the number of contributing cells follows a power law relationship as spatial scale changes this is confirmed through the log log plot of the data see fig 12b interestingly there is an increase in the area contributing to positive exchange fluxes as the scale coarsens that fits with expectations given that the topographic surface is flatter however the change in contributing area to both positive and negative fluxes only changes by approximately 3 approximately 350 cells out of 11 262 of the 250 m total cells 4 4 mean life expectancy because mean life expectancy quantifies the mean travel time for an average water particle to reach a discharge point i e ground surface it is possible to use the mle to examine how changes in horizontal scale may affect groundwater system behaviour at depth for constant dispersivity figs 13 and 14 present the ratio of log10 mle values for the 50 m and 250 m grid resolutions respectively compared to the 10 m grid resolution values greater than unity shown in red indicate that the mle value is greater for the 50 m or 250 m grid resolutions than the 10 m grid resolution values less than unity shown in blue indicate the opposite when looking at the 50 10 and 250 10 mle ratios at shallow depths 50 m depth shown in figs 13a and 14a it can be seen that the 50 m scale mles are greater than the 10 m scale mles this also occurs in both ratios at the 100 m depth figs 13b and 14b at depths of 200 m 400 m and 600 m the 50 10 mle ratios are nearly unity fig 13 the majority of visible differences disappear once the 200 m depth fig 13c e is reached indicating that for similar dispersivities larger than the grid resolution mle values at the 10 m and 50 m scales are similar small differences exist but they are not visible in the figure at depths below 200 m the 250 10 mle ratios see fig 14 decrease toward unity as depth increases the mle ratios approach unity although more slowly than in the 50 10 mle ratio case in the 250 10 mle ratios some mle values are smaller at the 250 m scale than the 10 m scale although the majority are higher when the dispersivities are adjusted in each simulation to match the cell lengths of their respective models see figs 15 and 16 there is a noticeable change the 50 10 mle ratio appears to have equal amounts of ratios above and below unity for 50 m depth fig 15a whereas the 250 m scale mles are generally larger than the 10 m scale mles at 50 m depth fig 16a as depth increases the ratios reduce however there is a clear difference visible at every depth unlike in the 50 10 mle ratio figures for the mles with matching dispersivities fig 13 the 50 10 mle ratio for dispersivities matching cell length shows less variation and extremes from unity than the 250 10 ratio which has more positive mle ratio values indicating higher mles at the 250 m scale as compared to the 10 m scale it is apparent that the groundwater system at various depths and hence the mles at the 10 m and 50 m scale are closer in value than the 10 m and 250 m mle values in fact a much larger disparity is visible in all 250 10 mle ratio figures as compared to the 50 10 mle ratio figures given that it is common to use a dispersivity that is limited by a cell s length the calculated mles for coarser scales are greater due primarily to reduced hydraulic gradients and hence reduced advective velocities this results in longer average water particle travel times and greater mle values than at finer resolutions 4 5 physical parameters and scale having established that exchange fluxes vary with spatial scale and that finer resolutions appear to have larger exchange fluxes with a smaller normalized head range figs 11 and 12 it would be appropriate to look at possible physical explanations for these effects it is suspected that terrain indices may in part indicate how exchange fluxes are impacted by scale changes fig 17 shows the terrain slope statistics at multiple spatial scales the maximum slope quickly decreases as the slope becomes flatter mean slope and standard deviation also decreases but not as significantly as the maximum the minimum slope value is equal to zero at all horizontal scales the terrain roughness coefficient does not show quick or large changes with spatial scale variation fig 18 the mean decreases slightly but the most prominent change occurs between the 50 m and 250 m scales there is a pronounced difference in the maximum roughness coefficient the minimum is no longer zero the only spatial scale without a zero minimum and the standard deviation drops lower than the 3 m scale this may indicate that terrain roughness is not a significant index for relating exchange fluxes to spatial scale the last terrain index examined is the wetness index fig 19 shows the wetness indices at every spatial scale the minimum mean and maximum wetness indices show a general increase as scale coarsens with the exception of the 250 m maximum value this fits with earlier expectations of flatter terrains having a larger wetness index and would indicate that coarser resolutions are more susceptible to saturated topographic surfaces and more prone to losses through ill defined aspects of overland flow such as rivulets rills and ditches at larger scales or possibly discharge through the topographic surface 4 6 implications if exchange fluxes at the point scale can be considered physically accurate and true then it would seem an appropriate assumption that exchange flux estimates at ever coarsening scales given the noticed differences shown in this paper are empirical and scale dependent the implication being that exchange fluxes cannot be simulated at multiple scales using the same methods they are not a fixed value except at the point scale as any integration results in a reduction of the flux rate the primary goal of this work was to assess how exchange fluxes were affected by horizontal spatial scale in a shallow water table system of the canadian shield the use of mle simulations provided additional insights on the impact of horizontal scale on the groundwater system of the canadian shield this study raises a new concern for locations that are in shallow water table crystalline rock settings and indicates that the modelling of the surface shallow groundwater and potentially the deep groundwater system need to be treated as scale dependent if a coarse scale is used in simulations the magnitude and distribution of the exchange fluxes may not be representative of the point scale estimates this would be of concern if the purpose of the simulation were to model solute transport the mle simulations indicate that as spatial scale coarsens changes in the subsurface may not be adequately represented characterization choices such as dispersivity values must be justified to assess the impact they have on the behaviour of the subsurface in regional models little can be inferred about how to mitigate this situation other than the use of finer resolution grids when attempting to determine mle at depth as to what scale is appropriate that would need to be determined on a case by case basis for an individual site based on the physics and the impacts on simulated results however as this study has shown the results when using a 50 m grid can provide similar results to the 10 m grid even though it is 25 times smaller the 250 m grid may be too coarse as the results have been clearly shown to deviate from the 10 m grid results while this work is suggesting that every model grid size should be determined for an individual site it appears at least for this site that the use of a 50 m grid may provide an acceptable compromise between model size and capturing system behaviour 5 conclusion the purpose of this paper was to determine how changes in horizontal spatial scales in hydrological models affect groundwater surface water exchange fluxes it is possible to see that as spatial scales coarsen the net exchange fluxes are less than the point scale estimates at the finer resolutions this trend is consistent across the entire canadian shield site modelled in this study determining why this occurs involved looking at terrain indices and exchange fluxes in order to quantify how these indices and exchange fluxes are impacted by spatial scales understanding how models represent a physical location at various horizontal spatial scales and how this affects exchange fluxes should be included in the justification and explanation of upscaled regional modelling results at this point little conclusive evidence exists to indicate how terrain indices can be used to predict model results when using upscaled regional models however this paper provides a needed explanation of why point scale processes are not captured in discretized models it has been confirmed that exchange fluxes are scale dependent and hence empirical for groundwater systems exchange flux magnitudes are sensitive and proportional to both the hydraulic conductivity of the shallow bedrock and the hydraulic gradient which also adds to the empiricism of the exchange fluxes given these dependencies and the strong empiricism in shallow groundwater system models any modelling at non point scales becomes subject to increased uncertainty this uncertainty means that the magnitude and distribution of exchange fluxes cannot be predicted prior to simulations making the ideal choice of horizontal spatial scale for a location difficult to choose as was discussed in the implications section following this research it appears that for this site it could be possible to use a 50 m grid scale as the results are similar to the 10 m grid scale however the 250 m grid scale results deviate significantly from the other two which makes it not an ideal choice this paper investigated fluid transfer and mle but the implications could include other mass transport scenarios as grid block sizes increase a larger amount of dispersion numerical and due to larger dispersivities will occur resulting in greater spreading of solutes hydraulic gradients and thus fluid advective velocities are reduced thereby enhancing solute travel times and increasing mle values an extension of this would be to conclude that if the objective of an analysis is the estimation of contaminant migration to a discharge point from a source at depth in a rock mass the result will be sensitive to the scale of the modelling in almost every scenario that was tested however at this time few conclusions can be made regarding scale dependencies in deep groundwater systems as they are beyond the scope of this paper the scale dependency of exchange fluxes is also expected to occur in integrated surface water groundwater models and it must be recognized that integrated models would not solve the problem of scale dependency if a model is upscaled from the point scale exchange flux estimates will be affected most likely due to loss of the sub grid details e g topography slope that are not characterized in the upscaled model this means that when upscaled or regional models are used it becomes necessary for the researchers to comment on the scale of the grid and to explain the impact of the scale choice on the upscaled exchange fluxes credit authorship contribution statement

tsinghua university beijing 100084 china corresponding author graphical abstract soil carbon c and nitrogen n cycles and their complex responses to hydro climatic forcing have gained increasing attention while the temperature effects have been intensively studied soil moisture response functions smrfs are not well documented for various microbial and enzymatic processes due to the difficulties in directly measuring and differentiating the moisture effects on various processes here we extended our c only microbial enzyme decomposition mend model to the c n coupled mend model with flexible element stoichiometry our model calibration showed good agreement between simulated and observed c n ratios in soil organic matter and microbial biomass as well as the ammonium and nitrate concentrations we show that the selection of smrfs for specific biogeochemical processes could result in significant differences in model simulated microbial and c n processes in particular it is essential to account for the soil moisture effects on microbial dormancy and resuscitation as the changes in microbial physiology under favorable or stressful conditions will exert strong controls on soil c and n dynamics we also advocate the utilization of dynamic time variant data e g litter input n deposition soil temperature and moisture instead of time invariant data to drive model simulations and analyses dynamic forcing data particularly dynamic soil moisture better represent the real world climate and environmental conditions which could facilitate more realistic modeling and understanding of soil c and nutrient cycling in a changing world keywords dynamic data microbial modeling microbial dormancy soil carbon and nitrogen soil microbe soil moisture 1 introduction soil carbon c and nutrient cycles and their complex responses to hydro climatic forcing have gained increasing attention during the last two decades bradford et al 2016 campo and merino 2016 crowther et al 2016 manzoni et al 2004 while the temperature effects have been intensively studied allison et al 2010 carey et al 2016 crowther et al 2016 frey et al 2013 tang and riley 2015 it remains a challenge to separate the effects from both soil temperature and moisture campo and merino 2016 davidson et al 2012 ohashi et al 2008 rowland et al 2014 the effect of soil moisture on soil c and nutrient dynamics cannot be neglected because soil microbes mediate these processes and fluctuations in microbial activities in response to soil moisture changes are ubiquitous manzoni et al 2012a when soil becomes drier the microbial metabolic activity generally is depressed which might reduce heterotrophic respiration and nitrogen n mineralization schimel et al 2007 a reduction of 10 in soil water content swc led to a 10 80 decrease in β glucosidase activity in mediterranean evergreen forests sardans and penuelas 2005 the β glucosidase and endo glucanase activities showed significantly higher correlations with soil moisture than temperature and ph in the study by criquet et al 2002 however saturated water conditions could reduce the phenol oxidases activity due to oxygen deficiency freeman et al 2001 therefore quantifying the soil moisture effects in ecosystem modeling helps to understand the underlying mechanisms regulating soil c and nutrient cycling the incorporation of soil moisture response functions smrfs significantly improved the modeling of soil organic matter som decomposition and soil respiration ise and moorcroft 2006 liang et al 2019 as the activities of lignocellulose degrading enzymes and respiration were highly affected by the changes in moisture content baldrian and stursova 2011 current soil c and ecosystem models usually use smrfs to modify som decomposition rates ma and shaffer 2001 shi et al 2015 wu and mcgechan 1998 or microbial respiration rates moyano et al 2013 soil moisture availability will influence microbial growth maintenance mortality reactivation and dormancy and enzyme activities baldrian and stursova 2011 wang et al 2019 all of which underlie the mechanisms controlling microbially mediated soil biogeochemical processes for example microbes mainly bacteria tend to become dormant under low moisture conditions wang et al 2019 wang et al 2015 the same swc in different organic solvents or soils could result in completely different amounts of water bound on the enzymes zaks and klibanov 1988 thus water activity or potential instead of swc has been widely used in smrfs to characterize the effect of water on microbial and enzyme activities goujard et al 2009 halling 1994 manzoni et al 2012b wang et al 2019 unfortunately smrfs are not well documented for various microbial and enzymatic processes due to the difficulties in directly measuring the effects on different processes wallenstein and weintraub 2008 our previous model data fusion study in subtropical forests showed higher microbial biomass and active fraction of microbes in the wet season than in the dry season in which distinct smrfs were adopted and parameterized for different processes including oxidative and hydrolytic decomposition microbial mortality dormancy and resuscitation wang et al 2019 different smrfs may impose different effects on microbial and enzyme activities which further alter the mineralization of soil organic c and n the immobilization of inorganic n as well as the nitrification and denitrification processes however it remains unclear whether an alternative smrf would significantly affect the c n processes in soils in addition current testing and evaluation of microbially enabled biogeochemical models often use steady state analyses with time invariant forcing data e g constant soil temperature moisture and litter input as such model simulations are easy to implement and convenient for analyses e g allison et al 2010 sulman et al 2018 wang et al 2013 the findings from these simplified analyses have been assumed to be capable of characterizing ecosystem responses to environmental perturbations or changes such as positive negative or neutral responses to warming drought or litter addition hagerty et al 2014 sulman et al 2018 however if the model behaviors are qualitatively different e g positive vs negative effect between simulations with constant and dynamic data we need to be cautious in extrapolating the findings based on constant data as these climatic and environmental forcings usually vary with time for this reason there is a need to understand if model behaviors will be consistent when a model is driven by constant or dynamic forcing data in order to answer these questions we extended our c only microbial enzyme decomposition mend model to the c n coupled mend model with flexible elemental stoichiometry buchkowski et al 2015 sistla and schimel 2012 we focused on the selection of smrfs for different biogeochemical processes and their impacts on soil c and n cycling we also examined if the mend modeling with dynamic forcings particularly time variant soil moisture could generate substantially different results from those driven by time invariant data 2 materials and methods 2 1 carbon nitrogen coupled mend model we developed a new version of the mend model i e the c n coupled mend model fig 1 the c only mend describes the som decomposition processes by explicitly representing relevant microbial and enzymatic physiology wang et al 2019 wang et al 2015 wang et al 2013 the som pool consists of two particulate organic matter pom pools and one mineral associated organic matter mom pool the two poms are decomposed by oxidative and hydrolytic enzymes respectively the mom is decomposed by a general enzyme group em the c n coupled mend represents additional c n transformation processes soil organic n son decomposition coupled to the soil organic c soc decomposition microbial n mineralization and immobilization nitrification denitrification wang and chen 2013 and nitrifier denitrification wrage mönnig et al 2018 zhu et al 2013 model state variables governing equations component fluxes and parameters are described in tables 1 4 respectively in contrast to traditional models that use fixed som c n ratios bonan et al 2013 thornton and rosenbloom 2005 we use flexible stoichiometry i e time variant c n ratio for som and microbial biomass pools to more realistically represent the adaption of microbes in response to the stoichiometric imbalance of available resources fanin et al 2017 as for the enzyme pools a fixed c n ratio 3 is used based on schimel and weinstraub 2003 generally the son flux will follow the soc flux according to the c n ratio in the upstream source pool see eq 13 in table 2 the c n ratios in the som pools including pomo pomh mom qom dom will be regulated by the litter input c n fluxes from upstream pools and or microbial turnover the c n ratio in the microbial biomass pool is self regulated by the dom uptake heterotrophic respiration rh n mineralization and immobilization rh is mainly controlled by the intrinsic c use efficiency yg or intrinsic cue see eqs 27 31 in addition to the availability of don and mineral n nh4 and no3 we define an intrinsic n use efficiency yng or intrinsic nue see eq 38 in table 3 to modify n mineralization rate eq 37 and immobilization rate eqs 35 36 in eq 38 we first assume a conservative c n range i e between cnba min and cnba max to represent the stoichiometric plasticity of microbial communities cleveland and liptzin 2007 fanin et al 2017 zechmeister boltenstern et al 2015 intrinsic nue yng in eq 38 will increase with increasing microbial c n ratio cnba with yng being 0 when cnba cnba min c limited and yng approaching 1 when cnba cnba max n limited this means that n mineralization rate will decrease and n immobilization rate will increase when microorganisms become more n limited resulting in higher yng mooshammer et al 2014 a model parameter reaction rate in mend may be modified by soil moisture temperature and or ph wang et al 2019 mend represents nitrification denitrification microbial dormancy resuscitation and mortality and enzymatic decomposition in response to changes in moisture as well as shifts in microbial and enzymatic activities with changing temperature wang et al 2019 the intrinsic cue yg in table 4 decreases with increasing temperature following a linear function li et al 2019 wang et al 2019 the temperature sensitivities of microbial and enzyme activities are modeled by the q10 method wang et al 2012 or the arrhenius equation characterized by the activation energy wang et al 2013 the following section describes the smrfs for different processes as soil moisture effect is the focus of this study 2 2 soil moisture response functions we use different smrfs wang et al 2019 to describe the influences of soil moisture on the enzyme mediated som decomposition processes microbial mortality

2019 are also shown in fig 2a soil water potential greatly affects the microbial dormancy and reactivation processes and various sigmoidal type switching functions have been proposed to quantify these

within the dinghushan biosphere reserve dbr in south china wang et al 2019 the broadleaf forest is distributed in the core area of the reserve the forest has not been disturbed for more than 400 years according to previous studies zhou et al 2006 the mean annual precipitation is about 1678 mm of which nearly 80 falls in the hot humid season from april to september and the remainder in the dry season from october to march soils in dbr are classified as ultisols according to the usda soil taxonomy soil survey staff 1999 the model simulation period covered the three year observational period august 2009 december 2012 soil temperature and swc at 10 cm depth were measured by a digital thermometer and a mpkit ict international armidale nsw australia respectively tang et al 2006 the swc was converted to soil water potential swp using a soil water retention curve characterized by the van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 monthly n deposition rates were measured from 2009 to 2012 the average total wet dry nh4 and no3 deposition rates were 2 1 and 1 2 g n m 2 yr 1 respectively soil respiration was measured using the li 8100 automated soil co2 flux system li cor inc lincoln ne usa microbial biomass c and n were determined by the fumigation extraction method wu et al 1990 ammonium and nitrate were extracted with 2 m kcl and determined with a flow injection analysis automated ion

extractable nh4 and no3 concentrations 2 4 model calibration we calibrated the mend parameters controlling som decomposition using observed rh and mbc in previous study wang et al 2019 in the current study we further calibrated the mend parameters related to n mineralization immobilization nitrification and denitrification parameter 30 35 in table 4 using observed data including som c n ratio somcn mbcn and extractable nh4 and no3 concentrations the model calibration period covered from august 2009 to december 2012 we used the modified shuffled complex evolution sce algorithm to implement

examine soil c n responses to different smrfs and forcing data the first set scenario f0 f4 see table 6 was designed to explore if different smrfs would result in significant differences in modeling results we assigned different smrfs to pomo decomposition pomh and mom decomposition microbial mortality dormancy and resuscitation table 6 we conducted long term mend simulations beyond the calibration period 2009 2012 by repeatedly using the dynamic forcing data from the calibration period we calculated the mean concentrations of soc mineral n i e mn nh4 no3 active microbial biomass c active mbc after the model reached the dynamic steady state we then calculated the active fraction of microbial biomass active mbc under each scenario percent change in soc δsoc and mineral n δmn relative to the soc and mn under baseline scenario f0 the second set scenario d0 d4 see table 7 was to investigate if model simulations with constant time invariant data litter input soil temperature and moisture would be different from those with dynamic time variant data the constant and dynamic data for modeling are shown in fig 3 we first run the model with scenario d0 i e constant litter input soil temperature and moisture see table 7 to reach the steady state following which we then run mend under scenario d1 d4 table 7 to reach a new dynamic steady state we then calculated active mbc and active mbc under each scenario and δsoc and δmn relative to the socss and mnss under baseline scenario d0 here we asked whether there would be significant changes between simulations driven by constant and dynamic data whereas we did not intend to provide accurate estimates for the steady state c and n contents such as socss and mnss the reason is that the first steady state in all scenarios was determined by model calibration and simulations with constant data i e litter input soil temperature and moisture followed by which a new steady state was achieved by varying one of the data categories scenario d1 d3 or varying all data d4 the third set of experiments table 8 was to examine whether the effects of litter addition on soil c and n would be different when constant scenario l0 or dynamic scenario l1 data litter input n deposition soil temperature and moisture were used for each of the two scenarios we designed two treatments a control treatment with observed litter input rate mean rate for scenario l0 and time variant rate for scenario l1 and a litter addition treatment with 11 more litter input than the control treatment regarding scenario l0 we first run the model with constant data to reach the steady state we then run mend with litter addition i e by 11 as described in wang et al 2019 to reach a new steady state as per scenario l1 with dynamic data we also run mend with litter addition 11 to reach a new dynamic steady state following the first steady state achieved by dynamic data for each scenario with constant or dynamic data δsoc and δmn were calculated as the percent changes in socss and mnss between the two steady states i e the two treatments litter addition vs control 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration with n data we have shown good performances in simulating rh and mbc by the c only mend model in previous study wang et al 2019 our calibration of the c n coupled mend model also achieved good agreement between simulated and observed somcn mbcn nh4 and no3 concentrations fig 4 the simulated mean somcn was 13 8 which was only 6 higher than the observed value fig 4a the simulated daily data during 2009 2012 showed mbcn between 5 9 and 7 6 and the mean mbcn was consistent with the observed mbcn fig 4a the simulated mbcn 7 data points exhibited a much smaller variation than the observations mostly because there was one measurement of mbcn 13 8 in august 2011 which was much higher than the other 6 observed mbcn values 4 5 7 7 in addition the simulated soil nh4 and no3 concentrations also agreed well with the observations with no3 exhibiting a larger variation in model simulations than in observations fig 4b we did not explicitly simulate no3 leaching and plant uptake of nh4 and no3 as no data were available for validation however our nitrification and denitrification simulations implicitly included these fluxes since we constrained the model by using observed somcn mbcn nh4 or no3 concentrations in addition to rh and mbc 3 2 soil microbes and c n in response to different soil moisture response functions smrfs in fig 5 a we showed the percent changes in soc δsoc and mineral n δmn under scenario f1 f4 with different smrfs relative to the soc and mn under baseline scenario f0 with default smrfs without consideration of the soil moisture effects on microbial dormancy and resuscitation scenario f1 in table 6 the steady state soc socss would increase significantly by 226 compared to the baseline scenario f0 socss fig 5a no smrfs to modify microbial dormancy and resuscitation rates also resulted in negative change in mineral n concentration δmn 7 this could be explained by the lowest active mbc and active mbc under scenario f1 among all scenarios consequently resulting in the lowest microbial and enzyme activities and the accumulation of soc under scenario f1 the low active mbc and som decomposition rate under scenario f1 further led to less net n mineralization fluxes by 35 and reduced mineral n when soil moisture effect was not considered for microbial dormancy and reactivation under scenario f1 substrate i e doc limitation became dominant and caused higher dormancy rates than resuscitation rates in early stage of the simulation period ultimately resulting in low active mbc and active mbc in other word when soil moisture effect was combined with the effect of substrate availability it could lead to higher resuscitation rates than dormancy rates under wet conditions which alleviated the single substrate limiting effect to some extent scenario f0 there were no changes in soc mn and active mbc when the same smrf eq 43 was applied to both oxidative and hydrolytic decomposition processes scenario f2 fig 5a this was expected due to all observed swp values in the study site being lower than 0 003 mpa or swc 0 494 fig 3c which was not able to cause significant effects on soil microbial and c n dynamics between the two smrfs shown in fig 2a we anticipated there might be changes in soil c n under scenario f2 if the soil moisture data could cover the range beyond greater than 0 003 mpa in fig 2a because saturation of soil moisture would depress the activity of oxidative enzymes due to oxygen limitation freeman et al 2001 a single smrf like eq 43 has often been used to modify the decomposition rates of all soil c pools liang 2019 oleson 2013 partly due to the generally low occurrence probability for extremely high or low soil moisture as well as the difficulty in differentiating the soil moisture effects between multiple decomposition processes we also found significant increases in socss when the function 1 fsm2 fsm2 denotes eq 43 was assigned to microbial mortality and dormancy and the function fsm2 assigned to microbial resuscitation scenario f3 and f4 fig 5a however these positive effects were much smaller than the effect by scenario f1 owing to the active mbc concentrations and microbial activities under scenario f3 and f4 were lower than those under f0 but higher than those under f1 the above analyses in terms of different smrfs indicated that the selection of smrfs could lead to significant differences in model simulations of soil microbial and c n processes particularly remarkable differences in soil c and n cycling could occur between with and without accounting for the soil moisture effects on microbial dormancy and resuscitation scenario f1 vs f0 in fig 5a as microbial physiological states will switch under favorable or stressful environmental conditions bär et al 2002 stolpovsky et al 2011 wang et al 2019 3 3 constant versus dynamic litter input soil temperature or moisture among the four scenarios d1 d4 with constant and or dynamic data litter input soil temperature and moisture only the scenarios with dynamic soil moisture caused significant changes in socss and mnss compared to those under the baseline scenario d0 with constant litter input soil temperature and moisture fig 5b the δsoc was 73 and 88 under scenario d3 dynamic soil moisture and d4 dynamic litter input soil temperature and moisture respectively our results showed that under scenarios d0 d2 without soil moisture dynamics active mbc and active mbc were almost the same with nearly all microbes being active active mbc 98 due to no water stress when the constant swc 0 253 was used for modeling however dynamic soil moisture resulted in lower active mbc and more reasonable active mbc 31 and consequently reduced microbial and enzyme activities further leading to the accumulation of soc though the net n mineralization flux decreased by 12 relative to scenario d0 there was still an accumulation of mineral n 36 under scenario d3 and d4 due to reduced n loss via denitrification the above analyses implied that the utilization of field observed dynamic time variant data particularly dynamic soil moisture could result in dynamic microbial community and physiology subsequently leading to substantially different soil c and n processes this was further evidenced by direct comparisons between experimental observations and model simulations driven by constant or dynamic data fig 6 the simulated rh agreed well with the observations r2 0 68 during 2009 2012 when the model was driven by dynamic ltw dynamic litter input soil temperature and moisture fig 6a when constant litter input was used the simulated rh values were similar to those by dynamic ltw with a little bit lower r2 0 63 when constant soil temperature was used higher discrepancies exhibited between simulated and observed rh r2 0 54 in which high rh fluxes were generally underestimated in addition most of the rh fluxes were greatly overestimated by the model driven by constant soil moistures fig 6a consistent mbc results were modeled no matter what constant or dynamic litter input or soil temperature data were employed fig 6b however the utilization of constant soil moisture resulted in significant overestimates of mbc fig 6b which elucidated the overestimated rh fluxes fig 6a our results indicated that seasonal variations in soil moisture play an important role in regulating microbial and c n cycling it is possible that significant differences would also appear when dynamic litter input or temperature data from other study sites were used which conveys the same message that dynamic versus constant data may result in completely different modeling results even when the same model structure is used 3 4 dynamics versus constant data result in different responses to litter addition when constant data litter input n deposition soil temperature and moisture were used to drive model simulations litter addition 11 caused positive effects on both soc 11 and mineral n 7 however with dynamic data as the driving force litter addition average of 11 resulted in insignificant change in soc 2 p value greater than 0 05 but significant negative response in mineral n 9 fig 7 we didn t see a significant increase in microbial biomass or active biomass likely because almost all microbes 98 had already become active due to no environmental stress when constant forcing data were used as a result the microbial and enzyme activity didn t change under litter addition finally leading to the accumulation of soc and mineral n on the contrary there was an 58 increase in active mbc under dynamic data and litter addition which led to higher microbial and enzyme activities and ultimately unchanged soc though both net n mineralization and denitrification slightly increased by 0 8 and 0 5 respectively net mineral n loss was found when dynamic data were used due to the denitrification flux being higher than the sum of n deposition and net n mineralization in brief the responses of soil c and n to litter addition could be qualitatively different when constant or dynamic data were used to drive model simulations our results highlighted the necessity to account for the seasonality of environmental factors for a better understanding of priming effects in field conditions priming effects often refer to the changes in the som decomposition caused by the addition of organic or mineral substrates such as fresh litter root exudates and fertilizer blagodatskaya and kuzyakov 2008 in addition interventions such as drying and wetting could also contribute to priming effects kuzyakov et al 2000 both positive and negative soc responses to litter addition have been observed in short and long term experiments lajtha et al 2014a lajtha et al 2014b pisani et al 2016 sulman et al 2018 when time invariant data were employed to drive model simulations we found a negative priming effect leading to the accumulation of soc on the contrary we showed a positive priming effect i e more native soc loss via co2 with litter addition in this old broadleaf forest when dynamic data were used in our previous study on a different forest young pine forest in the same area we demonstrated a negative priming effect by the modeling with seasonal data these experimental and modeling results imply that differential priming effects could appear in different ecosystems under similar or distinct environmental conditions due to the complicated mechanisms for the changes in soil microbial community and activity in response to substrate additions and or environmental change 4 conclusions the c n coupled mend modeling regarding different smrfs indicated that the selection of smrfs for specific biogeochemical processes could result in distinct differences in model simulations of soil microbial and c n processes in particular it is essential to accounting for the soil moisture effects on microbial dormancy and resuscitation as the changes in microbial physiology under favorable or stressful conditions will exert strong controls on soil c and n dynamics without consideration of the soil moisture effects on microbial dormancy and resuscitation the steady state soc socss would increase significantly compared to the baseline socss whereas mineral n concentration would decrease among the four scenarios with constant and or dynamic data only the scenarios with dynamic soil moisture caused significant changes in socss and mnss compared to those under the baseline scenario with constant data we also show that the responses of soil c and n to litter addition could be qualitatively different when constant or dynamic data were used to drive model simulations therefore we advocate the utilization of dynamic data instead of time invariant data to drive model simulations and analyses dynamic forcing data from measurements or reanalysis better represent the real world climate and environmental conditions which could facilitate more realistic modeling and understanding of soil c and nutrient cycling in a changing world declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

tsinghua university beijing 100084 china corresponding author graphical abstract soil carbon c and nitrogen n cycles and their complex responses to hydro climatic forcing have gained increasing attention while the temperature effects have been intensively studied soil moisture response functions smrfs are not well documented for various microbial and enzymatic processes due to the difficulties in directly measuring and differentiating the moisture effects on various processes here we extended our c only microbial enzyme decomposition mend model to the c n coupled mend model with flexible element stoichiometry our model calibration showed good agreement between simulated and observed c n ratios in soil organic matter and microbial biomass as well as the ammonium and nitrate concentrations we show that the selection of smrfs for specific biogeochemical processes could result in significant differences in model simulated microbial and c n processes in particular it is essential to account for the soil moisture effects on microbial dormancy and resuscitation as the changes in microbial physiology under favorable or stressful conditions will exert strong controls on soil c and n dynamics we also advocate the utilization of dynamic time variant data e g litter input n deposition soil temperature and moisture instead of time invariant data to drive model simulations and analyses dynamic forcing data particularly dynamic soil moisture better represent the real world climate and environmental conditions which could facilitate more realistic modeling and understanding of soil c and nutrient cycling in a changing world keywords dynamic data microbial modeling microbial dormancy soil carbon and nitrogen soil microbe soil moisture 1 introduction soil carbon c and nutrient cycles and their complex responses to hydro climatic forcing have gained increasing attention during the last two decades bradford et al 2016 campo and merino 2016 crowther et al 2016 manzoni et al 2004 while the temperature effects have been intensively studied allison et al 2010 carey et al 2016 crowther et al 2016 frey et al 2013 tang and riley 2015 it remains a challenge to separate the effects from both soil temperature and moisture campo and merino 2016 davidson et al 2012 ohashi et al 2008 rowland et al 2014 the effect of soil moisture on soil c and nutrient dynamics cannot be neglected because soil microbes mediate these processes and fluctuations in microbial activities in response to soil moisture changes are ubiquitous manzoni et al 2012a when soil becomes drier the microbial metabolic activity generally is depressed which might reduce heterotrophic respiration and nitrogen n mineralization schimel et al 2007 a reduction of 10 in soil water content swc led to a 10 80 decrease in β glucosidase activity in mediterranean evergreen forests sardans and penuelas 2005 the β glucosidase and endo glucanase activities showed significantly higher correlations with soil moisture than temperature and ph in the study by criquet et al 2002 however saturated water conditions could reduce the phenol oxidases activity due to oxygen deficiency freeman et al 2001 therefore quantifying the soil moisture effects in ecosystem modeling helps to understand the underlying mechanisms regulating soil c and nutrient cycling the incorporation of soil moisture response functions smrfs significantly improved the modeling of soil organic matter som decomposition and soil respiration ise and moorcroft 2006 liang et al 2019 as the activities of lignocellulose degrading enzymes and respiration were highly affected by the changes in moisture content baldrian and stursova 2011 current soil c and ecosystem models usually use smrfs to modify som decomposition rates ma and shaffer 2001 shi et al 2015 wu and mcgechan 1998 or microbial respiration rates moyano et al 2013 soil moisture availability will influence microbial growth maintenance mortality reactivation and dormancy and enzyme activities baldrian and stursova 2011 wang et al 2019 all of which underlie the mechanisms controlling microbially mediated soil biogeochemical processes for example microbes mainly bacteria tend to become dormant under low moisture conditions wang et al 2019 wang et al 2015 the same swc in different organic solvents or soils could result in completely different amounts of water bound on the enzymes zaks and klibanov 1988 thus water activity or potential instead of swc has been widely used in smrfs to characterize the effect of water on microbial and enzyme activities goujard et al 2009 halling 1994 manzoni et al 2012b wang et al 2019 unfortunately smrfs are not well documented for various microbial and enzymatic processes due to the difficulties in directly measuring the effects on different processes wallenstein and weintraub 2008 our previous model data fusion study in subtropical forests showed higher microbial biomass and active fraction of microbes in the wet season than in the dry season in which distinct smrfs were adopted and parameterized for different processes including oxidative and hydrolytic decomposition microbial mortality dormancy and resuscitation wang et al 2019 different smrfs may impose different effects on microbial and enzyme activities which further alter the mineralization of soil organic c and n the immobilization of inorganic n as well as the nitrification and denitrification processes however it remains unclear whether an alternative smrf would significantly affect the c n processes in soils in addition current testing and evaluation of microbially enabled biogeochemical models often use steady state analyses with time invariant forcing data e g constant soil temperature moisture and litter input as such model simulations are easy to implement and convenient for analyses e g allison et al 2010 sulman et al 2018 wang et al 2013 the findings from these simplified analyses have been assumed to be capable of characterizing ecosystem responses to environmental perturbations or changes such as positive negative or neutral responses to warming drought or litter addition hagerty et al 2014 sulman et al 2018 however if the model behaviors are qualitatively different e g positive vs negative effect between simulations with constant and dynamic data we need to be cautious in extrapolating the findings based on constant data as these climatic and environmental forcings usually vary with time for this reason there is a need to understand if model behaviors will be consistent when a model is driven by constant or dynamic forcing data in order to answer these questions we extended our c only microbial enzyme decomposition mend model to the c n coupled mend model with flexible elemental stoichiometry buchkowski et al 2015 sistla and schimel 2012 we focused on the selection of smrfs for different biogeochemical processes and their impacts on soil c and n cycling we also examined if the mend modeling with dynamic forcings particularly time variant soil moisture could generate substantially different results from those driven by time invariant data 2 materials and methods 2 1 carbon nitrogen coupled mend model we developed a new version of the mend model i e the c n coupled mend model fig 1 the c only mend describes the som decomposition processes by explicitly representing relevant microbial and enzymatic physiology wang et al 2019 wang et al 2015 wang et al 2013 the som pool consists of two particulate organic matter pom pools and one mineral associated organic matter mom pool the two poms are decomposed by oxidative and hydrolytic enzymes respectively the mom is decomposed by a general enzyme group em the c n coupled mend represents additional c n transformation processes soil organic n son decomposition coupled to the soil organic c soc decomposition microbial n mineralization and immobilization nitrification denitrification wang and chen 2013 and nitrifier denitrification wrage mönnig et al 2018 zhu et al 2013 model state variables governing equations component fluxes and parameters are described in tables 1 4 respectively in contrast to traditional models that use fixed som c n ratios bonan et al 2013 thornton and rosenbloom 2005 we use flexible stoichiometry i e time variant c n ratio for som and microbial biomass pools to more realistically represent the adaption of microbes in response to the stoichiometric imbalance of available resources fanin et al 2017 as for the enzyme pools a fixed c n ratio 3 is used based on schimel and weinstraub 2003 generally the son flux will follow the soc flux according to the c n ratio in the upstream source pool see eq 13 in table 2 the c n ratios in the som pools including pomo pomh mom qom dom will be regulated by the litter input c n fluxes from upstream pools and or microbial turnover the c n ratio in the microbial biomass pool is self regulated by the dom uptake heterotrophic respiration rh n mineralization and immobilization rh is mainly controlled by the intrinsic c use efficiency yg or intrinsic cue see eqs 27 31 in addition to the availability of don and mineral n nh4 and no3 we define an intrinsic n use efficiency yng or intrinsic nue see eq 38 in table 3 to modify n mineralization rate eq 37 and immobilization rate eqs 35 36 in eq 38 we first assume a conservative c n range i e between cnba min and cnba max to represent the stoichiometric plasticity of microbial communities cleveland and liptzin 2007 fanin et al 2017 zechmeister boltenstern et al 2015 intrinsic nue yng in eq 38 will increase with increasing microbial c n ratio cnba with yng being 0 when cnba cnba min c limited and yng approaching 1 when cnba cnba max n limited this means that n mineralization rate will decrease and n immobilization rate will increase when microorganisms become more n limited resulting in higher yng mooshammer et al 2014 a model parameter reaction rate in mend may be modified by soil moisture temperature and or ph wang et al 2019 mend represents nitrification denitrification microbial dormancy resuscitation and mortality and enzymatic decomposition in response to changes in moisture as well as shifts in microbial and enzymatic activities with changing temperature wang et al 2019 the intrinsic cue yg in table 4 decreases with increasing temperature following a linear function li et al 2019 wang et al 2019 the temperature sensitivities of microbial and enzyme activities are modeled by the q10 method wang et al 2012 or the arrhenius equation characterized by the activation energy wang et al 2013 the following section describes the smrfs for different processes as soil moisture effect is the focus of this study 2 2 soil moisture response functions we use different smrfs wang et al 2019 to describe the influences of soil moisture on the enzyme mediated som decomposition processes microbial mortality

2019 are also shown in fig 2a soil water potential greatly affects the microbial dormancy and reactivation processes and various sigmoidal type switching functions have been proposed to quantify these

within the dinghushan biosphere reserve dbr in south china wang et al 2019 the broadleaf forest is distributed in the core area of the reserve the forest has not been disturbed for more than 400 years according to previous studies zhou et al 2006 the mean annual precipitation is about 1678 mm of which nearly 80 falls in the hot humid season from april to september and the remainder in the dry season from october to march soils in dbr are classified as ultisols according to the usda soil taxonomy soil survey staff 1999 the model simulation period covered the three year observational period august 2009 december 2012 soil temperature and swc at 10 cm depth were measured by a digital thermometer and a mpkit ict international armidale nsw australia respectively tang et al 2006 the swc was converted to soil water potential swp using a soil water retention curve characterized by the van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 monthly n deposition rates were measured from 2009 to 2012 the average total wet dry nh4 and no3 deposition rates were 2 1 and 1 2 g n m 2 yr 1 respectively soil respiration was measured using the li 8100 automated soil co2 flux system li cor inc lincoln ne usa microbial biomass c and n were determined by the fumigation extraction method wu et al 1990 ammonium and nitrate were extracted with 2 m kcl and determined with a flow injection analysis automated ion

somcn mbcn and extractable nh4 and no3 concentrations the model calibration period covered from august 2009 to december 2012 we used the modified shuffled complex evolution sce algorithm to implement

examine soil c n responses to different smrfs and forcing data the first set scenario f0 f4 see table 6 was designed to explore if different smrfs would result in significant differences in modeling results we assigned different smrfs to pomo decomposition pomh and mom decomposition microbial mortality dormancy and resuscitation table 6 we conducted long term mend simulations beyond the calibration period 2009 2012 by repeatedly using the dynamic forcing data from the calibration period we calculated the mean concentrations of soc mineral n i e mn nh4 no3 active microbial biomass c active mbc after the model reached the dynamic steady state we then calculated the active fraction of microbial biomass active mbc under each scenario percent change in soc δsoc and mineral n δmn relative to the soc and mn under baseline scenario f0 the second set scenario d0 d4 see table 7 was to investigate if model simulations with constant time invariant data litter input soil temperature and moisture would be different from those with dynamic time variant data the constant and dynamic data for modeling are shown in fig 3 we first run the model with scenario d0 i e constant litter input soil temperature and moisture see table 7 to reach the steady state following which we then run mend under scenario d1 d4 table 7 to reach a new dynamic steady state we then calculated active mbc and active mbc under each scenario and δsoc and δmn relative to the socss and mnss under baseline scenario d0 here we asked whether there would be significant changes between simulations driven by constant and dynamic data whereas we did not intend to provide accurate estimates for the steady state c and n contents such as socss and mnss the reason is that the first steady state in all scenarios was determined by model calibration and simulations with constant data i e litter input soil temperature and moisture followed by which a new steady state was achieved by varying one of the data categories scenario d1 d3 or varying all data d4 the third set of experiments table 8 was to examine whether the effects of litter addition on soil c and n would be different when constant scenario l0 or dynamic scenario l1 data litter input n deposition soil temperature and moisture were used for each of the two scenarios we designed two treatments a control treatment with observed litter input rate mean rate for scenario l0 and time variant rate for scenario l1 and a litter addition treatment with 11 more litter input than the control treatment regarding scenario l0 we first run the model with constant data to reach the steady state we then run mend with litter addition i e by 11 as described in wang et al 2019 to reach a new steady state as per scenario l1 with dynamic data we also run mend with litter addition 11 to reach a new dynamic steady state following the first steady state achieved by dynamic data for each scenario with constant or dynamic data δsoc and δmn were calculated as the percent changes in socss and mnss between the two steady states i e the two treatments litter addition vs control 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration with n data we have shown good performances in simulating rh and mbc by the c only mend model in previous study wang et al 2019 our calibration of the c n coupled mend model also achieved good agreement between simulated and observed somcn mbcn nh4 and no3 concentrations fig 4 the simulated mean somcn was 13 8 which was only 6 higher than the observed value fig 4a the simulated daily data during 2009 2012 showed mbcn between 5 9 and 7 6 and the mean mbcn was consistent with the observed mbcn fig 4a the simulated mbcn 7 data points exhibited a much smaller variation than the observations mostly because there was one measurement of mbcn 13 8 in august 2011 which was much higher than the other 6 observed mbcn values 4 5 7 7 in addition the simulated soil nh4 and no3 concentrations also agreed well with the observations with no3 exhibiting a larger variation in model simulations than in observations fig 4b we did not explicitly simulate no3 leaching and plant uptake of nh4 and no3 as no data were available for validation however our nitrification and denitrification simulations implicitly included these fluxes since we constrained the model by using observed somcn mbcn nh4 or no3 concentrations in addition to rh and mbc 3 2 soil microbes and c n in response to different soil moisture response functions smrfs in fig 5 a we showed the percent changes in soc δsoc and mineral n δmn under scenario f1 f4 with different smrfs relative to the soc and mn under baseline scenario f0 with default smrfs without consideration of the soil moisture effects on microbial dormancy and resuscitation scenario f1 in table 6 the steady state soc socss would increase significantly by 226 compared to the baseline scenario f0 socss fig 5a no smrfs to modify microbial dormancy and resuscitation rates also resulted in negative change in mineral n concentration δmn 7 this could be explained by the lowest active mbc and active mbc under scenario f1 among all scenarios consequently resulting in the lowest microbial and enzyme activities and the accumulation of soc under scenario f1 the low active mbc and som decomposition rate under scenario f1 further led to less net n mineralization fluxes by 35 and reduced mineral n when soil moisture effect was not considered for microbial dormancy and reactivation under scenario f1 substrate i e doc limitation became dominant and caused higher dormancy rates than resuscitation rates in early stage of the simulation period ultimately resulting in low active mbc and active mbc in other word when soil moisture effect was combined with the effect of substrate availability it could lead to higher resuscitation rates than dormancy rates under wet conditions which alleviated the single substrate limiting effect to some extent scenario f0 there were no changes in soc mn and active mbc when the same smrf eq 43 was applied to both oxidative and hydrolytic decomposition processes scenario f2 fig 5a this was expected due to all observed swp values in the study site being lower than 0 003 mpa or swc 0 494 fig 3c which was not able to cause significant effects on soil microbial and c n dynamics between the two smrfs shown in fig 2a we anticipated there might be changes in soil c n under scenario f2 if the soil moisture data could cover the range beyond greater than 0 003 mpa in fig 2a because saturation of soil moisture would depress the activity of oxidative enzymes due to oxygen limitation freeman et al 2001 a single smrf like eq 43 has often been used to modify the decomposition rates of all soil c pools liang 2019 oleson 2013 partly due to the generally low occurrence probability for extremely high or low soil moisture as well as the difficulty in differentiating the soil moisture effects between multiple decomposition processes we also found significant increases in socss when the function 1 fsm2 fsm2 denotes eq 43 was assigned to microbial mortality and dormancy and the function fsm2 assigned to microbial resuscitation scenario f3 and f4 fig 5a however these positive effects were much smaller than the effect by scenario f1 owing to the active mbc concentrations and microbial activities under scenario f3 and f4 were lower than those under f0 but higher than those under f1 the above analyses in terms of different smrfs indicated that the selection of smrfs could lead to significant differences in model simulations of soil microbial and c n processes particularly remarkable differences in soil c and n cycling could occur between with and without accounting for the soil moisture effects on microbial dormancy and resuscitation scenario f1 vs f0 in fig 5a as microbial physiological states will switch under favorable or stressful environmental conditions bär et al 2002 stolpovsky et al 2011 wang et al 2019 3 3 constant versus dynamic litter input soil temperature or moisture among the four scenarios d1 d4 with constant and or dynamic data litter input soil temperature and moisture only the scenarios with dynamic soil moisture caused significant changes in socss and mnss compared to those under the baseline scenario d0 with constant litter input soil temperature and moisture fig 5b the δsoc was 73 and 88 under scenario d3 dynamic soil moisture and d4 dynamic litter input soil temperature and moisture respectively our results showed that under scenarios d0 d2 without soil moisture dynamics active mbc and active mbc were almost the same with nearly all microbes being active active mbc 98 due to no water stress when the constant swc 0 253 was used for modeling however dynamic soil moisture resulted in lower active mbc and more reasonable active mbc 31 and consequently reduced microbial and enzyme activities further leading to the accumulation of soc though the net n mineralization flux decreased by 12 relative to scenario d0 there was still an accumulation of mineral n 36 under scenario d3 and d4 due to reduced n loss via denitrification the above analyses implied that the utilization of field observed dynamic time variant data particularly dynamic soil moisture could result in dynamic microbial community and physiology subsequently leading to substantially different soil c and n processes this was further evidenced by direct comparisons between experimental observations and model simulations driven by constant or dynamic data fig 6 the simulated rh agreed well with the observations r2 0 68 during 2009 2012 when the model was driven by dynamic ltw dynamic litter input soil temperature and moisture fig 6a when constant litter input was used the simulated rh values were similar to those by dynamic ltw with a little bit lower r2 0 63 when constant soil temperature was used higher discrepancies exhibited between simulated and observed rh r2 0 54 in which high rh fluxes were generally underestimated in addition most of the rh fluxes were greatly overestimated by the model driven by constant soil moistures fig 6a consistent mbc results were modeled no matter what constant or dynamic litter input or soil temperature data were employed fig 6b however the utilization of constant soil moisture resulted in significant overestimates of mbc fig 6b which elucidated the overestimated rh fluxes fig 6a our results indicated that seasonal variations in soil moisture play an important role in regulating microbial and c n cycling it is possible that significant differences would also appear when dynamic litter input or temperature data from other study sites were used which conveys the same message that dynamic versus constant data may result in completely different modeling results even when the same model structure is used 3 4 dynamics versus constant data result in different responses to litter addition when constant data litter input n deposition soil temperature and moisture were used to drive model simulations litter addition 11 caused positive effects on both soc 11 and mineral n 7 however with dynamic data as the driving force litter addition average of 11 resulted in insignificant change in soc 2 p value greater than 0 05 but significant negative response in mineral n 9 fig 7 we didn t see a significant increase in microbial biomass or active biomass likely because almost all microbes 98 had already become active due to no environmental stress when constant forcing data were used as a result the microbial and enzyme activity didn t change under litter addition finally leading to the accumulation of soc and mineral n on the contrary there was an 58 increase in active mbc under dynamic data and litter addition which led to higher microbial and enzyme activities and ultimately unchanged soc though both net n mineralization and denitrification slightly increased by 0 8 and 0 5 respectively net mineral n loss was found when dynamic data were used due to the denitrification flux being higher than the sum of n deposition and net n mineralization in brief the responses of soil c and n to litter addition could be qualitatively different when constant or dynamic data were used to drive model simulations our results highlighted the necessity to account for the seasonality of environmental factors for a better understanding of priming effects in field conditions priming effects often refer to the changes in the som decomposition caused by the addition of organic or mineral substrates such as fresh litter root exudates and fertilizer blagodatskaya and kuzyakov 2008 in addition interventions such as drying and wetting could also contribute to priming effects kuzyakov et al 2000 both positive and negative soc responses to litter addition have been observed in short and long term experiments lajtha et al 2014a lajtha et al 2014b pisani et al 2016 sulman et al 2018 when time invariant data were employed to drive model simulations we found a negative priming effect leading to the accumulation of soc on the contrary we showed a positive priming effect i e more native soc loss via co2 with litter addition in this old broadleaf forest when dynamic data were used in our previous study on a different forest young pine forest in the same area we demonstrated a negative priming effect by the modeling with seasonal data these experimental and modeling results imply that differential priming effects could appear in different ecosystems under similar or distinct environmental conditions due to the complicated mechanisms for the changes in soil microbial community and activity in response to substrate additions and or environmental change 4 conclusions the c n coupled mend modeling regarding different smrfs indicated that the selection of smrfs for specific biogeochemical processes could result in distinct differences in model simulations of soil microbial and c n processes in particular it is essential to accounting for the soil moisture effects on microbial dormancy and resuscitation as the changes in microbial physiology under favorable or stressful conditions will exert strong controls on soil c and n dynamics without consideration of the soil moisture effects on microbial dormancy and resuscitation the steady state soc socss would increase significantly compared to the baseline socss whereas mineral n concentration would decrease among the four scenarios with constant and or dynamic data only the scenarios with dynamic soil moisture caused significant changes in socss and mnss compared to those under the baseline scenario with constant data we also show that the responses of soil c and n to litter addition could be qualitatively different when constant or dynamic data were used to drive model simulations therefore we advocate the utilization of dynamic data instead of time invariant data to drive model simulations and analyses dynamic forcing data from measurements or reanalysis better represent the real world climate and environmental conditions which could facilitate more realistic modeling and understanding of soil c and nutrient cycling in a changing world declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

5539,soil moisture retention is an important environmental factor that controls water availability in agro ecosystems comprehensive information on spatial distribution and patterns of soil properties controlling moisture retention such as organic carbon oc clay content and saturation percentage sp are crucial for effective land management and sustainable development this study seeks to employ two data mining algorithms named multivariate adaptive regression splines mars and gene expression programming gep as predictive models in digital soil mapping dsm and quantify the associated uncertainty at a grid resolution of 30 m using satellite based covariates for each model the features selected based on their interior algorithm during the training of the models the performance and accuracy of mars and gep were evaluated through nine statistical quantitative and graphical criteria including mean error me mean absolute error mae root mean squared error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 relative rmse rmse taylor diagram scatter curve fitting and point density plots for each model the prediction maps of soil properties and their associated uncertainty maps were generated the results revealed that mars outperformed gep in providing predictions with superior performance and accuracy moreover mars performed better in showing the spatial distributions and patterns of all the studied soil properties in addition the mars model produced less prediction uncertainty and can predict soil moisture retention properties more accurately this study highlights the key role of data mining numerical modeling algorithms as predictive models in dsm toward the most accurate predictions moreover the study expressed the capabilities of remote sensing derived data in predicting complex soil properties this study opened a new research line for accurate dsm keywords dsm organic carbon saturation percentage clay mars gep 1 introduction soil moisture is the most important source of water for agriculture and vegetation covers soil moisture is the main component in the hydrological cycle responsible for biological processes dobriyal et al 2012 carbon cycling falloon et al 2011 nutrient cycling and accessibility dobriyal et al 2012 rasaei and bogaert 2019 therefore soil moisture has a direct impact on agricultural production dobriyal et al 2012 and is linked to water and food security rasaei and bogaert 2019 soil moisture retention has a direct relationship to basic soil physico chemical properties such as organic matter om soil texture and bulk density minasny and mcbratney 2018 rawls et al 2003 scheinost et al 1997 the information about soil moisture retention is needed in agronomy ecology and various soil related studies because it controls soil functioning in ecosystems and affects soil management rawls et al 2003 high soil moisture retention is marked as an important ecosystem service conversely its mismanagement leads to desertification hassan et al 2005 therefore water availability in agro ecosystems is depending on soil moisture retention power 2010 most arid and semi arid regions suffer from inadequate and unreliable precipitation anschütz et al 2003 consequently soil moisture management is crucial for sustainable agriculture in these regions rasaei and bogaert 2019 accordingly estimating soil moisture retention properties in these regions can lead to the correct determination of appropriate cropping pattern for each area which is a major step towards the achievement of sustainable agriculture in arid and semi arid regions hence we need detailed adequate and complete information on spatial distribution and patterns of the parameters affecting the soil moisture retention such as soil organic carbon oc saturation percentage sp clay

improve the quality and spatial resolution of soil maps keesstra et al 2016 hengl et al 2014 indeed to achieve sustainable agriculture reliable and accurate high spatial resolution maps are needed to locally analyze the spatial variations of different parameters and detect their spatial patterns over the area forkuor et al 2017 here the critical roles of digital soil mapping dsm and remote sensing as its essential element is highlighted dsm is a technique for quantitative mapping of soil properties mcbratney et al 2003 minasny and mcbratney 2016 and remote sensing is the most important provider of covariates for precise soil mapping dsm uses filed observations environmental variables digital elevation model dem and remote sensing imageries as inputs for building mathematical models to relate soil observations data with their environmental remote sensing covariates to map the spatial patterns of soil properties through space minasny and mcbratney 2016 remote sensing spectral features have

for improvement of dsm predictive models by employing new mathematical numerical modeling techniques this in turn will open a new way for accurate dsm for instance the potential of data mining

of yet scarce studies have been specifically carried out to quantitatively map the soil moisture retention parameters since the complex relations between these properties and environmental factors in this regard these properties can be modeled using nonlinear and local data mining algorithms like mars and gep reliable and accurate digital soil mapping is one of the most important issues in climatic and eco hydrological modeling these studies need high resolution maps of soil properties with low uncertainties ma et al 2017 uncertainty analysis is critical for presenting the reliability of the predictive models in dsm minasny and mcbratney 2002 accordingly dsm practice should provide maps of prediction and associated uncertainty arrouays et al 2014 padarian et al 2019 various methods

malone et al 2017 the objectives of this study are as follows 1 investigating the capability of mars and gep techniques as predictive models in dsm of soil moisture retention properties such as oc sp and clay content in semi arid region by using solely satellite based data 2 using these models to generate oc sp and clay content maps and 3 assessing and quantifying the prediction uncertainties for

latitude 37 56 to 38 16 n and longitude 45 49 to 46 13 e with the area of 701 km2 70114 ha fig 1 the climate of the area is semi arid jeihouni et al 2018 with an average annual precipitation of 280 mm

mars was introduced by friedman 1991 as a flexible procedure to organize relationships that are nearly additive or involve interactions with fewer variables mars is a nonparametric non linear and data driven regression algorithm capable to simulate the non linear relationships between a set of predictor variables here covariates and the response variable it does not have any assumption about the underlying functional relationship between response and predictor variables to determine the general functions of high dimensional arguments friedman 1991 cheng and cao 2014 mars is a powerful and suitable algorithm for solving complex problems with high input dimensions because it employs a divide and conquer strategy the training dataset covariate space is divided into various separate regions and individual splines with different slopes were fitted to each region the splines are completely connected and these one dimensional piecewise linear polynomials are called basis functions bfs result in a flexible model that can simulate both linear and nonlinear behaviors zhang and goh 2016 knots are the connection points between bfs the main advantages of mars are 1 capability to discover the complicated data mapping in high dimensional data patterns and make simpler and robust models that are easier to interpret 2 ability to analyze the variables contributions and their relative importance and 3 processing speed zhang and goh 2016 fig 2 shows a simple schematic presentation of how the mars algorithm works and employs piecewise linear spline functions to fit the data patterns for specific detail on mathematics theories and applications of mars the readers can refer to friedman 1991 hastie et al 2009 zhang and goh 2016 kuter et al 2018 2 3 gep gep is an evolutionary algorithm invented by ferreira 2001a b and used as a powerful approach for modeling nonlinear and complex relations ferreira 2001b power et al 2019 genes compose of a head and a tail the head contains symbols characterize both functions and terminals while the tail contains only terminals ferreira 2001b a chromosome expression tree et structure in gep can contain one or more genes known as a sub expression tree sub et the best solution multi subunit et is reached by linking interacts and link sub ets by algebraic or boolean functions each sub et is a part of the best solution and has less complexity than related et mehr 2018 for specific detail on theories and application of gep the readers can refer to ferreira 2001a b 2006 emamgolizadeh et al 2015 there are some critical steps in gep models setup which are determining the sets of terminals covariates and the sets of functions mathematical functions to create the chromosomes in this study the mentioned set with 19 functions nominated from all the accessible functions in gep to be used which including four basic arithmetic operators i e and some basic mathematical functions i e sin cos tan arcsin arccos arctan ln x log exp power the functions selected regarding easiness and their relevance to the nature of the problem which presents reasonable gep models samadianfard et al 2018 for each chromosome seven or eight genes were used with addition as a linking function ferreira 2001a b the setups of the training parameters of the gep models are summarized in table 1 2 4 feature selection when it comes to feature selection in modeling studies researchers point out that the data dimensionality should be decreased to allow the models to operate more effectively taghizadeh mehrjardi et al 2016a in this regard many classic and heuristic methods were used for feature selection such as expert knowledge sharififar et al 2019 correlation based technique subburayalu et al 2014 taghizadeh mehrjardi et al 2016b stepwise linear regression sr wang et al 2018a genetic algorithms ga taghizadeh mehrjardi et al 2016a wang et al 2018a yang et al 2019 ant colony optimization aco taghizadeh mehrjardi et al 2016b and artificial bee colony abc taghizadeh mehrjardi et al 2017 these methods select variables completely isolated from the applied predictive models and afterward use selected variables as inputs so they neglected the models assumptions and capabilities for instance as presented in schematic example fig 2 in section 2 2 the correlation between x and y variable is nearly zero if linear model fitted to determine correlation here variable selection methods will put the x aside because it can t model the complexity of y however the mars model can easily use this variable for predicting y consequently feature selection should be based on the applied model to take benefits of models capabilities in simulating the complexity of the target variable and allow the model to select efficient features during the training phase the feature selection in mars and gep is based on their interior algorithms during the training of the model the feature selection in mars is based on the pruning of bfs the selected features of mars are those predictors that have survived the backward phase pruning of bfs and contributed to the final mars model gep selects the features which have contributed in chromosomes of the final et these feature selection strategies in mars and gep are very powerful tools for feature selection 2 5 model evaluation and performance analyze the accuracy of the two algorithms for each of the soil moisture retention properties was validated through the leave one out cross validation loocv technique cawley and talbot 2003 loocv is a branch of cross validation techniques practical where the amount of available data is insufficient to create the training and testing subsets cawley and talbot 2003 caro gutiérrez et al 2019 loocv makes optimum use of all available data since each observation used both as training and validation consecutively this technique frequently mentioned regarding its ability in providing an almost unbiased estimation cawley and talbot 2003 as cases like this study where the number of observations is limited sor et al 2017 in such cases just a small perturbation of the training data substantially affects the fitted model cawley and talbot 2003 this highlights the capability of loocv strategy which minimizes the perturbation to the data in each trial the fitted models were assessed using four standard statistical criteria named mean error me mean absolute error mae root mean squared error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 that can be calculated as follows rossel and behrens 2010 taghizadeh mehrjardi et al 2014 shahabi et al 2017 1 me 1 n i 1 n z x oi z x pi 2 mae 1 n i 1 n z x oi z x pi 3 rmse 1 n i 1 n z x oi z x pi 2 4 r 2 i 1 n z x oi z x o z x pi z x p i 1 n z x oi z x o 2 i 1 n z x pi z x p 2 2 where n is the number of observed data z x o i and z x p i are observed and predicted target variables respectively to have a better comparison of prediction accuracy the relative rmse rmse exploited to compare models accuracy in predicting studied soil properties this dimensionless criterion allows comparing the accuracy of different variables with different ranges rmse is calculated as park and vlek 2002 5 rmse rmse z x o moreover the taylor diagram taylor 2001 and point density plot were employed as a further diagnostic tools to analyze the performance and accuracy of mars and gep models predictions a taylor diagram is a graphic depiction of the observed and estimated data which presents several characteristics of the predicted and observed values simultaneously it can illustrate and quantify the degree of correspondence between modeled and observed in terms of three statistical criteria correlation coefficient r standard deviation sd and rmse in a single diagram in the taylor diagram the closer model to the observation point in the diagram has the higher predictive performance khosravi et al 2018 2 6 uncertainty analysis in the modeling process model inputs observed data and covariate information model parameters and model structure are the three main potential sources of the model output uncertainty minasny and mcbratney 2002 malone et al 2017 arrouays et al 2014 accordingly the model output comprises all sources of uncertainty in this study the uncertainty treated based on the model output errors to assess the uncertainty of the predictions the 90 prediction interval pi derived from n number of fitted models n is the number of contributing data which is 69 during the loocv phase malone et al 2016 for mars and gep for each fitted model during iterations the prediction map prediction realization was generated and the variance of prediction realizations for each pixel was estimated then the prediction interval width piw was defined by estimating the 90 upper and lower prediction limits padarian et al 2017 the result is a map of 90 piw at each 30 m pixel which is used as criteria to evaluate the prediction uncertainty over the study area shahbazi et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 descriptive statistics descriptive statistics of soil moisture retention parameters are summarized in table 2 the mean oc sp and clay were 0 61 44 73 and 29 01 respectively oc ranged from 0 15 to 2 48 sp ranged from 20 7 to 59 09 and clay ranged from 4 8 to 64 4 the coefficient of variation cv results indicates that sp and oc had the lowest and highest variations respectively cv ranged from 20 21 to 55 73 for soil moisture retention properties variability of soil properties could be categorized based on wilding 1985 cv 16 low variability 16 cv 36 moderate variability and cv 36 high variability accordingly oc and clay showed high variability while sp had moderate variability skewness and kurtosis results indicated that oc and sp were not normally distributed except clay which had a nearly normal distribution but normality is not important for mars and gep due to their non parametric nature 3 2 model performance the models validated using loocv method based on me mae rmse and r2 the validation results are showed in table 3 and graphically presented in figs 3 and 4 based on me results mars had zero me error for oc sp and clay while gep prediction me for these properties were 0 01 0 24 and 0 50 respectively the negative value of me for sp using gep indicates gep model under estimate target sp values in other performance statistics such as mae and rmse the mars model had a low amount of errors in predicting all studied properties the scatter plots between observed and predicted values for soil oc sp and clay by mars and gep models are presented in fig 4 which shows r2 direction type and strength of the relations moreover for each prediction the upper and lower limits of the 95 prediction intervals are determined the comparison between predictions r2 values mars outperformed gep in the modeling of soil oc sp and clay with r2 of 0 85 0 72 and 0 67 respectively fig 4 indicates that the mars model provides a close linearly fitted line to the 1 1 line therefore mars predicted values are in better agreement with observed compared to gep for all studied soil properties regarding table 3 and fig 3 the highest and lowest performance was belonged to mars in predicting oc and gep in predicting clay respectively for better compression on the performance of mars and gep algorithms the curve fitting charts are presented in fig 5 in these charts the predicted values for soil properties from models were plotted and compared to those of the observed at the validation stage in oc prediction mars and gep could relatively predict fit high oc contents and both models predictions were slightly under performed in lower oc contents in sp prediction the models couldn t fit the highest and lowest sp values but mars provide closer prediction compared to those of gep in clay perditions gep could fit the highest clay content of 64 4 but none of the models were able to predict the lowest value of 4 8 except for the highest point mars predictions are close to observed values fig 5 demonstrates that mars generally fitted the curve better than gep in all studied soil properties additionally the distribution of observed and predicted values using mars and gep for soil oc sp and clay is presented as density plots in fig 6 density plots illustrate the difference in the distribution pattern of predicted and observed values in terms of range and density results revealed that in all soil properties prediction the mars density and distribution patterns were similar to those of observed data than gep gep model has predicted target values in certain domains and it leads to dense distribution patterns of points in some ranges compared to observed values and mars gep predicted targets had higher residuals compared to mars the results of the density plots are in accordance with the results of the regression and curve fitting to provide further discussion taylor diagrams employed to visually compare the capability of mars and gep models performance taylor considers sd r and rmse values between observed and predicted soil oc sp and clay for the mars and gep models taylor 2001 fig 7 expresses taylor diagrams for implemented models a superior model is identified by a reference point with r of 1 and the same sd compared to of observations consequently the closest point to the green point has superior performance and accuracy according to the taylor diagrams it is evident that the mars algorithm a red colored point presents superior predictions for soil oc sp and clay compared to gep taylor diagrams have supported the results of regression curve fitting and density plots and highly confirm that mars has a higher capability in simulating complex relationships between remote sensing derived covariates and soil moisture retention properties to predict them the results highlight that the mars algorithm outperformed gep in providing better and more accurate results 3 3 prediction accuracy the calculated rmse for mars and gep models are summarized and visually presented in fig 8 results revealed that the highest and lowest prediction accuracies were belonged to sp and clay using mars and gep models respectively in regards to comparing the accuracy of the implemented models the rmse values for mars were always lower than gep in other words mars provides results with the highest prediction accuracy for predicting soil moisture retention properties hengl et al 2004 describe rmse values close to 40 as fairly satisfactory prediction accuracy values higher than 71 as unacceptable unsatisfactory prediction regarding this classification both models were able to predict soil moisture retention properties with satisfactory accuracies however mars present superior predictions in all studied soil properties according to section 3 2 the highest and lowest performance was belonged to oc and clay predictions using mars and gep models the rmse results indicate that the highest and lowest prediction accuracies were belonged to mars in predicting sp and gep in predicting clay respectively as presented in fig 6 mars predicted sp values had a better coverage with observed values among other predictions the results exposed that the best performed model may not necessarily lead to the most accurate prediction as presented in tables 2 oc sp and clay are in different ranges and sp had the highest mean and lowest cv compared to oc and clay accordingly sp had the lowest variability and its predictions by both models provided the least relative rmse 3 4 variables of importance among all of the utilized environmental and remote sensing derived covariates band1 5 7 pc1 pc4 brightness wetness greenness ndvi ndsi savi sbr elevation slope and x and y coordinates were important covariates in predicting soil moisture retention properties the detail results of the importance of the variables in predicting oc sp and clay by mars and gep is presented in fig 9 for instance band1 2 and 5 for mars and y coordinate brightness and savi for gep were the most effective covariates in oc prediction according to fig 9 the x and y coordinates were important geographical covariates responsible for predicting soil moistures retention properties using applied techniques the importance of these covariates indicates spatial trends in studied soil properties the results showed the contribution of wetness in predicting oc and clay using both techniques generally moisture capacity is relatively high in soil with quite high clay content and this moisture can support plant growth and lead to higher oc 3 5 spatial prediction fig 10 shows prediction maps of soil moisture retention properties prediction maps of oc mars predicted higher values in center and southwest and the lower amounts in northern western and eastern parts of the area but gep predicted oc values in lower ranges and present oc content in light green over the area this caused regarding low prediction capability of gep as demonstrated in fig 6 the gep model predicted target oc values in certain domains around 0 5 and predicted values were not cover the observed domain figs 4 and 6 therefore the gep model produced a map in which the prediction values were around 0 5 as observable in fig 10 prediction maps of sp mars predict lower values in northwest and southeast parts and areas with higher sp are located in the northeast center and southwest of the area this is highly matched with the oc mars map which indicated that in areas with high oc high sp is observable gep predicted lower sp values in north west and southeastern parts gep predictions were in middle range values and couldn t predict the lowest and highest values of sp prediction maps of clay mars predict lower clay content in north northwest northeast south and southeastern parts these areas are boundaries of the plain that are closer to mountainous areas but in the east west southwest and central areas high clay contents are predicted which are located in the center of the plain and are far from the mountainous areas higher clay content in the central and lowest part of plains has two reasons 1 soil texture gets finer as altitude drops and 2 clay transportation from highland and its re depositionin plain caused by floods and runoffs during the time gep model predicted higher clay content in central parts as well but it predicts clay content in the middle range 15 40 of observed values according to all generated maps oc sp and clay have higher values in central and western parts of the plain with the lowest elevation which validated by the effect of elevation and terrain characteristics on the variability of moisture retention properties the mars algorithm was able to extract the spatial patterns of oc sp and clay better than gep overall mars performed better in illustrating the spatial distribution of all studied soil properties based on mars predicted maps the sp spatial pattern was similar to oc and clay these similarities between the spatial distribution of sp with oc and clay confirmed that sp presumably governed by oc and clay content 3 6 uncertainty quantifying the uncertainty of the prediction maps is essential and confirms their applicability for managerial decision making procedures the piw maps that were calculated using the estimated upper and lower prediction limits of soil moisture retention properties for mars and gep models are presented in fig 11 the generated uncertainty maps highlighted the problematic areas and facilitated the interpretation of the models accuracies the spatial pattern of the piw for the dsm reveals the differences in the magnitude of uncertainty attributed to each property and model generally gep predicted maps had a higher uncertainty and piw values in all parts compared to mars regarding its under estimation behavior the highest piw were observed generally in central and southern parts as presented in table 4 the mean prediction interval width mpiw values indicate that the accuracy and precision of mars predictions are higher than gep for oc sp and clay the gep provided wider piw for all studied soil properties compared to mars the highest and lowest mpiw are belonged to gep in predicting clay and mars in predicting oc respectively uncertainty of oc prediction mars has the highest and lowest uncertainty in the southwest and central parts of the area respectively gep has higher uncertainty in all parts compared to mars however the uncertainty is high in the north east southeast south southwest and west of the area uncertainty of sp prediction both of the prediction maps had the lowest uncertainty in northwest and southeast of the area the high uncertainty observed in the eastern central and western parts the highest piw in predicting sp has belonged to gep which observed in the center southwest and west of the study area uncertainty of clay prediction the highest and lowest piw values for mars were observed in the central and northern parts of the area respectively gep prediction has the highest uncertainty in the west center and east of the area both mars and gep had higher uncertainty in central parts compared to other parts 3 7 future works this research presents a pathway to start further studies on the application of data mining or other numerical modeling algorithms as predictive models in dsm 4 conclusion in the current study two data mining techniques named mars and gep are employed as predictive models in dsm these models were applied to investigate their feasibility in predicting soil moisture retention properties such as oc sp and clay moreover several remote sensing based covariates were used to predict target variables the models performance and accuracy were evaluated based on statistical and graphical approaches the spatial distribution maps of all studied soil properties were generated by mars and gep along with their associated uncertainty maps this study highlights the role of data mining numerical modeling algorithms as predictive models in dsm the results opened a new research line for accurate dsm the main findings of the study can be concluded as 1 the combined remote sensing data and powerful numerical models enable predicting spatial patterns of soil moistures retention properties 2 the x and y coordinates were important geographical covariates responsible for predicting soil moistures properties using applied techniques 3 the mars outperformed the gep algorithm based on five statistical metrics and four graphic approaches in all predictions 4 mars model has a higher predictive power and processing speed whereas gep has lower performance and require a higher run time 5 mars performed better in showing the patterns and spatial distribution of all studied soil properties 6 mars produced less prediction uncertainty and provided accurate prediction maps using fewer covariates than gep credit authorship

water for agriculture and vegetation covers soil moisture is the main component in the hydrological cycle responsible for biological processes dobriyal et al 2012 carbon cycling falloon et al 2011 nutrient cycling and accessibility dobriyal et al 2012 rasaei and bogaert 2019 therefore soil moisture has a direct impact on agricultural production dobriyal et al 2012 and is linked to water and food security rasaei and bogaert 2019 soil moisture retention has a direct relationship to basic soil physico chemical properties such as organic matter om soil texture and bulk density minasny and mcbratney 2018 rawls et al 2003 scheinost et al 1997 the information about soil moisture retention is needed in agronomy ecology and various soil related studies because it controls soil functioning in ecosystems and affects soil management rawls et al 2003 high soil moisture retention is marked as an important ecosystem service conversely its mismanagement leads to desertification hassan et al 2005 therefore water availability in agro ecosystems is depending on soil moisture retention power 2010 most arid and semi arid regions suffer from inadequate and unreliable precipitation anschütz et al 2003 consequently soil moisture management is crucial for sustainable agriculture in these regions rasaei and bogaert 2019 accordingly estimating soil moisture retention properties in these regions can lead to the correct determination of appropriate cropping pattern for each area which is a major step towards the achievement of sustainable agriculture in arid and semi arid regions hence we need detailed adequate and complete information on spatial distribution and patterns of the parameters affecting the soil moisture retention such as soil organic carbon oc saturation percentage sp clay content soil structure and other determinant characteristics soil maps are necessary for decision makers and are broadly used as fundamental information for land use planning management agricultural management natural protections and environmental and hydrological modelling van der ploeg and vlijm 1978 cámara et al 2017 forkuor et al 2017 pinheiro et al 2018 and in recent years there is a need to improve the quality and spatial resolution of soil maps keesstra et al 2016 hengl et al 2014 indeed to achieve sustainable agriculture reliable and accurate high spatial resolution maps are needed to locally analyze the spatial variations of different parameters and detect their spatial patterns over the area forkuor et al 2017 here the critical roles of digital soil mapping dsm and remote sensing as its essential element is highlighted dsm is a technique for quantitative mapping of soil properties mcbratney et al 2003 minasny and mcbratney 2016 and remote sensing is the most important provider of covariates for precise soil mapping dsm uses filed observations environmental variables digital elevation model dem and remote sensing imageries as inputs for building mathematical models to relate soil observations data with their environmental remote sensing covariates to map the spatial patterns of soil properties through space minasny and mcbratney 2016 remote sensing spectral features have been successfully employed as covariates along with environmental variables in dsm as addressed in numerous researches for mapping of soil total nitrogen wang et al 2017b wang et al 2018b texture

2019 for mapping soil texture fractions oc and sp regarding previous studies it seems that the commonly used predictive models in dsm do not provide highly accurate predictions so there is still room for improvement of dsm predictive models by employing new mathematical numerical modeling techniques this in turn will open a new way for accurate dsm for instance the potential of data mining techniques such as multivariate adaptive regression splines mars and gene expression programming gep as predictive models in dsm can be investigated the mars and gep are non parametric regression

samadianfard et al 2018 monthly reference et mattar 2018 and wave runup power et al 2019 up to the author s knowledge the application of mars and gep in dsm have not been addressed in any research as of yet scarce studies have been specifically carried out to quantitatively map the soil moisture retention parameters since the complex relations between these properties and environmental factors in this regard these properties can be modeled using nonlinear and local data mining algorithms like mars and gep reliable and accurate digital soil mapping is one of the most important issues in climatic and eco hydrological modeling these studies need high resolution maps of soil properties with low uncertainties ma et al 2017 uncertainty analysis is critical for presenting the reliability of the predictive models in dsm minasny and mcbratney 2002 accordingly dsm practice should provide maps of prediction and associated uncertainty arrouays et al 2014 padarian et al 2019 various methods have been proposed for quantifying the prediction uncertainties such as error propagation rules rudiyanto et al 2018 bootstrapping zhou et al 2019 empirical uncertainty quantification through fuzzy clustering and cross validation ma et al 2017 universal kriging prediction variance szatmári and pásztor 2019 and empirical uncertainty quantification through data partitioning and cross validation malone et al 2017 the objectives of this study are as follows 1 investigating the capability of mars and gep techniques as predictive models in dsm of soil moisture retention properties such as oc sp and clay content in semi arid region by using solely satellite based data 2 using these models to generate oc sp and clay content maps and 3 assessing and quantifying the prediction uncertainties for the created digital maps at a raster resolution of 30 m 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and dataset the study area is part of tabriz plain situated in the north west of iran and located between latitude 37 56 to 38 16 n and longitude 45 49 to 46 13 e with the area of 701 km2 70114 ha fig 1 the climate of the area is semi arid jeihouni et al 2018 with an average annual precipitation of 280 mm

mars was introduced by friedman 1991 as a flexible procedure to organize relationships that are nearly additive or involve interactions with fewer variables mars is a nonparametric non linear and data driven regression algorithm capable to simulate the non linear relationships between a set of predictor variables here covariates and the response variable it does not have any assumption about the underlying functional relationship between response and predictor variables to determine the general functions of high dimensional arguments friedman 1991 cheng and cao 2014 mars is a powerful and suitable algorithm for solving complex problems with high input dimensions because it employs a divide and conquer strategy the training dataset covariate space is divided into various separate regions and individual splines with different slopes were fitted to each region the splines are completely connected and these one dimensional piecewise linear polynomials are called basis functions bfs result in a flexible model that can simulate both linear and nonlinear behaviors zhang and goh 2016 knots are the connection points between bfs the main advantages of mars are 1 capability to discover the complicated data mapping in high dimensional data patterns and make simpler and robust models that are easier to interpret 2 ability to analyze the variables contributions and their relative importance and 3 processing speed zhang and goh 2016 fig 2 shows a simple schematic presentation of how the mars algorithm works and employs piecewise linear spline functions to fit the data patterns for specific detail on mathematics theories and applications of mars the readers can refer to friedman 1991 hastie et al 2009 zhang and goh 2016 kuter et al 2018 2 3 gep gep is an evolutionary algorithm invented by ferreira 2001a b and used as a powerful approach for modeling nonlinear and complex relations ferreira 2001b power et al 2019 genes compose of a head and a tail the head contains symbols characterize both functions and terminals while the tail contains only terminals ferreira 2001b a chromosome expression tree et structure in gep can contain one or more genes known as a sub expression tree sub et the best solution multi subunit et is reached by linking interacts and link sub ets by algebraic or boolean functions each sub et is a part of the best solution and has less complexity than related et mehr 2018 for specific detail on theories and application of gep the readers can refer to ferreira 2001a b 2006 emamgolizadeh et al 2015 there are some critical steps in gep models setup which are determining the sets of terminals covariates and the sets of functions mathematical functions to create the chromosomes in this study the mentioned set with 19 functions nominated from all the accessible functions in gep to be used which including four basic arithmetic operators i e and some basic mathematical functions i e sin cos tan arcsin arccos arctan ln x log exp power the functions selected regarding easiness and their relevance to the nature of the problem which presents reasonable gep models samadianfard et al 2018 for each chromosome seven or eight genes were used with addition as a linking function ferreira 2001a b the setups of the training parameters of the gep models are summarized in table 1 2 4 feature selection when it comes to feature selection in modeling studies researchers point out that the data dimensionality should be decreased to allow the models to operate more effectively taghizadeh mehrjardi et al 2016a in this regard many classic and heuristic methods were used for feature selection such as expert knowledge sharififar et al 2019 correlation based technique subburayalu et al 2014 taghizadeh mehrjardi et al 2016b stepwise linear regression sr wang et al 2018a genetic algorithms ga taghizadeh mehrjardi et al 2016a wang et al 2018a yang et al 2019 ant colony optimization aco taghizadeh mehrjardi et al 2016b and artificial bee colony abc taghizadeh mehrjardi et al 2017 these methods select variables completely isolated from the applied predictive models and afterward use selected variables as inputs so they neglected the models assumptions and capabilities for instance as presented in schematic example fig 2 in section 2 2 the correlation between x and y variable is nearly zero if linear model fitted to determine correlation here variable selection methods will put the x aside because it can t model the complexity of y however the mars model can easily use this variable for predicting y consequently feature selection should be based on the applied model to take benefits of models capabilities in simulating the complexity of the target variable and allow the model to select efficient features during the training phase the feature selection in mars and gep is based on their interior algorithms during the training of the model the feature selection in mars is based on the pruning of bfs the selected features of mars are those predictors that have survived the backward phase pruning of bfs and contributed to the final mars model gep selects the features which have contributed in chromosomes of the final et these feature selection strategies in mars and gep are very powerful tools for feature selection 2 5 model evaluation and performance analyze the accuracy of the two algorithms for each of the soil moisture retention properties was validated through the leave one out cross validation loocv technique cawley and talbot 2003 loocv is a branch of cross validation techniques practical where the amount of available data is insufficient to create the training and testing subsets cawley and talbot 2003 caro gutiérrez et al 2019 loocv makes optimum use of all available data since each observation used both as training and validation consecutively this technique frequently mentioned regarding its ability in providing an almost unbiased estimation cawley and talbot 2003 as cases like this study where the number of observations is limited sor et al 2017 in such cases just a small perturbation of the training data substantially affects the fitted model cawley and talbot 2003 this highlights the capability of loocv strategy which minimizes the perturbation to the data in each trial the fitted models were assessed using four standard statistical criteria named mean error me mean absolute error mae root mean squared error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 that can be calculated as follows rossel and behrens 2010 taghizadeh mehrjardi et al 2014 shahabi et al 2017 1 me 1 n i 1 n z x oi z x pi 2 mae 1 n i 1 n z x oi z x pi 3 rmse 1 n i 1 n z x oi z x pi 2 4 r 2 i 1 n z x oi z x o z x pi z x p i 1 n z x oi z x o 2 i 1 n z x pi z x p 2 2 where n is the number of observed data z x o i and z x p i are observed and predicted target variables respectively to have a better comparison of prediction accuracy the relative rmse rmse exploited to compare models accuracy in predicting studied soil properties this dimensionless criterion allows comparing the accuracy of different variables with different ranges rmse is calculated as park and vlek 2002 5 rmse rmse z x o moreover the taylor diagram taylor 2001 and point density plot were employed as a further diagnostic tools to analyze the performance and accuracy of mars and gep models predictions a taylor diagram is a graphic depiction of the observed and estimated data which presents several characteristics of the predicted and observed values simultaneously it can illustrate and quantify the degree of correspondence between modeled and observed in terms of three statistical criteria correlation coefficient r standard deviation sd and rmse in a single diagram in the taylor diagram the closer model to the observation point in the diagram has the higher predictive performance khosravi et al 2018 2 6 uncertainty analysis in the modeling process model inputs observed data and covariate information model parameters and model structure are the three main potential sources of the model output uncertainty minasny and mcbratney 2002 malone et al 2017 arrouays et al 2014 accordingly the model output comprises all sources of uncertainty in this study the uncertainty treated based on the model output errors to assess the uncertainty of the predictions the 90 prediction interval pi derived from n number of fitted models n is the number of contributing data which is 69 during the loocv phase malone et al 2016 for mars and gep for each fitted model during iterations the prediction map prediction realization was generated and the variance of prediction realizations for each pixel was estimated then the prediction interval width piw was defined by estimating the 90 upper and lower prediction limits padarian et al 2017 the result is a map of 90 piw at each 30 m pixel which is used as criteria to evaluate the prediction uncertainty over the study area shahbazi et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 descriptive statistics descriptive statistics of soil moisture retention parameters are summarized in table 2 the mean oc sp and clay were 0 61 44 73 and 29 01 respectively oc ranged from 0 15 to 2 48 sp ranged from 20 7 to 59 09 and clay ranged from 4 8 to 64 4 the coefficient of variation cv results indicates that sp and oc had the lowest and highest variations respectively cv ranged from 20 21 to 55 73 for soil moisture retention properties variability of soil properties could be categorized based on wilding 1985 cv 16 low variability 16 cv 36 moderate variability and cv 36 high variability accordingly oc and clay showed high variability while sp had moderate variability skewness and kurtosis results indicated that oc and sp were not normally distributed except clay which had a nearly normal distribution but normality is not important for mars and gep due to their non parametric nature 3 2 model performance the models validated using loocv method based on me mae rmse and r2 the validation results are showed in table 3 and graphically presented in figs 3 and 4 based on me results mars had zero me error for oc sp and clay while gep prediction me for these properties were 0 01 0 24 and 0 50 respectively the negative value of me for sp using gep indicates gep model under estimate target sp values in other performance statistics such as mae and rmse the mars model had a low amount of errors in predicting all studied properties the scatter plots between observed and predicted values for soil oc sp and clay by mars and gep models are presented in fig 4 which shows r2 direction type and strength of the relations moreover for each prediction the upper and lower limits of the 95 prediction intervals are determined the comparison between predictions r2 values mars outperformed gep in the modeling of soil oc sp and clay with r2 of 0 85 0 72 and 0 67 respectively fig 4 indicates that the mars model provides a close linearly fitted line to the 1 1 line therefore mars predicted values are in better agreement with observed compared to gep for all studied soil properties regarding table 3 and fig 3 the highest and lowest performance was belonged to mars in predicting oc and gep in predicting clay respectively for better compression on the performance of mars and gep algorithms the curve fitting charts are presented in fig 5 in these charts the predicted values for soil properties from models were plotted and compared to those of the observed at the validation stage in oc prediction mars and gep could relatively predict fit high oc contents and both models predictions were slightly under performed in lower oc contents in sp prediction the models couldn t fit the highest and lowest sp values but mars provide closer prediction compared to those of gep in clay perditions gep could fit the highest clay content of 64 4 but none of the models were able to predict the lowest value of 4 8 except for the highest point mars predictions are close to observed values fig 5 demonstrates that mars generally fitted the curve better than gep in all studied soil properties additionally the distribution of observed and predicted values using mars and gep for soil oc sp and clay is presented as density plots in fig 6 density plots illustrate the difference in the distribution pattern of predicted and observed values in terms of range and density results revealed that in all soil properties prediction the mars density and distribution patterns were similar to those of observed data than gep gep model has predicted target values in certain domains and it leads to dense distribution patterns of points in some ranges compared to observed values and mars gep predicted targets had higher residuals compared to mars the results of the density plots are in accordance with the results of the regression and curve fitting to provide further discussion taylor diagrams employed to visually compare the capability of mars and gep models performance taylor considers sd r and rmse values between observed and predicted soil oc sp and clay for the mars and gep models taylor 2001 fig 7 expresses taylor diagrams for implemented models a superior model is identified by a reference point with r of 1 and the same sd compared to of observations consequently the closest point to the green point has superior performance and accuracy according to the taylor diagrams it is evident that the mars algorithm a red colored point presents superior predictions for soil oc sp and clay compared to gep taylor diagrams have supported the results of regression curve fitting and density plots and highly confirm that mars has a higher capability in simulating complex relationships between remote sensing derived covariates and soil moisture retention properties to predict them the results highlight that the mars algorithm outperformed gep in providing better and more accurate results 3 3 prediction accuracy the calculated rmse for mars and gep models are summarized and visually presented in fig 8 results revealed that the highest and lowest prediction accuracies were belonged to sp and clay using mars and gep models respectively in regards to comparing the accuracy of the implemented models the rmse values for mars were always lower than gep in other words mars provides results with the highest prediction accuracy for predicting soil moisture retention properties hengl et al 2004 describe rmse values close to 40 as fairly satisfactory prediction accuracy values higher than 71 as unacceptable unsatisfactory prediction regarding this classification both models were able to predict soil moisture retention properties with satisfactory accuracies however mars present superior predictions in all studied soil properties according to section 3 2 the highest and lowest performance was belonged to oc and clay predictions using mars and gep models the rmse results indicate that the highest and lowest prediction accuracies were belonged to mars in predicting sp and gep in predicting clay respectively as presented in fig 6 mars predicted sp values had a better coverage with observed values among other predictions the results exposed that the best performed model may not necessarily lead to the most accurate prediction as presented in tables 2 oc sp and clay are in different ranges and sp had the highest mean and lowest cv compared to oc and clay accordingly sp had the lowest variability and its predictions by both models provided the least relative rmse 3 4 variables of importance among all of the utilized environmental and remote sensing derived covariates band1 5 7 pc1 pc4 brightness wetness greenness ndvi ndsi savi sbr elevation slope and x and y coordinates were important covariates in predicting soil moisture retention properties the detail results of the importance of the variables in predicting oc sp and clay by mars and gep is presented in fig 9 for instance band1 2 and 5 for mars and y coordinate brightness and savi for gep were the most effective covariates in oc prediction according to fig 9 the x and y coordinates were important geographical covariates responsible for predicting soil moistures retention properties using applied techniques the importance of these covariates indicates spatial trends in studied soil properties the results showed the contribution of wetness in predicting oc and clay using both techniques generally moisture capacity is relatively high in soil with quite high clay content and this moisture can support plant growth and lead to higher oc 3 5 spatial prediction fig 10 shows prediction maps of soil moisture retention properties prediction maps of oc mars predicted higher values in center and southwest and the lower amounts in northern western and eastern parts of the area but gep predicted oc values in lower ranges and present oc content in light green over the area this caused regarding low prediction capability of gep as demonstrated in fig 6 the gep model predicted target oc values in certain domains around 0 5 and predicted values were not cover the observed domain figs 4 and 6 therefore the gep model produced a map in which the prediction values were around 0 5 as observable in fig 10 prediction maps of sp mars predict lower values in northwest and southeast parts and areas with higher sp are located in the northeast center and southwest of the area this is highly matched with the oc mars map which indicated that in areas with high oc high sp is observable gep predicted lower sp values in north west and southeastern parts gep predictions were in middle range values and couldn t predict the lowest and highest values of sp prediction maps of clay mars predict lower clay content in north northwest northeast south and southeastern parts these areas are boundaries of the plain that are closer to mountainous areas but in the east west southwest and central areas high clay contents are predicted which are located in the center of the plain and are far from the mountainous areas higher clay content in the central and lowest part of plains has two reasons 1 soil texture gets finer as altitude drops and 2 clay transportation from highland and its re depositionin plain caused by floods and runoffs during the time gep model predicted higher clay content in central parts as well but it predicts clay content in the middle range 15 40 of observed values according to all generated maps oc sp and clay have higher values in central and western parts of the plain with the lowest elevation which validated by the effect of elevation and terrain characteristics on the variability of moisture retention properties the mars algorithm was able to extract the spatial patterns of oc sp and clay better than gep overall mars performed better in illustrating the spatial distribution of all studied soil properties based on mars predicted maps the sp spatial pattern was similar to oc and clay these similarities between the spatial distribution of sp with oc and clay confirmed that sp presumably governed by oc and clay content 3 6 uncertainty quantifying the uncertainty of the prediction maps is essential and confirms their applicability for managerial decision making procedures the piw maps that were calculated using the estimated upper and lower prediction limits of soil moisture retention properties for mars and gep models are presented in fig 11 the generated uncertainty maps highlighted the problematic areas and facilitated the interpretation of the models accuracies the spatial pattern of the piw for the dsm reveals the differences in the magnitude of uncertainty attributed to each property and model generally gep predicted maps had a higher uncertainty and piw values in all parts compared to mars regarding its under estimation behavior the highest piw were observed generally in central and southern parts as presented in table 4 the mean prediction interval width mpiw values indicate that the accuracy and precision of mars predictions are higher than gep for oc sp and clay the gep provided wider piw for all studied soil properties compared to mars the highest and lowest mpiw are belonged to gep in predicting clay and mars in predicting oc respectively uncertainty of oc prediction mars has the highest and lowest uncertainty in the southwest and central parts of the area respectively gep has higher uncertainty in all parts compared to mars however the uncertainty is high in the north east southeast south southwest and west of the area uncertainty of sp prediction both of the prediction maps had the lowest uncertainty in northwest and southeast of the area the high uncertainty observed in the eastern central and western parts the highest piw in predicting sp has belonged to gep which observed in the center southwest and west of the study area uncertainty of clay prediction the highest and lowest piw values for mars were observed in the central and northern parts of the area respectively gep prediction has the highest uncertainty in the west center and east of the area both mars and gep had higher uncertainty in central parts compared to other parts 3 7 future works this research presents a pathway to start further studies on the application of data mining or other numerical modeling algorithms as predictive models in dsm 4 conclusion in the current study two data mining techniques named mars and gep are employed as predictive models in dsm these models were applied to investigate their feasibility in predicting soil moisture retention properties such as oc sp and clay moreover several remote sensing based covariates were used to predict target variables the models performance and accuracy were evaluated based on statistical and graphical approaches the spatial distribution maps of all studied soil properties were generated by mars and gep along with their associated uncertainty maps this study highlights the role of data mining numerical modeling algorithms as predictive models in dsm the results opened a new research line for accurate dsm the main findings of the study can be concluded as 1 the combined remote sensing data and powerful numerical models enable predicting spatial patterns of soil moistures retention properties 2 the x and y coordinates were important geographical covariates responsible for predicting soil moistures properties using applied techniques 3 the mars outperformed the gep algorithm based on five statistical metrics and four graphic approaches in all predictions 4 mars model has a higher predictive power and processing speed whereas gep has lower performance and require a higher run time 5 mars performed better in showing the patterns and spatial distribution of all studied soil properties 6 mars produced less prediction uncertainty and provided accurate prediction maps using fewer covariates than gep credit authorship
