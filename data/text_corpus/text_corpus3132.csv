15660,the occurrence of hydrogen sulfide h2s represents a challenge for recirculating aquaculture systems ras under saline conditions even low concentrations of the toxic gas can result in sudden mass mortalities of fish leading to large economic losses there is an urgent need for efficient strategies to remove h2s which can be applied effectively with a short response time to prevent the risk of h2s induced casualties this study examines the kinetics of the two common oxidants applied to rearing water in a ras facility oxygen o2 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and evaluates their efficiency and applicability for the removal of h2s in an industrial ras furthermore we tested whether nitrate no3 can be an oxygen donor in the chemical oxidation of h2s the baseline oxidation rates of h2s by o2 were determined in air equilibrated seawater sw and ras water rasw the feasibility of using h2o2 as a practical treatment was evaluated by testing increasing h2o2 to h2s ratios in sw in addition rasw dilutions that yielded different concentrations of no3 and total chemical oxygen demand tcod were tested to identify their effects on h2s removal the half lives t½ of h2s derived from o2 oxidation rates were considerably shorter in sw 118 5 28 6 min compared to rasw 168 0 18 7 min the addition of a 1 1 mole ratio of h2o2 to h2s significantly increased the removal rate and decreased the half life t½ of h2s in sw to 29 5 6 6 min further increasing h2o2 h2s ratios to 2 1 and 4 1 reduced t½ to 21 7 5 2 and 17 4 6 1 min respectively similarly a dosage of h2o2 at a ratio of 1 1 in ras water resulted in a considerably shorter t½ of 86 1 10 1 min the influence of organic matter on the required h2o2 dose was demonstrated by the t½ which were reduced by 49 in ras water and 75 in sw no3 was not found to be involved in the chemical removal of h2s the results provide an improved understanding of the influence of ras water chemistry and quality on h2s kinetics and the direct applicability of the kinetics for treating acute h2s levels in ras to avoid mass mortalities in conclusion the addition of h2o2 is an efficient water treatment technology for h2s removal and by adjusting h2o2 dosages accordingly to the concentrations of h2s and specific systems water parameters a t½ 30 min can be achieved thus the technology is applicable in an industrial ras as a treatment process for acute levels of the hazardous gas h2s that is easily implemented and safe for the fish graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hydrogen sulfide removal oxidants recirculating aquaculture system water quality hydrogen peroxide nitrate data for reference data will be made available on request 1 introduction recirculating aquaculture systems ras allow for intensive production of fish with a reduced water use 0 1 1 m3 kg feed martins et al 2010 however intensive production and increasing water reuse are not without challenges and in recent years hydrogen sulfide h2s has been recognized as a problem in ras due to the potential of h2s formation when operating under saline conditions h2s is a highly toxic gas and has been reported to cause mass mortalities in salmonids with adverse economic consequences for aquaculture producers sommerset et al 2020 although h2s is a more recent concern for the aquaculture industry it has been a long standing problem in other industries for example h2s production in wastewater treatment facilities and various industrial processes has been a challenge for decades partly due to its corrosive properties and partly due to its high toxicity and odor nuisance giuffrè and vicente 2018 zhang et al 2008 however due to the difference in the water chemistry and conditions of aquaculture systems compared to wastewater facilities and the subsequent effect on the reactivity of h2s neither the reported removal kinetics of h2s nor the practical approaches are directly applicable in an industrial ras the main production of h2s is carried out by sulfate reducing bacteria srb the srb can utilize sulfate so4 2 as a terminal electron acceptor when nitrate no3 is not available and this process produces h2s as a metabolic by product the h2s producing bacteria are found in the biofilm or sediments in the suboxic anoxic zone where they exploit the simple carbon sources from the microbes in the upper layer where aerobic respiration is possible muyzer and stams 2008 dissolved inorganic and organic matter as well as the particulate material fuels the microbial communities rurangwa and verdegem 2015 and the microbial decomposition of organic material under anaerobic conditions leads to the production of h2s seawater contains much higher concentrations of so4 2 than freshwater and the availability of so4 2 in saltwater aquaculture facilities combined with feed waste feces and residues from bacterial decay contribute to a pool of organic matter present in ras that is available for degradation by the srb during anoxic conditions hence the production potential of h2s increases with salinity and experiments in anaerobic batch reactors showed a maximum concentration of produced h2s of up to 153 9 34 1 mg l in 35 letelier gordo et al 2020 all together the conditions in a saltwater aquaculture system create a potential risk for the buildup of h2s especially in systems that rely on increased reuse of water e g ras than flow through to maintain good water quality in reused water ras relies on a variety of water treatment processes such as solids filtration oxygenation and degassing in addition biofiltration is used in the conversion of ammonia nitrogen into no3 the latter of which is harmless to the fish rurangwa and verdegem 2015 the concentration of no3 that builds up due to this conversion process depends on the intensity of the system but is generally around 70 150 mg l no3 n van rijn 2013 unfortunately the biofilters that maintain essential functions of the system can create conditions that are favorable for the h2s producing srb rojas tirado et al 2021 the production rate of h2s is dependent on the activities of the srb which is regulated by the complex interactions between the available organic matter the species composition of the microbial community and oxygen availability rojas tirado et al 2021 the h2s production potential in the anaerobic zones of the biofilters is high 29 g h2s kg tcod in 17 and will typically result in a burst or pulse of h2s rojas tirado et al 2021 although o2 is continuously supplied to the system to maintain o2 saturation levels to satisfy fish demands anoxic areas may occur in zones with low water flow and accumulation of solid waste which can also create a basis for continuous h2s release and result in chronic exposure to h2s rojas tirado et al 2021 the hydraulic retention time in a typical ras is 30 40 min a b holan pers comm which means that some time is likely to pass before h2s produced in a specific area reaches the rearing tank this provides a relevant time frame for an applied treatment and its required efficacy the reported toxic concentrations of h2s differ between fish species and range from 0 034 to 1 4 mg l in marine fish species with varying tolerance levels depending on life stages temperature and oxygen saturation adelman and smith jr 1972 bagarinao and vetter 1989 smith et al 1976 the toxic effect in fish is exerted by diffusion of h2s from the ambient water over the gills where h2s easily penetrates cellular membranes hughes et al 2009 reiffenstein 1992 at the cellular level h2s impairs respiration by inhibiting the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase preventing the production of atp cooper and brown 2008 1 1 chemistry of h2s in an aqueous solution in an aqueous solution h2s exists in equilibrium between gaseous and aqueous phases h2s is one of three sulfide species present in water the others being the hydrosulfide ion hs and sulfide s2 the sulfide species exists in two equilibriums the fraction of each species present is a function of ph as follows 1 h 2 s h s h 2 h s s 2 h in addition to ph the h2s hs equilibrium is affected by the temperature and ionic strength of the water and the dissociation of h2s can be calculated when those values are known millero et al 1988 in saltwater the dissociation curve is slightly different than in freshwater as the pka1 decreases with salinity in seawater 15 c 35 the pka1 is around 6 6 which means that at ph below 6 6 h2s is the dominant species and above ph 6 6 hs predominates fig 1 millero et al 1988 s2 does not occur at ph values 10 making it irrelevant for aquaculture facilities which are typically maintained at ph ranges between 6 0 8 0 depending on salinity and the cultured species and life stage poxton and allouse 1982 removal of h2s can be achieved by oxidation using various chemical agents or by biological processes the latter includes altering conditions that favor oxidation of reduced sulfide compounds zhang et al 2008 since hs is the main reactive sulfide species the oxidation rate differs according to the ph as a function of the change in sulfide speciation hoffmann 1977 as a result of the high reactivity and prevalence of hs in higher ph ranges the oxidation rate is independent of ph greater than 8 zhang and millero 1993 the presence of h2s as both a gas and in an aqueous form provides the possibility to target the gaseous phase e g through degassing to remove h2s or the more reactive aqueous speciation hs by oxidation at ph 7 4 the majority of the h2s is present in its ionized form hs and by using the approach of oxidation for removal it is possible to target a larger pool of the problematic compound in production facilities the technology for the addition of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and oxygen o2 is commonly present on site where it is used to improve water quality and maintain fish welfare as such the approach is not technically demanding the respective compounds are already commonly used or present in aquaculture facilities for disinfection and oxygenation burridge et al 2010 oxidation of h2s in an aqueous solution leads to the production of sulfite so3 2 thiosulfate s2o3 2 and sulfate so4 2 with the distribution of the products varying according to the conditions of the solution the prevalence of the formed products from the oxidation of sulfide differs as a consequence of salinity ph and the concentrations of reactants with the two latter exerting the largest effect on product formation zhang and millero 1993 the initial product is so3 2 but it is generally found in small quantities because sulfite is rapidly oxidized to sulfate and the overall reaction can be reduced to morse et al 1987 3 h s 2 o 2 so 4 2 h the rate at which h2s is removed by o2 depends on the speciation of sulfide temperature the concentration of o2 and the presence of catalysts millero et al 1987 zhang and millero 1993 such as trace metals e g fe2 mn2 cu2 pb2 which exert a large effect on the oxidation rate due to their catalyzing effect vazquez et al 1989 oxidation rates can be further increased by adding compounds with greater oxidizing potential hydrogen peroxide h2o2 is a strong oxidizing agent and has been used in sewage systems to eliminate h2s and as a disinfectant hoffmann 1977 zhang et al 2008 the compound is generally considered environmentally safe as h2o2 decomposes into water and oxygen leaving no toxic residues h2o2 is also already widely used in the management of aquaculture systems to eliminate pathogens and improve water quality through disinfection bögner et al 2021 burridge et al 2010 the stoichiometry and kinetics of the oxidation of h2s by h2o2 have been examined in the context of wastewater treatment where the complete oxidation of h2s is achieved when h2o2 is added to h2s at a mole ratio of 1 1 4 1 cadena and peters 1988 the difference in the stoichiometry for h2o2 needed to completely oxidize h2s varies depending on the ph of the solution the rate limiting step is the reaction of h2o2 with hs which is consequently dependent on ph conditions as the speciation of sulfide is determined by the established equilibrium eq 1 millero et al 1989 accordingly the products formed from the oxidation of h2s by h2o2 including elemental sulfur sulfate and the intermediate polysulfides differ as a consequence of ph as shown in eq 4 and 5 hoffmann 1977 millero et al 1989 4 h s h 2 o 2 h 2 h 2 o s 5 h s 4 h 2 o 2 so 4 2 4 h 2 o h consequently oxidation of h2s by h2o2 either produces or consumes hydrogen ions depending on the ph hoffmann 1977 in the aquaculture industry it has been suggested that no3 reacts with h2s and converts h2s to so4 2 højgaard 2017 and that a source of no3 can be added to aqueous systems to remove h2s langeteig 2019 under conditions when no3 levels are low e g due to withholding of feed before the harvest due to the continuous development of environmentally sustainable ras which includes reducing the waste discharge from production no3 levels in ras already receive attention due to the management and elimination of nitrogenous waste which are generally high in ras van rijn et al 2006 thus adding more no3 to reduce h2s because of the assumption that no3 chemically oxidizes h2s is counterproductive the present study set out to evaluate the efficiency and applicability of o2 and h2o2 as a treatment for the removal of h2s in both seawater and industrial ras water as a secondary objective we tested whether no3 plays a role in the chemical oxidation of h2s or if the applicability of no3 is restricted to a reduction of h2s through biological oxidation to assess the potential of applying the tested oxygen donors o2 h2o2 and no3 for h2s removal the experiments were divided into three parts consisting of 1 comparison of h2s oxidation kinetics by o2 in the different water sources ultrapure water seawater and water from an industrial ras 2 the effect of h2o2 dosage in three ratios of h2o2 to h2s and the applied kinetics and 3 the effect of organic material and no3 on the removal rate of h2s 2 materials and methods 2 1 water three different water solutions were used for the experiments ultrapure water upw seawater sw with a salinity of 33 and ras water rasw of 35 table 1 ras water samples were collected from the outlet of the rearing

measurements were performed with a sulf 500 microsensor unisense denmark and measurements were recorded with the compatible software sensortrace logger the sulf 500 microsensors measure the partial pressure of h2s gas in real time the sensors were calibrated in the same water used in the experiment upw sw rasw and adjusted to ph 2 calibration was performed using a 6 point calibration ranging from 0 to 2 mg l r 2 0 98 before each new trial in the corresponding water type sulfide stock solutions with a concentration of 0 1 m total dissolved sulfide tds were prepared by dissolving na2s 9h2o sigma aldrich st louis mo usa in anoxic upw bubbled with nitrogen gas 2 3 experimental design 2 3 1 baseline oxidation rates in the first experiment 500 ml of air saturated water upw sw or ras was added to open glass beakers the experiments were carried out in a temperature regulated room at 13 3 0 2 c resembling the temperature in a salmon producing ras facility open beakers were used to allow for water air interactions and volatilization of h2s to imitate the condition in a ras upw served as a control for h2s oxidation rates beakers were gently stirred at 100 rpm using a magnetic stirrer ika germany and ph was adjusted to ph 7 4 0 1 by the addition of 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh sulfide stock solution was added to the beakers with a pipette in volumes yielding concentrations of either 1 2 or 4 mg l tds and values of h2s concentration were recorded every 60 s the experimental concentrations were chosen as they represent intermediate concentrations of the potentially produced h2s in the system and where fish mortalities occur upw was buffered with 0 02 m potassium phosphate buffer while sw and ras water were buffered with 0 02 m borax buffer to control ph during experiments ph levels and oxygen concentrations were measured and logged using an optical multi analyte meter and dedicated logging software pyroscience gmbh aachen germany 2 3 2 oxidation by h2o2 to evaluate the effect of h2o2 on the removal rate of h2s and if different dosages of h2o2 influence oxidation rate h2o2 was added at mole ratios of 1 1 2 1 or 4 1 h2o2 h2s following the addition of 1 2 and 4 mg l tds h2s concentrations were allowed to peak before adding h2o2 h2s peaks were identified by observing the sensor reading point where h2s concentrations stopped increasing at which point a 0 1 m h2o2 solution was added to achieve the desired h2o2 h2s mole ratio 2 3 3 nitrate and tcod in the third experiment 3 dilutions of industrial ras water were tested undiluted ras water 100 70 ras water and 45 ras water for dilutions ras water was mixed with seawater a water sample was taken before adding h2s and h2o2 ratio of 1 1 and after 6 h when the experiments were terminated samples for anions cations and total chemical oxygen demand tcod were collected and stored at 4 c before analysis 15 ml of water was filtered through 0 2 µm syringe filters filtropur s sarstedt germany and analyzed for

determination of tcod was performed using a test kit lck 1814 hach lange germany 2 4 data processing and calculations the fraction of h2s that is present in an aqueous solution as a function of temperature ph and ionic strength of the water was calculated by the equation 6 h 2 s tds 1 k h where tds is the concentration of total dissolved sulfide h 10 ph and k represents the effect of temperature and salinity and can be obtained from the equation derived from millero et al 1988 7 k 98 08 5765 4 t 15 0455 ln t 0 157 s 0 5 0 0135 s where t is the temperature kelvin and s is salinity at the experimental conditions of this study h2s will account for approximately 18 37 of tds depending on ph temperature and the ionic strength of the water with the highest fraction present in upw and decreasing h2s concentrations as salinity increases the general equation that characterizes the oxidation rate of h2s by o2 is a second order reaction morse et al 1987 however when o2 concentrations are in excess compared to h2s the oxidation rate can be described as a first order reaction zhang and millero 1993 8 d h 2 s dt k 1 h 2 s where t is time min 1 the rate k1 at which h2s is removed was calculated by log transforming data a regression line was fitted and the k value was obtained from the slope of the regression the half life t½ of h2s was thereafter calculated as 9 t 1 2 ln 2 k 1 where h2o2 was added the rate constant was calculated as zero order k0 and first order k1 because the rate of removal changed over time the initial data points followed a linear trend and were fitted with a zero order equation not substrate limited and linear regression r2 0 96 was performed to determine k0 half life was calculated as 10 t 1 2 a 0 2 k 0 where a0 is the initial concentration of h2s from the remaining values described by a first order reaction the rate constant was deducted according to the description above 2 5 statistical analysis all statistical analyses and graphs were performed using sigmaplot v 14 0 systat software inc the data were tested for differences between treatments aqueous solutions mole ratio of h2o2 h2s and dilutions of ras water and concentrations of h2s with a two way analysis of variance anova and followed by pairwise multiple comparison procedures holm sidak data were tested for normal distribution normality test shapiro wilk and homogeneity of variance equal variance test brown forsythe prior to anova differences were considered statistically significant when p 0 05 values are presented as mean s d 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of water characteristics on h2s as a result of the different chemical characteristics table 1 of the three solutions used the fraction of h2s present was affected similar to other gases the solubility of h2s is determined by the ionic strength of the solution which differs between the three experimental solutions the solubility of h2s decreases when salinity increases and the reduction in solubility is greater compared to o2 and co2 morse et al 1987 the influence of salinity on solubility can be seen from the initial concentrations in fig 2 each of the three treatments received a similar initial dose of 1 2 or 4 mg l tds as a result of the ionic strength of the water and the speciation of sulfide more h2s is present in upw compared to sw and rasw the calculated fraction eqs 6 and 7 of tds present as h2s at ph 7 4 and 14 c in upw sw and rasw was 36 20 and 20 respectively variations in temperature during the experiments were no more than 1 c table 3 and thus inconsequential for the speciation of h2s 3 2 oxidation of h2s by o2 in different aqueous systems the oxidation curves of h2s in the three experimental solutions are shown in fig 2 for each water type and the three initial concentrations of sulfide added 1 2 and 4 mg l tds the oxidation rates of h2s in fig 2 are best described by a first order reaction and the oxidation rates k1 obtained from the regression line r 2 0 95 were independent of h2s concentration within each treatment table 3 while oxidation kinetics of h2s were not influenced by the initial concentration of added sulfide there was a difference in removal rates between the treatments rates and t½ calculated eqs 8 and 9 from k1 differed significantly p 0 001 between the three water treatments where a considerably faster removal of h2s was observed in sw followed by rasw and upw table 3 the difference in removal rates and t½ due to the variability of the chemical composition of the three types of water illustrates the complex reactivity of h2s as a result of changes in the chemistry of the water the faster oxidation rates observed in sw compared to rasw were ascribed to the higher content of organic material in the rasw treatments compared to sw as reflected by their higher tcod the presence of organic matter and microbes that can interact with o2 compete with h2s and thus reduces the availability of o2 to oxidize h2s to exclude that the difference in oxidation rate between sw and rasw was caused by high concentrations of iron compounds fe2 and fe3 were measured trace metals influence the reaction rate through a catalytic effect on the rate of oxidation of h2s the effective concentration level of fe3 is 750 nm and is followed by visual precipitation of sulfides only fe2 exerts an effect at low concentrations 100 nm vazquez et al 1989 mean concentrations in rasw were 11 3 nm 0 63 µg l fe2 and 109 2 nm 6 1 µg fe3 l and the effect exerted by the low concentrations are modest the same applies in sw where concentrations were lower than required for precise determination the upw treatment had the slowest oxidation rate and served as a baseline for the oxidation kinetics as no trace metals are present and can influence the oxidation rate of h2s previous studies on sulfide chemistry and oxidation kinetics vary considerably in methodology and experimental design open vs closed beakers and conditions e g ph temperature oxygen content chelating agents and use of buffers direct comparisons between results can prove difficult as changing one variable can affect the kinetics of h2s this discrepancy due to the variation in experimental parameters is exemplified by millero et al 1987 where the reported t½ span from 2 h to more than 26 h our experiments were performed in open beakers which allowed for the volatilization of h2s g to imitate the conditions in an aquaculture facility the air water transfer rate is largely influenced by turbulence and ph and increases with turbulence and decreasing ph yongsiri et al 2004 both parameters were kept constant in the present study with low turbulence and a ph of 7 4 and any effect between treatments would be insignificant contrary differences in removal rates and t½ between experiments conducted in sealed beakers versus open beakers are expected and can explain some of the variability of the reported half lives by millero et al 1987 due to passive loss of h2s deleon et al 2012 3 3 effect of hydrogen peroxide on the oxidation kinetics of h2s the effect of adding h2o2 as an oxidizing agent to facilitate the removal of h2s from sw is demonstrated in fig 3 depending on the mole ratio the removal of h2s was accelerated in the first 10 30 min thereeafter the rate slowed down due to the fast initial removal of h2s the first part of the reaction was described by a zero order reaction maximum removal rate and the remaining part follows a first order reaction the difference between the kinetics observed in the first part of the reaction k 0 and the latter k 1 can be ascribed to the decomposition of h2o2 pedersen and pedersen 2012 additional to the reaction between h2o2 and h2s h2o2 oxidizes the organic material in the water thus decreasing the concentration of h2o2 over time as a consequence the h2s removal rate decreases as h2o2 is consumed which is reflected in the shift between rate constants and the kinetics that apply all three mole ratios of h2o2 h2s resulted in increased removal rates both in the maximum removal rate k 0 and the rate constant k 1 in the low h2o2 treatment ratio 1 1 k 0 was significantly lower p 0 001 than the ratios of 2 1 and 4 1 fig 4 a no effect on removal rate was observed between the latter showing that increasing the mole ratio above 2 1 did not further accelerate the maximum removal rate which indicates that when h2o2 is available in excess of h2s maximum removal rates are independent of the ratios of h2o2 h2s as a result when more organic material is present a higher h2o2 h2s ratio needs to be applied to compensate for the fraction of h2o2 that is consumed by the organic material the highest maximum removal rate of h2s measured was 0 052 mg min 1 with a t½ 8 2 min and was observed in the treatment with the highest added h2o2 dose mole ratio 4 1 tds 4 mg l the t½ calculated from rate constants k 0 eq 10 and k 1 eq 9 are summarized in table 4 regardless of a reduced effect of h2o2 after 10 20 min a difference between treatments persisted over time with an increase in the rate constants k 1 proportional to the increase in h2o2 h2s mole ratios fig 4 b the mean values for k 1 in ratios of 1 1 2 1 and 4 1 h2o2 to h2s were 0 025 0 034 and 0 045 min 1 respectively the effect of h2o2 on the removal rate was already significant p 0 001 at a mole ratio of 1 1 fig 4 b this suggests that h2o2 is present at concentrations necessary to maintain increased oxidation rates as the majority of the h2o2 reacting with the organic material is consumed during the initial part of the reaction shorter t½ of 16 20 min was found in the 4 1 treatment which was approximately half of the t½ found in 1 1 table 4 contrary to the dissimilarity between values of t½ for oxidation of h2s by o2 reported in the work by millero et al 1977 in seawater t½ 14 30 min for h2s in seawater spiked with h2o2 are similar to the t½ in this study table 4 this range makes the treatment feasible in saltwater ras where the hydraulic retention time hrt typically is 30 40 min the precise location in the ras loop where a h2s problem arises will influence the kinetics applied with respect to the required rate of removal and the h2o2 dose fig 5 zero order kinetics should be applied in the event of a h2s burst and where rapid removal is required a burst of h2s usually occurs in the biofilters where the production potential is high whereas the lower non acute concentrations are more likely to occur in the rearing tank at lower concentrations and during a steady increase or a chronic production of h2s in the rearing tank values of k1 are applicable as maximum removal rates are not required at low h2s concentrations this approach prevents a buildup of h2s leading to toxic concentrations and gives the production facility time to apply an emergency protocol such as withholding feeding and exchange of water in the system implementing the method requires a high sensitivity on line sensor to monitor h2s concentrations and a pump to dose h2o2 at the necessary volume and frequency the positioning of 3 sensors fig 5 that are connected to a feedback loop allows for a fast dose response to increasing h2s concentrations dosage of h2o2 is initiated when h2s exceeds the predefined safe levels of h2s 0 02 mg l and a dose response according to the k1 kinetics is initiated removal of 0 02 mg l of h2s by addition of h2o2 in a mole ratio of 4 1 requires a h2o2 concentration of 0 08 mg l assuming a removal rate k1 of 0 045 fig 4 b the remaining h2s is reduced to 0 0052 mg l after 30 min at concentrations 0 02 mg l k0 kinetics apply and administration of h2o2 in a mole ratio of 4 1 requires 0 12 mg l of h2o2 to remove 0 04 mg l of h2s assuming a rate constant k0 of 0 0013 mg l 1 min 1 derived from a linear regression performed on the values presented in fig 4 a h2s is reduced to 0 02 mg l after 15 8 min if applied to a system with a volume of 758 m3 and a flow of 1150 m3 h with a loss rate ke v q for h2o2 of 0 025 min 1 the addition of 1 l stock solution of 170 1 g l h2o2 will result in a h2o2 concentration of 0 22 mg l h2o2 dosage v e ke t after 10 min the h2o2 concentration is at 0 17 mg l and supplementary dosage is required to further reduce h2s to 0 02 mg l with a t½ of 15 8 min t½ 0 04 mg l 2 0 0013 mg l 1 min 1 for rapid removal of h2s h2o2 dosages can be repeated every 10 min for a total of 34 min where after h2s concentration is below 0 01 mg l assuming a repeated dosage of 1 l stock solution 170 1 g l h2o2 at times 0 10 20 and 30 min a total of 680 g h2o2 is needed using a h2o2 solution of 35 11 8 m 424 ml is used to produce 170 05 g l 5 m 1 l in total 1 7 l is needed at a cost of 58 22 kg containing 35 h2o2 novadan against a loss of 228 5 thousand if biomass is lost with a stocking density of 50 kg m3 and a market price of 6 per kg at rapidly increasing h2s concentrations maximum removal rates k0 must be maintained but the safe levels of h2o2 that can be applied differ between locations low doses of h2o2 up to 15 mg l do not have a negative impact on fish and biofilter performance and can be added without reducing system performance bögner et al 2021 in practice this means that if a 4 1 mole ratio of h2o2 h2s is applied 15 mg l of h2o2 will allow for the removal of 3 75 mg l of h2s in water with low tcod at higher tcod concentrations the removal potential of h2o2 is reduced as h2o2 is also consumed by the organic material due to the risk of adding h2o2 in concentrations higher than 15 mg l in the biofilter and because of the enzymatic degradation of h2o2 it is recommended to add h2o2 after the biofilter fig 5 this allows for higher dosages of h2o2 and reduces the potential of a bacteria mediated reduction of h2o2 in contrast a higher h2o2 concentration can be allowed in the rearing tank as salmonids are rather tolerant to short term exposure to h2o2 and 100 mg l is considered safe rach et al 1997 wood et al 2021 the above is provided as a generalization of the application of the treatment in practice but as all systems differ specific modifications in the dosage of h2o2 relative to system tcod and bacterial activity are necessary the increased rates due to accelerated oxidation of h2s are also apparent when observing oxygen saturation over time the oxidation of h2s results in a decrease in available oxygen fig 6 proportional to the removal rates and a steeper curve is observed as removal rates of h2s increase dosage of h2o2 in the absence of h2s results in an oxygen peak as the water becomes oversaturated however when h2s is present the peak in oxygen concentration is abolished as liberated oxygen rapidly reacts with h2s at the highest oxidation rate fig 6 c this leads to a reduction in dissolved o2 mg l by as much as 34 the oxidation of h2s is a continuous consumer of o2 which is a concern in relation to the removal of h2s as well as for the health and welfare of the fish in the production facilities 3 4 effect of tcod and nitrate in ras water fig 7 illustrates the zero and first order kinetics that describes the course of the reaction supplemented by the ln transformed data used to obtain the rate constant k1 removal rates of h2s were not affected by the rasw dilutions p 0 138 and the accompanying differences in water chemistry fig 8 similar to the previous experiments the addition of h2o2 increased the initial rate of removal and the first part of the oxidation curve was best described by zero order kinetics and the latter by first order the rate constant k 0 and the half lives derived from the values are listed in table 5 the rate independence of the different rasw dilutions indicates that organic material was still present in amounts that were high enough to retard the reaction between h2s and h2o2 as the oxidation rate was slower than that measured in sw therefore the efficiency of h2o2 seems to be reduced in the presence of organic matter or other compounds that can compete with h2s in the reaction with h2o2 that could be the case in waters with high bacterial activity where enzymes utilized by bacteria to decompose h2o2 such as catalase could influence rates due to enzymatic degradation of h2o2 pedersen et al 2019 demonstrated the effect of bacteria mediated h2o2 degeneration on the decomposition rate of h2o2 they reported a t½ for h2o2 in ras water of 29 4 min which compared to a t½ of 2 27 h in 0 2 µl filtered ras water shows a strong correlation between microbial activity and degeneration of the compound though neither maximum removal rate k 0 nor k 1 was influenced by dilution of the ras water the amount of h2o2 added had an effect on the removal of h2s half lives were found to be shorter p 0 001 for concentrations of 4 mg l tds fig 8 in the 45 and 70 treatments this could be explained by the higher volumes of h2o2 present that despite a fraction consumed by the organic material exist in quantities large enough to efficiently react with h2s the consequence of organic material on dosed h2o2 is evident when comparing the experiments conducted in sw and rasw fig 9 h2s was eliminated faster in sw compared to rasw by the addition of h2o2 where half lives on average were reduced by 75 and 49 respectively additionally the proportional reduction in t½ in untreated and h2o2 treated water was also significantly larger in sw compared to rasw fig 9 accordingly it seems reasonable to conclude that at increasing concentrations of organic matter measured as tcod a higher dosage of h2o2 is required for the removal of h2s due to the reaction with suspended organic particles the limitation of the practical use of h2o2 is predominantly due to the fast decomposition rate which renders it applicable for acute h2s treatment but the compound has no prolonged preventive effect chang et al 2007 nitrate has gained some attention as a method for controlling h2s within the aquaculture industry as it was hypothesized that h2s would react with no3 højgaard 2017 an effect that was supported by a lab scale study langeteig 2019 however the present study found no indication of such a chemical process as the initial no3 concentration did not decrease after the addition of sulfide table 6 in accordance with other studies mohanakrishnan et al 2009 yang et al 2005 our results indicate that no3 is not an oxygen donor that contributes to the oxidation of sulfide nonetheless no3 has the potential for controlling sulfide production and removal by biological oxidation both of which occur through activities of the microbial community but the process and effect is exerted over several hours to days torun et al 2020 wu et al 2016 which makes this approach ineffective as a treatment for managing an acute increase in h2s concentrations hence any benefit of maintaining a high no3 concentration is only relevant in the context of influencing the microbial community in oxygen depleted areas to favor the use of no3 instead of sulfate by srb and is not applicable as an acute treatment for removal of h2s 3 5 limitations and further research the study is limited by knowledge gaps of the response of atlantic salmon to increasing h2s concentrations and an examination of both behavioral and metabolic induced responses to identify the upper tolerance threshold to h2s is needed furthermore an assessment of the combined effect of h2s and h2o2 on the physiology of fish and the oxidation kinetics of h2s by h2o2 applied in a large scale experiment should also be accounted for before implementing h2o2 as a treatment in industrial ras 4 conclusion the obtained results demonstrate that h2o2 is an effective treatment for the removal of h2s and is suitable for application in seawater as the time required to achieve the desired effect on h2s is less than 30 min the efficacy of o2 within the normoxic range as a treatment for rapid removal of acute h2s is inadequate with half lives 100 min that exceed the general hydraulic retention time the effect of adding h2o2 is significant already at a mole ratio of 1 1 where t½ for h2s was reduced by 75 in sw and by 49 in rasw higher ratios of h2o2 h2s were shown to reduce half lives further although the achieved improvement is less substantial at higher ratios the applied dosage of h2o2 must be adjusted relative to the bacterial activity and organic load as liberated oxygen is consumed in the reaction with organic matter in the water higher ratios of h2o2 to h2s can be applied to compensate removal rates of h2s were not affected by no3 concentrations thus the addition of no3 in ras to increase the removal of h2s is not advised conclusively the proposed technology of h2o2 is a potentially effective method for fast removal of h2s and requires little technical equipment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgement thanks to ulla sproegel and brian møller for assistance in the lab and water analysis this study was

15660,the occurrence of hydrogen sulfide h2s represents a challenge for recirculating aquaculture systems ras under saline conditions even low concentrations of the toxic gas can result in sudden mass mortalities of fish leading to large economic losses there is an urgent need for efficient strategies to remove h2s which can be applied effectively with a short response time to prevent the risk of h2s induced casualties this study examines the kinetics of the two common oxidants applied to rearing water in a ras facility oxygen o2 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and evaluates their efficiency and applicability for the removal of h2s in an industrial ras furthermore we tested whether nitrate no3 can be an oxygen donor in the chemical oxidation of h2s the baseline oxidation rates of h2s by o2 were determined in air equilibrated seawater sw and ras water rasw the feasibility of using h2o2 as a practical treatment was evaluated by testing increasing h2o2 to h2s ratios in sw in addition rasw dilutions that yielded different concentrations of no3 and total chemical oxygen demand tcod were tested to identify their effects on h2s removal the half lives t½ of h2s derived from o2 oxidation rates were considerably shorter in sw 118 5 28 6 min compared to rasw 168 0 18 7 min the addition of a 1 1 mole ratio of h2o2 to h2s significantly increased the removal rate and decreased the half life t½ of h2s in sw to 29 5 6 6 min further increasing h2o2 h2s ratios to 2 1 and 4 1 reduced t½ to 21 7 5 2 and 17 4 6 1 min respectively similarly a dosage of h2o2 at a ratio of 1 1 in ras water resulted in a considerably shorter t½ of 86 1 10 1 min the influence of organic matter on the required h2o2 dose was demonstrated by the t½ which were reduced by 49 in ras water and 75 in sw no3 was not found to be involved in the chemical removal of h2s the results provide an improved understanding of the influence of ras water chemistry and quality on h2s kinetics and the direct applicability of the kinetics for treating acute h2s levels in ras to avoid mass mortalities in conclusion the addition of h2o2 is an efficient water treatment technology for h2s removal and by adjusting h2o2 dosages accordingly to the concentrations of h2s and specific systems water parameters a t½ 30 min can be achieved thus the technology is applicable in an industrial ras as a treatment process for acute levels of the hazardous gas h2s that is easily implemented and safe for the fish graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hydrogen sulfide removal oxidants recirculating aquaculture system water quality hydrogen peroxide nitrate data for reference data will be made available on request 1 introduction recirculating aquaculture systems ras allow for intensive production of fish with a reduced water use 0 1 1 m3 kg feed martins et al 2010 however intensive production and increasing water reuse are not without challenges and in recent years hydrogen sulfide h2s has been recognized as a problem in ras due to the potential of h2s formation when operating under saline conditions h2s is a highly toxic gas and has been reported to cause mass mortalities in salmonids with adverse economic consequences for aquaculture producers sommerset et al 2020 although h2s is a more recent concern for the aquaculture industry it has been a long standing problem in other industries for example h2s production in wastewater treatment facilities and various industrial processes has been a challenge for decades partly due to its corrosive properties and partly due to its high toxicity and odor nuisance giuffrè and vicente 2018 zhang et al 2008 however due to the difference in the water chemistry and conditions of aquaculture systems compared to wastewater facilities and the subsequent effect on the reactivity of h2s neither the reported removal kinetics of h2s nor the practical approaches are directly applicable in an industrial ras the main production of h2s is carried out by sulfate reducing bacteria srb the srb can utilize sulfate so4 2 as a terminal electron acceptor when nitrate no3 is not available and this process produces h2s as a metabolic by product the h2s producing bacteria are found in the biofilm or sediments in the suboxic anoxic zone where they exploit the simple carbon sources from the microbes in the upper layer where aerobic respiration is possible muyzer and stams 2008 dissolved inorganic and organic matter as well as the particulate material fuels the microbial communities rurangwa and verdegem 2015 and the microbial decomposition of organic material under anaerobic conditions leads to the production of h2s seawater contains much higher concentrations of so4 2 than freshwater and the availability of so4 2 in saltwater aquaculture facilities combined with feed waste feces and residues from bacterial decay contribute to a pool of organic matter present in ras that is available for degradation by the srb during anoxic conditions hence the production potential of h2s increases with salinity and experiments in anaerobic batch reactors showed a maximum concentration of produced h2s of up to 153 9 34 1 mg l in 35 letelier gordo et al 2020 all together the conditions in a saltwater aquaculture system create a potential risk for the buildup of h2s especially in systems that rely on increased reuse of water e g ras than flow through to maintain good water quality in reused water ras relies on a variety of water treatment processes such as solids filtration oxygenation and degassing in addition biofiltration is used in the conversion of ammonia nitrogen into no3 the latter of which is harmless to the fish rurangwa and verdegem 2015 the concentration of no3 that builds up due to this conversion process depends on the intensity of the system but is generally around 70 150 mg l no3 n van rijn 2013 unfortunately the biofilters that maintain essential functions of the system can create conditions that are favorable for the h2s producing srb rojas tirado et al 2021 the production rate of h2s is dependent on the activities of the srb which is regulated by the complex interactions between the available organic matter the species composition of the microbial community and oxygen availability rojas tirado et al 2021 the h2s production potential in the anaerobic zones of the biofilters is high 29 g h2s kg tcod in 17 and will typically result in a burst or pulse of h2s rojas tirado et al 2021 although o2 is continuously supplied to the system to maintain o2 saturation levels to satisfy fish demands anoxic areas may occur in zones with low water flow and accumulation of solid waste which can also create a basis for continuous h2s release and result in chronic exposure to h2s rojas tirado et al 2021 the hydraulic retention time in a typical ras is 30 40 min a b holan pers comm which means that some time is likely to pass before h2s produced in a specific area reaches the rearing tank this provides a relevant time frame for an applied treatment and its required efficacy the reported toxic concentrations of h2s differ between fish species and range from 0 034 to 1 4 mg l in marine fish species with varying tolerance levels depending on life stages temperature and oxygen saturation adelman and smith jr 1972 bagarinao and vetter 1989 smith et al 1976 the toxic effect in fish is exerted by diffusion of h2s from the ambient water over the gills where h2s easily penetrates cellular membranes hughes et al 2009 reiffenstein 1992 at the cellular level h2s impairs respiration by inhibiting the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase preventing the production of atp cooper and brown 2008 1 1 chemistry of h2s in an aqueous solution in an aqueous solution h2s exists in equilibrium between gaseous and aqueous phases h2s is one of three sulfide species present in water the others being the hydrosulfide ion hs and sulfide s2 the sulfide species exists in two equilibriums the fraction of each species present is a function of ph as follows 1 h 2 s h s h 2 h s s 2 h in addition to ph the h2s hs equilibrium is affected by the temperature and ionic strength of the water and the dissociation of h2s can be calculated when those values are known millero et al 1988 in saltwater the dissociation curve is slightly different than in freshwater as the pka1 decreases with salinity in seawater 15 c 35 the pka1 is around 6 6 which means that at ph below 6 6 h2s is the dominant species and above ph 6 6 hs predominates fig 1 millero et al 1988 s2 does not occur at ph values 10 making it irrelevant for aquaculture facilities which are typically maintained at ph ranges between 6 0 8 0 depending on salinity and the cultured species and life stage poxton and allouse 1982 removal of h2s can be achieved by oxidation using various chemical agents or by biological processes the latter includes altering conditions that favor oxidation of reduced sulfide compounds zhang et al 2008 since hs is the main reactive sulfide species the oxidation rate differs according to the ph as a function of the change in sulfide speciation hoffmann 1977 as a result of the high reactivity and prevalence of hs in higher ph ranges the oxidation rate is independent of ph greater than 8 zhang and millero 1993 the presence of h2s as both a gas and in an aqueous form provides the possibility to target the gaseous phase e g through degassing to remove h2s or the more reactive aqueous speciation hs by oxidation at ph 7 4 the majority of the h2s is present in its ionized form hs and by using the approach of oxidation for removal it is possible to target a larger pool of the problematic compound in production facilities the technology for the addition of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and oxygen o2 is commonly present on site where it is used to improve water quality and maintain fish welfare as such the approach is not technically demanding the respective compounds are already commonly used or present in aquaculture facilities for disinfection and oxygenation burridge et al 2010 oxidation of h2s in an aqueous solution leads to the production of sulfite so3 2 thiosulfate s2o3 2 and sulfate so4 2 with the distribution of the products varying according to the conditions of the solution the prevalence of the formed products from the oxidation of sulfide differs as a consequence of salinity ph and the concentrations of reactants with the two latter exerting the largest effect on product formation zhang and millero 1993 the initial product is so3 2 but it is generally found in small quantities because sulfite is rapidly oxidized to sulfate and the overall reaction can be reduced to morse et al 1987 3 h s 2 o 2 so 4 2 h the rate at which h2s is removed by o2 depends on the speciation of sulfide temperature the concentration of o2 and the presence of catalysts millero et al 1987 zhang and millero 1993 such as trace metals e g fe2 mn2 cu2 pb2 which exert a large effect on the oxidation rate due to their catalyzing effect vazquez et al 1989 oxidation rates can be further increased by adding compounds with greater oxidizing potential hydrogen peroxide h2o2 is a strong oxidizing agent and has been used in sewage systems to eliminate h2s and as a disinfectant hoffmann 1977 zhang et al 2008 the compound is generally considered environmentally safe as h2o2 decomposes into water and oxygen leaving no toxic residues h2o2 is also already widely used in the management of aquaculture systems to eliminate pathogens and improve water quality through disinfection bögner et al 2021 burridge et al 2010 the stoichiometry and kinetics of the oxidation of h2s by h2o2 have been examined in the context of wastewater treatment where the complete oxidation of h2s is achieved when h2o2 is added to h2s at a mole ratio of 1 1 4 1 cadena and peters 1988 the difference in the stoichiometry for h2o2 needed to completely oxidize h2s varies depending on the ph of the solution the rate limiting step is the reaction of h2o2 with hs which is consequently dependent on ph conditions as the speciation of sulfide is determined by the established equilibrium eq 1 millero et al 1989 accordingly the products formed from the oxidation of h2s by h2o2 including elemental sulfur sulfate and the intermediate polysulfides differ as a consequence of ph as shown in eq 4 and 5 hoffmann 1977 millero et al 1989 4 h s h 2 o 2 h 2 h 2 o s 5 h s 4 h 2 o 2 so 4 2 4 h 2 o h consequently oxidation of h2s by h2o2 either produces or consumes hydrogen ions depending on the ph hoffmann 1977 in the aquaculture industry it has been suggested that no3 reacts with h2s and converts h2s to so4 2 højgaard 2017 and that a source of no3 can be added to aqueous systems to remove h2s langeteig 2019 under conditions when no3 levels are low e g due to withholding of feed before the harvest due to the continuous development of environmentally sustainable ras which includes reducing the waste discharge from production no3 levels in ras already receive attention due to the management and elimination of nitrogenous waste which are generally high in ras van rijn et al 2006 thus adding more no3 to reduce h2s because of the assumption that no3 chemically oxidizes h2s is counterproductive the present study set out to evaluate the efficiency and applicability of o2 and h2o2 as a treatment for the removal of h2s in both seawater and industrial ras water as a secondary objective we tested whether no3 plays a role in the chemical oxidation of h2s or if the applicability of no3 is restricted to a reduction of h2s through biological oxidation to assess the potential of applying the tested oxygen donors o2 h2o2 and no3 for h2s removal the experiments were divided into three parts consisting of 1 comparison of h2s oxidation kinetics by o2 in the different water sources ultrapure water seawater and water from an industrial ras 2 the effect of h2o2 dosage in three ratios of h2o2 to h2s and the applied kinetics and 3 the effect of organic material and no3 on the removal rate of h2s 2 materials and methods 2 1 water three different water solutions were used for the experiments ultrapure water upw seawater sw with a salinity of 33 and ras water rasw of 35 table 1 ras water samples were collected from the outlet of the rearing

measurements were performed with a sulf 500 microsensor unisense denmark and measurements were recorded with the compatible software sensortrace logger the sulf 500 microsensors measure the partial pressure of h2s gas in real time the sensors were calibrated in the same water used in the experiment upw sw rasw and adjusted to ph 2 calibration was performed using a 6 point calibration ranging from 0 to 2 mg l r 2 0 98 before each new trial in the corresponding water type sulfide stock solutions with a concentration of 0 1 m total dissolved sulfide tds were prepared by dissolving na2s 9h2o sigma aldrich st louis mo usa in anoxic upw bubbled with nitrogen gas 2 3 experimental design 2 3 1 baseline oxidation rates in the first experiment 500 ml of air saturated water upw sw or ras was added to open glass beakers the experiments were carried out in a temperature regulated room at 13 3 0 2 c resembling the temperature in a salmon producing ras facility open beakers were used to allow for water air interactions and volatilization of h2s to imitate the condition in a ras upw served as a control for h2s oxidation rates beakers were gently stirred at 100 rpm using a magnetic stirrer ika germany and ph was adjusted to ph 7 4 0 1 by the addition of 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh sulfide stock solution was added to the beakers with a pipette in volumes yielding concentrations of either 1 2 or 4 mg l tds and values of h2s concentration were recorded every 60 s the experimental concentrations were chosen as they represent intermediate concentrations of the potentially produced h2s in the system and where fish mortalities occur upw was buffered with 0 02 m potassium phosphate buffer while sw and ras water were buffered with 0 02 m borax buffer to control ph during experiments ph levels and oxygen concentrations were measured and logged using an optical multi analyte meter and dedicated logging software pyroscience gmbh aachen germany 2 3 2 oxidation by h2o2 to evaluate the effect of h2o2 on the removal rate of h2s and if different dosages of h2o2 influence oxidation rate h2o2 was added at mole ratios of 1 1 2 1 or 4 1 h2o2 h2s following the addition of 1 2 and 4 mg l tds h2s concentrations were allowed to peak before adding h2o2 h2s peaks were identified by observing the sensor reading point where h2s concentrations stopped increasing at which point a 0 1 m h2o2 solution was added to achieve the desired h2o2 h2s mole ratio 2 3 3 nitrate and tcod in the third experiment 3 dilutions of industrial ras water were tested undiluted ras water 100 70 ras water and 45 ras water for dilutions ras water was mixed with seawater a water sample was taken before adding h2s and h2o2 ratio of 1 1 and after 6 h when the experiments were terminated samples for anions cations and total chemical oxygen demand tcod were collected and stored at 4 c before analysis 15 ml of water was filtered through 0 2 µm syringe filters filtropur s sarstedt germany and analyzed for

determination of tcod was performed using a test kit lck 1814 hach lange germany 2 4 data processing and calculations the fraction of h2s that is present in an aqueous solution as a function of temperature ph and ionic strength of the water was calculated by the equation 6 h 2 s tds 1 k h where tds is the concentration of total dissolved sulfide h 10 ph and k represents the effect of temperature and salinity and can be obtained from the equation derived from millero et al 1988 7 k 98 08 5765 4 t 15 0455 ln t 0 157 s 0 5 0 0135 s where t is the temperature kelvin and s is salinity at the experimental conditions of this study h2s will account for approximately 18 37 of tds depending on ph temperature and the ionic strength of the water with the highest fraction present in upw and decreasing h2s concentrations as salinity increases the general equation that characterizes the oxidation rate of h2s by o2 is a second order reaction morse et al 1987 however when o2 concentrations are in excess compared to h2s the oxidation rate can be described as a first order reaction zhang and millero 1993 8 d h 2 s dt k 1 h 2 s where t is time min 1 the rate k1 at which h2s is removed was calculated by log transforming data a regression line was fitted and the k value was obtained from the slope of the regression the half life t½ of h2s was thereafter calculated as 9 t 1 2 ln 2 k 1 where h2o2 was added the rate constant was calculated as zero order k0 and first order k1 because the rate of removal changed over time the initial data points followed a linear trend and were fitted with a zero order equation not substrate limited and linear regression r2 0 96 was performed to determine k0 half life was calculated as 10 t 1 2 a 0 2 k 0 where a0 is the initial concentration of h2s from the remaining values described by a first order reaction the rate constant was deducted according to the description above 2 5 statistical analysis all statistical analyses and graphs were performed using sigmaplot v 14 0 systat software inc the data were tested for differences between treatments aqueous solutions mole ratio of h2o2 h2s and dilutions of ras water and concentrations of h2s with a two way analysis of variance anova and followed by pairwise multiple comparison procedures holm sidak data were tested for normal distribution normality test shapiro wilk and homogeneity of variance equal variance test brown forsythe prior to anova differences were considered statistically significant when p 0 05 values are presented as mean s d 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of water characteristics on h2s as a result of the different chemical characteristics table 1 of the three solutions used the fraction of h2s present was affected similar to other gases the solubility of h2s is determined by the ionic strength of the solution which differs between the three experimental solutions the solubility of h2s decreases when salinity increases and the reduction in solubility is greater compared to o2 and co2 morse et al 1987 the influence of salinity on solubility can be seen from the initial concentrations in fig 2 each of the three treatments received a similar initial dose of 1 2 or 4 mg l tds as a result of the ionic strength of the water and the speciation of sulfide more h2s is present in upw compared to sw and rasw the calculated fraction eqs 6 and 7 of tds present as h2s at ph 7 4 and 14 c in upw sw and rasw was 36 20 and 20 respectively variations in temperature during the experiments were no more than 1 c table 3 and thus inconsequential for the speciation of h2s 3 2 oxidation of h2s by o2 in different aqueous systems the oxidation curves of h2s in the three experimental solutions are shown in fig 2 for each water type and the three initial concentrations of sulfide added 1 2 and 4 mg l tds the oxidation rates of h2s in fig 2 are best described by a first order reaction and the oxidation rates k1 obtained from the regression line r 2 0 95 were independent of h2s concentration within each treatment table 3 while oxidation kinetics of h2s were not influenced by the initial concentration of added sulfide there was a difference in removal rates between the treatments rates and t½ calculated eqs 8 and 9 from k1 differed significantly p 0 001 between the three water treatments where a considerably faster removal of h2s was observed in sw followed by rasw and upw table 3 the difference in removal rates and t½ due to the variability of the chemical composition of the three types of water illustrates the complex reactivity of h2s as a result of changes in the chemistry of the water the faster oxidation rates observed in sw compared to rasw were ascribed to the higher content of organic material in the rasw treatments compared to sw as reflected by their higher tcod the presence of organic matter and microbes that can interact with o2 compete with h2s and thus reduces the availability of o2 to oxidize h2s to exclude that the difference in oxidation rate between sw and rasw was caused by high concentrations of iron compounds fe2 and fe3 were measured trace metals influence the reaction rate through a catalytic effect on the rate of oxidation of h2s the effective concentration level of fe3 is 750 nm and is followed by visual precipitation of sulfides only fe2 exerts an effect at low concentrations 100 nm vazquez et al 1989 mean concentrations in rasw were 11 3 nm 0 63 µg l fe2 and 109 2 nm 6 1 µg fe3 l and the effect exerted by the low concentrations are modest the same applies in sw where concentrations were lower than required for precise determination the upw treatment had the slowest oxidation rate and served as a baseline for the oxidation kinetics as no trace metals are present and can influence the oxidation rate of h2s previous studies on sulfide chemistry and oxidation kinetics vary considerably in methodology and experimental design open vs closed beakers and conditions e g ph temperature oxygen content chelating agents and use of buffers direct comparisons between results can prove difficult as changing one variable can affect the kinetics of h2s this discrepancy due to the variation in experimental parameters is exemplified by millero et al 1987 where the reported t½ span from 2 h to more than 26 h our experiments were performed in open beakers which allowed for the volatilization of h2s g to imitate the conditions in an aquaculture facility the air water transfer rate is largely influenced by turbulence and ph and increases with turbulence and decreasing ph yongsiri et al 2004 both parameters were kept constant in the present study with low turbulence and a ph of 7 4 and any effect between treatments would be insignificant contrary differences in removal rates and t½ between experiments conducted in sealed beakers versus open beakers are expected and can explain some of the variability of the reported half lives by millero et al 1987 due to passive loss of h2s deleon et al 2012 3 3 effect of hydrogen peroxide on the oxidation kinetics of h2s the effect of adding h2o2 as an oxidizing agent to facilitate the removal of h2s from sw is demonstrated in fig 3 depending on the mole ratio the removal of h2s was accelerated in the first 10 30 min thereeafter the rate slowed down due to the fast initial removal of h2s the first part of the reaction was described by a zero order reaction maximum removal rate and the remaining part follows a first order reaction the difference between the kinetics observed in the first part of the reaction k 0 and the latter k 1 can be ascribed to the decomposition of h2o2 pedersen and pedersen 2012 additional to the reaction between h2o2 and h2s h2o2 oxidizes the organic material in the water thus decreasing the concentration of h2o2 over time as a consequence the h2s removal rate decreases as h2o2 is consumed which is reflected in the shift between rate constants and the kinetics that apply all three mole ratios of h2o2 h2s resulted in increased removal rates both in the maximum removal rate k 0 and the rate constant k 1 in the low h2o2 treatment ratio 1 1 k 0 was significantly lower p 0 001 than the ratios of 2 1 and 4 1 fig 4 a no effect on removal rate was observed between the latter showing that increasing the mole ratio above 2 1 did not further accelerate the maximum removal rate which indicates that when h2o2 is available in excess of h2s maximum removal rates are independent of the ratios of h2o2 h2s as a result when more organic material is present a higher h2o2 h2s ratio needs to be applied to compensate for the fraction of h2o2 that is consumed by the organic material the highest maximum removal rate of h2s measured was 0 052 mg min 1 with a t½ 8 2 min and was observed in the treatment with the highest added h2o2 dose mole ratio 4 1 tds 4 mg l the t½ calculated from rate constants k 0 eq 10 and k 1 eq 9 are summarized in table 4 regardless of a reduced effect of h2o2 after 10 20 min a difference between treatments persisted over time with an increase in the rate constants k 1 proportional to the increase in h2o2 h2s mole ratios fig 4 b the mean values for k 1 in ratios of 1 1 2 1 and 4 1 h2o2 to h2s were 0 025 0 034 and 0 045 min 1 respectively the effect of h2o2 on the removal rate was already significant p 0 001 at a mole ratio of 1 1 fig 4 b this suggests that h2o2 is present at concentrations necessary to maintain increased oxidation rates as the majority of the h2o2 reacting with the organic material is consumed during the initial part of the reaction shorter t½ of 16 20 min was found in the 4 1 treatment which was approximately half of the t½ found in 1 1 table 4 contrary to the dissimilarity between values of t½ for oxidation of h2s by o2 reported in the work by millero et al 1977 in seawater t½ 14 30 min for h2s in seawater spiked with h2o2 are similar to the t½ in this study table 4 this range makes the treatment feasible in saltwater ras where the hydraulic retention time hrt typically is 30 40 min the precise location in the ras loop where a h2s problem arises will influence the kinetics applied with respect to the required rate of removal and the h2o2 dose fig 5 zero order kinetics should be applied in the event of a h2s burst and where rapid removal is required a burst of h2s usually occurs in the biofilters where the production potential is high whereas the lower non acute concentrations are more likely to occur in the rearing tank at lower concentrations and during a steady increase or a chronic production of h2s in the rearing tank values of k1 are applicable as maximum removal rates are not required at low h2s concentrations this approach prevents a buildup of h2s leading to toxic concentrations and gives the production facility time to apply an emergency protocol such as withholding feeding and exchange of water in the system implementing the method requires a high sensitivity on line sensor to monitor h2s concentrations and a pump to dose h2o2 at the necessary volume and frequency the positioning of 3 sensors fig 5 that are connected to a feedback loop allows for a fast dose response to increasing h2s concentrations dosage of h2o2 is initiated when h2s exceeds the predefined safe levels of h2s 0 02 mg l and a dose response according to the k1 kinetics is initiated removal of 0 02 mg l of h2s by addition of h2o2 in a mole ratio of 4 1 requires a h2o2 concentration of 0 08 mg l assuming a removal rate k1 of 0 045 fig 4 b the remaining h2s is reduced to 0 0052 mg l after 30 min at concentrations 0 02 mg l k0 kinetics apply and administration of h2o2 in a mole ratio of 4 1 requires 0 12 mg l of h2o2 to remove 0 04 mg l of h2s assuming a rate constant k0 of 0 0013 mg l 1 min 1 derived from a linear regression performed on the values presented in fig 4 a h2s is reduced to 0 02 mg l after 15 8 min if applied to a system with a volume of 758 m3 and a flow of 1150 m3 h with a loss rate ke v q for h2o2 of 0 025 min 1 the addition of 1 l stock solution of 170 1 g l h2o2 will result in a h2o2 concentration of 0 22 mg l h2o2 dosage v e ke t after 10 min the h2o2 concentration is at 0 17 mg l and supplementary dosage is required to further reduce h2s to 0 02 mg l with a t½ of 15 8 min t½ 0 04 mg l 2 0 0013 mg l 1 min 1 for rapid removal of h2s h2o2 dosages can be repeated every 10 min for a total of 34 min where after h2s concentration is below 0 01 mg l assuming a repeated dosage of 1 l stock solution 170 1 g l h2o2 at times 0 10 20 and 30 min a total of 680 g h2o2 is needed using a h2o2 solution of 35 11 8 m 424 ml is used to produce 170 05 g l 5 m 1 l in total 1 7 l is needed at a cost of 58 22 kg containing 35 h2o2 novadan against a loss of 228 5 thousand if biomass is lost with a stocking density of 50 kg m3 and a market price of 6 per kg at rapidly increasing h2s concentrations maximum removal rates k0 must be maintained but the safe levels of h2o2 that can be applied differ between locations low doses of h2o2 up to 15 mg l do not have a negative impact on fish and biofilter performance and can be added without reducing system performance bögner et al 2021 in practice this means that if a 4 1 mole ratio of h2o2 h2s is applied 15 mg l of h2o2 will allow for the removal of 3 75 mg l of h2s in water with low tcod at higher tcod concentrations the removal potential of h2o2 is reduced as h2o2 is also consumed by the organic material due to the risk of adding h2o2 in concentrations higher than 15 mg l in the biofilter and because of the enzymatic degradation of h2o2 it is recommended to add h2o2 after the biofilter fig 5 this allows for higher dosages of h2o2 and reduces the potential of a bacteria mediated reduction of h2o2 in contrast a higher h2o2 concentration can be allowed in the rearing tank as salmonids are rather tolerant to short term exposure to h2o2 and 100 mg l is considered safe rach et al 1997 wood et al 2021 the above is provided as a generalization of the application of the treatment in practice but as all systems differ specific modifications in the dosage of h2o2 relative to system tcod and bacterial activity are necessary the increased rates due to accelerated oxidation of h2s are also apparent when observing oxygen saturation over time the oxidation of h2s results in a decrease in available oxygen fig 6 proportional to the removal rates and a steeper curve is observed as removal rates of h2s increase dosage of h2o2 in the absence of h2s results in an oxygen peak as the water becomes oversaturated however when h2s is present the peak in oxygen concentration is abolished as liberated oxygen rapidly reacts with h2s at the highest oxidation rate fig 6 c this leads to a reduction in dissolved o2 mg l by as much as 34 the oxidation of h2s is a continuous consumer of o2 which is a concern in relation to the removal of h2s as well as for the health and welfare of the fish in the production facilities 3 4 effect of tcod and nitrate in ras water fig 7 illustrates the zero and first order kinetics that describes the course of the reaction supplemented by the ln transformed data used to obtain the rate constant k1 removal rates of h2s were not affected by the rasw dilutions p 0 138 and the accompanying differences in water chemistry fig 8 similar to the previous experiments the addition of h2o2 increased the initial rate of removal and the first part of the oxidation curve was best described by zero order kinetics and the latter by first order the rate constant k 0 and the half lives derived from the values are listed in table 5 the rate independence of the different rasw dilutions indicates that organic material was still present in amounts that were high enough to retard the reaction between h2s and h2o2 as the oxidation rate was slower than that measured in sw therefore the efficiency of h2o2 seems to be reduced in the presence of organic matter or other compounds that can compete with h2s in the reaction with h2o2 that could be the case in waters with high bacterial activity where enzymes utilized by bacteria to decompose h2o2 such as catalase could influence rates due to enzymatic degradation of h2o2 pedersen et al 2019 demonstrated the effect of bacteria mediated h2o2 degeneration on the decomposition rate of h2o2 they reported a t½ for h2o2 in ras water of 29 4 min which compared to a t½ of 2 27 h in 0 2 µl filtered ras water shows a strong correlation between microbial activity and degeneration of the compound though neither maximum removal rate k 0 nor k 1 was influenced by dilution of the ras water the amount of h2o2 added had an effect on the removal of h2s half lives were found to be shorter p 0 001 for concentrations of 4 mg l tds fig 8 in the 45 and 70 treatments this could be explained by the higher volumes of h2o2 present that despite a fraction consumed by the organic material exist in quantities large enough to efficiently react with h2s the consequence of organic material on dosed h2o2 is evident when comparing the experiments conducted in sw and rasw fig 9 h2s was eliminated faster in sw compared to rasw by the addition of h2o2 where half lives on average were reduced by 75 and 49 respectively additionally the proportional reduction in t½ in untreated and h2o2 treated water was also significantly larger in sw compared to rasw fig 9 accordingly it seems reasonable to conclude that at increasing concentrations of organic matter measured as tcod a higher dosage of h2o2 is required for the removal of h2s due to the reaction with suspended organic particles the limitation of the practical use of h2o2 is predominantly due to the fast decomposition rate which renders it applicable for acute h2s treatment but the compound has no prolonged preventive effect chang et al 2007 nitrate has gained some attention as a method for controlling h2s within the aquaculture industry as it was hypothesized that h2s would react with no3 højgaard 2017 an effect that was supported by a lab scale study langeteig 2019 however the present study found no indication of such a chemical process as the initial no3 concentration did not decrease after the addition of sulfide table 6 in accordance with other studies mohanakrishnan et al 2009 yang et al 2005 our results indicate that no3 is not an oxygen donor that contributes to the oxidation of sulfide nonetheless no3 has the potential for controlling sulfide production and removal by biological oxidation both of which occur through activities of the microbial community but the process and effect is exerted over several hours to days torun et al 2020 wu et al 2016 which makes this approach ineffective as a treatment for managing an acute increase in h2s concentrations hence any benefit of maintaining a high no3 concentration is only relevant in the context of influencing the microbial community in oxygen depleted areas to favor the use of no3 instead of sulfate by srb and is not applicable as an acute treatment for removal of h2s 3 5 limitations and further research the study is limited by knowledge gaps of the response of atlantic salmon to increasing h2s concentrations and an examination of both behavioral and metabolic induced responses to identify the upper tolerance threshold to h2s is needed furthermore an assessment of the combined effect of h2s and h2o2 on the physiology of fish and the oxidation kinetics of h2s by h2o2 applied in a large scale experiment should also be accounted for before implementing h2o2 as a treatment in industrial ras 4 conclusion the obtained results demonstrate that h2o2 is an effective treatment for the removal of h2s and is suitable for application in seawater as the time required to achieve the desired effect on h2s is less than 30 min the efficacy of o2 within the normoxic range as a treatment for rapid removal of acute h2s is inadequate with half lives 100 min that exceed the general hydraulic retention time the effect of adding h2o2 is significant already at a mole ratio of 1 1 where t½ for h2s was reduced by 75 in sw and by 49 in rasw higher ratios of h2o2 h2s were shown to reduce half lives further although the achieved improvement is less substantial at higher ratios the applied dosage of h2o2 must be adjusted relative to the bacterial activity and organic load as liberated oxygen is consumed in the reaction with organic matter in the water higher ratios of h2o2 to h2s can be applied to compensate removal rates of h2s were not affected by no3 concentrations thus the addition of no3 in ras to increase the removal of h2s is not advised conclusively the proposed technology of h2o2 is a potentially effective method for fast removal of h2s and requires little technical equipment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgement thanks to ulla sproegel and brian møller for assistance in the lab and water analysis this study was

15661,anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr is considered an efficient technique for kitchen wastewater treatment however membrane fouling restricts their applicability in this study a novel anmbr with an fe anode and ti membrane cathode electro anmbr was constructed the reactor exhibited good performance in pollutant removal and antifouling in kitchen wastewater treatment compared with the traditional anmbr the electro anmbr increased phosphate removal by approximately 55 and reduced transmembrane pressure tmp by 50 coagulation from the fe2 fe3 released by the sacrificial anode increased the sludge floc size and porosity significantly reducing the membrane fouling potential in addition the lower amounts of extracellular polymeric substances eps in the electro anmbr due to an increased methanosarcina abundance facilitated membrane fouling mitigation almost no tmp difference was observed between the anmbrs with ti ceramic and polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes quantitative analysis using an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring indicated that the electrostatic repulsion between eps and cathodic membrane was positively correlated with the applied voltage in addition proteins in eps had a higher membrane fouling potential than polysaccharides and fe3 coagulation reduced adhesion capacity and alleviated membrane fouling this study provides a perspective viewpoint for anmbr membrane fouling mitigation and reactor design graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane bioreactor conductive membrane electrocoagulation antifouling quartz crystal microbalance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the amount of kitchen waste in asia has increased sharply and was projected to reach 4 16 billion tons in 2025 melikoglu et al 2013 especially in china the growth rate of kitchen waste has increased more than 10 zhang et al 2016 owing to the high moisture content 75 85 the effective treatment of wastewater from the extrusion or digestion processes is key to successful kitchen waste disposal the implementation of the garbage classification policy in china has increased kitchen wastewater treatment requirements for discharge into municipal sewers with high organic matter content volatile solids total solids vs ts 0 8 0 9 and good biodegradability of the kitchen wastewater ren et al 2018 anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr is considered a suitable technology for treating kitchen wastewater cheng et al 2018 anmbr has the advantages of higher biomass retention lower sludge production smaller footprint and increased bioenergy recovery zhen et al 2019 however membrane fouling is a major bottleneck in the application of anmbr dereli et al 2012 because of severe membrane fouling membrane costs in the anaerobic system account for the largest fraction 72 3 of the total life cycle capital costs which is significantly higher than that 25 60 for aerobic systems lin et al 2011 there are many methods to alleviate membrane fouling in anmbr such as the addition of coagulants and powdered activated carbon lei et al 2019 however the addition of chemicals complicates the maintenance of the reactor recently electrochemical methods have become potentially feasible for mitigating membrane fouling in anmbr electrocoagulation ensano et al 2019 and electrooxidation yang et al 2019a can effectively control membrane fouling by improving cake layer structure without adding any chemicals meanwhile applying voltage can regulate the microbial community in situ and further affect functional genes associated with the production and transport of extracellular polymeric substances eps which could change the concentration and composition of eps hou et al 2020 additionally the antifouling performance significantly enhances when the conductive membrane acts as the cathode because the electrostatic repulsion between the membrane surface and negatively charged pollutants restrains fouling adhesion dudchenko et al 2014 yang et al 2019b however the quantification of electrostatic repulsion on membrane fouling mitigation has rarely been studied previous studies have not comprehensively considered the effects of electric fields coagulation and conductive membranes in anmbr in this study a novel anmbr with an fe anode and ti membrane cathode electro anmbr was constructed to evaluate pollutant removal and antifouling performance in kitchen wastewater treatment the physicochemical properties of the sludge flocs and the composition of eps were measured to understand the antifouling mechanisms of the electro anmbr an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring eqcm d was used to quantitatively evaluate the effect of electrostatic repulsion on adhesion of eps to the conductive membrane surface this study may provide a reference for the performance and mechanisms of application of electro anmbr technology 2 materials and methods 2 1 electro anmbr setup the experiment was divided into four groups with different anmbr operating conditions and membrane materials each group of bioreactors

membranes respectively without an electrode or voltage voltage was provided by a dc power supply the simulated kitchen wastewater was fed into the reactors by gravity and the effluent was discharged using a peristaltic pump the gas collection bag was placed on top of the reactor to collect biogas from the anaerobic digester and membrane tank the ph and oxidation reduction potential electrode sensors were placed in an anaerobic digester for real time detection to prevent the reactors from collapsing changes in transmembrane pressure tmp were used to evaluate membrane fouling performance 2

demand cod nh4 n and phosphate concentrations are 20 000 600 and 80 mg l respectively which are close to the characteristics of actual kitchen wastewater reported in the literatures jeong et al 2017 zheng et al 2018 the expected organic loading rate olr was achieved by gradually increasing the influent concentration the anaerobic sludge was acclimated for approximately 35 days prior to the operation to ensure efficient pollutant removal and stable biogas production and the vs ts reached 62 7 with 11 280 mg l mlss and 7070 mg l mlvss the influent quality in different phase is shown in table 1 the peristaltic pump was maintained at 20 rpm to ensure a flow of 0 5 l d the membrane was replaced when its resistance was too high to meet the demands of the discharge flow 2 3

anthrone sulfuric acid and coomassie brilliant blue methods respectively a pressure sensor cyyz11 beijing star sensors china was used to measure tmp 2 4 eqcm d analysis eqcm d for this experiment

surface gold coated crystals qsx 338 coated with a titanium layer ti au coated sensors were simulated as a conductive ti membrane with a fundamental resonant frequency of 5 mhz the titanium layer rendered 48 nm thick by chemical sputtering the digital peristaltic pump tubing mounted on the qcm d was connected to a beaker containing eps solution that was injected into the sensor crystal chamber at 50 µl min the qcm d system connected to the electrochemical workstation was pre equilibrated with deionized water to establish a stable baseline following which the eps solutions were fed into the flow chamber for the next adsorption experiment a negative voltage was supplied through a two electrode system to the ti au coated sensor using the electrochemical workstation the amount of eps adsorbed onto the ti au coated sensor surface δm was directly correlated with the change in the oscillation frequency δf in accordance with the sauerbrey equation quevedo and tufenkji 2009 1 δ m c δ f

et al 2011 hashino et al 2011 bovine serum albumin bsa and sodium alginate were used to simulate eps at a concentration of 200 mg l the experiment was divided into three parts i the influence of different applied voltages 0 0 6 and 1 2 v on eps adsorption was investigated with an eps concentration of 200 mg l and a 1 2 polysaccharide to protein polysaccharide protein ratio which was

antifouling performance of the electro anmbr after approximately 180 days of operation the physiological conditions of sludge were stable and similar among the four reactors figs s1 and s2 the four reactors showed excellent pollutant removal performance for kitchen wastewater treatment fig 2 during the first 100 days the cod concentrations of effluents of the four reactors decreased gradually and then were stabilized between 200 and 550 mg l with a removal of 96 fig 2a subsequently when the olr was raised to 2 63 kg cod m3 d the anmbr ceram and anmbr pvdf reactors showed a temporary increase in effluent cod concentrations following which the cod concentrations of the four reactors stabilized between 200 and 700 mg l with a removal of 95 no significant difference was observed in cod removal among the four reactors anaerobic digestion and membrane filtration contributed to approximately 87 95 and 1 8 of cod removal respectively unlike cod the four reactors showed low nh4 n removal rates fig 2b due to the addition of fresh anaerobic sludge there were short term increases of nh4 n concentration in the four reactors from the 71st day to the 101st day however the electro anmbr showed higher phosphorus removal with the approximately 40 2 53 9 and 56 3 higher average removal rate compared with anmbr ti anmbr ceram and anmbr pvdf respectively fig 2c the sacrificial fe anode released fe2 to coagulate coprecipitate with po4 3 zhang et al 2018 which caused the removal of phosphorus from the electro anmbr the cumulative total iron concentrations in the electro anmbr and anmbr ti after 180 days were 7480 40 and 1507 27 mg kg wet sludge respectively and the ratio of fe2 to total fe in the supernatant was approximately 33 the formation of galvanic batteries in the iron plate as well as direct or h2 mediated metal microbe electron transfer through microorganisms enning and garrelfs 2014 lovley 2021 tang et al 2019 could release fe2 in the anmbr ti fe3 was the predominant species in the sludge liquor of the electro anmbr and anmbr ti which can be ascribed to iron oxidizing bacteria catalyzing the oxidation of fe2 to fe3 at circumneutral ph in microaerobic and anaerobic environments emerson et al 2010 the tmp trends in the four reactors over time are shown in fig 3 in the first 57 days the tmp rapidly reached a maximum when a new cycle of membrane fouling started followed by a stable value until the end of the cycle which could be ascribed to the small membrane area 40 cm2 after the membrane areas of the four reactors all increased to 80 cm2 the water flux was succeeded in maintained equally for all reactors and the electro anmbr exhibited the best antifouling performance after the 58th day the electro anmbr maintained a relatively low tmp which was 20 42 47 54 and 48 58 lower compared to anmbr ti anmbr ceram and anmbr pvdf respectively these results indicate that applying voltage and electrocoagulation favored the mitigation of membrane fouling in the anmbr the applied voltage can lead to a repulsive force that prevents negatively charged foulants from accumulating on the membrane surface xu et al 2021 electrocoagulation is presumed to influence the properties of sludge which could be beneficial for inhibiting membrane fouling zhao et al 2021 this mitigation strategy could contribute to energy savings thereby reducing the operating cost of the system the control reactor anmbr ti can also alleviate membrane fouling to a certain extent this result might be caused by iron coagulation which is consistent with a previous study that showed that applying zero valent iron zvi could significantly alleviate membrane fouling zhang et al 2020 nevertheless anmbr ceram and anmbr pvdf exhibited no advantages in membrane fouling control owing to the absence of applied voltage and electrocoagulation 3 2 sludge structure in the electro anmbr after 180 d anaerobic sludge samples were collected from the four reactors for further physicochemical characterization as shown in fig 4 the sludge flocs from the four reactors exhibited significant differences in morphology particle size and elemental composition the sludge flocs from the electro anmbr and anmbr ti fig 4a and 4b exhibited larger particle sizes and more porous structures which facilitated membrane fouling mitigation and water permeation chen et al 2006 in contrast sludge flocs in the anmbr ceram and anmbr pvdf fig 4c and 4d showed smaller particle sizes in addition the sludge flocs in the electro anmbr and anmbr ti showed larger bet specific surface areas and total pore volumes which could also contribute to the formation of a porous cake layer and higher water flux particle size distribution is another key indicator of the sludge morphology and structure the results of particle size analysis indicated that applying electric field and coagulation i e electro anmbr enlarged the sludge floc size efficiently with a mean size of 79 6 µm fig 5 a there was a significant increase in particle size at 224 4 µm while this was not seen in samples from the other three reactors the sludge floc size in the anmbr ti reactor was smaller than that in the electro anmbr 63 2 µm in contrast sludge flocs in the anmbr ceram and anmbr pvdf had a smaller particle size of 44 8 µm the dosing of fe ions increased the floc size because of the binding of colloidal organic materials with flocs and the decrease in repulsive forces between flocs via charge neutralization dong et al 2015 hou et al 2019 moreover the charged particles were polarized under the electric field favoring sludge floc aggregation and integration to form larger flocs su et al 2020 sun et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 larger particles have a lower fouling potential bani melhem and elektorowicz 2010 hou et al 2019 and contribute to the alleviation of membrane fouling the anaerobic sludge from the electro anmbr and anmbr ti was analyzed using xps to determine the fe containing species fig 5b the characteristic peak of the fe 2p3 2 xps spectra 710 3 ev was detected in the sludge from the electro anmbr and anmbr ti but the former had a higher peak intensity the peak of the fe 2p1 2 xps spectra 723 7 ev was only detected in the sludge from the electro anmbr this indicates that the sludge from the electro anmbr contained more iron than that of the anmbr ti due to the electrochemical process using the xps peak fit software the peak at 710 3 ev for fe 2p3 2 was divided to determine the fe containing species the results showed that fe oh 3 and fes were present in the electro anmbr sludge zhang et al 2020 fe oh 3 was generated by the reaction fe3 3oh fe oh 3 and fe3 was oxidized from zvi and fe2 by iron oxidizing bacteria fes was generated by the reaction fe2 s2 fes and s2 derived from sulfate reduction under anaerobic conditions these results indicate that the electric field induced the electrocoagulation and precipitation process in the electro anmbr which was conducive to the formation of larger sized particles and thus alleviated membrane fouling 3 3 eps composition in the electro anmbr after 180 d of operation the composition and concentration of eps in the four reactors varied considerably as shown in fig 6 a the amounts of polysaccharide in eps were 12 8 15 9 27 0 and 45 5 mg l and the amounts of protein were 24 3 25 3 50 2 and 117 0 mg l in the electro anmbr anmbr ti anmbr ceram and anmbr pvdf respectively the polysaccharide protein ratio was approximately 1 2 the eps concentrations of anmbr ceram and anmbr pvdf were higher than those of the electro anmbr and anmbr ti which was consistent with the trend of tmp this result was similar to that of a previous report on eps composition regulated by the anode potential hou et al 2020 eps are widely regarded as the main foulant for membrane biofouling in mbrs lee et al 2016 the electro anmbr with a lower eps concentration showed better resistance to membrane fouling than anmbr ceram and anmbr pvdf more iron flocs in the electro anmbr altered the structure and functionality of eps by occupying the binding sites or cross linking eps molecules through ion bridging rodriguez suarez et al 2020 metal eps interactions can lead to the formation of large molecular eps structures thus alleviating membrane fouling guan et al 2018 lin et al 2014 yu 2020 it is worth noting that eps content in the anmbr ceram and anmbr pvdf showed obvious difference while tmp is similar the results indicated that eps is not the determining factor of antifouling and this is consistent with the results from previous research jeong et al 2018 ftir spectrum analysis and three dimensional eem fluorescence spectra were used to further analyze the eps content and composition of the sludge from the four reactors as shown in fig 6b the same peaks were detected in the samples from the four reactors at 1013 1397 1647 and 1730 cm 1 however the peaks at 1450 and 1540 cm 1 were not detected in the electro anmbr sludge but were found in sludge from the anmbr ti anmbr ceram and anmbr pvdf the peaks at 1450 and 1540 cm 1 could be attributed to proteins and the peak at 1540 cm 1 was related to protein secondary structures nh deformation and cn stretching amide ii mahendran et al 2011 as shown in fig 7 eem was delineated into three excitation emission regions based on fluorescence that is ex 250 300 nm em 280 330 nm region a for tyrosine like substances chen et al 2003 he and hur 2015 ex 200 250 nm em 330 380 nm region b for tryptophan like substances li et al 2019 and ex 280 nm em 450 470 nm region c for humic like substances mobed et al 1996 regardless of the loosely bound eps and tightly bound eps the peak intensities of the three regions a b and c were the lowest in the sludge from the electro anmbr and anmbr ti followed by anmbr ceram and anmbr pvdf indicating that the contents of protein like and humic like substances in the four reactors were in the order electro anmbr anmbr ti anmbr ceram anmbr pvdf the results demonstrated a decrease in protein in the electro anmbr sludge which is in agreement with the eps analysis results eps production was related not only to applied voltage but also to microbial community structure the bacterial communities of the four reactors exhibited no significant difference fig s3 as shown in fig 8 there were four archaeal genera methanobacterium methanosarcina methanosaeta and methanoculleus in sludge from the electro anmbr anmbr ti anmbr ceram and anmbr pvdf among them methanobacterium and methanosarcina were the dominant genera in the four reactors and their relative abundances were greater than 96 the abundance of methanosarcina in electro anmbr 68 85 was significantly higher than that in anmbr ti 33 43 anmbr ceram 27 33 and anmbr pvdf 28 97 methanosarcina growth can be induced by long term fe3 dosage yin et al 2018 and the application of an electric field because of its capability of direct interspecific electron transfer rotaru et al 2014 methanosarcina produces lesser eps than methanobacterium grown on formate veiga et al 1997 these results implied that eps in sludge could be affected not only by iron coagulation but also by microbial species distribution resulting from the application of an electric field thus inhibiting the membrane fouling in electro anmbr 3 4 electrostatic repulsion between eps and conductive membrane eqcm d was used to quantitatively analyze the electrostatic repulsion between the membrane surface and eps polysaccharides and proteins and the adsorption capacity was used as the interaction index the influence of applied voltage on eps adsorption on the conductive membrane is shown in fig 9 a the adsorption capacity of eps on the ti au coated sensor was the largest 276 8 ng cm2 at 0 v the adsorption capacity was 100 8 ng cm2 at 0 6 v and 38 0 ng cm2 at 1 2 v which were 63 6 and 86 35 lower respectively than those when no negative bias was applied the adsorption capacity decreased significantly with an increase in the applied voltage owing to the enhancement of electrostatic repulsion between the cathodic membrane surface and the negatively charged pollutants the eps adsorption with different polysaccharide protein ratios under 0 6 v is shown in fig 9b the adsorption capacity of eps increased gradually with the increase of protein content and the maximum adsorption capacity reached 101 3 ng cm2 at a polysaccharide protein ratio of 1 2 this revealed that proteins might have a greater potential for eps adsorption membrane fouling owing to their higher hydrophobicity than polysaccharides wang et al 2006 eps containing highly hydrophobic proteins possess strong adhesion forces and thus tend to adhere more to membrane surfaces pores zhen et al 2019 in addition proteins are less biodegradable than polysaccharides which can result in more severe membrane fouling the influence of iron coagulation on eps adsorption is shown in fig 9c under the condition of no applied voltage the fe3 addition decreased the eps adsorption capacity by 87 2 while the adsorption capacity decreased by 31 3 at an applied voltage of 0 6 v iron coagulation significantly reduced eps adsorption on the conductive membrane surface thus reducing the cake layer thickness and alleviating membrane fouling iron coagulation can also reduce the viscosity of the sludge liquor zhao et al 2021 and increase the particle size of sludge flocs which may weaken the adsorption capacity ding et al 2018 the application of an electric field and iron coagulation were beneficial for inhibiting eps adsorption consequently mitigating membrane fouling in the electro anmbr in addition the proteins in the eps were more responsive to membrane fouling based on the above results membrane fouling mitigation in the electro anmbr was mainly achieved through three mechanisms fig 10 i enlarged particle size and porosity of sludge flocs through electrocoagulation which improved the cake layer structure and filtration performance ii decreased eps content which reduced the membrane fouling potential of the sludge liquor and iii enhanced electrostatic repulsion between the eps and cathodic membrane which resulted in a decrease in pollutant adhesion iron coagulation contributed more to membrane fouling than electrostatic repulsion at 0 6 v which reduced the eps adsorption capacity by 23 6 fig 9c therefore because of the abovementioned causes the electro anmbr reactor exhibited excellent pollutants removal of kitchen wastewater and the best antifouling properties 4 conclusion a novel anmbr with an fe anode and ti membrane cathode electro anmbr was constructed and operated in kitchen wastewater treatment for approximately 180 days compared with the traditional anmbr the electro anmbr exhibited more efficient phosphate removal which increased by approximately 55 and a lower tmp which reduced by 50 no remarkable difference was observed between the anmbr ceram and anmbr pvdf in the electro anmbr electrocoagulation enlarged the particle size and porosity of the sludge flocs thus improving the cake layer structure and membrane filtration performance meanwhile eps content and protein components were significantly decreased by the stimulation of microorganisms by applying an electric field which reduced the membrane fouling potential in the electro anmbr moreover quantitative analysis using eqcm d proved that the cathodic membrane significantly enhanced the electrostatic repulsion of eps and inhibited foulant adhesion on the membrane

15661,anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr is considered an efficient technique for kitchen wastewater treatment however membrane fouling restricts their applicability in this study a novel anmbr with an fe anode and ti membrane cathode electro anmbr was constructed the reactor exhibited good performance in pollutant removal and antifouling in kitchen wastewater treatment compared with the traditional anmbr the electro anmbr increased phosphate removal by approximately 55 and reduced transmembrane pressure tmp by 50 coagulation from the fe2 fe3 released by the sacrificial anode increased the sludge floc size and porosity significantly reducing the membrane fouling potential in addition the lower amounts of extracellular polymeric substances eps in the electro anmbr due to an increased methanosarcina abundance facilitated membrane fouling mitigation almost no tmp difference was observed between the anmbrs with ti ceramic and polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes quantitative analysis using an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring indicated that the electrostatic repulsion between eps and cathodic membrane was positively correlated with the applied voltage in addition proteins in eps had a higher membrane fouling potential than polysaccharides and fe3 coagulation reduced adhesion capacity and alleviated membrane fouling this study provides a perspective viewpoint for anmbr membrane fouling mitigation and reactor design graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane bioreactor conductive membrane electrocoagulation antifouling quartz crystal microbalance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the amount of kitchen waste in asia has increased sharply and was projected to reach 4 16 billion tons in 2025 melikoglu et al 2013 especially in china the growth rate of kitchen waste has increased more than 10 zhang et al 2016 owing to the high moisture content 75 85 the effective treatment of wastewater from the extrusion or digestion processes is key to successful kitchen waste disposal the implementation of the garbage classification policy in china has increased kitchen wastewater treatment requirements for discharge into municipal sewers with high organic matter content volatile solids total solids vs ts 0 8 0 9 and good biodegradability of the kitchen wastewater ren et al 2018 anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr is considered a suitable technology for treating kitchen wastewater cheng et al 2018 anmbr has the advantages of higher biomass retention lower sludge production smaller footprint and increased bioenergy recovery zhen et al 2019 however membrane fouling is a major bottleneck in the application of anmbr dereli et al 2012 because of severe membrane fouling membrane costs in the anaerobic system account for the largest fraction 72 3 of the total life cycle capital costs which is significantly higher than that 25 60 for aerobic systems lin et al 2011 there are many methods to alleviate membrane fouling in anmbr such as the addition of coagulants and powdered activated carbon lei et al 2019 however the addition of chemicals complicates the maintenance of the reactor recently electrochemical methods have become potentially feasible for mitigating membrane fouling in anmbr electrocoagulation ensano et al 2019 and electrooxidation yang et al 2019a can effectively control membrane fouling by improving cake layer structure without adding any chemicals meanwhile applying voltage can regulate the microbial community in situ and further affect functional genes associated with the production and transport of extracellular polymeric substances eps which could change the concentration and composition of eps hou et al 2020 additionally the antifouling performance significantly enhances when the conductive membrane acts as the cathode because the electrostatic repulsion between the membrane surface and negatively charged pollutants restrains fouling adhesion dudchenko et al 2014 yang et al 2019b however the quantification of electrostatic repulsion on membrane fouling mitigation has rarely been studied previous studies have not comprehensively considered the effects of electric fields coagulation and conductive membranes in anmbr in this study a novel anmbr with an fe anode and ti membrane cathode electro anmbr was constructed to evaluate pollutant removal and antifouling performance in kitchen wastewater treatment the physicochemical properties of the sludge flocs and the composition of eps were measured to understand the antifouling mechanisms of the electro anmbr an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring eqcm d was used to quantitatively evaluate the effect of electrostatic repulsion on adhesion of eps to the conductive membrane surface this study may provide a reference for the performance and mechanisms of application of electro anmbr technology 2 materials and methods 2 1 electro anmbr setup the experiment was divided into four groups with different anmbr operating conditions and membrane materials each group of bioreactors consisted of a 3 0 l continuously stirred cylindrical anaerobic digester 150 mm internal diameter and 180 mm height and a 0 80 l cuboid membrane tank 100 mm length 80 mm width and 120 mm height the operating conditions were identical in the anaerobic digesters but different in the membrane tanks in the electro anmbr fig 1 a conductive ti membrane 80 cm2 surface area and 0 22 µm pore size was used as the cathode and iron and graphite plates 60 mm 60 mm were used as the anode the electro anmbr applied a dc voltage of 0 6 v and the working time ratio of the iron and graphite anodes was 1 29 the configuration in the anmbr ti reactor was the same as that in the electro anmbr except for the open circuit anmbr ceram and anmbr pvdf used ceramic and polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf as filtering membranes respectively without an electrode or voltage voltage was provided by a dc power supply the simulated kitchen wastewater was fed into the reactors by gravity and the effluent was discharged using a peristaltic pump the gas collection bag was placed on top of the reactor to collect biogas from the anaerobic digester and membrane tank the ph and oxidation reduction potential electrode sensors were placed in an anaerobic digester for real time detection to prevent the reactors from collapsing changes in transmembrane pressure tmp were used to evaluate membrane fouling performance 2 2 simulated wastewater and operating conditions the inoculum was collected in the anaerobic digestion unit effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in beijing with the sludge treatment

run for approximately 180 days at a steady temperature of 37 1 c in a circulating water bath the reactor flux was 0 5 l d and the hydraulic retention time hrt was 7 6 d an expected chemical oxygen demand cod nh4 n and phosphate concentrations are 20 000 600 and 80 mg l respectively which are close to the characteristics of actual kitchen wastewater reported in the literatures jeong et al 2017 zheng et al 2018 the expected organic loading rate olr was achieved by gradually increasing the influent concentration the anaerobic sludge was acclimated for approximately 35 days prior to the operation to ensure efficient pollutant removal and stable biogas production and the vs ts reached 62 7 with 11 280 mg l mlss and 7070 mg l mlvss the influent quality in different phase is shown in table 1 the peristaltic pump was maintained at 20 rpm to ensure a flow of 0 5 l d the membrane was replaced when its resistance was too high to meet the demands of the discharge flow 2 3 physicochemical characterization of anaerobic digestion mlss and mlvss were measured according to standard methods gilcreas 1966 cod was measured using a hach spectrophotometer dr 3900 hach usa nessler s reagent is used for the detection of nh4 n and ammonium molybdate spectrophotometry is used for the detection of phosphate the particle size of the anaerobic sludge was measured using a

2010 followed by a three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem f 4600 hitachi japan and content analysis polysaccharide and protein the polysaccharides and proteins were quantified using the anthrone sulfuric acid and coomassie brilliant blue methods respectively a pressure sensor cyyz11 beijing star sensors china was used to measure tmp 2 4 eqcm d analysis eqcm d for this experiment consisted of a qcm d qe401 f1814 biolin scientific ab sweden and an electrochemical workstation chi760e a19721 ch instruments usa which was used to measure the eps adsorption capacity on the membrane surface gold coated crystals qsx 338 coated with a titanium layer ti au coated sensors were simulated as a conductive ti membrane with a fundamental resonant frequency of 5 mhz the titanium layer rendered 48 nm thick by chemical sputtering the digital peristaltic pump tubing mounted on the qcm d was connected to a beaker containing eps solution that was injected into the sensor crystal chamber at 50 µl min the qcm d system connected to the electrochemical workstation was pre equilibrated with deionized water to establish a stable baseline following which the eps solutions were fed into the flow chamber for the next adsorption experiment a negative voltage was supplied through a two electrode system to the ti au coated sensor using the electrochemical workstation the amount of eps adsorbed onto the ti au coated sensor surface δm was directly correlated with the change in the oscillation frequency δf in accordance with the sauerbrey equation quevedo and tufenkji 2009 1 δ m c δ f n where c is the mass sensitivity constant 17 7 ng cm2 hz at f 5 mhz and n is the overtone number 5 7 and 9 as the representative protein and polysaccharide in eps mentioned in some studies contreras et al 2011 hashino et al 2011 bovine serum albumin bsa and sodium alginate were used to simulate eps at a concentration of 200 mg l the experiment was divided into three parts i the influence of different applied voltages 0 0 6 and 1 2 v on eps adsorption was investigated with an eps concentration of 200 mg l and a 1 2 polysaccharide to protein polysaccharide protein ratio which was determined based on the results of the present study section 3 3 ii the influence of different polysaccharide protein ratios 1 2 1 1 and 2 1 on eps adsorption was investigated with an eps concentration of 200 mg l and applied voltage of 0 6 v iii the influence of iron coagulation on eps adsorption was investigated with an eps concentration of 200 mg l and polysaccharide protein ratio of 1 2 fe3 was supplied by fecl3 at a concentration of 7 mg l 2 5 microbial community analysis four sludge samples were collected from the anaerobic digester at the end of the experiment the sludge samples were cryopreserved at 80 c and analyzed for archaea communities using 16s rrna high throughput sequencing dna of the microbial community was extracted using the e z n a soil dna kit omega bio

amplifications were carried out using an abi geneamp 9700 pcr thermocycler abi ca usa illumina miseq pe300 sequencing service was provided by majorbio shanghai china 3 results and discussion 3 1 antifouling performance of the electro anmbr after approximately 180 days of operation the physiological conditions of sludge were stable and similar among the four reactors figs s1 and s2 the four reactors showed excellent pollutant removal performance for kitchen wastewater treatment fig 2 during the first 100 days the cod concentrations of effluents of the four reactors decreased gradually and then were stabilized between 200 and 550 mg l with a removal of 96 fig 2a subsequently when the olr was raised to 2 63 kg cod m3 d the anmbr ceram and anmbr pvdf reactors showed a temporary increase in effluent cod concentrations following which the cod concentrations of the four reactors stabilized between 200 and 700 mg l with a removal of 95 no significant difference was observed in cod removal among the four reactors anaerobic digestion and membrane filtration contributed to approximately 87 95 and 1 8 of cod removal respectively unlike cod the four reactors showed low nh4 n removal rates fig 2b due to the addition of fresh anaerobic sludge there were short term increases of nh4 n concentration in the four reactors from the 71st day to the 101st day however the electro anmbr showed higher phosphorus removal with the approximately 40 2 53 9 and 56 3 higher average removal rate compared with anmbr ti anmbr ceram and anmbr pvdf respectively fig 2c the sacrificial fe anode released fe2 to coagulate coprecipitate with po4 3 zhang et al 2018 which caused the removal of phosphorus from the electro anmbr the cumulative total iron concentrations in the electro anmbr and anmbr ti after 180 days were 7480 40 and 1507 27 mg kg wet sludge respectively and the ratio of fe2 to total fe in the supernatant was approximately 33 the formation of galvanic batteries in the iron plate as well as direct or h2 mediated metal microbe electron transfer through microorganisms enning and garrelfs 2014 lovley 2021 tang et al 2019 could release fe2 in the anmbr ti fe3 was the predominant species in the sludge liquor of the electro anmbr and anmbr ti which can be ascribed to iron oxidizing bacteria catalyzing the oxidation of fe2 to fe3 at circumneutral ph in microaerobic and anaerobic environments emerson et al 2010 the tmp trends in the four reactors over time are shown in fig 3 in the first 57 days the tmp rapidly reached a maximum when a new cycle of membrane fouling started followed by a stable value until the end of the cycle which could be ascribed to the small membrane area 40 cm2 after the membrane areas of the four reactors all increased to 80 cm2 the water flux was succeeded in maintained equally for all reactors and the electro anmbr exhibited the best antifouling performance after the 58th day the electro anmbr maintained a relatively low tmp which was 20 42 47 54 and 48 58 lower compared to anmbr ti anmbr ceram and anmbr pvdf respectively these results indicate that applying voltage and electrocoagulation favored the mitigation of membrane fouling in the anmbr the applied voltage can lead to a repulsive force that prevents negatively charged foulants from accumulating on the membrane surface xu et al 2021 electrocoagulation is presumed to influence the properties of sludge which could be beneficial for inhibiting membrane fouling zhao et al 2021 this mitigation strategy could contribute to energy savings thereby reducing the operating cost of the system the control reactor anmbr ti can also alleviate membrane fouling to a certain extent this result might be caused by iron coagulation which is consistent with a previous study that showed that applying zero valent iron zvi could significantly alleviate membrane fouling zhang et al 2020 nevertheless anmbr ceram and anmbr pvdf exhibited no advantages in membrane fouling control owing to the absence of applied voltage and electrocoagulation 3 2 sludge structure in the electro anmbr after 180 d anaerobic sludge samples were collected from the four reactors for further physicochemical characterization as shown in fig 4 the sludge flocs from the four reactors exhibited significant differences in morphology particle size and elemental composition the sludge flocs from the electro anmbr and anmbr ti fig 4a and 4b exhibited larger particle sizes and more porous structures which facilitated membrane fouling mitigation and water permeation chen et al 2006 in contrast sludge flocs in the anmbr ceram and anmbr pvdf fig 4c and 4d showed smaller particle sizes in addition the sludge flocs in the electro anmbr and anmbr ti showed larger bet specific surface areas and total pore volumes which could also contribute to the formation of a porous cake layer and higher water flux particle size distribution is another key indicator of the sludge morphology and structure the results of particle size analysis indicated that applying electric field and coagulation i e electro anmbr enlarged the sludge floc size efficiently with a mean size of 79 6 µm fig 5 a there was a significant increase in particle size at 224 4 µm while this was not seen in samples from the other three reactors the sludge floc size in the anmbr ti reactor was smaller than that in the electro anmbr 63 2 µm in contrast sludge flocs in the anmbr ceram and anmbr pvdf had a smaller particle size of 44 8 µm the dosing of fe ions increased the floc size because of the binding of colloidal organic materials with flocs and the decrease in repulsive forces between flocs via charge neutralization dong et al 2015 hou et al 2019 moreover the charged particles were polarized under the electric field favoring sludge floc aggregation and integration to form larger flocs su et al 2020 sun et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 larger particles have a lower fouling potential bani melhem and elektorowicz 2010 hou et al 2019 and contribute to the alleviation of membrane fouling the anaerobic sludge from the electro anmbr and anmbr ti was analyzed using xps to determine the fe containing species fig 5b the characteristic peak of the fe 2p3 2 xps spectra 710 3 ev was detected in the sludge from the electro anmbr and anmbr ti but the former had a higher peak intensity the peak of the fe 2p1 2 xps spectra 723 7 ev was only detected in the sludge from the electro anmbr this indicates that the sludge from the electro anmbr contained more iron than that of the anmbr ti due to the electrochemical process using the xps peak fit software the peak at 710 3 ev for fe 2p3 2 was divided to determine the fe containing species the results showed that fe oh 3 and fes were present in the electro anmbr sludge zhang et al 2020 fe oh 3 was generated by the reaction fe3 3oh fe oh 3 and fe3 was oxidized from zvi and fe2 by iron oxidizing bacteria fes was generated by the reaction fe2 s2 fes and s2 derived from sulfate reduction under anaerobic conditions these results indicate that the electric field induced the electrocoagulation and precipitation process in the electro anmbr which was conducive to the formation of larger sized particles and thus alleviated membrane fouling 3 3 eps composition in the electro anmbr after 180 d of operation the composition and concentration of eps in the four reactors varied considerably as shown in fig 6 a the amounts of polysaccharide in eps were 12 8 15 9 27 0 and 45 5 mg l and the amounts of protein were 24 3 25 3 50 2 and 117 0 mg l in the electro anmbr anmbr ti anmbr ceram and anmbr pvdf respectively the polysaccharide protein ratio was approximately 1 2 the eps concentrations of anmbr ceram and anmbr pvdf were higher than those of the electro anmbr and anmbr ti which was consistent with the trend of tmp this result was similar to that of a previous report on eps composition regulated by the anode potential hou et al 2020 eps are widely regarded as the main foulant for membrane biofouling in mbrs lee et al 2016 the electro anmbr with a lower eps concentration showed better resistance to membrane fouling than anmbr ceram and anmbr pvdf more iron flocs in the electro anmbr altered the structure and functionality of eps by occupying the binding sites or cross linking eps molecules through ion bridging rodriguez suarez et al 2020 metal eps interactions can lead to the formation of large molecular eps structures thus alleviating membrane fouling guan et al 2018 lin et al 2014 yu 2020 it is worth noting that eps content in the anmbr ceram and anmbr pvdf showed obvious difference while tmp is similar the results indicated that eps is not the determining factor of antifouling and this is consistent with the results from previous research jeong et al 2018 ftir spectrum analysis and three dimensional eem fluorescence spectra were used to further analyze the eps content and composition of the sludge from the four reactors as shown in fig 6b the same peaks were detected in the samples from the four reactors at 1013 1397 1647 and 1730 cm 1 however the peaks at 1450 and 1540 cm 1 were not detected in the electro anmbr sludge but were found in sludge from the anmbr ti anmbr ceram and anmbr pvdf the peaks at 1450 and 1540 cm 1 could be attributed to proteins and the peak at 1540 cm 1 was related to protein secondary structures nh deformation and cn stretching amide ii mahendran et al 2011 as shown in fig 7 eem was delineated into three excitation emission regions based on fluorescence that is ex 250 300 nm em 280 330 nm region a for tyrosine like substances chen et al 2003 he and hur 2015 ex 200 250 nm em 330 380 nm region b for tryptophan like substances li et al 2019 and ex 280 nm em 450 470 nm region c for humic like substances mobed et al 1996 regardless of the loosely bound eps and tightly bound eps the peak intensities of the three regions a b and c were the lowest in the sludge from the electro anmbr and anmbr ti followed by anmbr ceram and anmbr pvdf indicating that the contents of protein like and humic like substances in the four reactors were in the order electro anmbr anmbr ti anmbr ceram anmbr pvdf the results demonstrated a decrease in protein in the electro anmbr sludge which is in agreement with the eps analysis results eps production was related not only to applied voltage but also to microbial community structure the bacterial communities of the four reactors exhibited no significant difference fig s3 as shown in fig 8 there were four archaeal genera methanobacterium methanosarcina methanosaeta and methanoculleus in sludge from the electro anmbr anmbr ti anmbr ceram and anmbr pvdf among them methanobacterium and methanosarcina were the dominant genera in the four reactors and their relative abundances were greater than 96 the abundance of methanosarcina in electro anmbr 68 85 was significantly higher than that in anmbr ti 33 43 anmbr ceram 27 33 and anmbr pvdf 28 97 methanosarcina growth can be induced by long term fe3 dosage yin et al 2018 and the application of an electric field because of its capability of direct interspecific electron transfer rotaru et al 2014 methanosarcina produces lesser eps than methanobacterium grown on formate veiga et al 1997 these results implied that eps in sludge could be affected not only by iron coagulation but also by microbial species distribution resulting from the application of an electric field thus inhibiting the membrane fouling in electro anmbr 3 4 electrostatic repulsion between eps and conductive membrane eqcm d was used to quantitatively analyze the electrostatic repulsion between the membrane surface and eps polysaccharides and proteins and the adsorption capacity was used as the interaction index the influence of applied voltage on eps adsorption on the conductive membrane is shown in fig 9 a the adsorption capacity of eps on the ti au coated sensor was the largest 276 8 ng cm2 at 0 v the adsorption capacity was 100 8 ng cm2 at 0 6 v and 38 0 ng cm2 at 1 2 v which were 63 6 and 86 35 lower respectively than those when no negative bias was applied the adsorption capacity decreased significantly with an increase in the applied voltage owing to the enhancement of electrostatic repulsion between the cathodic membrane surface and the negatively charged pollutants the eps adsorption with different polysaccharide protein ratios under 0 6 v is shown in fig 9b the adsorption capacity of eps increased gradually with the increase of protein content and the maximum adsorption capacity reached 101 3 ng cm2 at a polysaccharide protein ratio of 1 2 this revealed that proteins might have a greater potential for eps adsorption membrane fouling owing to their higher hydrophobicity than polysaccharides wang et al 2006 eps containing highly hydrophobic proteins possess strong adhesion forces and thus tend to adhere more to membrane surfaces pores zhen et al 2019 in addition proteins are less biodegradable than polysaccharides which can result in more severe membrane fouling the influence of iron coagulation on eps adsorption is shown in fig 9c under the condition of no applied voltage the fe3 addition decreased the eps adsorption capacity by 87 2 while the adsorption capacity decreased by 31 3 at an applied voltage of 0 6 v iron coagulation significantly reduced eps adsorption on the conductive membrane surface thus reducing the cake layer thickness and alleviating membrane fouling iron coagulation can also reduce the viscosity of the sludge liquor zhao et al 2021 and increase the particle size of sludge flocs which may weaken the adsorption capacity ding et al 2018 the application of an electric field and iron coagulation were beneficial for inhibiting eps adsorption consequently mitigating membrane fouling in the electro anmbr in addition the proteins in the eps were more responsive to membrane fouling based on the above results membrane fouling mitigation in the electro anmbr was mainly achieved through three mechanisms fig 10 i enlarged particle size and porosity of sludge flocs through electrocoagulation which improved the cake layer structure and filtration performance ii decreased eps content which reduced the membrane fouling potential of the sludge liquor and iii enhanced electrostatic repulsion between the eps and cathodic membrane which resulted in a decrease in pollutant adhesion iron coagulation contributed more to membrane fouling than electrostatic repulsion at 0 6 v which reduced the eps adsorption capacity by 23 6 fig 9c therefore because of the abovementioned causes the electro anmbr reactor exhibited excellent pollutants removal of kitchen wastewater and the best antifouling properties 4 conclusion a novel anmbr with an fe anode and ti membrane cathode electro anmbr was constructed and operated in kitchen wastewater treatment for approximately 180 days compared with the traditional anmbr the electro anmbr exhibited more efficient phosphate removal which increased by approximately 55 and a lower tmp which reduced by 50 no remarkable difference was observed between the anmbr ceram and anmbr pvdf in the electro anmbr electrocoagulation enlarged the particle size and porosity of the sludge flocs thus improving the cake layer structure and membrane filtration performance meanwhile eps content and protein components were significantly decreased by the stimulation of microorganisms by applying an electric field which reduced the membrane fouling potential in the electro anmbr moreover quantitative analysis using eqcm d proved that the cathodic membrane significantly enhanced the electrostatic repulsion of eps and inhibited foulant adhesion on the membrane the coupling of electrochemistry and anmbr is a prospective technique for improving the effluent quality and mitigating membrane fouling declaration of competing interest this manuscript has not been

atmospheric environment change kamarul zaman et al 2017 wang et al 2018 and water quality change early warning chang et al 2015 backpropagation artificial neural networks bpanns are one of the most widely used ann models zhao et al 2021 the bpann is composed of one output layer one or more hidden layers and one input layer fig 1a the nodes of the input layer represent the input independent variables of the modeling and those of the output layer represent the dependent variables of the modeling the hidden layer includes several nodes simulating neurons to capture the nonlinear relationship of data the data transfer between all the network layers mentioned above is realized by a backpropagation algorithm the detailed principle of the algorithm is shown in fig 1b where all the relationships between two layers are also shown the back propagation algorithm refers to the algorithm in which the error calculated at the output side propagates back from the output layer to the hidden layer and then to the input layer qazi et al 2015 sazli 2006 in a backpropagation network each iteration consists of two steps calculating forward through the weight between two nodes w in fig 1 b to move forward and obtain a solution of the simulated value and propagating the error backward e r r in fig 1 b to modify the weights between nodes each node is passed through the transfer function which generates the activation value of 0 1 or 1 1 through the calculation of the transfer function after each node receives the weighted activation value from the nodes in the upper layer it propagates the new signal to the next layer until the node of the output layer guegan 1999 jia et al 2015 sazli 2006 xu et al 2015 therefore the difference in weight will greatly affect the prediction effect of the network and the reverse propagation error and the correction of weight will better achieve the prediction effect bpann has achieved the above effect very well chae et al 2016 guegan 1999 williams et al 1986 as far as previous work is concerned some researchers have used bpanns to predict cod removal in sewage treatment plants antwi et al 2018 hazrati et al 2017 for example hazrati et al 2017 successfully built a neural network to predict the cod removal efficiency in an mbr reaction system and the r2 reached 0 9999 however these works often need to use the detailed daily operation data of a special technology in a single wwtp dairi et al 2019 khatri et al 2020 ráduly et al 2007 this might make the work less practical because it is an isolated case study and the model cannot be applied in newly built wwtps a universal model for one certain technology would greatly increase the industrial application meaning furthermore the denitrification of sewage has attracted more attention than the removal of cod du et al 2017 but few works have focused on the denitrification efficiency and the model effect is poor guo et al 2015 therefore in the present work the daily water quality data the time span of 1 year of three wastewater treatment plants were adopted by using the a2o process in hefei china to establish a bpann model to predict the removal efficiency of ammonia nitrogen in the a2o process through standardized analysis and principal component analysis screening and mathematical transformation of the data were performed and the most suitable database was established for the construction simulation and operation of the bpann network after that the obtained bpann model was optimized by adjusting the network operation parameters and extended to the cast ao mbr sbr and od processes this work aims to set a method to build a universal bpann model that uses influent water quality properties to predict denitrification efficiency in wwtps by this method we could cover the gap to connect the influent and denitrification efficiency directly this is the first trial to set up a universal model for predicting the denitrification efficiency of wwtps adopting common biological processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 data processing water quality data from three different wwtps in the hefei area were collected all of which used the a2o process as the main water treatment process the data provided by the wwtps are in the form of a database each dataset includes data from the water treatment plant for 12 consecutive natural months from 2019 to 2021 mainly including input and outlet data for several major water quality indicators after removing abnormal and missing data points a total of 936 sets of data were used from three sewage treatment plants to verify the influence of the training ratio on the model 1473 data from other sewage treatment plants in china were used as references the wwtp details are provided in text s1 and fig s1 in the water quality data five input variables were selected including the inlet flow rate flow ph value ph ammonia nitrogen concentration an chemical oxygen demand concentration cod and total phosphorus concentration tp of the raw water there may be some potential linear relations between these data these linear repeated parts not only increase the meaningless calculation amount in the network calculation but also affect the calculation accuracy of the network to make the most of the specificity of the data in the network computation after the initial processing several in depth processing of the data was performed the treatment methods included standardized analysis zscore treatment and principal component analysis pca two common ways to reduce the impact between input variables the calculation formula of zscore method is shown as eq 1 1 z i x i μ σ where z i represents the standardized score x i represents a specific variable μ represents the mean of the set of variables and σ represents the standard deviation of the set of variables pca is a dimensionality reduction statistical method by orthogonal transformation the original vector group is transformed into a new vector group that is as linear as possible and then dimensionality reduction is carried out for the multidimensional variable system to achieve the purpose of simplifying the algorithm the implementation principle is shown as eq 2 2 p i z i c o v where z i represents the standardized numerical matrix before pca c o v is the covariance matrix of z i and p i is the numerical matrix after pca in this study these two methods are used to process the data and explore their influence on the accuracy of the network 2 2 modeling methodology this study was coded and run in the matlab r2019b environment the datasets were randomly divided into a training group a validation group and a test group to verify the predictive performance of bpann before modeling data groups were divided at different ratios to explore the influence of data group division on the results the neural network model algorithm adopts the back propagation algorithm which is composed of one output layer one hidden layer and one input layer the structure of this bpann model is shown in fig 1b the general expression equation of the bpann model is shown in eqs 3 5 which represent the general ann model transfer function for the hidden layer and transfer function for the output layer respectively 3 a w p b 4 f p t r a n s i d p 2 1 e 2 p 1 5 a p u r e l i n p where a is the activation value as well as the output variable w p represents the weight matrix connecting the input variable and the hidden neuron namely the weight matrix connecting the hidden neuron and the output variable b is the error matrix in the neural network and p is the set of input variables there are many values to evaluate the network effect in this experiment the mean average percentage error mape was chosen as the standard to compare the model performance its calculation formula is as shown in eq 6 6 mape 100 n a i s i a i where n equals the number of test sets s i is the simulated output value of data points and a i represents the actual output value of data points the model applied the sigmoid transfer function and linear output neurons taheri et al 2021 the influence of other common parameters such as training functions neurons and learning rates was explored in this research 2 3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis refers to the difference between network simulation results and actual results if a condition is assumed to be missing the missing data are replaced by the mean data it is calculated according to eq 7 with sensitivity analysis the influence of each independent variable on the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen was analyzed the higher the sensitivity is the greater its influence on the model 7 a k 100 1 s k v v where a k is the sensitivity of variable k s k is the network simulation value after missing variable and v is the analog value of the original network 2 4 training ratio influence on different scenarios according to the above modeling method several wwtps across china were studied which adopted different sewage treatment schemes including od mbr sbr and cast by comparing the effects of networks after different training group ratios the optimal training group division ratio was explored for different treatment technologies 2 5 specificity analysis to verify the specificity of the obtained networks based on different water treatment processes a specificity analysis was carried out by feeding datum groups extracted from one of the five kinds of water treatment processes a2o od sbr mbr and cast they were plugged into the networks and the mape value was calculated 2 6 industrial verification the bpann model was used in the design of a real wwtp zipeng wwtp hefei china using the a2o process on the basis of the water quality data of the influent and the required ammonia nitrogen removal rate the main parameters of the wwtp are listed in table s2 we first calculated the simulated denitrification efficiency by the bpann according to the water properties of the influent the results suggest that the a2o process is more suitable for wwtps then we optimized the carbon resource by the model to increase the denitrification efficiency when the wwtp was in a pilot run we recorded the real denitrification efficiency and compared it with the simulated denitrification efficiency 3 results and discussion 3 1 preliminary data analysis and processing methods 3 1 1 data standardization the data of each sewage treatment were pretreated separately the first step was to remove outliers from trusted data that were within three standard deviations above or below the mean value of the data according to the 3σ criterion in gaussian distribution boyd 2010 higgins et al 2020 linear transformation of the five variables was carried out according to the standardized method so that their input values were kept at the same order of magnitude without affecting the credibility of the data the distribution diagram of the five variables is shown in fig s2 3 1 2 pca after standardization we performed pca on the data the results of pca are shown in fig 2a the first three principal components accounted for 36 63 26 06 and 19 57 of the total components the loading of the five principal components is shown in fig 2b f after pca dimension reduction the linear relationship among the five variables after recombination was greatly reduced then we trained models for the following four raw data processing methods no processing standardized processing and pca processing after which the components occupying more than 85 namely the first four components were selected after preliminary modeling we obtained the mape for the four treatments as shown in table 2 the network obtained after principal component analysis reached the lowest mape value if only 85 of the main component was taken although two dimensions could be reduced the error would increase at the same time therefore the data after principal component analysis were selected as the main method for subsequent verification 3 2 model parameter optimization after the preliminary optimization of the data we optimized the details of the bpann in the parameter optimization stage we chose the data of one wwtp as an example to reduce the amount of data and make the calculation faster during the study we randomly divided the database into three groups the training group the verification group and the test group for some training functions the verification group might be merged with the training group at this point the division ratio was 70 15 15 the minimum error longest training time and maximum number of failures were not limited during training and the maximum number of training times was set at 1000 times to achieve the best network training effect as shown in fig 3a the back propagation algorithm of the bayesian rule trainbr has the best performance this is because it minimizes the combination of square error and weight next the effect of the number of neurons on the accuracy of the network was investigated first we studied the influence when there were 10 100 neurons as shown in fig 3b then we narrowed the range to 20 neurons as shown in fig 3c when the number of neurons is less than the number of input variables the error gradually increases this is because the dimension of the variable decreases after the combination of neuron nodes in the hidden layer as the number of neurons increases the accuracy of the network generally increases and reaches the highest value when the number of neurons is 10 however the subsequent increase in the error is probably due to the overfitting of the training group during the training period which is consistent with previous work chen et al 2020 ma et al 2021 in this situation the error of the test group will be remarkably higher than before therefore the number of neurons should not be too large and 10 is the best then we optimized the learning rate of the neural network in the neural network training process if the same weight is always used in each iteration the neural network cannot have a good self optimization effect therefore the learning rate is introduced as the controller to modify the weight the learning rate is a dimensionless number in the range 0 1 the smaller the learning rate is the smaller the weight change in each iteration will be and as a result the network will be biased to overfit which will reduce the network effect in contrast the larger the learning rate is the larger the weight change will be in each iteration the network will undergo an excessive correction and the network accuracy will be correspondingly reduced since the commonly used learning rate value is less than 0 1 the learning rate is limited to 0 0 1 in the work and the influence of the learning rate on the network accuracy is compared as shown in fig 3d the optimized learning rate is 0 030 after the above screening we determined the optimal neural network model conditions that is after the principal component analysis the bayesian algorithm was selected 10 neurons were selected the learning rate was 0 03 the maximum training time maximum failure times and minimum error were not limited and the maximum training times were 1000 times 3 3 model performance evaluation we used the database of three wwtps that use the a2o process and combined them to establish a database that is more common to the a2o process the effect is shown in fig 4a while the details of the process of net building are shown in fig s3 and s4 the net reaches an accuracy where the mape value equals 0 7675 we can also see that except for some relatively extreme values the results of network fitting are basically within the error range of 1 above and below the target value which shows that our model is quite accurate compared to published work qiao et al 2020 bpann reduced the mape value significantly compared with the other four ml methods table s1 the bpann model could adjust the weight in the training process differently at the same hyperparameters which could lead to diverse results and we could select the most effective net elm rf and svm models have more complex structures which would overfit during the training process and reduce the robustness of the model we also explored the influence of different training data partition ratios on the results as shown in fig 4b by increasing or decreasing the ratio of training data the networks with the ratio of training group and test group 50 50 60 40 80 20 and 90 10 were established after comparing them we found that the accuracy increased at first and then decreased with the increase in the proportion of training groups this is because when the training group is too small the data cannot well reflect the changing trend of the overall data while the proportion of the training group is too large and the network exhibits overfitting 3 4 training ratio influence and sensitivity analysis based on the above results we found that for the same network parameters different proportions of training group partitions would have a certain impact on the network results and the accuracy of the network would not necessarily improve with the increase in the proportion of training group partitions in other words there is an optimal model training ratio for the aforementioned network the training ratio is 70 30 we wanted to know if this value was only for the a2o process therefore we looked for the water quality data of wwtps using other water treatment processes from china and optimized the modeling of their network parameters according to the above modeling method as shown in fig 5 we can see that there are differences in the influence of training group proportion on the network for different technologies for the od process and cast process the network error decreases gradually with the increase in the proportion of training groups for sbr and mbr processes similar to a2o processes the network errors increase when the training proportions increase which is caused by overfitting as mentioned above when the proportion of training groups is too large abnormal data values in the training group may cause a decline in the network fitting effect which is normal in the establishment of neural networks for the od and cast processes this is not the case which may be because the daily operation data of these two processes are more unstable and there are more abnormal data in the dataset which makes the prediction reliability of the network of these two processes smaller and the impact of errors greater however the network established for sbr and mbr can minimize the influence of extreme values on them at the optimal ratio which enables them to obtain a more universal network and make more reliable predictions table 3 shows the differences in their optimal training ratios for different sewage treatment processes additionally a sensitivity analysis aimed at the a2o process was performed and the results are shown in fig 4c it can be seen clearly that cod makes a great contribution in the network and the sensitivity value equals 97 37 while total phosphorus and ammonia nitrogen have very little influence and the influence of flow and ph is quite weak this is interesting because the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen is not greatly affected by the original ammonia nitrogen but the cod in inlet water this might prove that cod is the quantity of greatest concern during water treatment 3 5 specificity analysis in the above we have established a network model for each different wastewater treatment process to explore the specificity of these models we substituted the factory data of different processes into the model and calculated its mape value according to table 4 it is obvious that when the production process and the network model are the same the network accuracy is the highest and the mape values except those of the cast process are all below 1 which verifies the unity of the network models this indicates that the model established in this work has a high specificity 3 6 industrial verification in the newly built wwtp the water quality data were measured by the local government table s2 the data from april 2021 were screened out because the inflow properties were abnormal and out of the working range of the model the measured ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency and simulated efficiency using the bpann model are shown in fig s5 the mape value of all 20 testing data points is 0 9486 this indicates that the model has a better consistency with the daily operations of wwtps 4 conclusion in this study a bpann model with high accuracy for the a2o process was developed the ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency of wwtps was successfully predicted by using five variables inlet flow rate ph value ammonia nitrogen concentration cod concentration and total phosphorus concentration in the same method we built the bpann model for four other processes 1 the a2o bpann could reach an accuracy of 0 7675 mean average percentage error 2 the cod concentration reached the highest sensitivity of 97 37 in all five variables used in the model 3 by optimizing the training data ratios the bpann for od sbr mbr and cast processes could reduce the mean average percentage error to 0 5727 1 0040 0 0669 and 0 3650 respectively 4 further calculation indicates that the bpann for each process has high specificity and 5 the industrial experiment proved that the model has good industrial applications in which the mape reached 0 9486 overall the model could be used to choose the optimum treatment process in new wwtp designs or take action in advance to avoid the risk of excessive emissions when wwtps are subjected to sudden shocks declaration of competing interest

1 b to move forward and obtain a solution of the simulated value and propagating the error backward e r r in fig 1 b to modify the weights between nodes each node is passed through the transfer function which generates the activation value of 0 1 or 1 1 through the calculation of the transfer function after each node receives the weighted activation value from the nodes in the upper layer it propagates the new signal to the next layer until the node of the output layer guegan 1999 jia et al 2015 sazli 2006 xu et al 2015 therefore the difference in weight will greatly affect the prediction effect of the network and the reverse propagation error and the correction of weight will better achieve the prediction effect bpann has achieved the above effect very well chae et al 2016 guegan 1999 williams et al 1986 as far as previous work is concerned some researchers have used bpanns to predict cod removal in sewage treatment plants antwi et al 2018 hazrati et al 2017 for example hazrati et al 2017 successfully built a neural network to predict the cod removal efficiency in an mbr reaction system and the r2 reached 0 9999 however these works often need to use the detailed daily operation data of a special technology in a single wwtp dairi et al 2019 khatri et al 2020 ráduly et al 2007 this might make the work less practical because it is an isolated case study and the model cannot be applied in newly built wwtps a universal model for one certain technology would greatly increase the industrial application meaning furthermore the denitrification of sewage has attracted more attention than the removal of cod du et al 2017 but few works have focused on the denitrification efficiency and the model effect is poor guo et al 2015 therefore in the present work the daily water quality data the time span of 1 year of three wastewater treatment plants were adopted by using the a2o process in hefei china to establish a bpann model to predict the removal efficiency of ammonia nitrogen in the a2o process through standardized analysis and principal component analysis screening and mathematical transformation of the data were performed and the most suitable database was established for the construction simulation and operation of the bpann network after that the obtained bpann model was optimized by adjusting the network operation parameters and extended to the cast ao mbr sbr and od processes this work aims to set a method to build a universal bpann model that uses influent water quality properties to predict denitrification efficiency in wwtps by this method we could cover the gap to connect the influent and denitrification efficiency directly this is the first trial to set up a universal model for predicting the denitrification efficiency of wwtps adopting common biological processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 data processing water quality data from three different wwtps in the hefei area were collected all of which used the a2o process as the main water treatment process the data provided by the wwtps are in the form of a database each dataset includes data from the water treatment plant for 12 consecutive natural months from 2019 to 2021 mainly including input and outlet data for several major water quality indicators after removing abnormal and missing data points a total of 936 sets of data were used from three sewage treatment plants to verify the influence of the training ratio on the model 1473 data from other sewage treatment plants in china were used as references the wwtp details are provided in text s1 and fig s1 in the water quality data five input variables were selected including the inlet flow rate flow ph value ph ammonia nitrogen concentration an chemical oxygen demand concentration cod and total phosphorus concentration tp of the raw water there may be some potential linear relations between these data these linear repeated parts not only increase the meaningless calculation amount in the network calculation but also affect the calculation accuracy of the network to make the most of the specificity of the data in the network computation after the initial processing several in depth processing of the data was performed the treatment methods included standardized analysis zscore treatment and principal component analysis pca two common ways to reduce the impact between input variables the calculation formula of zscore method is shown as eq 1 1 z i x i μ σ where z i represents the standardized score x i represents a specific variable μ represents the mean of the set of variables and σ represents the standard deviation of the set of variables pca is a dimensionality reduction statistical method by orthogonal transformation the original vector group is transformed into a new vector group that is as linear as possible and then dimensionality reduction is carried out for the multidimensional variable system to achieve the purpose of simplifying the algorithm the implementation principle is shown as eq 2 2 p i z i c o v where z i represents the standardized numerical matrix before pca c o v is the covariance matrix of z i and p i is the numerical matrix after pca in this study these two methods are used to process the data and explore their influence on the accuracy of the network 2 2 modeling methodology this study was coded and run in the matlab r2019b environment the datasets were randomly divided into a training group a validation group and a test group to verify the predictive performance of bpann before modeling data groups were divided at different ratios to explore the influence of data group division on the results the neural network model algorithm adopts the back propagation algorithm which is composed of one output layer one hidden layer and one input layer the structure of this bpann model is shown in fig 1b the general expression equation of the bpann model is shown in eqs 3 5 which represent the general ann model transfer function for the hidden layer and transfer function for the output layer respectively 3 a w p b 4 f p t r a n s i d p 2 1 e 2 p 1 5 a p u r e l i n p where a is the activation value as well as the output variable w p represents the weight matrix connecting the input variable and the hidden neuron namely the weight matrix connecting the hidden neuron and the output variable b is the error matrix in the neural network and p is the set of input variables there are many values to evaluate the network effect in this experiment the mean average percentage error mape was chosen as the standard to compare the model performance its calculation formula is as shown in eq 6 6 mape 100 n a i s i a i where n equals the number of test sets s i is the simulated output value of data points and a i represents the actual output value of data points the model applied the sigmoid transfer function and linear output neurons taheri et al 2021 the influence of other common parameters such as training functions neurons and learning rates was explored in this research 2 3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis refers to the difference between network simulation results and actual results if a condition is assumed to be missing the missing data are replaced by the mean data it is calculated according to eq 7 with sensitivity analysis the influence of each independent variable on the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen was analyzed the higher the sensitivity is the greater its influence on the model 7 a k 100 1 s k v v where a k is the sensitivity of variable k s k is the network simulation value after missing variable and v is the analog value of the original network 2 4 training ratio influence on different scenarios according to the above modeling method several wwtps across china were studied which adopted different sewage treatment schemes including od mbr sbr and cast by comparing the effects of networks after different training group ratios the optimal training group division ratio was explored for different treatment technologies 2 5 specificity analysis to verify the specificity of the obtained networks based on different water treatment processes a specificity analysis was carried out by feeding datum groups extracted from one of the five kinds of water treatment processes a2o od sbr mbr and cast they were plugged into the networks and the mape value was calculated 2 6 industrial verification the bpann model was used in the design of a real wwtp zipeng wwtp hefei china using the a2o process on the basis of the water quality data of the influent and the required ammonia nitrogen removal rate the main parameters of the wwtp are listed in table s2 we first calculated the simulated denitrification efficiency by the bpann according to the water properties of the influent the results suggest that the a2o process is more suitable for wwtps then we optimized the carbon resource by the model to increase the denitrification efficiency when the wwtp was in a pilot run we recorded the real denitrification efficiency and compared it with the simulated denitrification efficiency 3 results and discussion 3 1 preliminary data analysis and processing methods 3 1 1 data standardization the data of each sewage treatment were pretreated separately the first step was to remove outliers from trusted data that were within three standard deviations above or below the mean value of the data according to the 3σ criterion in gaussian distribution boyd 2010 higgins et al 2020 linear transformation of the five variables was carried out according to the standardized method so that their input values were kept at the same order of magnitude without affecting the credibility of the data the distribution diagram of the five variables is shown in fig s2 3 1 2 pca after standardization we performed pca on the data the results of pca are shown in fig 2a the first three principal components accounted for 36 63 26 06 and 19 57 of the total components the loading of the five principal components is shown in fig 2b f after pca dimension reduction the linear relationship among the five variables after recombination was greatly reduced then we trained models for the following four raw data processing methods no processing standardized processing and pca processing after which the components occupying more than 85 namely the first four components were selected after preliminary modeling we obtained the mape for the four treatments as shown in table 2 the network obtained after principal component analysis reached the lowest mape value if only 85 of the main component was taken although two dimensions could be reduced the error would increase at the same time therefore the data after principal component analysis were selected as the main method for subsequent verification 3 2 model parameter optimization after the preliminary optimization of the data we optimized the details of the bpann in the parameter optimization stage we chose the data of one wwtp as an example to reduce the amount of data and make the calculation faster during the study we randomly divided the database into three groups the training group the verification group and the test group for some training functions the verification group might be merged with the training group at this point the division ratio was 70 15 15 the minimum error longest training time and maximum number of failures were not limited during training and the maximum number of training times was set at 1000 times to achieve the best network training effect as shown in fig 3a the back propagation algorithm of the bayesian rule trainbr has the best performance this is because it minimizes the combination of square error and weight next the effect of the number of neurons on the accuracy of the network was investigated first we studied the influence when there were 10 100 neurons as shown in fig 3b then we narrowed the range to 20 neurons as shown in fig 3c when the number of neurons is less than the number of input variables the error gradually increases this is because the dimension of the variable decreases after the combination of neuron nodes in the hidden layer as the number of neurons increases the accuracy of the network generally increases and reaches the highest value when the number of neurons is 10 however the subsequent increase in the error is probably due to the overfitting of the training group during the training period which is consistent with previous work chen et al 2020 ma et al 2021 in this situation the error of the test group will be remarkably higher than before therefore the number of neurons should not be too large and 10 is the best then we optimized the learning rate of the neural network in the neural network training process if the same weight is always used in each iteration the neural network cannot have a good self optimization effect therefore the learning rate is introduced as the controller to modify the weight the learning rate is a dimensionless number in the range 0 1 the smaller the learning rate is the smaller the weight change in each iteration will be and as a result the network will be biased to overfit which will reduce the network effect in contrast the larger the learning rate is the larger the weight change will be in each iteration the network will undergo an excessive correction and the network accuracy will be correspondingly reduced since the commonly used learning rate value is less than 0 1 the learning rate is limited to 0 0 1 in the work and the influence of the learning rate on the network accuracy is compared as shown in fig 3d the optimized learning rate is 0 030 after the above screening we determined the optimal neural network model conditions that is after the principal component analysis the bayesian algorithm was selected 10 neurons were selected the learning rate was 0 03 the maximum training time maximum failure times and minimum error were not limited and the maximum training times were 1000 times 3 3 model performance evaluation we used the database of three wwtps that use the a2o process and combined them to establish a database that is more common to the a2o process the effect is shown in fig 4a while the details of the process of net building are shown in fig s3 and s4 the net reaches an accuracy where the mape value equals 0 7675 we can also see that except for some relatively extreme values the results of network fitting are basically within the error range of 1 above and below the target value which shows that our model is quite accurate compared to published work qiao et al 2020 bpann reduced the mape value significantly compared with the other four ml methods table s1 the bpann model could adjust the weight in the training process differently at the same hyperparameters which could lead to diverse results and we could select the most effective net elm rf and svm models have more complex structures which would overfit during the training process and reduce the robustness of the model we also explored the influence of different training data partition ratios on the results as shown in fig 4b by increasing or decreasing the ratio of training data the networks with the ratio of training group and test group 50 50 60 40 80 20 and 90 10 were established after comparing them we found that the accuracy increased at first and then decreased with the increase in the proportion of training groups this is because when the training group is too small the data cannot well reflect the changing trend of the overall data while the proportion of the training group is too large and the network exhibits overfitting 3 4 training ratio influence and sensitivity analysis based on the above results we found that for the same network parameters different proportions of training group partitions would have a certain impact on the network results and the accuracy of the network would not necessarily improve with the increase in the proportion of training group partitions in other words there is an optimal model training ratio for the aforementioned network the training ratio is 70 30 we wanted to know if this value was only for the a2o process therefore we looked for the water quality data of wwtps using other water treatment processes from china and optimized the modeling of their network parameters according to the above modeling method as shown in fig 5 we can see that there are differences in the influence of training group proportion on the network for different technologies for the od process and cast process the network error decreases gradually with the increase in the proportion of training groups for sbr and mbr processes similar to a2o processes the network errors increase when the training proportions increase which is caused by overfitting as mentioned above when the proportion of training groups is too large abnormal data values in the training group may cause a decline in the network fitting effect which is normal in the establishment of neural networks for the od and cast processes this is not the case which may be because the daily operation data of these two processes are more unstable and there are more abnormal data in the dataset which makes the prediction reliability of the network of these two processes smaller and the impact of errors greater however the network established for sbr and mbr can minimize the influence of extreme values on them at the optimal ratio which enables them to obtain a more universal network and make more reliable predictions table 3 shows the differences in their optimal training ratios for different sewage treatment processes additionally a sensitivity analysis aimed at the a2o process was performed and the results are shown in fig 4c it can be seen clearly that cod makes a great contribution in the network and the sensitivity value equals 97 37 while total phosphorus and ammonia nitrogen have very little influence and the influence of flow and ph is quite weak this is interesting because the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen is not greatly affected by the original ammonia nitrogen but the cod in inlet water this might prove that cod is the quantity of greatest concern during water treatment 3 5 specificity analysis in the above we have established a network model for each different wastewater treatment process to explore the specificity of these models we substituted the factory data of different processes into the model and calculated its mape value according to table 4 it is obvious that when the production process and the network model are the same the network accuracy is the highest and the mape values except those of the cast process are all below 1 which verifies the unity of the network models this indicates that the model established in this work has a high specificity 3 6 industrial verification in the newly built wwtp the water quality data were measured by the local government table s2 the data from april 2021 were screened out because the inflow properties were abnormal and out of the working range of the model the measured ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency and simulated efficiency using the bpann model are shown in fig s5 the mape value of all 20 testing data points is 0 9486 this indicates that the model has a better consistency with the daily operations of wwtps 4 conclusion in this study a bpann model with high accuracy for the a2o process was developed the ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency of wwtps was successfully predicted by using five variables inlet flow rate ph value ammonia nitrogen concentration cod concentration and total phosphorus concentration in the same method we built the bpann model for four other processes 1 the a2o bpann could reach an accuracy of 0 7675 mean average percentage error 2 the cod concentration reached the highest sensitivity of 97 37 in all five variables used in the model 3 by optimizing the training data ratios the bpann for od sbr mbr and cast processes could reduce the mean average percentage error to 0 5727 1 0040 0 0669 and 0 3650 respectively 4 further calculation indicates that the bpann for each process has high specificity and 5 the industrial experiment proved that the model has good industrial applications in which the mape reached 0 9486 overall the model could be used to choose the optimum treatment process in new wwtp designs or take action in advance to avoid the risk of excessive emissions when wwtps are subjected to sudden shocks declaration of competing interest

15663,the precipitation of carbonate minerals does not invariably result in co2 emission to the atmosphere because dissolved inorganic carbon dic can be partially utilized by terrestrial aquatic phototrophs thus generating an autochthonous organic carbon aoc sink however little is known about the potential effects of this mechanism on carbon cycles in dic rich lakes mainly due to the lack of detailed documentation of the related processes which limits our ability to accurately evaluate and predict the magnitude of this carbon sink we conducted field observations in fuxian lake a large and representative karst lake in the yunnan guizhou plateau sw china continuous diel monitoring was conducted to quantitatively assess the coupled relationship between lake metabolism and dic cycling and its influence on the carbonate weathering related co2 sink we found that the diel physicochemical variations and isotopic characteristics were mainly controlled by the metabolism of aquatic phototrophs evidenced by a significant relationship between net ecosystem production and diel dic cycling and demonstrating the significance of dic fertilization in supporting high primary production in karst lakes the data showed that a reduction in photosynthesis occurred in the afternoon of almost every day which can be explained by the lower co2 o2 ratio that increased the potential for the photorespiration of aquatic plants thus reducing photosynthesis we found that a net autotrophic ecosystem prevailed in fuxian lake suggesting that the lake functions more as a sink than a source of atmospheric co2 considering carbonate weathering the estimated aoc sink amounted to 650 704 t c km 2 yr 1 demonstrating both the potentially significant role of metabolism in lacustrine carbon cycling and the potential of the combination of photosynthesis and carbonate weathering for carbon sequestration our findings may help to quantitatively estimate the future impact of lake metabolism on carbon cycling with implications for formulating management policies needed to regulate the magnitude of this carbon sink graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords carbonate weathering related carbon sink lake metabolism aquatic phototrophs diel monitoring carbon cycling net ecosystem production 1 introduction primary energy demand fell by almost 4 in 2020 and global energy related co2 emissions fell by 5 8 according to the latest statistical data from the international energy agency although this was the largest annual percentage decline since world war ii the emissions still reached a monitored 31 5 billion metric tons which far exceeds the 20 5 billion metric tons in 1990 https www iea org and the resulting global warming has been a focus of concern amongst academics and governments regnier et al 2013 beerling et al 2020 goll et al 2021 pertinent to the climate crisis in addition to artificial carbon capture and storage technology several natural physicochemical and biological processes in nature such as rock weathering and photosynthesis can also capture and store atmospheric co2 in recent years the view that the carbon fixed by the coupling of carbonate weathering and aquatic photosynthesis can represent an important global carbon sink has attracted increasing research interest liu et al 2010 2011 2017 2018 2021 2015 yang et al 2015 he et al 2019 2020 2021a chen et al 2017 2021 pu et al 2017 bao et al 2022 sun et al 2022 carbonate weathering liberates base cations and provides abundant dissolved inorganic carbon dic which is converted from atmospheric co2 zeng et al 2022 and can subsequently be utilized by aquatic photosynthesis as a carbon source during biological carbon pumping bcp in aquatic environments zhao et al 2022 the generated autochthonous organic carbon aoc is the product of the transformation of dic to organic carbon oc which plays an underestimated role in climate change on various timescales liu et al 2010 2018 2021 whether carbonate weathering can provide a significant and sustained carbon sink in which the utilization of dic by aquatic phototrophs cannot be ignored liu et al 2010 2011 2018 2021 yang et al 2015 liu et al 2015 chen et al 2017 can be investigated by determining the diel variations in lake metabolic processes and carbon cycling in lake surface waters however such studies are relatively rare clarifying the origin evolution and dynamic processes involving dic is crucial to advancing our understanding of the carbon cycling in karst aquatic ecosystems and its role in regional and global carbon budgets pu et al 2017 the dynamics of biogeochemical cycles including carbon cycles in aquatic ecosystems are related to metabolic processes involving the production or utilization of organic matter lakes with high primary productivity typically show substantial deceases in dic and increases in dissolved oxygen do during the day with the opposite trends at night in response to changes in photosynthesis and respiration by aquatic plants nimick et al 2011 these changes coupled with those of water temperature may result in diel scale variations in nutrients and other physical chemical and isotopic species previous research has emphasized specific aspects of the biochemistry of karst waters focusing mainly on the effects of aquatic metabolism on carbon cycling jiang et al 2013 yang et al 2015 liu et al 2015 chen et al 2017 he et al 2019 however much of the relevant literature is qualitative and a comprehensive and quantitative study of aquatic metabolism and its role in carbon cycling has rarely been attempted for lake ecosystems lake metabolism is a key factor for understanding the carbon and energy transfers to from and within lake ecosystems odum 1956 aho et al 2021 castro et al 2021 herrera and nadaoka 2021 observations of the production and respiration of marine plankton communities have promoted studies aimed to determine whether aquatic ecosystems act as sinks or sources of atmospheric co2 via estimating the net autotrophic or heterotrophic balance and this analytical approach was later extended to lakes e g broecker et al 1979 cole et al 1994 duarte and agusti 1998 the metabolism of aquatic ecosystems is often expressed in terms of the gross primary production gpp and ecosystem respiration r which can help evaluate the metabolic balance of ecosystems and assess their roles in autotrophic or heterotrophic systems gazeau et al 2005 hu et al 2015 gpp and r together represent the metabolic balance of aquatic ecosystems termed the net ecosystem production nep gpp r which provides information about the sources or sinks of atmospheric co2 for example when gpp r nep 0 aquatic photoautotrophs can effectively transfer dic to oc while when gpp r nep 0 the consumption of oc exceeds the production odum 1956 solomon et al 2013 castro et al 2021 it is currently assumed that lakes worldwide are usually net heterotrophic gpp r and supersaturated with co2 due to the inputs of allochthonous carbon e g cole et al 1994 2007 duarte and agusti 1998 however evidence of the net heterotrophic status of these lakes is derived using different methods and the methods used to estimate metabolism and the range of lake types studied are limited especially dissolved organic carbon doc and total phosphorus tp are important factors that have been used to draw different conclusions cole et al 2000 prairie et al 2002 hanson et al 2003 for instance contrary to previous estimates for lakes worldwide 60 of eutrophic lakes were undersaturated with respect to co2 michelle and john 2011 moreover lake metabolism is controlled by different physical chemical and biological parameters such as temperature ph wind speed solar radiation nutrients biomass and community structure duarte and agustí 1998 cole et al 2000 prairie et al 2002 hanson et al 2003 amaral et al 2018 herrera and nadaoka 2021 additionally detailed and fine scale monitoring such as of lake metabolism on the diel scale staehr et al 2012 is important for reducing the uncertainty of heterotrophic versus autotrophic assessments of lakes our focus in this study is on terrestrial carbonate rock weathering coupled with aquatic photosynthesis which is an atmospheric co2 removal mechanism given the need to better understand the variability and magnitude of this carbon sink liu et al 2018 since global changes are expected to affect the intensity of carbonate weathering water level temperature illumination and the degree of eutrophication the increased recognition of lake metabolism is needed to better understand the capacity of the carbon sink associated with carbonate weathering in terrestrial aquatic ecosystems however the current limited sampling involved in carbon budget calculations and the inherent fine scale variations of these processes make estimating the carbon sink for terrestrial aquatic ecosystem extremely challenging in this study climatic and biochemical parameters gpp r and nep were calculated using intensive diel observations quarterly and throughout a full year in the northern and southern parts of fuxian lake a large and representative karst lake in yunnan sw china using various data logging sensors and water sampling we quantitatively assess the role of lake metabolism in carbon cycling using a bookkeeping metabolism model further we compare the gpp and r to determine whether the aquatic ecosystem of fuxian lake acts as a net co2 source or sink if the ecosystem is a sink especially relating to carbonate weathering the question arises regarding the magnitude of the sink flux the answers to these questions can potentially provide insights into the role of metabolism in the evolution of the lake carbon cycle in the context of quantifying atmospheric co2 removal via the interaction between carbonate weathering and aquatic phototrophs and to better understand the terrestrial carbon sink 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description fuxian lake 24 21 24 37 n 102 49 102 57 e 1722 5 m above sea level is a large and deep lake area 212 km2 maximum depth 158 9 m mean depth 95 2 m volume 20 62 109 m3 in the yunnan guizhou plateau in yunnan province southwest china fig 1 it is the second deepest freshwater lake in china the catchment area is relatively small 675 km2 with more than 20 short streams entering the lake the lake has a wide and deep northern basin and a comparatively narrow and shallow southern basin it is a karst faulted lake with a large distribution of limestone exposure that represents 60 of the catchment area and thus its hydrochemistry is dominated by hco3 ca mg he et al 2019 it is oligotrophic with long term annual values of total phosphorus tp of 0 005 to 0 013 mg l 1 total nitrogen tn of 0 100 to 0 223 mg l 1 chlorophyll a of 0 16 to 2 34 μg l 1 1986 2015 and water transparency of 5 m zhang et al 2021 the average annual precipitation within the fuxian lake basin is 951 mm and the annual mean temperature is 15 6 c the diversity and species richness of the phytoplankton in fuxian lake are low the lake biota are mainly green algae followed by cyanobacteria diatoms and dinoflagellates li et al 2007 submerged plants in fuxian lake are mainly distributed in the shallow water area 5 1 km2 along the lake margin in depths of 0 5 14 m 4 3 m on average and accounting for 2 4 of the lake surface phytoplankton are the major primary producers in lake fuxian zhang et al 2021 there are almost no emergent and floating leaf plant communities in the lake and the dominant submerged plants are characean algae myriophyllum spicatum vallisneria natans potamogeton pectinatus and ceratophylum demersum he and li 2021 in recent years although the total biomass and spatial distribution of submerged plants have increased substantially the lake ecosystem has not exceeded a tipping point the lake has never been considered to be a eutrophic lake water quality type i li et al 2007 liu et al 2008 he and li 2021 which is also reflected by molecular sedimentary evidence over the past century zhang et al 2021 he et al 2021b 2 2 data acquisition given the importance of the diel dynamics in subtropical water bodies we intensively monitored various lake physicochemical variables during both the day and night data and samples were collected in the lake margins in the northern and southeastern parts of fuxian lake lwh and jl respectively fig 1 at the depth of 50 cm continuous measurements over 24 49 h were made of meteorological and physicochemical variables to understand the diel dynamics of fuxian lake in winter january 17 18 spring april 21 23 summer july 27 29 and autumn october 29 31 under stable meteorological conditions without precipitation events during 2017 two hand held water quality meters ponsel oden france were programmed to measure temperature t ph electrical conductivity ec 25 c and dissolved oxygen do at 15 min intervals spanning a complete diurnal cycle the meters were calibrated prior to deployment using ph 4 7 and 10 ec 1413 μs cm 1 and do 0 100 standards the resolutions of the measurements of t ph ec and do are 0 01 c 0 01 0 1 μs cm 1 and 0 01 mg l 1 respectively an on site meteorological station provided observations of atmospheric temperature relative humidity evaporation capacity precipitation wind velocity and direction and solar radiation at 60 min intervals water samples were collected every two hours during the day and every four hours at night two sets of water samples for measuring major cations ca2 mg2 k and na and anions cl so4 2 and no3 were filtered in the field using 0 45 µm millipore nitrocellulose filters and 20 ml of these samples were stored in acid washed hdpe bottles cation samples were acidified to ph 2 using concentrated ultrapure hno3 and no preservatives were added to the samples collected for major anions both cationic and anionic samples were stored in a refrigerator at 4 c major anions were analyzed using an automated dionex ics 90 ion chromatograph dionex usa and major cations were analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes usa procedural blanks and reagent were measured in parallel with the samples the detection limit of these ions was 0 01 mg l 1 additionally dic concentrations were titrated in situ using an aquamerck alkalinity test kit merck germany with an estimated accuracy of 0 05 mmol l 1 the ph values of the water column ranged from 7 9 to 9 3 and thus the dic in the water column is dominated by hco3 which accounts for over 95 of the total hco3 dissolved co2 co2aq and co3 2 therefore we used hco3 as an approximation for dic based on the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 as well as the titration of hco3 regression analysis of the concentrations of these ions and ec was used to estimate the concentrations of ca2 and hco3 which were used for further calculations yang et al 2015 liu et al 2015 the remaining water samples 60 ml for δ13cdic measurements were filtered by pressure filtration through 0 45 µm cellulose acetate filters and collected in acid washed hdpe bottles with air tight caps with no air bubbles or headspace one drop of saturated hgcl2 was added to prevent microbial activity and all samples were stored in a refrigerator at 4 c δ13cdic values were analyzed using an mat 253 mass spectrometer with analytical precision typically better than 0 03 based on replicate measurements of an internal laboratory standard the results are expressed as δ13cdic with respect to the international vienna peedee belemnite vpdb standard all the laboratory analyses were carried out at the state key laboratory of environmental geochemistry chinese academy of sciences the co2 partial pressure pco2 and calcite saturation index sic are important indicators for karst water chemistry research however both are difficult to determine directly using instrumentation and they need to be estimated from model calculations pco2 and sic in water were calculated using the hydrogeochemical simulation software phreeqc interactive version 3 3 8 database phreeqc dat which was developed by the united states geological survey usgs https www usgs gov software phreeqc version 3 the hydrochemical datasets including t ph and the concentrations of k na ca2 mg2 hco3 cl so42 and no3 were used as inputs assuming the pco2 in the water body reaches exchange equilibrium with the collected water samples pco2 can be calculated as 1 p c o 2 hco 3 h k 1 k c o 2 where the species in parentheses refer to the activities of the corresponding species in mol l 1 and k 1 and k c o 2 represent the first dissociation constants for co2 gas in water and the temperature dependent henry s law respectively sic in a water body is calculated as 2 s i c lg c a 2 co 3 2 k c where the species in parentheses is the ion activity product and k c represents the temperature dependent equilibrium constant of calcite dissolution when sic 0 the water is supersaturated with respect to calcite when sic 0 the dissolution of calcite in the solution is in equilibrium and when sic 0 the water is undersaturated with respect to calcite 2 3 lake metabolism on the diel scale the methods used to measure the metabolism of aquatic ecosystems are increasingly diverse and have specific limitations and advantages according to the methods and guidelines discussed by winslow et al 2016 continuous diel o2 measurements are widely used to investigate lake metabolism odum 1956 cole et al 2000 demars et al 2015 hu et al 2015 winslow et al 2016 tonetta et al 2016 martinsen et al 2017 andersen et al 2019 herrera and nadaoka 2021 the change in do in each time interval is caused by two processes net ecosystem production and diffusion exchange with the atmosphere the following do mass balance model was used to estimate the metabolic components of lakes which is expressed as a bookkeeping model winslow et al 2016 3 δ do ne p t 1 δ t f t 1 here δdo is the change in the do concentration over time as o2 in mg l 1 t 1 and nep mg l 1 δt 1 is

of the diel cycles of the measured and calculated physicochemical parameters are summarized in table 1 all four sampling surveys at sites lwh and jl were conducted under conditions of no rainfall the duration of daylight changed from 10 44 12 54 13 22 and 11 16 h d 1 in january april july and october respectively table 2 the persistent cloudy conditions in april resulted in the lowest total daily insolation 2543 w m 2 d 1 during the four sampling periods compared to january 5317 w m 2 d 1 and july 7251 w m 2 d 1 and october 5249 w m 2 d 1 during the sampling period the wind speed was low and its amplitude of variation was small with the mean value decreasing from january 1 83 m s 1 to october 1 13 m s 1 table 2 the charge balances characterized by the normalized inorganic charge balance nicb 100 tz tz tz where tz k na 2ca2 2mg2 and tz hco3 cl no3 2so4 2 in μeq 10 6 charge equivalent units per liter is generally within 5 which is acceptable li et al 2011 in this study samples showed an nicb of 3 4 median and 2 4 mean indicating that the contribution of organic acids and ligands to the charge balance was not significant the diel cycles of t ph do and sic were almost in phase and showed increasing trends during the day and decreasing trends at night in contrast ec ca2 hco3 and pco2 decreased during the day and began to increase at night figs 2 and 3 the water temperature ranged from 14 7 c to 26 8 c with the highest values during the afternoon 13 00 16 00 and the lowest at around sunrise 5 00 7 00 as for t the lowest mean values of ph sic and do were in january and the largest amplitudes in the diel cycling of these parameters were in july the coefficients of variation cv of pco2 in jl and lwh were 0 2 0 7 and 0 2 0 6 respectively and the cv values of do were 0 1 0 3 and 0 2 0 3 respectively table 2 the changes in the hydrochemistry at the two sites in different seasons were highly consistent similar values and trends of physicochemical changes were also found at different water depths of the water column he et al 2019 which indicates that the lake water was well mixed during the diel monitoring period in january and april of 2017 the δ13cdic values were high during the day and low at night but they showed a completely different trend in july and october low values during the day and high values at night fig 4 the magnitude of the diel variability of δ13cdic at the two sites increased synchronously from january jl 1 22 lwh 1 50 to april jl 0 23 lwh 0 07 to july jl 0 26 lwh 1 30 following the same seasonal trend as the day length and water temperature 3 2 ecosystem metabolism from january to july 2017 the variations of gpp 19 57 g o2 m 2 d 1 and r 9 54 g o2 m 2 d 1 were of a similar magnitude and varied approximately in parallel increasing approximately twofold at both sites table 3 this likely reflects the increases in insolation t and biomass or the composition of aquatic organism assemblages one reason for this is that aquatic plants are dominant in shallow lakes and experience high metabolic rates during july the rates of gpp and r were higher at lwh than at jl but they were closely correlated over time which may indicate a common response to nutrient inputs as well as a well mixed water body compared to other deeper and larger lakes hanson et al 2003 solomon et al 2013 the rates of gpp and r in fuxian lake were relatively high and gave rise to substantial diel fluctuations in the rates of lake metabolism the balance between gpp and r nep at the two sites was predominantly positive during the day and negative at night in different seasons except for one day in october at jl 3 73 g o2 m 2 d 1 and for one day in april at lwh 6 76 g o2 m 2 d 1 at fuxian lake solar radiation could contribute to the diel cycle of heat content and be responsible for the changes in nep in different seasons however the nep in january was likely controlled mainly by the combined effects of solar radiation and wind the wind speed exceeded 6 m s 1 on the morning of january 18th intensifying the vertical heat transfer nep also showed diel variations with positive correlations with carbon cycling including hco3 pco2 sic and δ13cdic figs 5 and 6 which indicates that the nep and carbon cycling were linked and controlled by common mechanisms 4 discussion 4 1 origin of the diel variations in physicochemical and isotopic characteristics in our previous study of the seasonal variation of physical and chemical variables within different depth profiles from the northern central and southern parts of fuxian lake throughout 2017 we concluded that these variations were controlled mainly by the metabolism of aquatic phototrophs he et al 2019 however lake metabolism is poorly quantified and little is known about it on the diel timescale streamflow and groundwater inputs water temperature gaseous exchange carbonate precipitation and dissolution and biological processes could be the main mechanisms responsible for the diel physicochemical characteristics of lake surface waters jiang et al 2013 de montety et al 2011 nimick et al 2011 liu et al 2015 yang et al 2015 chen et al 2017 pu et al 2017 siebers et al 2020 herrera and nadaoka 2021 the effects of streamflow and groundwater inputs are considered to have negligible effects on the diel variability at sites lwh and jl due to the small lake catchment area and strong buffering capacity of fuxian lake he et al 2019 according to previous monitoring data little or no seasonal variations were observed in the physicochemical parameters of the groundwater which show a steady trend for instance do ranged from 5 7 to 6 5 6 2 on average and was low and stable in different seasons he et al 2019 and significantly lower than the lake water jl especially which is distant from major fluvial inputs has the same diel characteristics as lwh thus external inputs were not the main driver of the physicochemical variations as noted in a comprehensive summary nimick et al 2011 the water temperature may show more consistent diurnal variability than other physicochemical properties temperature changes can affect the ph on the diel scale either by changing the gaseous exchange rate between the water and atmosphere or by changing the solubility of calcite de montety et al 2011 liu et al 2015 it is noteworthy that less than 1 and 6 of the diel variations in ph and pco2 respectively can be explained by water temperature changes based on the hydrogeochemical simulation software phreeqc additionally although the changes in pco2 in the fuxian lake followed the temperature solubility rule the opposite trend in do was observed fig 7 this indicates that temperature was not the major control on the variations in ph pco2 and do on the diel timescale additionally the influence of temperature on gaseous exchange is difficult to separate from that of biological processes which are substantially driven by changes in solar radiation clearly both mechanisms need to be considered together gaseous exchange between air and water can induce variations in pco2 and do nimick et al 2011 although it has been shown that inland lakes tend to be co2 supersaturated with respect to the atmosphere cole et al 1994 khan et al 2020 the pco2 in fuxian lake was generally lower than that of the atmosphere during the day figs 2 and 3 additionally due to other processes such as respiration by aquatic plants co2 outgassing at night was not expected to have driven calcite precipitation indeed sic reached a minimum but remained positive and to have enriched the δ13cdic indeed a minimum value was attained of the residual dic fig 4 similarly the results show relatively low and highly consistent k values of 2 7 4 2 cm h 1 for the o2 diffusion coefficient across the air water interface in different seasons also as shown in fig 7 pco2 and do were strongly negatively correlated suggesting that degassing was not the major factor controlling pco2 and do as well as δ13cdic on the diel timescale during the day photosynthesis removes co2 i e causing the depletion of 12c in the remaining dic which thus increases the ph of the lake water and reduces the solubility of calcite which may drive calcite precipitation liu et al 2015 in most waters biological activity controls the co2 concentration which then influences the carbonate saturation de montety et al 2011 in fuxian lake sic generally increased to 1 during the day and ca2 decreased linearly with hco3 figs 2 and 3 which suggests the potential for calcite precipitation to occur conversely respiration at night increased the co2 concentration i e releasing 12co2 into the water decreased the ph and thus promoted calcite dissolution however no carbonate dissolution occurred in fuxian lake during the monitoring period because sic was always positive indicating oversaturation with respect to calcite figs 2 and 3 and the absence of carbonate dissolution at night therefore carbonate dissolution is unlikely to have driven the changes in hydrochemistry and δ13cdic several studies have shown that diel variations of pco2 and do are induced by the photosynthesis and respiration of aquatic plants e g nimick et al 2011 liu et al 2015 yang et al 2015 chen et al 2017 he et al 2019 pco2 and do follow opposite trends in fuxian lake fig 7 coinciding with the metabolic processes operating in aquatic ecosystems the diel variations of nutrients and do induced by biological activity have also received attention e g odum 1956 de montety et al 2011 during photosynthesis the no3 concentration decreases and the do concentration increases in response to the solar radiation level these characteristics can be observed in fuxian lake for example no3 was positively correlated with co2 r2 0 29 and negatively correlated with do r2 0 26 at lwh in april additionally when photosynthesis occurs during the day 12co2 absorption by aquatic organisms occurs more rapidly than that of 13co2 generally resulting in enriched δ13cdic values which were observed in january and april 2017 fig 4 in july and october however the opposite trend occurred fig 4 which may be related to the strong degradation of organic matter producing 13c depleted dic caused by the intensification of microbial activity parker et al 2010 and or the influx of atmospheric co2 and its kinetic fractionation the isotope fractionation value can reach 13 herczeg and fairbanks 1987 which is clearly shown by the observation that the pco2 in july and october was lower than in april and january and even lower than the atmospheric pco2 figs 2 and 3 in general more positive δ13cdic values in the surface water occurred in july and october when most of the photosynthesis occurs overall these observations emphasize the significant influence of biological metabolism on the hydrochemistry of fuxian lake 4 2 lake metabolism and its influence on carbon dynamics the foregoing results confirm the existence of a diel cycle of aquatic metabolism including aquatic photosynthesis and respiration and its influence on the hydrochemistry and c isotopes of fuxian lake as previously reported in both freshwater jiang et al 2013 liu et al 2015 yang et al 2015 chen et al 2017 pu et al 2017 siebers et al 2020 and marine ecosystems teichert coddington and green 1993 the variations in these processes determine the fate of the carbon cycle in aquatic systems nimick et al 2011 staehr et al 2012 quantifying the rates of the production and degradation of aquatic plants and other organic matter is of fundamental importance for understanding the cycling of carbon and for estimating the status and maintaining the health of aquatic ecosystems castro et al 2021 recent investigations of metabolism via nep in arctic subarctic temperate and tropical ecosystems have led to a better understanding of the contributions of aquatic ecosystems to carbon budgets both regionally and globally bates and mathis 2009 martinsen et al 2017 amaral et al 2018 andersen et al 2019 siebers et al 2020 herrera and nadaoka 2021 our study of the littoral zone of fuxian lake which has dense stands of submerged macrophytes has documented the temporal and spatial changes of metabolic rates and carbon species and we observed high rates and the close diel coupling of nep and carbon species figs 5 and 6 although respiration always occurs and may even be higher during the day than at night the gross primary production in fuxian lake exceeded the respiration gpp r positive nep and aquatic plants consumed dic co2aq hco3 and released o2 causing increases in ph sic and δ13cdic fig 8 photosynthesis ceased at night and respiration was dominant gpp r negative nep and aquatic plants consumed do and released dic thereby reducing the ph sic and δ13cdic fig 8 these observations indicate that the diel variations of the carbon cycle were largely controlled by the nep the nep was poorly correlated with wind speed on most occasions while it was more strongly correlated with solar radiation and water temperature which appears to be the main mechanism driving the changes in nep especially in july summer the nep reached a maximum under the high level of solar radiation and high water temperatures figs 5 and 6 although high temperatures could intensify photorespiration and mitochondrial respiration even further kragh et al 2017 as well as post depositional mineralization rates gudasz et al 2010 the increased primary productivity under the coupled effects of solar radiation and water temperature exceeded the effect of the increased respiration caused by temperature this finding is consistent with observations in lake geneva castro et al 2021 capitol lake yang et al 2019 la salada lake and sauce grande lake alfonso et al 2018 where solar radiation and water temperature were significantly positively correlated with the nep however it contrasts with the case of laguna lake in the philippines herrera and nadaoka 2021 which may be due to the absence of stable water column stratification in the rainy season indeed multiple factors are likely responsible for the difference as suggested by herrera and nadaoka 2021 for example the biomass and physiological state of aquatic plants are not only affected by the water temperature wind speed and solar radiation but also by the availability of inorganic nutrients the structure of the food web and the mixing regime theoretically the nep is higher in the growing season which is also the case at fuxian lake because of the strong solar radiation in summer and the flourishing of aquatic plants our paired do pco2 measurements support this viewpoint i e do reached a maximum of 16 31 mg l 1 and pco2 reached a minimum of 5 31 pa during the monitoring period fig 7 additionally during the summer productivity peak in shallow water when co2aq depletion occurred except for the influence of possible atmospheric co2 invasion with corresponding depleted δ13cdic values herczeg and fairbanks 1987 the hco3 likely supports these high levels of gpp and nep additionally we found that in the afternoon of different seasons pco2 and hco3 varied synchronously as did do figs 5 and 6 the dic store in the form of hco3 has developed two mechanisms to support gpp 1 chemical exchange with co2 via hydration and ionization reactions and 2 the co2 concentrating mechanism in submerged plants and algae aho et al 2021 this may be why the gpp r ratio in fuxian lake is higher than that of other lakes fig 9 which likely indicates that karst lakes with high dic support high primary production positive nep values were concentrated in the interval from sunrise to shortly after noon while they were close to zero in the late afternoon and strongly negative at night in all seasons from morning to afternoon solar radiation t do and ph increased substantially corresponding to decreased dic co2aq hco3 which is likely the cause of the decrease in nep at this time figs 5 and 6 this is supported by in situ experiments which showed that in water rich in dic and with a hypoxic state the photosynthesis of charophyte shoots cultured in surface water lacking dic and dissolved oxygen was significantly reduced kragh et al 2017 the littoral zone in fuxian lake is dominated by submerged plants which may have evolved co2 concentrating mechanisms ccms that enable cells to increase the co2 concentration in cellular microcompartments to levels at which the carbon fixing enzyme rubisco can operate efficiently dülger et al 2017 due to the competitive interaction of the carboxylase and oxygenase activity of rubisco the co2 o2 quotient at the site of activity is the result of the balance between photosynthetic co2 utilization and photorespiratory co2 depletion sand jensen and frost christensen 1998 therefore a lower dic and higher oxygen concentration lower dic do and or co2aq do could limit photosynthesis in the late afternoon in fuxian lake figs s1 s4 the low co2 o2 ratio could also increase the photorespiration rate of aquatic plants although the determination of the threshold needs further research 4 3 fuxian lake as a net autotrophic ecosystem and its role as a metabolic sink for c understanding the balance of these metabolic processes is important because it defines the role of aquatic ecosystems in the global carbon cycle that is whether they are a source or sink of atmospheric carbon duarte and agustí 1998 in this study we compared the gpp and r of aquatic communities to determine whether fuxian lake hence potentially other lakes also was a carbon source gpp r nep 0 or sink gpp r nep 0 fig 9 shows that r is associated with the ecosystem gpp and the slope of the power equation is close to 1 r2 0 74 p 0 0001 n 14 which falls mainly within the field of lake aquatic ecosystems compiled by hoellein et al 2013 the nep values in fuxian lake in july summer ranged from 3 0 to 12 9 g o2 m 2 d 1 with the mean value of 7 7 g o2 m 2 d 1 25 globally distributed lakes had a mean summer nep value ranging from 7 3 to 9 9 g o2 m 2 d 1 as compiled by solomon et al 2013 due to the small catchment area and long water retention time 167 years of fuxian lake the spatial heterogeneity of metabolism was low figs 5 6 and 9 indicating that the surface layer is well mixed horizontally positive nep values across the four seasons for the two monitoring sites 6 6 g o2 m 2 d 1 on average indicate that the lake ecosystem was net autotrophic and acted as a co2 sink to assess the potential atmospheric fluxes of c produced by lake metabolism in fuxian lake gpp r and nep need to be converted to carbon units g c m 2 a 1 during photosynthesis aquatic primary productivity consumes co2 and produces o2 in the molar ratio o2 co2 of 1 2 lefèvre and merlivat 2012 aho et al 2021 in contrast the molar ratio of co2 o2 for respiration with o2 is 106 138 steinsberger et al 2021 at the two monitoring sites in fuxian lake the co2 sink flux by aquatic plants had the ranges of 0 7 345 7 g c m 2 d 1 at jl and 85 0 515 5 g c m 2 d 1 at lwh obtained by calculation with the corresponding fluxes of 902 t c km 2 yr 1 and 833 t c km 2 yr 1 respectively demonstrating an important potential co2 sink the metabolic organic carbon sink produced by the biological carbon pump bcp promotes the conversion from dic to oc and the magnitudes 833 902 t c km 2 yr 1 in fuxian lake a karst lake are similar to our previous result estimated by ion dic ca2 mass balance at the epikarst aquatic photosynthesis rate 285 852 t c km 2 yr 1 liu et al 2015 yang et al 2015 and is slightly higher than the shawan karst test site 156 493 t c km 2 yr 1 chen et al 2017 these rates are 25 81 times higher than that of the oceanic biological pump devries and weber 2017 additionally we found that at fuxian lake 78 of inorganic carbon sources are photosynthetically fixed by aquatic plants in the form of hco3 based on a carbon isotope model he and li 2021 from which the carbon sink flux can be seen to reach 650 704 t c km 2 yr 1 these findings demonstrate the great potential of the combination of terrestrial aquatic photosynthesis and carbonate weathering for c sequestration therefore atmospheric co2 uptake by the coupling of carbonate weathering with the aquatic photosynthesis mechanism should be considered within the regional and global carbon cycle and in climate models 4 4 the role of karst lakes in the regional and global carbon cycle eutrophic aquatic ecosystems are generally regarded as a net co2 sink due to the high allochthonous inputs of inorganic nutrients e g n p that could drive the conversion rate of dic to oc michelle and john 2011 whereas oligotrophic aquatic ecosystems act as a net co2 source and their primary productivity is controlled by cycling processes driven by heterotrophic organisms duarte and agustí 1998 on this basis oligotrophic fuxian lake should be a heterotrophic lake although the metabolism monitoring in this study was not conducted in the center of the lake net autotrophy is anticipated for fuxian lake considering the low organic supply from its small watershed and the deep water environment together with the fact that autochthonous organic carbon deposition occupies a dominant position chen et al 2018 he et al 2019 2020 the nep evaluation supports the notion that the shallow water areas of large deep water lakes are important components of global carbon processing which is often overlooked at the same time the increasing eutrophication of such lakes will induce more autochthonous deposition and hence co2 emissions to the atmosphere are expected to decrease liu et al 2021 ran et al 2021 the dic mainly hco3 utilization by aquatic plants especially submerged plants dülger et al 2017 is higher in karst lakes than in non karst lakes liu et al 2018 liu et al 2017 confirmed the conversion of dic to autochthonous organic carbon aoc through 14c analysis in the pearl river basin later at the karst test site chen et al 2017 bao et al 2022 and in the yangtze river and yellow river liu et al 2021 zhao et al 2022 the so called dic fertilization effect was identified in which more aoc and phytoplankton biomass was produced with higher concentrations of dic additionally several studies identified a priming effect on the breakdown of both aquatic plants and terrestrially derived c ward et al 2016 which means that o2 can be consumed by primary production and allochthonous organic matter in an aerobic environment thus a substantial part of the co2 emissions results from the degradation of allochthonous organic matter further our research on karst aquatic ecosystems showed that chemoheterotrophy was significantly reduced in high dic and ca2 environments and that chemoheterotrophic planktonic bacteria were fewer based on the dominant functional gene predicted by functional annotation of the prokaryotic taxa xia et al 2022 therefore it is important to determine whether the influence of lake metabolism on the carbon cycle is specific to karst aquatic ecosystems differences in the carbon budgets of karst lakes and non karst lakes were also observed in several previous studies finlay et al 2009 tranvik et al 2009 karst lakes in the northern great plains showed a net influx of co2 and efficient sediment storage finlay et al 2009 relative to the non karst lakes in the boreal catchment sobek et al 2006 this difference could be explained by the simplified conceptual model shown in fig 10 hard water lakes characterized by high ph and dic but lower co2 concentrations have been confirmed by statistical research on the global scale duarte et al 2008 coupled with the efficient utilization of dic by aquatic plants may further deplete dissolved co2 additionally aoc is resistant to microbial remineralization in high dic and ca2 environments xia et al 2022 which may also reduce co2 emissions and aoc storage thus high aoc sedimentary storage and precipitated caco3 were both observed in karst lakes in the northern great plains finlay et al 2009 which may confirm the occurrence of a strong bcp effect liu et al 2018 he et al 2020 finally it is worth noting that the northern hardwater lakes shifted progressively from being substantial co2 sources in the mid 1990s to sequestering co2 by 2010 with increasing atmospheric warming and ph finlay et al 2015 this decrease in co2 efflux may be due mainly to increasing aquatic photosynthesis liu et al 2021 additionally hco3 showed a steady trend of increase of 2 1 2 6 from 1950 to 2100 under a future climate and land use scenario zeng et al 2019 in the context of global climate change and lake eutrophication a large amount of autochthonous production should therefore likely suffice to drive aquatic ecosystems especially the biota of karst aquatic ecosystems towards net autotrophy acting as a co2 sink we recognize that such simple up scaling has its limitations and we also note that small continental waters should not be ignored in virtually all global processes and cycles downing 2010 williams et al 2013 holgerson 2015 holgerson and raymond 2016 marcé et al 2019 in which the processes and mechanisms of the carbon cycle especially the impact of the differential contributions of autochthonous and allochthonous source need to be clarified therefore further research is needed to evaluate the importance of dic rich lakes in the magnitude and direction of c fluxes in the global c cycle 5 conclusions diel observations are crucial for understanding the biogeochemical cycling that governs subtropical lake aquatic ecosystems the efficiency of the utilization by aquatic phototrophs of the dissolved inorganic carbon produced by carbonate weathering is an important factor in determining the magnitude of the carbon sink which can be estimated from diel observation of the hydrochemical and metabolism characteristics of surface waters our monitoring of the diel variations of the hydrochemistry of fuxian lake revealed that it was controlled principally by the photosynthesis and respiration of aquatic communities which is confirmed by quantitative metabolic parameters the impact of lake metabolism on the lake carbon dynamics also reveals the importance of the biological carbon pump in supporting the high primary production in karst lakes an additional discovery is that positive nep values were concentrated during the interval from sunrise to shortly after noon while they were close to zero in the late afternoon in all seasons which can be explained by the effects of the lower co2 o2 ratio in limiting photosynthesis and increasing the potential for the photorespiration of aquatic plants fuxian lake was found to be predominantly a net autotrophic ecosystem gpp r 1 nep 0 i e primary production exceeds respiration suggesting that the lake functions more as a sink than a source of atmospheric carbon the estimated organic carbon sink produced by the metabolism of aquatic plants in fuxian lake reached 833 902 t c km 2 yr 1 or around one order of magnitude higher than the oceanic biological pump combined with carbonate weathering the carbon sink flux will reach 650 704 t c km 2 yr 1 indicating the crucial role of lacustrine aquatic photosynthesis in sequestering the carbon caused by the coupling of carbonate weathering with aquatic photosynthesis our findings demonstrate the importance of continuous monitoring on the diel scale in highly dynamic lake ecosystems additionally they emphasize that the shallow water environment of deep water lakes is an important component of global carbon processing that cannot be ignored and that the inputs of large amounts of autochthonous organic carbon in karst aquatic systems have the ability to drive aquatic ecosystems towards net autotrophy and act as a co2 sink accordingly future studies should incorporate better estimates of lake metabolism and their influence on carbon cycling to more fully evaluate the role of lakes especially karst lakes in regional and global carbon budgets declaration of competing interest the authors

15663,the precipitation of carbonate minerals does not invariably result in co2 emission to the atmosphere because dissolved inorganic carbon dic can be partially utilized by terrestrial aquatic phototrophs thus generating an autochthonous organic carbon aoc sink however little is known about the potential effects of this mechanism on carbon cycles in dic rich lakes mainly due to the lack of detailed documentation of the related processes which limits our ability to accurately evaluate and predict the magnitude of this carbon sink we conducted field observations in fuxian lake a large and representative karst lake in the yunnan guizhou plateau sw china continuous diel monitoring was conducted to quantitatively assess the coupled relationship between lake metabolism and dic cycling and its influence on the carbonate weathering related co2 sink we found that the diel physicochemical variations and isotopic characteristics were mainly controlled by the metabolism of aquatic phototrophs evidenced by a significant relationship between net ecosystem production and diel dic cycling and demonstrating the significance of dic fertilization in supporting high primary production in karst lakes the data showed that a reduction in photosynthesis occurred in the afternoon of almost every day which can be explained by the lower co2 o2 ratio that increased the potential for the photorespiration of aquatic plants thus reducing photosynthesis we found that a net autotrophic ecosystem prevailed in fuxian lake suggesting that the lake functions more as a sink than a source of atmospheric co2 considering carbonate weathering the estimated aoc sink amounted to 650 704 t c km 2 yr 1 demonstrating both the potentially significant role of metabolism in lacustrine carbon cycling and the potential of the combination of photosynthesis and carbonate weathering for carbon sequestration our findings may help to quantitatively estimate the future impact of lake metabolism on carbon cycling with implications for formulating management policies needed to regulate the magnitude of this carbon sink graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords carbonate weathering related carbon sink lake metabolism aquatic phototrophs diel monitoring carbon cycling net ecosystem production 1 introduction primary energy demand fell by almost 4 in 2020 and global energy related co2 emissions fell by 5 8 according to the latest statistical data from the international energy agency although this was the largest annual percentage decline since world war ii the emissions still reached a monitored 31 5 billion metric tons which far exceeds the 20 5 billion metric tons in 1990 https www iea org and the resulting global warming has been a focus of concern amongst academics and governments regnier et al 2013 beerling et al 2020 goll et al 2021 pertinent to the climate crisis in addition to artificial carbon capture and storage technology several natural physicochemical and biological processes in nature such as rock weathering and photosynthesis can also capture and store atmospheric co2 in recent years the view that the carbon fixed by the coupling of carbonate weathering and aquatic photosynthesis can represent an important global carbon sink has attracted increasing research interest liu et al 2010 2011 2017 2018 2021 2015 yang et al 2015 he et al 2019 2020 2021a chen et al 2017 2021 pu et al 2017 bao et al 2022 sun et al 2022 carbonate weathering liberates base cations and provides abundant dissolved inorganic carbon dic which is converted from atmospheric co2 zeng et al 2022 and can subsequently be utilized by aquatic photosynthesis as a carbon source during biological carbon pumping bcp in aquatic environments zhao et al 2022 the generated autochthonous organic carbon aoc is the product of the transformation of dic to organic carbon oc which plays an underestimated role in climate change on various timescales liu et al 2010 2018 2021 whether carbonate weathering can provide a significant and sustained carbon sink in which the utilization of dic by aquatic phototrophs cannot be ignored liu et al 2010 2011 2018 2021 yang et al 2015 liu et al 2015 chen et al 2017 can be investigated by determining the diel variations in lake metabolic processes and carbon cycling in lake surface waters however such studies are relatively rare clarifying the origin evolution and dynamic processes involving dic is crucial to advancing our understanding of the carbon cycling in karst aquatic ecosystems and its role in regional and global carbon budgets pu et al 2017 the dynamics of biogeochemical cycles including carbon cycles in aquatic ecosystems are related to metabolic processes involving the production or utilization of organic matter lakes with high primary productivity typically show substantial deceases in dic and increases in dissolved oxygen do during the day with the opposite trends at night in response to changes in photosynthesis and respiration by aquatic plants nimick et al 2011 these changes coupled with those of water temperature may result in diel scale variations in nutrients and other physical chemical and isotopic species previous research has emphasized specific aspects of the biochemistry of karst waters focusing mainly on the effects of aquatic metabolism on carbon cycling jiang et al 2013 yang et al 2015 liu et al 2015 chen et al 2017 he et al 2019 however much of the relevant literature is qualitative and a comprehensive and quantitative study of aquatic metabolism and its role in carbon cycling has rarely been attempted for lake ecosystems lake metabolism is a key factor for understanding the carbon and energy transfers to from and within lake ecosystems odum 1956 aho et al 2021 castro et al 2021 herrera and nadaoka 2021 observations of the production and respiration of marine plankton communities have promoted studies aimed to determine whether aquatic ecosystems act as sinks or sources of atmospheric co2 via estimating the net autotrophic or heterotrophic balance and this analytical approach was later extended to lakes e g broecker et al 1979 cole et al 1994 duarte and agusti 1998 the metabolism of aquatic ecosystems is often expressed in terms of the gross primary production gpp and ecosystem respiration r which can help evaluate the metabolic balance of ecosystems and assess their roles in autotrophic or heterotrophic systems gazeau et al 2005 hu et al 2015 gpp and r together represent the metabolic balance of aquatic ecosystems termed the net ecosystem production nep gpp r which provides information about the sources or sinks of atmospheric co2 for example when gpp r nep 0 aquatic photoautotrophs can effectively transfer dic to oc while when gpp r nep 0 the consumption of oc exceeds the production odum 1956 solomon et al 2013 castro et al 2021 it is currently assumed that lakes worldwide are usually net heterotrophic gpp r and supersaturated with co2 due to the inputs of allochthonous carbon e g cole et al 1994 2007 duarte and agusti 1998 however evidence of the net heterotrophic status of these lakes is derived using different methods and the methods used to estimate metabolism and the range of lake types studied are limited especially dissolved organic carbon doc and total phosphorus tp are important factors that have been used to draw different conclusions cole et al 2000 prairie et al 2002 hanson et al 2003 for instance contrary to previous estimates for lakes worldwide 60 of eutrophic lakes were undersaturated with respect to co2 michelle and john 2011 moreover lake metabolism is controlled by different physical chemical and biological parameters such as temperature ph wind speed solar radiation nutrients biomass and community structure duarte and agustí 1998 cole et al 2000 prairie et al 2002 hanson et al 2003 amaral et al 2018 herrera and nadaoka 2021 additionally detailed and fine scale monitoring such as of lake metabolism on the diel scale staehr et al 2012 is important for reducing the uncertainty of heterotrophic versus autotrophic assessments of lakes our focus in this study is on terrestrial carbonate rock weathering coupled with aquatic photosynthesis which is an atmospheric co2 removal mechanism given the need to better understand the variability and magnitude of this carbon sink liu et al 2018 since global changes are expected to affect the intensity of carbonate weathering water level temperature illumination and the degree of eutrophication the increased recognition of lake metabolism is needed to better understand the capacity of the carbon sink associated with carbonate weathering in terrestrial aquatic ecosystems however the current limited sampling involved in carbon budget calculations and the inherent fine scale variations of these processes make estimating the carbon sink for terrestrial aquatic ecosystem extremely challenging in this study climatic and biochemical parameters gpp r and nep were calculated using intensive diel observations quarterly and throughout a full year in the northern and southern parts of fuxian lake a large and representative karst lake in yunnan sw china using various data logging sensors and water sampling we quantitatively assess the role of lake metabolism in carbon cycling using a bookkeeping metabolism model further we compare the gpp and r to determine whether the aquatic ecosystem of fuxian lake acts as a net co2 source or sink if the ecosystem is a sink especially relating to carbonate weathering the question arises regarding the magnitude of the sink flux the answers to these questions can potentially provide insights into the role of metabolism in the evolution of the lake carbon cycle in the context of quantifying atmospheric co2 removal via the interaction between carbonate weathering and aquatic phototrophs and to better understand the terrestrial carbon sink 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description fuxian lake 24 21 24 37 n 102 49 102 57 e 1722 5 m above sea level is a large and deep lake area 212 km2 maximum depth 158 9 m mean depth 95 2 m volume 20 62 109 m3 in the yunnan guizhou plateau in yunnan province southwest china fig 1 it is the second deepest freshwater lake in china the catchment area is relatively small 675 km2 with more than 20 short streams entering the lake the lake has a wide and deep northern basin and a comparatively narrow and shallow southern basin it is a karst faulted lake with a large distribution of limestone exposure that represents 60 of the catchment area and thus its hydrochemistry is dominated by hco3 ca mg he et al 2019 it is oligotrophic with long term annual values of total phosphorus tp of 0 005 to 0 013 mg l 1 total nitrogen tn of 0 100 to 0 223 mg l 1 chlorophyll a of 0 16 to 2 34 μg l 1 1986 2015 and water transparency of 5 m zhang et al 2021 the average annual precipitation within the fuxian lake basin is 951 mm and the annual mean temperature is 15 6 c the diversity and species richness of the phytoplankton in fuxian lake are low the lake biota are mainly green algae followed by cyanobacteria diatoms and dinoflagellates li et al 2007 submerged plants in fuxian lake are mainly distributed in the shallow water area 5 1 km2 along the lake margin in depths of 0 5 14 m 4 3 m on average and accounting for 2 4 of the lake surface phytoplankton are the major primary producers in lake fuxian zhang et al 2021 there are almost no emergent and floating leaf plant communities in the lake and the dominant submerged plants are characean algae myriophyllum spicatum vallisneria natans potamogeton pectinatus and ceratophylum demersum he and li 2021 in recent years although the total biomass and spatial distribution of submerged plants have increased substantially the lake ecosystem has not exceeded a tipping point the lake has never been considered to be a eutrophic lake water quality type i li et al 2007 liu et al 2008 he and li 2021 which is also reflected by molecular sedimentary evidence over the past century zhang et al 2021 he et al 2021b 2 2 data acquisition given the importance of the diel dynamics in subtropical water bodies we intensively monitored various lake physicochemical variables during both the day and night data and samples were collected in the lake margins in the northern and southeastern parts of fuxian lake lwh and jl respectively fig 1 at the depth of 50 cm continuous measurements over 24 49 h were made of meteorological and physicochemical variables to understand the diel dynamics of fuxian lake in winter january 17 18 spring april 21 23 summer july 27 29 and autumn october 29 31 under stable meteorological conditions without precipitation events during 2017 two hand held water quality meters ponsel oden france were programmed to measure temperature t ph electrical conductivity ec 25 c and dissolved oxygen do at 15 min intervals spanning a complete diurnal cycle the meters were calibrated prior to deployment using ph 4 7 and 10 ec 1413 μs cm 1 and do 0 100 standards the resolutions of the measurements of t ph ec and do are 0 01 c 0 01 0 1 μs cm 1 and 0 01 mg l 1 respectively an on site meteorological station provided observations of atmospheric temperature relative humidity evaporation capacity precipitation wind velocity and direction and solar radiation at 60 min intervals water samples were collected every two hours during the day and every four hours at night two sets of water samples for measuring major cations ca2 mg2 k and na and anions cl so4 2 and no3 were filtered in the field using 0 45 µm millipore nitrocellulose filters and 20 ml of these samples were stored in acid washed hdpe bottles cation samples were acidified to ph 2 using concentrated ultrapure hno3 and no preservatives were added to the samples collected for major anions both cationic and anionic samples were stored in a refrigerator at 4 c major anions were analyzed using an automated dionex ics 90 ion chromatograph dionex usa and major cations were analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes usa procedural blanks and reagent were measured in parallel with the samples the detection limit of these ions was 0 01 mg l 1 additionally dic concentrations were titrated in situ using an aquamerck alkalinity test kit merck germany with an estimated accuracy of 0 05 mmol l 1 the ph values of the water column ranged from 7 9 to 9 3 and thus the dic in the water column is dominated by hco3 which accounts for over 95 of the total hco3 dissolved co2 co2aq and co3 2 therefore we used hco3 as an approximation for dic based on the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 as well as the titration of hco3 regression analysis of the concentrations of these ions and ec was used to estimate the concentrations of ca2 and hco3 which were used for further calculations yang et al 2015 liu et al 2015 the remaining water samples 60 ml for δ13cdic measurements were filtered by pressure filtration through 0 45 µm cellulose acetate filters and collected in acid washed hdpe bottles with air tight caps with no air bubbles or headspace one drop of saturated hgcl2 was added to prevent microbial activity and all samples were stored in a refrigerator at 4 c δ13cdic values were analyzed using an mat 253 mass spectrometer with analytical precision typically better than 0 03 based on replicate measurements of an internal laboratory standard the results are expressed as δ13cdic with respect to the international vienna peedee belemnite vpdb standard all the laboratory analyses were carried out at the state key laboratory of environmental geochemistry chinese academy of sciences the co2 partial pressure pco2 and calcite saturation index sic are important indicators for karst water chemistry research however both are difficult to determine directly using instrumentation and they need to be estimated from model calculations pco2 and sic in water were calculated using the hydrogeochemical simulation software phreeqc interactive version 3 3 8 database phreeqc dat which was developed by the united states geological survey usgs https www usgs gov software phreeqc version 3 the hydrochemical datasets including t ph and the concentrations of k na ca2 mg2 hco3 cl so42 and no3 were used as inputs assuming the pco2 in the water body reaches exchange equilibrium with the collected water samples pco2 can be calculated as 1 p c o 2 hco 3 h k 1 k c o 2 where the species in parentheses refer to the activities of the corresponding species in mol l 1 and k 1 and k c o 2 represent the first dissociation constants for co2 gas in water and the temperature dependent henry s law respectively sic in a water body is calculated as 2 s i c lg c a 2 co 3 2 k c where the species in parentheses is the ion activity product and k c represents the temperature dependent equilibrium constant of calcite dissolution when sic 0 the water is supersaturated with respect to calcite when sic 0 the dissolution of calcite in the solution is in equilibrium and when sic 0 the water is undersaturated with respect to calcite 2 3 lake metabolism on the diel scale the methods used to measure the metabolism of aquatic ecosystems are increasingly diverse and have specific limitations and advantages according to the methods and guidelines discussed by winslow et al 2016 continuous diel o2 measurements are widely used to investigate lake metabolism odum 1956 cole et al 2000 demars et al 2015 hu et al 2015 winslow et al 2016 tonetta et al 2016 martinsen et al 2017 andersen et al 2019 herrera and nadaoka 2021 the change in do in each time interval is caused by two processes net ecosystem production and diffusion exchange with the atmosphere the following do mass balance model was used to estimate the metabolic components of lakes which is expressed as a bookkeeping model winslow et al 2016 3 δ do ne p t 1 δ t f t 1 here δdo is the change in the do concentration over time as o2 in mg l 1 t 1 and nep mg l 1 δt 1 is

kelvin weiss 1970 zt is the mixed layer depth m and the coefficient kt m t 1 is the diffusive oxygen exchange of gas with the atmosphere at a given temperature kt is estimated using the schmidt coefficient sc and the gas piston velocity corresponding to a schmidt coefficient of 600 k600 tan et al 2021 5 k k 600 s c 600 n where n is equal to 2 3 for the wind speed at 10 m height u10 3 7 m s 1 and 1 2 when u10 3 7 m s 1 assuming a neutrally stable boundary layer the gas exchange coefficient k600 k for a schmidt number of 600 m t 1 was estimated as a function of u10 from the equations of cole and caraco 1998 6 k 600 2 07 0 215 u 10 1 7 7 u 10 u h 1 c d 10 0 5 f ln 10 h where uh is the wind speed at the height of h m m s 1 d 10 is the drag coefficient at the height of 10 m 1 3 10 3 and ƒ is the von karman constant 0 4 with the listed constants the following relationship is obtained tan et al 2021 8 u 10 1 22 u 1 the normalized k600 was calculated using an empirical relationship determined by the wind speed and there is good correspondence between measured and predicted values crusius and wanninkhof 2003 9 for u 10 3 7 m s 1 k 600 0 72 u 10 10 for u 10 3 7 m s 1 k 600 4 33 u

balance between gross primary production gppt and respiration rt at time t 12 ne p t gp p t r t during the dark we assumed there was no photosynthesis gppt 0 which enables us to estimate the average rate of o2 respiration rμ mg l 1 δt 1 from the discrete rates of nept for all observations during the day sunrise to sunset winslow et al 2016 13 r μ i 1 n δ d o i f i x δ t where x is the number of

mg l 1 d 1 can similarly be calculated as the product of rμ during the day sunrise to sunset 3 results 3 1 diel and seasonal variations of physicochemical parameters the variation average and timing of the diel cycles of the measured and calculated physicochemical parameters are summarized in table 1 all four sampling surveys at sites lwh and jl were conducted under conditions of no rainfall the duration of daylight changed from 10 44 12 54 13 22 and 11 16 h d 1 in january april july and october respectively table 2 the persistent cloudy conditions in april resulted in the lowest total daily insolation 2543 w m 2 d 1 during the four sampling periods compared to january 5317 w m 2 d 1 and july 7251 w m 2 d 1 and october 5249 w m 2 d 1 during the sampling period the wind speed was low and its amplitude of variation was small with the mean value decreasing from january 1 83 m s 1 to october 1 13 m s 1 table 2 the charge balances characterized by the normalized inorganic charge balance nicb 100 tz tz tz where tz k na 2ca2 2mg2 and tz hco3 cl no3 2so4 2 in μeq 10 6 charge equivalent units per liter is generally within 5 which is acceptable li et al 2011 in this study samples showed an nicb of 3 4 median and 2 4 mean indicating that the contribution of organic acids and ligands to the charge balance was not significant the diel cycles of t ph do and sic were almost in phase and showed increasing trends during the day and decreasing trends at night in contrast ec ca2 hco3 and pco2 decreased during the day and began to increase at night figs 2 and 3 the water temperature ranged from 14 7 c to 26 8 c with the highest values during the afternoon 13 00 16 00 and the lowest at around sunrise 5 00 7 00 as for t the lowest mean values of ph sic and do were in january and the largest amplitudes in the diel cycling of these parameters were in july the coefficients of variation cv of pco2 in jl and lwh were 0 2 0 7 and 0 2 0 6 respectively and the cv values of do were 0 1 0 3 and 0 2 0 3 respectively table 2 the changes in the hydrochemistry at the two sites in different seasons were highly consistent similar values and trends of physicochemical changes were also found at different water depths of the water column he et al 2019 which indicates that the lake water was well mixed during the diel monitoring period in january and april of 2017 the δ13cdic values were high during the day and low at night but they showed a completely different trend in july and october low values during the day and high values at night fig 4 the magnitude of the diel variability of δ13cdic at the two sites increased synchronously from january jl 1 22 lwh 1 50 to april jl 0 23 lwh 0 07 to july jl 0 26 lwh 1 30 following the same seasonal trend as the day length and water temperature 3 2 ecosystem metabolism from january to july 2017 the variations of gpp 19 57 g o2 m 2 d 1 and r 9 54 g o2 m 2 d 1 were of a similar magnitude and varied approximately in parallel increasing approximately twofold at both sites table 3 this likely reflects the increases in insolation t and biomass or the composition of aquatic organism assemblages one reason for this is that aquatic plants are dominant in shallow lakes and experience high metabolic rates during july the rates of gpp and r were higher at lwh than at jl but they were closely correlated over time which may indicate a common response to nutrient inputs as well as a well mixed water body compared to other deeper and larger lakes hanson et al 2003 solomon et al 2013 the rates of gpp and r in fuxian lake were relatively high and gave rise to substantial diel fluctuations in the rates of lake metabolism the balance between gpp and r nep at the two sites was predominantly positive during the day and negative at night in different seasons except for one day in october at jl 3 73 g o2 m 2 d 1 and for one day in april at lwh 6 76 g o2 m 2 d 1 at fuxian lake solar radiation could contribute to the diel cycle of heat content and be responsible for the changes in nep in different seasons however the nep in january was likely controlled mainly by the combined effects of solar radiation and wind the wind speed exceeded 6 m s 1 on the morning of january 18th intensifying the vertical heat transfer nep also showed diel variations with positive correlations with carbon cycling including hco3 pco2 sic and δ13cdic figs 5 and 6 which indicates that the nep and carbon cycling were linked and controlled by common mechanisms 4 discussion 4 1 origin of the diel variations in physicochemical and isotopic characteristics in our previous study of the seasonal variation of physical and chemical variables within different depth profiles from the northern central and southern parts of fuxian lake throughout 2017 we concluded that these variations were controlled mainly by the metabolism of aquatic phototrophs he et al 2019 however lake metabolism is poorly quantified and little is known about it on the diel timescale streamflow and groundwater inputs water temperature gaseous exchange carbonate precipitation and dissolution and biological processes could be the main mechanisms responsible for the diel physicochemical characteristics of lake surface waters jiang et al 2013 de montety et al 2011 nimick et al 2011 liu et al 2015 yang et al 2015 chen et al 2017 pu et al 2017 siebers et al 2020 herrera and nadaoka 2021 the effects of streamflow and groundwater inputs are considered to have negligible effects on the diel variability at sites lwh and jl due to the small lake catchment area and strong buffering capacity of fuxian lake he et al 2019 according to previous monitoring data little or no seasonal variations were observed in the physicochemical parameters of the groundwater which show a steady trend for instance do ranged from 5 7 to 6 5 6 2 on average and was low and stable in different seasons he et al 2019 and significantly lower than the lake water jl especially which is distant from major fluvial inputs has the same diel characteristics as lwh thus external inputs were not the main driver of the physicochemical variations as noted in a comprehensive summary nimick et al 2011 the water temperature may show more consistent diurnal variability than other physicochemical properties temperature changes can affect the ph on the diel scale either by changing the gaseous exchange rate between the water and atmosphere or by changing the solubility of calcite de montety et al 2011 liu et al 2015 it is noteworthy that less than 1 and 6 of the diel variations in ph and pco2 respectively can be explained by water temperature changes based on the hydrogeochemical simulation software phreeqc additionally although the changes in pco2 in the fuxian lake followed the temperature solubility rule the opposite trend in do was observed fig 7 this indicates that temperature was not the major control on the variations in ph pco2 and do on the diel timescale additionally the influence of temperature on gaseous exchange is difficult to separate from that of biological processes which are substantially driven by changes in solar radiation clearly both mechanisms need to be considered together gaseous exchange between air and water can induce variations in pco2 and do nimick et al 2011 although it has been shown that inland lakes tend to be co2 supersaturated with respect to the atmosphere cole et al 1994 khan et al 2020 the pco2 in fuxian lake was generally lower than that of the atmosphere during the day figs 2 and 3 additionally due to other processes such as respiration by aquatic plants co2 outgassing at night was not expected to have driven calcite precipitation indeed sic reached a minimum but remained positive and to have enriched the δ13cdic indeed a minimum value was attained of the residual dic fig 4 similarly the results show relatively low and highly consistent k values of 2 7 4 2 cm h 1 for the o2 diffusion coefficient across the air water interface in different seasons also as shown in fig 7 pco2 and do were strongly negatively correlated suggesting that degassing was not the major factor controlling pco2 and do as well as δ13cdic on the diel timescale during the day photosynthesis removes co2 i e causing the depletion of 12c in the remaining dic which thus increases the ph of the lake water and reduces the solubility of calcite which may drive calcite precipitation liu et al 2015 in most waters biological activity controls the co2 concentration which then influences the carbonate saturation de montety et al 2011 in fuxian lake sic generally increased to 1 during the day and ca2 decreased linearly with hco3 figs 2 and 3 which suggests the potential for calcite precipitation to occur conversely respiration at night increased the co2 concentration i e releasing 12co2 into the water decreased the ph and thus promoted calcite dissolution however no carbonate dissolution occurred in fuxian lake during the monitoring period because sic was always positive indicating oversaturation with respect to calcite figs 2 and 3 and the absence of carbonate dissolution at night therefore carbonate dissolution is unlikely to have driven the changes in hydrochemistry and δ13cdic several studies have shown that diel variations of pco2 and do are induced by the photosynthesis and respiration of aquatic plants e g nimick et al 2011 liu et al 2015 yang et al 2015 chen et al 2017 he et al 2019 pco2 and do follow opposite trends in fuxian lake fig 7 coinciding with the metabolic processes operating in aquatic ecosystems the diel variations of nutrients and do induced by biological activity have also received attention e g odum 1956 de montety et al 2011 during photosynthesis the no3 concentration decreases and the do concentration increases in response to the solar radiation level these characteristics can be observed in fuxian lake for example no3 was positively correlated with co2 r2 0 29 and negatively correlated with do r2 0 26 at lwh in april additionally when photosynthesis occurs during the day 12co2 absorption by aquatic organisms occurs more rapidly than that of 13co2 generally resulting in enriched δ13cdic values which were observed in january and april 2017 fig 4 in july and october however the opposite trend occurred fig 4 which may be related to the strong degradation of organic matter producing 13c depleted dic caused by the intensification of microbial activity parker et al 2010 and or the influx of atmospheric co2 and its kinetic fractionation the isotope fractionation value can reach 13 herczeg and fairbanks 1987 which is clearly shown by the observation that the pco2 in july and october was lower than in april and january and even lower than the atmospheric pco2 figs 2 and 3 in general more positive δ13cdic values in the surface water occurred in july and october when most of the photosynthesis occurs overall these observations emphasize the significant influence of biological metabolism on the hydrochemistry of fuxian lake 4 2 lake metabolism and its influence on carbon dynamics the foregoing results confirm the existence of a diel cycle of aquatic metabolism including aquatic photosynthesis and respiration and its influence on the hydrochemistry and c isotopes of fuxian lake as previously reported in both freshwater jiang et al 2013 liu et al 2015 yang et al 2015 chen et al 2017 pu et al 2017 siebers et al 2020 and marine ecosystems teichert coddington and green 1993 the variations in these processes determine the fate of the carbon cycle in aquatic systems nimick et al 2011 staehr et al 2012 quantifying the rates of the production and degradation of aquatic plants and other organic matter is of fundamental importance for understanding the cycling of carbon and for estimating the status and maintaining the health of aquatic ecosystems castro et al 2021 recent investigations of metabolism via nep in arctic subarctic temperate and tropical ecosystems have led to a better understanding of the contributions of aquatic ecosystems to carbon budgets both regionally and globally bates and mathis 2009 martinsen et al 2017 amaral et al 2018 andersen et al 2019 siebers et al 2020 herrera and nadaoka 2021 our study of the littoral zone of fuxian lake which has dense stands of submerged macrophytes has documented the temporal and spatial changes of metabolic rates and carbon species and we observed high rates and the close diel coupling of nep and carbon species figs 5 and 6 although respiration always occurs and may even be higher during the day than at night the gross primary production in fuxian lake exceeded the respiration gpp r positive nep and aquatic plants consumed dic co2aq hco3 and released o2 causing increases in ph sic and δ13cdic fig 8 photosynthesis ceased at night and respiration was dominant gpp r negative nep and aquatic plants consumed do and released dic thereby reducing the ph sic and δ13cdic fig 8 these observations indicate that the diel variations of the carbon cycle were largely controlled by the nep the nep was poorly correlated with wind speed on most occasions while it was more strongly correlated with solar radiation and water temperature which appears to be the main mechanism driving the changes in nep especially in july summer the nep reached a maximum under the high level of solar radiation and high water temperatures figs 5 and 6 although high temperatures could intensify photorespiration and mitochondrial respiration even further kragh et al 2017 as well as post depositional mineralization rates gudasz et al 2010 the increased primary productivity under the coupled effects of solar radiation and water temperature exceeded the effect of the increased respiration caused by temperature this finding is consistent with observations in lake geneva castro et al 2021 capitol lake yang et al 2019 la salada lake and sauce grande lake alfonso et al 2018 where solar radiation and water temperature were significantly positively correlated with the nep however it contrasts with the case of laguna lake in the philippines herrera and nadaoka 2021 which may be due to the absence of stable water column stratification in the rainy season indeed multiple factors are likely responsible for the difference as suggested by herrera and nadaoka 2021 for example the biomass and physiological state of aquatic plants are not only affected by the water temperature wind speed and solar radiation but also by the availability of inorganic nutrients the structure of the food web and the mixing regime theoretically the nep is higher in the growing season which is also the case at fuxian lake because of the strong solar radiation in summer and the flourishing of aquatic plants our paired do pco2 measurements support this viewpoint i e do reached a maximum of 16 31 mg l 1 and pco2 reached a minimum of 5 31 pa during the monitoring period fig 7 additionally during the summer productivity peak in shallow water when co2aq depletion occurred except for the influence of possible atmospheric co2 invasion with corresponding depleted δ13cdic values herczeg and fairbanks 1987 the hco3 likely supports these high levels of gpp and nep additionally we found that in the afternoon of different seasons pco2 and hco3 varied synchronously as did do figs 5 and 6 the dic store in the form of hco3 has developed two mechanisms to support gpp 1 chemical exchange with co2 via hydration and ionization reactions and 2 the co2 concentrating mechanism in submerged plants and algae aho et al 2021 this may be why the gpp r ratio in fuxian lake is higher than that of other lakes fig 9 which likely indicates that karst lakes with high dic support high primary production positive nep values were concentrated in the interval from sunrise to shortly after noon while they were close to zero in the late afternoon and strongly negative at night in all seasons from morning to afternoon solar radiation t do and ph increased substantially corresponding to decreased dic co2aq hco3 which is likely the cause of the decrease in nep at this time figs 5 and 6 this is supported by in situ experiments which showed that in water rich in dic and with a hypoxic state the photosynthesis of charophyte shoots cultured in surface water lacking dic and dissolved oxygen was significantly reduced kragh et al 2017 the littoral zone in fuxian lake is dominated by submerged plants which may have evolved co2 concentrating mechanisms ccms that enable cells to increase the co2 concentration in cellular microcompartments to levels at which the carbon fixing enzyme rubisco can operate efficiently dülger et al 2017 due to the competitive interaction of the carboxylase and oxygenase activity of rubisco the co2 o2 quotient at the site of activity is the result of the balance between photosynthetic co2 utilization and photorespiratory co2 depletion sand jensen and frost christensen 1998 therefore a lower dic and higher oxygen concentration lower dic do and or co2aq do could limit photosynthesis in the late afternoon in fuxian lake figs s1 s4 the low co2 o2 ratio could also increase the photorespiration rate of aquatic plants although the determination of the threshold needs further research 4 3 fuxian lake as a net autotrophic ecosystem and its role as a metabolic sink for c understanding the balance of these metabolic processes is important because it defines the role of aquatic ecosystems in the global carbon cycle that is whether they are a source or sink of atmospheric carbon duarte and agustí 1998 in this study we compared the gpp and r of aquatic communities to determine whether fuxian lake hence potentially other lakes also was a carbon source gpp r nep 0 or sink gpp r nep 0 fig 9 shows that r is associated with the ecosystem gpp and the slope of the power equation is close to 1 r2 0 74 p 0 0001 n 14 which falls mainly within the field of lake aquatic ecosystems compiled by hoellein et al 2013 the nep values in fuxian lake in july summer ranged from 3 0 to 12 9 g o2 m 2 d 1 with the mean value of 7 7 g o2 m 2 d 1 25 globally distributed lakes had a mean summer nep value ranging from 7 3 to 9 9 g o2 m 2 d 1 as compiled by solomon et al 2013 due to the small catchment area and long water retention time 167 years of fuxian lake the spatial heterogeneity of metabolism was low figs 5 6 and 9 indicating that the surface layer is well mixed horizontally positive nep values across the four seasons for the two monitoring sites 6 6 g o2 m 2 d 1 on average indicate that the lake ecosystem was net autotrophic and acted as a co2 sink to assess the potential atmospheric fluxes of c produced by lake metabolism in fuxian lake gpp r and nep need to be converted to carbon units g c m 2 a 1 during photosynthesis aquatic primary productivity consumes co2 and produces o2 in the molar ratio o2 co2 of 1 2 lefèvre and merlivat 2012 aho et al 2021 in contrast the molar ratio of co2 o2 for respiration with o2 is 106 138 steinsberger et al 2021 at the two monitoring sites in fuxian lake the co2 sink flux by aquatic plants had the ranges of 0 7 345 7 g c m 2 d 1 at jl and 85 0 515 5 g c m 2 d 1 at lwh obtained by calculation with the corresponding fluxes of 902 t c km 2 yr 1 and 833 t c km 2 yr 1 respectively demonstrating an important potential co2 sink the metabolic organic carbon sink produced by the biological carbon pump bcp promotes the conversion from dic to oc and the magnitudes 833 902 t c km 2 yr 1 in fuxian lake a karst lake are similar to our previous result estimated by ion dic ca2 mass balance at the epikarst aquatic photosynthesis rate 285 852 t c km 2 yr 1 liu et al 2015 yang et al 2015 and is slightly higher than the shawan karst test site 156 493 t c km 2 yr 1 chen et al 2017 these rates are 25 81 times higher than that of the oceanic biological pump devries and weber 2017 additionally we found that at fuxian lake 78 of inorganic carbon sources are photosynthetically fixed by aquatic plants in the form of hco3 based on a carbon isotope model he and li 2021 from which the carbon sink flux can be seen to reach 650 704 t c km 2 yr 1 these findings demonstrate the great potential of the combination of terrestrial aquatic photosynthesis and carbonate weathering for c sequestration therefore atmospheric co2 uptake by the coupling of carbonate weathering with the aquatic photosynthesis mechanism should be considered within the regional and global carbon cycle and in climate models 4 4 the role of karst lakes in the regional and global carbon cycle eutrophic aquatic ecosystems are generally regarded as a net co2 sink due to the high allochthonous inputs of inorganic nutrients e g n p that could drive the conversion rate of dic to oc michelle and john 2011 whereas oligotrophic aquatic ecosystems act as a net co2 source and their primary productivity is controlled by cycling processes driven by heterotrophic organisms duarte and agustí 1998 on this basis oligotrophic fuxian lake should be a heterotrophic lake although the metabolism monitoring in this study was not conducted in the center of the lake net autotrophy is anticipated for fuxian lake considering the low organic supply from its small watershed and the deep water environment together with the fact that autochthonous organic carbon deposition occupies a dominant position chen et al 2018 he et al 2019 2020 the nep evaluation supports the notion that the shallow water areas of large deep water lakes are important components of global carbon processing which is often overlooked at the same time the increasing eutrophication of such lakes will induce more autochthonous deposition and hence co2 emissions to the atmosphere are expected to decrease liu et al 2021 ran et al 2021 the dic mainly hco3 utilization by aquatic plants especially submerged plants dülger et al 2017 is higher in karst lakes than in non karst lakes liu et al 2018 liu et al 2017 confirmed the conversion of dic to autochthonous organic carbon aoc through 14c analysis in the pearl river basin later at the karst test site chen et al 2017 bao et al 2022 and in the yangtze river and yellow river liu et al 2021 zhao et al 2022 the so called dic fertilization effect was identified in which more aoc and phytoplankton biomass was produced with higher concentrations of dic additionally several studies identified a priming effect on the breakdown of both aquatic plants and terrestrially derived c ward et al 2016 which means that o2 can be consumed by primary production and allochthonous organic matter in an aerobic environment thus a substantial part of the co2 emissions results from the degradation of allochthonous organic matter further our research on karst aquatic ecosystems showed that chemoheterotrophy was significantly reduced in high dic and ca2 environments and that chemoheterotrophic planktonic bacteria were fewer based on the dominant functional gene predicted by functional annotation of the prokaryotic taxa xia et al 2022 therefore it is important to determine whether the influence of lake metabolism on the carbon cycle is specific to karst aquatic ecosystems differences in the carbon budgets of karst lakes and non karst lakes were also observed in several previous studies finlay et al 2009 tranvik et al 2009 karst lakes in the northern great plains showed a net influx of co2 and efficient sediment storage finlay et al 2009 relative to the non karst lakes in the boreal catchment sobek et al 2006 this difference could be explained by the simplified conceptual model shown in fig 10 hard water lakes characterized by high ph and dic but lower co2 concentrations have been confirmed by statistical research on the global scale duarte et al 2008 coupled with the efficient utilization of dic by aquatic plants may further deplete dissolved co2 additionally aoc is resistant to microbial remineralization in high dic and ca2 environments xia et al 2022 which may also reduce co2 emissions and aoc storage thus high aoc sedimentary storage and precipitated caco3 were both observed in karst lakes in the northern great plains finlay et al 2009 which may confirm the occurrence of a strong bcp effect liu et al 2018 he et al 2020 finally it is worth noting that the northern hardwater lakes shifted progressively from being substantial co2 sources in the mid 1990s to sequestering co2 by 2010 with increasing atmospheric warming and ph finlay et al 2015 this decrease in co2 efflux may be due mainly to increasing aquatic photosynthesis liu et al 2021 additionally hco3 showed a steady trend of increase of 2 1 2 6 from 1950 to 2100 under a future climate and land use scenario zeng et al 2019 in the context of global climate change and lake eutrophication a large amount of autochthonous production should therefore likely suffice to drive aquatic ecosystems especially the biota of karst aquatic ecosystems towards net autotrophy acting as a co2 sink we recognize that such simple up scaling has its limitations and we also note that small continental waters should not be ignored in virtually all global processes and cycles downing 2010 williams et al 2013 holgerson 2015 holgerson and raymond 2016 marcé et al 2019 in which the processes and mechanisms of the carbon cycle especially the impact of the differential contributions of autochthonous and allochthonous source need to be clarified therefore further research is needed to evaluate the importance of dic rich lakes in the magnitude and direction of c fluxes in the global c cycle 5 conclusions diel observations are crucial for understanding the biogeochemical cycling that governs subtropical lake aquatic ecosystems the efficiency of the utilization by aquatic phototrophs of the dissolved inorganic carbon produced by carbonate weathering is an important factor in determining the magnitude of the carbon sink which can be estimated from diel observation of the hydrochemical and metabolism characteristics of surface waters our monitoring of the diel variations of the hydrochemistry of fuxian lake revealed that it was controlled principally by the photosynthesis and respiration of aquatic communities which is confirmed by quantitative metabolic parameters the impact of lake metabolism on the lake carbon dynamics also reveals the importance of the biological carbon pump in supporting the high primary production in karst lakes an additional discovery is that positive nep values were concentrated during the interval from sunrise to shortly after noon while they were close to zero in the late afternoon in all seasons which can be explained by the effects of the lower co2 o2 ratio in limiting photosynthesis and increasing the potential for the photorespiration of aquatic plants fuxian lake was found to be predominantly a net autotrophic ecosystem gpp r 1 nep 0 i e primary production exceeds respiration suggesting that the lake functions more as a sink than a source of atmospheric carbon the estimated organic carbon sink produced by the metabolism of aquatic plants in fuxian lake reached 833 902 t c km 2 yr 1 or around one order of magnitude higher than the oceanic biological pump combined with carbonate weathering the carbon sink flux will reach 650 704 t c km 2 yr 1 indicating the crucial role of lacustrine aquatic photosynthesis in sequestering the carbon caused by the coupling of carbonate weathering with aquatic photosynthesis our findings demonstrate the importance of continuous monitoring on the diel scale in highly dynamic lake ecosystems additionally they emphasize that the shallow water environment of deep water lakes is an important component of global carbon processing that cannot be ignored and that the inputs of large amounts of autochthonous organic carbon in karst aquatic systems have the ability to drive aquatic ecosystems towards net autotrophy and act as a co2 sink accordingly future studies should incorporate better estimates of lake metabolism and their influence on carbon cycling to more fully evaluate the role of lakes especially karst lakes in regional and global carbon budgets declaration of competing interest the authors

15664,natural sediment flocs are fragile and highly heterogeneous aggregates of biogenic and minerogenic material typically with high porosity and low density in aquatic environments dominated by fine cohesive or mixed sediments they can dominate suspended sediment flux consequently monitoring and modelling the behaviour transport and distribution of flocs is very important for many aquatic industries maintenance of waterways and conservation and management of aquatic waterbodies mathematical models that predict the behaviour of flocs rely on the accurate assessments of the size shape density porosity and fractal dimension of flocs these inherently 3 dimensional 3d characteristics are typically derived from 2 dimensional 2d data largely due to the challenges associated with sampling capturing imaging and quantifying these fragile aggregates we have developed new volumetric microscopy techniques which can quantify 3d internal and external structures and characteristics of sediment flocs here these techniques were applied to quantify the 3d size volume shape and fractal dimension of natural and artificial sediment flocs and compare them to standard 2d approaches our study demonstrates that 2d approaches are under estimating shape complexity and over estimating the size and mass settling flux of flocs by up to two orders of magnitude and the discrepancy between 2d and 3d is most marked for natural organic rich macroflocs our study has significant implications for estimations of sediment flux at local to global scales within in aquatic environments these new data and approaches offer the potential to improve the current parameterisation of sediment transport models and to improve the accuracy of current field monitoring techniques graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords density porosity fractal dimension cohesive shape 1 introduction natural sediment flocs are fragile highly heterogeneous aggregates of minerogenic and biogenic material with fluid filled pore space burd and jackson 2009 droppo 2001 and can represent the main component of suspended particulate matter spm in both natural and engineered aquatic systems where sediment supply is dominated by fine grained cohesive and mixed sediments mehta 2013 whitehouse et al 2000 spm transport is critical to the fate and flux of sediment manning and dyer 2007 prandle et al 2005 spearman et al 2020 carbon nutrients contaminants ye et al 2021 and pathogens through all aquatic environments therefore characterising flocs and predicting their dynamic behaviour is essential for the sustainable management of waterways ports and harbours fisheries and marine industries spearman et al 2020 winterwerp et al 2006 floc behaviour is dependant upon the size shape fractal dimension density and porosity of floc aggregates and such data are critical input parameters for the mathematical models that predict fine sediment transport and flocculation dukhovskoy et al 2021 mehta et al 2014 sheremet et al 2017 these characteristics are challenging to measure because flocs are fragile and difficult to sample without altering their structure many et al 2019 and range in size from colloidal particles nanometres to larger aggregates 1000s microns spanning multiple measurement and observation techniques these characteristics are nearly always measured in 2 dimensions 2d floc size considered to be the most important parameter to determine settling velocity and is determined as the spherical or elliptical diameter of a 2d projection from video image or laser analysis winterwerp 1998 floc shape is commonly measured as simple 2d height to width ratios or shape parameters based on regression analysis whilst some sediment transport models use characteristic shapes based on fractal mathematics lee et al 2011 moruzzi et al 2020 williams et al 2008 winterwerp 1998 and fractal dimension a proxy for floc complexity is also usually derived in 2d smoczyński et al 2016 with a fractal dimension of 1 indicating near spherical flocs with larger values up to 3 indicative of looser more complex flocs in addition porosity and density which can influence settling behaviour through buoyancy and drag as fluid flows through the floc moruzzi et al 2020 can only be estimated indirectly from settling velocity and assuming spherical shape therefore these inherently 3 dimensional 3d characteristics are only ever measured or estimated from 2d simplifications spencer et al 2021 recently new volumetric microscopy techniques have been developed and validated which can image and quantify 3d internal and external structures characteristics and composition of sediment flocs with minimal disturbance spencer et al 2021 wheatland et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 these operate across nano to micro scales and therefore have the potential to quantify all meaningful floc characteristics including size shape fractal dimension porosity and density spencer et al 2021 in addition we have developed techniques to capture and stabilise natural sediment flocs whilst preserving these delicate 3d structures wheatland et al 2017 the overall aim of this study was to quantify for the first time the detailed 3d geometry and structures of sediment flocs using x ray microtomography microct our objectives were to quantify the 3d size shape and fractal dimension of artificial and natural sediment flocs and compare these new quantitative 3d data to measurements derived using 2d image analysis techniques in a settling column we then considered the application of these new 3d data streams to improve the accuracy and current application of 2d data with respects to 3d measurements and to improve our understanding and prediction of floc behaviour in the aquatic environment 2 methodology 2 1 general methodological approach in order to compare the geometric structure and physical characteristics of flocs in both 2d and 3d we modified the laboratory spectral flocculation characteristics settling column and floc camera system labsfloc fig 1 manning et al 2017 manning and dyer 2002 floc images were captured as floc populations settled past the camera system to obtain 2d data an agarose filled plankton chamber was fitted to the bottom of the labsfloc column to capture and immobilise settled flocs for analysis of 3d data by microct thus whilst it is not possible to match 2d and 3d measurements for individual flocs we are sampling the same floc population in both 2d and 3d once the flocs had settled the water within the labsfloc column was drained and the plankton chamber capped with a glass coverslip the water within the plankton chamber was then exchanged with a saline solution 35 psu containing low melting point electrophoresis grade agarose at 0 75 plankton chambers were stored at 4 c for 30 min to enable the agarose to solidify these agarose discs contained 1000 s of individual flocs and were placed in sample holders and mounted on the microct stage for scanning and analysis of 3d geometry flocs are very fragile and it is possible that sampling and processing may deform or modify their physical chemical and biological characteristics the agarose prevented any physical chemical or biological interactions between the flocs including minimising deformation during settling and sedimentation droppo et al 1996 whilst the numbers of flocs collected were low enough not to overwhelm to the plankton chamber our methodological approach for capturing stabilising and imaging fragile flocs in 3d is outlined in detail in wheatland et al 2017 2020 and spencer et al 2021 and successfully stabilised and preserved floc structures observations at the nanoscale 3d tomography demonstrated minimal shrinkage deformation and or alteration to 3d structure wheatland et al 2017 to optimise comparability between the 2d and 3d datasets the resolution of microct scans voxel size 10 µm was matched as closely as possible that of the labsfloc imagery pixel size 6 7 µm time requirements associated with data capture and computational processing mean that settling runs were not routinely replicated however in this study total sample number n is very large up to 10 000 s of flocs and our focus was to compare the relative 2d and 3d characteristics of floc populations rather than to quantify the characteristics of a floc population with given composition and physicochemical water column conditions 2 2 floc populations cohesive sediments were flocculated in a mini annular flume in artificial seawater at 35 psu and a suspended particulate matter spm concentration of 1 5 g l 1 to examine wide ranging and contrasting floc sizes and shapes four floc populations were considered three artificial flocs comprising bentonite clay and increasing concentrations of xanthan gum proxy for organic matter at 0 01 2 and 5 and a natural estuarine cohesive sediment sampled from the thames estuary se england silty clay organic matter 15 based on loss on ignition flocs were extracted from the annular flume following 11 days suspension using a wide mouthed pipette to avoid floc breakage manning and dyer 2002 and transferred to the modified labsfloc settling column 2 3 acquisition of 2d datasets 2d floc characteristic datasets including size projected area and diameter and shape aspect ratio circularity were collected by recording floc images in the labsfloc using a high definition camera manning and dyer 2002 ye et al 2020 and processed using trainable weka arganda carreras et al 2017 and trackmate tinevez et al 2017 packages within imagej 2 4 acquisition of 3d datasets a detailed description of the use of microct to acquire and quantify 3d volumetric floc datasets is provided in wheatland et al 2020 microct scans were performed using a nikon metrology xt h 225 tokyo japan micro tomograph this scanner was configured with a 25 225 kv 0 2000 µa x ray source with tungsten reflection target capable of generating polychromatic x rays focal spot size c 3 μm and a perkin elmer waltham massachusetts usa 16 bit flat panel detector scan parameters were set to optimise contrast and resolution voltage 150 kv current 160 μa acquisition time between projections 2829 ms with 2 frame averaging maintaining the same scan parameters for all x ray datasets ensured that their greyscale values and hence feature identification would be comparable the greyscale values of the resulting raw projections represented differences in x ray energy attenuation related to material density and the attenuation coefficient of the materials being imaged the x ray microct generated 2d projections of the sample that were reconstructed to generate 3d cubic data volumes for visualisation and quantification the reconstruction of x ray microct datasets was conducted using ctpro 3d nikon tokyo japan each scan generated 1609 raw x ray projections yielding reconstructed volumes with dimensions of 2048 2048 2048 voxels with a voxel size of 10 µm during reconstruction imaging artefacts e g beam hardening caused by the differential attenuation of x rays through materials of differing density and thickness ketcham and carlson 2001 were addressed by the application of specific algorithms 2 5 segmentation and quantification of 2d and 3d data the quantification of both 2d and 3d data required material segmentation i e the classification of material phases based on greyscale values and or shape cnudde and boone 2013 segmentation of the datasets generated binary images of each component bulk phase which was achieved in fiji imagej via using the semi automated segmentation tool trainable weka segmentation tws v2 1 0 capable of machine learning arganda carreras et al 2017 resulting binary volumes of each bulk phase were then quantified using the 2d particle analyzer and 3d roi manager plugins ollion et al 2013 in fiji imagej which provided quantitative measurements of material properties e g size shape and greyscale intensities in the literature flocs are frequently considered to be spherical objects due to the challenges of measuring their complex shapes and the ease of estimating their settling velocity by applying stokes law khelifa and hill 2006 many et al 2019 moruzzi et al 2020 our approach allows the quantification of the size of a complex 3d object floc volume and this was compared to standard approaches to assess floc size using equivalent spherical diameter esd the perimeter diameter d perim surface equivalent diameter d surf circumscribing diameter d circum and the feret diameter d feret definitions are provided in supporting information table s1 shape was described using aspect ratio e g height to width ratios 2d and 3d circularity 2d and sphericity 3d to measure the fractal dimension of the flocs from the voxel pixel images we used the sphere circle packing method similar to the box counting method here circles were used to cover the area of the floc in 2d and spheres were used to cover the volume of the floc in 3d 3 results data from artificial and natural sediment flocs were combined to provide a dataset with wide ranging floc characteristics and to compare relative 2d and 3d geometry the number of flocs captured observed and quantified varied considerably in total our dataset comprised observations for 22 744 flocs in 2d i e images captured as they passed through the field of view for the labsfloc camera however as a large number of these flocs settled outside the plankton chamber and were not captured for analysis by microct a smaller population sub set of 7974 flocs was quantified in 3d 3 1 2 dimensional floc data the particle size distribution measured as floc area is given in fig 2 a and ranged from 40 µm2 to 6 105 µm2 this is a direct measurement of floc size based on occupied pixels converted to a geometric scale micron and shows a broadly bi modal distribution with two population peaks and a median floc area of 889 µm2 to comply with conventions for measuring floc size and enable comparison between 2d and 3d data we created floc size distributions using equivalent spherical diameter esd the perimeter diameter d perim surface equivalent diameter d surf circumscribing diameter d circum and the feret diameter d feret fig 3 all approaches show a broadly bi modal floc size distribution this aligns to previous in situ and laboratory observations of flocs indicating the presence of c 10 µm diameter flocs comprising flocculi and or primary particles fettweis et al 2012 shen et al 2018 spencer et al 2021 and a larger floc population between c 10 µm and 1000 µm diameter this also appears a good representation of our samples comprising small compact low om bentonite flocs through to large organic rich natural estuarine sediment flocs the modal size of the smaller secondary population may not be observed due to our analytical detection limits and data filtering and therefore the number of smaller flocs with diameter 10 µm are almost certainly under represented some authors observe further separations of these larger 10 µm floc populations e g manning and schoellhamer 2013 observed separate floc populations with diameters 160 µm microflocs and 160 µm macroflocs but such distributions were not seen here and may indicate the dominance of smaller artificial flocs in our population the esd was in the same order of magnitude for all approaches used although d50 was greatest for d circum d feret d perim d surf anova f 3 90 972 278 p 2 2 10 16 and ranged from 34 43 μm while d max showed much greater variation ranging from 941 1814 μm d perim d circum d feret d surf shape is also frequently used to characterise floc populations as it may be indicative of floc composition with organic rich flocs having elongate stringer shapes and shape influences settling velocity and drag moruzzi et al 2020 individual flocs exhibited aspect ratios ranging from 1 0 to 9 1 median 1 3 and circularity ranging from 0 09 to 1 median 1 both measures indicate that the floc population is very strongly dominated by near spherical flocs again confirming the presence of small compact flocs predominantly from our artificial floc populations the majority of flocs had a fractal dimension between 1 5 and 2 in 2d ranging from 1 02 to 2 25 with a median of 1 76 indicative of our compact simple artificial flocs and stringer type natural sediment flocs 3 2 2 dimensional floc data macroflocs larger flocs here defined as those with d 160 µm e g manning and schoelhammer 2013 have been analysed separately from the total floc population as they tend to have more complex shapes and contribute significantly to mass settling flux manning and dyer 2007 soulsby et al 2013 the choice of approach for estimating esd results in varying proportions of macroflocs table 1 macroflocs contribute between 1 9 d surf to 3 6 d circum of the total population but between 40 and 50 of the total area occupied by the floc population i e viewed and measured as projected areas in 2d as expected macroflocs have less spherical shapes with median h l c 1 6 and median circularity c 0 5 showing little variation between the esd characterisation methods used observations indicate that macroflocs are notably more variable in shape and more elongate indicative of larger probably more organic rich flocs in our natural floc population 3 3 3 dimensional floc data the use of volumetric tomography enables quantification of floc size measured as occupied volume and the floc volume distribution is shown in fig 2b this again shows a broadly bimodal distribution but now the smallest floc population volume 1000 µm3 is much more dominant although it may still be under represented due to detection limitations floc volumes ranged from 1000 µm3 i e one voxel to 1 9 107 µm3 with a median floc volume of 12 996 µm3 esd was derived using the same approaches as the 2d data to enable comparison fig 4 floc esd is in the same order of magnitude for all approaches but there were significant differences in floc size anova f 4 31 892 150 6 p 2 10 16 between the different calculation methods where d50 ranges between 29 and 37 μm dperim dcircum dferet dsurf and dmax ranged from 330 to 840 µm dcircum dferet dperim dsurf the most striking difference is the relative dominance of the smaller floc population in the floc size distributions fig 4a d and the bimodal distribution is far less pronounced when measured using dferet adapting the approaches used in 2d esd was then used to estimate equivalent spherical volume esv and compared to the measured floc volumes occupied voxels generated by microct analysis table 2 there is a statistically significant over estimation of volume when d perim d circum and d feret are used anova f 4 39 865 74 35 p 2 10 16 followed by post hoc tukey test with the estimated median floc size doubled d perim and maximum floc size increased by up to an order of magnitude compared with the measured flocs compared to measurements in 2d 3d floc shape measured as sphericity 3d equivalent of circularity was less variable and far less spherical ranging from 0 26 to 0 73 with a median value of 0 57 whilst aspect ratios varied from 1 to 3 5 indicative of much more elongate flocs the majority of the flocs have a fractal dimension between 2 5 and 3 in 3d with a median of 2 7 suggesting more complexity than the 2d measures 3 4 3 dimensional floc data macroflocs as for the 2d data larger flocs 160 µm diameter were analysed separately the method for estimating esd has far greater consequence on the estimation of macrofloc contribution to the floc population when derived from volume for example table 3 demonstrates that macroflocs contribute between 1 and 5 of the total number of flocs but between 27 and 66 of the total volume occupied by flocculated material the shape of the macroflocs is again more complex and more elongate with macrofloc sphericity ranging from 0 26 to 0 63 with most macroflocs having sphericity 0 5 4 discussion 4 1 floc size distribution to enable statistical comparisons both 2d and 3d data were filtered to account for differences in the limit of detection hence particles 32 pixels 404 µm2 labsfloc 900 µm2 micro ct in 2d and 33 voxels 27 000 µm3 micro ct in 3d were excluded from the analysis this means that for both populations the smallest flocs are not represented in the datasets but the lower limit of detection across 2d and 3d data are broadly comparable measuring floc size as diameter has been a key parameter in the assessment monitoring and prediction of cohesive and mixed sediment behaviour as floc size is considered the most important control on settling velocity and hence fine and cohesive sediment dynamics williams et al 2008 in this study we were able to directly quantify floc size from 2d projections and quantification of occupied pixels area as the floc population settled past the labsfloc camera and in 3d as a measure of occupied volume this is in contrast with most commonly applied techniques in the field e g laser in situ scattering and transmissometry lisst in situ settling velocity instrument inssev and laboratory e g floc camera image analysis that derive floc size data from 2d projections and use ellipse fitting to estimate esd the most significant contrast between the two approaches is in the distribution of floc size the distribution of floc area shows a clear bimodal distribution and this is confirmed when observing the distribution of floc size using all four different measures of esd the bi modal distribution becomes most pronounced when using the feret diameter as a measure of esd which is the most widely applied approach the feret diameter is a statistical measure of diameter and is considered a valid estimate of floc size if sufficient measurements are made as is the case here with 20 000 floc measurements as this accounts for any orientation of flocs as they settle jarvis et al 2005 however this bi modal distribution becomes significantly less apparent when accurate measurements of floc size as volume are presented fig 2b and the distribution seen here is more of a size continuum which is then dominated by the smallest class size of flocs 10 µm diameter these observations are in contrast to the frequent reports of distinct multi modal distributions of floc size derived from 2d data these floc size distributions underpin 3d transport modelling of cohesive and mixed sediments by assigning variable fractal dimensions such observed multi modal floc size distributions are caused by mixing of different sized particles and aggregates particularly in coastal and estuarine settings lee et al 2012 and are attributed to different mechanisms of floc aggregation vahedi and gorczyca 2014 with two e g mikkelsen et al 2006 three shen et al 2018 and four lee et al 2012 levels of aggregation observed such levels of aggregation represent small compact highly spherical primary particles and highly stable microflocs or flocculi which are dominated by electroflocculation and larger more complex floc aggregates where bioflocculation and polymer bridging become increasingly important fettweis et al 2012 lee et al 2012 maggi 2007 these multiple levels of floc aggregation or floc hierarchy are based on observations of multi modal floc size distributions derived from 2d data and are used to assign variable fractal dimension and represent flocculation processes using multiple class population balance equations pbe shen et al 2018 however our 3d data particularly for flocs 10 µm diameter demonstrate a continuum of floc size this is supported by spencer et al 2021 who confirm that floc hierarchy is better defined by structure function relationships rather than observations of geometric floc size distributions with key flocculation mechanisms operating across the floc size distribution this suggests that multi modal floc size distributions observed in 2d may be largely an artefact of how 2d size is measured rather than an accurate reflection of floc size modes with potential implications for the efficacy of predictive cohesive sediment transport models that use assigned variable fractal dimensions 4 2 quantifying floc size and shape floc size is generally reported assuming spherical elliptical shape either as equivalent spherical diameter esd or e g the sauter mean diameter an equivalent volume surface area ratio used in in situ measurements using lisst sensors filippa et al 2011 it is recognised that these are 2d measurements and may not capture the true floc morphology here it is clear that floc size derived from 2d data whether as counts of projected 2d area or using multiple methods for the estimation of esd is over estimated with respect to measurement of floc size volume quantified in 3d these differences are modest and statistical measures to explore the population e g median are within the same order of magnitude however these differences become very significant when considering the largest flocs dmax and these over estimations are most pronounced when using measures such as the perimeter or circumference equivalent spherical diameter which take into account the projected floc outline and are hence influenced by floc shape and complexity this suggests that these over estimations are likely due to the significant simplification of floc shape and become more pronounced when considering the larger macrofloc populations 160 µm diameter which contain our natural organic rich flocculated estuarine sediments the measures for floc shape are simplistic and we are restricted to aspect ratio the ratio of smallest to longest diameter which considers how elongate the floc is and circularity sphericity relationship between the floc perimeter and area volume which roughly describes how irregular the shapes are relative to a simple circle or sphere 3d measurements indicate that flocs are far more elongate and irregular in shape compared to 2d measurements recent 3d imagery of natural estuarine sediment flocs confirms the complexity and shape irregularity of natural sediment flocs and the influence of biological populations on floc shape spencer et al 2021 wheatland et al 2020 2017 therefore measures of floc size in controlled laboratory experiments using simple minerogenic sediments are likely to provide good estimations of floc size but this becomes increasingly unreliable for natural organic rich sediments the over estimation of floc size in 2d has been previously recognised particularly where flocs become preferentially orientated during settling presenting the longest axis to the floc camera jarvis et al 2005 however the over simplification of floc shape in 2d may have additional consequences firstly over estimation of size is more significant for the largest flocs which have more complex and elongate shapes and this may result in the artificial creation of a bimodal floc distribution where larger flocs become over represented in the floc population this is confirmed by a more continuous size distribution when size is quantified from 3d data secondly estimations of floc size from 2d projections and estimates of esd will result in a significant amount of empty space surrounding the floc being attributed to the floc with significant consequences for the estimations of floc density and porosity which are typically derived from settling velocity and assumptions of spherical shape utilising stokes law 4 3 consequences for understanding and predicting the dynamics of cohesive and mixed sediments floc size diameter is considered to be the most important floc parameter influencing settling velocity droppo 2001 fennessy et al 1994 gibbs 1985 li and ganczarczyk 1987 however shape porosity and density also have an impact with shape affecting drag density having an influence on the force driving settling velocity and porosity through affecting internal friction as water moves through the floc body li and ganczarczyk 1988 wu and lee 1998 these 3d data suggest that we are currently under estimating or inadequately representing floc shape and or irregularity this results in over estimation of floc size by up to an order of magnitude for large organic rich natural sediment flocs and means that we are probably over estimating floc porosity by including empty space surrounding irregular shaped flocs and thus by default underestimating floc density the frequently observed relationships between increasing floc size and decreasing density increasing porosity fennessy et al 1994 gibbs 1985 have dictated the application of fractal mathematics to account for floc variability in cohesive sediment transport modelling yet these data suggest that our estimations of density and porosity are better explained by increasing floc complexity and shape irregularity with size particularly for natural sediments and this may confirm some observations of the relationships between floc density and shape choi et al 2018 in addition there is increasing evidence that floc shape both variability and complexity has a significant impact on settling velocity although floc shape is rarely measured choi et al 2018 many et al 2019 these new data now provide the opportunity to develop algorithms that significantly improve the characterisation and quantification of floc shape parameters as well as direct quantification of floc size and porosity over estimating floc size may have significant consequences for estimation of the flux of sediment carbon nutrients and pollutants through the aquatic environment to explore the potential impact on mass settling flux we used average floc effective density values for microfloc d 160 µm 200 kg m 3 and macrofloc d 160 µm 50 kg m 3 fractions from 207 data sets i e individual floc populations from the tamar uk gironde france and dollard netherlands estuaries manning and dyer 2007 suspended sediment concentrations between 5 mg l 1 and 8600 mg l 1 then using both floc volume quantified in 3d and estimated from the 2d feret esd we estimated floc mass considering median floc size there is no significant difference in the data suggesting that for the majority of our simple compact near spherical artificial flocs that the use of 2d data makes little difference to estimations of mass settling flux this is expected as near spherical flocs are approximately rotationally symmetric thus a 2d projection contains comparable information to the full 3d geometry however for the largest flocs the use of 2d data over estimates floc mass by up to 1 order of magnitude for the microfloc populations and two orders of magnitude for the macrofloc populations whilst these calculations are approximations they are indicative of the substantial errors that may be propagated by modelling approaches that rely on 2d floc size particularly where natural sediments are forming large eps rich organic flocs with complex and or elongate shapes the imaging and data processing approaches used here are operator and computer processor intensive therefore at present our approach is unlikely to be adapted for application as part of e g a field monitoring campaign without significant modification however the coupled 2d 3d methodological approach allows accurate quantification of the errors associated with 2d measurements and enables geometric measures of 3d floc structure size shape porosity density to be related to measures of floc dynamics such as settling velocity and flocculation rates the possibility of translating 2d data to 3d predictions via simple relations was explored and a power law relation with an exponent slightly larger than 2 was found y 0 702 x2 394 whilst it is not yet clear whether this result is universal for all flocs with varying composition the use of a simple power law relationship between 2d and 3d data provides an approach whereby current field based techniques such as lisst can provide significantly more realistic measures of the complex structures and characteristics of natural heterogeneous sediment flocs 5 conclusions x ray microtomography offers the opportunity to quantify the 3d structure and physical properties of artificial and natural sediment flocs including volumetric size floc size distribution and shape across a range of scales from a few to 1000s microns new 3d data indicate that bi and multi modal floc size distributions which are typically used to assign variable fractal dimensions may be an artefact of 2d simplification of complex 3d shapes new 3d data demonstrate a level of complexity and irregularity in floc shape characteristics that cannot be accounted for in 2d shape descriptors this indicates that porosity may also be over estimated for flocs measuring floc size assuming spherical or elliptical shapes from 2d projections over estimates the size of individual flocs and the mass of flocculated material by up to two orders of magnitude this is most pertinent for natural large highly organic flocs and has consequences for estimations of the flux of

15664,natural sediment flocs are fragile and highly heterogeneous aggregates of biogenic and minerogenic material typically with high porosity and low density in aquatic environments dominated by fine cohesive or mixed sediments they can dominate suspended sediment flux consequently monitoring and modelling the behaviour transport and distribution of flocs is very important for many aquatic industries maintenance of waterways and conservation and management of aquatic waterbodies mathematical models that predict the behaviour of flocs rely on the accurate assessments of the size shape density porosity and fractal dimension of flocs these inherently 3 dimensional 3d characteristics are typically derived from 2 dimensional 2d data largely due to the challenges associated with sampling capturing imaging and quantifying these fragile aggregates we have developed new volumetric microscopy techniques which can quantify 3d internal and external structures and characteristics of sediment flocs here these techniques were applied to quantify the 3d size volume shape and fractal dimension of natural and artificial sediment flocs and compare them to standard 2d approaches our study demonstrates that 2d approaches are under estimating shape complexity and over estimating the size and mass settling flux of flocs by up to two orders of magnitude and the discrepancy between 2d and 3d is most marked for natural organic rich macroflocs our study has significant implications for estimations of sediment flux at local to global scales within in aquatic environments these new data and approaches offer the potential to improve the current parameterisation of sediment transport models and to improve the accuracy of current field monitoring techniques graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords density porosity fractal dimension cohesive shape 1 introduction natural sediment flocs are fragile highly heterogeneous aggregates of minerogenic and biogenic material with fluid filled pore space burd and jackson 2009 droppo 2001 and can represent the main component of suspended particulate matter spm in both natural and engineered aquatic systems where sediment supply is dominated by fine grained cohesive and mixed sediments mehta 2013 whitehouse et al 2000 spm transport is critical to the fate and flux of sediment manning and dyer 2007 prandle et al 2005 spearman et al 2020 carbon nutrients contaminants ye et al 2021 and pathogens through all aquatic environments therefore characterising flocs and predicting their dynamic behaviour is essential for the sustainable management of waterways ports and harbours fisheries and marine industries spearman et al 2020 winterwerp et al 2006 floc behaviour is dependant upon the size shape fractal dimension density and porosity of floc aggregates and such data are critical input parameters for the mathematical models that predict fine sediment transport and flocculation dukhovskoy et al 2021 mehta et al 2014 sheremet et al 2017 these characteristics are challenging to measure because flocs are fragile and difficult to sample without altering their structure many et al 2019 and range in size from colloidal particles nanometres to larger aggregates 1000s microns spanning multiple measurement and observation techniques these characteristics are nearly always measured in 2 dimensions 2d floc size considered to be the most important parameter to determine settling velocity and is determined as the spherical or elliptical diameter of a 2d projection from video image or laser analysis winterwerp 1998 floc shape is commonly measured as simple 2d height to width ratios or shape parameters based on regression analysis whilst some sediment transport models use characteristic shapes based on fractal mathematics lee et al 2011 moruzzi et al 2020 williams et al 2008 winterwerp 1998 and fractal dimension a proxy for floc complexity is also usually derived in 2d smoczyński et al 2016 with a fractal dimension of 1 indicating near spherical flocs with larger values up to 3 indicative of looser more complex flocs in addition porosity and density which can influence settling behaviour through buoyancy and drag as fluid flows through the floc moruzzi et al 2020 can only be estimated indirectly from settling velocity and assuming spherical shape therefore these inherently 3 dimensional 3d characteristics are only ever measured or estimated from 2d simplifications spencer et al 2021 recently new volumetric microscopy techniques have been developed and validated which can image and quantify 3d internal and external structures characteristics and composition of sediment flocs with minimal disturbance spencer et al 2021 wheatland et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 these operate across nano to micro scales and therefore have the potential to quantify all meaningful floc characteristics including size shape fractal dimension porosity and density spencer et al 2021 in addition we have developed techniques to capture and stabilise natural sediment flocs whilst preserving these delicate 3d structures wheatland et al 2017 the overall aim of this study was to quantify for the first time the detailed 3d geometry and structures of sediment flocs using x ray microtomography microct our objectives were to quantify the 3d size shape and fractal dimension of artificial and natural sediment flocs and compare these new quantitative 3d data to measurements derived using 2d image analysis techniques in a settling column we then considered the application of these new 3d data streams to improve the accuracy and current application of 2d data with respects to 3d measurements and to improve our understanding and prediction of floc behaviour in the aquatic environment 2 methodology 2 1 general methodological approach in order to compare the geometric structure and physical characteristics of flocs in both 2d and 3d we modified the laboratory spectral flocculation characteristics settling column and floc camera system labsfloc fig 1 manning et al 2017 manning and dyer 2002 floc images were captured as floc populations settled past the camera system to obtain 2d data an agarose filled plankton chamber was fitted to the bottom of the labsfloc column to capture and immobilise settled flocs for analysis of 3d data by microct thus whilst it is not possible to match 2d and 3d measurements for individual flocs we are sampling the same floc population in both 2d and 3d once the flocs had settled the water within the labsfloc column was drained and the plankton chamber capped with a glass coverslip the water within the plankton chamber was then exchanged with a saline solution 35 psu containing low melting point electrophoresis grade agarose at 0 75 plankton chambers were stored at 4 c for 30 min to enable the agarose to solidify these agarose discs contained 1000 s of individual flocs and were placed in sample holders and mounted on the microct stage for scanning and analysis of 3d geometry flocs are very fragile and it is possible that sampling and processing may deform or modify their physical chemical and biological characteristics the agarose prevented any physical chemical or biological interactions between the flocs including minimising deformation during settling and sedimentation droppo et al 1996 whilst the numbers of flocs collected were low enough not to overwhelm to the plankton chamber our methodological approach for capturing stabilising and imaging fragile flocs in 3d is outlined in detail in wheatland et al 2017 2020 and spencer et al 2021 and successfully stabilised and preserved floc structures observations at the nanoscale 3d tomography demonstrated minimal shrinkage deformation and or alteration to 3d structure wheatland et al 2017 to optimise comparability between the 2d and 3d datasets the resolution of microct scans voxel size 10 µm was matched as closely as possible that of the labsfloc imagery pixel size 6 7 µm time requirements associated with data capture and computational processing mean that settling runs were not routinely replicated however in this study total sample number n is very large up to 10 000 s of flocs and our focus was to compare the relative 2d and 3d characteristics of floc populations rather than to quantify the characteristics of a floc population with given composition and physicochemical water column conditions 2 2 floc populations cohesive sediments were flocculated in a mini annular flume in artificial seawater at 35 psu and a suspended particulate matter spm concentration of 1 5 g l 1 to examine wide ranging and contrasting floc sizes and shapes four floc populations were considered three artificial flocs comprising bentonite clay and increasing concentrations of xanthan gum proxy for organic matter at 0 01 2 and 5 and a natural estuarine cohesive sediment sampled from the thames estuary se england silty clay organic matter 15 based on loss on ignition flocs were extracted from the annular flume following 11 days suspension using a wide mouthed pipette to avoid floc breakage manning and dyer 2002 and transferred to the modified labsfloc settling column 2 3 acquisition of 2d datasets 2d floc characteristic datasets including size projected area and diameter and shape aspect ratio circularity were collected by recording floc images in the labsfloc using a high definition camera manning and dyer 2002 ye et al 2020 and processed using trainable weka arganda carreras et al 2017 and trackmate tinevez et al 2017 packages within imagej 2 4 acquisition of 3d datasets a detailed description of the use of microct to acquire and quantify 3d volumetric floc datasets is provided in wheatland et al 2020 microct scans were performed using a nikon metrology xt h 225 tokyo japan micro tomograph this scanner was configured with a 25 225 kv 0 2000 µa x ray source with tungsten reflection target capable of generating polychromatic x rays focal spot size c 3 μm and a perkin elmer waltham massachusetts usa 16 bit flat panel detector scan parameters were set to optimise contrast and resolution voltage 150 kv current 160 μa acquisition time between projections 2829 ms with 2 frame averaging maintaining the same scan parameters for all x ray datasets ensured that their greyscale values and hence feature identification would be comparable the greyscale values of the resulting raw projections represented differences in x ray energy attenuation related to material density and the attenuation coefficient of the materials being imaged the x ray microct generated 2d projections of the sample that were reconstructed to generate 3d cubic data volumes for visualisation and quantification the reconstruction of x ray microct datasets was conducted using ctpro 3d nikon tokyo japan each scan generated 1609 raw x ray projections yielding reconstructed volumes with dimensions of 2048 2048 2048 voxels with a voxel size of 10 µm during reconstruction imaging artefacts e g beam hardening caused by the differential attenuation of x rays through materials of differing density and thickness ketcham and carlson 2001 were addressed by the application of specific algorithms 2 5 segmentation and quantification of 2d and 3d data the quantification of both 2d and 3d data required material segmentation i e the classification of material phases based on greyscale values and or shape cnudde and boone 2013 segmentation of the datasets generated binary images of each component bulk phase which was achieved in fiji imagej via using the semi automated segmentation tool trainable weka segmentation tws v2 1 0 capable of machine learning arganda carreras et al 2017 resulting binary volumes of each bulk phase were then quantified using the 2d particle analyzer and 3d roi manager plugins ollion et al 2013 in fiji imagej which provided quantitative measurements of material properties e g size shape and greyscale intensities in the literature flocs are frequently considered to be spherical objects due to the challenges of measuring their complex shapes and the ease of estimating their settling velocity by applying stokes law khelifa and hill 2006 many et al 2019 moruzzi et al 2020 our approach allows the quantification of the size of a complex 3d object floc volume and this was compared to standard approaches to assess floc size using equivalent spherical diameter esd the perimeter diameter d perim surface equivalent diameter d surf circumscribing diameter d circum and the feret diameter d feret definitions are provided in supporting information table s1 shape was described using aspect ratio e g height to width ratios 2d and 3d circularity 2d and sphericity 3d to measure the fractal dimension of the flocs from the voxel pixel images we used the sphere circle packing method similar to the box counting method here circles were used to cover the area of the floc in 2d and spheres were used to cover the volume of the floc in 3d 3 results data from artificial and natural sediment flocs were combined to provide a dataset with wide ranging floc characteristics and to compare relative 2d and 3d geometry the number of flocs captured observed and quantified varied considerably in total our dataset comprised observations for 22 744 flocs in 2d i e images captured as they passed through the field of view for the labsfloc camera however as a large number of these flocs settled outside the plankton chamber and were not captured for analysis by microct a smaller population sub set of 7974 flocs was quantified in 3d 3 1 2 dimensional floc data the particle size distribution measured as floc area is given in fig 2 a and ranged from 40 µm2 to 6 105 µm2 this is a direct measurement of floc size based on occupied pixels converted to a geometric scale micron and shows a broadly bi modal distribution with two population peaks and a median floc area of 889 µm2 to comply with conventions for measuring floc size and enable comparison between 2d and 3d data we created floc size distributions using equivalent spherical diameter esd the perimeter diameter d perim surface equivalent diameter d surf circumscribing diameter d circum and the feret diameter d feret fig 3 all approaches show a broadly bi modal floc size distribution this aligns to previous in situ and laboratory observations of flocs indicating the presence of c 10 µm diameter flocs comprising flocculi and or primary particles fettweis et al 2012 shen et al 2018 spencer et al 2021 and a larger floc population between c 10 µm and 1000 µm diameter this also appears a good representation of our samples comprising small compact low om bentonite flocs through to large organic rich natural estuarine sediment flocs the modal size of the smaller secondary population may not be observed due to our analytical detection limits and data filtering and therefore the number of smaller flocs with diameter 10 µm are almost certainly under represented some authors observe further separations of these larger 10 µm floc populations e g manning and schoellhamer 2013 observed separate floc populations with diameters 160 µm microflocs and 160 µm macroflocs but such distributions were not seen here and may indicate the dominance of smaller artificial flocs in our population the esd was in the same order of magnitude for all approaches used although d50 was greatest for d circum d feret d perim d surf anova f 3 90 972 278 p 2 2 10 16 and ranged from 34 43 μm while d max showed much greater variation ranging from 941 1814 μm d perim d circum d feret d surf shape is also frequently used to characterise floc populations as it may be indicative of floc composition with organic rich flocs having elongate stringer shapes and shape influences settling velocity and drag moruzzi et al 2020 individual flocs exhibited aspect ratios ranging from 1 0 to 9 1 median 1 3 and circularity ranging from 0 09 to 1 median 1 both measures indicate that the floc population is very strongly dominated by near spherical flocs again confirming the presence of small compact flocs predominantly from our artificial floc populations the majority of flocs had a fractal dimension between 1 5 and 2 in 2d ranging from 1 02 to 2 25 with a median of 1 76 indicative of our compact simple artificial flocs and stringer type natural sediment flocs 3 2 2 dimensional floc data macroflocs larger flocs here defined as those with d 160 µm e g manning and schoelhammer 2013 have been analysed separately from the total floc population as they tend to have more complex shapes and contribute significantly to mass settling flux manning and dyer 2007 soulsby et al 2013 the choice of approach for estimating esd results in varying proportions of macroflocs table 1 macroflocs contribute between 1 9 d surf to 3 6 d circum of the total population but between 40 and 50 of the total area occupied by the floc population i e viewed and measured as projected areas in 2d as expected macroflocs have less spherical shapes with median h l c 1 6 and median circularity c 0 5 showing little variation between the esd characterisation methods used observations indicate that macroflocs are notably more variable in shape and more elongate indicative of larger probably more organic rich flocs in our natural floc population 3 3 3 dimensional floc data the use of volumetric tomography enables quantification of floc size measured as occupied volume and the floc volume distribution is shown in fig 2b this again shows a broadly bimodal distribution but now the smallest floc population volume 1000 µm3 is much more dominant although it may still be under represented due to detection limitations floc volumes ranged from 1000 µm3 i e one voxel to 1 9 107 µm3 with a median floc volume of 12 996 µm3 esd was derived using the same approaches as the 2d data to enable comparison fig 4 floc esd is in the same order of magnitude for all approaches but there were significant differences in floc size anova f 4 31 892 150 6 p 2 10 16 between the different calculation methods where d50 ranges between 29 and 37 μm dperim dcircum dferet dsurf and dmax ranged from 330 to 840 µm dcircum dferet dperim dsurf the most striking difference is the relative dominance of the smaller floc population in the floc size distributions fig 4a d and the bimodal distribution is far less pronounced when measured using dferet adapting the approaches used in 2d esd was then used to estimate equivalent spherical volume esv and compared to the measured floc volumes occupied voxels generated by microct analysis table 2 there is a statistically significant over estimation of volume when d perim d circum and d feret are used anova f 4 39 865 74 35 p 2 10 16 followed by post hoc tukey test with the estimated median floc size doubled d perim and maximum floc size increased by up to an order of magnitude compared with the measured flocs compared to measurements in 2d 3d floc shape measured as sphericity 3d equivalent of circularity was less variable and far less spherical ranging from 0 26 to 0 73 with a median value of 0 57 whilst aspect ratios varied from 1 to 3 5 indicative of much more elongate flocs the majority of the flocs have a fractal dimension between 2 5 and 3 in 3d with a median of 2 7 suggesting more complexity than the 2d measures 3 4 3 dimensional floc data macroflocs as for the 2d data larger flocs 160 µm diameter were analysed separately the method for estimating esd has far greater consequence on the estimation of macrofloc contribution to the floc population when derived from volume for example table 3 demonstrates that macroflocs contribute between 1 and 5 of the total number of flocs but between 27 and 66 of the total volume occupied by flocculated material the shape of the macroflocs is again more complex and more elongate with macrofloc sphericity ranging from 0 26 to 0 63 with most macroflocs having sphericity 0 5 4 discussion 4 1 floc size distribution to enable statistical comparisons both 2d and 3d data were filtered to account for differences in the limit of detection hence particles 32 pixels 404 µm2 labsfloc 900 µm2 micro ct in 2d and 33 voxels 27 000 µm3 micro ct in 3d were excluded from the analysis this means that for both populations the smallest flocs are not represented in the datasets but the lower limit of detection across 2d and 3d data are broadly comparable measuring floc size as diameter has been a key parameter in the assessment monitoring and prediction of cohesive and mixed sediment behaviour as floc size is considered the most important control on settling velocity and hence fine and cohesive sediment dynamics williams et al 2008 in this study we were able to directly quantify floc size from 2d projections and quantification of occupied pixels area as the floc population settled past the labsfloc camera and in 3d as a measure of occupied volume this is in contrast with most commonly applied techniques in the field e g laser in situ scattering and transmissometry lisst in situ settling velocity instrument inssev and laboratory e g floc camera image analysis that derive floc size data from 2d projections and use ellipse fitting to estimate esd the most significant contrast between the two approaches is in the distribution of floc size the distribution of floc area shows a clear bimodal distribution and this is confirmed when observing the distribution of floc size using all four different measures of esd the bi modal distribution becomes most pronounced when using the feret diameter as a measure of esd which is the most widely applied approach the feret diameter is a statistical measure of diameter and is considered a valid estimate of floc size if sufficient measurements are made as is the case here with 20 000 floc measurements as this accounts for any orientation of flocs as they settle jarvis et al 2005 however this bi modal distribution becomes significantly less apparent when accurate measurements of floc size as volume are presented fig 2b and the distribution seen here is more of a size continuum which is then dominated by the smallest class size of flocs 10 µm diameter these observations are in contrast to the frequent reports of distinct multi modal distributions of floc size derived from 2d data these floc size distributions underpin 3d transport modelling of cohesive and mixed sediments by assigning variable fractal dimensions such observed multi modal floc size distributions are caused by mixing of different sized particles and aggregates particularly in coastal and estuarine settings lee et al 2012 and are attributed to different mechanisms of floc aggregation vahedi and gorczyca 2014 with two e g mikkelsen et al 2006 three shen et al 2018 and four lee et al 2012 levels of aggregation observed such levels of aggregation represent small compact highly spherical primary particles and highly stable microflocs or flocculi which are dominated by electroflocculation and larger more complex floc aggregates where bioflocculation and polymer bridging become increasingly important fettweis et al 2012 lee et al 2012 maggi 2007 these multiple levels of floc aggregation or floc hierarchy are based on observations of multi modal floc size distributions derived from 2d data and are used to assign variable fractal dimension and represent flocculation processes using multiple class population balance equations pbe shen et al 2018 however our 3d data particularly for flocs 10 µm diameter demonstrate a continuum of floc size this is supported by spencer et al 2021 who confirm that floc hierarchy is better defined by structure function relationships rather than observations of geometric floc size distributions with key flocculation mechanisms operating across the floc size distribution this suggests that multi modal floc size distributions observed in 2d may be largely an artefact of how 2d size is measured rather than an accurate reflection of floc size modes with potential implications for the efficacy of predictive cohesive sediment transport models that use assigned variable fractal dimensions 4 2 quantifying floc size and shape floc size is generally reported assuming spherical elliptical shape either as equivalent spherical diameter esd or e g the sauter mean diameter an equivalent volume surface area ratio used in in situ measurements using lisst sensors filippa et al 2011 it is recognised that these are 2d measurements and may not capture the true floc morphology here it is clear that floc size derived from 2d data whether as counts of projected 2d area or using multiple methods for the estimation of esd is over estimated with respect to measurement of floc size volume quantified in 3d these differences are modest and statistical measures to explore the population e g median are within the same order of magnitude however these differences become very significant when considering the largest flocs dmax and these over estimations are most pronounced when using measures such as the perimeter or circumference equivalent spherical diameter which take into account the projected floc outline and are hence influenced by floc shape and complexity this suggests that these over estimations are likely due to the significant simplification of floc shape and become more pronounced when considering the larger macrofloc populations 160 µm diameter which contain our natural organic rich flocculated estuarine sediments the measures for floc shape are simplistic and we are restricted to aspect ratio the ratio of smallest to longest diameter which considers how elongate the floc is and circularity sphericity relationship between the floc perimeter and area volume which roughly describes how irregular the shapes are relative to a simple circle or sphere 3d measurements indicate that flocs are far more elongate and irregular in shape compared to 2d measurements recent 3d imagery of natural estuarine sediment flocs confirms the complexity and shape irregularity of natural sediment flocs and the influence of biological populations on floc shape spencer et al 2021 wheatland et al 2020 2017 therefore measures of floc size in controlled laboratory experiments using simple minerogenic sediments are likely to provide good estimations of floc size but this becomes increasingly unreliable for natural organic rich sediments the over estimation of floc size in 2d has been previously recognised particularly where flocs become preferentially orientated during settling presenting the longest axis to the floc camera jarvis et al 2005 however the over simplification of floc shape in 2d may have additional consequences firstly over estimation of size is more significant for the largest flocs which have more complex and elongate shapes and this may result in the artificial creation of a bimodal floc distribution where larger flocs become over represented in the floc population this is confirmed by a more continuous size distribution when size is quantified from 3d data secondly estimations of floc size from 2d projections and estimates of esd will result in a significant amount of empty space surrounding the floc being attributed to the floc with significant consequences for the estimations of floc density and porosity which are typically derived from settling velocity and assumptions of spherical shape utilising stokes law 4 3 consequences for understanding and predicting the dynamics of cohesive and mixed sediments floc size diameter is considered to be the most important floc parameter influencing settling velocity droppo 2001 fennessy et al 1994 gibbs 1985 li and ganczarczyk 1987 however shape porosity and density also have an impact with shape affecting drag density having an influence on the force driving settling velocity and porosity through affecting internal friction as water moves through the floc body li and ganczarczyk 1988 wu and lee 1998 these 3d data suggest that we are currently under estimating or inadequately representing floc shape and or irregularity this results in over estimation of floc size by up to an order of magnitude for large organic rich natural sediment flocs and means that we are probably over estimating floc porosity by including empty space surrounding irregular shaped flocs and thus by default underestimating floc density the frequently observed relationships between increasing floc size and decreasing density increasing porosity fennessy et al 1994 gibbs 1985 have dictated the application of fractal mathematics to account for floc variability in cohesive sediment transport modelling yet these data suggest that our estimations of density and porosity are better explained by increasing floc complexity and shape irregularity with size particularly for natural sediments and this may confirm some observations of the relationships between floc density and shape choi et al 2018 in addition there is increasing evidence that floc shape both variability and complexity has a significant impact on settling velocity although floc shape is rarely measured choi et al 2018 many et al 2019 these new data now provide the opportunity to develop algorithms that significantly improve the characterisation and quantification of floc shape parameters as well as direct quantification of floc size and porosity over estimating floc size may have significant consequences for estimation of the flux of sediment carbon nutrients and pollutants through the aquatic environment to explore the potential impact on mass settling flux we used average floc effective density values for microfloc d 160 µm 200 kg m 3 and macrofloc d 160 µm 50 kg m 3 fractions from 207 data sets i e individual floc populations from the tamar uk gironde france and dollard netherlands estuaries manning and dyer 2007 suspended sediment concentrations between 5 mg l 1 and 8600 mg l 1 then using both floc volume quantified in 3d and estimated from the 2d feret esd we estimated floc mass considering median floc size there is no significant difference in the data suggesting that for the majority of our simple compact near spherical artificial flocs that the use of 2d data makes little difference to estimations of mass settling flux this is expected as near spherical flocs are approximately rotationally symmetric thus a 2d projection contains comparable information to the full 3d geometry however for the largest flocs the use of 2d data over estimates floc mass by up to 1 order of magnitude for the microfloc populations and two orders of magnitude for the macrofloc populations whilst these calculations are approximations they are indicative of the substantial errors that may be propagated by modelling approaches that rely on 2d floc size particularly where natural sediments are forming large eps rich organic flocs with complex and or elongate shapes the imaging and data processing approaches used here are operator and computer processor intensive therefore at present our approach is unlikely to be adapted for application as part of e g a field monitoring campaign without significant modification however the coupled 2d 3d methodological approach allows accurate quantification of the errors associated with 2d measurements and enables geometric measures of 3d floc structure size shape porosity density to be related to measures of floc dynamics such as settling velocity and flocculation rates the possibility of translating 2d data to 3d predictions via simple relations was explored and a power law relation with an exponent slightly larger than 2 was found y 0 702 x2 394 whilst it is not yet clear whether this result is universal for all flocs with varying composition the use of a simple power law relationship between 2d and 3d data provides an approach whereby current field based techniques such as lisst can provide significantly more realistic measures of the complex structures and characteristics of natural heterogeneous sediment flocs 5 conclusions x ray microtomography offers the opportunity to quantify the 3d structure and physical properties of artificial and natural sediment flocs including volumetric size floc size distribution and shape across a range of scales from a few to 1000s microns new 3d data indicate that bi and multi modal floc size distributions which are typically used to assign variable fractal dimensions may be an artefact of 2d simplification of complex 3d shapes new 3d data demonstrate a level of complexity and irregularity in floc shape characteristics that cannot be accounted for in 2d shape descriptors this indicates that porosity may also be over estimated for flocs measuring floc size assuming spherical or elliptical shapes from 2d projections over estimates the size of individual flocs and the mass of flocculated material by up to two orders of magnitude this is most pertinent for natural large highly organic flocs and has consequences for estimations of the flux of
