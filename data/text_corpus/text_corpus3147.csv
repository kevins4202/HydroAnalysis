is a promising method to prevent pharmaceuticals from being discharged into the environment here we evaluate the importance of electro generated oxidants and direct anodic oxidation for degradation of four pharmaceutical cyclophosphamide cp carbamazepine cbz sulfamethoxazole smx and ibuprofen ibp accounting for the scavenging effect of urine constituents using boron doped diamond bdd and iro2 electrodes allyl alcohol and tert butanol were used as selective quenchers for adsorbed and dissolved radicals respectively in electrolyte containing only chloride and pharmaceuticals we found that cbz and smx are primarily oxidized by electro generated cl2 in the fluid boundary layer and cp and ibp are primarily oxidized by physisorbed oh or chemisorbed chlorine iro3 cl regarding the effects of other fresh urine constituents urea creatinine and uric acid quench the dissolved reactive chlorine species cl cl2 hocl cl2 etc however so4 2 shows no effect on pharmaceutical degradation while h2po4 and citrate ions quench iro3 cl resulting in a mixed kinetic and mass transfer limiting oxidation of pharmaceuticals on iro2 citrate ions only quench the dissolved oxidants surface adsorbed radicals are the dominant oxidants leading to the pharmaceutical degradation limited by the mass transfer of pharmaceutical to bdd surface this work provides an understanding of the significance of various pathways for pharmaceutical degradation scavenging effect of urine constituents and strategies for rapid pharmaceutical degradation in human urine graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords eaops electrolysis of fresh human urine electro generated dissolved cl2 degradation pathways of pharmaceuticals scavenging effect of individual urine constituents strategies for faster degradation 1 introduction yearly pharmaceutical spending in the united states is 1 376 per capita in 2019 and 45 7 of americans take at least one prescription drug per month nationalcenterforhealthstatistics 2021 a large portion of these drugs are excreted unchanged or as active metabolites via human urine and feces and join municipal wastewater streams escher et al 2006 lienert et al 2007a lienert et al 2007b most of these compounds are not removed or sufficiently deactivated in wastewater treatment facilities wwtfs these pharmaceuticals eventually end up being discharged into the environment threatening aquatic ecosystems luo et al 2014 and returning to human drinking water supplies benotti et al 2009 numerous studies have reported the detection of pharmaceuticals in drinking water benotti et al 2009 groundwater meador et al 2016 surface water hughes et al 2013 and wastewater zhang and li 2011 from ng l to μg l concentrations the environmental problem is significant and continues to grow due to the proliferation of new pharmaceuticals and consumption the removal of pharmaceuticals can be achieved by implementing physical or chemical treatment technologies such as advanced oxidation filtration coupled with reverse osmosis miralles cuevas et al 2017 sorption on activated carbons etc polloni silva et al 2017 however without stricter regulation from government agencies e g the environmental protection agency in the u s wwtfs rarely install these advanced treatments therefore treatment of pharmaceuticals at the source is particularly important to reduce pharmaceutical discharge into aquatic environments and from entering the potable water supply chaplin 2019 one of the dominant routes for human elimination of pharmaceuticals is via urine wienkers and heath 2005 and most excreted compounds retain key pharmacological properties of their parent compounds daniel 1995 furthermore human urine accounts for less than 1 of domestic wastewater by volume wilsenach et al 2007 but contains up to 6 orders of magnitude higher pharmaceutical concentration winker et al 2008a winker et al 2008b thus it is essential to significantly reduce the pharmaceutical occurrence in the environment by developing efficient technologies to treat human urine various advanced oxidation processes aops for wastewater treatment have been widely developed in the degradation of organic micropollutants in wastewater stream including fenton process fenton 1894 photocatalysis mendez arriaga et al 2008 uv h2o2 keen and linden 2013 however research regarding the pharmaceutical degradation in fresh human urine is quite limited few studies focus on the impacts of the unique urine matrix on aops for the destruction of pharmaceuticals in human urine electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops have growing importance due to their promising versatility environmental compatibility and cost effectiveness in the oxidation of organic pollutants hori 2008 the efficiency of eaops are determined by multiple factors such as the surface chemistry of different electrode materials comninellis et al 2008 electrolyte compositions radjenovic and sedlak 2015 mass transfer rates zollig et al 2017 electrode surface to electrolyte volume ratio clark et al 2021 and applied currents potentials cotillas et al 2018 regarding electrode materials iro2 has strong surface interaction with oh and subsequent formation of chemisorbed oxygen on the surface i e iro2 1 comninellis et al 2008 however it results in a decreased capability for the oxidation of recalcitrant organic compounds in electrolyte only containing cl iro2 1 oxidizes cl to form chemisorbed chlorine iro3 cl via direct electron transfer volmer step beitz et al 1998 and then undergoes herovsky table s2 eq 1 and or tafel steps table s2 eq 2 to generate cl2 followed by a fast hydrolysis to form hocl in solution by contrast boron doped diamond bdd has weak surface interaction with oh this results in electro generation of physisorbed oh e0 oh h h2o 2 32 v at ph 7 which is a much stronger oxidant than hocl e0 hocl cl 1 30 v at ph 7 thus bdd is better able to degrade more recalcitrant pharmaceutical species ironically for the eaops iro2 is often referred to as an active electrode while bdd is referred to as an inactive electrode this jargon survives from research aimed at increasing the rate of chlorine gas evolution for industrial chlorine production human urine is a complex matrix that is very different from wastewater post secondary treatment and drinking water where eaops have been successfully applied radjenovic and sedlak 2015 the high cl content of urine creates opportunity for electrogenerated reactive chlorine species but it also creates the possibility of forming chlorate and perchlorate at the anode jasper et al 2017 organic compounds e g urea creatinine and uric acid in fresh urine compete with pharmaceuticals for the electro generated oxidants during electrolysis this has some benefits for the electrolysis of fresh urine where urea scavenges the reactive chlorine species but not oh and decreases the formation of chlorate and perchlorate clark et al 2021 additionally so4 2 h2po4 and citrate ions have the potential to scavenge oh and or cl and generate new oxidants such as so4 h2po4 and citrate radicals despite some research focusing on the applicability of eaops for pharmaceutical destruction in full synthetic fresh urine matrixes fum clark et al 2021 jojoa sierra et al 2017 few studies have been conducted to understand the effect of electrode materials and individual urine components on the kinetics and pathways of pharmaceutical degradation in this study we focus on the electrolysis of fresh urine instead of hydrolyzed urine because that we demonstrate that the pharmaceuticals are degraded faster but with lower generation of clo3 and clo4 in fum than that in various hydrolyzed urine matrixes in our previous work clark et al 2021 additionally we have conducted the electrolysis of cp and smx in real human urine as a reality check in our previous work clark et al 2021 in this work we reveal the significance of specific electrogenerated oxidants oh iro2 1 cl cl2 cl2 hocl and iro3 cl by using selective radical quenchers during the electrochemical degradation of pharmaceuticals in partial synthetic fresh urine matrixes i e chloride only solution see section 3 1 the experiments were also conducted in different combinations of synthetic fresh urine constituents with bdd and iro2 to evaluate the scavenging effect of individual constituent see section 3 2 3 3 the limiting mechanisms of pharmaceutical degradation i e mass transfer and or kinetically limited are evaluated in each matrix we assess the performance of representative active electrodes iro2 and inactive electrodes bdd for pharmaceutical oxidation in fum see section 3 4 furthermore we evaluate the strategies for achieving faster rates of pharmaceutical degradation in fum see section 3 5 the observed pseudo first order rate constants were obtained and reported along with geometry normalized rate constants accounting for the electrode

specified detailed electrochemical methods are provided in text s2 2 1 3 analytical methods the concentrations of pharmaceuticals were quantified by an hp agilent 1100 high performance liquid chromatography system coupled with a bruker esquire lc ion trap mass spectrometer detailed hplc ms methods are provided in text s3 2 2 mass transfer limiting pseudo first order rate constants the electrolysis rate of pharmaceuticals is typically reported as a pseudo first order rate constant kobs which is the multiplicative product of a second order rate constant for the reaction of the pharmaceutical with all the oxidants and the concentration of oxidants zollig et al 2017 pseudo first order kinetics can be justified since 1 the direct anodic oxidation and oxidation by reactive chlorine species rcs or reactive oxygen species ros on the surface are all first order with respect to pharmaceutical concentration and 2 the concentrations of oxidants in solution phase are assumed to be constant with time steady state generation and consumption and at much lower concentration than the pharmaceutical using pseudo first order kinetics significantly simplifies a complex coupled reaction and mass transport system the pseudo first order rate constant captures the rate of pharmaceutical degradation due to the electrode surface chemistry the applied potential the electrolyte composition and the fluid mechanics in the reactor the role of the fluid mechanics i e km and reactor geometry i e a v are significant barriers to universally using observed pseudo first order rate constants obtained in laboratory experiments since the rate constants may not be accurate for other reactor geometries and flow situations in this work we compare the kobs with the mass transfer limited pseudo first order rate constant km in our experiment setup to understand the limiting mechanisms of oxidation km was determined by the limiting current technique with different mass transfer conditions text s5 bard and faulkner 2001 the corresponding mass transfer coefficient was determined to be 0 130 0 0028 cm min which corresponds to a pseudo first order rate constant of 0 028 min 1 for the electrochemical cell used in this work a v 0 214 cm 1 if kobs km it indicates that the rate of pharmaceutical degradation is limited by transport of pharmaceutical molecules to the anode surface where reactions occur via direct anodic oxidation surface adsorbed radicals and dissolved oxidants in the vicinity of electrode surface before diffusing into the stagnant layer fig s2 gradient b if kobs km oxidants generated at the anode desorb and react homogeneously with the pharmaceuticals fig s2 gradient c and d by contrast if kobs km the pharmaceutical degradation has some kinetic limitations along with the mass transfer resistance fig s2 gradient a text s7 for detailed discussion zollig et al 2017 2 3 using selective radical quenchers to reveal the dominant degradation pathways allyl alcohol aa ch2 chch2oh was used to quench both surface adsorbed radicals e g cl ads and ohads and dissolved radicals e g cl cl2 and oh in the solution phase barazesh et al 2016 due to 1 its strong interaction with the anode surface via its п orbitals celdran and gonzalez velasco 1981 and 2 its high reactivity with radicals k oh aa 5 9 109 m 1s 1 maruthamuthu 1980 kcl aa 6 108 m 1s 1 barazesh et al 2016 fig 1 a r3 r5 as shown in fig 1b c the electro generation of fc species were completely inhibited due to aa quenching adsorbed and dissolved oh and cl cl2 along with iro3 cl and iro2 1 therefore the only degradation pathway available to pharmaceuticals is det in the presence of excess aa by contrast tert butanol t buoh has been found to not readily react with surface adsorbed radical species barazesh et al 2016 brainard and madix 1989 however t buoh can still effectively quench dissolved radicals in the solution phase e g dissolved cl cl2 and oh given the large homogeneous second order rate constants k oh t buoh 4 8 108 m 1s 1 kcl t buoh 3 108 m 1s 1 fig 1a r1 r2 mertens and von sonntag 1995 motohashi and saito 1993 the formation of fc with iro2 anodes was not quenched by t buoh fig 1c but it was quenched with bdd fig 1b this is consistent with that fc is generated via surface absorbed chlorine iro3 cl with iro2 but it is formed via dissolved chlorine radicals which are quenched by t buoh cho and hoffmann 2014 consequently the degradation of pharmaceuticals is ascribed to det and reaction with surface adsorbed radicals with excess t buoh 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrochemical oxidation pathways of pharmaceuticals in chloride only solution to reveal the scavenging effects of each constituent in the urine matrix it is important to first determine the electrochemical oxidation pathways of pharmaceutical in cl only solution the possible pathways are direct electron transfer det and reaction with electro generated oxidants including physisorbed and dissolved oh free chlorine fc primarily hocl and ocl and to a lesser extent cl2 and or cl2o at ph 6 chemisorbed chlorine iro3 cl and chlorine radicals cl ads cl cl2 panizza and cerisola 2009 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 however few studies have evaluated the proportion of these oxidation pathways of pharmaceutical removal in the cl only electrolyte at ph 6 the mechanistic studies of various classes of pharmaceuticals degradation were conducted to gain insight into the role of various degradation pathways during electrolysis the contribution of each oxidation pathway was determined by the electrolysis rates of pharmaceuticals in various electrolytes containing excess quenchers table s4 the individual contribution of each of the following oxidation pathway was evaluated by copi ki kobs cl where copi is the contribution of oxidation pathway i ki is the rate constant of oxidation pathway via i and kobs cl is the kobs in 100 mm cl electrolyte therefore 1 the rate constant of direct electron transfer det was the electrolysis rate in electrolyte containing cl and aa 2 the rate constant of oxidation via ohdiss was determined as the difference between electrolysis rates in clo4 an inert supporting electrolyte that yields no anodic reactive chlorine species and clo4 t buoh 3 oxidation due to ohads iro2 1 was determined as the difference between the rate constant in clo4 and the rate constants of det and ohdiss obtained from 1 and 2 respectively 4 the rate constant of oxidation via cl ads with bdd was determined as the difference between rate constants due to clo4 t buoh and cl t buoh 5 oxidation due to dissolved cl cl2 and fc with bdd was determined as the difference between observed rate constants in cl and cl t buoh with elimination of rate constants of ohdiss obtained from 2 and 6 the rate constant of oxidation via fc and iro3 cl were distinguished by mass transfer limiting mechanism see below 3 1 1 rate of degradation due to direct electron transfer det the contribution of det to pharmaceutical oxidation was evaluated by comparing rate constants in cl solution with and without excess aa as shown in fig 2 green vs orange columns the substantial difference between the electrolysis rates of pharmaceuticals indicates that the contribution of det accounts for less than 3 for the degradation of cp cbz and smx with both electrodes the contribution from det to pharmaceutical oxidation was calculated and are shown in table 1 the degradation of pharmaceutical via det on both electrodes was mainly kinetically limited k km where k is the true kinetic rate constant of pharmaceutical oxidation this suggests a significant kinetic barrier for direct electron transfer from pharmaceuticals to the anode the observed rate constants of smx degradation are higher than other three pharmaceuticals indicating the faster degradation of smx via det 3 1 2 rate of degradation due to ohdiss the difference between the electrolysis rates of pharmaceuticals in 100 mm clo4 with and without t buoh indicates the contribution of ohdiss to the pharmaceutical degradation fig 2 grey vs pink columns ohdiss contributes 23 4 9 3 3 9 and 15 1 to the degradation of cp cbz smx and ibp with bdd respectively table 1 however the electrolysis rates of pharmaceutical with iro2 are unaltered with the addition of t buoh it suggests that ohdiss barely contributes to the pharmaceutical degradation with iro2 consistent with previous reports of low ohdiss production for active anodes barazesh et al 2016 jasper et al 2016 furthermore the electrolysis rates of pharmaceuticals are at mass transfer limiting rates on bdd with the addition of t buoh consistent with that t buoh does not readily react with surface adsorbed radical species see above fig 1a r1 r2 3 1 3 rate of degradation due to adsorbed oh and chemisorbed oxygen iro2 1 the kinds of surface adsorbed oh are varied due to the anode materials comninellis 1994 physisorbed oh is generated on bdd while chemisorbed oxygen is formed on iro2 surface iro2 1 the significance of ohads and iro2 1 for pharmaceutical degradation in cl only electrolyte was evaluated by the difference among the electrolysis rates of pharmaceuticals in clo4 kobs kdet k ohads k ohdiss clo4 t buoh kobs kdet k ohads and cl aa kobs kdet fig 2 green vs pink vs orange columns the ohads is the dominant oxidant for the electrolysis of cp 71 6 and ibp 61 0 with bdd table 1 however iro2 1 is not the dominant oxidant for the oxidation of cp and ibp due to the less reactivity of iro2 1 as compared to ohads furthermore only less than 8 of the electrolysis of cbz and smx is ascribed to ohads or iro2 1 with both electrodes due to their favored chlorine mediated pathways see below the degradation of pharmaceuticals with iro2 in the absence of cl is at rates lower than mass transfer limiting rates this implies that the pharmaceutical degradation has some kinetic limitations k km due to the formation of chemisorbed oxygen on iro2 3 1 4 rate of degradation due to iro3 cl dissolved cl cl2 and free chlorine fc with iro2 the electrolysis rates of all pharmaceuticals were unaltered with excess t buoh present in cl solution with iro2 fig 1b it suggests little contribution of dissolved cl cl2 to the pharmaceutical degradation with iro2 table 1 this is consistent with previous literature that it has not yet been reported for iro2 to generate significant amount of dissolved cl cl2 to affect the pharmaceutical degradation barazesh et al 2016 cho and hoffmann 2014 jasper et al 2016 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 chemisorbed chlorine iro3 cl and or fc are the dominant oxidants for the degradation of pharmaceuticals table 1 the generation of fc is via chemisorbed chlorine iro3 cl evidenced by the observation that the generation of fc is unaltered in the presence of excess t buoh during electrolysis fig 1c therefore the addition of t buoh cannot separate the individual importance of iro3 cl and fc the difference between the electrolysis rates of pharmaceuticals in clo4 t buoh and cl t buoh is ascribed to the essential contribution of both iro3 cl and fc to the pharmaceutical degradation fig 2b pink vs blue columns however the heterogeneous reactions of pharmaceuticals via direct anodic oxidation and with surface adsorbed oxidants have a maximum pseudo first order rate constant km 0 028 min 1 when the oxidation kinetics are faster than the rate of transport of pharmaceutical to the anode surface from the bulk solution this results in a clear distinction between the contribution from surface adsorbed oxidants iro3 cl and the solution phase oxidants fc taken all together the iro3 cl is the dominant oxidant for the oxidation of cp 78 0 and ibp 76 0 while its contribution to the degradation of cbz 4 6 and smx 2 9 is small table 1 by contrast the contribution of fc to cp and ibp degradation is negligible 0 with iro2 consistent with that cp and ibp have been found to be recalcitrant to fc clark et al 2021 weng et al 2014 the electrolysis rates of cbz and smx in cl solution are much higher than km fig 2b suggesting a substantial contribution of the homogenous reaction enhancement to their degradation fig s2 gradient c or d cbz reacts with hocl at very slow rates k 10 4 m 1s 1 as compared to smx k 1 1 103 m 1s 1 dodd and huang 2004 but reacts with cl2 and cl2o at very fast rates k 104 m 1s 1 soufan et al 2013 furthermore an equilibrium of hocl with cl2 and cl2o can be established due to the electro generation of cl2 and hocl and ph the speciation of fc with respect to the ph is shown in fig s3b and the local ph at the anode surface is approximately 0 74 text s6 at which the dominant fc species is dissolved cl2 although the proportion of cl2 decreases due to the increasing ph away from the anode surface fig s3b the role of dissolved cl2 is not negligible in the stagnant layer thus the primary degradation pathways of cbz in cl only solution is via dissolved cl2 which has not been reported or known for pharmaceutical degradation during electrolysis barazesh et al 2016 jasper et al 2016 although the reactivity of cl2 with smx has not been reported the cl2 is assumed to react with smx at similar rates as with cbz due to the presence of alkene in their molecular structures table s12 besides the presumed oxidation of smx by dissolved cl2 hocl could contribute significantly to the smx degradation due to 1 increasing proportion of hocl in fc species away from the anode fig s3 and 2 similar reactivity of hocl with smx as cl2 taken all together fc primarily hocl and or cl2 is the dominant oxidant for the degradation of cbz 91 7 and smx 92 1 in electrolyte containing only cl 3 1 5 rate of degradation due to cl ads dissolved cl2 and free chlorine fc with bdd several studies have reported that cl reacts with most organic molecules at similar rates as oh buxton et al 1988 jasper et al 2016 however electro generated cl is known as physisorbed radical but rapidly combine with local cl or cl to generate cl2 or dissolved cl2 in the stagnant layer respectively gligorovski et al 2015 the experimental results showed that the contribution of cl ads to all pharmaceutical degradation with bdd is negligible 0 when compares the kobs between clo4 t buoh and cl t buoh fig 2a pink vs blue columns the electrolysis rates of organic compounds in cl solutions have been correlated to reaction rates with dissolved cl and cl2 previously barazesh et al 2016 cho and hoffmann 2014 yang et al 2016 this indicates that cl cl2 e0 cl 2 41 v e0 cl2 2 09 v beitz et al 1998 neta et al 1988 contributes to the transformation of organic contaminants at cl concentrations of human urine 100 mm cl2 is expected to be the dominant species of chlorine radical generated with bdd electrodes text s4 furthermore the generation pathway of fc with bdd is via dissolved cl2 hence t buoh not only quenches cl2 but also prevents the formation of fc fig 1b therefore the significance of dissolved cl2 and fc were evaluated in group for the pharmaceutical degradation unfortunately the method of distinguishing iro3 cl and fc discussed above for iro2 is not valid for bdd since both dissolved cl2 and fc are present in solution phase as noted above cl2 is the dominant oxidant for the oxidation of cbz while both cl2 and hocl are the dominant oxidants for the oxidation of smx the kobs of cbz and smx in cl solution with bdd much above km was observed it suggests that cl2 diss and cl2 are the dominant oxidants for the degradation of cbz 81 4 while cl2 diss and hocl cl2 are the dominant oxidants for the degradation of smx 93 2 table 1 based on the observation above the oxidation pathways of pharmaceuticals with alkene functional groups present in cbz and smx but not in cp and ibp table s12 are primarily via reactions with cl2 or hocl with both active and inactive electrodes during electrolysis in electrolyte only containing cl this is consistent with the well known rapid reactions of alkenes with halogens li et al 2020 by contrast the pharmaceuticals which are sluggish towards fc are oxidized mainly via surface adsorbed oxidants oh or chemisorbed chlorine therefore further experiments were undertaken to understand the scavenging effect of urine constituents on pharmaceutical degradation based upon the understanding of dominant degradation pathways for each pharmaceutical 3 2 the scavenging effect of organic urine constituents on pharmaceutical degradation the synthetic fresh urine matrixes contain significant organic constituents including urea 270 mm creatinine 13 mm and uric acid 3 mm and inorganic constituents such as sulfate so4 2 15 mm dihydrogen phosphate h2po4 20 mm and citrate ions 3 mm the oxidant scavenging effects of these compounds may dramatically alter the rates of pharmaceutical degradation the scavenging effect of each constituent is shown below 3 2 1 urea urea 270 mm is the most abundant organic compound present in fresh human urine the electrolysis rates of smx and cbz in the simplified synthetic fresh urine matrixes sum 270 mm urea 100 mm cl were significantly decreased as compared to that in cl solution with both iro2 and bdd anodes fig 3 a b green vs orange columns this suggests the large quenching effect of urea on dissolved reactive chlorine species rcs cl2 hocl cl2 and etc urea reacts with hocl with a rate constant of kurea hocl 0 63 m 1s 1 deborde and von gunten 2008 while the rate constant of hocl with smx is 3 orders of magnitude higher than with urea the rest of the pharmaceuticals investigated react slower with hocl than urea eslamian 2016 james a et al 2020 moreover the reactivity of dissolved cl2 with urea is similar to that with cbz and smx kcl2 urea 2 35 104 m 1s 1 blatchley iii and cheng 2010 therefore the oxidation of pharmaceutical via fc are suppressed due to the high urea content in sum the reactivities of dissolved cl2 with urea and pharmaceuticals have not yet been reported however the rate constants of cl2 with most organic molecules are 107 m 1s 1 neta et al 1988 therefore cl2 likely has similar reactivity towards urea and pharmaceutical with rate constants of 107 m 1s 1 thus cl2 is also quenched by urea that for the pharmaceutical degradation with bdd due to the high concentration of urea the addition of urea has little impact on the electrolysis rates of cp and ibp with bdd fig 3a green vs orange columns due to that 1 the oh is the dominant oxidant for the degradation of cp and ibp table 1 oh can selectively oxidize pharmaceutical due to the unusual slow reaction of oh with urea clark et al 2021 and 3 contribution of rcs to their degradation is negligible see above even dissolved rcs are quenched by urea the reactivity of oh with urea k 7 9 105 m 1s 1 is much lower than with most pharmaceuticals k 1010 m 1s 1 zwiener and frimmel 2000 which creates an effective selectivity of oh towards pharmaceutical degradation the electrolysis rates of cp and ibp were unaltered with iro2 in the presence of urea fig 3b green vs orange columns although iro3 cl the dominant oxidant for the oxidation of cp and ibp as one of the rcs is presumed to be quenched by urea this is likely due to that 1 the degradation of cp and ibp is already mass transfer limited reacting with iro3 cl occurring at the anode surface and 2 the electro generation of iro3 cl is sufficient to degrade cp and ibp albeit urea also reacts with iro3 cl 3 2 2 creatinine creatinine 13 mm is a waste product of muscle metabolism and is present in human urine as shown in fig 3a b cyan vs orange columns the electrolysis rates of cp and ibp were not substantially changed in the presence of creatinine with both electrodes it is because the radical quenching effect of creatinine is similar to that of urea cotillas et al 2018 although the rate constants of oh with creatinine have not been reported hence oh can selectively oxidize pharmaceuticals with the addition of creatinine to sum however the electrolysis rates of cbz were further decreased when creatinine is added to sum likely due to the larger scavenging effect of creatinine on dissolved cl2 although the reaction rates of cl2 with creatinine is unknown the second order rate constant of cl2 and creatinine is speculated to be 106 m 1s 1 it is because cl2 has been found to react with dimethenamid at 1 21 106 m 1s 1 via chlorination of the alkene group sivey et al 2010 and creatinine has alkene functional group analogous to dimethenamid thus dissolved cl2 is further quenched with the addition of creatinine 13 mm to sum consistent with the experimental data by contrast the rates of smx degradation were not changed with both electrodes this suggests the contribution of cl2 to smx is insignificant and hocl is not further quenched by creatinine consistent with the rate constant of hocl with creatinine khocl creatinine 0 25 m 1s 1 tachikawa et al 2005 similar to that with urea kurea hocl 0 63 m 1s 1 deborde and von gunten 2008 3 2 3 uric acid the normal excretion of uric acid in human urine is 1 06 3 1 mm in this work 3 mm uric acid was used to maximize the worst case of scenario of oxidants scavenging effect as shown in fig 3a b violet vs orange columns the addition of uric acid to sum resulted in a decrease of electrolysis rates of cbz to km due to a significant hocl and cl2 quenching effect of uric acid the uric acid scavenges hocl with an estimated rate constant 3 105 m 1s 1 squadrito et al 2010 additionally uric acid has an alkene group analogous to dimethenamid so that it likely reacts with cl2 at 106 m 1s 1 see above discussion for creatinine the rates of smx degradation were decreased but slightly above km fig 3a b violet columns the reaction of smx is mass transfer limited with very low homogenous reaction enhancement due to the reaction competition between uric acid and smx with hocl moreover the degradation rates of cp and ibp were decreased to mass transfer limiting rates due to the ohdiss quenching effect of uric acid in solution phase with bdd fig 3a uric acid is reported to react with oh at near diffusion controlled rate k oh uric acid 7 2 109 m 1s 1 masuda et al 1975 it results in the competition between uric acid and pharmaceuticals for oh in the solution phase furthermore the oxidation of cp and ibp is also observed at mass transfer limiting rates with iro2 fig 3b it s possibly due to that 1 the reaction of ohabs on bdd and iro3 cl on iro2 with uric acid is mass transfer limited and 2 the ohabs and iro3 cl are sufficient to react with pharmaceuticals and maintain pharmaceutical concentration at zero on the surface the organic constituents urea creatinine and uric acid in synthetic fresh urine substantially quench the dissolved rcs it results in a significant decrease of electrolysis rates of cbz and smx with both electrodes urea and creatinine do not effectively change the electrolysis rates of cp and ibp due to the selectivity of oh towards pharmaceutical oxidation by contrast uric acid quenching all dissolved radicals results in the oxidation of cp and ibp limited by the mass transfer of pharmaceuticals to the anode surface 3 3 the effect of inorganic urine constituents on pharmaceutical degradation 3 3 1 so4 2 so4 2 15 mm is an abundant anion in synthetic fresh urine matrixes the addition of so4 2 can produce new oxidants so4 and s2o8 2 table s2 eqs 5 7 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 so4 is an intermediate and responsible for the formation of s2o8 2 but many studies have suggested its participation in the oxidation of organics bagastyo et al 2013 costa et al 2009 murugananthan et al 2011 song et al 2018 additionally s2o8 2 is a less reactive oxidant than so4 104 m 1s 1 davies et al 1984 the electrolysis rates of all pharmaceuticals were unchanged with the addition so4 2 to sum due to the similar reactivity of so4 product of quenching oh and cl by so4 2 as oh and cl fig 3c d gray vs orange columns the reactivities of so4 with most pharmaceuticals have been reported to be greater than 108 m 1s 1 mcaskill and sangster 1979 merga et al 1994 padmaja et al 1992 and the reactivity of urea with so4 is similar to that with oh kso4 urea 6 35 105 m 1s 1 zhang et al 2015 thus so4 should have a selectivity towards pharmaceutical oxidation analogous to oh nonetheless the electrolysis rates of cbz and smx were hypothesized to decrease with the addition of so4 2 due to the cl quenching effect of so4 2 that inhibits the formation of fc table s2 eq 9 however this process is suppressed due to high content of cl in the matrixes table s2 eq 10 3 3 2 h2po4 h2po4 20 mm may affect electrolysis rates of pharmaceuticals due to the generation of h2po4 table s2 eqs 11 12 grabner et al 1973 maruthamuthu and neta 1978 however the electrolysis rates of pharmaceuticals were unchanged in the presence of h2po4 with bdd fig 3c blue column this is likely due to that 1 the reaction rate constant of oh with h2po4 k 2 0 104 m 1s 1 is 5 to 6 orders of magnitude lower than that with cp and ibp k 109 10 m 1s 1 and 2 h2po4 does not likely scavenge cl because of the high reactivity of h2po4 with cl k 2 2 106 m 1s 1 and the high concentration of cl however the addition of h2po4 decreased electrolysis rates of cp cbz and ibp below km with iro2 fig 3d blue column this is unexpected because the electro generation of h2po4 via direct anodic oxidation is supposed to facilitate production of more rcs table s2 eq 12 we hypothesize that the diminished rates of the degradation of cp cbz and ibp suggest that the iro3 cl is quenched by h2po4 with the generation of less reactive oxidant h2po4 albeit the reactivity of iro3 cl with h2po4 is unclear it results in a mixed kinetically and mass transfer limiting degradation of pharmaceuticals with iro2 however the rates of smx degradation were decreased but still above km with both electrodes it suggests that 1 the kinetic between h2po4 iro3 cl scavenging product and smx is faster than the mass transport and 2 the homogenous reaction of hocl with smx despite the diminished generation of hocl due to the hypothesized iro3 cl scavenging effect of h2po4 3 3 3 citrate ions sodium citrate 3 mm is a derivative of citric acid in urine matrixes its radical scavenging effect k oh citrate ion 2 4 108 m 1s 1 table s2 eqs 13 14 zepp et al 1992 changes the oxidation rates of the pharmaceuticals due to the low reactivity of citrate radicals radical scavenging product with organic contaminants e0 na3citrate 0 18 v van hoonacker and englebienne 2006 the reaction rate constant of cl2 with citrate ions has not been reported previously as a reference 1 standard reduction potential of chlorine radicals e0 cl2 cl 2 24 v armstrong et al 2013 is close to that of oh at ph 6 e0 oh oh 2 38 v armstrong et al 2013 and 2 cl2 reacts with most organics at rates 107 m 1s 1 buxton et al 2000 thus these suggest that the reactivity of cl2 and citrate ion is possibly around 107 m 1s 1 as shown in fig 3c green vs orange columns the electrolysis rates of cp and ibp decreased to km on bdd with the addition of citrate ions consistent with the presumable radical scavenging effect of citrate ions the rates of cp and ibp degradation were decreased below km with iro2 fig 3d green vs orange columns it suggests the degradation of cp and ibp is controlled by mass transfer as well as kinetic rates with iro2 due to the iro3 cl quenching effect by citrate ions in analogues to h2po4 furthermore the oxidation rates of cbz and smx were decreased with the addition of citrate ions with both electrodes fig 3c d specifically the observed electrolysis rate of cbz is down to km while it is still above km for smx degradation with bdd the oxidation rates are observed below and near km for cbz and smx oxidation with iro2 respectively taken together these observations suggest 1 citrate ions slightly quench cl2 resulting in less fc formation with bdd 2 iro3 cl is largely quenched by citrate resulting in a mixed kinetic and mass transfer limit of reaction of cbz with iro2 3 the homogeneous reaction of hocl with smx adds up to the electrolysis rates consistent with the reactivity of hocl with citrate k 5 5 10 3 m 1s 1 tsamba et al 2020 lower than with smx k 1 1 103 m 1s 1 dodd and huang 2004 and 4 the cl2 is quenched by citrate significantly leading to no homogeneous reaction enhancement for cbz degradation with both electrodes although the reactivity has not been reported table s2 eq 16 3 4 electrolysis of pharmaceutical in full synthetic fresh urine matrixes fum the scavenging effects of individual urine constituents were further consolidated and verified by experiments conducted in the full synthetic fresh urine matrixes fum the electrolysis of fum with relatively low current densities 10 ma cm2 did not significantly change the ph of the electrolyte all pharmaceuticals were degraded greater than 90 within 1 5 hr treatment with bdd fig 4 a while they were eliminated greater than 80 with iro2 fig 4b in addition the observed and normalized pseudo first order rate constants were obtained to assess the performance of pharmaceuticals degradation in fum fig 4c similar rapid degradation rates of cp cbz and ibp were observed corresponding to km with bdd electrode this suggests the pharmaceutical degradation in fum takes place at mass transfer limiting conditions consistent with the dissolved oxidant scavenging effect of citrate and uric acid by contrast the electrolysis rates of cp cbz and ibp were substantially lower than km with iro2 it suggests a mixed kinetic and mass transfer limit of pharmaceutical degradation consistent with the scavenging effect of h2po4 and citrate discussed above while the smx is degraded the fastest among all pharmaceuticals at rates slightly above km by both electrodes the high reactivity of smx with hocl in solution phase leads to the electrolysis rates greater than or near the km in our electrochemical setup the concentration of pharmaceuticals can be removed by 3 orders of magnitude within 9 hr treatment on iro2 electrodes normalized kobs greater than 0 075 cm min fig s4 bdd outperformed iro2 with normalized kobs 0 124 cm min for all pharmaceuticals this results in presumable 3 orders of magnitude reduction in concentration within 6 hours fig s4 the discrepancy between the electrolysis rates of pharmaceuticals with both anodes is as expected and reported previously due to the kinds and yields of oxidants generated on bdd and iro2 electrodes see above kapałka et al 2011 li et al 2015 moreira et al 2017 3 5 strategies of faster pharmaceutical degradation by active and inactive anodes to investigate the best strategies for achieving faster degradation of pharmaceuticals with both active and inactive anodes multiple approaches were tested such as increasing mass transfer rates increasing the applied current densities and increasing the initial chloride concentration 3 5 1 increasing mass transfer rates the observed rate constants of pharmaceutical degradation are determined by the mass transfer limiting rate km and the true kinetic rate constant of pharmaceutical degradation k when oxidation only occurs at the anode surface fig s2 gradient a and b given by k o b s 1 1 k 1 k m text s7 therefore increasing km should result in the increase of kobs theoretically it agrees with the observation shown in fig 5 a b increasing the mass transfer rates leads to higher oxidation rates of pharmaceuticals with both electrodes although the electrolysis rates are below their corresponding km re 11050 it suggests the oxidation of pharmaceuticals at re 11050 is both kinetically and mass transfer limited for our experimental setup additionally the pseudo first order true kinetic rate constants k of each pharmaceutical with bdd and iro2 can be determined in our electrochemical setup measured potential 2 5v the k reflects the kinetics of pharmaceutical oxidation on the electrode surface controlled only by the applied potential regardless of electrochemical cell geometry and mass transfer conditions as shown in table s11 the k is higher for all pharmaceuticals with bdd than iro2 consistent with the presumed h2po4 and citrate ion quenching effect on iro3 cl with iro2 see above furthermore the k is highest for the oxidation of smx with both electrodes due to the faster degradation of smx via det 3 5 2 increasing current densities as shown in fig 5c d increasing current densities equivalent to increasing the applied potential increases the generation rates of oxidants and facilitates the direct electron transfer the electrolysis rates of pharmaceuticals with 100 ma cm2 were significantly higher than the determined km at re 2977 cotillas cotillas et al 2018 ascribed the similar observation to the twice generation of oxidants in solution phase due to the higher current densities in cl only solution however it is doubtful due to the oxidant scavenging effect of urine constituents as noted above the plausible explanation is that a 1 order of magnitude increase in applied current density leads to significantly more gas evolution and thus increases km during electrolysis which further increases the observed oxidation rates of pharmaceuticals it explains why the electrolysis rates of pharmaceuticals are higher than km re 2977 with 100 ma cm2 applied current densities the degradation rate of smx is much higher than the other pharmaceuticals it is likely due to the higher rates for smx degradation via det see above 3 5 3 increasing the concentration of chloride ions the electrolysis rates of pharmaceuticals were unchanged with the addition of 400 mm cl to fum fig 5c d the stoichiometric excess of cl as compared to urea did not effectively accelerate the degradation of pharmaceuticals it suggests that 1 the generation of dissolved rcs is not rapid enough to reach the chlorination breakpoint and 2 the electro generation of iro3 cl is not sufficient to outweigh the quenching effect of h2po4 and citrate ions increasing the mass transfer rates is important for faster degradation of pharmaceuticals in fum for both active and inactive types of electrodes however the electrolysis rates of pharmaceuticals with inactive type anode e g bdd outcompete that with active type anode e g iro2 due to the higher kinetic rates achieved by inactive anode in our experimental setup nonetheless for eaops with low km i e much smaller than k on iro2 the oxidation of organic contaminants with iro2 could occur at mass transfer controlled rates in the absence of dissolved oxidants under this circumstance the electrolysis rates could be similar for bdd and iro2 electrodes since the rates are controlled by the mass transfer of organic contaminants from bulk to the electrode surface additionally increasing the applied current densities can result in similar electrolysis rates of pharmaceuticals by bdd and iro2 by enabling the true kinetic rates on iro2 similar to that on bdd however increasing the current densities decreases the faradaic efficiency and costs more energy however it enhances mass transfer rates likely due to the intense gas evolution the stoichiometric excess cl as compared to urea does not impact the oxidation of pharmaceuticals in fum due to that the generation rates of fc are not sufficient to reach chlorination breakpoint 4 conclusion electro generated dissolved cl2 has been overlooked for the oxidation of organic contaminants in previous literature dissolved cl2 is the dominant oxidant for the rapid degradation of cbz while hocl is the dominant oxidant for the oxidation of smx in electrolyte only containing cl by contrast the surface adsorbed oxidants oh or iro3 cl are the dominant oxidants for the degradation of cp and ibp urea creatinine and uric acid significantly quench dissolved rcs in the solution phase this results in a mass transfer limit of pharmaceutical degradation citrate ions and h2po4 possibly quench iro3 cl resulting in a mixed kinetic and mass transfer controlled degradation of pharmaceuticals with iro2 however h2po4 and so4 2 ions do not alter the electrolysis rates of pharmaceuticals that are primarily degraded by oh the degradation of pharmaceuticals in full synthetic fresh urine matrixes fum occurs at mixed kinetic and mass transfer control with iro2 but occurs at mass transfer controlled rates with bdd for our experimental setup increasing the mass transfer rate is particularly important for both types of anodes for faster pharmaceutical degradation in fum the true kinetic rate constants for pharmaceutical oxidation are higher with bdd than with iro2 however for industrial eaops in a flow reactor re 3000 the oxidation of organic contaminants with iro2 could occur at mass transfer controlled rates in the absence of dissolved oxidants bdd is prohibitively expensive and iro2 contains rare earth elements therefore the development of economic stable and environmentally friendly anodes is desirable furthermore future work aimed at designing devices that allows fast mass transfer with minimum byproduct formation could provide significant contribution to mitigating the release organic contaminants into the environment author contributions

is a promising method to prevent pharmaceuticals from being discharged into the environment here we evaluate the importance of electro generated oxidants and direct anodic oxidation for degradation of four pharmaceutical cyclophosphamide cp carbamazepine cbz sulfamethoxazole smx and ibuprofen ibp accounting for the scavenging effect of urine constituents using boron doped diamond bdd and iro2 electrodes allyl alcohol and tert butanol were used as selective quenchers for adsorbed and dissolved radicals respectively in electrolyte containing only chloride and pharmaceuticals we found that cbz and smx are primarily oxidized by electro generated cl2 in the fluid boundary layer and cp and ibp are primarily oxidized by physisorbed oh or chemisorbed chlorine iro3 cl regarding the effects of other fresh urine constituents urea creatinine and uric acid quench the dissolved reactive chlorine species cl cl2 hocl cl2 etc however so4 2 shows no effect on pharmaceutical degradation while h2po4 and citrate ions quench iro3 cl resulting in a mixed kinetic and mass transfer limiting oxidation of pharmaceuticals on iro2 citrate ions only quench the dissolved oxidants surface adsorbed radicals are the dominant oxidants leading to the pharmaceutical degradation limited by the mass transfer of pharmaceutical to bdd surface this work provides an understanding of the significance of various pathways for pharmaceutical degradation scavenging effect of urine constituents and strategies for rapid pharmaceutical degradation in human urine graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords eaops electrolysis of fresh human urine electro generated dissolved cl2 degradation pathways of pharmaceuticals scavenging effect of individual urine constituents strategies for faster degradation 1 introduction yearly pharmaceutical spending in the united states is 1 376 per capita in 2019 and 45 7 of americans take at least one prescription drug per month nationalcenterforhealthstatistics 2021 a large portion of these drugs are excreted unchanged or as active metabolites via human urine and feces and join municipal wastewater streams escher et al 2006 lienert et al 2007a lienert et al 2007b most of these compounds are not removed or sufficiently deactivated in wastewater treatment facilities wwtfs these pharmaceuticals eventually end up being discharged into the environment threatening aquatic ecosystems luo et al 2014 and returning to human drinking water supplies benotti et al 2009 numerous studies have reported the detection of pharmaceuticals in drinking water benotti et al 2009 groundwater meador et al 2016 surface water hughes et al 2013 and wastewater zhang and li 2011 from ng l to μg l concentrations the environmental problem is significant and continues to grow due to the proliferation of new pharmaceuticals and consumption the removal of pharmaceuticals can be achieved by implementing physical or chemical treatment technologies such as advanced oxidation filtration coupled with reverse osmosis miralles cuevas et al 2017 sorption on activated carbons etc polloni silva et al 2017 however without stricter regulation from government agencies e g the environmental protection agency in the u s wwtfs rarely install these advanced treatments therefore treatment of pharmaceuticals at the source is particularly important to reduce pharmaceutical discharge into aquatic environments and from entering the potable water supply chaplin 2019 one of the dominant routes for human elimination of pharmaceuticals is via urine wienkers and heath 2005 and most excreted compounds retain key pharmacological properties of their parent compounds daniel 1995 furthermore human urine accounts for less than 1 of domestic wastewater by volume wilsenach et al 2007 but contains up to 6 orders of magnitude higher pharmaceutical concentration winker et al 2008a winker et al 2008b thus it is essential to significantly reduce the pharmaceutical occurrence in the environment by developing efficient technologies to treat human urine various advanced oxidation processes aops for wastewater treatment have been widely developed in the degradation of organic micropollutants in wastewater stream including fenton process fenton 1894 photocatalysis mendez arriaga et al 2008 uv h2o2 keen and linden 2013 however research regarding the pharmaceutical degradation in fresh human urine is quite limited few studies focus on the impacts of the unique urine matrix on aops for the destruction of pharmaceuticals in human urine electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops have growing importance due to their promising versatility environmental compatibility and cost effectiveness in the oxidation of organic pollutants hori 2008 the efficiency of eaops are determined by multiple factors such as the surface chemistry of different electrode materials comninellis et al 2008 electrolyte compositions radjenovic and sedlak 2015 mass transfer rates zollig et al 2017 electrode surface to electrolyte volume ratio clark et al 2021 and applied currents potentials cotillas et al 2018 regarding electrode materials iro2 has strong surface interaction with oh and subsequent formation of chemisorbed oxygen on the surface i e iro2 1 comninellis et al 2008 however it results in a decreased capability for the oxidation of recalcitrant organic compounds in electrolyte only containing cl iro2 1 oxidizes cl to form chemisorbed chlorine iro3 cl via direct electron transfer volmer step beitz et al 1998 and then undergoes herovsky table s2 eq 1 and or tafel steps table s2 eq 2 to generate cl2 followed by a fast hydrolysis to form hocl in solution by contrast boron doped diamond bdd has weak surface interaction with oh this results in electro generation of physisorbed oh e0 oh h h2o 2 32 v at ph 7 which is a much stronger oxidant than hocl e0 hocl cl 1 30 v at ph 7 thus bdd is better able to degrade more recalcitrant pharmaceutical species ironically for the eaops iro2 is often referred to as an active electrode while bdd is referred to as an inactive electrode this jargon survives from research aimed at increasing the rate of chlorine gas evolution for industrial chlorine production human urine is a complex matrix that is very different from wastewater post secondary treatment and drinking water where eaops have been successfully applied radjenovic and sedlak 2015 the high cl content of urine creates opportunity for electrogenerated reactive chlorine species but it also creates the possibility of forming chlorate and perchlorate at the anode jasper et al 2017 organic compounds e g urea creatinine and uric acid in fresh urine compete with pharmaceuticals for the electro generated oxidants during electrolysis this has some benefits for the electrolysis of fresh urine where urea scavenges the reactive chlorine species but not oh and decreases the formation of chlorate and perchlorate clark et al 2021 additionally so4 2 h2po4 and citrate ions have the potential to scavenge oh and or cl and generate new oxidants such as so4 h2po4 and citrate radicals despite some research focusing on the applicability of eaops for pharmaceutical destruction in full synthetic fresh urine matrixes fum clark et al 2021 jojoa sierra et al 2017 few studies have been conducted to understand the effect of electrode materials and individual urine components on the kinetics and pathways of pharmaceutical degradation in this study we focus on the electrolysis of fresh urine instead of hydrolyzed urine because that we demonstrate that the pharmaceuticals are degraded faster but with lower generation of clo3 and clo4 in fum than that in various hydrolyzed urine matrixes in our previous work clark et al 2021 additionally we have conducted the electrolysis of cp and smx in real human urine as a reality check in our previous work clark et al 2021 in this work we reveal the significance of specific

chromatography system coupled with a bruker esquire lc ion trap mass spectrometer detailed hplc ms methods are provided in text s3 2 2 mass transfer limiting pseudo first order rate constants the electrolysis rate of pharmaceuticals is typically reported as a pseudo first order rate constant kobs which is the multiplicative product of a second order rate constant for the reaction of the pharmaceutical with all the oxidants and the concentration of oxidants zollig et al 2017 pseudo first order kinetics can be justified since 1 the direct anodic oxidation and oxidation by reactive chlorine species rcs or reactive oxygen species ros on the surface are all first order with respect to pharmaceutical concentration and 2 the concentrations of oxidants in solution phase are assumed to be constant with time steady state generation and consumption and at much lower concentration than the pharmaceutical using pseudo first order kinetics significantly simplifies a complex coupled reaction and mass transport system the pseudo first order rate constant captures the rate of pharmaceutical degradation due to the electrode surface chemistry the applied potential the electrolyte composition and the fluid mechanics in the reactor the role of the fluid mechanics i e km and reactor geometry i e a v are significant barriers to universally using observed pseudo first order rate constants obtained in laboratory experiments since the rate constants may not be accurate for other reactor geometries and flow situations in this work we compare the kobs with the mass transfer limited pseudo first order rate constant km in our experiment setup to understand the limiting mechanisms of oxidation km was determined by the limiting current technique with different mass transfer conditions text s5 bard and faulkner 2001 the corresponding mass transfer coefficient was determined to be 0 130 0 0028 cm min which corresponds to a pseudo first order rate constant of 0 028 min 1 for the electrochemical cell used in this work a v 0 214 cm 1 if kobs km it indicates that the rate of pharmaceutical degradation is limited by transport of pharmaceutical molecules to the anode surface where reactions occur via direct anodic oxidation surface adsorbed radicals and dissolved oxidants in the vicinity of electrode surface before diffusing into the stagnant layer fig s2 gradient b if kobs km oxidants generated at the anode desorb and react homogeneously with the pharmaceuticals fig s2 gradient c and d by contrast if kobs km the pharmaceutical degradation has some kinetic limitations along with the mass transfer resistance fig s2 gradient a text s7 for detailed discussion zollig et al 2017 2 3 using selective radical quenchers to reveal the dominant degradation pathways allyl alcohol aa ch2 chch2oh was used to quench both surface adsorbed radicals e g cl ads and ohads and dissolved radicals e g cl cl2 and oh in the solution phase barazesh et al 2016 due to 1 its strong interaction with the anode surface via its п orbitals celdran and gonzalez velasco 1981 and 2 its high reactivity with radicals k oh aa 5 9 109 m 1s 1 maruthamuthu 1980 kcl aa 6 108 m 1s 1 barazesh et al 2016 fig 1 a r3 r5 as shown in fig 1b c the electro generation of fc species were completely inhibited due to aa quenching adsorbed and dissolved oh and cl cl2 along with iro3 cl and iro2 1 therefore the only degradation pathway available to pharmaceuticals is det in the presence of excess aa by contrast tert butanol t buoh has been found to not readily react with surface adsorbed radical species barazesh et al 2016 brainard and madix 1989 however t buoh can still effectively quench dissolved radicals in the solution phase e g dissolved cl cl2 and oh given the large homogeneous second order rate constants k oh t buoh 4 8 108 m 1s 1 kcl t buoh 3 108 m 1s 1 fig 1a r1 r2 mertens and von sonntag 1995 motohashi and saito 1993 the formation of fc with iro2 anodes was not quenched by t buoh fig 1c but it was quenched with bdd fig 1b this is consistent with that fc is generated via surface absorbed chlorine iro3 cl with iro2 but it is formed via dissolved chlorine radicals which are quenched by t buoh cho and hoffmann 2014 consequently the degradation of pharmaceuticals is ascribed to det and reaction with surface adsorbed radicals with excess t buoh 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrochemical oxidation pathways of pharmaceuticals in chloride only solution to reveal the scavenging effects of each constituent in the urine matrix it is important to first determine the electrochemical oxidation pathways of pharmaceutical in cl only solution the possible pathways are direct electron transfer det and reaction with electro generated oxidants including physisorbed and dissolved oh free chlorine fc primarily hocl and ocl and to a lesser extent cl2 and or cl2o at ph 6 chemisorbed chlorine iro3 cl and chlorine radicals cl ads cl cl2 panizza and cerisola 2009 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 however few studies have evaluated the proportion of these oxidation pathways of pharmaceutical removal in the cl only electrolyte at ph 6 the mechanistic studies of various classes of pharmaceuticals degradation were conducted to gain insight into the role of various degradation pathways during electrolysis the contribution of each oxidation pathway was determined by the electrolysis rates of pharmaceuticals in various electrolytes containing excess quenchers table s4 the individual contribution of each of the following oxidation pathway was evaluated by copi ki kobs cl where copi is the contribution of oxidation pathway i ki is the rate constant of oxidation pathway via i and kobs cl is the kobs in 100 mm cl electrolyte therefore 1 the rate constant of direct electron transfer det was the electrolysis rate in electrolyte containing cl and aa 2 the rate constant of oxidation via ohdiss was determined as the difference between electrolysis rates in clo4 an inert supporting electrolyte that yields no anodic reactive chlorine species and clo4 t buoh 3 oxidation due to ohads iro2 1 was determined as the difference between the rate constant in clo4 and the rate constants of det and ohdiss obtained from 1 and 2 respectively 4 the rate constant of oxidation via cl ads with bdd was determined as the difference between rate constants due to clo4 t buoh and cl t buoh 5 oxidation due to dissolved cl cl2 and fc with bdd was determined as the difference between observed rate constants in cl and cl t buoh with elimination of rate constants of ohdiss obtained from 2 and 6 the rate constant of oxidation via fc and iro3 cl were distinguished by mass transfer limiting mechanism see below 3 1 1 rate of degradation due to direct electron transfer det the contribution of det to pharmaceutical oxidation was evaluated by comparing rate constants in cl solution with and without excess aa as shown in fig 2 green vs orange columns the substantial difference between the electrolysis rates of pharmaceuticals indicates that the contribution of det accounts for less than 3 for the degradation of cp cbz and smx with both electrodes the contribution from det to pharmaceutical oxidation was calculated and are shown in table 1 the degradation of pharmaceutical via det on both electrodes was mainly kinetically limited k km where k is the true kinetic rate constant of pharmaceutical oxidation this suggests a significant kinetic barrier for direct electron transfer from pharmaceuticals to the anode the observed rate constants of smx degradation are higher than other three pharmaceuticals indicating the faster degradation of smx via det 3 1 2 rate of degradation due to ohdiss the difference between the electrolysis rates of pharmaceuticals in 100 mm clo4 with and without t buoh indicates the contribution of ohdiss to the pharmaceutical degradation fig 2 grey vs pink columns ohdiss contributes 23 4 9 3 3 9 and 15 1 to the degradation of cp cbz smx and ibp with bdd respectively table 1 however the electrolysis rates of pharmaceutical with iro2 are unaltered with the addition of t buoh it suggests that ohdiss barely contributes to the pharmaceutical degradation with iro2 consistent with previous reports of low ohdiss production for active anodes barazesh et al 2016 jasper et al 2016 furthermore the electrolysis rates of pharmaceuticals are at mass transfer limiting rates on bdd with the addition of t buoh consistent with that t buoh does not readily react with surface adsorbed radical species see above fig 1a r1 r2 3 1 3 rate of degradation due to adsorbed oh and chemisorbed oxygen iro2 1 the kinds of surface adsorbed oh are varied due to the anode materials comninellis 1994 physisorbed oh is generated on bdd while chemisorbed oxygen is formed on iro2 surface iro2 1 the significance of ohads and iro2 1 for pharmaceutical degradation in cl only electrolyte was evaluated by the difference among the electrolysis rates of pharmaceuticals in clo4 kobs kdet k ohads k ohdiss clo4 t buoh kobs kdet k ohads and cl aa kobs kdet fig 2 green vs pink vs orange columns the ohads is the dominant oxidant for the electrolysis of cp 71 6 and ibp 61 0 with bdd table 1 however iro2 1 is not the dominant oxidant for the oxidation of cp and ibp due to the less reactivity of iro2 1 as compared to ohads furthermore only less than 8 of the electrolysis of cbz and smx is ascribed to ohads or iro2 1 with both electrodes due to their favored chlorine mediated pathways see below the degradation of pharmaceuticals with iro2 in the absence of cl is at rates lower than mass transfer limiting rates this implies that the pharmaceutical degradation has some kinetic limitations k km due to the formation of chemisorbed oxygen on iro2 3 1 4 rate of degradation due to iro3 cl dissolved cl cl2 and free chlorine fc with iro2 the electrolysis rates of all pharmaceuticals were unaltered with excess t buoh present in cl solution with iro2 fig 1b it suggests little contribution of dissolved cl cl2 to the pharmaceutical degradation with iro2 table 1 this is consistent with previous literature that it has not yet been reported for iro2 to generate significant amount of dissolved cl cl2 to affect the pharmaceutical degradation barazesh et al 2016 cho and hoffmann 2014 jasper et al 2016 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 chemisorbed chlorine iro3 cl and or fc are the dominant oxidants for the degradation of pharmaceuticals table 1 the generation of fc is via chemisorbed chlorine iro3 cl evidenced by the observation that the generation of fc is unaltered in the presence of excess t buoh during electrolysis fig 1c therefore the addition of t buoh cannot separate the individual importance of iro3 cl and fc the difference between the electrolysis rates of pharmaceuticals in clo4 t buoh and cl t buoh is ascribed to the essential contribution of both iro3 cl and fc to the pharmaceutical degradation fig 2b pink vs blue columns however the heterogeneous reactions of pharmaceuticals via direct anodic oxidation and with surface adsorbed oxidants have a maximum pseudo first order rate constant km 0 028 min 1 when the oxidation kinetics are faster than the rate of transport of pharmaceutical to the anode surface from the bulk solution this results in a clear distinction between the contribution from surface adsorbed oxidants iro3 cl and the solution phase oxidants fc taken all together the iro3 cl is the dominant oxidant for the oxidation of cp 78 0 and ibp 76 0 while its contribution to the degradation of cbz 4 6 and smx 2 9 is small table 1 by contrast the contribution of fc to cp and ibp degradation is negligible 0 with iro2 consistent with that cp and ibp have been found to be recalcitrant to fc clark et al 2021 weng et al 2014 the electrolysis rates of cbz and smx in cl solution are much higher than km fig 2b suggesting a substantial contribution of the homogenous reaction enhancement to their degradation fig s2 gradient c or d cbz reacts with hocl at very slow rates k 10 4 m 1s 1 as compared to smx k 1 1 103 m 1s 1 dodd and huang 2004 but reacts with cl2 and cl2o at very fast rates k 104 m 1s 1 soufan et al 2013 furthermore an equilibrium of hocl with cl2 and cl2o can be established due to the electro generation of cl2 and hocl and ph the speciation of fc with respect to the ph is shown in fig s3b and the local ph at the anode surface is approximately 0 74 text s6 at which the dominant fc species is dissolved cl2 although the proportion of cl2 decreases due to the increasing ph away from the anode surface fig s3b the role of dissolved cl2 is not negligible in the stagnant layer thus the primary degradation pathways of cbz in cl only solution is via dissolved cl2 which has not been reported or known for pharmaceutical degradation during electrolysis barazesh et al 2016 jasper et al 2016 although the reactivity of cl2 with smx has not been reported the cl2 is assumed to react with smx at similar rates as with cbz due to the presence of alkene in their molecular structures table s12 besides the presumed oxidation of smx by dissolved cl2 hocl could contribute significantly to the smx degradation due to 1 increasing proportion of hocl in fc species away from the anode fig s3 and 2 similar reactivity of hocl with smx as cl2 taken all together fc primarily hocl and or cl2 is the dominant oxidant for the degradation of cbz 91 7 and smx 92 1 in electrolyte containing only cl 3 1 5 rate of degradation due to cl ads dissolved cl2 and free chlorine fc with bdd several studies have reported that cl reacts with most organic molecules at similar rates as oh buxton et al 1988 jasper et al 2016 however electro generated cl is known as physisorbed radical but rapidly combine with local cl or cl to generate cl2 or dissolved cl2 in the stagnant layer respectively gligorovski et al 2015 the experimental results showed that the contribution of cl ads to all pharmaceutical degradation with bdd is negligible 0 when compares the kobs between clo4 t buoh and cl t buoh fig 2a pink vs blue columns the electrolysis rates of organic compounds in cl solutions have been correlated to reaction rates with dissolved cl and cl2 previously barazesh et al 2016 cho and hoffmann 2014 yang et al 2016 this indicates that cl cl2 e0 cl 2 41 v e0 cl2 2 09 v beitz et al 1998 neta et al 1988 contributes to the transformation of organic contaminants at cl concentrations of human urine 100 mm cl2 is expected to be the dominant species of chlorine radical generated with bdd electrodes text s4 furthermore the generation pathway of fc with bdd is via dissolved cl2 hence t buoh not only quenches cl2 but also prevents the formation of fc fig 1b therefore the significance of dissolved cl2 and fc were evaluated in group for the pharmaceutical degradation unfortunately the method of distinguishing iro3 cl and fc discussed above for iro2 is not valid for bdd since both dissolved cl2 and fc are present in solution phase as noted above cl2 is the dominant oxidant for the oxidation of cbz while both cl2 and hocl are the dominant oxidants for the oxidation of smx the kobs of cbz and smx in cl solution with bdd much above km was observed it suggests that cl2 diss and cl2 are the dominant oxidants for the degradation of cbz 81 4 while cl2 diss and hocl cl2 are the dominant oxidants for the degradation of smx 93 2 table 1 based on the observation above the oxidation pathways of pharmaceuticals with alkene functional groups present in cbz and smx but not in cp and ibp table s12 are primarily via reactions with cl2 or hocl with both active and inactive electrodes during electrolysis in electrolyte only containing cl this is consistent with the well known rapid reactions of alkenes with halogens li et al 2020 by contrast the pharmaceuticals which are sluggish towards fc are oxidized mainly via surface adsorbed oxidants oh or chemisorbed chlorine therefore further experiments were undertaken to understand the scavenging effect of urine constituents on pharmaceutical degradation based upon the understanding of dominant degradation pathways for each pharmaceutical 3 2 the scavenging effect of organic urine constituents on pharmaceutical degradation the synthetic fresh urine matrixes contain significant organic constituents including urea 270 mm creatinine 13 mm and uric acid 3 mm and inorganic constituents such as sulfate so4 2 15 mm dihydrogen phosphate h2po4 20 mm and citrate ions 3 mm the oxidant scavenging effects of these compounds may dramatically alter the rates of pharmaceutical degradation the scavenging effect of each constituent is shown below 3 2 1 urea urea 270 mm is the most abundant organic compound present in fresh human urine the electrolysis rates of smx and cbz in the simplified synthetic fresh urine matrixes sum 270 mm urea 100 mm cl were significantly decreased as compared to that in cl solution with both iro2 and bdd anodes fig 3 a b green vs orange columns this suggests the large quenching effect of urea on dissolved reactive chlorine species rcs cl2 hocl cl2 and etc urea reacts with hocl with a rate constant of kurea hocl 0 63 m 1s 1 deborde and von gunten 2008 while the rate constant of hocl with smx is 3 orders of magnitude higher than with urea the rest of the pharmaceuticals investigated react slower with hocl than urea eslamian 2016 james a et al 2020 moreover the reactivity of dissolved cl2 with urea is similar to that with cbz and smx kcl2 urea 2 35 104 m 1s 1 blatchley iii and cheng 2010 therefore the oxidation of pharmaceutical via fc are suppressed due to the high urea content in sum the reactivities of dissolved cl2 with urea and pharmaceuticals have not yet been reported however the rate constants of cl2 with most organic molecules are 107 m 1s 1 neta et al 1988 therefore cl2 likely has similar reactivity towards urea and pharmaceutical with rate constants of 107 m 1s 1 thus cl2 is also quenched by urea that for the pharmaceutical degradation with bdd due to the high concentration of urea the addition of urea has little impact on the electrolysis rates of cp and ibp with bdd fig 3a green vs orange columns due to that 1 the oh is the dominant oxidant for the degradation of cp and ibp table 1 oh can selectively oxidize pharmaceutical due to the unusual slow reaction of oh with urea clark et al 2021 and 3 contribution of rcs to their degradation is negligible see above even dissolved rcs are quenched by urea the reactivity of oh with urea k 7 9 105 m 1s 1 is much lower than with most pharmaceuticals k 1010 m 1s 1 zwiener and frimmel 2000 which creates an effective selectivity of oh towards pharmaceutical degradation the electrolysis rates of cp and ibp were unaltered with iro2 in the presence of urea fig 3b green vs orange columns although iro3 cl the dominant oxidant for the oxidation of cp and ibp as one of the rcs is presumed to be quenched by urea this is likely due to that 1 the degradation of cp and ibp is already mass transfer limited reacting with iro3 cl occurring at the anode surface and 2 the electro generation of iro3 cl is sufficient to degrade cp and ibp albeit urea also reacts with iro3 cl 3 2 2 creatinine creatinine 13 mm is a waste product of muscle metabolism and is present in human urine as shown in fig 3a b cyan vs orange columns the electrolysis rates of cp and ibp were not substantially changed in the presence of creatinine with both electrodes it is because the radical quenching effect of creatinine is similar to that of urea cotillas et al 2018 although the rate constants of oh with creatinine have not been reported hence oh can selectively oxidize pharmaceuticals with the addition of creatinine to sum however the electrolysis rates of cbz were further decreased when creatinine is added to sum likely due to the larger scavenging effect of creatinine on dissolved cl2 although the reaction rates of cl2 with creatinine is unknown the second order rate constant of cl2 and creatinine is speculated to be 106 m 1s 1 it is because cl2 has been found to react with dimethenamid at 1 21 106 m 1s 1 via chlorination of the alkene group sivey et al 2010 and creatinine has alkene functional group analogous to dimethenamid thus dissolved cl2 is further quenched with the addition of creatinine 13 mm to sum consistent with the experimental data by contrast the rates of smx degradation were not changed with both electrodes this suggests the contribution of cl2 to smx is insignificant and hocl is not further quenched by creatinine consistent with the rate constant of hocl with creatinine khocl creatinine 0 25 m 1s 1 tachikawa et al 2005 similar to that with urea kurea hocl 0 63 m 1s 1 deborde and von gunten 2008 3 2 3 uric acid the normal excretion of uric acid in human urine is 1 06 3 1 mm in this work 3 mm uric acid was used to maximize the worst case of scenario of oxidants scavenging effect as shown in fig 3a b violet vs orange columns the addition of uric acid to sum resulted in a decrease of electrolysis rates of cbz to km due to a significant hocl and cl2 quenching effect of uric acid the uric acid scavenges hocl with an estimated rate constant 3 105 m 1s 1 squadrito et al 2010 additionally uric acid has an alkene group analogous to dimethenamid so that it likely reacts with cl2 at 106 m 1s 1 see above discussion for creatinine the rates of smx degradation were decreased but slightly above km fig 3a b violet columns the reaction of smx is mass transfer limited with very low homogenous reaction enhancement due to the reaction competition between uric acid and smx with hocl moreover the degradation rates of cp and ibp were decreased to mass transfer limiting rates due to the ohdiss quenching effect of uric acid in solution phase with bdd fig 3a uric acid is reported to react with oh at near diffusion controlled rate k oh uric acid 7 2 109 m 1s 1 masuda et al 1975 it results in the competition between uric acid and pharmaceuticals for oh in the solution phase furthermore the oxidation of cp and ibp is also observed at mass transfer limiting rates with iro2 fig 3b it s possibly due to that 1 the reaction of ohabs on bdd and iro3 cl on iro2 with uric acid is mass transfer limited and 2 the ohabs and iro3 cl are sufficient to react with pharmaceuticals and maintain pharmaceutical concentration at zero on the surface the organic constituents urea creatinine and uric acid in synthetic fresh urine substantially quench the dissolved rcs it results in a significant decrease of electrolysis rates of cbz and smx with both electrodes urea and creatinine do not effectively change the electrolysis rates of cp and ibp due to the selectivity of oh towards pharmaceutical oxidation by contrast uric acid quenching all dissolved radicals results in the oxidation of cp and ibp limited by the mass transfer of pharmaceuticals to the anode surface 3 3 the effect of inorganic urine constituents on pharmaceutical degradation 3 3 1 so4 2 so4 2 15 mm is an abundant anion in synthetic fresh urine matrixes the addition of so4 2 can produce new oxidants so4 and s2o8 2 table s2 eqs 5 7 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 so4 is an intermediate and responsible for the formation of s2o8 2 but many studies have suggested its participation in the oxidation of organics bagastyo et al 2013 costa et al 2009 murugananthan et al 2011 song et al 2018 additionally s2o8 2 is a less reactive oxidant than so4 104 m 1s 1 davies et al 1984 the electrolysis rates of all pharmaceuticals were unchanged with the addition so4 2 to sum due to the similar reactivity of so4 product of quenching oh and cl by so4 2 as oh and cl fig 3c d gray vs orange columns the reactivities of so4 with most pharmaceuticals have been reported to be greater than 108 m 1s 1 mcaskill and sangster 1979 merga et al 1994 padmaja et al 1992 and the reactivity of urea with so4 is similar to that with oh kso4 urea 6 35 105 m 1s 1 zhang et al 2015 thus so4 should have a selectivity towards pharmaceutical oxidation analogous to oh nonetheless the electrolysis rates of cbz and smx were hypothesized to decrease with the addition of so4 2 due to the cl quenching effect of so4 2 that inhibits the formation of fc table s2 eq 9 however this process is suppressed due to high content of cl in the matrixes table s2 eq 10 3 3 2 h2po4 h2po4 20 mm may affect electrolysis rates of pharmaceuticals due to the generation of h2po4 table s2 eqs 11 12 grabner et al 1973 maruthamuthu and neta 1978 however the electrolysis rates of pharmaceuticals were unchanged in the presence of h2po4 with bdd fig 3c blue column this is likely due to that 1 the reaction rate constant of oh with h2po4 k 2 0 104 m 1s 1 is 5 to 6 orders of magnitude lower than that with cp and ibp k 109 10 m 1s 1 and 2 h2po4 does not likely scavenge cl because of the high reactivity of h2po4 with cl k 2 2 106 m 1s 1 and the high concentration of cl however the addition of h2po4 decreased electrolysis rates of cp cbz and ibp below km with iro2 fig 3d blue column this is unexpected because the electro generation of h2po4 via direct anodic oxidation is supposed to facilitate production of more rcs table s2 eq 12 we hypothesize that the diminished rates of the degradation of cp cbz and ibp suggest that the iro3 cl is quenched by h2po4 with the generation of less reactive oxidant h2po4 albeit the reactivity of iro3 cl with h2po4 is unclear it results in a mixed kinetically and mass transfer limiting degradation of pharmaceuticals with iro2 however the rates of smx degradation were decreased but still above km with both electrodes it suggests that 1 the kinetic between h2po4 iro3 cl scavenging product and smx is faster than the mass transport and 2 the homogenous reaction of hocl with smx despite the diminished generation of hocl due to the hypothesized iro3 cl scavenging effect of h2po4 3 3 3 citrate ions sodium citrate 3 mm is a derivative of citric acid in urine matrixes its radical scavenging effect k oh citrate ion 2 4 108 m 1s 1 table s2 eqs 13 14 zepp et al 1992 changes the oxidation rates of the pharmaceuticals due to the low reactivity of citrate radicals radical scavenging product with organic contaminants e0 na3citrate 0 18 v van hoonacker and englebienne 2006 the reaction rate constant of cl2 with citrate ions has not been reported previously as a reference 1 standard reduction potential of chlorine radicals e0 cl2 cl 2 24 v armstrong et al 2013 is close to that of oh at ph 6 e0 oh oh 2 38 v armstrong et al 2013 and 2 cl2 reacts with most organics at rates 107 m 1s 1 buxton et al 2000 thus these suggest that the reactivity of cl2 and citrate ion is possibly around 107 m 1s 1 as shown in fig 3c green vs orange columns the electrolysis rates of cp and ibp decreased to km on bdd with the addition of citrate ions consistent with the presumable radical scavenging effect of citrate ions the rates of cp and ibp degradation were decreased below km with iro2 fig 3d green vs orange columns it suggests the degradation of cp and ibp is controlled by mass transfer as well as kinetic rates with iro2 due to the iro3 cl quenching effect by citrate ions in analogues to h2po4 furthermore the oxidation rates of cbz and smx were decreased with the addition of citrate ions with both electrodes fig 3c d specifically the observed electrolysis rate of cbz is down to km while it is still above km for smx degradation with bdd the oxidation rates are observed below and near km for cbz and smx oxidation with iro2 respectively taken together these observations suggest 1 citrate ions slightly quench cl2 resulting in less fc formation with bdd 2 iro3 cl is largely quenched by citrate resulting in a mixed kinetic and mass transfer limit of reaction of cbz with iro2 3 the homogeneous reaction of hocl with smx adds up to the electrolysis rates consistent with the reactivity of hocl with citrate k 5 5 10 3 m 1s 1 tsamba et al 2020 lower than with smx k 1 1 103 m 1s 1 dodd and huang 2004 and 4 the cl2 is quenched by citrate significantly leading to no homogeneous reaction enhancement for cbz degradation with both electrodes although the reactivity has not been reported table s2 eq 16 3 4 electrolysis of pharmaceutical in full synthetic fresh urine matrixes fum the scavenging effects of individual urine constituents were further consolidated and verified by experiments conducted in the full synthetic fresh urine matrixes fum the electrolysis of fum with relatively low current densities 10 ma cm2 did not significantly change the ph of the electrolyte all pharmaceuticals were degraded greater than 90 within 1 5 hr treatment with bdd fig 4 a while they were eliminated greater than 80 with iro2 fig 4b in addition the observed and normalized pseudo first order rate constants were obtained to assess the performance of pharmaceuticals degradation in fum fig 4c similar rapid degradation rates of cp cbz and ibp were observed corresponding to km with bdd electrode this suggests the pharmaceutical degradation in fum takes place at mass transfer limiting conditions consistent with the dissolved oxidant scavenging effect of citrate and uric acid by contrast the electrolysis rates of cp cbz and ibp were substantially lower than km with iro2 it suggests a mixed kinetic and mass transfer limit of pharmaceutical degradation consistent with the scavenging effect of h2po4 and citrate discussed above while the smx is degraded the fastest among all pharmaceuticals at rates slightly above km by both electrodes the high reactivity of smx with hocl in solution phase leads to the electrolysis rates greater than or near the km in our electrochemical setup the concentration of pharmaceuticals can be removed by 3 orders of magnitude within 9 hr treatment on iro2 electrodes normalized kobs greater than 0 075 cm min fig s4 bdd outperformed iro2 with normalized kobs 0 124 cm min for all pharmaceuticals this results in presumable 3 orders of magnitude reduction in concentration within 6 hours fig s4 the discrepancy between the electrolysis rates of pharmaceuticals with both anodes is as expected and reported previously due to the kinds and yields of oxidants generated on bdd and iro2 electrodes see above kapałka et al 2011 li et al 2015 moreira et al 2017 3 5 strategies of faster pharmaceutical degradation by active and inactive anodes to investigate the best strategies for achieving faster degradation of pharmaceuticals with both active and inactive anodes multiple approaches were tested such as increasing mass transfer rates increasing the applied current densities and increasing the initial chloride concentration 3 5 1 increasing mass transfer rates the observed rate constants of pharmaceutical degradation are determined by the mass transfer limiting rate km and the true kinetic rate constant of pharmaceutical degradation k when oxidation only occurs at the anode surface fig s2 gradient a and b given by k o b s 1 1 k 1 k m text s7 therefore increasing km should result in the increase of kobs theoretically it agrees with the observation shown in fig 5 a b increasing the mass transfer rates leads to higher oxidation rates of pharmaceuticals with both electrodes although the electrolysis rates are below their corresponding km re 11050 it suggests the oxidation of pharmaceuticals at re 11050 is both kinetically and mass transfer limited for our experimental setup additionally the pseudo first order true kinetic rate constants k of each pharmaceutical with bdd and iro2 can be determined in our electrochemical setup measured potential 2 5v the k reflects the kinetics of pharmaceutical oxidation on the electrode surface controlled only by the applied potential regardless of electrochemical cell geometry and mass transfer conditions as shown in table s11 the k is higher for all pharmaceuticals with bdd than iro2 consistent with the presumed h2po4 and citrate ion quenching effect on iro3 cl with iro2 see above furthermore the k is highest for the oxidation of smx with both electrodes due to the faster degradation of smx via det 3 5 2 increasing current densities as shown in fig 5c d increasing current densities equivalent to increasing the applied potential increases the generation rates of oxidants and facilitates the direct electron transfer the electrolysis rates of pharmaceuticals with 100 ma cm2 were significantly higher than the determined km at re 2977 cotillas cotillas et al 2018 ascribed the similar observation to the twice generation of oxidants in solution phase due to the higher current densities in cl only solution however it is doubtful due to the oxidant scavenging effect of urine constituents as noted above the plausible explanation is that a 1 order of magnitude increase in applied current density leads to significantly more gas evolution and thus increases km during electrolysis which further increases the observed oxidation rates of pharmaceuticals it explains why the electrolysis rates of pharmaceuticals are higher than km re 2977 with 100 ma cm2 applied current densities the degradation rate of smx is much higher than the other pharmaceuticals it is likely due to the higher rates for smx degradation via det see above 3 5 3 increasing the concentration of chloride ions the electrolysis rates of pharmaceuticals were unchanged with the addition of 400 mm cl to fum fig 5c d the stoichiometric excess of cl as compared to urea did not effectively accelerate the degradation of pharmaceuticals it suggests that 1 the generation of dissolved rcs is not rapid enough to reach the chlorination breakpoint and 2 the electro generation of iro3 cl is not sufficient to outweigh the quenching effect of h2po4 and citrate ions increasing the mass transfer rates is important for faster degradation of pharmaceuticals in fum for both active and inactive types of electrodes however the electrolysis rates of pharmaceuticals with inactive type anode e g bdd outcompete that with active type anode e g iro2 due to the higher kinetic rates achieved by inactive anode in our experimental setup nonetheless for eaops with low km i e much smaller than k on iro2 the oxidation of organic contaminants with iro2 could occur at mass transfer controlled rates in the absence of dissolved oxidants under this circumstance the electrolysis rates could be similar for bdd and iro2 electrodes since the rates are controlled by the mass transfer of organic contaminants from bulk to the electrode surface additionally increasing the applied current densities can result in similar electrolysis rates of pharmaceuticals by bdd and iro2 by enabling the true kinetic rates on iro2 similar to that on bdd however increasing the current densities decreases the faradaic efficiency and costs more energy however it enhances mass transfer rates likely due to the intense gas evolution the stoichiometric excess cl as compared to urea does not impact the oxidation of pharmaceuticals in fum due to that the generation rates of fc are not sufficient to reach chlorination breakpoint 4 conclusion electro generated dissolved cl2 has been overlooked for the oxidation of organic contaminants in previous literature dissolved cl2 is the dominant oxidant for the rapid degradation of cbz while hocl is the dominant oxidant for the oxidation of smx in electrolyte only containing cl by contrast the surface adsorbed oxidants oh or iro3 cl are the dominant oxidants for the degradation of cp and ibp urea creatinine and uric acid significantly quench dissolved rcs in the solution phase this results in a mass transfer limit of pharmaceutical degradation citrate ions and h2po4 possibly quench iro3 cl resulting in a mixed kinetic and mass transfer controlled degradation of pharmaceuticals with iro2 however h2po4 and so4 2 ions do not alter the electrolysis rates of pharmaceuticals that are primarily degraded by oh the degradation of pharmaceuticals in full synthetic fresh urine matrixes fum occurs at mixed kinetic and mass transfer control with iro2 but occurs at mass transfer controlled rates with bdd for our experimental setup increasing the mass transfer rate is particularly important for both types of anodes for faster pharmaceutical degradation in fum the true kinetic rate constants for pharmaceutical oxidation are higher with bdd than with iro2 however for industrial eaops in a flow reactor re 3000 the oxidation of organic contaminants with iro2 could occur at mass transfer controlled rates in the absence of dissolved oxidants bdd is prohibitively expensive and iro2 contains rare earth elements therefore the development of economic stable and environmentally friendly anodes is desirable furthermore future work aimed at designing devices that allows fast mass transfer with minimum byproduct formation could provide significant contribution to mitigating the release organic contaminants into the environment author contributions

15736,micro nano plastics is an emerging contaminant in wastewater that has showed significant impacts on various biological treatment processes nevertheless the underlying effects of micro nano plastics with different concentrations and sizes on the anaerobic hydrogen producing granular sludge hpg were still unclear this work firstly attempted to illustrate the microbial and physicochemical responses of hpg to a shock load of polyethylene microplastics pe mps with varied concentrations and sizes the results revealed that the pe mps inhibitory effect on hydrogen production by hpg was both concentration and size dependent specifically the increase of pe mps concentration and the decline of pe mps size to nano sized plastics nps significantly decreased the hydrogen yield downgraded to 79 9 2 6 and 63 0 3 9 p 0 001 and 0 0002 of control respectively at higher mps concentration and the smaller mps size i e nps the higher pe mps concentration and pe nps also suppressed extracellular polymeric substances eps generation more severely the critical bio processes involved in hydrogen production were disturbed by pe mps with the extent of negative impacts depending on the dosage and size of pe mps these adverse impacts further manifested as granule disintegration and loss of cellular activity mechanism analysis highlighted the roles of oxidative stress leachate released from pe mps interaction between pe nps and granules inducing physical crushing of hpg that led to possible direct contact between cells and toxic substances graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords polyethylene microplastics hydrogen production nanoplastics anaerobic granular sludge extracellular polymeric substances toxicity mechanism data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the reduction of greenhouse gases ghg emission from combustion of fossil fuel is being widely carried out as an environmental protection policy all over the world looking for the alternatives of fossil fuels to reduce pollution and to alleviate energy crisis simultaneously has become one of the most promising international frontier research topics in recent years as an ideal clean energy source without carbon footprint hydrogen possesses higher efficiency in energy production approximately 142 kj g which is at least 2 75 folds as much as that of other hydrocarbons than other commonly used fuels zinatizadeh et al 2017 and produces sole by product water when burning that does not cause environmental pollution zhong et al 2020 however numerous hydrogen production technologies such as the pyrolysis fossil fuel as well as electrolysis based hydrogen production are generally energy intensive and unsustainable nikolaidis and poullikkas 2017 an environmentally friendly and cost effective hydrogen production technology is urgently required the anaerobic fermentation for biological hydrogen production can use wastewater or solid wastes containing organics as raw materials to generate hydrogen fu et al 2021 this technology has the superiorities of steady hydrogen productivity low energy demand and straightforward operation cai et al 2004 wang et al 2018b which is of great significance in clean energy production reclamation of wastes as well as environmental protection as a peculiar form of biofilm anaerobic granule has favorable settling capacity higher biomass retention and faster reaction efficiency than flocculate sludge which has come to be considered as a biological hydrogen production technology with great promise li and yu 2011 although granular sludge has been applied in hydrogen recovery from wastewater of food and paper industry successfully akutsu et al 2009 jules and lier 2008 the hydrogen producing granular sludge hpg has also confronted with some challenges for example the variations of working parameters including ph temperature and organic substrate concentration could cause the fluctuation of hydrogen production efficiency salem et al 2017 some studies have been dedicated to stabilizing and improving hydrogen production by some means such as the application of various pre treatment methods zinatizadeh et al 2017 zou and li 2016 additives kim et al 2006 yang and wang 2018 as well as the regulation of working parameters kumar et al 2016 mota et al 2018 from economic and technological perspectives anaerobic fermentation of organic wastewater under acidic e g ph 4 5 condition in hpg system is superior to other strengthened hydrogen production methods which could eliminate the hydrogen consumption bacteria through handy and low energy operation hernandez mendoza and buitron 2014 yu and mu 2006 microplastics defined as plastics fragments and particles less than 5 mm in diameter thompson et al 2004 is a by product emerged in the context of excessive use of plastics products browne et al 2011 this emerging contaminant is damaging the ecological environment at a life threatening velocity many investigations have reported the harmful impacts of microplastics on aquatic biotas i e fishes mussels seabirds zooplankton foley et al 2018 yin et al 2018 terrestrial organisms i e invertebrates fungi pollinators plants larue et al 2021 machado et al 2018 microalgae prata et al 2019 microbes i e soil microorganisms marine microorganisms oberbeckmann and labrenz 2020 wang et al 2020 and even human senathirajah et al 2021 zhang et al 2020a the current knowledge on the ecotoxicity of microplastics usually includes but is not limited to the injury of antioxidative system the disturbance of immunity and the disorder of metabolism prokic et al 2019 wang et al 2019 as one of key pathways of microplastics wastewater captures and transports more than 95 of the discharged microplastics murphy et al 2016 thus the influences of microplastics on the microbial wastewater treatment processes have aroused broad attentions wei et al 2019b confirmed the adverse functions of polyvinyl chloride microplastics pvc mps wei et al 2019b polyethylene terephthalate microplastics pet mps wei et al 2019b as well as polyethylene microplastics pe mps wei et al 2019a on anaerobic microorganisms in fermentation or digestion of sludge in the absence of oxygen for aerobic wastewater treatment system the removal efficiencies of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus fluctuated under different microplastics pressure dai et al 2020 previous studies also verified the critical roles of microplastics in the potencies of anaerobic methane producing granule such as the properties of methane yields chemical oxygen demand cod removal as well as short chain fatty acids scfas accumulation wei et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b 2020c it is noteworthy that microplastics with a variety of particle sizes such as nano sized plastics nps also exist in wastewater and their effects on microorganisms might be variable depending on their particle sizes zhao et al 2021 for instance in nitrification and denitrification processes of activated sludge the removal efficiencies of ammonia nitrite nitrate and phosphorus clearly fluctuated with the presence of different sizes of polystyrene ps microplastics he et al 2021 moreover xu et al 2021 also reported the disparate impacts of different sizes of pe mps on sludge dewaterability xu et al 2021 whereas the latent effects of micro nano plastics with different concentrations and sizes on the anaerobic hydrogen producing granular sludge have never been documented hence the target of the work was to illustrate the microbial and physicochemical responses of hpg to polyethylene microplastics pe mps as the representative microplastics i e one of microplastics with relatively high detection in sewage alimi et al 2018 with varied concentrations and sizes through analysing the variations of the hydrogen production the transformations of extracellular polymeric substances eps and the differences of granule characteristics after a shock load of pe mps exposure the bioprocesses dynamics relevant toxic mechanisms as well as the interaction between pe micro nano plastics and hpg were also characterized comprehensively it is expected that the results would be conducive to facilitate the cognizance of hpg systems with the presence of micro nano plastics 2 materials and methods 2 1 sources of hpg and pe micro nano plastics in this work the inoculated anaerobic hydrogen producing granular sludge was derived from an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor using sucrose rich wastewater for hydrogen production the organic loading rate olr of the uasb was 7 1 g cod l day with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 18 h the proportion of volatile suspended solid vss to total suspended solid tss of the hpg was approximately 88 2 the pe micro nano plastics at micro size 200 μm and nano size 50 nm were purchased from qi hong co ltd china 2 2 experiments of pe micro nano plastics influencing the performance of hpg the pe mps exposure experiments were performed in four groups of glass made identical anaerobic reactors the seed hpg was inoculated into each reactor uniformly resulting in tss concentration of 2 g l in each reactor the inoculum was cultured with a simulated sewage using glucose as the sole carbon source the major elements and micronutrients were contained in the substrate the detailed wastewater composition was referred to previous study yu and mu 2006 a low ph supervised and controlled at 4 5 0 1 was applied to weed out methanogenic bacteria and favor the hydrogen production hernandez mendoza and buitron 2014 mu and yu 2006 in consideration of the large scale production and application an increasing number of pe mps will be discharged into wastewater thus two distinct pe mps concentrations a low level of 30 mg l and a high level of 90 mg l were investigated in this study in addition the pe micro nano plastics with sizes of micro size l pe 200 um and nano size s pe 50 nm at same concentration level 90 mg l were chosen to investigate the impacts of particle size on hpg performance overall three exposure conditions were set in this study including 30 mg l 200 μm pe mps 90 mg l 200 μm pe mps and 90 mg l 50 nm pe nps marking as l pe l l pe h and s pe h respectively in addition a group of reactors without pe micro nano plastics addition was set as control for comparison all four groups of bioreactors were anaerobically operated at 37 1 c for 15 days till highest hydrogen accumulation and performed in triplicate throughout the whole experimental period the output and ingredient of total gas including h2 ch4 and co2 in all reactors were supervised at fixed periods by a gas chromatograph gc which outfitted a thermal conductivity detector tcd gc tcd lunan 6890 2 3 experiments of pe mps leachates influencing the performance of hpg the pe micro nano plastics leachates after pe mps exposure were obtained for confirming the effect of leachates on hpg performance firstly a certain amount of synthetic wastewater and the corresponding pe mps according to the conditions presented in section 2 2 were added into three groups of serum bottles with same working volume but without hpg the ph of all tests was controlled at 4 5 0 1 and the mixtures were incubated in an anaerobic condition at 37 1 c after 15 day cultivation all pe mps were removed by filtration and the residual liquors were served as the pe mps leachates the same volume of synthetic wastewater without any pe mps addition was also prepared to be a control group secondly the same amounts of hpg as in section 2 2 were then inoculated into the corresponding three leachates groups and the control group and the bottles with water sludge mixture were operated for another 15 days under the same conditions applied in section 2 2 except for no pe mps addition the hydrogen production in each bottle was monitored termly during the operation 2 4 physicochemical responses of hpg to pe micro nano plastics after the pe micro nano plastics exposure experiments in section 2 2 a laser particle size analyzer la 960v2 horiba japan was employed to detect the particle size distribution of hpg samples the granules should be pre treated before determination to remove the probable disturbance of residual pe mps in hpg in short the collected samples were rinsed by phosphate buffer solution three times and then re suspended in sodium chloride solution to separate pe mps after 15 min stirring and 2 h precipitation of the mixture the remained pe mps in hpg would float on the top of the solution on account of its low density and the pe mps can be removed by skimming the supernatant this separation process was repeated three times to make sure that there was negligible pe mps left and the final hpg samples were rinsed by deionized water to remove salt residues for the measurements of particle size distribution of hpg scanning electron microscopy sem geminisem 300 germany was also employed to visually characterize the surface and interior morphology of hpg the details of pre processing were identical as those recorded in preceding publication zhang et al 2020b 2 5 microbial responses of hpg to pe micro nano plastics after the pe micro nano plastics exposure experiments in section 2 2 live dead baclighttm bacterial viability kit molecular probes l 7012 was applied to count the live dead cells in hpg the syto 9 with green fluorescence could penetrate and stain all cells with robust and broken cytomembranes while the propidium iodide pi with red fluorescence could only label the cells with broken membranes and cause a cancellation of the syto 9 stain fluorescence when both coloring matters coexisted therefore the live cells are stained green but the red fluorescence is emerged in cells with damaged membranes before the staining process hpg derived from each bioreactor was rinsed in triplicate using phosphate buffer solution pbs and frozen at 20 c therewith the granules were split into 10 μm cross profiles and mounted onto a microscopic slide the staining procedure was executed according to the operation instruction supplied by the manufacturer in brief 3 μl miscible liquids of syto 9 and pi with volume proportion of 1 1 was added into the sections then stained sections were cultivated in the nonluminous environment for quarter at room temperature and the excess dye was edulcorated by phosphate buffer solution the prepared samples were observed and photographed by a fluorescence microscope olympus bx53 twenty views of each sample were chosen randomly for quantification and the image decoding software daime version 1 3 was used to calculate the fraction of live and dead cells via the relative abundance of green and red pixels the extraction method of eps was reformed and coalesced oscillation ultrasound and cationic resin extraction cre the constituents in eps containing proteins polysaccharides humic acids lipids and dna were quantitated specifically for the sake of visualizing the layout of eps ingredients in hpg constituents in eps were stained using fluorochrome multiply and the dyed granules were photographed by confocal laser scanning microscopy nikon a1r the detailed procedures of extraction method quantification and visualization of component of eps were according to previous work zhang et al 2020c 2 6 experiments of pe micro nano plastics influencing the hpg bioprocesses anaerobic hydrogen production from glucose involves hydrogen producing and consuming bioprocesses including acidogenesis acetogenesis and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis to fully discern the function of pe mps on all bio steps related to hydrogen production a group of additional batch experiments were conducted briefly same amount simulated sewage with the corresponding hpg as detailed in section 2 2 were added into four groups of serums achieving the tss at 2 g l approximately one control group and three experimental groups with the three pe mps exposure conditions were operated the glucose was served as the substrate for these acidogenesis assays the ph in all tests was adjusted to 4 5 0 1 using hcl or naoh all serum bottles were cultivated in an incubator at 37 1 c and the constituent of scfas were detected at interval until the negligible increment of scfas which indicated the acidification has finished for the assays of acetogenesis same procedure as acidogenesis tests was carried out except for a substitution of the feedstock i e the glucose was substituted by sodium butyrate the concentrations of acetic acid were monitored continuously until it stopped increasing for the tests of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis the same synthetic wastewater without any substrate and corresponding hpg pe mps were added into the four groups of bottles all bottles were cultivated anaerobically after adjusting the ph value at 4 5 0 1 and the hydrogen production was measured until its increasement was no longer detected making sure no hydrogen was generated from inoculum meanwhile a blended gas containing hydrogen carbon dioxide and nitrogen with proportions of 40 10 and 50 respectively was filled into each bottle after anaerobic fermentation thermostatically 37 1 c for 2 days the expenditure of hydrogen and the generation of methane were detected to assess the impact of pe mps on methanogenesis 2 7 experiments of pe micro nano plastics influencing ros generation generally the relative levels of reactive oxygen species ros can be served as the index to evaluate the degree of oxidative stress induced by pe mps firstly after the pe micro nano plastics exposure experiments in section 2 2 the ros of hpg samples from the four groups of reactors were measured referring to published document zhang et al 2021 the levels of intracellular ros were measured by the dichlorofluorescein dcf assay secondly according to the study of messina et al 2014 superoxide dismutase sod and catalase cat are two enzymes related to ros scavenging as predominant defenses to oxidation resistance in microorganisms messina et al 2014 thus additional four sets of experiments were operated to assess the role of ros generation induced by pe micro nano plastics on hydrogen production in these tests all operations were as same as the experiments of pe mps influencing the hpg performance described in section 2 2 except that 1g l sod and 1g l cat were also initially dosed into each group of bottles the productions of hydrogen and ros were both measured after these exposure tests which were directly compared to the productions of hydrogen and ros from the experiments in section 2 2 2 8 tracking the pe micro nano plastics in hpg after exposure the distribution of pe micro nano plastics in hpg after the exposure experiments in section 2 2 was characterized to further evaluate the coactions between hpg and pe micro nano plastics a novel method for microplastics detection namely fluorescence labelling method reported by erni cassola et al 2017 was applied in this study nile red technical grade n3013 sigma aldrich was used as a tool for fluorescently labelling pe micro nano plastics and nile red dissolved in methanol to a level of 1 ug ml was prepared as the staining solution for further dyeing the hpg granule samples were placed on microslides and several drops of staining solution were instilled until the surface of the whole pellet was soaked by dyestuff after dark cultivation at 60 c for 10 min the stained granules were then observed under a fluorescence microscope zeiss axioskop 40 at the wavelengths of excitation and emission at 460 and 525 nm respectively besides to track the pe micro nano plastics in the interior of the granules the hpg samples were frozen at 20 c firstly then the frozen granules were sectioned and fixed onto microslides for further staining the dye procedure was as same as described above notably to highlight the whole granule for comparison the syto 9 was used to label all cells in hpg samples which could locate the specific position of pe micro nano plastics in the granules 3 results 3 1 effects of pe micro nano plastics and their leachates on hydrogen production by hpg hydrogen accumulations in all groups of reactors were monitored continuously until the increment of hydrogen productions were negligible and the final cumulative hydrogen production in the experiments of pe mps exposure and corresponding leachates exposure were recorded in fig 1 as shown in fig 1 both two exposure concentrations of pe mps 30 mg l and 90 mg l with micro size 200 um presented adverse effects on hydrogen yield resulting in 12 0 3 7 and 20 1 2 6 p 0 01 and 0 001 inhibition in l pe l and l pe h compared to the control respectively for the same pe mps concentration 90 mg l compared to the micro size pe mps 200 um more significant decline in the hydrogen yield was induced by pe nps at nanoscale 50 nm dropping to 63 0 3 9 p 0 0002 of the control fig 1 also clearly displayed that when hpg was exposed to the homologous pe mps leachates the hydrogen production was 95 2 2 1 89 7 1 1 and 89 8 2 4 p 0 1 0 01 and 0 02 of the control with the existence of corresponding leachates at l pe l l pe h and s pe h severally these outcomes suggested that in the case of the same pe mps size at micro scale the impacts of pe mps on hydrogen generation of hpg was related to pe mps concentration and higher level of pe mps had stronger perniciousness to hydrogen production by hpg for the two different sizes of pe mps with same concentration the suppression of hydrogen production became more severe when the particle size was at nanoscale i e pe nps although the corresponding leachates also had a similar adverse effect on hydrogen production the inhibitory effect was weaker than that of direct contacting of pe mps notably the degree of inhibitory effect of pe mps leachates was showed to be only depending on pe mps concentration which did not show any clear relationship with pe mps particle size fig 1 3 2 effects of pe micro nano plastics on morphology characteristics and physiological activity of hpg fig 2 a recorded the granule size distribution of hpg in all four groups of reactors after the shock load of pe mps the size of hpg in each group was distributed in the range of 0 3458 7 um and the exposure of pe mps affected the granule size of hpg significantly the largest granule size of hpg was concentrated in 1167 7 um in all tests without exception accounting for 9 9 9 8 10 4 and 5 6 in the experiments of control l pe l l pe h and s pe h respectively the medium granule diameters d v 0 5 of experimental groups were all smaller than that of the control group 801 1 um and the average diameter of hpg exposed to nano size pe mps even reduced to 670 3 um while that of control was 804 6 um scanning electron microscope was used to photograph the overall appearances of hpg from control group and experimental group with nano size pe mps exposure and the microphotographs were displayed in fig 2b the granule under stress of nano size pe mps had deep cracks in surface and was clearly disintegrated in contrast the granule from control reactor without pe mps addition was compact and intact with the results of hpg granule size distribution the augmentation of the proportions of smaller granules might be given the credit to granule breakage the viability of microbes in hpg from these two groups was further analyzed by staining and counting the dead and live cells and the visualized outcomes were listed in fig 2c as shown in these pictures the viable cells were stained in green fluorescence while the devitalized cells were labelled in red contrasted to the granule from control reactor the dead cells in hpg from experimental reactor s pe h increased obviously which increased from 5 4 1 1 control to 23 8 1 7 p 9 73e 05 besides the overall shape of granule in experimental reactor was loose with obvious cracks presented in granule 3 3 effects of pe micro nano plastics on the ingredient and distribution of eps in hpg eps as the skeleton structure of granular sludge contributes immeasurably to agglomeration and protection of microorganisms he et al 2017 mu et al 2012 therefore the composition and structure of eps in hpg play a crucial role in the hpg performance a reformative oscillation ultrasound united cationic resin extraction means was used to extract eps from hpg and the main components in eps were quantitatively analyzed as the results revealed in fig 3 a proteins polysaccharides and lipids were relatively larger ingredients in eps with proportion more than 80 of the total eps the presence of pe mps exhibited a clear inhibitory effect on the eps production leading to the decreased concentrations of them when hpg exposed to different levels of pe mps with same micro size the concentrations of proteins polysaccharides and lipids decreased with increasing pe mps concentrations resulting in 15 2 1 0 17 4 3 9 and 10 3 4 2 p 0 001 0 003 and 0 02 decline at 90 mg l of micro size pe mps respectively but no remarkable variations reflected in the contents of humic acids in contrast there was a distinct correlation between pe mps size and contents of eps ingredients the contents of proteins polysaccharides lipids and humic acids reduced gradually with the decreasing size of pe mps from microscale to nanoscale causing 38 7 3 6 33 3 1 4 21 0 2 4 and 14 0 1 0 p 0 0002 2 63e 05 0 0003 and 2 26e 05 suppression at 90 mg l of nano size pe nps noteworthy the variation trend of dna concentration was opposite compared to the control the concentrations of dna increased 4 8 0 2 and 21 2 0 2 p 0 001 and 3 75e 06 in l pe h and s pe h respectively which might be related to an increase in dead cells in granules induced by pe mps in addition the distribution of eps in hpg was labelled with fluorescence dyes and observed through confocal laser scanning microscope and the contrast diagrams of control group and experimental group s pe h were displayed in fig 3b c in these photomicrographs protein was stained as green fluorescence while red and blue fluorescence represented α d glucopyranose and β d glucopyranose polysaccharides severally compared with the control the fluorescence intensities of green red and blue in experimental group weakened in different degrees which were consistent with the quantitative results of proteins and polysaccharides in fig 3a distinguished from integrity and compactness of the eps in granules from the control reactor the layout of eps in granules from experimental group was irregular and loose which showed a tendency to disintegrate 3 4 effects of pe micro nano plastics on bioprocesses in hpg the anaerobic fermentation of glucose for hydrogen generation usually undergoes acidogenesis and acetogenesis except for the steps involved in hydrogen production the generated hydrogen as the intermediate product can be also consumed in the process of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis all of these bioprocesses were generally co occurred in anaerobic fermentation and connected to the ultimate hydrogen accumulation thus the independent evaluations of the effects of pe mps on every process were necessary the influence of pe mps on the acidification was explored by scfas production and the data was presented in fig 4 a the pe mps restrained the generation of acetic and butyric acids and this inhibitory effect was regularly correlated with the concentration and particle size of pe mps the suppression was intensified with concentration increment and size decrement and the acetic acid producing microbes were more fragile to the shock of pe mps than butyric acid producing anaerobes however inconspicuous variation was detected in the production of propionic acid except acidogenesis step the bio process of acetogenesis is another step for hydrogen generation accompanied by the transformation of butyric to acetic acid and the influence of pe mps on this step was evaluated through the yield of acetic acid as shown in fig 4b pe mps restrained the conversions of butyric to acetic acid and the suppressive effect even achieved 27 1 3 4 p 0 0002 at 90 mg l nano size pe mps the impact of pe mps on the hydrogen consuming step was interpreted through hydrogen expenditure and methane production in all assays negligible changes of hydrogen and methane generation were measured indicated that methanogens were almost completely weeded out under acidic i e ph 4 5 condition regardless the presence of pe mps and this phenomenon has been documented in previous publications hernandez mendoza and buitron 2014 yu and mu 2006 as such pe mps showed no impacts on hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis 3 5 effects of pe micro nano plastics on oxidative stress in hpg the levels of oxidative stress induced by pe mps in the four exposure systems were examined by ros measurements as shown in fig 4d the extents of oxidative damage became more severe with the elevated pe mps levels and shrunken particle size of pe mps reflected in 7 4 3 3 19 3 2 1 and 39 8 4 9 p 0 02 0 0002 and 0 0002 increase in ros generations in the three experimental assays of l pe l l pe h and s pe h respectively microbes usually have their own antioxidant defense system to repair trauma caused by moderate external toxicity and prevent further injury functioning through anti oxidants i e sod cat ma et al 2016 additional experimental results suggested that the addition of extra scavengers alleviated excessive ros production to a certain extent besides a mitigatory inhibition could be also indicated in the increased hydrogen production achieving up to 93 1 3 0 86 3 2 7 and 78 9 1 7 p 0 02 0 001 and 7 65e 05 of the control whereas the hydrogen production in tests without any anti oxidants addition was 88 0 3 7 79 9 2 6 and 63 0 3 9 p 0 01 0 001 and 0 0002 of control in l pe l l pe h and s pe h respectively these findings indicated that superfluous ros induced by pe mps had a negative effect on hpg and their performance 3 6 interactions between pe micro nano plastics and hpg to further evaluate the interaction between hpg and pe mps the fluorescent dyeing technique was applied to trace the track of pe micro nano plastics in hpg as such the surface and sectional diagrams of granules derived from the control and experimental reactors l pe h and s pe h were focused for comparison it can observe from fig 5 that a mass of pe mps pe nps adhered and agglomerated on the outside surface of hpg creating direct contact between pe mps pe nps and external cells in hpg fig 5 also clearly demonstrated the distribution of pe mps pe nps in the cross section of hpg as exposure time went on nano size pe nps transferred into inner layer of experimental hpg resulting in more cells faced stress of pe nps directly these direct contacts could induce physical crush and oxidative injury corresponding with the rise of dead cells in the inside and outside of experimental hpg furthermore the cavities in hpg might be clogged by pe nps blocking the transmissive channel of nutrients which might accelerate the disintegration of granules this observation was also supported by the sem images in fig 2b however few pe mps were observed at the periphery of the cross section that because the mature granule had favorable micro pore construction with a medial aperture range from 292 nm to 447 nm wei et al 2020 micro size pe mps might not be able to enter into the core of hpg these results suggested that pe nps at nanoscale could induce stronger inhibition to hpg than pe mps 4 discussion several previous publications reported the impacts of microplastics on biological sewage and sludge treatment systems mostly focusing on the concentration variations of microplastics however the influence of microplastics on the anaerobic hydrogen producing granular sludge relevant to both concentrations and sizes of microplastics has never been studied especially for the difference between micro size and nano size microplastics this work provided a first insight about the adverse influences of pe mps and pe nps on the microbial and physicochemical characteristics of hpg for hydrogen recovery from wastewater in anaerobic fermentation in general hydrogen production is considered as the most intuitive indicator to evaluate the toxicity of contaminants to hpg performance the results indicated that the suppression effect on hydrogen production reached up to 20 1 2 6 p 0 001 with the increase of pe mps concentrations and the hydrogen generation gradually reduced to 63 0 3 9 p 0 0002 of control with the decrease of pe mps size to nanoscale in addition to the hydrogen yield of hpg pe mps also showed negative effects on the microbial metabolism and granule morphology the key bioprocesses of acidogenesis and acetogenesis were restrained irreparably at high level of pe mps demonstrating that both metabolic pathways of acetate type to butyrate type fermentation in hydrogen recovery were destructed severely while the microbes related to these two fermentative pathways were predominant in hydrogen production system wang et al 2018a theoretically butyric acid is the substrate for acetogenesis step li et al 2020 as such the limitation of butyric acid production from acidogenesis process undoubtedly set potential barrier to the following acetogenesis step furthermore the secretion of eps by hpg was also disordered by pe micro nano plastics resulting in the reduced concentrations of proteins polysaccharides lipids and humic acids in eps such suppression was evidenced particularly in proteins and polysaccharides which generally act a crucial role in formation and stabilization of granular sludge mcswain et al 2005 seviour et al 2012 inhibition of eps secretion leaded to the loss of skeleton structure of granule led to decreased capability to perform the function of adhesion and aggregation of cells he et al 2017 mu et al 2012 and thus resulting in the possible disintegration of granules this was also verified by the results of the reduced granule size as well as the crushed morphology from microcosmic investigation cells in granules subjected to nano size pe nps showed more fragile viability and the cytotoxicity induced by pe nps leaded to the release of intracellular dna and the high mortality of cells these results suggested pe micro nano plastics caused performance deterioration particle disintegration and metabolic disturbance of hpg fluorescence tracer technique was thus used to track the location of pe mps in hpg after exposure from granule surface to core in order to reveal the interaction between microplastics and hpg more intuitively unlike pe mps that only adhered to the outer surface of hpg pe nps could also penetrate into the core of granule on the one hand the size of pe nps 50 nm was much smaller than the aperture of hpg which in the range of 292 447 nm wei et al 2020 on the other hand this also might be due to the cracks increment caused by the reduced eps providing more unobstructed channel for the infiltration of pe nps furthermore the agglomerated pe nps might also clog the metabolic channels of hpg wei et al 2020 and enhance the mechanical friction with granule which might accelerate the disintegration of granules feng et al 2020 xu et al 2021 except for the physical crushing the interaction between pe nps and granule also created more opportunities for pe nps to directly contact with cells leading to more cell inside hpg exposure to the toxic micro environment pe mps leachate was revealed to be one of the contributing factors of such toxic micro environment previous studies have affirmed the poisonousness of microplastics was closely related to the leached plastic additives gandara e silva et al 2016 li et al 2016 in this work it was confirmed that the pe mps leachate did pose a certain inhibition to the hydrogen production by hpg fig 1 however there was no obvious relevancy between the inhibition effect and the variation of pe mps sizes and the inhibition effect was weaker than that of direct exposure to pe mps suggesting the contribution from other toxic factor in the toxic micro environment many publications have confirmed that microplastics with micro size around 200 um could trigger excessive ros generation choi et al 2020a yu et al 2021 causing destruction of redox balance and peroxidation of cells choi et al 2018 xia et al 2008 besides a negative correlation between ros levels and particles size of microplastics was also reported by some literatures wang et al 2020 choi et al 2020b with nano size inducing upgraded level of ros homologous results were also verified in this study the other key toxicity contributor induced by pe mps in this work was oxidative stress indicated by ros generation and the contents of ros clearly elevated with the increasing exposure concentrations and the decreasing sizes of pe mps reaching extremum at high concentration of pe nps exposure normally cells have the ability to repair oxidative damage automatically to some extent via enzymatic reactions but this capacity is not inexhaustible because of the limited amount of antioxidant enzymes ma et al 2016 therefore we further demonstrated that adding exogenous ros scavengers i e sod and cat into the hpg mps system can alleviate the toxicity of pe mps effectively strongly evidencing again that ros production induced by pe mps contributed to the overall pe mps inhibition on the hydrogen production by hpg anaerobic fermentation for hydrogen production from wastewater by hpg can effectively combine organic waste disposal and clean energy recovery li et al 2020 pandering to current global development strategies for carbon abatement micro nano plastics pollution is evolving at a rate that threatens ecological environment chen et al 2020 which is now almost ubiquitously existing in wastewater with variable concentrations and sizes however both the microbial and physicochemical responses of hpg to micro nano plastics exposure is still poorly understood which might hinder the application of hpg technology under emerging micro nano plastics stresses this work comprehensively revealed the adverse impacts of pe mps on hpg and this inhibitory effect significantly deepened with the increase of concentration and the decrease of size this study also provided understanding into the potential toxic mechanism of pe mps multidimensionally regarding these malignant consequences notably we demonstrated that the addition of exogenous ros scavengers could mitigate oxidative damage caused by pe mps to some extent similar result was also documented in published literature ma et al 2016 e g augment of sod activity protected cells of earthworm from oxidative stress induced by di n butyl phthalate ma et al 2019 developed a bifunctional single atom based enzyme which could excellently mimic the activities of sod and cat for scavenging superfluous ros in cells this strategy might be useful for controlling the mps inhibition however its practical implication in wastewater treatment needs to be further explored it is looking forward that the findings of this study would be functional for improving the design and operation of hpg systems for hydrogen production under emerging micro nano plastic stresses and potentially alleviating the toxicity of micro nano plastics 5 conclusions this work demonstrated firstly that hydrogen production by hpg was affected by pe mps and this inhibition became more severe with the increasing concentration and decreasing size of pe mps except for deteriorating hydrogen producing performance pe mps exposure also leaded to the disruption of hpg metabolism including eps secretion and biological reactions resulting in the elevation of dead cells in hpg and the progressive disintegration of granule the infiltration of nano size pe nps from outer sphere to inner layer of granule increased the likelihood of cells in hpg directly exposed to toxic micro environments which were favored by the toxic contributors of excessive ros generation and leachates release declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

15736,micro nano plastics is an emerging contaminant in wastewater that has showed significant impacts on various biological treatment processes nevertheless the underlying effects of micro nano plastics with different concentrations and sizes on the anaerobic hydrogen producing granular sludge hpg were still unclear this work firstly attempted to illustrate the microbial and physicochemical responses of hpg to a shock load of polyethylene microplastics pe mps with varied concentrations and sizes the results revealed that the pe mps inhibitory effect on hydrogen production by hpg was both concentration and size dependent specifically the increase of pe mps concentration and the decline of pe mps size to nano sized plastics nps significantly decreased the hydrogen yield downgraded to 79 9 2 6 and 63 0 3 9 p 0 001 and 0 0002 of control respectively at higher mps concentration and the smaller mps size i e nps the higher pe mps concentration and pe nps also suppressed extracellular polymeric substances eps generation more severely the critical bio processes involved in hydrogen production were disturbed by pe mps with the extent of negative impacts depending on the dosage and size of pe mps these adverse impacts further manifested as granule disintegration and loss of cellular activity mechanism analysis highlighted the roles of oxidative stress leachate released from pe mps interaction between pe nps and granules inducing physical crushing of hpg that led to possible direct contact between cells and toxic substances graphical abstract image graphical abstract

request 1 introduction the reduction of greenhouse gases ghg emission from combustion of fossil fuel is being widely carried out as an environmental protection policy all over the world looking for the alternatives of fossil fuels to reduce pollution and to alleviate energy crisis simultaneously has become one of the most promising international frontier research topics in recent years as an ideal clean energy source without carbon footprint hydrogen possesses higher efficiency in energy production approximately 142 kj g which is at least 2 75 folds as much as that of other hydrocarbons than other commonly used fuels zinatizadeh et al 2017 and produces sole by product water when burning that does not cause environmental pollution zhong et al 2020 however numerous hydrogen production technologies such as the pyrolysis fossil fuel as well as electrolysis based hydrogen production are generally energy intensive and unsustainable nikolaidis and poullikkas 2017 an environmentally friendly and cost effective hydrogen production technology is urgently required the anaerobic fermentation for biological hydrogen production can use wastewater or solid wastes containing organics as raw materials to generate hydrogen fu et al 2021 this technology has the superiorities of steady hydrogen productivity low energy demand and straightforward operation cai et al 2004 wang et al 2018b which is of great significance in clean energy production reclamation of wastes as well as environmental protection as a peculiar form of biofilm anaerobic granule has favorable settling capacity higher biomass retention and faster reaction efficiency than flocculate sludge which has come to be considered as a biological hydrogen production technology with great promise li and yu 2011 although granular sludge has been applied in hydrogen recovery from wastewater of food and paper industry successfully akutsu et al 2009 jules and lier 2008 the hydrogen producing granular sludge hpg has also confronted with some challenges for example the variations of working parameters including ph temperature and organic substrate concentration could cause the fluctuation of hydrogen production efficiency salem et al 2017 some studies have been dedicated to stabilizing and improving hydrogen production by some means such as the application of various pre treatment methods zinatizadeh et al 2017 zou and li 2016 additives kim et al 2006 yang and wang 2018 as well as the regulation of working parameters kumar et al 2016 mota et al 2018 from economic and technological perspectives anaerobic fermentation of organic wastewater under acidic e g ph 4 5 condition in hpg system is superior to other strengthened hydrogen production methods which could eliminate the hydrogen consumption bacteria through handy and low energy operation hernandez mendoza and buitron 2014 yu and mu 2006 microplastics defined as plastics fragments and particles less than 5 mm in diameter thompson et al 2004 is a by product emerged in the context of excessive use of plastics products browne et al 2011 this emerging contaminant is damaging the ecological environment at a life threatening velocity many investigations have reported the harmful impacts of microplastics on aquatic biotas i e fishes mussels seabirds zooplankton foley et al 2018 yin et al 2018 terrestrial organisms i e invertebrates fungi pollinators plants larue et al 2021 machado et al 2018 microalgae prata et al 2019 microbes i e soil microorganisms marine microorganisms oberbeckmann and labrenz 2020 wang et al 2020 and even human senathirajah et al 2021 zhang et al 2020a the current knowledge on the ecotoxicity of microplastics usually includes but is not limited to the injury of antioxidative system the disturbance of immunity and the disorder of metabolism prokic et al 2019 wang et al 2019 as one of key pathways of microplastics wastewater captures and transports more than 95 of the discharged microplastics murphy et al 2016 thus the influences of microplastics on the microbial wastewater treatment processes have aroused broad attentions wei et al 2019b confirmed the adverse functions of polyvinyl chloride microplastics pvc mps wei et al 2019b polyethylene terephthalate microplastics pet mps wei et al 2019b as well as polyethylene microplastics pe mps wei et al 2019a on anaerobic microorganisms in fermentation or digestion of sludge in the absence of oxygen for aerobic wastewater treatment system the removal efficiencies of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus fluctuated under different microplastics pressure dai et al 2020 previous studies also verified the critical roles of microplastics in the potencies of anaerobic methane producing granule such as the properties of methane yields chemical oxygen demand cod removal as well as short chain fatty acids scfas accumulation wei et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b 2020c it is noteworthy that microplastics with a variety of particle sizes such as nano sized plastics nps also exist in wastewater and their effects on microorganisms might be variable depending on their particle sizes zhao et al 2021 for instance in nitrification and denitrification processes of activated sludge the removal efficiencies of ammonia nitrite nitrate and phosphorus clearly fluctuated with the presence of different sizes of polystyrene ps microplastics he et al 2021 moreover xu et al 2021 also reported the disparate impacts of different sizes of pe mps on sludge dewaterability xu et al 2021 whereas the latent effects of micro nano plastics with different concentrations and sizes on the anaerobic hydrogen producing granular sludge have never been documented hence the target of the work was to illustrate the microbial and physicochemical responses of hpg to polyethylene microplastics pe mps as the representative microplastics i e one of microplastics with relatively high detection in sewage alimi et al 2018 with varied concentrations and sizes through analysing the variations of the hydrogen production the transformations of extracellular polymeric substances eps and the differences of granule characteristics after a shock load of pe mps exposure the bioprocesses dynamics relevant toxic mechanisms as well as the interaction between pe micro nano plastics and hpg were also characterized comprehensively it is expected that the results would be conducive to facilitate the cognizance of hpg systems with the presence of micro nano plastics 2 materials and methods 2 1 sources of hpg and pe micro nano plastics in this work the inoculated anaerobic hydrogen producing granular sludge was derived from an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor using sucrose rich wastewater for hydrogen production the organic loading rate olr of the uasb was 7 1 g cod l day with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 18 h the proportion of volatile suspended solid vss to total suspended solid tss of the hpg was approximately 88 2 the pe micro nano plastics at micro size 200 μm and nano size 50 nm were purchased from qi hong co ltd china 2 2 experiments of pe micro nano plastics influencing the performance of hpg the pe mps exposure experiments were performed in four groups of glass made identical anaerobic reactors the seed hpg was inoculated into each reactor uniformly resulting in tss concentration of 2 g l in each reactor the inoculum was cultured with a simulated sewage using glucose as the sole carbon source the major elements and micronutrients were contained in the substrate the detailed wastewater composition was referred to previous study yu and mu 2006 a low ph supervised and controlled at 4 5 0 1 was applied to weed out methanogenic bacteria and favor the hydrogen production hernandez mendoza and buitron 2014 mu and yu 2006 in consideration of the large scale production and application an increasing number of pe mps will be discharged into wastewater thus two distinct pe mps concentrations a low level of 30 mg l and a high level of 90 mg l were investigated in this study in addition the pe micro nano plastics with sizes of micro size l pe 200 um and nano size s pe 50 nm at same concentration level 90 mg l were chosen to investigate the impacts of particle size on hpg performance overall three exposure conditions were set in this study including 30 mg l 200 μm pe mps 90 mg l 200 μm pe mps and 90 mg l 50 nm pe nps marking as l pe l l pe h and s pe h respectively in addition a group of reactors without pe micro nano plastics addition was set as control for comparison all four groups of bioreactors were anaerobically operated at 37 1 c for 15 days till highest hydrogen accumulation and performed in triplicate throughout the whole experimental period the output and ingredient of total gas including h2 ch4 and co2 in all reactors were supervised at fixed periods by a gas chromatograph gc which outfitted a thermal conductivity detector tcd gc tcd lunan 6890 2 3 experiments of pe mps leachates influencing the performance of hpg the pe micro nano plastics leachates after pe mps exposure were obtained for confirming the effect of leachates on hpg performance firstly a certain amount of synthetic wastewater and the corresponding pe mps according to the conditions presented in section 2 2 were added into three groups of serum bottles with same working volume but without hpg the ph of all tests was controlled at 4 5 0 1 and the mixtures were incubated in an anaerobic condition at 37 1 c after 15 day cultivation all pe mps were removed by filtration and the residual liquors were served as the pe mps leachates the same volume of synthetic wastewater without any pe mps addition was also prepared to be a control group secondly the same amounts of hpg as in section 2 2 were then inoculated into the corresponding three leachates groups and the control group and the bottles with water sludge mixture were operated for another 15 days under the same conditions applied in section 2 2 except for no pe mps addition the hydrogen production in each bottle was monitored termly during the operation 2 4 physicochemical responses of hpg to pe micro nano plastics after the pe micro nano plastics exposure experiments in section 2 2 a laser particle size analyzer la 960v2 horiba japan was employed to detect the particle size distribution of hpg samples the granules should be pre treated before determination to remove the probable disturbance of residual pe mps in hpg in short the collected samples were rinsed by phosphate buffer solution three times and then re suspended in sodium chloride solution to separate pe mps after 15 min stirring and 2 h precipitation of the mixture the remained pe mps in hpg would float on the top of the solution on account of its low density and the pe mps can be removed by skimming the supernatant this separation process was repeated three times to make sure that there was negligible pe mps left and the final hpg samples were rinsed by deionized water to remove salt residues for the measurements of particle size distribution of hpg scanning electron microscopy sem geminisem 300 germany was also employed to visually characterize the surface and interior morphology of hpg the details of pre processing were identical as those recorded in preceding publication zhang et al 2020b 2 5 microbial responses of hpg to pe micro nano plastics after the pe micro nano plastics exposure experiments in section 2 2 live dead baclighttm bacterial viability kit molecular probes l 7012 was applied to count the live dead cells in hpg the syto 9 with green fluorescence could penetrate and stain all cells with robust and broken cytomembranes while the propidium iodide pi with red fluorescence could only label the cells with broken membranes and cause a cancellation of the syto 9 stain fluorescence when both coloring matters coexisted therefore the live cells are stained green but the red fluorescence is emerged in cells with damaged membranes before the staining process hpg derived from each bioreactor was rinsed in triplicate using phosphate buffer solution pbs and frozen at 20 c therewith the granules were split into 10 μm cross profiles and mounted onto a microscopic slide the staining procedure was executed according to the operation instruction supplied by the manufacturer in brief 3 μl miscible liquids of syto 9 and pi with volume proportion of 1 1 was added into the sections then stained sections were cultivated in the nonluminous environment for quarter at room temperature and the excess dye was edulcorated by phosphate buffer solution the prepared samples were observed and photographed by a fluorescence microscope olympus bx53 twenty views of each sample were chosen randomly for quantification and the image decoding software daime version 1 3 was used to calculate the fraction of live and dead cells via the relative abundance of green and red pixels the extraction method of eps was reformed and coalesced oscillation ultrasound and cationic resin extraction cre the constituents in eps containing proteins polysaccharides humic acids lipids and dna were quantitated specifically for the sake of visualizing the layout of eps ingredients in hpg constituents in eps were stained using fluorochrome multiply and the dyed granules were photographed by confocal laser scanning microscopy nikon a1r the detailed procedures of extraction method quantification and visualization of component of eps were according to previous work zhang et al 2020c 2 6 experiments of pe micro nano plastics influencing the hpg bioprocesses anaerobic hydrogen production from glucose involves hydrogen producing and consuming bioprocesses including acidogenesis acetogenesis and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis to fully discern the function of pe mps on all bio steps related to hydrogen production a group of additional batch experiments were conducted briefly same amount simulated sewage with the corresponding hpg as detailed in section 2 2 were added into four groups of serums achieving the tss at 2 g l approximately one control group and three experimental groups with the three pe mps exposure conditions were operated the glucose was served as the substrate for these acidogenesis assays the ph in all tests was adjusted to 4 5 0 1 using hcl or naoh all serum bottles were cultivated in an incubator at 37 1 c and the constituent of scfas were detected at interval until the negligible increment of scfas which indicated the acidification has finished for the assays of acetogenesis same procedure as acidogenesis tests was carried out except for a substitution of the feedstock i e the glucose was substituted by sodium butyrate the concentrations of acetic acid were monitored continuously until it stopped increasing for the tests of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis the same synthetic wastewater without any substrate and corresponding hpg pe mps were added into the four groups of bottles all bottles were cultivated anaerobically after adjusting the ph value at 4 5 0 1 and the hydrogen production was measured until its increasement was no longer detected making sure no hydrogen was generated from inoculum meanwhile a blended gas containing hydrogen carbon dioxide and nitrogen with proportions of 40 10 and 50 respectively was filled into each bottle after anaerobic fermentation thermostatically 37 1 c for 2 days the expenditure of hydrogen and the generation of methane were detected to assess the impact of pe mps on methanogenesis 2 7 experiments of pe micro nano plastics influencing ros generation generally the relative levels of reactive oxygen species ros can be served as the index to evaluate the degree of oxidative stress induced by pe mps firstly after the pe micro nano plastics exposure experiments in section 2 2 the ros of hpg samples from the four groups of reactors were measured referring to published document zhang et al 2021 the levels of intracellular ros were measured by the dichlorofluorescein dcf assay secondly according to the study of messina et al 2014 superoxide dismutase sod and catalase cat are two enzymes related to ros scavenging as predominant defenses to oxidation resistance in microorganisms messina et al 2014 thus additional four sets of experiments were operated to assess the role of ros generation induced by pe micro nano plastics on hydrogen production in these tests all operations were as same as the experiments of pe mps influencing the hpg performance described in section 2 2 except that 1g l sod and 1g l cat were also initially dosed into each group of bottles the productions of hydrogen and ros were both measured after these exposure tests which were directly compared to the productions of hydrogen and ros from the experiments in section 2 2 2 8 tracking the pe micro nano plastics in hpg after exposure the distribution of pe micro nano plastics in hpg after the exposure experiments in section 2 2 was characterized to further evaluate the coactions between hpg and pe micro nano plastics a novel method for microplastics detection namely fluorescence labelling method reported by erni cassola et al 2017 was applied in this study nile red technical grade n3013 sigma aldrich was used as a tool for fluorescently labelling pe micro nano plastics and nile red dissolved in methanol to a level of 1 ug ml was prepared as the staining solution for further dyeing the hpg granule samples were placed on microslides and several drops of staining solution were instilled until the surface of the whole pellet was soaked by dyestuff after dark cultivation at 60 c for 10 min the stained granules were then observed under a fluorescence microscope zeiss axioskop 40 at the wavelengths of excitation and emission at 460 and 525 nm respectively besides to track the pe micro nano plastics in the interior of the granules the hpg samples were frozen at 20 c firstly then the frozen granules were sectioned and fixed onto microslides for further staining the dye procedure was as same as described above notably to highlight the whole granule for comparison the syto 9 was used to label all cells in hpg samples which could locate the specific position of pe micro nano plastics in the granules 3 results 3 1 effects of pe micro nano plastics and their leachates on hydrogen production by hpg hydrogen accumulations in all groups of reactors were monitored continuously until the increment of hydrogen productions were negligible and the final cumulative hydrogen production in the experiments of pe mps exposure and corresponding leachates exposure were recorded in fig 1 as shown in fig 1 both two exposure concentrations of pe mps 30 mg l and 90 mg l with micro size 200 um presented adverse effects on hydrogen yield resulting in 12 0 3 7 and 20 1 2 6 p 0 01 and 0 001 inhibition in l pe l and l pe h compared to the control respectively for the same pe mps concentration 90 mg l compared to the micro size pe mps 200 um more significant decline in the hydrogen yield was induced by pe nps at nanoscale 50 nm dropping to 63 0 3 9 p 0 0002 of the control fig 1 also clearly displayed that when hpg was exposed to the homologous pe mps leachates the hydrogen production was 95 2 2 1 89 7 1 1 and 89 8 2 4 p 0 1 0 01 and 0 02 of the control with the existence of corresponding leachates at l pe l l pe h and s pe h severally these outcomes suggested that in the case of the same pe mps size at micro scale the impacts of pe mps on hydrogen generation of hpg was related to pe mps concentration and higher level of pe mps had stronger perniciousness to hydrogen production by hpg for the two different sizes of pe mps with same concentration the suppression of hydrogen production became more severe when the particle size was at nanoscale i e pe nps although the corresponding leachates also had a similar adverse effect on hydrogen production the inhibitory effect was weaker than that of direct contacting of pe mps notably the degree of inhibitory effect of pe mps leachates was showed to be only depending on pe mps concentration which did not show any clear relationship with pe mps particle size fig 1 3 2 effects of pe micro nano plastics on morphology characteristics and physiological activity of hpg fig 2 a recorded the granule size distribution of hpg in all four groups of reactors after the shock load of pe mps the size of hpg in each group was distributed in the range of 0 3458 7 um and the exposure of pe mps affected the granule size of hpg significantly the largest granule size of hpg was concentrated in 1167 7 um in all tests without exception accounting for 9 9 9 8 10 4 and 5 6 in the experiments of control l pe l l pe h and s pe h respectively the medium granule diameters d v 0 5 of experimental groups were all smaller than that of the control group 801 1 um and the average diameter of hpg exposed to nano size pe mps even reduced to 670 3 um while that of control was 804 6 um scanning electron microscope was used to photograph the overall appearances of hpg from control group and experimental group with nano size pe mps exposure and the microphotographs were displayed in fig 2b the granule under stress of nano size pe mps had deep cracks in surface and was clearly disintegrated in contrast the granule from control reactor without pe mps addition was compact and intact with the results of hpg granule size distribution the augmentation of the proportions of smaller granules might be given the credit to granule breakage the viability of microbes in hpg from these two groups was further analyzed by staining and counting the dead and live cells and the visualized outcomes were listed in fig 2c as shown in these pictures the viable cells were stained in green fluorescence while the devitalized cells were labelled in red contrasted to the granule from control reactor the dead cells in hpg from experimental reactor s pe h increased obviously which increased from 5 4 1 1 control to 23 8 1 7 p 9 73e 05 besides the overall shape of granule in experimental reactor was loose with obvious cracks presented in granule 3 3 effects of pe micro nano plastics on the ingredient and distribution of eps in hpg eps as the skeleton structure of granular sludge contributes immeasurably to agglomeration and protection of microorganisms he et al 2017 mu et al 2012 therefore the composition and structure of eps in hpg play a crucial role in the hpg performance a reformative oscillation ultrasound united cationic resin extraction means was used to extract eps from hpg and the main components in eps were quantitatively analyzed as the results revealed in fig 3 a proteins polysaccharides and lipids were relatively larger ingredients in eps with proportion more than 80 of the total eps the presence of pe mps exhibited a clear inhibitory effect on the eps production leading to the decreased concentrations of them when hpg exposed to different levels of pe mps with same micro size the concentrations of proteins polysaccharides and lipids decreased with increasing pe mps concentrations resulting in 15 2 1 0 17 4 3 9 and 10 3 4 2 p 0 001 0 003 and 0 02 decline at 90 mg l of micro size pe mps respectively but no remarkable variations reflected in the contents of humic acids in contrast there was a distinct correlation between pe mps size and contents of eps ingredients the contents of proteins polysaccharides lipids and humic acids reduced gradually with the decreasing size of pe mps from microscale to nanoscale causing 38 7 3 6 33 3 1 4 21 0 2 4 and 14 0 1 0 p 0 0002 2 63e 05 0 0003 and 2 26e 05 suppression at 90 mg l of nano size pe nps noteworthy the variation trend of dna concentration was opposite compared to the control the concentrations of dna increased 4 8 0 2 and 21 2 0 2 p 0 001 and 3 75e 06 in l pe h and s pe h respectively which might be related to an increase in dead cells in granules induced by pe mps in addition the distribution of eps in hpg was labelled with fluorescence dyes and observed through confocal laser scanning microscope and the contrast diagrams of control group and experimental group s pe h were displayed in fig 3b c in these photomicrographs protein was stained as green fluorescence while red and blue fluorescence represented α d glucopyranose and β d glucopyranose polysaccharides severally compared with the control the fluorescence intensities of green red and blue in experimental group weakened in different degrees which were consistent with the quantitative results of proteins and polysaccharides in fig 3a distinguished from integrity and compactness of the eps in granules from the control reactor the layout of eps in granules from experimental group was irregular and loose which showed a tendency to disintegrate 3 4 effects of pe micro nano plastics on bioprocesses in hpg the anaerobic fermentation of glucose for hydrogen generation usually undergoes acidogenesis and acetogenesis except for the steps involved in hydrogen production the generated hydrogen as the intermediate product can be also consumed in the process of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis all of these bioprocesses were generally co occurred in anaerobic fermentation and connected to the ultimate hydrogen accumulation thus the independent evaluations of the effects of pe mps on every process were necessary the influence of pe mps on the acidification was explored by scfas production and the data was presented in fig 4 a the pe mps restrained the generation of acetic and butyric acids and this inhibitory effect was regularly correlated with the concentration and particle size of pe mps the suppression was intensified with concentration increment and size decrement and the acetic acid producing microbes were more fragile to the shock of pe mps than butyric acid producing anaerobes however inconspicuous variation was detected in the production of propionic acid except acidogenesis step the bio process of acetogenesis is another step for hydrogen generation accompanied by the transformation of butyric to acetic acid and the influence of pe mps on this step was evaluated through the yield of acetic acid as shown in fig 4b pe mps restrained the conversions of butyric to acetic acid and the suppressive effect even achieved 27 1 3 4 p 0 0002 at 90 mg l nano size pe mps the impact of pe mps on the hydrogen consuming step was interpreted through hydrogen expenditure and methane production in all assays negligible changes of hydrogen and methane generation were measured indicated that methanogens were almost completely weeded out under acidic i e ph 4 5 condition regardless the presence of pe mps and this phenomenon has been documented in previous publications hernandez mendoza and buitron 2014 yu and mu 2006 as such pe mps showed no impacts on hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis 3 5 effects of pe micro nano plastics on oxidative stress in hpg the levels of oxidative stress induced by pe mps in the four exposure systems were examined by ros measurements as shown in fig 4d the extents of oxidative damage became more severe with the elevated pe mps levels and shrunken particle size of pe mps reflected in 7 4 3 3 19 3 2 1 and 39 8 4 9 p 0 02 0 0002 and 0 0002 increase in ros generations in the three experimental assays of l pe l l pe h and s pe h respectively microbes usually have their own antioxidant defense system to repair trauma caused by moderate external toxicity and prevent further injury functioning through anti oxidants i e sod cat ma et al 2016 additional experimental results suggested that the addition of extra scavengers alleviated excessive ros production to a certain extent besides a mitigatory inhibition could be also indicated in the increased hydrogen production achieving up to 93 1 3 0 86 3 2 7 and 78 9 1 7 p 0 02 0 001 and 7 65e 05 of the control whereas the hydrogen production in tests without any anti oxidants addition was 88 0 3 7 79 9 2 6 and 63 0 3 9 p 0 01 0 001 and 0 0002 of control in l pe l l pe h and s pe h respectively these findings indicated that superfluous ros induced by pe mps had a negative effect on hpg and their performance 3 6 interactions between pe micro nano plastics and hpg to further evaluate the interaction between hpg and pe mps the fluorescent dyeing technique was applied to trace the track of pe micro nano plastics in hpg as such the surface and sectional diagrams of granules derived from the control and experimental reactors l pe h and s pe h were focused for comparison it can observe from fig 5 that a mass of pe mps pe nps adhered and agglomerated on the outside surface of hpg creating direct contact between pe mps pe nps and external cells in hpg fig 5 also clearly demonstrated the distribution of pe mps pe nps in the cross section of hpg as exposure time went on nano size pe nps transferred into inner layer of experimental hpg resulting in more cells faced stress of pe nps directly these direct contacts could induce physical crush and oxidative injury corresponding with the rise of dead cells in the inside and outside of experimental hpg furthermore the cavities in hpg might be clogged by pe nps blocking the transmissive channel of nutrients which might accelerate the disintegration of granules this observation was also supported by the sem images in fig 2b however few pe mps were observed at the periphery of the cross section that because the mature granule had favorable micro pore construction with a medial aperture range from 292 nm to 447 nm wei et al 2020 micro size pe mps might not be able to enter into the core of hpg these results suggested that pe nps at nanoscale could induce stronger inhibition to hpg than pe mps 4 discussion several previous publications reported the impacts of microplastics on biological sewage and sludge treatment systems mostly focusing on the concentration variations of microplastics however the influence of microplastics on the anaerobic hydrogen producing granular sludge relevant to both concentrations and sizes of microplastics has never been studied especially for the difference between micro size and nano size microplastics this work provided a first insight about the adverse influences of pe mps and pe nps on the microbial and physicochemical characteristics of hpg for hydrogen recovery from wastewater in anaerobic fermentation in general hydrogen production is considered as the most intuitive indicator to evaluate the toxicity of contaminants to hpg performance the results indicated that the suppression effect on hydrogen production reached up to 20 1 2 6 p 0 001 with the increase of pe mps concentrations and the hydrogen generation gradually reduced to 63 0 3 9 p 0 0002 of control with the decrease of pe mps size to nanoscale in addition to the hydrogen yield of hpg pe mps also showed negative effects on the microbial metabolism and granule morphology the key bioprocesses of acidogenesis and acetogenesis were restrained irreparably at high level of pe mps demonstrating that both metabolic pathways of acetate type to butyrate type fermentation in hydrogen recovery were destructed severely while the microbes related to these two fermentative pathways were predominant in hydrogen production system wang et al 2018a theoretically butyric acid is the substrate for acetogenesis step li et al 2020 as such the limitation of butyric acid production from acidogenesis process undoubtedly set potential barrier to the following acetogenesis step furthermore the secretion of eps by hpg was also disordered by pe micro nano plastics resulting in the reduced concentrations of proteins polysaccharides lipids and humic acids in eps such suppression was evidenced particularly in proteins and polysaccharides which generally act a crucial role in formation and stabilization of granular sludge mcswain et al 2005 seviour et al 2012 inhibition of eps secretion leaded to the loss of skeleton structure of granule led to decreased capability to perform the function of adhesion and aggregation of cells he et al 2017 mu et al 2012 and thus resulting in the possible disintegration of granules this was also verified by the results of the reduced granule size as well as the crushed morphology from microcosmic investigation cells in granules subjected to nano size pe nps showed more fragile viability and the cytotoxicity induced by pe nps leaded to the release of intracellular dna and the high mortality of cells these results suggested pe micro nano plastics caused performance deterioration particle disintegration and metabolic disturbance of hpg fluorescence tracer technique was thus used to track the location of pe mps in hpg after exposure from granule surface to core in order to reveal the interaction between microplastics and hpg more intuitively unlike pe mps that only adhered to the outer surface of hpg pe nps could also penetrate into the core of granule on the one hand the size of pe nps 50 nm was much smaller than the aperture of hpg which in the range of 292 447 nm wei et al 2020 on the other hand this also might be due to the cracks increment caused by the reduced eps providing more unobstructed channel for the infiltration of pe nps furthermore the agglomerated pe nps might also clog the metabolic channels of hpg wei et al 2020 and enhance the mechanical friction with granule which might accelerate the disintegration of granules feng et al 2020 xu et al 2021 except for the physical crushing the interaction between pe nps and granule also created more opportunities for pe nps to directly contact with cells leading to more cell inside hpg exposure to the toxic micro environment pe mps leachate was revealed to be one of the contributing factors of such toxic micro environment previous studies have affirmed the poisonousness of microplastics was closely related to the leached plastic additives gandara e silva et al 2016 li et al 2016 in this work it was confirmed that the pe mps leachate did pose a certain inhibition to the hydrogen production by hpg fig 1 however there was no obvious relevancy between the inhibition effect and the variation of pe mps sizes and the inhibition effect was weaker than that of direct exposure to pe mps suggesting the contribution from other toxic factor in the toxic micro environment many publications have confirmed that microplastics with micro size around 200 um could trigger excessive ros generation choi et al 2020a yu et al 2021 causing destruction of redox balance and peroxidation of cells choi et al 2018 xia et al 2008 besides a negative correlation between ros levels and particles size of microplastics was also reported by some literatures wang et al 2020 choi et al 2020b with nano size inducing upgraded level of ros homologous results were also verified in this study the other key toxicity contributor induced by pe mps in this work was oxidative stress indicated by ros generation and the contents of ros clearly elevated with the increasing exposure concentrations and the decreasing sizes of pe mps reaching extremum at high concentration of pe nps exposure normally cells have the ability to repair oxidative damage automatically to some extent via enzymatic reactions but this capacity is not inexhaustible because of the limited amount of antioxidant enzymes ma et al 2016 therefore we further demonstrated that adding exogenous ros scavengers i e sod and cat into the hpg mps system can alleviate the toxicity of pe mps effectively strongly evidencing again that ros production induced by pe mps contributed to the overall pe mps inhibition on the hydrogen production by hpg anaerobic fermentation for hydrogen production from wastewater by hpg can effectively combine organic waste disposal and clean energy recovery li et al 2020 pandering to current global development strategies for carbon abatement micro nano plastics pollution is evolving at a rate that threatens ecological environment chen et al 2020 which is now almost ubiquitously existing in wastewater with variable concentrations and sizes however both the microbial and physicochemical responses of hpg to micro nano plastics exposure is still poorly understood which might hinder the application of hpg technology under emerging micro nano plastics stresses this work comprehensively revealed the adverse impacts of pe mps on hpg and this inhibitory effect significantly deepened with the increase of concentration and the decrease of size this study also provided understanding into the potential toxic mechanism of pe mps multidimensionally regarding these malignant consequences notably we demonstrated that the addition of exogenous ros scavengers could mitigate oxidative damage caused by pe mps to some extent similar result was also documented in published literature ma et al 2016 e g augment of sod activity protected cells of earthworm from oxidative stress induced by di n butyl phthalate ma et al 2019 developed a bifunctional single atom based enzyme which could excellently mimic the activities of sod and cat for scavenging superfluous ros in cells this strategy might be useful for controlling the mps inhibition however its practical implication in wastewater treatment needs to be further explored it is looking forward that the findings of this study would be functional for improving the design and operation of hpg systems for hydrogen production under emerging micro nano plastic stresses and potentially alleviating the toxicity of micro nano plastics 5 conclusions this work demonstrated firstly that hydrogen production by hpg was affected by pe mps and this inhibition became more severe with the increasing concentration and decreasing size of pe mps except for deteriorating hydrogen producing performance pe mps exposure also leaded to the disruption of hpg metabolism including eps secretion and biological reactions resulting in the elevation of dead cells in hpg and the progressive disintegration of granule the infiltration of nano size pe nps from outer sphere to inner layer of granule increased the likelihood of cells in hpg directly exposed to toxic micro environments which were favored by the toxic contributors of excessive ros generation and leachates release declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

15737,this publication presents a methodology for the evaluation of the water footprint of urban renewal projects the indirect water footprint is obtained by adding together the embodied or virtual water of the materials incorporated in the 12 month project while the direct footprint is mainly due to the green areas and rainwater collection system over its 40 year life span the methodology originally defined for the agricultural sector is adapted to an urban system that includes gardens and sustainable urban drainage systems in an innovative way the present work analyses the amortisation of the indirect water footprint of the construction products by improvements in the city water cycle the project involves street renewal with water sensitive criteria with five green areas and road and pavement construction the methodology identifies changes in garden designs soil drainage and rainwater collecting systems in terms of blue green and grey water footprints five scenarios of a project in seville spain are studied the indirect water footprint of the project is 2 6 times higher than that in a standard project but due to annual savings of 65 in its direct water footprint the breakeven point is reached in the 10th year graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords suds urban design water footprint renovation urbanisation 1 introduction urban water management systems although increasingly efficient respond to two basic needs one is sanitation which refers to the disposal of used water and the other is the control of flood risks however these systems seldom take other objectives into account in the design processes chocat et al 2001 fletcher et al 2015 one limitation is its linearity in capturing conducting and discharging water as quickly as possible nevertheless a significant environmental improvement is given a circular functional approach where the water is recirculated reused and recycled to this end it is necessary to match the quality of the water to the demands of each use and the water can therefore be recycled or reused multiple times in a cascade process water is first consumed in high quality requirements and through recycling it gradually decreases in quality for uses of less demanding requirements this implies the incorporation of new assets grey water and rainwater to increase the system efficiency and reduce the hydrological impact strategies should be developed to expand rainwater storage capacity use alternative sources decentralise sewer systems infiltrate rainwater into the ground and efficiently manage overflows and runoff ipcc 2013 a new perspective for the improvement of the renewal of urban spaces involves imitation as far as is feasible of the natural water cycle by promoting and conserving natural ecosystems and optimising the use of water resources or urban water sensitive design uwsd this term created in australia mouritz 1996 is being progressively introduced into the design of urban water cycle management since it favours the transition process towards new more sustainable circular economy models lloyd et al 2002 suárez lópez et al 2014 the term water sensitive cities is used in parallel which unlike uwsd which describes the process refers to the destination the objective brown and clarke 2007 several case studies can be found in the literature for example the urban regeneration project in the augustenborg neighbourhood in malmö sweden stands out for its interesting approach it is an area that suffers from seasonal floods and has increased its green space and biodiversity by 50 while its urban drainage system collects 90 of runoff thereby supplying water to an attractive landscape this approach won the 2010 world habitat award from the united nations de santiago rodríguez 2014 other models of architecture and urban environments are addressed in the proposal for the first forest city in liuzhou china the city has offices houses hotels hospitals and schools completely covered by plants and trees of all sizes and functions with 40 000 trees and almost 1 million plants of more than 100 distinct species the design accommodates 30 000 people absorbs 10 000 t of co2 and 57 t of other pollutants per year and produces approximately 900 t of oxygen kucherova and narvaez 2018 other initiatives include the plan of the san francisco public utilities commission sfpuc which implements a series of technological policies aimed to develop a circular economy of water and to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and improve resilience to climate change sfpuc 2020 the e2stotmed project develops a decision support tool to promote improvements in rainwater management and its energy efficiency in six locations benaguasil pisa malta hersonissos centinje zagreb and dronero maira valley lara garcía 2019 moreover in spain urban planning towards a more sustainable water strategy can be found for example in the municipal water demand management plan in madrid the future plan for efficient water management in vitoria gazteiz aguas municipales vitoria gasteiz 2014 and in the aquaval project in xátiva and benaguasil in valencia lara garcía 2019 another example is given by trinitat nova in the barrio del agua barcelona which consists of the rehabilitation of the neighbourhood including gardens permeable pavements green roofs and natural grey water purification and makes the water cycle explicit in the rehabilitation of an old pumping station casa del agua water house the project was presented with the good practices award in 2008 by the united nations un the project of the eco city of sarriguren navarra is equally of interest in 2000 it was also awarded by the un and was presented with the european prize for urbanism in the category of environment and sustainability 2008 the project has an integral approach to the management of the water cycle which includes consumption control strategies separative sanitisation retrieval of runoff water for the thermal regulation of the microclimate regaining aquifers the application of xero gardening and efficient irrigation systems and urban gardens diego díez 2014 metrópoli fundación 2019 certain studies have estimated that measures aimed to conserve water may be sufficient to nullify the impacts of climate change in particularly sensitive regions escriva bou et al 2015 the most effective measure involves distributing solutions strategically in the urban landscape at regular intervals and in areas of high exposure to heat in order to promote infiltration and evapotranspiration and to maintain the health of the trees coutts et al 2013 cities face major transformation to achieve sustainability and it is important to select relevant indicators that can measure sustainability at local project level jomo et al 2019 the innovations can include urban green spaces and models have been defined for the calculation of the water use particularly in private gardens landscape water use among households and businesses has been assessed in utah united sates by means of a classified mosaic of landscape type and area from airborne multispectral digital imagery and the integration of this information in parcel boundary data landscape vegetated areas can be determined per lot and irrigation needs using weather data have been estimated endter wada et al 2008 in a similar way salvador et al 2011 estimated the domestic garden needs in zaragoza spain by employing aerial photographs for the identification of vegetation estimated its water use and compared it to the water billing records overirrigation was common in the three years of study also in spain parés franzi et al 2006 evaluated irrigation performance of 315 urban parks in the barcelona metropolitan region using the wucols approach and concluded that unsustainable park management strategies were mainly due to irrigation designs being based on the water demand of turf grasses more recently a similar analysis has been carried out in santiago chile whereby public and private spaces are included the water use for irrigation was compared with that expected using a hydrological model the monthly water use was obtained from a database of drinking water meters provided by the private water utility the irrigation rate of public spaces is lower than the rate of private spaces and similar to the modelled demand reyes paecke et al 2019 guo et al 2021 determined the water use of china s parks by employing statistical reports nouri et al 2019 evaluated the blue and green water footprint wf of a 10 hectare parkland in adelaide south australia through empirical data evapotranspiration of the urban vegetation was estimated by monitoring soil water inflows outflows and storage changes at an experimental site with varied species microclimates and plant densities in addition to the correct estimation of water needs of the urban green areas for the improvement in their design another strategy involves improving the management of grey water sustainable urban drainage systems suds have been incorporated in the cities under study a systematic review of over 120 papers can be found in ferrans et al 2022 where decision support systems are evaluated they studied how suds are designed built and used by means of modelling multi criteria matrices and optimisation tools furthermore the urban water resources research council of the american society of civil engineers published a database of best practices as well as data entry software for standardised reporting and performance evaluation protocols the data is accessible via the internet at www bmpdatabase org along with associated data evaluation reports and other project documentation clary et al 2002 there is a body of literature on city wf direct and indirect and this work focuses on the scale of urban water redevelopment project the wf is evaluated direct and indirect in terms of the volume of water use and or of contaminated water per unit of time m3 year the term water use refers to the water consumed in irrigation the direct water footprint dwf is divided into blue green and grey water and indirect or virtual water footprint iwf refers to the water embodied in the construction materials employed in urban renovation projects which include green spaces and suds to this end local information on precipitation soil characteristics and greenery microclimate density and species are assessed together with water harvesting for the evaluation of street renovation projects construction cost databases are employed for the resource inventory and the assessment of the iwf in this respect the present study evaluates and adapts the wf indicator to the design analysis of the project in avenida el greco seville spain for the first time in the renovation of streets this innovative project in the city incorporates rainwater collection systems for the maintenance of new gardens the work also analyses the amortisation of the indirect or virtual water of the construction materials used in the project five scenarios of street projects are studied the proposed methodology considers the inputs and outputs of the system limited by the area covered by the street renovation project 1 1 water footprint indicator the first work related to the wf dates back to 1968 when lofting and mcgauhey 1968 calculated volumes of incorporated or embedded water using input output analysis it was not until the early 1990s however that concepts such as water scarcity were developed falkenmark 1989 and j a allan introduced the concept of virtual water which was defined as the volume of water required to produce a given element allan 1998 1994 1993 the concept of wf was created in 2003 by professor arjen y hoekstra of the university of twente netherlands hoekstra 2003 since then several initiatives have emerged such as the water footprint network wfn in 2008 and iso 14 046 in 2014 which includes the concept of wf iso 2014 wfn 2020 its development and standardisation is published in the standard methodology of calculation hoekstra et al 2009 and the manual of water footprint assessment hoekstra et al 2011 this calculation differentiates according to their origin blue water blue wf refers to the consumption of fresh water whether surface or groundwater green water green wf arises from the evaporation and transpiration of plants and grey water grey wf is contaminated water and is defined as the volume of freshwater needed to dilute pollutants and return them back to their natural concentrations and quality standards in the area of study in summary the wf evaluates both direct and indirect water use in terms of the volume of water use and or contaminated per unit of time m3 year the wf is geographically and temporally explicit in terms of the water used by a process product consumer and or producer its definition and systematisation have favoured research in the agricultural and livestock production sectors as a decision making tool for example crop wf estimates have been made at the provincial or national level with explicit spatial data zeng et al 2012 in the agricultural sector in the guadalquivir basin spain salmoral et al 2012 and also in the industrial sector using life cycle analysis lca berger and finkbeiner 2010 furthermore in the construction sector the wf has been adapted to evaluate the built environment it can be analysed from a global perspective chang et al 2016 through an input output analysis of total consumption in the country or models that analyse components of construction projects meng et al 2014 following the component assessment model the virtual water of the construction waste can be calculated marrero et al 2020a as can that of the products consumed in the building life cycle rivero camacho 2020 the urbanisation process has been assessed by employing building information modelling bim marrero et al 2020b and the project budget ruíz pérez 2020 the direct wf due to the building occupants consumption or to city gardens has also been analysed in the work of rivero camacho 2020 ruíz pérez et al 2020 and alba rodríguez et al 2021 2 methodology the calculation methodology for the quantification of the wf in the renovation of urban infrastructure is presented below and considers both the quantity of water required to produce the building material resources indirect water and the water use related to its direct use in the study area irrigation green areas wastewater etc therefore the methodology presented includes various phases of the water cycle extraction and the manufacturing of materials transportation construction and management of municipal services 2 1 direct water footprint dwf calculation the wf is estimated from of its three components differentiated by colour green blue and grey water footprints hoekstra et al 2011 these serve to distinguish water qualities since they are not entirely equal in terms of access usability and quality the blue wf is defined by eq 1 in table 1 where the volume of water that is incorporated and that which evaporates in a process is considered for its calculation a water balance is proposed eq 2 in table 1 since in most cases no exact data of the evaporation volume is available the grey footprint is determined by eq 3 in table 1 water pollution is a consequence of human activities that alter the quality of water thereby affecting the viability of its consumption the quality standard of the pollutant concentration is defined by the legislation in place in the region of analysis which applies a degree of protection about subsequent uses cmax or its ecological function according to the intended destination receiving water body cnat depending on where the discharge is located for the calculation of the footprint of grey water the assimilation capacity of the receiving stream is considered regardless of whether the concentration quality standards have been exceeded when there are several pollutants the grey footprint of the most significant pollutant is considered wfn 2020 in spanish legislation royal decree 849 1986 regulates the management and control of the hydraulic public domain and hydrological planning and establishes environmental quality standards the limits of natural concentrations in seville can be found in the reports of the saica network of the guadalquivir hydrological plan rd 849 1986 the total wf of the green areas is obtained from the blue green and grey components produced by the green areas during their growth hoekstra et al 2011 in the specific urban system to be studied consisting of a street and its gardens three categories of inputs and outputs are considered blue water consumed from the urban water supply system and output through percolation grey water through the urban sewer system and green water or direct inputs from the rain and output via evaporation and the transpiration of plants in order to determine all the system flows and their corresponding footprints the methodology is sequenced into four phases 1 study of the runoff 2 study of the soil 3 calculation of the garden water demands and 4 the balance of the system to estimate its irrigation efficiency or in situ reuse for the first phase it is necessary to quantify the rainfall the local climate can be found in the fao food and agriculture organization of the united nations databases cropwat 2018 but data on the total monthly precipitation cannot be used since not all the rainfall is usable the concept of effective precipitation is therefore introduced which considers three scenarios very heavy rain whereby some of the water percolates to a great depth and is not stored at root level heavy rain whereby not all the rainwater is absorbed by the soil and creates a runoff and finally the light rainfall which evaporates at ground level for the calculation of the effective rainfall the simple curve number cn method of the united states department of agriculture usda scs p soil conservation service natural resources conservation service nrcs 2004 can be used this method applies a reduction factor which considers different precipitation intervals for 24 h rainfall and runoff records and hence fails to explicitly consider the temporal variation of runoff the runoff study analyses the behaviour of the local rainfall regime for this purpose effective and abstract or absorbed rainfall is determined using the equations from 4 to 8 in table 2 surfaces are classified according to their permeability and are assigned a runoff coefficient woodward and posey 1955 which determines the volume abstracted retained in permeable areas and the runoff from impermeable surfaces which drains into the sewer system the equations are defined in table 2 eqs 4 and 5 in the second phase the permeability or infiltration of the soil both natural and improved by the project is analysed first the volume of rainwater is calculated using the rational method in instruction 5 2 ic surface drainage of the ministry of public works fom 298 2016 the infiltration efficiency managed by the sustainable urban drainage system suds is obtained via eq 9 in table 2 and the volumes of water infiltrated into the soil are compared with the volumes of runoff water collected at 5 min intervals over one hour with a rainfall intensity calculated for a 10 year breakeven point to this end the suds design considers a rain period of 10 years since longer periods can overextend the suds design the performance or infiltration ability depends to a significant extent on the permeability of the soil and the optimal is reached when the quantity of precipitated water equals the capacity of infiltration of the soil which implies that larger infiltration surfaces are needed during periods of intense rain the design of the infiltration profile of the suds is obtained for seville fig 1 for a 10 year period and 5 min intervals are used a moderate rainfall intensity 15 to 60 mm h results in 85 efficiency eq 10 of table 2 calculates the infiltration volume managed by the suds the volume is temporarily stored in locally built tanks if its maximum capacity is reached then the overflow is sent to the sewer network in the third phase the impact of green areas is determined using a crop coefficient similar to that used in agriculture hoekstra 2019 but in this case it is called the garden coefficient which takes into account the areas covered by different species the composition of the areas and the location within the project all this together with the local climate determines the water demand it has been proposed that those green areas defined as hydro zones that have similar water needs be grouped under the same coefficient ruíz pérez et al 2020 the water demand of plants otherwise known as the evapotranspiration of green areas is quantified using the method proposed by the fao doorenbos and pruitt 1977 the evapotranspiration reference values eto have been calculated using the penman monteith method which is an accepted method for the estimation of the evapotranspiration of crops since it can be used without restrictions in all types of climates souza et al 2014 the coefficients are obtained from the cropwat program developed by the fao cropwat 2018 however this database does not contain information pertaining to all crops nor is it valid for gardens due to three major differences first gardens and green areas are composed of more than one species and within the same garden area the different types of species are arranged at different heights trees shrubs and ground cover plants without any predominance of one over another each with its own irrigation needs secondly the density of vegetation is also heterogeneous in all areas with more water losses occurring in certain areas than in others especially in areas with no vegetation where soil evaporation is increased ad thirdly differences arise due to the microclimate effect from the shadows of building paved areas traffic etc the method of the garden coefficient or hydro zone cg is proposed together with that of the garden evapotranspiration etg ruíz pérez et al 2020 to take into account all the urban characteristics finally the species factor fs considers the climatic zone under study because water requirements of species can vary with temperature contreras et al 2006 eqs 11 to 15 of table 2 in the fourth and final phase of the methodology the irrigation network is analysed since the volume of abstractions is insufficient to cover the garden demand this can be supplied by tap water or from underground tanks of rainwater collected by the suds see eqs 11 and 12 in table 2 in order to consider the efficiency of the irrigation system eqs 14 to 18 of table 3 are applied finally the garden s wf is composed of three footprints green for abstractions eq 19 blue for irrigation eq 20 and grey for irrigation and rainwater surplus that cannot be stored eq 21 all these are outlined in table 3 fig 2 illustrates the flow diagram for the calculation of the three footprints 2 2 calculation of the indirect water footprint iwf the methodology for the calculation of the iwf uses the resources inventory that can be found in the documents that control the costs of construction projects that is the bill of quantities and construction cost databases for the temporal boundary the impact is concentrated during the months that the construction takes place as defined in the project planning the project blueprints outline the physical boundaries of the activities taking place and the results are expressed either per lot area in square metres for comparison to other previous work on construction project assessment freire guerrero et al 2019 rivero camacho and marrero 2022 or per hectare to compare with gardening projects nouri et al 2019 salvador et al 2011 the environmental impact of the resources consumed is based on lca obtained from international databases of construction products martínez rocamora et al 2016 which includes the water required during the life cycle from cradle to factory gate material transport and commissioning impact are also calculated for the resources inventory the accd andalusia construction cost database is employed ramírez de arellano agudo 2010 fig 3 shows an example of a unit cost uc that forms part of chapter 15 on urbanisation the uc is formed with the combination of basic costs bc such as materials machinery and labour or with the combination of bc with auxiliary costs ac whereby the latter are combinations of bc commonly employed in construction that do not form a construction unit by themselves and hence are not complex enough to be considered a uc in the example given in the figure below the mortar is an auxiliary cost agm90200 which is formed of other bcs tp00100 gw00100 and gc00200 see fig 3 thanks to this hierarchical classification it is possible to incorporate the environmental impact of all elements in the project by multiplying their quantities by the unit impact in the case of machinery the average fuel consumption differentiating between diesel and petrol per hour worked by machinery is obtained by eq 22 see table 4 the average consumption of each construction machine is calculated by employing the conversion factor for the volume of water needed to provide one kg of fuel this factor is extracted from the open database ecoinvent frischknecht et al 2005 table 4 eq 23 for electric machines the water necessary for the production of one kwh by the spanish electric mix ree 2014 is used table 4 eq 24 once the unit value of one hour of machine consumption is defined it is then multiplied by the project quantities qi or the time the machine is used at work and hence the total wf of the machine is obtained table 4 eq 25 for the wf of construction materials or of its bc the first step is to change its unit of measurement at the origin m3 m2 metres tons thousands of bricks etc into kg see fig 3 for calculation details table 4 eq 26 the density is obtained from the construction solutions of the technical building code csc and the basic document of structural safety which both form part of the technical building code tbc building actions db se ae tbc 2006 environmental families have been defined from the lca database by distributing each bc per similarity environmental families refer to groups of construction material that have the same origin in terms of raw materials that way the over 300 products in the urbanisation project can be grouped into categories or families in order to assign the lca data freire guerrero et al 2019 rivero camacho and marrero 2022 in the life cycle inventory for each of the materials the water footprint network wfn is the reference framework for the calculation of the wf a concept introduced by hoekstra 2003 and the calculation methodology used is that developed in the standard calculation methodology and the water footprint assessment manual hoekstra et al 2011 this makes it possible to obtain the water use of any production process expressed in the volume of water consumed m3 kg table 4 eq 27 once each uc in the project has been obtained the project quantities qi or the quantities consumed on site see fig 3 budget quantities are then applied and the total wf of the construction materials is obtained table 4 eq 28 3 case study the calculation methodology is applied to an urban renewal project in seville spain which covers an area of 11 441 m2 and corresponds to the complete layout of a street the project is developed by the metropolitan water supply and sewer company of seville empresa metropolitana de abastecimiento y saneamiento de aguas de sevilla s a emasesa a public enterprise dedicated to the management of the urban water cycle in fig 4 the new garden characteristics are represented by colour each different group of plants is part of a defined hydro zone furthermore each hydro zone has factors for species density and microclimate corrections whereby the product of the three factors is the hydro zone coefficient ruíz pérez et al 2020 fig 5 presents the ten hydro zones in the garden the rain patterns and water necessities the analysis is based on the ceteris paribus approach to characterise the level of influence of each variable four categories are defined in accordance with two design parameters the incorporation of green areas into the urban space and the use of a suds table 5 each category is hereinafter referred to as the scenario 4 results and discussion 4 1 direct water footprint dwf the dwf calculation is applied to the scenarios described starting with the initial case s1 using the data input the flow of the suds and the natural system is analysed and the outputs are obtained for the initial state the street is divided into four areas first the north pavement fig 4 empties into the drainage ditch located between the bike lane and the road formed by the permeable surface parking lots and the filter strip second the south pavement empties into the ditch located between the roadway and the pavement whereby both areas discharge into tank 1 similarly the eastern zone is subdivided into two areas that discharge into tank 2 the runoff coefficients ci the average annual effective precipitation and the two generating surfaces runoff sr and loss or abstraction sab are described in table 1 of the appendix and the corresponding volume is calculated in table 2 of the appendix the soil permeability is 3 3 10 4 cm s according to the spanish geological mining institute database instituto geológico minero de españa s f the suds manages the 85th percentile runoff volume as defined in fig 1 for the calculation of infiltrations the project proposes two scenarios first the rainfall regime ranges between light to moderate and highly intense and runoff is retained in the suds and infiltrated in less than 48 h and second runoff cannot infiltrate and runs into the tank during very heavy rainfall according to aemet 2015 see table 3 in the appendix the concept of filtration surface sf is used in an analogous way to that of a runoff generating surface and the coefficient of performance of the suds is applied the outputs of the suds table 4 in appendix are obtained by direct infiltration to the ground vin and the water stored in the gravel layer vssuds subsequently part of the water infiltrates into the ground and the rest is stored in the tanks vstank in fig 6 all volumes are expressed in m3 and the percentages are calculated with respect to the green or blue input volume the input and output volumes of each scenario were evaluated thereby obtaining the dwf table 6 in terms of total volumes for one year and per component of the wf in systems without green areas s2 and s4 if the surfaces are impermeable as in s2 then the system is designed to quickly evacuate a large volume of rainwater resulting in more runoff however if a suds is introduced even if green areas are not present as in s4 the disconnection of impermeable surfaces from the sewer network significantly reduces the volume to be evacuated 67 furthermore at peak flow water is laminated and less runoff occurs in the process the water that infiltrates the ground generates the recharge of the underground aquifer and recovers part of the natural cycle thereby reducing discharges and overloads of the city s sewer systems however the volume of water poured into the sewer network during periods of torrential rainfall is extremely high 89 this could be reduced by increasing the storage capacity of the system with bigger tanks in this case however the limited public space available in the street margins renders this option infeasible in the presence of green areas s1 and s5 or water consuming areas and suds the volume to be evacuated is reduced 72 as compared to the solution that fails to implement any water sensitive design in addition the decrease is most noticeable during rainy seasons whereby peak flows are reduced during storm events and the seasonal variation of runoff water that is to be managed is also reduced the volume infiltrated by the suds accounts for 32 of the total rain s4 s1 and s5 a design based strategy for the maximisation of the use of water collected from rainfall has been employed to achieve a 50 reduction of freshwater demand the project alternates hydro zones with different necessities and with this system it is possible to distribute the available rainwater by compensating the surplus of the autochthonous species with the high water requirements of ornamental species this is achieved with an irrigation system adapted and automated for each area thus reducing the blue and grey footprint gardened soils lose nutrients and for this reason they must be periodically replenished in the case where organic fertilisers are employed the grey footprint caused by diffuse contamination s1 can be disregarded however the use of industrial synthetic chemicals in fertilisers or pesticides produces pollutants in the drainage water s5 the grey wf concept is applied in which the volume of water for the dilution of contaminants necessary to return water to its natural quality is determined this increases the grey wf by 800 hence the importance of applying organic fertilisers which also exert a positive influence on the structure of the soil bronick and lal 2005 organic fertilisers additionally provide nutrients and modify the population of microorganisms thereby ensuring greater water retention and the exchange of gases and nutrients at the level of the roots of the plants furthermore the generic nutrient pollutant balance raises awareness regarding the quality of the water that is discharged out of the urban system treatment technologies such as biological chemical physical processes are not included since those processes take place outside the boundaries of the urbanisation project in the case study the grey water of the street goes to ranilla treatment plant an anaerobic anoxic aerobic system of activated sludge this plant is equipped with tertiary treatment for the removal of nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus the water is returned to the river at natural concentration levels that is without grey wf the blue wf in the present work is 9740 m3 per hectare in s1 which is slightly lower than 11 140 m3 ha per year found by nouri et al 2019 they estimate the blue and green wf of a 10 hectare parkland in adelaide south australia the main differences can be due to the vegetation species and the density of the garden because the seville case study consists of a street with side gardens similar results are found in china the urban green space water use per statistical data in southern and northern cities is 12 570 ha and 6380 m3 ha respectively guo et al 2021 moreover similar results are found in endter wada et al 2008 whose ceiling threshold results regarding the water use of gardens are 8430 m3 ha for residential gardens and 10 620 m3 ha for business 4 2 indirect water footprint iwf the impact on the water footprint by the materials incorporated into the work has been evaluated following the methodology of iwf for this calculation the urban area of intervention corresponds to the area of the street including pavements roads and gardens see table 7 it was revealed that 41 of the impact is due to concrete and cement followed by 35 to aggregates and stones and 12 to ceramics and bricks the prefabricated concrete and slabs for wells and storm tank foundations are more relevant in s2 and s4 while the inclusion of reinforced concrete cisterns is relevant in s1 s3 and s5 where the drainage systems reduce the consumption of prefabricated elements in the storm drainage system the integral renovation of the street and the provision of improved soil that enables the drainage and filtering of rainwater to be reused for street irrigation makes the family of aggregates and stones a critical material for s1 s4 and s5 whereas for conventional solutions s2 these materials exert less impact at the same time the systems involving the levelling of land and the urban furniture mean that metals and alloys together with the pvc pipes used in the drainage system also constitute major families of materials in projects with a suds s1 s4 and s5 the materials with the highest impact are fresh concrete and prefabricated concrete parts refill soil metallic tubes and ceramic pipes in the southern part of the city of calcutta india bardhan 2011 measured the virtual water of the construction of a multi storied residential apartment building of steel and reinforced concrete as 27 m3 m2 of floor area in a similar way based on the project data in the bill of quantities six landmark buildings in e town beijing had a total virtual water of 20 83 m3 m2 of floor area meng et al 2014 also in beijing han et al 2016 determined the total virtual water of another nine projects to have an intensity of 26 5 m3 per m2 of floor area in tehran the virtual water of six residential buildings was 18 76 m3 per m2 of floor area heravi and abdolvand 2019 furthermore the wf of the building life cycle was also determined of a social housing project in huelva spain whereby 27 m3 per m2 of floor area was revealed in their life cycle rivero camacho and marrero 2022 moreover the virtual water of urbanisation projects has been calculated at 2 70 7 25 m3 m2 ruiz et al 2021 which is a lower range than in the present work of 6 11 8 m3 m2 this is due to the complexity of the projects those that include only the street and the utilities installed or other services such as gardens and playgrounds 4 3 global wf of the service life cycle urbanisations such as residential buildings and infrastructures have a life expectancy that is determined by material deterioration and or obsolescence planners in spain refer to appendix iii of the royal decree 1492 2011 of 24 october which passed the law for the regulation of valuations of land rd 1492 2011 it states that roads open air car parks and similar infrastructures have a life expectancy of 40 years however these durations may vary according to the materials used the maintenance and their functionality or obsolescence in table 8 the dwf and iwf are added together for a 40 year period although the iwf of the project with water sensitive urban design s1 is 2 6 times higher than that of a standard project s2 the total dwf over its entire life cycle is 43 5 less due to the annual savings of 65 the breakeven point 9 65 m3 is reached in the 10th year when separative rainwater management s4 is applied the most important iwf is due to the earth works required for the new drainage and infiltration system although with the absence of vegetation the dwf is low as for the incorporation of green areas and irrigation without a suds s3 dwf increases finally the use of chemical fertilisers which are not environmentally friendly incorporates a grey footprint which triggers the annual dwf and nullifies all the efforts made even though the combination of the three footprints green blue and grey mixes different natures this better represents the urban system where water is transformed when it enters and leaves the system or urban project for example blue water becomes grey water when the irrigation surplus is sent to the sewer system and green water turns grey when the rain cannot be stored in tanks for the irrigation of the garden and green water turns into blue water when infiltrated in the soil other authors combine these footprints as modelled by hoekstra 2019 for blue and green water by ridoutt et al 2012 and blue and grey water by penru et al 2016 as identified by mubako 2018 in a review of 70 publications three approaches can be found to model blue green and grey water wf assessment lca and a combination of the two there is a discussion as to whether the components blue green and grey wf shall be added in a single indicator mixing different elements and processes or need to be analysed separately garrido et al 2010 garrido colmenero and willaarts 2011 in the present work the discussion is done separately the project which includes suds in its design s4 but not a garden reduces the grey wf by half with respect to the original design s2 the same happens with the design that has vegetation and suds s1 with respect to the same project without suds s3 and as expected the blue wf is also increased in the last the uncertainty involved in the calculation of dwf regarding the rainfall data remains low because local data is available the soil permeability is also local as is the evaluation of the microclimate and the garden characteristics however the amount of water needed by the greenery eto is of high uncertainty because local and empirical data is unavailable and information pertaining to other sites is used instead contreras et al 2006 costello and jones 2000 nevertheless those sites do enjoy similarities to the weather of seville the iwf calculation has high uncertainty since project specific data has not been employed due to the lack of specification of the brands in the budget and generic lca information is therefore employed 5 conclusion the direct water footprints dwf of blue green and grey water have been assessed as have the indirect or virtual water footprint iwf of urban renovation projects which include green spaces and suds to this end local information on precipitation soil characteristics and greenery microclimate density and species are assessed together with water harvesting construction cost databases are employed for the inventory of resources and the assessment of the iwf the water footprint wf of an urbanisation project in the city of seville is evaluated in full the projects involve the incorporation of new gardens playgrounds street paving and new pavements together with all urban installations such as lighting water supply and sewer systems the traditional impermeable pavement is reduced and replaced by a suds that allows rainwater to be harvested and reused by efficient irrigation systems that are adapted to the demand of the plant species in each area thereby reducing water use five scenarios are evaluated the methodology is sensitive to changes in the gardens suds and fertilisers this new approach can promote the water cycle through coexistence between natural and fabricated drainage and green areas as regards the footprint obtained in incorporating building materials iwf concrete aggregates and stone control the environmental impact stones and aggregates are used in the implementation of suds for the improvement of the land under the permeable surfaces to promote the infiltration transport and storage of rainwater there is also an opportunity to replace these materials with recycled aggregates thereby further reducing the impact another major aspect in the assessment involves the availability of information for the calculations and the degree of confidence in the data used for this study data has been obtained from accessible databases and inventories although it is generic and needs to be replaced in the future by sources of a more reliable and or more specific nature such as environmental declarations of the products consumed in the project the dwf of the built environment has been calculated by adapting the indicator developed by hoekstra and others the hydric balance of an urban system is explored for the first time which includes the street pavements its gardens playgrounds and suds for the calculations local data is employed for rain infiltration and weather but no specific geographical information is available for the calculation of the water needed by the greenery the methodology enables project designs to be differentiated in terms of their footprint the results maximise the importance of the water quality that exits the urban system by the calculation of the grey water as the dissolution necessary to restore its quality the methodology also combines and transforms green and blue input water into a single indicator the iwf of the project is 2 6 times higher than that in a standard project but due to annual savings of 65 in its dwf the breakeven point is reached in the 10th year future work will consider the influence of climate projections in terms of temperature and precipitation which are marked by the trends in climate change to study the vulnerability of various gardens and of sustainable urban drainage systems

15737,this publication presents a methodology for the evaluation of the water footprint of urban renewal projects the indirect water footprint is obtained by adding together the embodied or virtual water of the materials incorporated in the 12 month project while the direct footprint is mainly due to the green areas and rainwater collection system over its 40 year life span the methodology originally defined for the agricultural sector is adapted to an urban system that includes gardens and sustainable urban drainage systems in an innovative way the present work analyses the amortisation of the indirect water footprint of the construction products by improvements in the city water cycle the project involves street renewal with water sensitive criteria with five green areas and road and pavement construction the methodology identifies changes in garden designs soil drainage and rainwater collecting systems in terms of blue green and grey water footprints five scenarios of a project in seville spain are studied the indirect water footprint of the project is 2 6 times higher than that in a standard project but due to annual savings of 65 in its direct water footprint the breakeven point is reached in the 10th year graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords suds urban design water footprint renovation urbanisation 1 introduction urban water management systems although increasingly efficient respond to two basic needs one is sanitation which refers to the disposal of used water and the other is the control of flood risks however these systems seldom take other objectives into account in the design processes chocat et al 2001 fletcher et al 2015 one limitation is its linearity in capturing conducting and discharging water as quickly as possible nevertheless a significant environmental improvement is given a circular functional approach where the water is recirculated reused and recycled to this end it is necessary to match the quality of the water to the demands of each use and the water can therefore be recycled or reused multiple times in a cascade process water is first consumed in high quality requirements and through recycling it gradually decreases in quality for uses of less demanding requirements this implies the incorporation of new assets grey water and rainwater to increase the system efficiency and reduce the hydrological impact strategies should be developed to expand rainwater storage capacity use alternative sources decentralise sewer systems infiltrate rainwater into the ground and efficiently manage overflows and runoff ipcc 2013 a new perspective for the improvement of the renewal of urban spaces involves imitation as far as is feasible of the natural water cycle by promoting and conserving natural ecosystems and optimising the use of water resources or urban water sensitive design uwsd this term created in australia mouritz 1996 is being progressively introduced into the design of urban water cycle management since it favours the transition process towards new more sustainable circular economy models lloyd et al 2002 suárez lópez et al 2014 the term water sensitive cities is used in parallel which unlike uwsd which describes the process refers to the destination the objective brown and clarke 2007 several case studies can be found in the literature for example the urban regeneration project in the augustenborg neighbourhood in malmö sweden stands out for its interesting approach it is an area that suffers from seasonal floods and has increased its green space and biodiversity by 50 while its urban drainage system collects 90 of runoff thereby supplying water to an attractive landscape this approach won the 2010 world habitat award from the united nations de santiago rodríguez 2014 other models of architecture and urban environments are addressed in the proposal for the first forest city in liuzhou china the city has offices houses hotels hospitals and schools completely covered by plants and trees of all sizes and functions with 40 000 trees and almost 1 million plants of more than 100 distinct species the design accommodates 30 000 people absorbs 10 000 t of co2 and 57 t of other pollutants per year and produces approximately 900 t of oxygen kucherova and narvaez 2018 other initiatives include the plan of the san francisco public utilities commission sfpuc which implements a series of technological policies aimed to develop a circular economy of water and to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and improve resilience to climate change sfpuc 2020 the e2stotmed project develops a decision support tool to promote improvements in rainwater management and its energy efficiency in six locations benaguasil pisa malta hersonissos centinje zagreb and dronero maira valley lara garcía 2019 moreover in spain urban planning towards a more sustainable water strategy can be found for example in the municipal water demand management plan in madrid the future plan for efficient water management in vitoria gazteiz aguas municipales vitoria gasteiz 2014 and in the aquaval project in xátiva and benaguasil in valencia lara garcía 2019 another example is given by trinitat nova in the barrio del agua barcelona which consists of the rehabilitation of the neighbourhood including gardens permeable pavements green roofs and natural grey water purification and makes the water cycle explicit in the rehabilitation of an old pumping station casa del agua water house the project was presented with the good practices award in 2008 by the united nations un the project of the eco city of sarriguren navarra is equally of interest in 2000 it was also awarded by the un and was presented with the european prize for urbanism in the category of environment and sustainability 2008 the project has an integral approach to the management of the water cycle which includes consumption control strategies separative sanitisation retrieval of runoff water for the thermal regulation of the microclimate regaining aquifers the application of xero gardening and efficient irrigation systems and urban gardens diego díez 2014 metrópoli fundación 2019 certain studies have estimated that measures aimed to conserve water may be sufficient to nullify the impacts of climate change in particularly sensitive regions escriva bou et al 2015 the most effective measure involves distributing solutions strategically in the urban landscape at regular intervals and in areas of high exposure to heat in order to promote infiltration and evapotranspiration and to maintain the health of the trees coutts et al 2013 cities face major transformation to achieve sustainability and it is important to select relevant indicators that can measure sustainability at local project level jomo et al 2019 the innovations can include urban green spaces and models have been defined for the calculation of the water use particularly in private gardens landscape water use among households and businesses has been assessed in utah united sates by means of a classified mosaic of landscape type and area from airborne multispectral digital imagery and the integration of this information in parcel boundary data landscape vegetated areas can be determined per lot and irrigation needs using weather data have been estimated endter wada et al 2008 in a similar way salvador et al 2011 estimated the domestic garden needs in zaragoza spain by employing aerial photographs for the identification of vegetation estimated its water use and compared it to the water billing records overirrigation was common in the three years of study also in spain parés franzi et al 2006 evaluated irrigation performance of 315 urban parks in the barcelona metropolitan region using the wucols approach and concluded that unsustainable park management strategies were mainly due to irrigation designs being based on the water demand of turf grasses more recently a similar analysis has been carried out in santiago chile whereby public and private spaces are included the water use for irrigation was compared with that expected using a hydrological model the monthly water use was obtained from a database of drinking water meters provided by the private water utility the irrigation rate of public spaces is lower than the rate of private spaces and similar to the modelled demand reyes paecke et al 2019 guo et al 2021 determined the water use of china s parks by employing statistical reports nouri et al 2019 evaluated the blue and green water footprint wf of a 10 hectare parkland in adelaide south australia through empirical data evapotranspiration of the urban vegetation was estimated by monitoring soil water inflows outflows and storage changes at an experimental site with varied species microclimates and plant densities in addition to the correct estimation of water needs of the urban green areas for the improvement in their design another strategy involves improving the management of grey water sustainable urban drainage systems suds have been incorporated in the cities under study a systematic review of over 120 papers can be found in ferrans et al 2022 where decision support systems are evaluated they studied how suds are designed built and used by means of modelling multi criteria matrices and optimisation tools furthermore the urban water resources research council of the american society of civil engineers published a database of best practices as well as data entry software for standardised reporting and performance evaluation protocols the data is accessible via the internet at www bmpdatabase org along with associated data evaluation reports and other project documentation clary et al 2002 there is a body of literature on city wf direct and indirect and this work focuses on the scale of urban water redevelopment project the wf is evaluated direct and indirect in terms of the volume of water use and or of contaminated water per unit of time m3 year the term water use refers to the water consumed in irrigation the direct water footprint dwf is divided into blue green and grey water and indirect or virtual water footprint iwf refers to the water embodied in the construction materials employed in urban renovation projects which include green spaces and suds to this end local information on precipitation soil characteristics and greenery microclimate density and species are assessed together with water harvesting for the evaluation of street renovation projects construction cost databases are employed for the resource inventory and the assessment of the iwf in this respect the present study evaluates and adapts the wf indicator to the design analysis of the project in avenida el greco seville spain for the first time in the renovation of streets this innovative project in the city incorporates rainwater collection systems for the maintenance of new gardens the work also analyses the amortisation of the indirect or virtual water of the construction materials used in the project five scenarios of street projects are studied the proposed methodology considers the inputs and outputs of the system limited by the area covered by the street renovation project 1 1 water footprint indicator the first work related to the wf dates back to 1968 when lofting and mcgauhey 1968 calculated volumes of incorporated or embedded water using input output analysis it was not until the early 1990s however that concepts such as water scarcity were developed falkenmark 1989 and j a allan introduced the concept of virtual water which was defined as the volume of water required to produce a given element allan 1998 1994 1993 the concept of wf was created in 2003 by professor arjen y hoekstra of the university of twente netherlands hoekstra 2003 since then several initiatives have emerged such as the water footprint network wfn in 2008 and iso 14 046 in 2014 which includes the concept of wf iso 2014 wfn 2020 its development and standardisation is published in the standard methodology of calculation hoekstra et al 2009 and the manual of water footprint assessment hoekstra et al 2011 this calculation differentiates according to their origin blue water blue wf refers to the consumption of fresh water whether surface or groundwater green water green wf arises from the evaporation and transpiration of plants and grey water grey wf is contaminated water and is defined as the volume of freshwater needed to dilute pollutants and return them back to their natural concentrations and quality standards in the area of study in summary the wf evaluates both direct and indirect water use in terms of the volume of water use and or contaminated per unit of time m3 year the wf is geographically and temporally explicit in terms of the water used by a process product consumer and or producer its definition and systematisation have favoured research in the agricultural and livestock production sectors as a decision making tool for example crop wf estimates have been made at the provincial or national level with explicit spatial data zeng et al 2012 in the agricultural sector in the guadalquivir basin spain salmoral et al 2012 and also in the industrial sector using life cycle analysis lca berger and finkbeiner 2010 furthermore in the construction sector the wf has been adapted to evaluate the built environment it can be analysed from a global perspective chang et al 2016 through an input output analysis of total consumption in the country or models that analyse components of construction projects meng et al 2014 following the component assessment model the virtual water of the construction waste can be calculated marrero et al 2020a as can that of the products consumed in the building life cycle rivero camacho 2020 the urbanisation process has been assessed by employing building information modelling bim marrero et al 2020b and the project budget ruíz pérez 2020 the direct wf due to the building occupants consumption or to city gardens has also been analysed in the work of rivero camacho 2020 ruíz pérez et al 2020 and alba rodríguez et al 2021 2 methodology the calculation methodology for the quantification of the wf in the renovation of urban infrastructure is presented below and considers both the quantity of water required to produce the building material resources indirect water and the water use related to its direct use in the study area irrigation green areas wastewater etc therefore the methodology presented includes various phases of the water cycle extraction and the manufacturing of materials transportation construction and management of municipal services 2 1 direct water footprint dwf calculation the wf is estimated from of its three components differentiated by colour green blue and grey water footprints hoekstra et al 2011 these serve to distinguish water qualities since they are not entirely equal in terms of access usability and quality the blue wf is defined by eq 1 in table 1 where the volume of water that is incorporated and that which evaporates in a process is considered for its calculation a water balance is proposed eq 2 in table 1 since in most cases no exact data of the evaporation volume is available the grey footprint is determined by eq 3 in table 1 water pollution is a consequence of human activities that alter the quality of water thereby affecting the viability of its consumption the quality standard of the pollutant concentration is defined by the legislation in place in the region of analysis which applies a degree of protection about subsequent uses cmax or its ecological function according to the intended destination receiving water body cnat depending on where the discharge is located for the calculation of the footprint of grey water the assimilation capacity of the receiving stream is considered regardless of whether the concentration quality standards have been exceeded when there are several pollutants the grey footprint of the most significant pollutant is considered wfn 2020 in spanish legislation royal decree 849 1986 regulates the management and control of the hydraulic public domain and hydrological planning and establishes environmental quality standards the limits of natural concentrations in seville can be found in the reports of the saica network of the guadalquivir hydrological plan rd 849 1986 the total wf of the green areas is obtained from the blue green and grey components produced by the green areas during their growth hoekstra et al 2011 in the specific urban system to be studied consisting of a street and its gardens three categories of inputs and outputs are considered blue water consumed from the urban water supply system and output through percolation grey water through the urban sewer system and green water or direct inputs from the rain and output via evaporation and the transpiration of plants in order to determine all the system flows and their corresponding footprints the methodology is sequenced into four phases 1 study of the runoff 2 study of the soil 3 calculation of the garden water demands and 4 the balance of the system to estimate its irrigation efficiency or in situ reuse for the first phase it is necessary to quantify the rainfall the local climate can be found in the fao food and agriculture organization of the united nations databases cropwat 2018 but data on the total monthly precipitation cannot be used since not all the rainfall is usable the concept of effective precipitation is therefore introduced which considers three scenarios very heavy rain whereby some of the water percolates to a great depth and is not stored at root level heavy rain whereby not all the rainwater is absorbed by the soil and creates a runoff and finally the light rainfall which evaporates at ground level for the calculation of the effective rainfall the simple curve number cn method of the united states department of agriculture usda scs p soil conservation service natural resources conservation service nrcs 2004 can be used this method applies a reduction factor which considers different precipitation intervals for 24 h rainfall and runoff records and hence fails to explicitly consider the temporal variation of runoff the runoff study analyses the behaviour of the local rainfall regime for this purpose effective and abstract or absorbed rainfall is determined using the equations from 4 to 8 in table 2 surfaces are classified according to their permeability and are assigned a runoff coefficient woodward and posey 1955 which determines the volume abstracted retained in permeable areas and the runoff from impermeable surfaces which drains into the sewer system the equations are defined in table 2 eqs 4 and 5 in the second phase the permeability or infiltration of the soil both natural and improved by the project is analysed first the volume of rainwater is calculated using the rational method in instruction 5 2 ic surface drainage of the ministry of public works fom 298 2016 the infiltration efficiency managed by the sustainable urban drainage system suds is obtained via eq 9 in table 2 and the volumes of water infiltrated into the soil are compared with the volumes of runoff water collected at 5 min intervals over one hour with a rainfall intensity calculated for a 10 year breakeven point to this end the suds design considers a rain period of 10 years since longer periods can overextend the suds design the performance or infiltration ability depends to a significant extent on the permeability of the soil and the optimal is reached when the quantity of precipitated water equals the capacity of infiltration of the soil which implies that larger infiltration surfaces are needed during periods of intense rain the design of the infiltration profile of the suds is obtained for seville fig 1 for a 10 year period and 5 min intervals are used a moderate rainfall intensity 15 to 60 mm h results in 85 efficiency eq 10 of table 2 calculates the infiltration volume managed by the suds the volume is temporarily stored in locally built tanks if its maximum capacity is reached then the overflow is sent to the sewer network in the third phase the impact of green areas is determined using a crop coefficient similar to that used in agriculture hoekstra 2019 but in this case it is called the garden coefficient which takes into account the areas covered by different species the composition of the areas and the location within the project all this together with the local climate determines the water demand it has been proposed that those green areas defined as hydro zones that have similar water needs be grouped under the same coefficient ruíz pérez et al 2020 the water demand of plants otherwise known as the evapotranspiration of green areas is quantified using the method proposed by the fao doorenbos and pruitt 1977 the evapotranspiration reference values eto have been calculated using the penman monteith method which is an accepted method for the estimation of the evapotranspiration of crops since it can be used without restrictions in all types of climates souza et al 2014 the coefficients are obtained from the cropwat program developed by the fao cropwat 2018 however this database does not contain information pertaining to all crops nor is it valid for gardens due to three major differences first gardens and green areas are composed of more than one species and within the same garden area the different types of species are arranged at different heights trees shrubs and ground cover plants without any predominance of one over another each with its own irrigation needs secondly the density of vegetation is also heterogeneous in all areas with more water losses occurring in certain areas than in others especially in areas with no vegetation where soil evaporation is increased ad thirdly differences arise due to the microclimate effect from the shadows of building paved areas traffic etc the method of the garden coefficient or hydro zone cg is proposed together with that of the garden evapotranspiration etg ruíz pérez et al 2020 to take into account all the urban characteristics finally the species factor fs considers the climatic zone under study because water requirements of species can vary with temperature contreras et al 2006 eqs 11 to 15 of table 2 in the fourth and final phase of the methodology the irrigation network is analysed since the volume of abstractions is insufficient to cover the garden demand this can be supplied by tap water or from underground tanks of rainwater collected by the suds see eqs 11 and 12 in table 2 in order to consider the efficiency of the irrigation system eqs 14 to 18 of table 3 are applied finally the garden s wf is composed of three footprints green for abstractions eq 19 blue for irrigation eq 20 and grey for irrigation and rainwater surplus that cannot be stored eq 21 all these are outlined in table 3 fig 2 illustrates the flow diagram for the calculation of the three footprints 2 2 calculation of the indirect water footprint iwf the methodology for the calculation of the iwf uses the resources inventory that can be found in the documents that control the costs of construction projects that is the bill of quantities and construction cost databases for the temporal boundary the impact is concentrated during the months that the construction takes place as defined in the project planning the project blueprints outline the physical boundaries of the activities taking place and the results are expressed either per lot area in square metres for comparison to other previous work on construction project assessment freire guerrero et al 2019 rivero camacho and marrero 2022 or per hectare to compare with gardening projects nouri et al 2019 salvador et al 2011 the environmental impact of the resources consumed is based on lca obtained from international databases of construction products martínez rocamora et al 2016 which includes the water required during the life cycle from cradle to factory gate material transport and commissioning impact are also calculated for the resources inventory the accd andalusia construction cost database is employed ramírez de arellano agudo 2010 fig 3 shows an example of a unit cost uc that forms part of chapter 15 on urbanisation the uc is formed with the combination of basic costs bc such as materials machinery and labour or with the combination of bc with auxiliary costs ac whereby the latter are combinations of bc commonly employed in construction that do not form a construction unit by themselves and hence are not complex enough to be considered a uc in the example given in the figure below the mortar is an auxiliary cost agm90200 which is formed of other bcs tp00100 gw00100 and gc00200 see fig 3 thanks to this hierarchical classification it is possible to incorporate the environmental impact of all elements in the project by multiplying their quantities by the unit impact in the case of machinery the average fuel consumption differentiating between diesel and petrol per hour worked by machinery is obtained by eq 22 see table 4 the average consumption of each construction machine is calculated by employing the conversion factor for the volume of water needed to provide one kg of fuel this factor is extracted from the open database ecoinvent frischknecht et al 2005 table 4 eq 23 for electric machines the water necessary for the production of one kwh by the spanish electric mix ree 2014 is used table 4 eq 24 once the unit value of one hour of machine consumption is defined it is then multiplied by the project quantities qi or the time the machine is used at work and hence the total wf of the machine is obtained table 4 eq 25 for the wf of construction materials or of its bc the first step is to change its unit of measurement at the origin m3 m2 metres tons thousands of bricks etc into kg see fig 3 for calculation details table 4 eq 26 the density is obtained from the construction solutions of the technical building code csc and the basic document of structural safety which both form part of the technical building code tbc building actions db se ae tbc 2006 environmental families have been defined from the lca database by distributing each bc per similarity environmental families refer to groups of construction material that have the same origin in terms of raw materials that way the over 300 products in the urbanisation project can be grouped into categories or families in order to assign the lca data freire guerrero et al 2019 rivero camacho and marrero 2022 in the life cycle inventory for each of the materials the water footprint network wfn is the reference framework for the calculation of the wf a concept introduced by hoekstra 2003 and the calculation methodology used is that developed in the standard calculation methodology and the water footprint assessment manual hoekstra et al 2011 this makes it possible to obtain the water use of any production process expressed in the volume of water consumed m3 kg table 4 eq 27 once each uc in the project has been obtained the project quantities qi or the quantities consumed on site see fig 3 budget quantities are then applied and the total wf of the construction materials is obtained table 4 eq 28 3 case study the calculation methodology is applied to an urban renewal project in seville spain which covers an area of 11 441 m2 and corresponds to the complete layout of a street the project is developed by the metropolitan water supply and sewer company of seville empresa metropolitana de abastecimiento y saneamiento de aguas de sevilla s a emasesa a public enterprise dedicated to the management of the urban water cycle in fig 4 the new garden characteristics are represented by colour each different group of plants is part of a defined hydro zone furthermore each hydro zone has factors for species density and microclimate corrections whereby the product of the three factors is the hydro zone coefficient ruíz pérez et al 2020 fig 5 presents the ten hydro zones in the garden the rain patterns and water necessities the analysis is based on the ceteris paribus approach to characterise the level of influence of each variable four categories are defined in accordance with two design parameters the incorporation of green areas into the urban space and the use of a suds table 5 each category is hereinafter referred to as the scenario 4 results and discussion 4 1 direct water footprint dwf the dwf calculation is applied to the scenarios described starting with the initial case s1 using the data input the flow of the suds and the natural system is analysed and the outputs are obtained for the initial state the street is divided into four areas first the north pavement fig 4 empties into the drainage ditch located between the bike lane and the road formed by the permeable surface parking lots and the filter strip second the south pavement empties into the ditch located between the roadway and the pavement whereby both areas discharge into tank 1 similarly the eastern zone is subdivided into two areas that discharge into tank 2 the runoff coefficients ci the average annual effective precipitation and the two generating surfaces runoff sr and loss or abstraction sab are described in table 1 of the appendix and the corresponding volume is calculated in table 2 of the appendix the soil permeability is 3 3 10 4 cm s according to the spanish geological mining institute database instituto geológico minero de españa s f the suds manages the 85th percentile runoff volume as defined in fig 1 for the calculation of infiltrations the project proposes two scenarios first the rainfall regime ranges between light to moderate and highly intense and runoff is retained in the suds and infiltrated in less than 48 h and second runoff cannot infiltrate and runs into the tank during very heavy rainfall according to aemet 2015 see table 3 in the appendix the concept of filtration surface sf is used in an analogous way to that of a runoff generating surface and the coefficient of performance of the suds is applied the outputs of the suds table 4 in appendix are obtained by direct infiltration to the ground vin and the water stored in the gravel layer vssuds subsequently part of the water infiltrates into the ground and the rest is stored in the tanks vstank in fig 6 all volumes are expressed in m3 and the percentages are calculated with respect to the green or blue input volume the input and output volumes of each scenario were evaluated thereby obtaining the dwf table 6 in terms of total volumes for one year and per component of the wf in systems without green areas s2 and s4 if the surfaces are impermeable as in s2 then the system is designed to quickly evacuate a large volume of rainwater resulting in more runoff however if a suds is introduced even if green areas are not present as in s4 the disconnection of impermeable surfaces from the sewer network significantly reduces the volume to be evacuated 67 furthermore at peak flow water is laminated and less runoff occurs in the process the water that infiltrates the ground generates the recharge of the underground aquifer and recovers part of the natural cycle thereby reducing discharges and overloads of the city s sewer systems however the volume of water poured into the sewer network during periods of torrential rainfall is extremely high 89 this could be reduced by increasing the storage capacity of the system with bigger tanks in this case however the limited public space available in the street margins renders this option infeasible in the presence of green areas s1 and s5 or water consuming areas and suds the volume to be evacuated is reduced 72 as compared to the solution that fails to implement any water sensitive design in addition the decrease is most noticeable during rainy seasons whereby peak flows are reduced during storm events and the seasonal variation of runoff water that is to be managed is also reduced the volume infiltrated by the suds accounts for 32 of the total rain s4 s1 and s5 a design based strategy for the maximisation of the use of water collected from rainfall has been employed to achieve a 50 reduction of freshwater demand the project alternates hydro zones with different necessities and with this system it is possible to distribute the available rainwater by compensating the surplus of the autochthonous species with the high water requirements of ornamental species this is achieved with an irrigation system adapted and automated for each area thus reducing the blue and grey footprint gardened soils lose nutrients and for this reason they must be periodically replenished in the case where organic fertilisers are employed the grey footprint caused by diffuse contamination s1 can be disregarded however the use of industrial synthetic chemicals in fertilisers or pesticides produces pollutants in the drainage water s5 the grey wf concept is applied in which the volume of water for the dilution of contaminants necessary to return water to its natural quality is determined this increases the grey wf by 800 hence the importance of applying organic fertilisers which also exert a positive influence on the structure of the soil bronick and lal 2005 organic fertilisers additionally provide nutrients and modify the population of microorganisms thereby ensuring greater water retention and the exchange of gases and nutrients at the level of the roots of the plants furthermore the generic nutrient pollutant balance raises awareness regarding the quality of the water that is discharged out of the urban system treatment technologies such as biological chemical physical processes are not included since those processes take place outside the boundaries of the urbanisation project in the case study the grey water of the street goes to ranilla treatment plant an anaerobic anoxic aerobic system of activated sludge this plant is equipped with tertiary treatment for the removal of nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus the water is returned to the river at natural concentration levels that is without grey wf the blue wf in the present work is 9740 m3 per hectare in s1 which is slightly lower than 11 140 m3 ha per year found by nouri et al 2019 they estimate the blue and green wf of a 10 hectare parkland in adelaide south australia the main differences can be due to the vegetation species and the density of the garden because the seville case study consists of a street with side gardens similar results are found in china the urban green space water use per statistical data in southern and northern cities is 12 570 ha and 6380 m3 ha respectively guo et al 2021 moreover similar results are found in endter wada et al 2008 whose ceiling threshold results regarding the water use of gardens are 8430 m3 ha for residential gardens and 10 620 m3 ha for business 4 2 indirect water footprint iwf the impact on the water footprint by the materials incorporated into the work has been evaluated following the methodology of iwf for this calculation the urban area of intervention corresponds to the area of the street including pavements roads and gardens see table 7 it was revealed that 41 of the impact is due to concrete and cement followed by 35 to aggregates and stones and 12 to ceramics and bricks the prefabricated concrete and slabs for wells and storm tank foundations are more relevant in s2 and s4 while the inclusion of reinforced concrete cisterns is relevant in s1 s3 and s5 where the drainage systems reduce the consumption of prefabricated elements in the storm drainage system the integral renovation of the street and the provision of improved soil that enables the drainage and filtering of rainwater to be reused for street irrigation makes the family of aggregates and stones a critical material for s1 s4 and s5 whereas for conventional solutions s2 these materials exert less impact at the same time the systems involving the levelling of land and the urban furniture mean that metals and alloys together with the pvc pipes used in the drainage system also constitute major families of materials in projects with a suds s1 s4 and s5 the materials with the highest impact are fresh concrete and prefabricated concrete parts refill soil metallic tubes and ceramic pipes in the southern part of the city of calcutta india bardhan 2011 measured the virtual water of the construction of a multi storied residential apartment building of steel and reinforced concrete as 27 m3 m2 of floor area in a similar way based on the project data in the bill of quantities six landmark buildings in e town beijing had a total virtual water of 20 83 m3 m2 of floor area meng et al 2014 also in beijing han et al 2016 determined the total virtual water of another nine projects to have an intensity of 26 5 m3 per m2 of floor area in tehran the virtual water of six residential buildings was 18 76 m3 per m2 of floor area heravi and abdolvand 2019 furthermore the wf of the building life cycle was also determined of a social housing project in huelva spain whereby 27 m3 per m2 of floor area was revealed in their life cycle rivero camacho and marrero 2022 moreover the virtual water of urbanisation projects has been calculated at 2 70 7 25 m3 m2 ruiz et al 2021 which is a lower range than in the present work of 6 11 8 m3 m2 this is due to the complexity of the projects those that include only the street and the utilities installed or other services such as gardens and playgrounds 4 3 global wf of the service life cycle urbanisations such as residential buildings and infrastructures have a life expectancy that is determined by material deterioration and or obsolescence planners in spain refer to appendix iii of the royal decree 1492 2011 of 24 october which passed the law for the regulation of valuations of land rd 1492 2011 it states that roads open air car parks and similar infrastructures have a life expectancy of 40 years however these durations may vary according to the materials used the maintenance and their functionality or obsolescence in table 8 the dwf and iwf are added together for a 40 year period although the iwf of the project with water sensitive urban design s1 is 2 6 times higher than that of a standard project s2 the total dwf over its entire life cycle is 43 5 less due to the annual savings of 65 the breakeven point 9 65 m3 is reached in the 10th year when separative rainwater management s4 is applied the most important iwf is due to the earth works required for the new drainage and infiltration system although with the absence of vegetation the dwf is low as for the incorporation of green areas and irrigation without a suds s3 dwf increases finally the use of chemical fertilisers which are not environmentally friendly incorporates a grey footprint which triggers the annual dwf and nullifies all the efforts made even though the combination of the three footprints green blue and grey mixes different natures this better represents the urban system where water is transformed when it enters and leaves the system or urban project for example blue water becomes grey water when the irrigation surplus is sent to the sewer system and green water turns grey when the rain cannot be stored in tanks for the irrigation of the garden and green water turns into blue water when infiltrated in the soil other authors combine these footprints as modelled by hoekstra 2019 for blue and green water by ridoutt et al 2012 and blue and grey water by penru et al 2016 as identified by mubako 2018 in a review of 70 publications three approaches can be found to model blue green and grey water wf assessment lca and a combination of the two there is a discussion as to whether the components blue green and grey wf shall be added in a single indicator mixing different elements and processes or need to be analysed separately garrido et al 2010 garrido colmenero and willaarts 2011 in the present work the discussion is done separately the project which includes suds in its design s4 but not a garden reduces the grey wf by half with respect to the original design s2 the same happens with the design that has vegetation and suds s1 with respect to the same project without suds s3 and as expected the blue wf is also increased in the last the uncertainty involved in the calculation of dwf regarding the rainfall data remains low because local data is available the soil permeability is also local as is the evaluation of the microclimate and the garden characteristics however the amount of water needed by the greenery eto is of high uncertainty because local and empirical data is unavailable and information pertaining to other sites is used instead contreras et al 2006 costello and jones 2000 nevertheless those sites do enjoy similarities to the weather of seville the iwf calculation has high uncertainty since project specific data has not been employed due to the lack of specification of the brands in the budget and generic lca information is therefore employed 5 conclusion the direct water footprints dwf of blue green and grey water have been assessed as have the indirect or virtual water footprint iwf of urban renovation projects which include green spaces and suds to this end local information on precipitation soil characteristics and greenery microclimate density and species are assessed together with water harvesting construction cost databases are employed for the inventory of resources and the assessment of the iwf the water footprint wf of an urbanisation project in the city of seville is evaluated in full the projects involve the incorporation of new gardens playgrounds street paving and new pavements together with all urban installations such as lighting water supply and sewer systems the traditional impermeable pavement is reduced and replaced by a suds that allows rainwater to be harvested and reused by efficient irrigation systems that are adapted to the demand of the plant species in each area thereby reducing water use five scenarios are evaluated the methodology is sensitive to changes in the gardens suds and fertilisers this new approach can promote the water cycle through coexistence between natural and fabricated drainage and green areas as regards the footprint obtained in incorporating building materials iwf concrete aggregates and stone control the environmental impact stones and aggregates are used in the implementation of suds for the improvement of the land under the permeable surfaces to promote the infiltration transport and storage of rainwater there is also an opportunity to replace these materials with recycled aggregates thereby further reducing the impact another major aspect in the assessment involves the availability of information for the calculations and the degree of confidence in the data used for this study data has been obtained from accessible databases and inventories although it is generic and needs to be replaced in the future by sources of a more reliable and or more specific nature such as environmental declarations of the products consumed in the project the dwf of the built environment has been calculated by adapting the indicator developed by hoekstra and others the hydric balance of an urban system is explored for the first time which includes the street pavements its gardens playgrounds and suds for the calculations local data is employed for rain infiltration and weather but no specific geographical information is available for the calculation of the water needed by the greenery the methodology enables project designs to be differentiated in terms of their footprint the results maximise the importance of the water quality that exits the urban system by the calculation of the grey water as the dissolution necessary to restore its quality the methodology also combines and transforms green and blue input water into a single indicator the iwf of the project is 2 6 times higher than that in a standard project but due to annual savings of 65 in its dwf the breakeven point is reached in the 10th year future work will consider the influence of climate projections in terms of temperature and precipitation which are marked by the trends in climate change to study the vulnerability of various gardens and of sustainable urban drainage systems

15738,the impact of integrating large scale distribution of green infrastructures gis with different real time control strategies on combined sewer overflows csos is assessed for the southern area of the city of montreal s combined sewer system canada an iterative process involving a synthetic design rainfall event and model predictive control mpc of the sewer system is developed to distribute gis according to cost efficiency and spatial analysis criteria the distributed gis are alternatively integrated with static rule based control rbc and mpc for which model simulations are performed for a two month period the performance of the three strategies is compared in terms of cso volume and frequency reductions fulfillment of the outfall environmental priorities and transfer of runoff capture to cso volume reduction a gradual increase in gi implementation levels and an alternative scenario of gis distribution are also considered to assess the performance of the two real time control rtc strategies by comparing the scenarios where gis are uniformly distributed with those where no gis are implemented and omitting the most extreme rainfall event average cso volume reduction is about 65 82 and 92 respectively for static control rbc and mpc moreover the scenario integrating gis with mpc is the only one permitting to avoid almost all cso events and the fulfilment of the outfall environmental priorities gis efficiency performance the transferability between global runoff capture and cso volume reduction is also the highest under mpc even when considering varying gi implementation levels and spatial distribution schemes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords model predictive control rule based control real time control urban drainage modelling source control measure low impact development data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction in urbanized areas combined sewer overflows csos remain a major cause of water pollution botturi et al 2021 rizzo et al 2020 van der werf et al 2021 impeding first contact activities altering drinkable water source quality and threatening receiving waters viability bi et al 2015 madoux humery et al 2015 passerat et al 2011 cso occurs in combined sewer systems which were designed to drain both wastewater and stormwater in one network during rainfall or thawing periods the sewer inflows can be increased tenfold by urban runoff and thus exceed the system capacity during those events cso helps relieve the network to avoid local urban flooding and pipe surcharges many cities in the world are still facing cso problems as their former combined sewer network cannot or can only be partially separated due to economic or technical constraints lund et al 2019 in addition climate change combined to population growth and land development are putting additional threats on the sustainability of stormwater infrastructures alves et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 semadeni davies et al 2008 yazdanfar and sharma 2015 while some urban centers must recover from decades of deficiency in assets management lund et al 2019 the scientific literature shows a growing interest in green infrastructures gis applications for cso abatement for instance previous studies assessed large scale implementation of gis for cso volume and frequency reduction autixier et al 2014 hernes et al 2020 joshi et al 2021 mcgarity et al 2017 patwardhan et al 2005 torres et al 2018 whereas gi benefits for cso mitigation were demonstrated both in terms of cso reduction performance and implementation cost when compared to conventional retention solutions such as underground storage joshi et al 2021 liao et al 2015 montalto et al 2007 some authors highlighted the need for combining gis with centralized retention to improve their cost effectiveness alves et al 2016 dong et al 2017 or to meet specific cso control targets fu et al 2019 liao et al 2015 tavakol davani et al 2015 moreover a few studies applied optimization tools to distribute gis for cso control at a lower cost fu et al 2019 torres et al 2018 or decision support systems to facilitate gi sites selection based on hydrological needs or space availability kuller et al 2017 alternatively improvement of gi performance has also been studied through the integration of real time control rtc technologies this could be realized in a decentralized manner when real time measurements i e water levels rainfall depths etc allow to dynamically controlled gi processes on site such as gi outflow rates xu et al 2020a or through the application of an intelligent control of the sewer infrastructures i e pumping stations or regulators in order to increase the actual retention capacity of the underground network garcia et al 2015 in both cases rtc techniques can involve heuristic or optimization based algorithms a heuristic strategy often implies the application of rule based control rbc which defines a set of control actions based on the state of the system in the case of the application of an optimization based algorithm a single or multiple objective s define the desired behavior of the system and are transposed mathematically in a set of constraints and a cost function to be minimized or maximized different optimization tools can be applied to solve the optimization problem model predictive control mpc is a complex form of optimization based rtc scheme which allows to determine the best global management strategy for each controller of the system and involves a control oriented model of the network as well as predicted data garcia et al 2015 shishegar et al 2018 previous applications of rtc technologies with gis demonstrated increased gi performance in terms of cso volume reduction lucas and sample 2015 lund et al 2019 oberascher et al 2021a as well as under a single rainfall event or multiple consecutive rainfall events lewellyn et al 2018 some authors also compared the performance of various rbc strategies representative of different control objectives with more complex mpc scheme oberascher et al 2021b or forecast lead times xu et al 2020b it was thus suggested that future research work should be oriented in applying more complex rtc schemes such as mpc to improve gis control i e filling and emptying processes with a global strategy xu et al 2020a fewer applications are found in the literature on the integration of gis with the traditional application of rtc at the sewer system scale it is only recently that this solution has been integrated to gis for cso control for instance altobelli et al 2020 compared the performance of combining rtc with different types of gis as well as storage tanks to reduce cso volume and pollutant discharges frey et al 2013 applied an optimization tool to determine the best combination and quantity of gis that should be implemented with gray infrastructures managed by rtc technology which reduced the cost as compared to the base case scenario without gi similarly the study of jean et al 2021 demonstrated that the cso volume frequency and cost can be reduced when the spatial distribution of gis is optimized over the watershed area in integration with gray infrastructures design as well as rtc rules parametrization in comparison applications of various rtc strategies in combination with gray infrastructure for cso management have been highlighted in both empirical and modeling studies van daal et al 2017 lund et al 2018 whereas previous above mentioned works did assess the impact of combining rtc with various types of gis or compared the performance of different rtc strategies without considering gis impact there is still a need to compare the performance obtained from the application of different types of rtc management in combination with gis the main objective of this paper was thus to understand how two different types of rtc strategies i e rbc and mpc influence the performance of large scale implementation of gis for cso abatement and how these control strategies compare to static control the evaluated performance criteria comprised cso volume and frequency reductions fulfillment of environmental priorities established to avoid overflows primarily where the receiving water is most vulnerable to water pollution and gis efficiency i e the fraction of runoff volume captured by gis that is converted into cso volume reduction the main objective can be divided in two sub objectives to analyze how the performance of the different control strategies combined with gis differs for i a series of rainfall events and ii under different gis implementation strategies gis gradual implementation and gis distribution based on environmental priorities for avoiding cso 2 material and methods simulation and optimisation tools were applied to simulate large scale distribution of gis in a highly urbanized area with different control strategies a spatial analysis of the case study area was conducted to determined gis space availability and an iterative design process was then applied to distribute gis according to their efficiency and estimated costs different scenarios integrating gis with different types of rtc strategies were developed to better analyse the combined impact of these solutions for cso control the following section provides details on the applied method and models 2 1 case study the case study is the southern area of the combined sewer system of the city of montreal canada the total area totalizes about 17 000 ha from which 15 000 ha correspond to the combined sewer area weighted imperviousness of about 43 the combined sub catchments are drained toward the interceptor where regulators and overflow infrastructures at each confluence point control water inflows toward the wastewater treatment plant wwtp the estimated concentration time is six hours while the interceptor is gravitational there is a pumping station with a maximal flow of 42 m3 s to the wwtp according to their location along the receiving watercourse each overflow structure is associated to one of the six environmental priority categories from a highest priority to f lowest priority for avoiding overflows reflecting receiving water vulnerability to cso pollution see fig 1 the watercourse vulnerability is assessed by the municipality based on various criteria such as dilution rate at the overflow location aquatic life evaluation presence of primary and secondary water contact activities etc moreover underground storage is available at eight sites for a total of 150 000 m3 of retention capacity the network is dynamically controlled through the application of a rtc strategy a total of 22 regulators are controlled using mpc during the summer season may to october whereas a simpler rbc strategy is applied during the other months details on the rtc management are included in section 2 4 2 2 rainfall data 2 2 1 continuous simulation continuous simulation of an historical rainfall time series was realized to compare the scenario performance over a variety of rainfall events historical rainfall data with a five minute resolution were available from 2010 2019 for the 23 rain gauge stations distributed over the watershed area see fig 1 from these records the wettest two month period namely july august 2016 was selected for the continuous simulation as those summer months are the ones for which cso have the greatest impact in terms of water contamination and recreational water use limitation during the july august 2016 period rainfall depth totalized 223 mm and was distributed mainly among 14 rainfall events 2 2 2 design rainfall event a design rainfall event illustrated in fig 2 a was selected to determine the spatial distribution of gis for cso abatement this synthetic rainfall event is currently applied for cso management projects ville de montréal 2021a the event total depth 19 mm and temporal distribution are based on the analysis of historical rainfall events at three locations over a period of 14 years the total depth of 19 mm is exceeded for 20 of the historical rainfall events and the event temporal distribution corresponds to the average normalized mass curves lasalle nhc 2019 by eliminating cso event under this design rainfall event the assumption was made that the cso frequency over the study period should be reduced to the same extent as for the design rainfall estimated frequency 2 2 3 historical rainfall event a historical rainfall event was also selected to compare simulated results from the design rainfall event and another more heterogeneous rainfall event the area weighted temporal distribution over the case study of the selected rainfall event of august 21 2016 is presented in fig 2b both the synthetic and historical rainfall events have similar duration of about 6 hours total rainfall depths 19 and 21 mm respectively and average intensity over 5 minutes 3 2 and 3 4 mm h respectively in the case of the historical event the spatial distribution of the rainfall is highly heterogeneous the maximal rainfall intensity over 5 minutes attains 81 mm h in some sub catchments whereas total rainfall depths vary from 13 5 to 30 mm according to the location 2 3 hydrological and hydraulic simulation the uncontrolled flows of the sewer system which comprises the surface runoff and the flows in the upstream portions of the network were modeled using swmm5 rossman 2015 the controlled flows i e sewer flows and overflows along the interceptor were simulated and optimised through the application of the control of sewer overflow software csoft pleau et al 2005 csoft hydraulic involves five sub models 1 flow conveyance model 2 storage model 3 flow regulator model gates weirs and orifices 4 pump model and 5 water elevation model the flow conveyance model is a moving average ma model where the flowrate at a given pipe outlet varies according to flowrates at the pipe entry points and their associated flow routing coefficients calibrated from simulated flows in swmm the storage model is based on the continuity equation for determining reservoir and pipe stored volumes the behavior of the flow regulating structures and pumps are defined using rating and pumping curves finally the water elevations at the nodes are computed using backwater and recession curves during the optimization process the nonlinear equations related to the flow regulator model pump model and water elevation model are piecewise linearized to reduce computing time lin et al 2013 measured water levels along the interceptor and flowrates at the flow regulating structures were used to calibrate the manning s n coefficients for the swmm and csoft models swmm results were further used to calibrate the simplified csoft model routing coefficients and bathymetric and backwater curves the overall model performance for hydraulic simulation was validated by comparing simulated flowrates and water levels with observed data more details about the csoft sub models and their calibration are provided in the supplementary material section 2 4 real time control scheme fig 3 details the rtc scheme for the three studied control strategies mpc rbc and static as shown in this fig rainfall data and the swmm model were used to simulate the uncontrolled flows which were managed based on different optimization tools for the two rtc strategies or rating curves in the case of static management all implemented in csoft in all cases the coupling between swmm and csoft is a one way coupling scheme details about each control strategy are presented below when mpc was considered the flow set points to be applied at the 22 flow regulators are computed repeatedly every 5 minutes by solving an optimization problem formulated as a mix integer linear programming milp problem which included an objective function to be minimized over a 2 hour control horizon and a set of operational and hydraulic constraints since repeated optimization runs took into consideration updated measurements for the initial conditions and updated load trajectories for the future conditions past inaccuracies with respect to the process behaviour introduced by modelling and load trajectories introduced by the rainfall predictions did not affect the new control decisions the objective function of this optimization problem see eq 1 was defined to achieve in order of priority the following behaviour 1 avoid flooding volumes 2 minimize surcharge flows 3 minimize total cso volume 4 prioritize cso volumes according to the environmental priorities site specific 5 minimize the time to empty the storage units and 6 minimize gate movements it was defined as a scalar function made of penalty weights multiplying different control and process variables these variables were all defined in unit of volume to simplify the determination of the penalty weights the use of penalty values in the objective function ensures that the trade off between each objective reflect their relative priority i e avoiding flooding volumes within the network will always be more important than avoiding csos 1 f t t 1 n t f t w w v w t f 1 n f w f v f t s

variations expressed in volume at a given controlled site m m3 the hydraulic constraints were made of the csoft hydraulic model expressed as a series of linear equality and inequality constraints they included continuous and binary variables introduced to piecewise linearize the nonlinear hydraulic behaviour of a sewer system the operational constraints were introduced to limit flows and levels in the collection systems as well as to restrict the number of gates movements the solver used to determine the optimal flow set points is gurobi gurobi optimization inc 2021 in the mpc scheme the future states of the system were predicted based on rainfall forecast and modelling results an idealized perfect prediction of upcoming rainfall data was considered in this paper in real world applications a certain level of errors is attached to forecast information omitting the uncertainties associated with the rainfall predictions permits to evaluate the best performances that can be achieved by mpc based on current and upcoming inflows data the optimal sequence of control actions for the regulators was determined for a given control horizon ideally the duration of the control horizon must be longer than the concentration time of the controlled catchment area to guaranty the optimality of the rtc strategy however to reduce computing time the control horizon in the mpc applications presented here was shorter than the concentration time of the whole network namely two hours instead of six which is equivalent to the travel time in the main stretches of the interceptor it was verified that this duration was sufficient to avoid a negative impact on the calculated solution the optimization problem included approximately 58 278 binary variables 93 676 continuous variables and 142 902 constraints but the exact numbers could vary according to the hydraulic conditions the model solution is as close as possible to optimality due to the hydraulic model calibration repeated optimization calculation every time step and the duration of the applied control horizon under rbc a heuristic algorithm determined for the 22 flow regulators a level set point to be maintained in the interceptor downstream of the regulating structure these level set points were computed according to the capacity of the pumping station and the measured level in its wet well they enabled to maximize the pumped flow to the wwtp while maintaining the interceptor under free flow on its entire length we considered a fixed pumping capacity of 42 m3 s and a constant wet well level of 6 5 m under such conditions the level set points to be maintained by the flow regulating structures were constant and almost equal to the crown of the interceptor in the swmm and csoft models flow regulators were operated to maintain the level set points using proportional integral and derivative pid controllers from the set point definition the rbc scheme filled the interceptor from the upstream to the downstream sections consequently the rbc scheme maximized the flows conveyed to the pumping station during rainfall events however conversely to the mpc scheme it cannot maximize for all the rainfall events the storage volume available for cso abatement nor prioritize overflows according to the environmental objectives finally in the case of the static control scheme rating curves directly defined the regulated flows at each control structures without any dynamic adjustment 2 5 green infrastructures spatial distribution the assessed gi types for cso control were bioretention swales bioretention planters or tree pits and flat roofs disconnection for diversion toward a gi or a permeable infrastructure i e bioretention cell or infiltration trench which are the technologies that are most often implemented in the selected case study 2 5 1 gis implementation potential a spatial analysis was conducted to determine the upper gi implementation limit in each sub catchment and for each type of gis the analysis was based on specific land suitability criteria and conducted in arcgis esri 2021 using data about land use and a soil characterization map more specifically the potential maximal number of bioretention swales was determined in each sub catchment based on previous work conducted by linard and charron 2018 and considering that a bioretention swale could be constructed at each local street intersections having at least 10 m2 of space available for gis for the maximum number of bioretention planters at the watershed scale a first estimation was taken from the city s action plan to increase urban canopy for 2030 ville de montréal 2020 the potential physical constraints limiting bioretention planter s implementation in impervious public street areas were then approximated by applying the same correction factor than the one estimated in a previous study conducted for one central neighborhood of the city ville de montreal 2021b as specific data for determining the available space for bioretention planters were not available at the sub catchment scale the spatial distribution of bioretention planters was determined by prioritizing the sub catchments having the highest impervious areas see eq 3 as those sub catchments are considered to be more vulnerable to climate change impacts and would be targeted in priority by the city urban planners for improving urban canopy

sub catchments as for the flat roofs that could be disconnected they were identified in each sub catchment by applying criteria based on governmental recommendations which include a maximum of three floors and a total flat roof area of less than 600 m2 régie du bâtiment du québec 2015 data on soil type and soil contamination were lastly used to separate the previously identified maximal number of gis in each sub catchment in two categories 1 gis of lower efficiency for gis implemented in less permeable and or in contaminated soil areas and 2 gis of higher efficiency for gis implemented in more permeable and non contaminated soil areas the soil permeability was considered low for rock clay or mixed sediments soil areas and high for sandy soils 2 5 2 gi design and modeling the lid module of swmm was used to simulate gis impact on surface hydrology using as input in each sub catchment the number and type of gi units and the percentage of impervious area directed toward gis for treatment the three types of gi bioretention swales planters and flat roof disconnection were all simulated as bioretention cells of 10 m2 table 1 presents the design parameters these values were either based on calibrated values bilodeau 2018 recommended values by canadian design guidelines csa 2018 or swmm literature rossman et al 2016 as mentioned before the bioretention cells were divided in moderate and high efficiency types consequently two parameters were adjusted 1 the seepage rate at the bottom of the infrastructure and 2 the treated impervious area per bioretention unit the reduced performance of bioretention cells for less permeable and or contaminated soil indirectly translated into an increase in construction costs as a greater number of units need to be implemented to reach the same performance as with the high efficiency bioretention cells lastly all flat roof disconnections were drained toward moderate efficiency bioretention cell in this way the gis distribution process was simplified by considering only bioretention cells as simulated gis 2 5 3 gis implementation process the iterative process to determine the location of gis for the scenarios integrating a uniform distribution of gis according to cost efficiency performance consisted in uniformly distributing gi units following their implementation ranking priority given in table 2 over the whole watershed area until there is no cso for the mpc strategy applied under the design rainfall event see section 2 2 fig 4 schematizes the applied iterative process as seen the mpc optimization was first realized without any gi gis were then gradually implemented to capture a volume of simulated runoff in swmm that is equivalent to the cso volume previously optimized in csoft as the amount of runoff captured did not translate directly into the same amount of avoided cso the iterative process needed to be repeated until all cso volumes were eliminated the choice of location and type of gis to implement at each step of this procedure was based according to gi cost and efficiency indeed gis were implemented one type at the time from the most cost efficient to the least until no more space is available for a given gi type more specifically gi costs were determined on a per unit basis according to data provided by the city of montreal the cost estimations reflected the city will to implement gis in an opportunistic way indeed as shown in table 2 some gis had a net implementation cost of zero or a very low cost because these categories of gis were part of the city s action plan for greening the cityscape the city thus considers that adapting the design of those infrastructures for stormwater capture requires almost no additional investment when considering estimated implementation cost and treated area per gi unit which varies spatially a cost efficiency ranking priority for gis implementation can be associated to each gi as shown in the first column of table 2 more specifically this ranking was based on the gi cost per treated area as indicated in column 4 of table 2 2 6 scenario development table 3 summarizes all assessed scenarios three reference scenarios s1 r1 and m1 representing the three types of sewer control static rbc and mpc were first compared for the situation without any gi three additional scenarios combining the different types of control with large scale gis implementation were developed s2 r2 and m2 for these scenarios the design and location of gis were determined as described previously a two month period of continuous rainfall data july august 2016 and a synthetic design rainfall event were applied to evaluate the scenarios performance in addition the distributed gi units in scenarios s2 r2 and m2 were reduced gradually to compare the performance of implementing only 25 50 or 75 of the initial total number of gi units for all the assessed control types static rbc and mpc these gradual implementation levels were simulated for two rainfall events 1 the synthetic design rainfall event and 2 the historic rainfall event of august 21st 2016 lastly a more heterogeneous distribution of gi units was applied to evaluate how the different control strategies perform when gis are implemented only in the sub catchments located upstream of the highest environmental priority outfalls a to e as these outfalls are the most vulnerable to cso impact compared to the outfalls having the environmental priority f as proposed by kuller et al 2017 the gis distribution strategy should account for both space availability and locations for which gis are most required for improving cso reductions the latter being considered in this last developed scenarios named s3 r3 and m3 respectively for static control rpc and mpc however for these scenarios only 50 of the total number of gi units distributed in the previous scenarios s2 r2 and m2 was implemented as the a to e sub catchment s total area corresponds to only about one third of the total study area again the performance of these scenarios was assessed for the synthetic and historic rainfall events 3 results and discussion 3 1 gis distribution for scenarios s2 r2 and m2 only bioretention swales and planters were distributed as their cost efficiency priority was higher than disconnecting flat roofs and because available space for these types of gi was sufficient in each sub catchment to meet the design objective a high number of gis was necessary to avoid cso at each outfall as the design rainfall had a high total rainfall depth 19 mm a total of 198 5 ha 1 3 of the total case study area needed to be converted in gis which was estimated to cost around 194 million of cad the percentage of impervious area treated by gis was also very high 39 on average for all the study area as a comparison the city of new york aims to treat 10 of its impervious area by gis in order to absorb the first 25 mm of rain by 2030 which is an ambitious but yet achievable goal wong and montalto 2020 fig 5 presents the gi units distribution defined according to the uniform gis distribution and the outfall environmental priority based distribution scenarios s2 and s3 r2 and r3 and m2 and m3 for the uniform gis distribution based on cost efficiency priority the gi units were generally found in the largest sub catchments as more space for gis implementation was available at these locations 3 2 cso volume and frequency the two month period of rainfall data was used as input data in the simulation optimisation model to assess the performance for 14 rainfall events fig 6 presents total simulated cso volume per rainfall event for the two rtc management strategies and the static control alone or in combination with gis distributed uniformly according to cost efficiency priority no cso was simulated for the seventh smallest rainfall events for both the mpc and rbc the greatest rainfall event which occurred on august 16th duration of 12 hrs 80 mm and estimated return period of 50 years was not included in the graph to avoid distortion of the data for this particular event the simulated cso volumes for the three types of control static rbc and mpc were almost identical as the network was highly solicited for this event the implemented gi units provided a similar reduction in cso volume of about 40 for all three types of control this result agrees with meneses et al 2018 which also revealed no improvement due to rtc for cso control when the network storage capacity was reached as opposed to rainfall events for which the available storage can be optimized for the remaining events gis reduced cso volumes considerably particularly for the mpc strategy in fact the average reduction in cso volumes due to gis varied from 65 for the static control case to 82 in the case of rbc application and up to 92 for the mpc strategy hernes et al 2020 also found that large scale implementation of gis permitted to avoid cso events for almost all rainfall events fig 7 shows the total captured rate for all cso events this value was calculated as the ratio between the treated amount of water at the wwtp and the total sewer inflows sum of runoff and dry weather flows the presented values include all the simulated rainfall events during the july august 2016 period except the august 16th event as expected the captured rate increased with the addition of gis and as a more complex rtc scheme was applied however the variability followed an opposite trend as the combination of gis and rtc tended to improve the consistency of the percentage of total water inflow conveyed toward the wwtp captured rates for the rbc and mpc scenarios were similar with total values of respectively 76 and 79 for the scenarios where no gis were implemented while the static case reached 67 these total captured rates were increased to 96 and 98 for the scenarios where gis were distributed over the study areas with rbc and mpc respectively and it was 88 for the statically controlled case 3 3 cso environmental priority the simulated cso frequency classified according to the outfalls environmental priority categories is compiled in fig 8 for the 14 rainfall the frequency value was increased by one unit when at least one outfall attached to a given environmental priority experienced a spill during a given rainfall event however if multiple cso events occured at different outfalls having the same environmental priority the frequency was still increased only by one unit in this way the overall respect of the environmental priority hierarchy can be compared on an event basis as expected under a static control of the system each category of environmental priority experienced more frequent cso events as compared to the rtc scenarios and particularly for the outfalls having the highest environmental priorities categories a and c the addition of gis lowered the cso frequency considerably for the environmental priority c in the case of static control but for the remaining categories the impact of gis was marginal or null in the case of rbc the addition of gis reduced the cso frequency slightly more than with the static control for about half of the environmental priority categories in the case of mpc gis implementation clearly lowered cso frequency in almost all categories it was not possible to reach a zero cso frequency for the study period as the rainfall event of august 16th generated important runoff volumes however under the mpc gi scenario the cso frequency remained particularly low for all categories varying from one to four meneses et al 2018 also found that a more complex mpc strategy improved cso control performance when considering environmental impacts as compared to rbc however it might be possible to improve the performance of rbc as suggested by kroll 2019 3 4 gis gradual impact the captured rates estimated for the various scenarios combining gradual gis implementation levels and sewer control strategies under the two rainfall events are presented in fig 9 a and 9b fig 9c and 9d illustrate the gis efficiency calculated as the ratio between reduced amount of cso volume and runoff volume captured by gis captured rate and gis efficiency had opposite trends as the number of gi units increased while adding more gi units permitted to reduce a greater volume of cso overall runoff captured by the first gi units implemented translated more directly into cso volume reduction as the number of gi units increased some of those units captured runoff that would not have necessarily overflowed which explains a decreasing gis efficiency this phenomenon is even more accentuated in the case of the rbc scenario as this type of management was less flexible than mpc for transferring the impact of gis from one sub catchment to another in the case of static control the sewer system was more easily saturated and therefore the gi units implemented can help reduce cso more often as they reduced the inflows of water into the system mcgarity et al 2017 also noticed a decreasing trend in gis efficiency as the difference between cso threshold and the hydrograph peak was gradually reduced due to increased gis impact on runoff 3 5 rtc performance for varying spatial distributions of gis gis efficiency for reducing cso volume was lastly evaluated for the heterogeneous distribution of gi units based on the outfall environmental priority and compared to the initial uniform distribution of gis fig 10 presents the results obtained for the two gis distribution scenarios under the two rainfall events synthetic design storm and historical event of august 16th 2016 and considering a gis implementation level of 50 as expected distributing gis according to the outfall environmental priority based distribution rather than more uniformly over the study area reduced considerably the gis efficiency under static control up to 50 for the historical rainfall event but has a more limited impact for the rtc based strategies when gis are located in a limited number of sub catchments the number of gis implemented in some areas could exceed the number required to mitigate cso volumes at these locations while gis are lacking in the remaining sub catchments as opposed to the mpc strategy static control and rbc do not permit to spatially adapt the use of storage the rbc scenario still performed well compared to the static control case as most of the gis are located in the upstream portion and its control strategy is to fill the interceptor from upstream to downstream nevertheless gis efficiency under the mpc strategy remains the highest for both gis distribution scenarios 3 6 model limitations the methodological framework implied simulation and optimisation model assumptions and limitations which can impact the modelling results limitations of the research work include mpc is applied with a perfect forecast of rainfall data while in real world applications the uncertainty attached to the future state of the system could decrease the performance of mpc the rules involved in the rbc application could be optimized for improving the performance of this rtc strategy and avoiding potential mpc efficacy overestimations the spatial analysis for determining gi maximal implementation level in each sub catchment could lead to an overestimation of available space for gis more restrictive and site specific criteria could be applied for improving the spatial analysis accuracy i e differentiate public vs non public area determining potential treated surface based on topography rather than applying a treatment ratio per surface of implemented gi etc the rtc scheme which involved a one way loop between swmm and csoft could reduce the modelling result accuracy as compared to a two way coupling strategy if the method is applied to more complex networks the gis distribution over the study area could be optimized based on cso control performance instead of uniformly distributing gis according to an implementation priority ranking 4 conclusion this research aimed at evaluating the integrated impact of gis and rtc for reducing cso volume and frequency according to environmental priorities in the densely urbanized southern portion of the city of montreal canada more particularly the study assessed the integration of gis large scale implementation with two rtc strategies rbc and mpc and static control as well as according to various gis distribution scenarios results showed that when green infrastructures are distributed uniformly over the study area according to cost efficiency criteria and spatial constraints volumes of combined sewer overflows are considerably reduced even under static control and even considering rainfall events of various magnitudes integration of model predictive control with green infrastructures leads to greater reduction of combined sewer overflows both in terms of volume and frequency while respecting the environmental priorities and leading to higher rates of runoff capture distributing green infrastructures only in specific sub catchments instead than uniformly across the case study i restrain cso volume reductions by half under static control and ii have only a slight impact on cso volume reductions for both rtc strategies results of this study demonstrated that gis can have a considerable impact on cso mitigation for all types of control but that this impact can be improved with mpc particularly for networks favorable to rtc for instance combined sewer systems which include an important number of control sites and where the receiving water course vulnerability to csos varies spatially offer leeway to maximize the use of both gray and green infrastructures through rtc future work should continue to apply mpc and other rtc strategies in integration with gis to better understand how the two technologies can complement each other the methodological framework could be improved by reviewing the gi simulation assumptions to be more site specific and to include a greater variety of gis types assessment of the mpc performance could also consider the uncertainty in the input parameters i e the impact of broken pumps gate malfunctions or errors in weather forecasts finally gis spatial distribution could be optimized in a closed loop simulation with mpc for improving the integration of both technologies funding this research was funded by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada grant rdcpj

15738,the impact of integrating large scale distribution of green infrastructures gis with different real time control strategies on combined sewer overflows csos is assessed for the southern area of the city of montreal s combined sewer system canada an iterative process involving a synthetic design rainfall event and model predictive control mpc of the sewer system is developed to distribute gis according to cost efficiency and spatial analysis criteria the distributed gis are alternatively integrated with static rule based control rbc and mpc for which model simulations are performed for a two month period the performance of the three strategies is compared in terms of cso volume and frequency reductions fulfillment of the outfall environmental priorities and transfer of runoff capture to cso volume reduction a gradual increase in gi implementation levels and an alternative scenario of gis distribution are also considered to assess the performance of the two real time control rtc strategies by comparing the scenarios where gis are uniformly distributed with those where no gis are implemented and omitting the most extreme rainfall event average cso volume reduction is about 65 82 and 92 respectively for static control rbc and mpc moreover the scenario integrating gis with mpc is the only one permitting to avoid almost all cso events and the fulfilment of the outfall environmental priorities gis efficiency performance the transferability between global runoff capture and cso volume reduction is also the highest under mpc even when considering varying gi implementation levels and spatial distribution schemes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords model predictive control rule based control real time control urban drainage modelling source control measure low impact development data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction in urbanized areas combined sewer overflows csos remain a major cause of water pollution botturi et al 2021 rizzo et al 2020 van der werf et al 2021 impeding first contact activities altering drinkable water source quality and threatening receiving waters viability bi et al 2015 madoux humery et al 2015 passerat et al 2011 cso occurs in combined sewer systems which were designed to drain both wastewater and stormwater in one network during rainfall or thawing periods the sewer inflows can be increased tenfold by urban runoff and thus exceed the system capacity during those events cso helps relieve the network to avoid local urban flooding and pipe surcharges many cities in the world are still facing cso problems as their former combined sewer network cannot or can only be partially separated due to economic or technical constraints lund et al 2019 in addition climate change combined to population growth and land development are putting additional threats on the sustainability of stormwater infrastructures alves et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 semadeni davies et al 2008 yazdanfar and sharma 2015 while some urban centers must recover from decades of deficiency in assets management lund et al 2019 the scientific literature shows a growing interest in green infrastructures gis applications for cso abatement for instance previous studies assessed large scale implementation of gis for cso volume and frequency reduction autixier et al 2014 hernes et al 2020 joshi et al 2021 mcgarity et al 2017 patwardhan et al 2005 torres et al 2018 whereas gi benefits for cso mitigation were demonstrated both in terms of cso reduction performance and implementation cost when compared to conventional retention solutions such as underground storage joshi et al 2021 liao et al 2015 montalto et al 2007 some authors highlighted the need for combining gis with centralized retention to improve their cost effectiveness alves et al 2016 dong et al 2017 or to meet specific cso control targets fu et al 2019 liao et al 2015 tavakol davani et al 2015 moreover a few studies applied optimization tools to distribute gis for cso control at a lower cost fu et al 2019 torres et al 2018 or decision support systems to facilitate gi sites selection based on hydrological needs or space availability kuller et al 2017 alternatively improvement of gi performance has also been studied through the integration of real time control rtc technologies this could be realized in a decentralized manner when real time measurements i e water levels rainfall depths etc allow to dynamically controlled gi processes on site such as gi outflow rates xu et al 2020a or through the application of an intelligent control of the sewer infrastructures i e pumping stations or regulators in order to increase the actual retention capacity of the underground network garcia et al 2015 in both cases rtc techniques can involve heuristic or optimization based algorithms a heuristic strategy often implies the application of rule based control rbc which defines a set of control actions based on the state of the system in the case of the application of an optimization based algorithm a single or multiple objective s define the desired behavior of the system and are transposed mathematically in a set of constraints and a cost function to be minimized or maximized different optimization tools can be applied to solve the optimization problem model predictive control mpc is a complex form of optimization based rtc scheme which allows to determine the best global management strategy for each controller of the system and involves a control oriented model of the network as well as predicted data garcia et al 2015 shishegar et al 2018 previous applications of rtc technologies with gis demonstrated increased gi performance in terms of cso volume reduction lucas and sample 2015 lund et al 2019 oberascher et al 2021a as well as under a single rainfall event or multiple consecutive rainfall events lewellyn et al 2018 some authors also compared the performance of various rbc strategies representative of different control objectives with more complex mpc scheme oberascher et al 2021b or forecast lead times xu et al 2020b it was thus suggested that future research work should be oriented in applying more complex rtc schemes such as mpc to improve gis control i e filling and emptying processes with a global strategy xu et al 2020a fewer applications are found in the literature on the integration of gis with the traditional application of rtc at the sewer system scale it is only recently that this solution has been integrated to gis for cso control for instance altobelli et al 2020 compared the performance of combining rtc with different types of gis as well as storage tanks to reduce cso volume and pollutant discharges frey et al 2013 applied an optimization tool to determine the best combination and quantity of gis that should be implemented with gray infrastructures managed by rtc technology which reduced the cost as compared to the base case scenario without gi similarly the study of jean et al 2021 demonstrated that the cso volume frequency and cost can be reduced when the spatial distribution of gis is optimized over the watershed area in integration with gray infrastructures design as well as rtc rules parametrization in comparison applications of various rtc strategies in combination with gray infrastructure for cso management have been highlighted in both empirical and modeling studies van daal et al 2017 lund et al 2018 whereas previous above mentioned works did assess the impact of combining rtc with various types of gis or compared the performance of different rtc strategies without considering gis impact there is still a need to compare the performance obtained from the application of different types of rtc management in combination with gis the main objective of this paper was thus to understand how two different types of rtc strategies i e rbc and mpc influence the performance of large scale implementation of gis for cso abatement and how these control strategies compare to static control the evaluated performance criteria comprised cso volume and frequency reductions fulfillment of environmental priorities established to avoid overflows primarily where the receiving water is most vulnerable to water pollution and gis efficiency i e the fraction of runoff volume captured by gis that is converted into cso volume reduction the main objective can be divided in two sub objectives to analyze how the performance of the different control strategies combined with gis differs for i a series of rainfall events and ii under different gis implementation strategies gis gradual implementation and gis distribution based on environmental priorities for avoiding cso 2 material and methods simulation and optimisation tools were applied to simulate large scale distribution of gis in a highly urbanized area with different control strategies a spatial analysis of the case study area was conducted to determined gis space availability and an iterative design process was then applied to distribute gis according to their efficiency and estimated costs different scenarios integrating gis with different types of rtc strategies were developed to better analyse the combined impact of these solutions for cso control the following section provides details on the applied method and models 2 1 case study the case study is the southern area of the combined sewer system of the city of montreal canada the total area totalizes about 17 000 ha from which 15 000 ha correspond to the combined sewer area weighted imperviousness of about 43 the combined sub catchments are drained toward the interceptor where regulators and overflow infrastructures at each confluence point control water inflows toward the wastewater treatment plant wwtp the estimated concentration time is six hours while the interceptor is gravitational there is a pumping station with a maximal flow of 42 m3 s to the wwtp according to their location along the receiving watercourse each overflow structure is associated to one of the six environmental priority categories from a highest priority to f lowest priority for avoiding overflows reflecting receiving water vulnerability to cso pollution see fig 1 the watercourse vulnerability is assessed by the municipality based on various criteria such as dilution rate at the overflow location aquatic life evaluation presence of primary and secondary water contact activities etc moreover underground storage is available at eight sites for a total of 150 000 m3 of retention capacity the network is dynamically controlled through the application of a rtc strategy a total of 22 regulators are controlled using mpc during the summer season may to october whereas a simpler rbc strategy is applied during the other months details on the rtc management are included in section 2 4 2 2 rainfall data 2 2 1 continuous simulation continuous simulation of an historical rainfall time series was realized to compare the scenario performance over a variety of rainfall events historical rainfall data with a five minute resolution were available from 2010 2019 for the 23 rain gauge stations distributed over the watershed area see fig 1 from these records the wettest two month period namely july august 2016 was selected for the continuous simulation as those summer months are the ones for which cso have the greatest impact in terms of water contamination and recreational water use limitation during the july august 2016 period rainfall depth totalized 223 mm and was distributed mainly among 14 rainfall events 2 2 2 design rainfall event a design rainfall event illustrated in fig 2 a was selected to determine the spatial distribution of gis for cso abatement this synthetic rainfall event is currently applied for cso management projects ville de montréal 2021a the event total depth 19 mm and temporal distribution are based on the analysis of historical rainfall events at three locations over a period of 14 years the total depth of 19 mm is exceeded for 20 of the historical rainfall events and the event temporal distribution corresponds to the average normalized mass curves lasalle nhc 2019 by eliminating cso event under this design rainfall event the assumption was made that the cso frequency over the study period should be reduced to the same extent as for the design rainfall estimated frequency 2 2 3 historical rainfall event a historical rainfall event was also selected to compare simulated results from the design rainfall event and another more heterogeneous rainfall event the area weighted temporal distribution over the case study of the selected rainfall event of august 21 2016 is presented in fig 2b both the synthetic and historical rainfall events have similar duration of about 6 hours total rainfall depths 19 and 21 mm respectively and average intensity over 5 minutes 3 2 and 3 4 mm h respectively in the case of the historical event the spatial distribution of the rainfall is highly heterogeneous the maximal rainfall intensity over 5 minutes attains 81 mm h in some sub catchments whereas total rainfall depths vary from 13 5 to 30 mm according to the location 2 3 hydrological and hydraulic simulation the uncontrolled flows of the sewer system which comprises the surface runoff and the flows in the upstream portions of the network were modeled using swmm5 rossman 2015 the controlled flows i e sewer flows and overflows along the interceptor were simulated and optimised through the application of the control of sewer overflow software csoft pleau et al 2005 csoft hydraulic involves five sub models 1 flow conveyance model 2 storage model 3 flow regulator model gates weirs and orifices 4 pump model and 5 water elevation model the flow conveyance model is a moving average ma model where the flowrate at a given pipe outlet varies according to flowrates at the pipe entry points and their associated flow routing coefficients calibrated from simulated flows in swmm the storage model is based on the continuity equation for determining reservoir and pipe stored volumes the behavior of the flow regulating structures and pumps are defined using rating and pumping curves finally the water elevations at the nodes are computed using backwater and recession curves during the optimization process the nonlinear equations related to the flow regulator model pump model and water elevation model are piecewise linearized to reduce computing time lin et al 2013 measured water levels along the interceptor and flowrates at the flow regulating structures were used to calibrate the manning s n coefficients for the swmm and csoft models swmm results were further used to calibrate the simplified csoft model routing coefficients and bathymetric and backwater curves the overall model performance for hydraulic simulation was validated by comparing simulated flowrates and water levels with observed data more details about the csoft sub models and their calibration are provided in the supplementary material section 2 4 real time control scheme fig 3 details the rtc scheme for the three studied control strategies mpc rbc and static as shown in this fig rainfall data and the swmm model were used to simulate the uncontrolled flows which were managed based on different optimization tools for the two rtc strategies or rating curves in the case of static management all implemented in csoft in all cases the coupling between swmm and csoft is a one way coupling scheme details about each control strategy are presented below when mpc was considered the flow set points to be applied at the 22 flow regulators are computed repeatedly every 5 minutes by solving an optimization problem formulated as a mix integer linear programming milp problem which included an objective function to be minimized over a 2 hour control horizon and a set of operational and hydraulic constraints since repeated optimization runs took into consideration updated measurements for the initial conditions and updated load trajectories for the future conditions past inaccuracies with respect to the process behaviour introduced by modelling and load trajectories introduced by the rainfall predictions did not affect the new control decisions the objective function of this optimization problem see eq 1 was defined to achieve in order of priority the following behaviour 1 avoid flooding volumes 2 minimize surcharge flows 3 minimize total cso volume 4 prioritize cso volumes according to the environmental priorities site specific 5 minimize the time to empty the storage units and 6 minimize gate movements it was defined as a scalar function made of penalty weights multiplying different control and process variables these variables were all defined in unit of volume to simplify the determination of the penalty weights the use of penalty values in the objective function ensures that the trade off between each objective reflect their relative priority i e avoiding flooding volumes within the network will always be more important than avoiding csos 1 f t t 1 n t f t w w v w t f 1 n f w f v f t s

variations expressed in volume at a given controlled site m m3 the hydraulic constraints were made of the csoft hydraulic model expressed as a series of linear equality and inequality constraints they included continuous and binary variables introduced to piecewise linearize the nonlinear hydraulic behaviour of a sewer system the operational constraints were introduced to limit flows and levels in the collection systems as well as to restrict the number of gates movements the solver used to determine the optimal flow set points is gurobi gurobi optimization inc 2021 in the mpc scheme the future states of the system were predicted based on rainfall forecast and modelling results an idealized perfect prediction of upcoming rainfall data was considered in this paper in real world applications a certain level of errors is attached to forecast information omitting the uncertainties associated with the rainfall predictions permits to evaluate the best performances that can be achieved by mpc based on current and upcoming inflows data the optimal sequence of control actions for the regulators was determined for a given control horizon ideally the duration of the control horizon must be longer than the concentration time of the controlled catchment area to guaranty the optimality of the rtc strategy however to reduce computing time the control horizon in the mpc applications presented here was shorter than the concentration time of the whole network namely two hours instead of six which is equivalent to the travel time in the main stretches of the interceptor it was verified that this duration was sufficient to avoid a negative impact on the calculated solution the optimization problem included approximately 58 278 binary variables 93 676 continuous variables and 142 902 constraints but the exact numbers could vary according to the hydraulic conditions the model solution is as close as possible to optimality due to the hydraulic model calibration repeated optimization calculation every time step and the duration of the applied control horizon under rbc a heuristic algorithm determined for the 22 flow regulators a level set point to be maintained in the interceptor downstream of the regulating structure these level set points were computed according to the capacity of the pumping station and the measured level in its wet well they enabled to maximize the pumped flow to the wwtp while maintaining the interceptor under free flow on its entire length we considered a fixed pumping capacity of 42 m3 s and a constant wet well level of 6 5 m under such conditions the level set points to be maintained by the flow regulating structures were constant and almost equal to the crown of the interceptor in the swmm and csoft models flow regulators were operated to maintain the level set points using proportional integral and derivative pid controllers from the set point definition the rbc scheme filled the interceptor from the upstream to the downstream sections consequently the rbc scheme maximized the flows conveyed to the pumping station during rainfall events however conversely to the mpc scheme it cannot maximize for all the rainfall events the storage volume available for cso abatement nor prioritize overflows according to the environmental objectives finally in the case of the static control scheme rating curves directly defined the regulated flows at each control structures without any dynamic adjustment 2 5 green infrastructures spatial distribution the assessed gi types for cso control were bioretention swales bioretention planters or tree pits and flat roofs disconnection for diversion toward a gi or a permeable infrastructure i e bioretention cell or infiltration trench which are the technologies that are most often implemented in the selected case study 2 5 1 gis implementation potential a spatial analysis was conducted to determine the upper gi implementation limit in each sub catchment and for each type of gis the analysis was based on specific land suitability criteria and conducted in arcgis esri 2021 using data about land use and a soil characterization map more specifically the potential maximal number of bioretention swales was determined in each sub catchment based on previous work conducted by linard and charron 2018 and considering that a bioretention swale could be constructed at each local street intersections having at least 10 m2 of space available for gis for the maximum number of bioretention planters at the watershed scale a first estimation was taken from the city s action plan to increase urban canopy for 2030 ville de montréal 2020 the potential physical constraints limiting bioretention planter s implementation in impervious public street areas were then approximated by applying the same correction factor than the one estimated in a previous study conducted for one central neighborhood of the city ville de montreal 2021b as specific data for determining the available space for bioretention planters were not available at the sub catchment scale the spatial distribution of bioretention planters was determined by prioritizing the sub catchments having the highest impervious areas see eq 3 as those sub catchments are considered to be more vulnerable to climate change impacts and would be targeted in priority by the city urban planners for improving urban canopy

sub catchments as for the flat roofs that could be disconnected they were identified in each sub catchment by applying criteria based on governmental recommendations which include a maximum of three floors and a total flat roof area of less than 600 m2 régie du bâtiment du québec 2015 data on soil type and soil contamination were lastly used to separate the previously identified maximal number of gis in each sub catchment in two categories 1 gis of lower efficiency for gis implemented in less permeable and or in contaminated soil areas and 2 gis of higher efficiency for gis implemented in more permeable and non contaminated soil areas the soil permeability was considered low for rock clay or mixed sediments soil areas and high for sandy soils 2 5 2 gi design and modeling the lid module of swmm was used to simulate gis impact on surface hydrology using as input in each sub catchment the number and type of gi units and the percentage of impervious area directed toward gis for treatment the three types of gi bioretention swales planters and flat roof disconnection were all simulated as bioretention cells of 10 m2 table 1 presents the design parameters these values were either based on calibrated values bilodeau 2018 recommended values by canadian design guidelines csa 2018 or swmm literature rossman et al 2016 as mentioned before the bioretention cells were divided in moderate and high efficiency types consequently two parameters were adjusted 1 the seepage rate at the bottom of the infrastructure and 2 the treated impervious area per bioretention unit the reduced performance of bioretention cells for less permeable and or contaminated soil indirectly translated into an increase in construction costs as a greater number of units need to be implemented to reach the same performance as with the high efficiency bioretention cells lastly all flat roof disconnections were drained toward moderate efficiency bioretention cell in this way the gis distribution process was simplified by considering only bioretention cells as simulated gis 2 5 3 gis implementation process the iterative process to determine the location of gis for the scenarios integrating a uniform distribution of gis according to cost efficiency performance consisted in uniformly distributing gi units following their implementation ranking priority given in table 2 over the whole watershed area until there is no cso for the mpc strategy applied under the design rainfall event see section 2 2 fig 4 schematizes the applied iterative process as seen the mpc optimization was first realized without any gi gis were then gradually implemented to capture a volume of simulated runoff in swmm that is equivalent to the cso volume previously optimized in csoft as the amount of runoff captured did not translate directly into the same amount of avoided cso the iterative process needed to be repeated until all cso volumes were eliminated the choice of location and type of gis to implement at each step of this procedure was based according to gi cost and efficiency indeed gis were implemented one type at the time from the most cost efficient to the least until no more space is available for a given gi type more specifically gi costs were determined on a per unit basis according to data provided by the city of montreal the cost estimations reflected the city will to implement gis in an opportunistic way indeed as shown in table 2 some gis had a net implementation cost of zero or a very low cost because these categories of gis were part of the city s action plan for greening the cityscape the city thus considers that adapting the design of those infrastructures for stormwater capture requires almost no additional investment when considering estimated implementation cost and treated area per gi unit which varies spatially a cost efficiency ranking priority for gis implementation can be associated to each gi as shown in the first column of table 2 more specifically this ranking was based on the gi cost per treated area as indicated in column 4 of table 2 2 6 scenario development table 3 summarizes all assessed scenarios three reference scenarios s1 r1 and m1 representing the three types of sewer control static rbc and mpc were first compared for the situation without any gi three additional scenarios combining the different types of control with large scale gis implementation were developed s2 r2 and m2 for these scenarios the design and location of gis were determined as described previously a two month period of continuous rainfall data july august 2016 and a synthetic design rainfall event were applied to evaluate the scenarios performance in addition the distributed gi units in scenarios s2 r2 and m2 were reduced gradually to compare the performance of implementing only 25 50 or 75 of the initial total number of gi units for all the assessed control types static rbc and mpc these gradual implementation levels were simulated for two rainfall events 1 the synthetic design rainfall event and 2 the historic rainfall event of august 21st 2016 lastly a more heterogeneous distribution of gi units was applied to evaluate how the different control strategies perform when gis are implemented only in the sub catchments located upstream of the highest environmental priority outfalls a to e as these outfalls are the most vulnerable to cso impact compared to the outfalls having the environmental priority f as proposed by kuller et al 2017 the gis distribution strategy should account for both space availability and locations for which gis are most required for improving cso reductions the latter being considered in this last developed scenarios named s3 r3 and m3 respectively for static control rpc and mpc however for these scenarios only 50 of the total number of gi units distributed in the previous scenarios s2 r2 and m2 was implemented as the a to e sub catchment s total area corresponds to only about one third of the total study area again the performance of these scenarios was assessed for the synthetic and historic rainfall events 3 results and discussion 3 1 gis distribution for scenarios s2 r2 and m2 only bioretention swales and planters were distributed as their cost efficiency priority was higher than disconnecting flat roofs and because available space for these types of gi was sufficient in each sub catchment to meet the design objective a high number of gis was necessary to avoid cso at each outfall as the design rainfall had a high total rainfall depth 19 mm a total of 198 5 ha 1 3 of the total case study area needed to be converted in gis which was estimated to cost around 194 million of cad the percentage of impervious area treated by gis was also very high 39 on average for all the study area as a comparison the city of new york aims to treat 10 of its impervious area by gis in order to absorb the first 25 mm of rain by 2030 which is an ambitious but yet achievable goal wong and montalto 2020 fig 5 presents the gi units distribution defined according to the uniform gis distribution and the outfall environmental priority based distribution scenarios s2 and s3 r2 and r3 and m2 and m3 for the uniform gis distribution based on cost efficiency priority the gi units were generally found in the largest sub catchments as more space for gis implementation was available at these locations 3 2 cso volume and frequency the two month period of rainfall data was used as input data in the simulation optimisation model to assess the performance for 14 rainfall events fig 6 presents total simulated cso volume per rainfall event for the two rtc management strategies and the static control alone or in combination with gis distributed uniformly according to cost efficiency priority no cso was simulated for the seventh smallest rainfall events for both the mpc and rbc the greatest rainfall event which occurred on august 16th duration of 12 hrs 80 mm and estimated return period of 50 years was not included in the graph to avoid distortion of the data for this particular event the simulated cso volumes for the three types of control static rbc and mpc were almost identical as the network was highly solicited for this event the implemented gi units provided a similar reduction in cso volume of about 40 for all three types of control this result agrees with meneses et al 2018 which also revealed no improvement due to rtc for cso control when the network storage capacity was reached as opposed to rainfall events for which the available storage can be optimized for the remaining events gis reduced cso volumes considerably particularly for the mpc strategy in fact the average reduction in cso volumes due to gis varied from 65 for the static control case to 82 in the case of rbc application and up to 92 for the mpc strategy hernes et al 2020 also found that large scale implementation of gis permitted to avoid cso events for almost all rainfall events fig 7 shows the total captured rate for all cso events this value was calculated as the ratio between the treated amount of water at the wwtp and the total sewer inflows sum of runoff and dry weather flows the presented values include all the simulated rainfall events during the july august 2016 period except the august 16th event as expected the captured rate increased with the addition of gis and as a more complex rtc scheme was applied however the variability followed an opposite trend as the combination of gis and rtc tended to improve the consistency of the percentage of total water inflow conveyed toward the wwtp captured rates for the rbc and mpc scenarios were similar with total values of respectively 76 and 79 for the scenarios where no gis were implemented while the static case reached 67 these total captured rates were increased to 96 and 98 for the scenarios where gis were distributed over the study areas with rbc and mpc respectively and it was 88 for the statically controlled case 3 3 cso environmental priority the simulated cso frequency classified according to the outfalls environmental priority categories is compiled in fig 8 for the 14 rainfall the frequency value was increased by one unit when at least one outfall attached to a given environmental priority experienced a spill during a given rainfall event however if multiple cso events occured at different outfalls having the same environmental priority the frequency was still increased only by one unit in this way the overall respect of the environmental priority hierarchy can be compared on an event basis as expected under a static control of the system each category of environmental priority experienced more frequent cso events as compared to the rtc scenarios and particularly for the outfalls having the highest environmental priorities categories a and c the addition of gis lowered the cso frequency considerably for the environmental priority c in the case of static control but for the remaining categories the impact of gis was marginal or null in the case of rbc the addition of gis reduced the cso frequency slightly more than with the static control for about half of the environmental priority categories in the case of mpc gis implementation clearly lowered cso frequency in almost all categories it was not possible to reach a zero cso frequency for the study period as the rainfall event of august 16th generated important runoff volumes however under the mpc gi scenario the cso frequency remained particularly low for all categories varying from one to four meneses et al 2018 also found that a more complex mpc strategy improved cso control performance when considering environmental impacts as compared to rbc however it might be possible to improve the performance of rbc as suggested by kroll 2019 3 4 gis gradual impact the captured rates estimated for the various scenarios combining gradual gis implementation levels and sewer control strategies under the two rainfall events are presented in fig 9 a and 9b fig 9c and 9d illustrate the gis efficiency calculated as the ratio between reduced amount of cso volume and runoff volume captured by gis captured rate and gis efficiency had opposite trends as the number of gi units increased while adding more gi units permitted to reduce a greater volume of cso overall runoff captured by the first gi units implemented translated more directly into cso volume reduction as the number of gi units increased some of those units captured runoff that would not have necessarily overflowed which explains a decreasing gis efficiency this phenomenon is even more accentuated in the case of the rbc scenario as this type of management was less flexible than mpc for transferring the impact of gis from one sub catchment to another in the case of static control the sewer system was more easily saturated and therefore the gi units implemented can help reduce cso more often as they reduced the inflows of water into the system mcgarity et al 2017 also noticed a decreasing trend in gis efficiency as the difference between cso threshold and the hydrograph peak was gradually reduced due to increased gis impact on runoff 3 5 rtc performance for varying spatial distributions of gis gis efficiency for reducing cso volume was lastly evaluated for the heterogeneous distribution of gi units based on the outfall environmental priority and compared to the initial uniform distribution of gis fig 10 presents the results obtained for the two gis distribution scenarios under the two rainfall events synthetic design storm and historical event of august 16th 2016 and considering a gis implementation level of 50 as expected distributing gis according to the outfall environmental priority based distribution rather than more uniformly over the study area reduced considerably the gis efficiency under static control up to 50 for the historical rainfall event but has a more limited impact for the rtc based strategies when gis are located in a limited number of sub catchments the number of gis implemented in some areas could exceed the number required to mitigate cso volumes at these locations while gis are lacking in the remaining sub catchments as opposed to the mpc strategy static control and rbc do not permit to spatially adapt the use of storage the rbc scenario still performed well compared to the static control case as most of the gis are located in the upstream portion and its control strategy is to fill the interceptor from upstream to downstream nevertheless gis efficiency under the mpc strategy remains the highest for both gis distribution scenarios 3 6 model limitations the methodological framework implied simulation and optimisation model assumptions and limitations which can impact the modelling results limitations of the research work include mpc is applied with a perfect forecast of rainfall data while in real world applications the uncertainty attached to the future state of the system could decrease the performance of mpc the rules involved in the rbc application could be optimized for improving the performance of this rtc strategy and avoiding potential mpc efficacy overestimations the spatial analysis for determining gi maximal implementation level in each sub catchment could lead to an overestimation of available space for gis more restrictive and site specific criteria could be applied for improving the spatial analysis accuracy i e differentiate public vs non public area determining potential treated surface based on topography rather than applying a treatment ratio per surface of implemented gi etc the rtc scheme which involved a one way loop between swmm and csoft could reduce the modelling result accuracy as compared to a two way coupling strategy if the method is applied to more complex networks the gis distribution over the study area could be optimized based on cso control performance instead of uniformly distributing gis according to an implementation priority ranking 4 conclusion this research aimed at evaluating the integrated impact of gis and rtc for reducing cso volume and frequency according to environmental priorities in the densely urbanized southern portion of the city of montreal canada more particularly the study assessed the integration of gis large scale implementation with two rtc strategies rbc and mpc and static control as well as according to various gis distribution scenarios results showed that when green infrastructures are distributed uniformly over the study area according to cost efficiency criteria and spatial constraints volumes of combined sewer overflows are considerably reduced even under static control and even considering rainfall events of various magnitudes integration of model predictive control with green infrastructures leads to greater reduction of combined sewer overflows both in terms of volume and frequency while respecting the environmental priorities and leading to higher rates of runoff capture distributing green infrastructures only in specific sub catchments instead than uniformly across the case study i restrain cso volume reductions by half under static control and ii have only a slight impact on cso volume reductions for both rtc strategies results of this study demonstrated that gis can have a considerable impact on cso mitigation for all types of control but that this impact can be improved with mpc particularly for networks favorable to rtc for instance combined sewer systems which include an important number of control sites and where the receiving water course vulnerability to csos varies spatially offer leeway to maximize the use of both gray and green infrastructures through rtc future work should continue to apply mpc and other rtc strategies in integration with gis to better understand how the two technologies can complement each other the methodological framework could be improved by reviewing the gi simulation assumptions to be more site specific and to include a greater variety of gis types assessment of the mpc performance could also consider the uncertainty in the input parameters i e the impact of broken pumps gate malfunctions or errors in weather forecasts finally gis spatial distribution could be optimized in a closed loop simulation with mpc for improving the integration of both technologies funding this research was funded by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada grant rdcpj

15739,wetlands especially marshes support many services such as carbon catchment control or water purification led by primary producers such as phytoplankton and microphytobenthos pb the impact of the sedimentary compartment as source and sink of essential nutrients for the water column is often neglected in the study of their dynamics and water purification capacity of the systems this work compared monthly between february 2020 and april 2021 the benthic and pelagic primary producers dynamics in two anthropised freshwater marshes marans and genouillé with the simultaneous follow up of physico chemical parameters of the water column and nutrient fluxes at the sediment water swi interface it was suggested a strong contribution of phytoplankton pumping and the benthic compartment

et al 2014 david et al 2020a 2020b moncelon et al 2021 although most studies focus on the dynamics of phytoplankton and its control factors in the water column recent work has attempted to provide answers to the contribution of the benthic compartment to primary production in these environments the interactions between n and iron fe cycles for the mobilization of soluble reactive phosphorus srp in the pore waters of the sediment have been highlighted moncelon et al 2021 in addition to consider the sediment as a source of essential nutrients for the water column borgaard et al 1990 caraco et al 1990 herzsprung et al 2010 xiao et al 2015 van dael et al 2020 geochemical processes can also be driven by the biochemical dynamics of the water column which makes the sediment a witness of the past giguet covex et al 2014 or recent land use moncelon et al 2021 as a result the study of the benthic compartment brings many assets for the understanding of the functioning of these anthropised systems moreover sediment acts as a primary production support via the pb pb is present in a wide variety of freshwater environments such as rivers dalu et al 2014 lakes lepori and robin 2014 and peatlands neustupa et al 2013 the interest of pb has been accentuated since its introduction in the parameters for freshwater monitoring in european water framework directive wfd law 2011 kelly 2012

parameters leland and porter 2000 dalu et al 2014 sediment can also be an indirect support of primary production via sedimentation reactivation of phytoplankton cells gerbersdorf et al 2000 and or an indirect source of autotrophic microorganisms for the water column via the resuspension of pb as evidenced in marine ecosystems guarini et al 2004 ubertini et al 2012 orvain et al 2014 hernández fariñas et al 2017 consequences for the structure of mesozooplankton david et al 2016 and phytoplankton as well are real the objective of this study was to provide a new and more integrated approach to the benthos pelagos coupling in freshwater marshes based on the mutual influence of sediment and water compartments on their respective biochemical dynamics this was achieved by integrating to nutrient fluxes at the swi the phytoplankton production data and the contribution of the sediment as a source of direct indirect primary production via pb biomass this work also aimed to explore the biological and chemical influence of the water column on the sediment compartment by driving redox condition at the swi the relevance of this work bears on the comparative approach of two marshes with different eutrophication status since they come from contrasted watersheds with different sizes agricultural activities and hydrological characteristics david et al 2020a tortajada et al 2011 this work is also a huge sampling effort as the length of the temporal monitoring was covered more than 1 year february 2020 april 2021 the main hypotheses are 1 high contribution of sediment for potential primary production benthic and pelagic as a source of essential nutrients and chlorophyll pigments 2 different biogeochemical patterns controlling om mineralization in the sediment in both sites due to their intrinsic characteristics anthropic pressure via fertilizer input sediment composition 3 as a consequence a different response of the water column biochemical dynamics face to sediment geochemistry benthos pelagos coupling was assessed through a combined ecological and biogeochemical approach with temporal measurements of phytoplankton biomass production pb biomass mesozooplankton abundance and nutrient diffusive fluxes at the swi the latter were obtained from porewater chemical gradients from core slicing 2 material and methods 2 1 study sites two eutrophic freshwater marshes of charente maritime were chosen according to tortajada et al 2011 and moncelon et al 2021 study sites took the form of secondary channels belonging to the artificial hydrographic networks of sèvre niortaise marans site 46 282 0 969 and charente maritime genouillé site 45 998 0 794 river marshes fig s1 supplementary material the catchment areas in which the study sites were located have similar population densities about 60 hab km2 sage sèvre niortaise and charente two sites differed 1 in the nature of the activities surrounding them catchment area of marans site being dominated by cereal crops 75 of drained marsh whereas that of genouillé is surrounded by both cattle lands and crops study site is surrounded by permanent grasslands 2 the physical structure of the channel about 1 60 m depth 6 m width for marans and 0 80 m depth 4 m width for genouillé 3 and the way they are managed replenishment through ground water and rain at marans rain and charente maritime pumping at genouillé these areas are heavily impacted by the use of fertilizers and in particular in n which fluctuated between 40 and 90 kg n ha 1 permanently in the soil sage sèvre niortaise and charente although no data was recorded informing about water fluctuation water discharge through sea locks gates flow rate height channels were always flooded during the sampling periods 2 2 sampling strategy and parameters studied the coupled study of the water column and the sediment compartment was conducted between february 2020 and april 2021 in both sites the water column was sampled monthly from february 2020 to early april 2021 the sediment compartment was sampled 2 out of 3 months from february 2020 to april 2021 i e in february april may july august october november 2020 and in january april 2021 in all the figures in this paper the axis labels for the months are shown as month for the year 2020 and month 21 for the year 2021 discrete samples whether abiotic or biotic described

coincided with those of no3 and followed the same pattern at both sites with influxes between february and may 2020 between 3 5 103 and 7 0 102 µmol m 2 d 1 at marans and around 102 µmol m 2 d 1 at genouillé and between november 2020 and april 2021 between 3 0 103 and 5 0 102 µmol m 2 d 1 at marans and between 1 5 103 and 102 µmol m 2 d 1 at genouillé fluxes were insignificant between may and

average ʃnh3 fluxes were always outgoing at both sites and of the same magnitude excepted for july at marans influxes at 3 8 102 µmol m 2 d 1 fluctuating between 1 0 103 and 7 0 103 µmol m 2 d 1 in april and november 2020 respectively at genouillé at marans srp entered the sediment between february and may 2020 with average fluxes of about 5 0 101 µmol m 2 d 1 and from january to april 2021 with values close to quantification limit effluxes towards water column were observed between july and november 2020 ranging from 4 0 101 to 5 5 102 µmol m 2 d 1 for october and august 2020 respectively at genouillé srp fluxes were outgoing from february to august 2020 between 1 5 101 and 1 3 102 µmol m 2 d 1 february and july respectively from october 2020 to april 2021 they were incoming between 4 5 10 1 and 4 101 µmol m 2 d 1 january and august 2021 respectively silica fluxes were always outgoing at both sites and ranged from 6 4 102 february to 7 5 103 µmol m 2 d 1 november at marans and from 1 0 103 january to 4 4 103 µmol m 2 d 1 april at genouillé excepted for october and november 2020 at marans and genouillé respectively at both sites iron fluxes were always outgoing and more intense between july and november 2020 with a maximum in august with 2 7 103 and 8 0 103 µmol m 2 d 1 at marans and genouillé respectively 4 discussion 4 1 abiotic controlling factors of phytoplankton blooms 4 1 1 physical and chemical parameters of the water column differences in phytoplankton biomass production dynamics at both sites despite same patterns of temperature dynamics suggest that temperature is not as crucial during bloom periods the regular high turbidity values can create light limitation at high nutrient level when blooms occur liboriussen and jeppesen 2006 indeed a positive correlation between chlatot biomass and pom was observed table s1 supplementary material as it has been shown in lake systems during hot periods pettersson 2001 the non real concordance between permanent turbidity data and spm may be due to the presence of colored dissolved organic matter that are not measured with spm this could be the case in the pre bloom period chla biomass 5 µg l 1 while at high chla biomass 5 µg l 1 particulate matter associated with algae could be the dominant factor affecting the water transparency gilliom and bortleson 1983 however the absence of clear shift in turbidity patterns when high primary production occurs fig 6 also evidenced by the high o2 saturation fig 1 suggests that nutrient availability is the main forcing factor for phytoplankton development it can be noticed that dilution factor caused by rainfall could partly explain the low chla concentrations in winter at marans as well as low spm concentrations and conductivity variability these coincidences were not so much observed at genouillé since hysteresis could bring dilution phenomena a posteriori of the various inputs caused by runoff the low phosphate concentrations in the water column at both sites similar to comparable environments david et al 2020a moncelon et al 2021 made this element a strong limiting factor throughout the monitoring typical of freshwater environments kraal et al 2015 horppila 2019 this limitation was accentuated by the high concentrations of nitrogenous elements linked to a highly anthropised watershed tortajada et al 2011 the permanent high concentration in silica non limitation could be explained by the dominance of small non siliceous phytoplanktonic classes favored by their surface volume ratio in limited environments masclaux et al 2014 which therefore do not contribute to the biological pumping of silica the dominance of small phytoplankton cells could also be explained by their lowest sedimentation rate moreover high turbidity and high no3 concentration rather than nh4 could favor nanophytoplankton as it has been shown in eutrophic estuaries spetter et al 2015 the decrease of nutrients in the water column seemed to be related to a regular pumping of primary producers the negative correlation between no3 srp vs total chla and all nutrients vs total primary production table s1 supplementary material in both marans and genouillé indicated a rapid pumping of nutrients by phytoplankton the almost total depletion of resources did not coincide with phytoplankton peaks which indicated a threshold of primary production at which nutrients can no longer accumulate without allochthonous inputs late summer and early fall for marans early summer early fall for genouillé fig 3 prior to these bloom periods the quite stabilization of nutrient indicated either a balance between regular input and loss by slight pumping or a constant upstream to downstream flow masclaux et al 2014 the positive correlation between nitrogen species and srp concentrations in the water column could also reflect a proportional input from the anthropised watershed especially when nutrients peaked synchronously at high phytoplankton production events indeed the non compliance with the redfield ratio in the water column ruled out the hypothesis of a dominant input via regeneration in the water column even if phytoplankton had quickly responded to physical and chemical change high flow events can oversaturate nutrient filtering capacity by excess of nutrient inputs rudek et al 1991 differences in temporality of biochemical dynamics of the water column at both sites leads to consider the sedimentary compartment as source and sink of essential nutrients 4 1 2 nutrient fluxes at the sediment water interface swi the sediment of freshwater marshes is an important pool of nutrients which can be available to the water column perkins and underwood 2001 wu et al 2017 2019 van deal et al 2020 wu et al 2017 indeed many models highlighted the benthos pelagos coupling and in particular through the mobilization of essential elements for primary production such as phosphorus burger et al 2008 li et al 2016 liu et al 2016 ghaisas et al 2019 ni et al 2019 retroaction of phytoplankton bloom on internal loading of p in pond systems palmer felgate et al 2011 and potential contribution of nutrient benthic fluxes for primary production in marine systems before during and after bloom event grenz et al 2000 showed the importance of benthos pelagos coupling approach a first study in freshwater marshes showed nutrient fluxes at the swi as good indicators of diagenetic processes in the surface layers of sediment and highlighted a link between srp efflux and the dynamics of phytoplankton chla biomass moncelon et al 2021 diagenetic processes may be driven by the depletion and successive use of oxide stocks froelich et al 1979 aller 2004 moncelon et al 2021 or by oxidant replenishment this re supply was evidenced at both sites by the strong nitrate pulses favouring denitrification processes as indicated by the no3 no2 influxes in the sediment between february may 2020 and november 2020 april 2021 here benthic denitrification appeared to indirectly inhibit the srp remobilization at marans by inhibiting the reduction of iron oxides wauer et al 2005 petzoldt and uhlmann 2006 schauser et al 2006 grüneberg et al 2015 indeed the coincidences between the outgoing iron and srp fluxes upon depletion of no3 no2 stocks fig 9 testified to the coupling of denitrification iron respiration at marans this annual monitoring confirmed the co occurrence between the outflow of srp and the development of phytoplankton however this coupling was observed later in the season from late spring early summer to late autumn early spring in 2019 moncelon et al 2021 at genouillé a decoupling between the maximum intensities of iron and phosphorus fluxes was observed fig 9 the srp effluxes despite the influxes of no3 no2 raised the question of the simultaneity of iron oxide reduction and denitrification processes as it can exist between iron and sulphate reducers bethke et al 2011 indeed sufficiently rapid denitrification whitmire and hamilton 2005 or ammonification processes can rapidly deplete nitrate pools nedwell et al 1999 to allow iron respiration processes to occur at the same time the lower no3 influxes may also reflect lower penetration into the sediment as less no3 in the water column which would result in the non inhibition of iron oxide reduction the rather low but continuous rate of reduction of fe iii could explain srp mobilization and fluxes towards the water column through iron respiration interestingly the maximum efflux of srp appeared in july 2020 as soon as iron respiration intensified and no3 no2 disappeared this coincided with the period of maximum phytoplankton biomass development fig 4 the ending of srp remobilization despite the intensification of iron reduction processes from august to november 2020 could be explained by the exhaustion of reactive p stocks in the solid compartment of sediment blooms of phytoplankton outside these srp efflux periods e g april 2021 at marans and between august and november 2020 at genouillé leads to consider other sources of nutrients inputs such as allochthonous ones related to soil leaching from the watershed olde venterink et al 2002 or autochthonous inputs related to dom production and mineral regeneration in the water column johnston 1991 lu et al 2003 in addition to geochemical influence for nutrient mobilization whitmire and hamilton 2005 chen and jiang 2016 which requires a more precise exploration of the sedimentary compartment the temporal differences in essential nutrients fluxes between the two sites and in benthos pelagos coupling can also be explained by different biological community such as benthic macrofauna not investigated lohrer et al 2004 2010 physical luo et al 2017 or water body management kinsman costello 2012 tong et al 2017 site specific patterns which affect om mineralization processes in the sediment indeed the channel size ca 1 60 m depth 6 m width for marans and 0 80 m depth 4 m width for genouillé and water body management replenishment through ground water and rain at marans through rain and charente maritime pumping at genouillé could affect water flow and thus dissolved and suspended matter inputs in the channels if the phytoplankton blooms can be related to effluxes of nutrients such as srp nutrient concentrations in the water column were less so this could be due to a rapid pumping during bloom and or masked by water circulation regimes shanafield et al 2020 moreover the positive correlation between no3 no2 influx and their water column concentration table s1 supplementary material suggested a strong contribution of the sediment to the n mitigation via denitrification processes on both sites jensen et al 1990 wielgat rychert et al 2015 permanent ʃnh3 efflux could indicate both microbial origin via dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra jones et al 1982 and pedologic origin through sediment contaminated by manure and sewage in aquifers sun et al 2022 this n regeneration could supply denitrification processes and thus its mitigation 4 2 biotic control of phytoplankton blooms 4 2 1 predation pressure the use of primary production prod data coupled with chla biomass are fundamental in aquatic biogeochemical studies by including the exploration of predation pressures on the phytoplankton compartment liu et al 2019 here the positive correlations between production and chlorophyll biomass table s1 supplementary material suggested that a balance existed between prey and predator at both sites in this study mesozooplankton abundances fig 8 testified of a potential strong predation pressure in the summer period at marans and over a longer period from spring to late autumn at genouillé a recent study in a lake showed that water temperature and n concentration most drove the zooplankton which initiated phytoplankton withdrawal within months li et al 2019 here the response of mesozooplankton was almost instantaneous coinciding with periods of phytoplankton development this could lead to rapid successions between low and high heterotrophic phototrophic ratios at the onset of phytoplankton blooms and thus a rapid transfer of om in the trophic system lunven et al 2005 maguer et al 2009 dupuy et al 2011 this predation pressure would also create a new source of nutrients for the water column and phytoplankton by regenerating mineral matter through excretory release egestion sloppy feeding or fecal pellets carlson 2002 nutrient liberation by mesozooplankton depends on its metabolism grazing efficiency and assimilation rate and can supply phytoplankton needs in lake barlow and bishop 1965 river dagg and breed 2003 or wetlands systems palmer felgate et al 2011 the pigment composition through the chla pheo ratio is a good indicator of the nature of the bloom a priori observed by bringing information about their vitality the amount of pheo allows a follow up of the evolution of the bloom and the degradation it undergoes in the water column whose rate depends on light oxygen acidification and zooplankton grazing leavitt 1993 parasitism reid et al 1990 or senescence the high chla pheo ratio testified the start of the phytoplankton bloom with a high vitality as it has been observed at marans in april june september october 2020 and april 2021 fig 5 the decrease in these post bloom rates could indicate an imbalance between new production and degradation related to the establishment of grazer communities here the lower ratios for small size classes pico and nanophytoplankton could indicate their preferential degradation at genouillé consistently high vitality could indicate regular new production in balance with degradation patterns of phytoplankton cells during the strongest growth phase between march and november 2021 globally each size class was equally degraded probably due to the presence of different grazers it can be noticed a potential benthic origin resuspension of poorly degraded chlorophyll material contributing to the pheopigment rate in the water column as shown by positive correlations between benthic and water column pheopigments at marans table s1 supplementary material 4 2 2 phytobenthos influence phytobenthos dynamics pb usually dominate shallow lakes and nutrient poor estuaries because of a better access to light drylie et al 2018 mangan et al 2020 and the direct contact with the sediment which is an important nutrient pool sand jensen and borum 1991 concentrations between 9 and 16 µg chla gsed 1 can be found in temperate intertidal bay estuaries orvain et al 2012 and contributions to more than 1 3 of total primary production in some saline environments lake and brush 2011 in our study biomass between 10 and 120 µg gsed 1 table 1 suggested a high contribution of these autotrophic communities to total primary production even in eutrophic turbid freshwater marshes in this study pb development appeared to be more punctual than that of phytoplankton with the highest bloom in spring april 2020 and a moderate bloom during autumn october at marans november at genouillé table 1 if these results cannot be compared on similar environments they coincided with those of savelli et al 2018 in a temperate intertidal mudflat close to our system with global lowest biomass in summer july and august 2020 at marans while other works showed highest development in fall and depression during spring summer garcia robledo et al 2016 at genouillé such depression was more widespread between late spring and early fall these biomass depressions at both sites coincided with potential temperature inhibition periods when water temperature exceeded 25 c fig 1 blanchard et al 1997 savelli et al 2018 moreover positive correlations between chlatot and chla0 5 at marans table s1 supplementary material were observed especially due to their synchronous blooms first pic in april 2020 and second in october at marans however the chla0 5 bloom did not persist both at marans and genouillé which could correspond to a potential light limitation caused by phytoplankton development grazing pressure kibirige and perissinotto 2003 or competition for nutrient talling and parker 2002 the latter could be explained by the absence of correlation between chla0 5 biomass and nutrient fluxes even if slight negative correlation between chla0 5 biomass and srp in the water column at marans table s1 supplementary material could indicate the contribution of pb for srp withdrawal phytobenthos phytoplankton interaction as for phytoplankton chla pheo ratio is a good indicator of the nature of the pb bloom a priori observed the amount of pheopigment in sediment depends on modifications they undergo in water column swi and underneath sediments leavitt and carpenter 1990 reuss et al 2005 which makes the discussion of their origin more complex while pb grows mostly in the 3 4 mm of sediment garcia robledo et al 2016 the high concentrations and vitality observed in the lower stages up to 55 µg gsed 1 between 0 5 and 1 cm depth at marans table 1 suggested deeper pb penetration especially when chla0 5 and chla1 peaked synchronically work in freshwater has shown that chla pheo ratios can even be 1 down to 6 cm depth gerbersdorf et al 2008 this deeper active chla could also be the result of rapid sedimentation of the spm yin et al 2016 as may be suggested by large variation of this ratio in the underlying stages notably at 6 cm in april 21 at marans fig 7a moreover even if cores were collected in the same perimeter ca the order of square meter throughout the follow up monthly variations of these ratios might reflect a spatial heterogeneity rather than temporal change moreover phytoplankton can contribute to pb by percolation and retention of water column particles inclunding chla in permeable sediment huettel and rusch 2000 another hypothesis would be that buried cells can become photosynthetically active again via resuspension of bottom sediment de jonge and van beusekom 1995 gerbersdorf et al 2000 or resuspension induced by macrofauna bioturbation and filter feeding ubertini et al 2012 and thus contribute to water column microalgae stocks the positive correlations between benthic and water column pheopigments table s1 supplementary material could explain a part of pheopigments on the surface layer due to a deposit of senescent phytoplankton bloom phytobenthos and geochemical impacts the presence of pb communities can influence geochemical processes in the surface sediment layers through direct competition between n assimilation and denitrification for example cabrita and brotas 2000 understanding the dynamics of phytobenthos development seems therefore an essential parameter to understand early diagenesis processes the presence of pb can promote denitrification processes by providing a source of anaerobic mineralizable c in sediment laverman et al 2021 as may be suggested by the positive correlation between pb development and no2 fluxes at both sites table s1 supplementary material pb can also have an indirect influence on nutrient fluxes by changing o2 concentrations at the swi and thus impact the release of srp from the sediment sundbäck and granéli 1988 or by buffering the release of oxidants such as nitrates by accumulating them to thresholds that can exceed those of porewater garcía robledo et al 2010 kamp et al 2015 5 conclusion and perspectives the temporality of the srp mobilisation from the sediment coincided with phytoplankton bloom periods external or regenerated srp inputs partly explained its bioavailability when sediment stocks were low the srp and iron mobilisation were well correlated and depended on sediment p stocks iron respiration was inhibited by no3 in the surface layers of the sediment high contribution of the benthic denitrification and pelagic pumping by phytoplankton and pb compartments for the no3 removal from the water column was evidenced the decoupling between phytoplankton and pb dynamics suggested competition and or predation pressures as well as exchange of pigment content between water and sediment compartments sedimentation resuspension the benthos pelagos approach seems essential for a better understanding of the water purification

15739,wetlands especially marshes support many services such as carbon catchment control or water purification led by primary producers such as phytoplankton and microphytobenthos pb the impact of the sedimentary compartment as source and sink of essential nutrients for the water column is often neglected in the study of their dynamics and water purification capacity of the systems this work compared monthly between february 2020 and april 2021 the benthic and pelagic primary producers dynamics in two anthropised freshwater marshes marans and genouillé with the simultaneous follow up of physico chemical parameters of the water column and nutrient fluxes at the sediment water swi interface it was suggested a strong contribution of phytoplankton pumping and the benthic compartment denitrification to the water purification of these two nitrates no3 rich marshes total phytoplankton production fluctuated between 5 winter and 1500 mg c m 3 d 1 fall at marans and between 40 winter and 750 mg c m 3 d 1 spring at genouillé at marans soluble reactive phosphorus srp benthic effluxes 2 101 to 6 102 µmol m 2 d 1 in fall and summer respectively coincided with phytoplankton bloom periods these effluxes were inhibited by no3 penetration in the sediment 0 to 5 104 µmol m 2 d 1 by inhibiting iron respiration at genouillé inhibition of srp effluxes depended on denitrification rate and on p stocks in the sediment where slight srp effluxes 101 µmol m 2 d 1 could have co occurred with slight no3 influxes 5 102 µmol m 2 d 1 in spring the presence of pb between 10 60 and 40 120 mg gsed 1 at marans and genouillé respectively suggested a strong contribution of the benthic compartment to the total primary production benthic and pelagic through resuspension processes in these environments this work encourages to consider the benthos and the pelagos as a unicum to provide better sustainable management of such systems and limit eutrophication risks in coastal areas graphical

catchment control chmura et al 2003 sousa et al 2010 or water purification led by primary producers smith 2003 the understanding of the dynamics of these systems and especially primary producers such as phytoplankton and microphytobenthos pb is essential to carry out actions to manage these systems and prevent eutrophication of coastal areas bucak et al 2018 nõges et al 2009 their dynamics can depend on bottom up factors such as water temperature light penetration or nutrient availability reid et al 1990 top down factors such as grazing or parasitism reid et al 1990 lynn 2003 and or macrophyte competition barrow et al 2019 in freshwater systems nutrient levels can be the first control factor of phytoplankton development these levels are accentuated in industrial and agricultural regions and particularly in wetlands where enclosed water bodies favor their accumulation zhang et al 2020 phytoplankton is a pertinent indicator for the freshwater ecosystems thanks to its quick and strong response to perturbation jiang et al 2014 qu et al 2019 excessive nitrogen n input to these environments through atmospheric deposition peng et al 2019 or agricultural soil leaching fertilizer

limitation for some species e g phosphates po4 2 by modifying redfield ratios this lead to consider these limiting factors as particularly critical for primary production tortajada et al 2011 masclaux et al 2014 david et al 2020a 2020b moncelon et al 2021 although most studies focus on the dynamics of phytoplankton and its control factors in the water column recent work has attempted to provide answers to the contribution of the benthic compartment to primary production in these environments the interactions between n and iron fe cycles for the mobilization of soluble reactive phosphorus srp in the pore waters of the sediment have been highlighted moncelon et al 2021 in addition to consider the sediment as a source of essential nutrients for the water column borgaard et al 1990 caraco et al 1990 herzsprung et al 2010 xiao et al 2015 van dael et al 2020 geochemical processes can also be driven by the biochemical dynamics of the water column which makes the sediment a witness of the past giguet covex et al 2014 or recent land use moncelon et al 2021 as a result the study of the benthic compartment brings many assets for the understanding of the functioning of these anthropised systems moreover sediment acts as a primary production support via the pb pb is present in a wide variety of freshwater environments such as rivers dalu et al 2014 lakes lepori and robin 2014 and peatlands neustupa et al 2013 the interest of pb has been accentuated since its introduction in the parameters for freshwater monitoring in european water framework directive wfd law 2011 kelly 2012 its development depends on hydraulic water flow morphologic width and depth of pools channels substrate nature and physico chemical conductivity temperature nutrient availability notably via land use parameters leland and porter 2000 dalu et al 2014 sediment can also be an indirect support of primary production via sedimentation reactivation of phytoplankton cells gerbersdorf et al 2000 and or an indirect source of autotrophic microorganisms for the water column via the resuspension of pb as evidenced in marine ecosystems guarini et al 2004 ubertini et al 2012 orvain et al 2014 hernández fariñas et al 2017 consequences for the structure of mesozooplankton david et al 2016 and phytoplankton as well are real the objective of this study was to provide a new and more integrated approach to the benthos pelagos coupling in freshwater marshes based on the mutual influence of sediment and water compartments on their respective biochemical dynamics this was achieved by integrating to nutrient fluxes at the swi the phytoplankton production data and the contribution of the sediment as a source of direct indirect primary production via pb biomass this work also aimed to explore the biological and chemical influence of the water column on the sediment compartment by driving redox condition at the swi the relevance of this work bears on the comparative approach of two marshes with different eutrophication status since they come from contrasted watersheds with different sizes agricultural activities and hydrological characteristics david et al 2020a tortajada et al 2011 this work is also a huge sampling effort as the length of the temporal monitoring was covered more than 1 year february 2020 april 2021 the main hypotheses are 1 high contribution of sediment for potential primary production benthic and pelagic as a source of essential nutrients and chlorophyll pigments 2 different biogeochemical patterns controlling om mineralization in the sediment in both sites due to their intrinsic characteristics anthropic pressure via fertilizer input sediment composition 3 as a consequence a different response of the water column biochemical dynamics face to sediment geochemistry benthos pelagos coupling was assessed through a combined ecological and biogeochemical approach with temporal measurements of phytoplankton biomass production pb biomass mesozooplankton abundance and nutrient diffusive fluxes at the swi the latter were obtained from porewater chemical gradients from core slicing 2 material and methods 2 1 study sites two eutrophic freshwater marshes of charente maritime were chosen according to tortajada et al 2011 and moncelon et al 2021 study sites took the form of secondary channels belonging to the artificial hydrographic networks of sèvre niortaise marans site 46 282 0 969 and charente maritime genouillé site 45 998 0 794 river marshes fig s1 supplementary material the catchment areas in which the study sites were located have similar population densities about 60 hab km2 sage sèvre niortaise and charente two sites differed 1 in the nature of the activities surrounding them catchment area of marans site being dominated by cereal crops 75 of drained marsh whereas that of genouillé is surrounded by both cattle lands and crops study site is surrounded by permanent grasslands 2 the physical structure of the channel about 1 60 m depth 6 m width for marans and 0 80 m depth 4 m width for genouillé 3 and the way they are managed replenishment through ground water and rain at marans rain and charente maritime pumping at genouillé these areas are heavily impacted by the use of fertilizers and in particular in n which fluctuated between 40 and 90 kg n ha 1 permanently in the soil sage sèvre niortaise and charente although no data was recorded informing about water fluctuation water discharge through sea locks gates flow rate height channels were always flooded during the sampling periods 2 2 sampling strategy and parameters studied the coupled study of the water column and the sediment compartment was conducted between february 2020 and april 2021 in both sites the water column was sampled monthly from february 2020 to early april 2021 the sediment compartment was sampled 2 out of 3 months from february 2020 to april 2021 i e in february april may july august october november 2020 and in january april 2021 in all the figures in this paper the axis labels for the months are shown as month for the year 2020 and month 21 for the year 2021 discrete samples whether abiotic or biotic described below were realized in triplicates water column measurements such as chlorophyll a biomass chla nutrient concentrations and suspended particulate matter spm were measured from a 15 l sample of water collected in the middle of the channel 2 2 1 abiotic parameters water column in situ temperature salinity turbidity and dissolved oxygen concentration saturation in the water column were measured continuously one measurement per 15 min between march 2020 and april 2021 with hobo u 26 temperature conductivity dissolved oxygen and stbd turbidity sensor nitrate no3 nitrite no2 soluble reactive phosphorus srp ammonium nh3 and silica si concentrations in water column and pore water samples were determined by a colorimetric autoanalyser scalar seal detection limit of 0 02 µmol l 1 dissolved iron fed was measured by icp aes thermo scientific icap 6300 radial in acidified samples purified hno3 after a 10 fold dilution detection limit about 1 µmol l 1 after dilution spm was measured by a combined filtration of 50 ml of sampled water on a pre weighed 0 7 µm gff filter and loss on ignition method to separate organic and mineral materials sediment column sediment sampling and pore water extraction sediment was collected through 10 30 h cm pvc cores and conditioned with a 0 5cm resolution slicing method sediment slicing was realized under nitrogen to avoid oxidation of solid and dissolved phases more details in moncelon et al 2021 porewaters were extracted by centrifugation 3000 rpm 2000 g during 20 min at site temperature and filtered using a 0 2 µm rc25 sartorius filter remaining sediment was freeze dried grounded and conserved at ambient temperature in fresh and dry environment in the dark porosity was from weight loss diffusive fluxes modeling no3 no2 srp nh3 and si diffusive fluxes at the swi f were determined using the profile software berg et al 1998 they were based on the first fick s law calculation as 1 f ϕ d s d c d z with the sediment porosity ds the element diffusion coefficient in sediment c the element pore water concentration and z the sampling depth for each species ds was calculated as described in moncelon et al 2021 using rasmussen and jorgensen 1992 formula and diffusion coefficient in water from li and gregory 1974 and rebreanu et al 2008 tables in this work the negative flux values corresponded to fluxes leaving the sediment the positive values to fluxes entering the sediment 2 2 2 biotic parameters water column phytoplankton compartment chla biomass was evaluated for three size classes of phytoplankton micro 20 µm nano 3 to 20 µm and picophytoplancton 3 µm conditioning was realized according to moncelon et al 2021 and the biomass of chla and pheopigments pheo of each size class was determined by fluorimetry according to the yentsch and menzel 1963 method the algae from each sample were extracted in 90 acetone the concentration of chla was determined by measuring the fluorescence emitted at a wavelength 665 nm samples were then acidified with hcl 1 n 1 µl 1ml sample for pheo measurement fluorescence at a wavelength 665 nm metrics were calculated according to aminot and kérouel 2004 the relative proportions of active chla to the amounts of chla pheo was used to estimate the vitality of phytoplankton cells three volume of 2 l r1 3 of surface water were collected for primary production prod measurements 14c by size classes according to nielsen 1952 method samplings were previously filtered on field on 200 µm to avoid mesozooplankton grazing pressure at the laboratory 200 ml of each replicate ri were completed with 700 µl of a 14c solution 0 37 mbq made with a baco3 salt containing 4 79 of the carbon in the form of 14c ph 9 4 adapted from nielsen 1952 in vial tj before incubation of tj at field temperature and environmental light during daytime 200 µl of tj were placed in glitter tubes and completed with 100 µl of phenylalanine and 4 5 ml of glittering liquid 200 ml of ri were then retrieved and completed with 700 µl of 14c in t0 vials to count initial radioactivity in samples t0 samples were immediately filtered with a 20 µm 3 µm nylon and 0 7 µm gff filters filters were then placed in glitter tubes completed with 5 ml of glittering liquid the process was repeated for tjs at the end of incubation activity of samples was counted by liquid scintillation perkin elmer mesozooplankton

sediment obtained through core slicing method described above between 0 0 5 chla0 5 0 5 1 chla1 and 5 5 6 cm chla6 depth at obscurity 50 mg of grounded sediment were attacked by 8 ml of acetone 90 in 10 ml glass tubes with teflon caps after rotary agitation in a cold room 4 c for 24 h the tubes were centrifuged 750 g during 10 min at 8 c and acetone was recovered and passed through a turner td 700 fluorimeter a second measurement was made after adding 80 µl of 1n hcl ka 0 975 for pheopigments pheo measurements chla and pheo were counted per gram of dry sediment 2 3 statistical tests all statistical tests were made with the software r studio 1 2 1335 analyses of variance anova and tuckey post hoc tests threshold α 0 05 were made to determinate significant differences between replicates if residuals did not followed normality kruskal wallis and wilcoxon post hoc tests were made correlation tests between variables were made using pearson or kendall method according to the residual normality to respect the validity of this statistical test data could be log transformed 3 results 3 1 environmental parameters dynamics temperature increased from 5 to 26 and from 5 to 30 c

from spring to fall and minimal in winter it fluctuated between 12 and 150 mg l 1 december and june 2020 respectively at both marans and genouillé spm was clearly dominated by pim over 75 pom and pim

and 8 µg chla l 1 respectively tukey post hoc test p 0 001 at genouillé fig 4 b the chla globally followed a bell dynamic between february and december 2020 with a maximum observed in june for each size class with 60 25 and 18 µg chla l 1 for nano pico and microphytoplankton respectively as for marans the nanophytoplankton was the dominant size class followed by the pico and microphytoplankton expected in april 2020 where the picophytoplankton class dominated a first bloom of nanophytoplankton was observed in march 2020 at genouillé with 20 µg chla l 1 followed by nanophytoplankton in april 20 µg chla l 1 and microphytoplankton in june 2020 18 µg chla l 1 tukey post hoc test p 0 005 from july to november 2020 microphyoplankton chla biomass remained quite stable around 10 µg chla l 1 while those of nano and microphytolankton decreased by ca 70 in march 2021 a first significant development of nanophytoplankton was observed about 20 µg chla l 1 tukey post hoc test p 0 001 for each

chla in nano and picophytoplankton followed the same trends as for marans they were situated between 30 february 2021 and 75 april and june 2020 for picophytoplankton and between 50 january 2020 and february 2021 and 75 april june 2020 and april 2021 only picophytoplankton vitality was positively correlated with its chla biomass r2 0 31 p 0 01 table s1 supplementary material at marans

mg c m 3 d 1 expected in february 2021 for picophytoplankton in april 2021 a significant increase in nano and picophytoplankton carbon production was observed with about 250 and 60 mg c m 3 d 1 respectively tukey post hoc test p 0 001 and p 0 01 respectively from march to november 2020 at genouillé fig 6 b nanophytoplankton carbon productions fluctuated between 200 and 350 mg c m 3 d 1 pico and microphytoplankton production between 15 may 2020 and 170 october 2020 and between 5 may 2020 and 85 october 2020 mg c m 3 d 1 respectively a drop in may was observed for each size class in winter february 2020 and between december 2020 and february 2021 the production fell for each size classes bellow 10 mg c m 3 d 1 for microphytoplankton and bellow 65 mg c m 3 d 1 for nano and picophytoplankton from march 2021 nano and picophytoplankton production re increased around 500 and 300 mg c m 3 d 1 respectively at both sites the carbon production of each size class was positively correlated with chla fig 4 a p 0 001 table s1 supplementary material at marans it was negatively correlated with no3 srp and nh3 and only with srp at genouillé p 0 05 table s1 supplementary material 3 5 dynamics of benthic chlorophyll pigments and pheopigments at marans the amounts of chla0 5 and chla1 corresponding to the topmost centimeter of sediment followed the same dynamics between february and july 2020 with a maximum in april 2020 and 2021 at about 60 µg chla gsed 1 and 40 µg chla gsed 1 respectively table 1 a second maximum of chla0 5 was observed in october at about 40 µg chla gsed 1 the amounts at 6 cm depth chla6 remained globally constant over time between 5 and 10 µg chla gsed 1 at genouillé table 1 chla0 5 was maximal in april 2020 at 120 µg chla gsed 1 it remained stable between may and october 2020 40 µg chla gsed 1 and increased again in november 90 µg chla gsed 1 chla1 decreased from 60 to 25 µg chla gsed 1 between february and may 2020 and showed its highest value in november 2020 about 60 µg chla gsed 1 chla6 remained globally constant over time between 10 and 20 µg chla gsed 1 relative proportion of active chla over pheo decreased with depth at marans fig 7 a this trend was clearly noticeable for the months of february april may october 2020 and april 2021 in april 2020 and 2021 active chla proportions were the highest between 0 0 5 cm and 0 5 1 cm depth around 50 these results coincided with the phytobenthos peaks observed at these times table 1 the october 2020 pb peak was only transcribed with 30 of active chla between 0 and 0 5 cm in july august november 2020 and january 2021 the pheo and chla proportions were rather stable regardless the depth pheo dominated largely with rates varying between 75 and 80 chla0 5 biomass was positively correlated with its vitality r2 0 84 p 0 005 table s1 supplementary material the proportions of active chla at genouillé fig 7 b decreased with depth excepted for july and october when pheopigment dominated above 75 a vitality about 50 was observed during the phytobenthos peaks in april and november 2020 table 1 chla0 5 biomass was positively correlated with phytobenthic vitality r2 0 47 p 0

103 ind m 3 fig 8 a the total abundance remained above 50 103 ind m 3 until september before decreasing in early fall between december 2020 and february 2021 abundances were almost zero at genouillé mesozooplankton was abundant between april and november 2020 with densities above 20 103 ind m 3 except in may fig 8 b maximum abundances were observed in august and september with 85 103 and 75 103 ind m 3 respectively between december 2020 and march 2021 abundances were almost zero they increased again in april 2021 to around 25 103 ind m 3 copepods and cladocerans were the dominant groups of mesozooplankton at marans and genouillé 3 7 diffusive fluxes at the sediment water interface no3 entered the sediment at both sites between february and may 2020 between 1 5 104 and 4 2 104 µmol m 2 d 1 at marans and between 5 0 102 and 5 0 104 µmol m 2 d 1 at genouillé for april and may 2020 respectively between november 2020 and april 2021 at marans between 1 5 104 and 3 5 104 µmol m 2 d 1 for april and january respectively and between october 2020 and january 2021 at genouillé between 101 and 104 µmol m 2 d 1 respectively fig 9 outside these periods fluxes were almost zero no2 fluxes coincided with those of no3 and followed the same pattern at both sites with influxes between february and may 2020 between 3 5 103 and 7 0 102 µmol m 2 d 1 at marans and around 102 µmol m 2 d 1 at genouillé and between november 2020 and april 2021 between 3 0 103 and 5 0 102 µmol m 2 d 1 at marans and between 1 5 103 and 102 µmol m 2 d 1 at genouillé fluxes were insignificant between may and october 2020 at both sites there was a positive correlation between no3 no2 influxes and their respective concentration in the water column at both sites p 0 05 table s1 supplementary material the average ʃnh3 fluxes were always outgoing at both sites and of the same magnitude excepted for july at marans influxes at 3 8 102 µmol m 2 d 1 fluctuating between 1 0 103 and 7 0 103 µmol m 2 d 1 in april and november 2020 respectively at genouillé at marans srp entered the sediment between february and may 2020 with average fluxes of about 5 0 101 µmol m 2 d 1 and from january to april 2021 with values close to quantification limit effluxes towards water column were observed between july and november 2020 ranging from 4 0 101 to 5 5 102 µmol m 2 d 1 for october and august 2020 respectively at genouillé srp fluxes were outgoing from february to august 2020 between 1 5 101 and 1 3 102 µmol m 2 d 1 february and july respectively from october 2020 to april 2021 they were incoming between 4 5 10 1 and 4 101 µmol m 2 d 1 january and august 2021 respectively silica fluxes were always outgoing at both sites and ranged from 6 4 102 february to 7 5 103 µmol m 2 d 1 november at marans and from 1 0 103 january to 4 4 103 µmol m 2 d 1 april at genouillé excepted for october and november 2020 at marans and genouillé respectively at both sites iron fluxes were always outgoing and more intense between july and november 2020 with a maximum in august with 2 7 103 and 8 0 103 µmol m 2 d 1 at marans and genouillé respectively 4 discussion 4 1 abiotic controlling factors of phytoplankton blooms 4 1 1 physical and chemical parameters of the water column differences in phytoplankton biomass production dynamics at both sites despite same patterns of temperature dynamics suggest that temperature is not as crucial during bloom periods the regular high turbidity values can create light limitation at high nutrient level when blooms occur liboriussen and jeppesen 2006 indeed a positive correlation between chlatot biomass and pom was observed table s1 supplementary material as it has been shown in lake systems during hot periods pettersson 2001 the non real concordance between permanent turbidity data and spm may be due to the presence of colored dissolved organic matter that are not measured with spm this could be the case in the pre bloom period chla biomass 5 µg l 1 while at high chla biomass 5 µg l 1 particulate matter associated with algae could be the dominant factor affecting the water transparency gilliom and bortleson 1983 however the absence of clear shift in turbidity patterns when high primary production occurs fig 6 also evidenced by the high o2 saturation fig 1 suggests that nutrient availability is the main forcing factor for phytoplankton development it can be noticed that dilution factor caused by rainfall could partly explain the low chla concentrations in winter at marans as well as low spm concentrations and conductivity variability these coincidences were not so much observed at genouillé since hysteresis could bring dilution phenomena a posteriori of the various inputs caused by runoff the low phosphate concentrations in the water column at both sites similar to comparable environments david et al 2020a moncelon et al 2021 made this element a strong limiting factor throughout the monitoring typical of freshwater environments kraal et al 2015 horppila 2019 this limitation was accentuated by the high concentrations of nitrogenous elements linked to a highly anthropised watershed tortajada et al 2011 the permanent high concentration in silica non limitation could be explained by the dominance of small non siliceous phytoplanktonic classes favored by their surface volume ratio in limited environments masclaux et al 2014 which therefore do not contribute to the biological pumping of silica the dominance of small phytoplankton cells could also be explained by their lowest sedimentation rate moreover high turbidity and high no3 concentration rather than nh4 could favor nanophytoplankton as it has been shown in eutrophic estuaries spetter et al 2015 the decrease of nutrients in the water column seemed to be related to a regular pumping of primary producers the negative correlation between no3 srp vs total chla and all nutrients vs total primary production table s1 supplementary material in both marans and genouillé indicated a rapid pumping of nutrients by phytoplankton the almost total depletion of resources did not coincide with phytoplankton peaks which indicated a threshold of primary production at which nutrients can no longer accumulate without allochthonous inputs late summer and early fall for marans early summer early fall for genouillé fig 3 prior to these bloom periods the quite stabilization of nutrient indicated either a balance between regular input and loss by slight pumping or a constant upstream to downstream flow masclaux et al 2014 the positive correlation between nitrogen species and srp concentrations in the water column could also reflect a proportional input from the anthropised watershed especially when nutrients peaked synchronously at high phytoplankton production events indeed the non compliance with the redfield ratio in the water column ruled out the hypothesis of a dominant input via regeneration in the water column even if phytoplankton had quickly responded to physical and chemical change high flow events can oversaturate nutrient filtering capacity by excess of nutrient inputs rudek et al 1991 differences in temporality of biochemical dynamics of the water column at both sites leads to consider the sedimentary compartment as source and sink of essential nutrients 4 1 2 nutrient fluxes at the sediment water interface swi the sediment of freshwater marshes is an important pool of nutrients which can be available to the water column perkins and underwood 2001 wu et al 2017 2019 van deal et al 2020 wu et al 2017 indeed many models highlighted the benthos pelagos coupling and in particular through the mobilization of essential elements for primary production such as phosphorus burger et al 2008 li et al 2016 liu et al 2016 ghaisas et al 2019 ni et al 2019 retroaction of phytoplankton bloom on internal loading of p in pond systems palmer felgate et al 2011 and potential contribution of nutrient benthic fluxes for primary production in marine systems before during and after bloom event grenz et al 2000 showed the importance of benthos pelagos coupling approach a first study in freshwater marshes showed nutrient fluxes at the swi as good indicators of diagenetic processes in the surface layers of sediment and highlighted a link between srp efflux and the dynamics of phytoplankton chla biomass moncelon et al 2021 diagenetic processes may be driven by the depletion and successive use of oxide stocks froelich et al 1979 aller 2004 moncelon et al 2021 or by oxidant replenishment this re supply was evidenced at both sites by the strong nitrate pulses favouring denitrification processes as indicated by the no3 no2 influxes in the sediment between february may 2020 and november 2020 april 2021 here benthic denitrification appeared to indirectly inhibit the srp remobilization at marans by inhibiting the reduction of iron oxides wauer et al 2005 petzoldt and uhlmann 2006 schauser et al 2006 grüneberg et al 2015 indeed the coincidences between the outgoing iron and srp fluxes upon depletion of no3 no2 stocks fig 9 testified to the coupling of denitrification iron respiration at marans this annual monitoring confirmed the co occurrence between the outflow of srp and the development of phytoplankton however this coupling was observed later in the season from late spring early summer to late autumn early spring in 2019 moncelon et al 2021 at genouillé a decoupling between the maximum intensities of iron and phosphorus fluxes was observed fig 9 the srp effluxes despite the influxes of no3 no2 raised the question of the simultaneity of iron oxide reduction and denitrification processes as it can exist between iron and sulphate reducers bethke et al 2011 indeed sufficiently rapid denitrification whitmire and hamilton 2005 or ammonification processes can rapidly deplete nitrate pools nedwell et al 1999 to allow iron respiration processes to occur at the same time the lower no3 influxes may also reflect lower penetration into the sediment as less no3 in the water column which would result in the non inhibition of iron oxide reduction the rather low but continuous rate of reduction of fe iii could explain srp mobilization and fluxes towards the water column through iron respiration interestingly the maximum efflux of srp appeared in july 2020 as soon as iron respiration intensified and no3 no2 disappeared this coincided with the period of maximum phytoplankton biomass development fig 4 the ending of srp remobilization despite the intensification of iron reduction processes from august to november 2020 could be explained by the exhaustion of reactive p stocks in the solid compartment of sediment blooms of phytoplankton outside these srp efflux periods e g april 2021 at marans and between august and november 2020 at genouillé leads to consider other sources of nutrients inputs such as allochthonous ones related to soil leaching from the watershed olde venterink et al 2002 or autochthonous inputs related to dom production and mineral regeneration in the water column johnston 1991 lu et al 2003 in addition to geochemical influence for nutrient mobilization whitmire and hamilton 2005 chen and jiang 2016 which requires a more precise exploration of the sedimentary compartment the temporal differences in essential nutrients fluxes between the two sites and in benthos pelagos coupling can also be explained by different biological community such as benthic macrofauna not investigated lohrer et al 2004 2010 physical luo et al 2017 or water body management kinsman costello 2012 tong et al 2017 site specific patterns which affect om mineralization processes in the sediment indeed the channel size ca 1 60 m depth 6 m width for marans and 0 80 m depth 4 m width for genouillé and water body management replenishment through ground water and rain at marans through rain and charente maritime pumping at genouillé could affect water flow and thus dissolved and suspended matter inputs in the channels if the phytoplankton blooms can be related to effluxes of nutrients such as srp nutrient concentrations in the water column were less so this could be due to a rapid pumping during bloom and or masked by water circulation regimes shanafield et al 2020 moreover the positive correlation between no3 no2 influx and their water column concentration table s1 supplementary material suggested a strong contribution of the sediment to the n mitigation via denitrification processes on both sites jensen et al 1990 wielgat rychert et al 2015 permanent ʃnh3 efflux could indicate both microbial origin via dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra jones et al 1982 and pedologic origin through sediment contaminated by manure and sewage in aquifers sun et al 2022 this n regeneration could supply denitrification processes and thus its mitigation 4 2 biotic control of phytoplankton blooms 4 2 1 predation pressure the use of primary production prod data coupled with chla biomass are fundamental in aquatic biogeochemical studies by including the exploration of predation pressures on the phytoplankton compartment liu et al 2019 here the positive correlations between production and chlorophyll biomass table s1 supplementary material suggested that a balance existed between prey and predator at both sites in this study mesozooplankton abundances fig 8 testified of a potential strong predation pressure in the summer period at marans and over a longer period from spring to late autumn at genouillé a recent study in a lake showed that water temperature and n concentration most drove the zooplankton which initiated phytoplankton withdrawal within months li et al 2019 here the response of mesozooplankton was almost instantaneous coinciding with periods of phytoplankton development this could lead to rapid successions between low and high heterotrophic phototrophic ratios at the onset of phytoplankton blooms and thus a rapid transfer of om in the trophic system lunven et al 2005 maguer et al 2009 dupuy et al 2011 this predation pressure would also create a new source of nutrients for the water column and phytoplankton by regenerating mineral matter through excretory release egestion sloppy feeding or fecal pellets carlson 2002 nutrient liberation by mesozooplankton depends on its metabolism grazing efficiency and assimilation rate and can supply phytoplankton needs in lake barlow and bishop 1965 river dagg and breed 2003 or wetlands systems palmer felgate et al 2011 the pigment composition through the chla pheo ratio is a good indicator of the nature of the bloom a priori observed by bringing information about their vitality the amount of pheo allows a follow up of the evolution of the bloom and the degradation it undergoes in the water column whose rate depends on light oxygen acidification and zooplankton grazing leavitt 1993 parasitism reid et al 1990 or senescence the high chla pheo ratio testified the start of the phytoplankton bloom with a high vitality as it has been observed at marans in april june september october 2020 and april 2021 fig 5 the decrease in these post bloom rates could indicate an imbalance between new production and degradation related to the establishment of grazer communities here the lower ratios for small size classes pico and nanophytoplankton could indicate their preferential degradation at genouillé consistently high vitality could indicate regular new production in balance with degradation patterns of phytoplankton cells during the strongest growth phase between march and november 2021 globally each size class was equally degraded probably due to the presence of different grazers it can be noticed a potential benthic origin resuspension of poorly degraded chlorophyll material contributing to the pheopigment rate in the water column as shown by positive correlations between benthic and water column pheopigments at marans table s1 supplementary material 4 2 2 phytobenthos influence phytobenthos dynamics pb usually dominate shallow lakes and nutrient poor estuaries because of a better access to light drylie et al 2018 mangan et al 2020 and the direct contact with the sediment which is an important nutrient pool sand jensen and borum 1991 concentrations between 9 and 16 µg chla gsed 1 can be found in temperate intertidal bay estuaries orvain et al 2012 and contributions to more than 1 3 of total primary production in some saline environments lake and brush 2011 in our study biomass between 10 and 120 µg gsed 1 table 1 suggested a high contribution of these autotrophic communities to total primary production even in eutrophic turbid freshwater marshes in this study pb development appeared to be more punctual than that of phytoplankton with the highest bloom in spring april 2020 and a moderate bloom during autumn october at marans november at genouillé table 1 if these results cannot be compared on similar environments they coincided with those of savelli et al 2018 in a temperate intertidal mudflat close to our system with global lowest biomass in summer july and august 2020 at marans while other works showed highest development in fall and depression during spring summer garcia robledo et al 2016 at genouillé such depression was more widespread between late spring and early fall these biomass depressions at both sites coincided with potential temperature inhibition periods when water temperature exceeded 25 c fig 1 blanchard et al 1997 savelli et al 2018 moreover positive correlations between chlatot and chla0 5 at marans table s1 supplementary material were observed especially due to their synchronous blooms first pic in april 2020 and second in october at marans however the chla0 5 bloom did not persist both at marans and genouillé which could correspond to a potential light limitation caused by phytoplankton development grazing pressure kibirige and perissinotto 2003 or competition for nutrient talling and parker 2002 the latter could be explained by the absence of correlation between chla0 5 biomass and nutrient fluxes even if slight negative correlation between chla0 5 biomass and srp in the water column at marans table s1 supplementary material could indicate the contribution of pb for srp withdrawal phytobenthos phytoplankton interaction as for phytoplankton chla pheo ratio is a good indicator of the nature of the pb bloom a priori observed the amount of pheopigment in sediment depends on modifications they undergo in water column swi and underneath sediments leavitt and carpenter 1990 reuss et al 2005 which makes the discussion of their origin more complex while pb grows mostly in the 3 4 mm of sediment garcia robledo et al 2016 the high concentrations and vitality observed in the lower stages up to 55 µg gsed 1 between 0 5 and 1 cm depth at marans table 1 suggested deeper pb penetration especially when chla0 5 and chla1 peaked synchronically work in freshwater has shown that chla pheo ratios can even be 1 down to 6 cm depth gerbersdorf et al 2008 this deeper active chla could also be the result of rapid sedimentation of the spm yin et al 2016 as may be suggested by large variation of this ratio in the underlying stages notably at 6 cm in april 21 at marans fig 7a moreover even if cores were collected in the same perimeter ca the order of square meter throughout the follow up monthly variations of these ratios might reflect a spatial heterogeneity rather than temporal change moreover phytoplankton can contribute to pb by percolation and retention of water column particles inclunding chla in permeable sediment huettel and rusch 2000 another hypothesis would be that buried cells can become photosynthetically active again via resuspension of bottom sediment de jonge and van beusekom 1995 gerbersdorf et al 2000 or resuspension induced by macrofauna bioturbation and filter feeding ubertini et al 2012 and thus contribute to water column microalgae stocks the positive correlations between benthic and water column pheopigments table s1 supplementary material could explain a part of pheopigments on the surface layer due to a deposit of senescent phytoplankton bloom phytobenthos and geochemical impacts the presence of pb communities can influence geochemical processes in the surface sediment layers through direct competition between n assimilation and denitrification for example cabrita and brotas 2000 understanding the dynamics of phytobenthos development seems therefore an essential parameter to understand early diagenesis processes the presence of pb can promote denitrification processes by providing a source of anaerobic mineralizable c in sediment laverman et al 2021 as may be suggested by the positive correlation between pb development and no2 fluxes at both sites table s1 supplementary material pb can also have an indirect influence on nutrient fluxes by changing o2 concentrations at the swi and thus impact the release of srp from the sediment sundbäck and granéli 1988 or by buffering the release of oxidants such as nitrates by accumulating them to thresholds that can exceed those of porewater garcía robledo et al 2010 kamp et al 2015 5 conclusion and perspectives the temporality of the srp mobilisation from the sediment coincided with phytoplankton bloom periods external or regenerated srp inputs partly explained its bioavailability when sediment stocks were low the srp and iron mobilisation were well correlated and depended on sediment p stocks iron respiration was inhibited by no3 in the surface layers of the sediment high contribution of the benthic denitrification and pelagic pumping by phytoplankton and pb compartments for the no3 removal from the water column was evidenced the decoupling between phytoplankton and pb dynamics suggested competition and or predation pressures as well as exchange of pigment content between water and sediment compartments sedimentation resuspension the benthos pelagos approach seems essential for a better understanding of the water purification capacity of anthropised environments it is also part of their carbon balance assessment in a context of global change and deserves a more detailed monitoring of geochemical processes declaration of
