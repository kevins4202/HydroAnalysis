14540,a hydrophobic composite sponge with photocatalytic property is fabricated combining porous polydimethylsiloxane pdms structure and semiconductor tio2 nanocatalyst the porous pdms structures are prepared using sugar as a sacrificial template the typical size of the pores in the sponge varies from 10 μm to 100 μm the surface and the pore wall of the pdms sponge are decorated with tio2 nanoparticles which are mostly present as an aggregate these pdms composite sponges were shown to remove organic pollutants such as the toxic dye rhodamine b from water efficiently and selectively via synergistic effects of adsorption and photocatalytic degradation these sponges first remove a significant amount of the dye from solution by adsorption 50 removal even in the absence of light upon exposure to solar light the dye adsorbed on the surface of the tio2 pdms sponge was photocatalytically degraded resulting in the further removal of the dye from solution total 80 removal the overall dye removal efficiency tio2 pdms composite sponge is comparable with that of a similar amount of the tio2 in solution however the application of composites eliminates the need for complicated separation of the powder catalyst from the solution most importantly these composite sponges could be easily regenerated by exposing them to solar light the excellent performance and the recyclability of these cost effective tio2 pdms sponges suggest their promising applications in textile wastewater treatment keywords tio2 pdms photocatalysis wastewater solar 1 introduction contamination of water sources and shortages of clean drinkable water is a serious problem globally 1 3 various efforts are being made to provide clean water as well as to remove contaminants from wastewater sources to mitigate environmental damages textile wastewater containing significant amount of synthetic dyes poses serious threat to marine environments 4 6 azo dyes which constitute up to 70 of the total textile dyes are recalcitrant non biodegradable and persistent and their transformation products aromatic amines are usually toxic to aquatic organisms 7 8 additionally the textile industry has an inherently high water consumption and wastewater discharge rate which contains a significant amount of the dye unfortunately most of the existing techniques for the removal of azo dye suffer from various drawbacks removal of dye using activated carbon involves only the phase transfer of pollutants which requires an additional treatment process 9 application of membrane to remove azo dyes leads to secondary waste effluents and suffers from membrane fouling and flux decline biological treatments require strict controls over ph and temperature 10 photocatalysis has been demonstrated as a low cost and sustainable technology for the photocatalytic degradation of azo dyes 11 13 one of the main advantages of the photocatalysts is the utilization of solar energy to decompose the organic pollutants an example is the application of a tio2 based photocatalytic system for the degradation of pollutants from air and water under solar light titanium dioxide is identified as one of the most efficient photocatalysts for the water pollutants because of its photostability low cost and resistance to corrosion 14 16 however owing to the short wavelength cutoff of tio2 adsorption only a small fraction of solar photons 4 can be utilized to excite this photocatalyst resulting in a low photocatalytic yield 17 the separation process of the tio2 nanoparticles from the treated water causes additional complexity 17 18 free tio2 nanoparticles left in water have been shown to be harmful to aquatic organisms 18 20 this problem can be eliminated by immobilizing the photocatalyst on a substrate or integrated into thin films or polymers 21 23 to date a wide range of materials such as polymer films porous polymers have been used to immobilize tio2 23 25 for example tio2 is utilized in nanocomposite coatings to produce self cleaning surfaces as well as to produce catalytic membranes for creating fabrics capable of oil water separation pattern printing and super hydrophobicity 14 21 25 26 by incorporating the catalyst into a porous hydrophobic substrate water treatment can be accomplished by both photocatalysis and physical separation of the contaminant from the water however challenges remain in developing large scale non toxic photocatalyst polymer composites in an inexpensive and efficient way most of the methods reported in the literature include complicated synthesis method or expensive ingredients 21 25 27 here we present a high performance reusable composite incorporating a photocatalyst like tio2 onto pdms sponges for removal and solar mediated degradation of toxic azo dye rhodamine b from the water pdms consists of repeated units of osi ch3 2o and is inherently hydrophobic it is known for its ability to absorb small hydrophobic molecules and organic molecules pdms will absorb rhodamine b molecule through its nonpolar hydrophobic end fig 1 a and b pdms is routinely used as a biomedical implant material and for fundamental cellular studies and has been confirmed as a biocompatible material 28 29 similarly the biocompatibility of tio2 nanoparticles is researched due to its increased application in everyday life 18 however the biocompatibility of tio2 may not be an issue for the current application since tio2 is immobilized in the pdms sponge matrix furthermore the strong adhesion of tio2 with the pdms is ensured to prevent their leaching from pdms to the environment the price of raw material for pdms is comparable with other polymeric membrane materials such as cellulose acetate and polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf it can be cheaper than many other commonly used polymers for wastewater treatment such as an anionic perfluorinated polymer nafion cellulose acetate polycarbonate pc polysulfone fluoride psf 30 moreover unlike many other membranes the preparation of the pdms sponge does not require any expensive chemicals or intricate synthesis processes or equipment this cost effective and biocompatible material is readily adapted to making porous sponge like structures 31 32 pdms sponges have been shown to be capable of selectively absorbing oils and organic solvents and heavy metal ions from water 33 36 pdms possess high transmittance and low adsorption under solar light which is suitable for desirable photo mediated applications 37 porous pdms can also be compressed repeatedly without losing structural integrity meaning it can be easily recycled and used in applications that require fitting in complex geometries for the first time we have demonstrated the application of a tio2 pdms composite sponge which cannot only efficiently remove organic compounds from wastewater by adsorption but also by subsequently breaking them down via the photocatalytic action of tio2 under solar light 1 c most importantly owing to the photocatalytic effect of tio2 the tio2 pdms sponge can be easily regenerated by exposing them to solar light the pdms sponges were prepared using a simple sugar template method the sugar was leached using water the surface modified tio2 was added to pdms sponge by a simple injection method this technique is suitable for scaled up production 32 this study focused on dye removal from water as a function of the amount of tio2 in the pdms sponge versus the initial concentration of the dye it has been demonstrated that these sponges can be recycled at least three times without losing efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 fabrication of composite sponge titanium dioxide tio2 nanopowder aeroxide p25 was purchased from sigma aldrich according to the manufacturer s data the tio2 has a specific surface area of 35 65 m2 g bet and a mean diameter of 21 nm pdms prepolymer sylgard 184a and the thermal curing agent sylgard 184b were purchased from galco industrial electronics the pdms sponges were fabricated following a method mentioned in the literature 36 briefly commercially available cube sugar was used as a template to fabricate porous pdms initially standard sugar cubes were dipped in a 10 1 ratio solution of pdms pre polymer and a curing agent the cubes were then placed under vacuum for degassing the polymer mixture infiltrated into the intergranular spaces of the sugar templates due to capillary forces the sugar template with absorbed polymer solution was placed in an oven at 70 c for 1 h to complete the curing process the cured polymer sugar template sponges were then immersed in warm 75 80 c water to leach out the sugar leaving the final pdms sponge structures a 1 mg ml solution of titanium dioxide was prepared in a solution of hexamethyldisiloxane hmds and ethanol 1 10 by volume different amounts of tio2 solution were injected into the pdms sponges to achieve tio2 pdms sponge composites with different concentrations of tio2 the residual ethanol in the sponges was allowed to evaporate at room temperature tio2 pdms composite sponges were prepared with three different concentrations of catalyst 36 μg gm of sponge 71 μg gm of sponge and 142 μg gm of sponge 2 2 characterization of tio2 pdms composite sponge the tio2 pdms sponges were characterized using a thermo scientific evolution 300 uv vis spectrophotometer equipped with the integrated sphere structural characterization of the composite was performed using a hitachi s 3200n scanning electron microscope energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx was performed using the same microscope to confirm the composition of the composite sponges 2 3 photodegradation experiments rhodamine b was used as a model azo dye to assess the effectiveness of the sponges in removing dye from water tio2 pdms composite sponges were cut into thin slices 2 3 mm to allow for light adsorption the composite sponges were immersed in 6 ml of different concentration rhodamine b solutions before irradiation the dye solution containing the sponge sample was kept in the dark overnight to allow the dye adsorption by the sponge to reach equilibrium after this the dye solution with a sponge in a quartz tube was exposed to the solar spectrum at an intensity of 100 mw cm2 for solar light an abet technologies sunlite solar simulator with am 1 5 filter and a 1000 w xenon arc lamp were used the samples were exposed to solar light for 1 h aliquots of dye solution were collected in 10 or 15 min increments and the concentration of dye in the solution was monitored by uv vis spectroscopy 2 4 recyclability experiments after performing the photo degradation experiments the sponges were washed with di water immersed in fresh di water and exposed to natural sunlight 10 15 h until the remaining dye in the material had been fully degraded as indicated by the pdms returning to its natural white color they were then used in follow up experiments to characterize their recyclability and the loss of performance across repeated usages 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of composite sponge tio2 is dispersed in a solution of hexamethyldisiloxane hmds and ethanol hexamethyldisilazane hmds was added to the tio2 to functionalize their surfaces with hydrophobic ch3 groups different amount of the tio2 solution was injected into the cured pdms sponge the ethanol was evaporated leaving the tio2 on the surface of pdms sponge pdms is a hydrophobic polymer and is known to adsorb small hydrophobic molecule functionalizing the surface of tio2 with hydrophobic functional group promotes the strong adherence of the tio2 to the pdms matrix 38 the adherence of tio2 to pdms was confirmed by sonicating tio2 pdms sponge in pure water for 30 min 39 we compared the uv vis absorbance of the water before and after the sonication to find no trace of tio2 leaching into the water from the pdms sponges sem studies were conducted to confirm the porous interconnected 3 dimensional framework of the pdms sponges as well as the successful adherence of the catalyst to the polymer the micrograph in fig 2 a and fig 2 b exhibit the porous structure of the composite sponge with two different concentration of tio2 sem analysis of the sponges confirmed the expected porous structure of the composite pore size was determined through manual measurements of at least fifty pores calibrated off the scale bar of images acquired by sem pores were found to be roughly few microns to tens of microns in size the variation in pore size is attributed to the intrinsic lack of a narrow pore size distribution in a sugar cube the size of sugar particle is roughly 10 μm 100 μm which is determined from the optical microscopy image fig s1 increasing the concentration of tio2 from 71 μg per gm of sponge and 142 μg per gm of sponge did not influence the pore size significantly the tio2 was deposited on the pore wall and the surface of pdms sponge fig 2 c and 2 d tio2 particles are primarily present as aggregate roughly 100 nm 500 nm in size figs 2 c and d as shown in the edx spectrograph of tio2 pdms composite sponge in fig 2 e the characteristic peaks for titanium oxygen and silicon confirm the presence of tio2 on the pdms surface the additional peaks are representative of the sample preparation and indicate components of the substrate and coating both sem and tem images of tio2 catalyst in solution are shown in fig 3 as can be seen from both of the images the particles have aggregated in the solution which is expected as tio2 does not disperse well in water regardless of the lack of nano scale catalyst particles the as achieved tio2 pdms sponges exhibited enhanced performance towards removal of organic pollutants when compared to the tio2 directly dispersed in the solution 3 2 removal of dye from solution using sponges before the photocatalytic study the composite sponges are incubated in the dye solution and allowed to reach adsorption equilibrium which is achieved within one hour as can be seen in the plot in fig 4 the intensity of the absorbance peak at 550 nm representative of the rhodamine b concentration in solution decreases significantly after the sponges are allowed to soak in the solution overnight almost 60 of the dye was removed from solution due to the adsorption of dye by the pdms sponge however it does not exhibit significant further removal of dye when exposed to light fig 4 a addition of tio2 to pdms slightly decreased the adsorption of dye from the solution fig 4 b and fig 5 a the tio2 pdms sponge removes 40 dye only by the adsorption ultimately it can remove total 80 of the dye after 1 h exposure to sunlight due to photodegradation fig 4 b it should also be noted that only the sponge with tio2 can be recycled as the photocatalytic action of tio2 can help in breaking down the remaining dye in the sponge as expected the pure tio2 powder does not show any significant removal of dye by adsorption fig 5a the performance of sponges with different amount of tio2 was compared to understand the effect of tio2 concentration of the sponge on the removal of dye fig 5 a dye removal by overnight adsorption decreased from 50 to 43 as the tio2 concentration in the sponge increased from 35 μg per gram of sponge to 142 μg g this may be due to the decrease in pore volume with the addition of tio2 to the sponge however the sponges containing tio2 can degrade the dye under the solar light by photocatalytic action we can see that just after one hour of solar light exposure the dye removal by the sponges with a tio2 concentration of 71 μg g and 142 μg g exceeded the performance of plain pdms sponges the efficiencies of the dye removal by sponges with different initial dye concentration solutions are compared fig 5 b the dye removal efficiency by adsorption increased with increasing initial dye concentration from 2 5 mg l to 5 mg l whereas it remains almost similar when the concentration further increased to 10 mg l the driving force for mass transfer increased with increasing initial dye concentration promoting the transfer of dye molecules through the bulk solution to the sponge surface however further increase of dye concentration does not improve the adsorption efficiency because the number of vacant active sites was limited the number of active sites can be insufficient for the abundant dye molecules at higher concentration 40 3 3 photocatalytic degradation after the dye solution and sponge reached adsorption equilibrium in the dark it was exposed to solar light for 1 h the tio2 pdms composite sponge was expected to exhibit further removal of dye from the solution due to photocatalytic action of tio2 the relevant reactions at the tio2 surface causing the degradation of rhodamine b rhb dyes can be expressed as follows 41 1 tio 2 h ν uv tio 2 e cb h vb 2 tio 2 h vb h 2 o tio 2 h oh 3 tio 2 e c b o 2 tio 2 o 2 4 rhb oh degradation products 5 rhb h vb degradation products 6 rhb e cb degradation products rhodamine b contains four n ethyl groups at either side of the xanthene ring fig 1 a photodegradation of this dye molecule usually occurs via two competitive processes 1 n deethylation and 2 destruction of the conjugated structure 42 a hypsochromic shift of the adsorption band indicates the formation of a series of n deethylated intermediates however in our case no obvious adsorption band shift was observed in the case of photocatalytic reduction of rhodamine b using tio2 alone or tio2 pdms nanocomposite fig 4 b and fig 6 a this suggests that the dye degradation is mainly due to the efficient decomposition of the conjugated xanthene ring in rhodamine b as shown above the decomposition of rhodamine b can be initiated with positive holes hvb or surface bound oh or in the solution with superoxide anion o2 fig 1 c due to the strong oxidizing nature of oh radicals reaction step 4 has been predicted to be most important for the degradation of rhodamine b we investigated the formation of h on tio2 in aqueous solutions under the solar light by the photoluminescence pl technique using coumarine as a probe molecule 43 coumarine a poor fluorescent molecule could react with h to form the highly fluorescent 7 hydroxycoumarin 7hc the fluorescence emission generated by 7 hydroxycoumarin 7hc with a maximum peak around 456 nm fig 6 b confirms that the tio2 can efficiently generate hydroxyl radicals under that light condition to further investigate whether the hydroxyl radical is the only reactive species responsible for the rhodamine b reduction reactions on tio2 the photocatalytic reaction was conducted in the presence of glycerol a strong oh radical scavenger it can be seen from fig 6 a that in the presence of glycerol the photocatalytic efficiency of tio2 is significantly reduced this confirms that the oh is the major reactive oxygen species for rhodamine b degradation on tio2 this is important since the cleavage of rhodamine b by hydroxyl radical can result in dye mineralization to produce co2 and water which can be desorbed from the tio2 surface to vacate their active sites 43 44 the dye on the sponge surface can be degraded due to the photocatalytic action of tio2 promoting more adsorption of dye by the sponge from solution the photocatalytic reaction rate by nanocomposite was found to obey pseudo first order kinetics following langmuir hinshelwood model fig 7 a and b according to this model ln c0 c is a linear function of time 45 c0 is the initial dye concentration and c is the concentration of dye at a certain time the slope of the line represents the apparent rate constant for dye degradation this apparent rate constant is the product of the equilibrium constant for the adsorption of the dye on the catalyst surface and the reaction rate constant for the limiting rate of the reaction at the maximum coverage under the given set of experimental conditions the effect of initial dye concentration on the photocatalytic reaction rate shows that the degradation rate of rhodamine b initially slightly increased from 2 5 mg l concentration to 5 mg l but remain almost same with an increase in initial dye concentration to 10 mg l the observation can be explained as follows with the increase in dye concentration more dye molecules get adsorbed onto the catalyst increasing photocatalytic efficiency initially however with further increase in the dye concentration the dye molecules can mask the surface of the active sites thus preventing the light to reach the catalyst surface 45 in a typical textile dye waste effluent the concentration of dye can vary from 10 mg l to 100 mg l 46 47 further experiments were performed to investigate the effectiveness of the composite sponges for dye solution with concentration as high as 100 mg l the similar amount of the tio2 pdms sponges were used to treat a dye solution with the concentration of 100 mg ml the similar experimental conditions including overnight incubation and 1 h light solar light exposure were maintained it was found that with the increase in the dye concentration that high decreases the photocatalytic efficiency significantly fig 7 a tio2 pdms sponge can remove roughly 40 of dye from that solution due to the combined effect of adsorption and photocatalytic action and pdms sponge alone can remove 20 of the dye only by adsorption fig 7 c this shows that to make the composite sponges effective towards textile dye waste effluent with high dye concentration it may need to be treated by multiple batches of fresh tio2 composite sponge the reaction kinetics was compared for the composite sponges with different loading of tio2 to find out the optimum amount of the catalyst required for the maximum removal of dye from solution the initial concentration of rhodamine b 5 mg l was kept constant in all experiments the photocatalytic reaction rate increased with an increase in tio2 loading in the sponge fig 7 b this can be attributed to the increased number of available active sites for the photocatalytic reaction with an increase in the amount of the catalyst the photodegradation of dye with comparable amounts of tio2 in solution was studied to compare the efficiency of tio2 dispersed in pdms sponges with the efficiency of tio2 in solution in a typical experiment for 6 ml of the dye solution 1 4 gm of the composite sponge was used for the comparison 0 1 gm of neat tio2 was used to treat 6 ml of 5 mg l dye solution the amount of tio2 is equivalent to the total tio2 loaded in 1 4 gm sponge as a concentration of 71 μg gm as can be seen in fig 5 a tio2 alone removed a negligible amount of dye from solution by adsorption which was expected however the photocatalytic efficiency of the tio2 in solution is higher than that of the tio2 dispersed in the pdms sponge fig 7 b the overall dye removal efficiency of tio2 alone as compared to the tio2 pdms composite sponge was similar it should be noted that in spite of the similarity in total dye removal the composites boast three significant advantages over the catalyst alone first the material is effective even in the absence of light additionally the need to separate the catalyst from solution is eliminated lastly the material is recyclable as will be discussed in the following section 3 4 recyclability further experiments were pursued to test the possibility of recycling the composite sponge after completion of one trial the used tio2 pdms composite sponges were treated under the solar light until the dye in pdms sponge degraded due to the photocatalytic action of tio2 the sponges turn visibly white indicating the regeneration of the tio2 pdms sponges fig 8 a it should be noted that the sponges containing no catalyst were not recyclable presence of tio2 is important for the photodegradation of the remaining dye and making the sponge recyclable fig 8 b shows the absorbance spectra of used tio2 pdms sponges before and after their exposure to solar light it can be seen that in case of sponges with tio2 the dye concentration significantly decreased just after one hour of solar light exposure while the dye concentration in pdms sponges is negligibly affected by solar light exposure fig 8 c this confirms that the dye degradation is indeed due to the photocatalytic action of tio2 and not due to the photo bleaching effect no obvious adsorption band shift was observed this suggests that the dye degradation is mainly due to the efficient decomposition of the conjugated xanthene ring in rhodamine b 42 further experiment was conducted to find out the reactive oxygen species involved in the reactions glycerol a strong oh radical scavenger at a concentration of 2 mm was added to the aqueous solution in which the tio2 pdms sponge was suspended it was found that the rhodamine b degradation in the sponge was hindered in the presence of glycerol fig 8 d this indicates the importance of hydroxyl radical for rhodamine b decomposition by tio2 cleavage of rhodamine b by hydroxyl radical can results in dye mineralization to produce carbon di oxide and water which can be desorbed from the tio2 pdms sponge surface hence regenerating the active sites of tio2 this can be further confirmed by observation of efficient recyclability of tio2 pdms sponge fig 8 e there is a minimal loss of dye removal efficiency for the tio2 pdms sponge even after third use the sem images of the tio2 pdms sponge were captured before and after using the same sponge for three times fig 9 comparing the before and after images of the tio2 pdms the change in the amount of tio2 per unit surface area was found to be insignificant this indicates a negligible loss in catalysts from the sponge during the recycling process 4 conclusions we developed a pdms sponge nanocomposite containing tio2 which exhibits enhanced performance in the degradation and removal of organic pollutants such as rhodamine b from water in comparison to tio2 nanopowder or pdms sponge alone the nanocomposite can remove a part of the dye in solution by adsorption even in the absence of light in the presence of solar light the dye in the sponge is degraded due to the photocatalytic action of tio2 which allows the sponges to absorb more dye from the solution the enhanced performance can be attributed to the combined effect of the strong adsorption of organic molecules by the porous pdms coupled with photocatalytic degradation by tio2 utilizing the tio2 sponge for photodegradation of contaminants also eliminates the need to separate the catalyst from the solution after the fact the excellent performance and recyclability of the tio2 pdms sponge suggest its promise in applications in water treatment

sponge and 142 μg per gm of sponge did not influence the pore size significantly the tio2 was deposited on the pore wall and the surface of pdms sponge fig 2 c and 2 d tio2 particles are primarily present as aggregate roughly 100 nm 500 nm in size figs 2 c and d as shown in the edx spectrograph of tio2 pdms composite sponge in fig 2 e the characteristic peaks for titanium oxygen and silicon confirm the presence of tio2 on the pdms surface the additional peaks are representative of the sample preparation and indicate components of the substrate and coating both sem and tem images of tio2 catalyst in solution are shown in fig 3 as can be seen from both of the images the particles have aggregated in the solution which is expected as tio2 does not disperse well in water regardless of the lack of nano scale catalyst particles the as achieved tio2 pdms sponges exhibited enhanced performance towards removal of organic pollutants when compared to the tio2 directly dispersed in the solution 3 2 removal of dye from solution using sponges before the photocatalytic study the composite sponges are incubated in the dye solution and allowed to reach adsorption equilibrium which is achieved within one hour as can be seen in the plot in fig 4 the intensity of the absorbance peak at 550 nm representative of the rhodamine b concentration in solution decreases significantly after the sponges are allowed to soak in the solution overnight almost 60 of the dye was removed from solution due to the adsorption of dye by the pdms sponge however it does not exhibit significant further removal of dye when exposed to light fig 4 a addition of tio2 to pdms slightly decreased the adsorption of dye from the solution fig 4 b and fig 5 a the tio2 pdms sponge removes 40 dye only by the adsorption ultimately it can remove total 80 of the dye after 1 h exposure to sunlight due to photodegradation fig 4 b it should also be noted that only the sponge with tio2 can be recycled as the photocatalytic action of tio2 can help in breaking down the remaining dye in the sponge as expected the pure tio2 powder does not show any significant removal of dye by adsorption fig 5a the performance of sponges with different amount of tio2 was compared to understand the effect of tio2 concentration of the sponge on the removal of dye fig 5 a dye removal by overnight adsorption decreased from 50 to 43 as the tio2 concentration in the sponge increased from 35 μg per gram of sponge to 142 μg g this may be due to the decrease in pore volume with the addition of tio2 to the sponge however the sponges containing tio2 can degrade the dye under the solar light by photocatalytic action we can see that just after one hour of solar light exposure the dye removal by the sponges with a tio2 concentration of 71 μg g and 142 μg g exceeded the performance of plain pdms sponges the efficiencies of the dye removal by sponges with different initial dye concentration solutions are compared fig 5 b the dye removal efficiency by adsorption increased with increasing initial dye concentration from 2 5 mg l to 5 mg l whereas it remains almost similar when the concentration further increased to 10 mg l the driving force for mass transfer increased with increasing initial dye concentration promoting the transfer of dye molecules through the bulk solution to the sponge surface however further increase of dye concentration does not improve the adsorption efficiency because the number of vacant active sites was limited the number of active sites can be insufficient for the abundant dye molecules at higher concentration 40 3 3 photocatalytic degradation after the dye solution and sponge reached adsorption equilibrium in the dark it was exposed to solar light for 1 h the tio2 pdms composite sponge was expected to exhibit further removal of dye from the solution due to photocatalytic action of tio2 the relevant reactions at the tio2 surface causing the degradation of rhodamine b rhb dyes can be expressed as follows 41 1 tio 2 h ν uv tio 2 e cb h vb 2 tio 2 h vb h 2 o tio 2 h oh 3 tio 2 e c b o 2 tio 2 o 2 4 rhb oh degradation products 5 rhb h vb degradation products 6 rhb e cb degradation products rhodamine b contains four n ethyl groups at either side of the xanthene ring fig 1 a photodegradation of this dye molecule usually occurs via two competitive processes 1 n deethylation and 2 destruction of the conjugated structure 42 a hypsochromic shift of the adsorption band indicates the formation of a series of n deethylated intermediates however in our case no obvious adsorption band shift was observed in the case of photocatalytic reduction of rhodamine b using tio2 alone or tio2 pdms nanocomposite fig 4 b and fig 6 a this suggests that the dye degradation is mainly due to the efficient decomposition of the conjugated xanthene ring in rhodamine b as shown above the decomposition of rhodamine b can be initiated with positive holes hvb or surface bound oh or in the solution with superoxide anion o2 fig 1 c due to the strong oxidizing nature of oh radicals reaction step 4 has been predicted to be most important for the degradation of rhodamine b we investigated the formation of h on tio2 in aqueous solutions under the solar light by the photoluminescence pl technique using coumarine as a probe molecule 43 coumarine a poor fluorescent molecule could react with h to form the highly fluorescent 7 hydroxycoumarin 7hc the fluorescence emission generated by 7 hydroxycoumarin 7hc with a maximum peak around 456 nm fig 6 b confirms that the tio2 can efficiently generate hydroxyl radicals under that light condition to further investigate whether the hydroxyl radical is the only reactive species responsible for the rhodamine b reduction reactions on tio2 the photocatalytic reaction was conducted in the presence of glycerol a strong oh radical scavenger it can be seen from fig 6 a that in the presence of glycerol the photocatalytic efficiency of tio2 is significantly reduced this confirms that the oh is the major reactive oxygen species for rhodamine b degradation on tio2 this is important since the cleavage of rhodamine b by hydroxyl radical can result in dye mineralization to produce co2 and water which can be desorbed from the tio2 surface to vacate their active sites 43 44 the dye on the sponge surface can be degraded due to the photocatalytic action of tio2 promoting more adsorption of dye by the sponge from solution the photocatalytic reaction rate by nanocomposite was found to obey pseudo first order kinetics following langmuir hinshelwood model fig 7 a and b according to this model ln c0 c is a linear function of time 45 c0 is the initial dye concentration and c is the concentration of dye at a certain time the slope of the line represents the apparent rate constant for dye degradation this apparent rate constant is the product of the equilibrium constant for the adsorption of the dye on the catalyst surface and the reaction rate constant for the limiting rate of the reaction at the maximum coverage under the given set of experimental conditions the effect of initial dye concentration on the photocatalytic reaction rate shows that the degradation rate of rhodamine b initially slightly increased from 2 5 mg l concentration to 5 mg l but remain almost same with an increase in initial dye concentration to 10 mg l the observation can be explained as follows with the increase in dye concentration more dye molecules get adsorbed onto the catalyst increasing photocatalytic efficiency initially however with further increase in the dye concentration the dye molecules can mask the surface of the active sites thus preventing the light to reach the catalyst surface 45 in a typical textile dye waste effluent the concentration of dye can vary from 10 mg l to 100 mg l 46 47 further experiments were performed to investigate the effectiveness of the composite sponges for dye solution with concentration as high as 100 mg l the similar amount of the tio2 pdms sponges were used to treat a dye solution with the concentration of 100 mg ml the similar experimental conditions including overnight incubation and 1 h light solar light exposure were maintained it was found that with the increase in the dye concentration that high decreases the photocatalytic efficiency significantly fig 7 a tio2 pdms sponge can remove roughly 40 of dye from that solution due to the combined effect of adsorption and photocatalytic action and pdms sponge alone can remove 20 of the dye only by adsorption fig 7 c this shows that to make the composite sponges effective towards textile dye waste effluent with high dye concentration it may need to be treated by multiple batches of fresh tio2 composite sponge the reaction kinetics was compared for the composite sponges with different loading of tio2 to find out the optimum amount of the catalyst required for the maximum removal of dye from solution the initial concentration of rhodamine b 5 mg l was kept constant in all experiments the photocatalytic reaction rate increased with an increase in tio2 loading in the sponge fig 7 b this can be attributed to the increased number of available active sites for the photocatalytic reaction with an increase in the amount of the catalyst the photodegradation of dye with comparable amounts of tio2 in solution was studied to compare the efficiency of tio2 dispersed in pdms sponges with the efficiency of tio2 in solution in a typical experiment for 6 ml of the dye solution 1 4 gm of the composite sponge was used for the comparison 0 1 gm of neat tio2 was used to treat 6 ml of 5 mg l dye solution the amount of tio2 is equivalent to the total tio2 loaded in 1 4 gm sponge as a concentration of 71 μg gm as can be seen in fig 5 a tio2 alone removed a negligible amount of dye from solution by adsorption which was expected however the photocatalytic efficiency of the tio2 in solution is higher than that of the tio2 dispersed in the pdms sponge fig 7 b the overall dye removal efficiency of tio2 alone as compared to the tio2 pdms composite sponge was similar it should be noted that in spite of the similarity in total dye removal the composites boast three significant advantages over the catalyst alone first the material is effective even in the absence of light additionally the need to separate the catalyst from solution is eliminated lastly the material is recyclable as will be discussed in the following section 3 4 recyclability further experiments were pursued to test the possibility of recycling the composite sponge after completion of one trial the used tio2 pdms composite sponges were treated under the solar light until the dye in pdms sponge degraded due to the photocatalytic action of tio2 the sponges turn visibly white indicating the regeneration of the tio2 pdms sponges fig 8 a it should be noted that the sponges containing no catalyst were not recyclable presence of tio2 is important for the photodegradation of the remaining dye and making the sponge recyclable fig 8 b shows the absorbance spectra of used tio2 pdms sponges before and after their exposure to solar light it can be seen that in case of sponges with tio2 the dye concentration significantly decreased just after one hour of solar light exposure while the dye concentration in pdms sponges is negligibly affected by solar light exposure fig 8 c this confirms that the dye degradation is indeed due to the photocatalytic action of tio2 and not due to the photo bleaching effect no obvious adsorption band shift was observed this suggests that the dye degradation is mainly due to the efficient decomposition of the conjugated xanthene ring in rhodamine b 42 further experiment was conducted to find out the reactive oxygen species involved in the reactions glycerol a strong oh radical scavenger at a concentration of 2 mm was added to the aqueous solution in which the tio2 pdms sponge was suspended it was found that the rhodamine b degradation in the sponge was hindered in the presence of glycerol fig 8 d this indicates the importance of hydroxyl radical for rhodamine b decomposition by tio2 cleavage of rhodamine b by hydroxyl radical can results in dye mineralization to produce carbon di oxide and water which can be desorbed from the tio2 pdms sponge surface hence regenerating the active sites of tio2 this can be further confirmed by observation of efficient recyclability of tio2 pdms sponge fig 8 e there is a minimal loss of dye removal efficiency for the tio2 pdms sponge even after third use the sem images of the tio2 pdms sponge were captured before and after using the same sponge for three times fig 9 comparing the before and after images of the tio2 pdms the change in the amount of tio2 per unit surface area was found to be insignificant this indicates a negligible loss in catalysts from the sponge during the recycling process 4 conclusions we developed a pdms sponge nanocomposite containing tio2 which exhibits enhanced performance in the degradation and removal of organic pollutants such as rhodamine b from water in comparison to tio2 nanopowder or pdms sponge alone the nanocomposite can remove a part of the dye in solution by adsorption even in the absence of light in the presence of solar light the dye in the sponge is degraded due to the photocatalytic action of tio2 which allows the sponges to absorb more dye from the solution the enhanced performance can be attributed to the combined effect of the strong adsorption of organic molecules by the porous pdms coupled with photocatalytic degradation by tio2 utilizing the tio2 sponge for photodegradation of contaminants also eliminates the need to separate the catalyst from the solution after the fact the excellent performance and recyclability of the tio2 pdms sponge suggest its promise in applications in water treatment

14541,as graphene like materials are demonstrated as non metal catalysts to activate persulfate psf peroxymonosulfate pms co doping sulfur and nitrogen with graphene is a promising approach to improve catalytic activities in this study a convenient one step approach is adopted to prepare sulfur doped graphitic carbon nitride scn which shows crumpled morphology and porosity on its surface making scn exhibit a much higher surface area than the common cn chemical analyses also confirm that a part of n atoms in cn skeleton are substituted by s to evaluate psf pms activation by scn decolorization of rhodamine b rhb is selected as a model test scn showed a much higher catalytic activity than carbon nitride cn to activate psf pms for rhb decolorization behaviors of psf pms activation by scn are explored by evaluating various effects on rhb decolorization including temperature ph and salt scn activated psf pms for rhb decolorization is much favorable at elevated temperatures and neutral conditions the presence of nacl does not significantly inhibit the psf pms activation by scn several radical inhibitors on scn activated pms are also evaluated and the rhb mechanism is shown to involve both sulfate and hydroxyl radicals potential mechanisms of psf pms activation by scn are proposed and ascribed to the more active carbon sites of scn induced by the co dopants of sulfur and nitrogen scn can be also re used to activate psf pms without catalytic activity loss these features demonstrate that scn is a conveniently prepared but effective and sustainable non metal heterogeneous catalyst for activating psf pms keywords sulfur carbon nitride persulfate peroxymonosulfate rhodamine b 1 introduction wet chemical oxidation wco is an extensively employed reaction for chemical synthesis 1 as well as environmental remediation 2 in particular processes of wco for treating organic contaminants are categorized as advanced oxidation processes aops 2 aops generally involve two high oxidation potential radicals hydroxyl oh and sulfate radicals so4 3 while oh involved aops have been intensively used so4 involved aops are also increasingly developed owing to several advantageous features of so4 including comparable higher oxidation power higher selectivity towards aromatic contaminants and longer half life 4 generally sulfate radicals are derived from strong oxidants such as persulfate psf and peroxymonosulfate pms which are commercially available and environmentally friendly 4 therefore psf and pms have been employed in many applications such as organic synthesis 5 disinfection 6 and environmental pollution control 4 nevertheless the generation of so4 from self decomposition of psf pms is quite slow therefore catalysts are required to activate psf pms several transition metals e g cobalt copper iron and manganese have been proposed to activate psf pms however usage of homogeneous or heterogeneous transition metallic catalysts inevitably leads to secondary pollutions and relatively high costs environmental impacts thus recently a number of non metal heterogeneous catalysts are proposed including carbonaceous 7 graphene based materials 8 graphitic carbon nitride cn 9 boron 10 and α sulfur 11 in general activation of pms psf by non metal catalysts is considered to involve two types of mechanisms in the first type of mechanism pms psf is activated by highly active species e g oxygenic groups of carbonaceous materials nitrogen sulfur groups doped in carbonaceous materials and defective sites by receiving electrons 7 10 12 14 the second type of mechanism of pms psf activation is associated with the introduction of photo generated active species derived from photocatalytic non metal photocatalysts e g α sulfur and carbon nitride under light irradiation 11 14 16 since the light irradiation may involve additional energy input and relatively complicated protocols it would be more attractive and practical to create efficient non metal catalysts for activating psf pms even without visible or uv light irradiation as doping non metal elements e g b p n or s with graphene like materials i e graphene and cn is considered as a useful technique to enhance their reactivity 12 duan et al demonstrated that co doping of sulfur and nitrogen with graphene significantly improved catalytic activity of graphene for activating pms to degrade organic pollutants 8 even though these heteroatom doped graphene like materials are promising preparation of these materials is relatively complicated and involving multiple steps and reagents 8 to reduce preparation time and associated costs as well as environmental impacts it is necessary to develop easy to prepare heteroatom doped graphene like materials herein a commercial available compound consisting of carbon nitrogen and sulfur trithiocyanuric acid is selected and used as a precursor for preparing such a sulfur nitrogen co doped graphene like material through one step heat treatment trithiocyanuric acid can be conveniently converted to sulfur doped graphitic carbon nitride scn 17 18 the resulting scn is expected to exhibit relatively high reactivity and becomes a non metal heterogeneous catalyst to react with pms as well as psf for generation of sulfur radicals even in the absence of light irradiation to investigate catalytic activity of scn for activating psf pms decolorization of a toxic dye rhodamine b rhb is selected as a model test to evaluate sulfate radicals derived from psf pms activated by scn the reason for selecting rhb as a representative contaminant in this study is because rhb is potentially carcinogenic and frequently used in degradation studies using sulfate radial based processes 15 19 21 behaviors of psf pms activation by scn are explored through examining various effects on rhb decolorization including temperature ph and co existing ions effects of radical inhibitors are also examined to reveal the decolorization mechanism by scn activated psf pms a potential mechanism for scn to activate psf pms is also proposed based on the chemical configuration of scn reusability of scn for activating psf pms is evaluated by re using scn multiple times without regeneration treatments 2 experimental 2 1 synthesis and characterization of scn scn was prepared according to reported protocols 17 18 in brief trithiocyanuric acid alfa aesar usa was placed in a ceramic crucible and heated at 550 c in n2 atmosphere for 4 h to obtain scn powders to compare with scn undoped cn was also prepared by the same procedure using melamine powder sigma aldrich usa as a precursor scn was first characterized by a field emission sem jeol jsm 6700 japan and a tem jeol jem 2010 japan to visualize its morphology the xrd pattern of scn was measured using an x ray diffractometer panalytical the netherlands chemical characteristics of scn were determined by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps phi 5000 ulvac phi inc japan n2 sorption and desorption isotherms of scn were obtained using a volumetric gas adsorption analyzer quantachrome auto iq usa zeta potential of scn was also measured by a zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments ltd malvern uk 2 2 psf pms activation by scn for decolorization of rhodamine b rhb to evaluate catalytic activity of scn for activating psf pms batch type decolorization of a toxic dye rhodamine b rhb was selected as a model reaction in a typical experiment psf pms powder 300 mg l 1 sigma aldrich usa was added to 0 2 l of rhb aqueous solution with an initial concentration c0 of 10 mg l 1 upon the dissolution of psf pms powder scn powder 500 mg l 1 was then added to the rhb solution the mixture was stirred and its temperature was maintained at a fixed temperature as scn is a semiconductor 22 decolorization experiments were performed inside a customized dark room to prevent photocatalytic reactions induced by scn at pre set intervals sample aliquots were taken from the batch reactor and the residual rhb concentration ct mg l 1 was measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer effects of radical inhibitors were also investigated to reveal the rhb decolorization mechanism by scn activated psf pms the inhibitors included methanol 0 2 m and tert butyl alcohol tba 0 2 m the reusability of scn was evaluated by continuously using scn for activating psf pms without regenerating scn through examining the reusability of scn the stability and catalytic activity of scn over long term operation can be determined in the typical experiment of reusability the used scn sample is recovered from solutions via centrifugation and then added to a subsequent batch experiment without washing treating the used scn by any means 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of scn fig 1 a reveals that scn sheets are crumpled as other studies reported 18 23 however the thin layer of scn sheets can be still observed on the edge of crumpled scn a tem image of scn fig 1 b shows that the crumpled scn appear to be hollow with roughened surfaces and pores fig 1 c displays the crystalline structure of scn in which two prominent peaks can be detected at 13 3 and 27 2 corresponding to 100 of the in plane packing and 002 of the lamellar stacking of scn 22 respectively the textural properties of scn are also determined using n2 sorption isotherms fig 1 d which seem to be the iupac type iii isotherm with a noticeable hysteresis loop this suggests that crumpled scn might exhibit mesopores which can be validated by the pore size distribution shown in the inset in fig 1 d confirming the porous texture of scn this crumpled and porous structure of scn enables scn to exhibit a much higher surface area as 86 8 m2 g 1 than typical cn ca 10 m2 g 1 23 surface chemistry of scn was also determined by xps as displayed in fig 2 a full survey spectrum of scn fig 2 a reveals that scn comprised carbon nitrogen as well as sulfur in particular the core level spectrum of c 1s fig 2 b can be deconvoluted to display two peaks at 285 0 and 288 0 ev attributed to cc bond and the sp2 bonded carbon of ncn respectively the core level spectrum of n 1s fig 2 c can be also deconvoluted to show two peaks at 398 5 and 399 8 ev corresponding to the sp2 hybridized aromatic n bonded to carbon i e cnc and the tertiary n bonded to carbon i e n c 3 or hn c 2 respectively 24 on the other hand the core level spectrum of s 2p fig 2 d can be deconvoluted to exhibit two peaks at 163 9 and 164 6 ev the peak at 163 9 ev is attributed to cs bond in which s substituted n atoms in cn skeleton 25 the peak at 164 6 ev can be ascribed to the sulfur species in the bond of csc 25 these peaks validate that cn was doped with sulfur to form scn surface property of scn was further revealed by measuring the zeta potential of scn fig s1 see esi shows that the surface of scn became negatively charged starting from ph 4 and continued to decrease at higher ph values indicating that scn is highly negatively charged to compare scn with the undoped cn cn was also prepared and its xrd pattern fig s2 a is consistent with reported patterns jcpds card 87 1526 the xps analysis of cn fig s2 b also confirms the formation of cn 24 3 2 decolorization of rhb by scn activated psf pms and its mechanism prior to evaluating scn for activating psf pms it is necessary to determine whether scn can decolorize rhb via adsorption fig 3 a shows that rhb was not decolorized in the presence of scn suggesting that scn did not exhibit a strong affinity towards rhb when psf alone was present rhb was slightly decolorized as ct c0 approaches 0 82 this indicates that psf itself might self decompose to generate sulfate radicals for rhb decolorization however the decolorization extent was quite low suggesting that proper activation of psf is still required once both psf and scn were present the decolorization became noticeably faster and ct c0 approaches 0 55 as scn almost did not adsorb rhb this result suggests that scn activated psf and facilitated decomposition of psf to generate more sulfate radicals for rhb decolorization to reveal the effect of sulfur doping cn without sulfur was combined with psf for rhb decolorization in fig 3 a the corresponding rhb decolorization extent was higher than that by psf alone indicating that cn was also able to facilitate decomposition of psf however scn seemed to be more effective for activating psf for rhb decolorization demonstrating the positive effect of sulfur doping on the other hand rhb decolorization by pms itself was also evaluated as shown in fig 3 b even though rhb was slightly decolorized by pms pms without activation by catalysts was quite slow and ineffective once scn was combined with pms rhb was fully decolorized in 80 min as both pms and scn could not efficiently decolorize rhb individually this result suggests that pms was also activated by scn in comparison with scn cn was also combined with pms to decolorize rhb while cn seemed to activate pms as ct c0 reached 0 5 at 120 min the decolorization extent and kinetics were obviously lower and slower respectively than those obtained by the combination of scn and pms these results demonstrate that scn was capable of activating psf and pms to generate radicals for rhb decolorization however scn appears to be a more favorable catalyst for activation of pms 3 3 potential mechanisms for activation of psf pms by scn while scn activated psf and pms and exhibited a higher catalytic activity than cn it was essential to understand how scn activated psf pms and what the role of sulfur doping played in enhancing catalytic activity previous studies have indicated that carbonaceous and graphene like materials are able to activate psf pms by obtaining and releasing electrons through surface reactions between psf pms and these carbon based materials as follows 7 1 s2o8 2 e so4 so4 2 2 s2o8 2 e s2o8 3 hso5 e so4 oh 4 hso5 e so5 h then so5 may transform to so4 based on the following reaction eq 5 5 2 so5 2 so4 o2 according to these reactions scn activated pms is expected to generate more sulfate radicals so4 than scn activated psf thus a much higher rhb decolorization extent and kinetics were achieved by scn activated pms on the other hand while carbon and graphene like materials are proven to activate psf pms sulfur doping has been reported to decrease energy difference of graphene like materials between the highest unoccupied molecular orbital homo and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo because sulfur possesses a similar electronegativity i e 2 58 to that of carbon i e 2 55 26 dopants of sulfur distributed on zigzag edges of graphene like materials are shown to induce a relatively high spin and charge density to adjacent carbon atoms developing more active sites for catalytic reactions 27 on the other hand nitrogen possessing a relatively high electronegativity i e 3 04 is considered to facilitate electron transfer from adjacent carbon resulting in a high charge density of carbon atoms thus quaternary nitrogen is also reported as active sites for catalytic oxidation reactions 28 in addition a number of recent studies report co dopants of sulfur and nitrogen can exhibit synergistic effects as a result of the re distribution of spin and charge densities and resultant more active sites 8 29 31 duan et al demonstrated that the dopant of nitrogen induced a high positive charge density of adjacent carbon of graphene while the co dopants of sulfur and nitrogen led to an even higher positive charge density of adjacent carbon 8 thereby increasing catalytic activity of scn for activating psf pms the synergy of sulfur nitrogen co doping can disrupt the inertness of carbon and then facilitate the electron transfer from graphene like materials to psf pms anions for activating psf pms 8 thus scn activated psf pms was more effective than cn activated psf pms for rhb decolorization as shown in fig 3 a and b a scheme is also provided in fig 4 in order to illustrate the above mentioned mechanism for activating psf pms by scn to decolorize rhb 3 4 effects of temperature and ph on rhb decolorization to further investigate metal free activation of psf pms by scn the effect of temperature on rhb decolorization was examined fig 3 c shows rhb decolorization by scn activated psf at 20 40 and 60 c the decolorization extent was substantially improved at elevated temperatures the decolorization kinetics was also analyzed using the pseudo first order rate law as follows eq 6 6 c t c 0 exp k a p p t where kapp is the apparent first order rate constant of rhb decolorization table s1 see the supporting information summarizes kapp values of rhb decolorization at different temperatures when kapp was 0 005 min 1 at 20 c it increased to 0 010 and 0 014 min 1 at 40 and 60 c respectively revealing the positive effect of elevated temperatures on the other hand fig 3 d shows that rhb was fully decolorized by scn activated pms at all testing temperatures 20 40 and 60 c when temperature increased from 20 to 40 and 60 c the kinetics of rhb decolorization was considerably accelerated as kapp increased from 0 062 to 0 200 and 0 390 min 1 respectively these results validate that scn activated psf pms can be much enhanced at elevated temperatures 32 furthermore as activation of psf pms is an aqueous solution ph is a critical parameter fig 5 a reveals rhb decolorization by scn activated psf at ph 4 7 and 11 while rhb decolorization at ph 3 remained comparable to that at ph 7 the decolorization extent was negatively affected at ph 11 a similar result was obtained in the case of scn activated pms the decolorization extent considerably decreased at ph 11 whereas that was slightly influenced at ph 4 these results reveal that rhb decolorization by scn activated psf pms was unfavorable under basic conditions possibly because psf and pms tend to decompose without the generation of sulfate radicals under basic conditions 33 35 slowing rhb decolorization on the other hand pms is relatively stable under acidic conditions 35 thereby leading to a slightly lower decolorization as seen in fig 5 b another possibility for the lower decolorization extent obtained by scn activated pms under basic conditions is that the surface charge of scn became even more negative due to the deposition of hydroxyl ions oh the access of so5 to the negatively charged scn was constrained and the transformation from so5 to so4 could be suppressed according to eq 5 36 3 5 effect of nacl on rhb decolorization using scn activated psf pms as wastewater typically contains ions these ions may influence psf pms activation to evaluate effects of ions a model salt nacl was added to rhb solutions for examining its effect fig 5 c reveals that 200 mg l 1 of nacl in rhb solution slightly slowed the rhb decolorization using scn activated psf the adverse effect became even more pronounced when nacl concentration increased to 600 mg l 1 a similar phenomenon was observed in the case of rhb decolorization using scn activated pms fig 5 d these results suggest that the presence of nacl slightly hindered rhb decolorization by scn activated psf pms it has been reported that chloride ions can react with sulfate radicals to result in chlorine radicals via the following equations eqs 7 and 8 36 7 cl so4 cl so4 2 8 cl cl cl2 consequently the addition of nacl might consume a part of sulfate radicals generated from scn activated psf pms thereby slowing the decolorization kinetics nevertheless one should note that the concentration of nacl adopted here is much higher than the rhb concentration i e 10 mg l 1 however scn activated psf pms still remained quite effective to decolorize rhb 3 6 effects of inhibitors on rhb decolorization using scn activated psf pms as sulfate radicals are expected to occur during scn activated psf pms sulfate radicals may react with water to generate hydroxyl radicals oh via the following equation 37 eq 9 9 so4 h2o so4 2 oh h thus it is important to distinguish which radicals contributed to decolorization of rhb to do so a particular radical inhibitor for oh tba was added to rhb solutions fig 6 a indicates that rhb decolorization was noticeably slowed in the presence of tba suggesting that rhb decolorization by scn activated psf involved with oh on the other another radical inhibitor methanol was also examined as methanol is a probe reagent for both so4 and oh 38 the corresponding rhb decolorization was influenced even negatively revealing that so4 also participated in rhb decolorization by scn activated psf these results validate that rhb decolorization can be attributed to both so4 and oh on the other hand the effects of inhibitors on rhb decolorization by scn activated pms can be seen in fig 6 b while tba slowed the decolorization slightly the adverse effect of methanol was relatively pronounced thus the decolorization by scn activated pms was primarily due to so4 and oh to a lesser extent these results reveal that a certain amount of oh derived from scn activated psf pms contributed to rhb decolorization 3 7 reusability of scn for activating psf pms to decolorize rhb as scn is proposed to be a sustainable non metal catalyst for activating psf pms its reusability is also an essential aspect fig 6 c and d display decolorization efficiencies of rhb defined as 1 ct c0 over 6 cycles by using re used scn to activate psf pms while the decolorization extent by scn activated psf was still lower than that by scn activated psf decolorization efficiency remained almost the same over 6 cycles the decolorization efficiency of scn activated pms was also quite stable without significant loss over 6 cycles this demonstrates that scn is a promising and sustainable material which can be re used without regeneration treatments and remains effective for activating psf pms 4 conclusion in this study a sulfur doped carbon nitride scn was prepared via one step heat treatment of trithiocyanuric acid and used for the first time as a non metal catalyst to activate psf pms even without light irradiation the resulting scn exhibited the crumpled morphology and porosity on its surface allowing it to possess a much higher surface area than typical undoped cn as rhb decolorization was selected as a model test to evaluate psf pms activation scn also showed a much higher catalytic activity than cn to activate psf pms for rhb

14541,as graphene like materials are demonstrated as non metal catalysts to activate persulfate psf peroxymonosulfate pms co doping sulfur and nitrogen with graphene is a promising approach to improve catalytic activities in this study a convenient one step approach is adopted to prepare sulfur doped graphitic carbon nitride scn which shows crumpled morphology and porosity on its surface making scn exhibit a much higher surface area than the common cn chemical analyses also confirm that a part of n atoms in cn skeleton are substituted by s to evaluate psf pms activation by scn decolorization of rhodamine b rhb is selected as a model test scn showed a much higher catalytic activity than carbon nitride cn to activate psf pms for rhb decolorization behaviors of psf pms activation by scn are explored by evaluating various effects on rhb decolorization including temperature ph and salt scn activated psf pms for rhb decolorization is much favorable at elevated temperatures and neutral conditions the presence of nacl does not significantly inhibit the psf pms activation by scn several radical inhibitors on scn activated pms are also evaluated and the rhb mechanism is shown to involve both sulfate and hydroxyl radicals potential mechanisms of psf pms activation by scn are proposed and ascribed to the more active carbon sites of scn induced by the co dopants of sulfur and nitrogen scn can be also re used to activate psf pms without catalytic activity loss these features demonstrate that scn is a conveniently prepared but effective and sustainable non metal heterogeneous catalyst for activating psf pms keywords sulfur carbon nitride persulfate peroxymonosulfate rhodamine b 1 introduction wet chemical oxidation wco is an extensively employed reaction for chemical synthesis 1 as well as environmental remediation 2 in particular processes of wco for treating organic contaminants are categorized as advanced oxidation processes aops 2 aops generally involve two high oxidation potential radicals hydroxyl oh and sulfate radicals so4 3 while oh involved aops have been intensively used so4 involved aops are also increasingly developed owing to several advantageous features of so4 including comparable higher oxidation power higher selectivity towards aromatic contaminants and longer half life 4 generally sulfate radicals are derived from strong oxidants such as persulfate psf and peroxymonosulfate pms which are commercially available and environmentally friendly 4 therefore psf and pms have been employed in many applications such as organic synthesis 5 disinfection 6 and environmental pollution control 4 nevertheless the generation of so4 from self decomposition of psf pms is quite slow therefore catalysts are required to activate psf pms several transition metals e g cobalt copper iron and manganese have been proposed to activate psf pms however usage of homogeneous or heterogeneous transition metallic catalysts inevitably leads to secondary pollutions and relatively high costs environmental impacts thus recently a number of non metal heterogeneous catalysts are proposed including carbonaceous 7 graphene based materials 8 graphitic carbon nitride cn 9 boron 10 and α sulfur 11 in general activation of pms psf by non metal catalysts is considered to involve two types of mechanisms in the first type of mechanism pms psf is activated by highly active species e g oxygenic groups of carbonaceous materials nitrogen sulfur groups doped in carbonaceous materials and defective sites by receiving electrons 7 10 12 14 the second type of mechanism of pms psf activation is associated with the introduction of photo generated active species derived from photocatalytic non metal photocatalysts e g α sulfur and carbon nitride under light irradiation 11 14 16 since the light irradiation may involve additional energy input and relatively complicated protocols it would be more attractive and practical to create efficient non metal catalysts for activating psf pms even without visible or uv light irradiation as doping non metal elements e g b p n or s with graphene like materials i e graphene and cn is considered as a useful technique to enhance their reactivity 12 duan et al demonstrated that co doping of sulfur and nitrogen with graphene significantly improved catalytic activity of graphene for activating pms to degrade organic pollutants 8 even though these heteroatom doped graphene like materials are promising preparation of these materials is relatively complicated and involving multiple steps and reagents 8 to reduce preparation time and associated costs as well as environmental impacts it is necessary to develop easy to prepare heteroatom doped graphene like materials herein a commercial available compound consisting of carbon nitrogen and sulfur trithiocyanuric acid is selected and used as a precursor for preparing such a sulfur nitrogen co doped graphene like material through one step heat treatment trithiocyanuric acid can be conveniently converted to sulfur doped graphitic carbon nitride scn 17 18 the resulting scn is expected to exhibit relatively high reactivity and becomes a non metal heterogeneous catalyst to react with pms as well as psf for generation of sulfur radicals even in the absence of light irradiation to investigate catalytic activity of scn for activating psf pms decolorization of a toxic dye rhodamine b rhb is selected as a model test to evaluate sulfate radicals derived from psf pms activated by scn the reason for selecting rhb as a representative contaminant in this study is because rhb is potentially carcinogenic and frequently used in degradation studies using sulfate radial based processes 15 19 21 behaviors of psf pms activation by scn are explored through examining various effects on rhb decolorization including temperature ph and co existing ions effects of radical inhibitors are also examined to reveal the decolorization mechanism by scn activated psf pms a potential mechanism for scn to activate psf pms is also proposed based on the chemical configuration of scn reusability of scn for activating psf pms is evaluated by re using scn multiple times without regeneration treatments 2 experimental 2 1 synthesis and characterization of scn scn was prepared according to reported protocols 17 18 in brief trithiocyanuric acid alfa aesar usa was placed in a ceramic crucible and heated at 550 c in n2 atmosphere for 4 h to obtain scn powders to compare with scn undoped cn was also prepared by the same procedure using melamine powder sigma aldrich usa as a precursor scn was first characterized by a field emission sem jeol jsm 6700 japan and a tem jeol jem 2010 japan to visualize its morphology the xrd pattern of scn was measured using an x ray diffractometer panalytical the netherlands chemical characteristics of scn were determined by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps phi 5000 ulvac phi inc japan n2 sorption and desorption isotherms of scn were obtained using a volumetric gas adsorption analyzer quantachrome auto iq usa zeta potential of scn was also measured by a zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments ltd malvern uk 2 2 psf pms activation by scn for decolorization of rhodamine b rhb to evaluate catalytic activity of scn for activating psf pms batch type decolorization of a toxic dye rhodamine b rhb was selected as a model reaction in a typical experiment psf pms powder 300 mg l 1 sigma aldrich usa was added to 0 2 l of rhb aqueous solution with an initial concentration c0 of 10 mg l 1 upon the dissolution of psf pms powder scn powder 500 mg l 1 was then added to the rhb solution the mixture was stirred and its temperature was maintained at a fixed temperature as scn is a semiconductor 22 decolorization experiments were performed inside a customized dark room to prevent photocatalytic reactions induced by scn at pre set intervals sample aliquots were taken from the batch reactor and the residual rhb concentration ct mg l 1 was measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer effects of radical inhibitors were also investigated to reveal the rhb decolorization mechanism by scn activated psf pms the inhibitors included methanol 0 2 m and tert butyl alcohol tba 0 2 m the reusability of scn was evaluated by continuously using scn for activating psf pms without regenerating scn through examining the reusability of scn the stability and catalytic activity of scn over long term operation can be determined in the typical experiment of reusability the used scn sample is recovered from solutions via centrifugation and then added to a subsequent batch experiment without washing treating the used scn by any means 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of scn fig 1 a reveals that scn sheets are crumpled as other studies reported 18 23 however the thin layer of scn sheets can be still observed on the edge of crumpled scn a tem image of scn fig 1 b shows that the crumpled scn appear to be hollow with roughened surfaces and pores fig 1 c displays the crystalline structure of scn in which two prominent peaks can be detected at 13 3 and 27 2 corresponding to 100 of the in plane packing and 002 of the lamellar stacking of scn 22 respectively the textural properties of scn are also determined using n2 sorption isotherms fig 1 d which seem to be the iupac type iii isotherm with a noticeable hysteresis loop this suggests that crumpled scn might exhibit mesopores which can be validated by the pore size distribution shown in the inset in fig 1 d confirming the porous texture of scn this crumpled and porous structure of scn enables scn to exhibit a much higher surface area as 86 8 m2 g 1 than typical cn ca 10 m2 g 1 23 surface chemistry of scn was also determined by xps as displayed in fig 2 a full survey spectrum of scn fig 2 a reveals that scn comprised carbon nitrogen as well as sulfur in particular the core level spectrum of c 1s fig 2 b can be deconvoluted to display two peaks at 285 0 and 288 0 ev attributed to cc bond and the sp2 bonded carbon of ncn respectively the core level spectrum of n 1s fig 2 c can be also deconvoluted to show two peaks at 398 5 and 399 8 ev corresponding to the sp2 hybridized aromatic n bonded to carbon i e cnc and the tertiary n bonded to carbon i e n c 3 or hn c 2 respectively 24 on the other hand the core level spectrum of s 2p fig 2 d can be deconvoluted to exhibit two peaks at 163 9 and 164 6 ev the peak at 163 9 ev is attributed to cs bond in which s substituted n atoms in cn skeleton 25 the peak at 164 6 ev can be ascribed to the sulfur species in the bond of csc 25 these peaks validate that cn was doped with sulfur to form scn surface property of scn was further revealed by measuring the zeta potential of scn fig s1 see esi shows that the surface of scn became negatively charged starting from ph 4 and continued to decrease at higher ph values indicating that scn is highly negatively charged to compare scn with the undoped cn cn was also prepared and its xrd pattern fig s2 a is consistent with reported patterns jcpds card 87 1526 the xps analysis of cn fig s2 b also confirms the formation of cn 24 3 2 decolorization of rhb by scn activated psf pms and its mechanism prior to evaluating scn for activating psf pms it is necessary to determine whether scn can decolorize rhb via adsorption fig 3 a shows that rhb was not decolorized in the presence of scn suggesting that scn did not exhibit a strong affinity towards rhb when psf alone was present rhb was slightly decolorized as ct c0 approaches 0 82 this indicates that psf itself might self decompose to generate sulfate radicals for rhb decolorization however the decolorization extent was quite low suggesting that proper activation of psf is still required once both psf and scn were present the decolorization became noticeably faster and ct c0 approaches 0 55 as scn almost did not adsorb rhb this result suggests that scn activated psf and facilitated decomposition of psf to generate more sulfate radicals for rhb decolorization to reveal the effect of sulfur doping cn without sulfur was combined with psf for rhb decolorization in fig 3 a the corresponding rhb decolorization extent was higher than that by psf alone indicating that cn was also able to facilitate decomposition of psf however scn seemed to be more effective for activating psf for rhb decolorization demonstrating the positive effect of sulfur doping on the other hand rhb decolorization by pms itself was also evaluated as shown in fig 3 b even though rhb was slightly decolorized by pms pms without activation by catalysts was quite slow and ineffective once scn was combined with pms rhb was fully decolorized in 80 min as both pms and scn could not efficiently decolorize rhb individually this result suggests that pms was also activated by scn in comparison with scn cn was also combined with pms to decolorize rhb while cn seemed to activate pms as ct c0 reached 0 5 at 120 min the decolorization extent and kinetics were obviously lower and slower respectively than those obtained by the combination of scn and pms these results demonstrate that scn was capable of activating psf and pms to generate radicals for rhb decolorization however scn appears to be a more favorable catalyst for activation of pms 3 3 potential mechanisms for activation of psf pms by scn while scn activated psf and pms and exhibited a higher catalytic activity than cn it was essential to understand how scn activated psf pms and what the role of sulfur doping played in enhancing catalytic activity previous studies have indicated that carbonaceous and graphene like materials are able to activate psf pms by obtaining and releasing electrons through surface reactions between psf pms and these carbon based materials as follows 7 1 s2o8 2 e so4 so4 2 2 s2o8 2 e s2o8 3 hso5 e so4 oh 4 hso5 e so5 h then so5 may transform to so4 based on the following reaction eq 5 5 2 so5 2 so4 o2 according to these reactions scn activated pms is expected to generate more sulfate radicals so4 than scn activated psf thus a much higher rhb decolorization extent and kinetics were achieved by scn activated pms on the other hand while carbon and graphene like materials are proven to activate psf pms sulfur doping has been reported to decrease energy difference of graphene like materials between the highest unoccupied molecular orbital homo and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo because sulfur possesses a similar electronegativity i e 2 58 to that of carbon i e 2 55 26 dopants of sulfur distributed on zigzag edges of graphene like materials are shown to induce a relatively high spin and charge density to adjacent carbon atoms developing more active sites for catalytic reactions 27 on the other hand nitrogen possessing a relatively high electronegativity i e 3 04 is considered to facilitate electron transfer from adjacent carbon resulting in a high charge density of carbon atoms thus quaternary nitrogen is also reported as active sites for catalytic oxidation reactions 28 in addition a number of recent studies report co dopants of sulfur and nitrogen can exhibit synergistic effects as a result of the re distribution of spin and charge densities and resultant more active sites 8 29 31 duan et al demonstrated that the dopant of nitrogen induced a high positive charge density of adjacent carbon of graphene while the co dopants of sulfur and nitrogen led to an even higher positive charge density of adjacent carbon 8 thereby increasing catalytic activity of scn for activating psf pms the synergy of sulfur nitrogen co doping can disrupt the inertness of carbon and then facilitate the electron transfer from graphene like materials to psf pms anions for activating psf pms 8 thus scn activated psf pms was more effective than cn activated psf pms for rhb decolorization as shown in fig 3 a and b a scheme is also provided in fig 4 in order to illustrate the above mentioned mechanism for activating psf pms by scn to decolorize rhb 3 4 effects of temperature and ph on rhb decolorization to further investigate metal free activation of psf pms by scn the effect of temperature on rhb decolorization was examined fig 3 c shows rhb decolorization by scn activated psf at 20 40 and 60 c the decolorization extent was substantially improved at elevated temperatures the decolorization kinetics was also analyzed using the pseudo first order rate law as follows eq 6 6 c t c 0 exp k a p p t where kapp is the apparent first order rate constant of rhb decolorization table s1 see the supporting information summarizes kapp values of rhb decolorization at different temperatures when kapp was 0 005 min 1 at 20 c it increased to 0 010 and 0 014 min 1 at 40 and 60 c respectively revealing the positive effect of elevated temperatures on the other hand fig 3 d shows that rhb was fully decolorized by scn activated pms at all testing temperatures 20 40 and 60 c when temperature increased from 20 to 40 and 60 c the kinetics of rhb decolorization was considerably accelerated as kapp increased from 0 062 to 0 200 and 0 390 min 1 respectively these results validate that scn activated psf pms can be much enhanced at elevated temperatures 32 furthermore as activation of psf pms is an aqueous solution ph is a critical parameter fig 5 a reveals rhb decolorization by scn activated psf at ph 4 7 and 11 while rhb decolorization at ph 3 remained comparable to that at ph 7 the decolorization extent was negatively affected at ph 11 a similar result was obtained in the case of scn activated pms the decolorization extent considerably decreased at ph 11 whereas that was slightly influenced at ph 4 these results reveal that rhb decolorization by scn activated psf pms was unfavorable under basic conditions possibly because psf and pms tend to decompose without the generation of sulfate radicals under basic conditions 33 35 slowing rhb decolorization on the other hand pms is relatively stable under acidic conditions 35 thereby leading to a slightly lower decolorization as seen in fig 5 b another possibility for the lower decolorization extent obtained by scn activated pms under basic conditions is that the surface charge of scn became even more negative due to the deposition of hydroxyl ions oh the access of so5 to the negatively charged scn was constrained and the transformation from so5 to so4 could be suppressed according to eq 5 36 3 5 effect of nacl on rhb decolorization using scn activated psf pms as wastewater typically contains ions these ions may influence psf pms activation to evaluate effects of ions a model salt nacl was added to rhb solutions for examining its effect fig 5 c reveals that 200 mg l 1 of nacl in rhb solution slightly slowed the rhb decolorization using scn activated psf the adverse effect became even more pronounced when nacl concentration increased to 600 mg l 1 a similar phenomenon was observed in the case of rhb decolorization using scn activated pms fig 5 d these results suggest that the presence of nacl slightly hindered rhb decolorization by scn activated psf pms it has been reported that chloride ions can react with sulfate radicals to result in chlorine radicals via the following equations eqs 7 and 8 36 7 cl so4 cl so4 2 8 cl cl cl2 consequently the addition of nacl might consume a part of sulfate radicals generated from scn activated psf pms thereby slowing the decolorization kinetics nevertheless one should note that the concentration of nacl adopted here is much higher than the rhb concentration i e 10 mg l 1 however scn activated psf pms still remained quite effective to decolorize rhb 3 6 effects of inhibitors on rhb decolorization using scn activated psf pms as sulfate radicals are expected to occur during scn activated psf pms sulfate radicals may react with water to generate hydroxyl radicals oh via the following equation 37 eq 9 9 so4 h2o so4 2 oh h thus it is important to distinguish which radicals contributed to decolorization of rhb to do so a particular radical inhibitor for oh tba was added to rhb solutions fig 6 a indicates that rhb decolorization was noticeably slowed in the presence of tba suggesting that rhb decolorization by scn activated psf involved with oh on the other another radical inhibitor methanol was also examined as methanol is a probe reagent for both so4 and oh 38 the corresponding rhb decolorization was influenced even negatively revealing that so4 also participated in rhb decolorization by scn activated psf these results validate that rhb decolorization can be attributed to both so4 and oh on the other hand the effects of inhibitors on rhb decolorization by scn activated pms can be seen in fig 6 b while tba slowed the decolorization slightly the adverse effect of methanol was relatively pronounced thus the decolorization by scn activated pms was primarily due to so4 and oh to a lesser extent these results reveal that a certain amount of oh derived from scn activated psf pms contributed to rhb decolorization 3 7 reusability of scn for activating psf pms to decolorize rhb as scn is proposed to be a sustainable non metal catalyst for activating psf pms its reusability is also an essential aspect fig 6 c and d display decolorization efficiencies of rhb defined as 1 ct c0 over 6 cycles by using re used scn to activate psf pms while the decolorization extent by scn activated psf was still lower than that by scn activated psf decolorization efficiency remained almost the same over 6 cycles the decolorization efficiency of scn activated pms was also quite stable without significant loss over 6 cycles this demonstrates that scn is a promising and sustainable material which can be re used without regeneration treatments and remains effective for activating psf pms 4 conclusion in this study a sulfur doped carbon nitride scn was prepared via one step heat treatment of trithiocyanuric acid and used for the first time as a non metal catalyst to activate psf pms even without light irradiation the resulting scn exhibited the crumpled morphology and porosity on its surface allowing it to possess a much higher surface area than typical undoped cn as rhb decolorization was selected as a model test to evaluate psf pms activation scn also showed a much higher catalytic activity than cn to activate psf pms for rhb decolorization scn activated pms appeared to be more effective than scn activated psf for rhb decolorization possibly because more sulfate radicals could be generated during activation scn activated psf pms for rhb decolorization was much favorable at elevated temperatures and under neutral conditions the presence of nacl slightly inhibited rhb decolorization as cl might consume some sulfate radicals several radical inhibitors on scn activated psf pms were also evaluated and the rhb mechanism was shown to involve both sulfate and hydroxyl radicals based on the chemical configuration of scn potential mechanisms of pms activation by scn are also proposed and ascribed to the more active carbon sites of scn induced by the co dopant of sulfur and nitrogen scn can be also re used to activate psf pms without significant activity loss these features demonstrate that scn is a conveniently prepared but effective and sustainable non metal heterogeneous catalyst to activate psf pms for

14542,water contains iron fe and manganese mn that can be difficult to remove by singular physico chemical methods this review paper focuses on the potential of biological aerated filter baf technology for the simultaneous removal of fe and mn it also covers the chemical properties of the respective metals the causes and effects of high fe and mn and other removal technologies including conventional and advanced treatment methods surface waters and groundwater aquifers contain concentrations of fe and mn above their permitted limits as regulated by the authorities thus the baf system and its features are believed to have much potential to overcome many of the problems related to fe and mn contamination keywords biological aerated filters drinking water iron and manganese surface water groundwater 1 introduction in developing country such malaysia many water resources are polluted due to a diminished public awareness regarding environmental health which leads to the indiscriminate disposal of waste or the discharge of effluent from industrial activity 1 approximately 7 4 billion people are estimated to live on the earth according to the united nations department of economic and social affairs population division 2 as the world population increases there is an annual decline in the accessibility of clean and safe water despite it being one of the most basic human necessities water is scored as an essential requirement for life second only to oxygen more than half of a body s weight is composed of water and it is important for cell growth use as a body coolant the protection of tissue from shock and damage aiding in the digestion and absorption of food the removal of waste and the maintenance of a healthy weight 3 the world health organization who estimated that approximately 22 of the population does not have good access to drinking water rapid industrialization over the last few decades around the world and in malaysia specifically has caused serious repercussions including the pollution of groundwater and surface water the contamination of iron fe and manganese mn ions in groundwater occurs naturally or by anthropogenic sources including industrial effluent landfill leakage and acid mine drainage well casings pump components pipes and storage tanks can also contribute to fe and mn ions groundwater contamination 4 some particular minerals are useful for human and animal health in small doses such as zinc zn copper cu and fe certain elements such as zn cu mn sulphur s fe and boron b combined with phosphates nitrates urea and potassium are useful in agriculture 5 however above the permitted limits and prescribed quantities the concentration of these chemicals can lead to water pollution fe is one of the most abundant metals in the earth s crust and generally presents together with mn above specific levels fe and mn can pose an unfavourable impact to both the environment and human beings both fe and mn ions are found in surface and groundwaters at fluctuating concentration levels 6 the principal goal of water treatment is to minimize the risks from biological chemical and physical contaminants by reducing them to acceptable levels this includes ensuring that the water is of high aesthetic quality that is the taste odour clearness and colour of the water do not cause offense to consumers this also means guaranteeing that the water s chemical constituents do not cause operational problems in circulation systems 7 for that reason the demand towards cost effective and environmental friendly technologies for water treatment are substantial and include the need to eliminate heavy metals and other organic constituents from the water supply although conventional treatment processes precipitation electro coagulation filtration and sedimentation are highly reliable for the removal of fe and mn ions and are well designed and well tested they present a number of drawbacks in terms of treatment capacity efficiency stability space requirements and the generation of large volumes of sludge thus increasing maintenance and operational costs 8 the use of biological treatment based biofilm technology offers an alternative to the physicochemical treatment approaches over the last twenty years with several advantages generally biological treatment processes rely on the activity of micro organisms for the oxidation of organic and inorganic matter 9 many researchers have reportedly taken the approach of using biological treatments and bacterial decomposition agents for the removal of fe and mn ions from wastewater but not for drinking water treatment according to dhokpande and kaware 10 biological methods provide high efficacy with an efficacy of the removal of heavy metals exceeding 90 this is better than chemical treatment because there is no added chemical composition and it has a lower operation and maintenance cost 11 biological aerated filters bafs have been known to offer advantages in the performance of removing suspended solids reducing the space requirement for treatment and generating less sludge 12 and they are generally easy to construct with the ability to treat high organic loads 13 this review paper focuses on the potential of a baf system for the simultaneous removal of fe and mn ions in drinking water as well as other treatment technologies the review covers baf design flow configuration types of supporting media used the role of effective microbes involved and the advantages and disadvantages of the baf system in removing fe and mn 2 legislation of iron and manganese in drinking water the ministry of health of malaysia has regulated a standard limit for drinking water quality through a drinking water quality surveillance programme 2010 focusing on fe and mn the drinking water guidelines are used as a reference whether water from a particular source is free from fe and mn table 1 lists the maximum limits for standards of discharges of fe and mn in drinking water for many countries in north america asia and europe in malaysia drinking water quality standards are divided into two categories which are for raw water and treated water meanwhile public drinking water standards established by the environmental policy act epa are grouped into two categories which are primary and secondary standards primary standards refer to health considerations that are designed to protect human health and are enforceable while secondary standards are recommended but are not enforceable the latter are based on aesthetic factors such as odour taste and colour which may consequently affect suitability for drinking water use 14 in the united states us fe and mn are classified under secondary maximum contaminant level smcl standards indicating that they are recommended for limitation but are not enforced by either federal or state drinking water acts 14 3 iron and manganese 3 1 chemical properties of iron and manganese fe exists in two forms which are soluble ferrous iron fe ii and insoluble ferric particulate iron fe iii fe in water is generally present in the ferrous state it is a lustrous ductile malleable silver grey metal group viii of the periodic table it is known to have boiling and melting points of 1535 and 2750 c respectively and a specific gravity of 7 87 with a molecular mass of 55 845g mol 15 the most common valence states of fe are 2 3 4 and 6 fe is soluble in cold water hot water and diethyl ether 16 the presence of fe ions in natural water may be attributed to the dissolution of rocks and minerals acid mine drainage landfill leachate sewage or engineering industrial effluent mn is a pinkish grey and chemically active element it is known to have boiling and melting points of 2095 and 1244 c respectively and a specific gravity of 7 44 with a molecular mass of 54 94g mol 17 it is a hard and very brittle metal that is hard to melt but is easily oxidized mn is soluble in both hot and cold water it is reactive when pure and as a powder it will burn in oxygen it also reacts with water and dissolves in dilute acids 18 it is non corrosive in the presence of glass the most common oxidation states of mn are 2 3 4 6 and 7 although all possible oxidation states from 3 to 7 have been observed bi valent manganese mn2 compounds are usually soluble in water while manganese with high valence states are generally not soluble in water 19 the most stable oxidation state for manganese is 2 which presents with a pale pink colour such as manganese ii sulphate mnso4 and manganese ii chloride mncl2 20 3 2 case study of iron and manganese contamination most of the general sources of fe and mn ions in water resources are produced from industrial wastewater including sources from mining pesticides organic chemicals rubber and plastics lumber and wood products metal processing tanneries and pharmaceuticals 21 however the major river pollutants are from domestic sewage waste from livestock and farms runoffs from farms and towns silt from earthworks leachate from rubbish dumps litter from riverside squatters and mining waste 1 since groundwater moves through rocks and subsurface soil it has numerous opportunities to dissolve substances as it disseminates through the subsurface 22 in a natural aquifer system water percolating through soil and rocks can dissolve minerals containing fe and mn and store them in solution 22 when exposed to air groundwater containing dissolved fe and mn becomes insoluble and the remaining water is left with a brown red colour that is problematic for consumption 23 the presence of fe ions in groundwater is generally attributed to the dissolution of fe bearing rocks and minerals which are primarily oxides hematite magnetite and limonite sulphides carbonates and silicates under anaerobic conditions in the presence of reducing agents such as organic matter and hydrogen sulphide 24 mn is used principally in the manufacture of iron and steel alloys as an oxidant for cleaning bleaching and disinfection as potassium permanganate and as an ingredient in various products fe and mn are present in water in combination with carbonates sulphates humic compounds chlorides and sometimes phosphates the reaction of mn and fe with air will form dark precipitates following which water will become dull and darkly coloured 24 fig 1 illustrates some of the point sources that contribute to contamination with fe and mn ions the concentration of fe ions is 0 023 0 035 0 14 and 0 08 mg l while the concentration of mn ions is 0 068 0 199 0 01 and 0 06 mg l as recorded respectively in the effluent of textile and dyeing pulp and paper mill and fertilizer industrial wastewater 25 27 gurgel et al 28 discovered that river water in northeastern brazil contained concentrations of 0 780 mg l fe and 0 041 mg l mn nairobi river water in kenya was reported to contain fe and mn ions concentrations of up to 19 22 mg l and 4 32 mg l respectively 29 another investigation published by bacquart et al 30 revealed that surface water in myanmar contains fe and mn ions quantities of 0 94 mg l and 0 342 mg l respectively nitzsche et al 31 conveyed that the concentrations of fe and mn ions in the groundwater were 16 3 and 1 19 mg l respectively in addition the raw water at the songbei water treatment plant wtp which is derived from underground water from an overburdened aquifer was described as having fe and mn ions concentrations of approximately 15 and 1 2 mg l respectively 32 since both metals are abundant in the earth s crust it may readily affect the production and supply of clean drinkable groundwater for drinking water purposes 3 3 effects of high iron and manganese concentrations toxicity resulting from heavy metals relies on several factors including the dose route of exposure chemical species age gender genetics and status of nutrition of exposed individuals 33 fe is an important mineral for the human body but an overdose can result in severe health problems such as anorexia diarrhoea diphasic shock metabolic acidosis vascular congestion of the gastrointestinal tract brain spleen and thymus and death 34 35 other reports suggest that there is no health consequence of fe in drinking water insomuch that the consumption of 0 4 1 mg fe kg of body weight per day does not cause an adverse effect in a healthy person 36 conversely mn has been discovered to affect the central nervous system 37 mn substances can also cause lung liver and vascular disturbances including a decline in blood pressure and brain damage 38 when mn uptake occurs through the skin it can cause tremors and coordination failure 39 sharma et al 40 reported that when fe and mn ions are present in a water supply at concentrations exceeding the permitted limits of 0 2 and 0 05 mg l respectively they are harmful due to their precipitation and when exposed to air they create an unpalatable metallic taste fe and mn precipitates have also been proven to reduce the pipe diameter and eventually clog the pipe before disturbing the distribution supply system to consumers similarly gage et al 6 stated that although they are essential elements for the human diet and pose no health consequences both fe and mn remain problematic from an aesthetic technical and economic point of view adverse effects of higher fe and mn ions concentrations in drinking water can be summarized according to the presence of oxygen even at low levels fe and mn ions can be oxidized to higher valence states in a water distribution system which results in the formation of hydroxide in suspension and causes an undesirable turbidity and colour of the water in addition laundry and sanitary ware will become stained 41 at high levels of fe up to 0 3 mg l ultimately either metal passing into the distribution system may possibly stimulate the growth of microorganisms and the development of certain species of chlorine tolerant microorganisms in the water distribution system 42 6 thus increasing the cost of the disinfection process 43 moreover the growth of fe and mn bacteria due to the presence of these contaminants in the water supply system leads to a foul odour in addition fe is slightly hazardous in the case of skin contact eye contact ingestion or inhalation 16 most countries have set a permissible level of fe and mn ions in the ranges of 0 2 0 3 mg l and 0 04 0 1 mg l respectively 44 50 an undesirable taste is not usually obvious at fe concentrations below 0 3 mg l although turbid and coloured waters may be detectable in piped systems at levels ranging from 0 05 0 1 mg l 4 technology for the removal of iron and manganese from drinking water 4 1 drinking water treatment processes a water treatment plant wtp must be able to treat raw water to levels below the maximum concentration limits there are two major types of treatments addressing the production of safe drinking water conventional and advanced water treatments technologically speaking conventional treatment systems mainly comprise screening coagulation flocculation sedimentation filtration disinfection and fluoridation before storing the final treated water and distributing it to consumers a conventional wtp performs well for low level organic and inorganic contaminants but in some cases of higher levels of organic and non organic substances conventional water treatment is less efficient 51 advanced treatment technologies have been developed in order to amend the treatment process while maintaining the theory of a conventional system examples of such an advanced technology have been presented by hitachi plant technologies ltd 52 including a powdered activated carbon system biological oxidation treatment system ozone treatment system and granular activated carbon system with the continuing need to increase water quality with respect to the removal of fe and mn ions one of the more advanced biological treatment systems i e biological aerated filters bafs it is proves more reliable since it provides a more compact treatment plant lower operational costs and smaller space requirements as well as a high removal performance 8 bafs are well known in wastewater treatment plants that prefer secondary and tertiary processes 53 in this review the baf system is suggested as an additional system for the drinking water treatment plants fig 2 illustrates the placement of a baf system as a secondary treatment which occurs after the sedimentation process in order to remove the contamination of nitrogen and heavy metals in the raw water the selection of water treatment technologies is strongly affected by the quality of the source of water surface waters fluctuate in quality and are always subject to microbial organisms heavy metals and organic and inorganic contamination and thus require additional treatment processes groundwater is not highly influenced compared to surface water and may have a relatively high mineral content but it is generally much less affected by pathogenic contamination however both water sources have issues with fe and mn ions contamination fe and mn ions can be removed by chemical or biological treatments however the results may be different due to many factors that affect the treatment itself 4 2 treatment technologies for iron and manganese removal the removal of fe and mn ions from surface water and groundwater can be performed through several physical chemical methods such as ultrafiltration 54 coagulation flocculation 55 56 activated carbon 24 57 biological methods slow sand filters 58 56 59 and rapid sand filters 60 61 62 physicochemical methods require the addition of another secondary chemical compounds into the water in order to increase removal performance it will involve additional operation costs as well as the generation of chemical sludge on the other hand biological methods are green techniques and are less expensive compared to physicochemical methods the advantages and disadvantages of physical chemical and biological methods in removing fe and mn ions are summarized in table 2 4 2 1 ultrafiltration uf ultrafiltration is a type of separation process using membranes with pore sizes ranging from 0 1 to 0 001 μm typically ultrafiltration will remove organic and inorganic polymeric molecules high molecular weight substances and colloidal materials it is a pressure driven purification process in which water and low molecular weight substances permeate a membrane while colloids particles and macromolecules are recollected fig 3 shows a schematic diagram of an experimental apparatus used to remove mn ions using an ultrafiltration method according to kamar et al 63 the primary removal mechanism in ultrafiltration is size exclusion although the electrical charge and surface of the particles or membrane may affect the purification efficiency xia et al 64 were previously conducted an experiment where the ultrafiltration performance is evaluated in terms of flux and the quality of the treated water with the use of polyacrynitrile pan membrane uf technology has many advantages in comparison with conventional processes such as clarification and disinfection 64 however despite these advantages which are shown in table 2 the application of an ultrafiltration membrane for water treatment is still relatively limited the major factor of this limitation is the long term flux decline due to membrane fouling which results in the lowered production of treated water and higher energy consumption for production as well as the necessity of frequent membrane cleaning 65 choo et al 66 investigated the removal of various levels of fe and mn ions in lake water using ultrafiltration along with chlorine dosages with an in line pre chlorination step the experimental results show that by injecting 5 mg l of chlorine a 90 fe ions removal was achieved while mn ions removal exceeded 80 schneider et al 67 conducted experiments on a variety of oxidants using chlorine chlorine dioxide permanganate and hydrogen peroxide prior to membrane filtration following which 99 of mn ions was effectively removed at 0 5 mg l chlorine dioxide dosing with a 20 min reaction time according to leal et al 54 fe ions removal can be attained by using ultrafiltration however the complete system did not appear effective in the removal of dissolved mn except with the addition of oxidants from these studies it seems that pre treatment using chemical oxidants is required prior to the removal of fe and mn ions using ultrafiltration 4 2 2 coagulation flocculation coagulation is a water treatment process that employs the attraction of very small suspended particles to form larger particles it consists of the addition of a floc forming chemical reagent aluminium sulphate to the water to combine with non settling colloidal solids and slow settling suspended solids to produce a rapid settling floc 55 the purpose of adding a coagulant is to neutralize the charge in theory since most particles in water are negatively charged any positive ion cation can be used as a coagulant 68 a schematic diagram of the coagulation flocculation process is shown in fig 4 tzoupanos and zouboulis 69 stated that coagulation can be achieved with the use of appropriate chemicals which are usually aluminium or iron salts coagulation does not remove all of the viruses and bacteria in the water but it is an important primary step in the water treatment process to remove many particles as well as dissolved organic carbon 70 following the first step of coagulation a second process called flocculation is utilized flocculation is a physicochemical process that reassures the aggregation of coagulated colloidal and finely divided suspended matter using physical mixing or chemical coagulants 56 fu wang et al 71 studied the effect of aluminium chloride alcl3 on the removal of mn ions by coagulation they found that mn ions removal can be enhanced by using k2mno4 oxidation and coagulation aids knocke et al 72 found that 63 of the total fe was eliminated during the coagulation of raw river water using aluminium sulphate with a coagulant dose from 40 to 50 mg l a ph between 6 3 and 6 5 and an initial fe concentration from 0 6 to 2 4 mg l meanwhile montiel et al 73 obtained mn ions removal in the range of 25 30 with an initial concentration of 0 5 1 0 mg l using ferric chloride fecl3 in the presence of alginate at a ph between 7 6 and 7 8 zogo et al 74 tested the method of coagulation flocculation preceded by chlorination under the best conditions i e pre chlorination and coagulation at ph 6 5 the removal efficiency of fe and mn ions was 50 95 and 20 45 respectively from these findings it is apparent that mn ions is poorly eliminated it is therefore necessary to find another method that can eliminate both fe and mn ions simultaneously the addition of fecl3 as a coagulant resulted in the significant removal of fe ions that reached up to 54 while the addition of a polymer non ionic polyacrylamide resulted in an 88 fe ions removal 72 albrektiene et al 75 added 10 15 mg l of poly aluminium chloride pac to achieve 99 of fe removal but pac at levels above 15 mg l had diminished the coagulation process for removing the fe 4 2 3 activated carbon the principle of using granular activated carbon gac employs the removal of heavy metals through complexation or by the electrostatic attraction of metal ions to various surface oxygen containing functional groups 76 the choice of carbon as a filter medium for water treatment is becoming increasingly widespread as a result of new evidence acquired through research regarding its high capacity in removing fe and mn 77 jusoh et al 22 reported that the main factors that contribute to the different adsorption capacities of fe and mn ions onto gac are the ionic radius and electronegativity of metal ions wherein fe has a higher adsorption capacity on gac compared to mn siabi 77 conducted an experiment on different masses of gac and found that gac prepared from charcoal was effective for fe and mn ions removal in water this may relate to the adsorbates characteristics in terms of electronegativity ionic radius and the amount of functional groups on the activated carbon surface which interacts with both fe and mn ions 22 however the application of gac in potable water treatment is expensive and requires high costs of regeneration this led to the development of low cost activated carbon for the removal of fe and mn ions as investigated by dalai et al 24 using sugarcane bagasse based activated carbon sbac and rice husk based activated carbon rhac by passing through both filter materials with water containing fe and mn ions a removal of up to 100 of both fe and mn was observed another study by aji et al 57 found that the adsorption of fe ions is faster and preferential onto groundnut shell activated carbon compared with mn ions wherein the maximum sorption efficiencies of fe and mn ions were 90 and 84 respectively according to okoniewska et al 78 the adsorption of fe and mn ions on impregnated activated carbon is a complex process when ammonia is present in the water and the removal depends on the concentrations of these compounds as well as on the ph and filtration speed even though activated carbon demonstrates an efficient simultaneous removal of fe and mn ions the regeneration process and cost due to saturated conditions has led to difficulties and challenges in the application of this technology at a large scale the activated carbon system is commonly used at the household scale to specifically remove fe ions mn ions odours and other micropollutants 4 2 4 slow sand filter ssf slow sand filters ssfs are well known for the ability to remove microorganisms from water 79 81 the formation of schmutzdecke or a colmation layer on the surface of the sand bed as filtration progresses is considered an important process of the purification mechanism of slow sand filters 79 biological activity is enhanced with increasing filter depths since microorganisms and other suspended particles have to travel more through the sand and thus a higher removal efficiency is expected at greater sand depths 56 the grain size of the sand lies between 0 15 and 0 35 mm in diameter in the field of drinking water purification sand is used ubiquitously as filtering material because of its availability relatively low cost and satisfactory removal performance 82 in practice ssf generally do not employ a chemical pre treatment and thus the raw water must be of high quality by using slow sand filtration up to 97 of fe and mn ions can be removed because of the existence of a bacterial biomass or extractable fe and mn that were distributed within the depth of the media 83 astari and iqbal 58 studied the efficiency of sand filters for water treatment using four different sand filter systems wherein the best system sand filter diameter 115 cm sand depth 50 cm height of water 50 cm and flowrate 45 l h could reduce the concentration of fe and mn ions in raw water with a removal efficiency of 91 5 and 92 respectively at concentrations of fe and mn ions of 0 2 45 mg l and 0 1 1 06 mg l respectively the pilot sand filter that employed a 0 2 2 0 mm sand size could remove up to 95 of fe and mn ions 84 demir 59 focused on investigating the applicability of slow sand filters for fe and mn ions removal in small communities and subsequently found that 90 95 removal efficiencies were achieved with very low effluent concentrations 1 2 mg l 4 2 5 rapid sand filter rapid sand filters are usually used after coagulation and flocculation and are primarily utilized to remove turbidity rapid sand filtration works essentially in the same way as ssf but differs with regard to the size of the sand grains that is large sand grains are used in rapid filters while smaller grained sand is used in slow filters rapid sand filters commonly employ sand grains with sizes between 0 6 and 2 0 mm in diameter 61 a high efficiency of mn removal of over 95 has been reported wherein the concentration of mn in the water after filtration was less than 0 05 mg l using sand grains 0 8 1 2 mm in diameter 62 an investigation concerning the removal of fe and mn ions from drinking water was conducted by sodamade and pearse 60 within which they evaluated the removal efficiency of these elements using locally available filter material it showed that the removal efficiency of fe ions varied between 88 8 and 99 8 while that of mn varied between 60 and 99 the highest removal efficiency was achieved at an influent of 10 mg l and 20 mg l for fe and mn respectively 4 2 6 biofiltration any type of filter with attached biomass on the filter media can be defined as a biofilter 82 it can be used as a trickling filter horizontal rock filter gac filter or sand filter 82 the investigation of fe and mn ions removal using biofiltration in europe 85 and other developing countries such as those in south america and india is well documented it has also been practiced in canada and has gained acceptance as a cost effective treatment option for mn ions removal from drinking water sources and a reduction of chemical oxidants that may possibly form unwanted by products 86 however there is very little experience in the application of biofilters for the potable water industry in developing countries of southeast asia including malaysia thompson et al 87 reported that biofilters have an ability to reduce fe and mn ions to acceptable concentrations with removal efficiencies of 99 and 95 respectively a previous bench scale study found that the removal of mn ions exceeding 80 can be obtained using biofilters 20 86 in rural areas biofilters are a suitable and appropriate technology for the removal of fe and mn ions since the process is simple and no chemical addition is required 5 potential application of biological aerated filters for iron and manganese ions removal the baf system is one of the latest advances in biofiltration treatment techniques it is considered to be a future technology as well as the most promising development in biological processes for the treatment of potable water media used for a baf include submerged or floated aerated and fixed film reactors where microorganisms in the form of biofilms are utilized to remove organic and inorganic matters following which suspended solids are filtered out by the media 88 the design of baf system consists of a column or tank as a main reactor the filtering media and a set of aeration backwash and feeding systems fig 5 shows a setup of the baf system bafs are extensively used in european countries such as holland and germany and are advantageous primarily for the simultaneously treatment of fe mn and ammonia in untreated water 89 bafs are operated using a supporting media and are fed water after the primary treatment coagulation flocculation flows into the reactor the supporting media is used as an attachment of the microbial growth in the form of biofilms treated water from the primary treatment can be passed through the baf system either from the top or bottom depending on the design configuration of the water treatment plant air is diffused upward using a compressor or air blower during the operation in order to supply oxygen to the biofilm for growth purposes 88 because the process relies on autotrophic bacterial activity for the oxidation of fe and mn ions 87 furthermore the supply of air also assists with the reaction of fe and mn ions with oxygen to form precipitates to ensure the sustainability of the baf system backwash is necessary when a maximum head loss is increasingly detected such that the system performance can revert back to its original working condition 90 among the currently available biological treatment processes the recent application of the baf system is gradually gaining momentum due to a few advantages the baf system is a flexible reactor and is able to eradicate physical pollutants suspended solids alongside chemical pollutants and thus little space is required for the treatment according to zhang et al 91 a baf system also offers the advantage of high specific volumetric degradation rates over a conventional activated sludge process previous research by fu et al 92 regarding the simultaneous removal of fe and mn ions found that 90 and 99 removal were achieved respectively when using a baf system hasan et al 93 studied the removal of mn ions for high strength and low strength polluted drinking water using a baf system and found removal efficiencies for mn ions of 99 1 and 82 9 for either condition respectively according to yulan et al 94 from the beginning of operation and throughout the entire trial the fe ions removal efficiency was more than 98 using biological aerated filters 5 1 key operation principles of biological aerated filters considering the application of a baf system in water treatment plants for the removal of fe and mn the design requires scrutiny of the parts used for the reactor flow configuration supporting media aeration system and backwash system table 3 summarizes the configuration and dimensions of the baf system a few studies have reported on the design of a baf for the treatment of water at the laboratory scale wherein plexi glass was frequently used as a reactor material the diameter and height of the reactor ranged from 0 1 to 2 m and 0 2 5 1 m respectively as demonstrated in table 3 an up flow configuration was more commonly reported compared with a down flow configuration 5 1 1 supporting media selecting appropriate and suitable supporting media for the baf system is important in the design and operation of the process the best supporting media should be resistant to corrosion and attrition should possess an appropriate specific weight and high specific surface area be chemically dependable 95 durable and easy to manage and should not clog the reactor 8 the media surface acts as housing and as an attachment medium for the biofilm the supporting media are categorized as submerged and floating media as summarized in table 4 submerged media or granular media consist of sand grains zeolite activated carbon and gravel while floating media can be plastics made from polypropylene or polyethylene when using granular media it can be either denser than water to produce sunken media or less dense than water to produce floating media sunken media are commonly used both for down flow or up flow configurations while floating media are only utilized for up flow systems according to wang et al 96 granular media such as gac can occupy more biomass compared to anthracite due to its high specific surface area najm et al 97 proposed that a baf system can be designed to use dual media with a combination of gac or anthracite on the top layer and sand on the bottom layer as reported by ha et al 98 the highest rated performance of a baf system using gravel media was the result of a high specific surface area compared to lava rock and plastic rings 98 on the other hand the use of large supporting media greater than 6 mm reduces the removal of solids due to high void spaces and reduces the area available for biofilm growth and attachment 99 whereas media sizes less than 3 mm enable better filtration and provide a larger surface area for biofilms 100 stembal et al 84 found that small quartz sand grains ranging from 0 5 to 2 0 mm could remove fe and mn ions in three different regions of contaminated groundwater with 80 100 fe removal and 50 95 mn removal the roughness of the media also affects the performance of the baf system rough surface media provides more sites for biofilm attachment than smooth media and has been found to improve the retention of solids 8 thus supporting media selection can be considered an important factor in the design of a baf system in order to ensure sufficient and mature biofilm growth for a high removal efficiency of contaminants as well as fe and mn ions from water 5 1 2 flow configuration of a baf generally up flow configurations operate when influent is introduced at the bottom of the baf concurrent with aeration while down flow configurations operate in a counter current mode with aeration where the influent is introduced at the top of the reactor the up flow baf is widely applied for water treatment but presents some limitations for inorganic removal 101 as seen in table 3 only one researcher has designed a down flow configuration for the removal of ss cod and nh3 n to the best of our knowledge there is no down flow baf system designed for the removal of fe and mn ions 5 1 3 backwash system a backwash system is important in a baf in order to remove excess biomass on the order of approximately 30 102 as well as to maximize the length of the treatment cycle and minimize energy consumption 103 additionally when the head loss or pressure decrease in the filter bed reaches a maximum level the backwashing process phase will initiate 104 furthermore backwashing occurs once flocs begin to break through the filter after which the turbidity in the water filtered effluent increases 37 the frequency of backwashing depends on the size shape density and void porosity of the media in addition to the characteristics of the water to be treated 105 backwash may be performed with solely up flow wash water air scour or with a simultaneous application of air and water wash farabegoli et al 104 postulated that the backwash attained by water alone is often not enough to properly backwash the media it then becomes necessary to apply additional force by bubbling air through the bed which is the so called air scour process however if a baf system has only water available for backwashing a very high backwash rate must be achieved in order to attain the shear forces required for effective media cleaning 104 if air scour is provided then lower backwash rates can be used since the water consequently only serves to flush the dirt from the bed in this case beds are seldom expanded by more than 10 106 thus the simultaneous application of air and water gives and advantage of high cleaning efficiency 107 while producing optimum conditions for removal of deposits from filter grains 108 in terms of economic concern these combination have low water requirement and energy consumption 11 the biomass attached to the filter media must be carefully maintained during backwashing since micro organisms grow during biofilter operation bai et al 109 suggested that low flow rate backwashing performed for a short time can alleviate biofilter clogging and accelerate the start up operation on the other hand biofilters that are not backwashed in the start up operation will become hardened due to clogging from a large amount of biomass and solids along the bottom layer and subsequently it can be difficult to run the filter and perform backwashing 37 backwash rates and frequency are not the same for all biological filters pacini et al 83 concluded that the best combination for the system operated in their study was a filtration rate of 12 m h a backwashing time of 10 min and a backwashing rate of 50 m h katsoyiannis and zouboulis 20 backwashed their biofilter columns every three days which was capable of removing the deposited quantities of fe and mn according to tekerlekopoulou and vayenas 110 backwashing was performed approximately once a week depending on the operating conditions using high water and air up flow velocities and was able to remove the excess amount of biomass and sediment stembal et al 84 applied backwashing processes once every 24 h generally the amount of water required for the backwashing of full scale baf plants was 2 of the total treated water if used for tertiary treatment and 12 35 when used for secondary treatment compared to 0 9 8 3 used in sand and anthracite filters 102 han et al 111 stated that during the long term operation of a baf system backwashing was performed according to the water head loss and turbidity and it was generally conducted once every 7 days in the winter and once every 15 days in the summer another study by hasan et al 11 reported performing a backwash process whenever the baf performance became gradually inefficient for which an average backwash water flow rate was set at 10 l min and adjusted as required through the backwash valve and the air flow rate was fixed at 0 1 l min 11 the effect of backwashing can be explained by ma et al 112 wherein fe and mn outlet concentrations observed 30 min before backwashing were 0 23 mg l and 0 04 mg l respectively which were worse than those of a steady baf operation after backwashing the removal of fe was restored quickly and enhanced by 8 after an hour of operation after which the outlet concentration stabilized baudish 113 operated the filter for approximately three weeks and backwashed every 5 7 days sampling showed that the do levels in the filtered water was above 5 mg l and mn ions was removed from an incoming level of 0 050 mg l to levels generally below the detection limit of 0 005 mg l despite more frequent backwashing biological activity was maintained 5 1 4 aeration supplement an aeration system is a significant parameter in a biological aerated filter baf system wherein the air promotes the growth of biomass in the voids of the media by supplying the required oxygen for the organisms 90 farabegoli et al 104 supplied oxygen via compressed air through four porous stones located at the bottom of the filter bed with an air flow rate of 2 5 l min to maintain an average dissolved oxygen do concentration of more than 3 mg l do strongly influences the performance of a baf system in removing fe and mn ions as it is necessary for microorganisms to grow manganese oxidizing bacteria mnob require more rigorous conditions to oxidize mn ions than those required to oxidize fe ions although fe ions removal can be accomplished at 2 mg l with a do and an initial ph of 7 2 mn ions removal requires a higher do at the same ph 20 a do range of 0 1 mg l and 5 6 mg l o2 were determined as the optimal conditions for iron and manganese oxidizing bacteria respectively 114 under steady operation with a do of 5 mg l the removal of mn ions using a sand filter was reported at 74 3 while fe ions removal was 99 115 according to tekerlekopoulou and vayenas 110 who investigated fe and mn ions removal the do concentration in the liquid phase throughout the trickling filter depth was always between 7 0 and 8 0 mg l lower do levels in a sand filter compared to a trickling filter might be the most efficient selection for the removal of fe and mn ions the oxidation of fe and mn ions will form a precipitate the following reaction shows the oxidation of ferrous iron and manganous manganese by oxygen in eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 4fe hco3 2 o2 2h2o 4fe oh 3 8co2 2 2mn hco3 2 o2 2h2o 2mn oh 4 4co2 one mole of oxygen molecules is needed to react with four moles of fe ions to form four moles of fe precipitate similarly one mole of oxygen molecules is needed to react with two moles of mn ions to form two moles of mn precipitate from these equations it is theoretically confirmed that more oxygen is required for mn ions oxidation compared with that of fe ions 5 2 potential microorganisms as remediating agents in a baf system microorganisms including bacteria yeast and algae are able to remove fe and mn ions whether operating simultaneously or alone table 5 shows the microorganism species responsible for the removal of fe and mn ions overall 82 99 8 removal can be achieved by using those microorganisms microorganisms can be used as a pure or mixed culture in a baf system an analysis of the distribution and genetic diversity of microorganisms by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis dgge indicated that iron oxidizing bacteria iob gallionella leptothrix and mnob leptothrix pseudomonas hyphomicrobium arthrobacter co existed in the biofilm at different filter bed depths and were responsible for the high simultaneous removal of fe and mn ions in the biofilter 116 according to katsoyiannis and zouboulis 20 the oxidation of fe and mn ions were mediated by leptothrix ochracea and gallionella ferruginea with removal efficiencies of up to 97 0 in another study monocultures of leptothrix discophora were the predominant organism in mature mn oxidizing biofilms which can reduce 97 3 of mn 117 in another technique biosorption studies using two yeast species candida tropicalis and issatchenkia orientalis demonstrated the biosorption capacity of fe and mn ions with reductions of 95 5 of mn and 99 8 of fe after 40 days of treatment 118 using a similar technique but different microorganisms hasan et al 51 found that mn uptake by the bacteria species only reached 13 31 mg mn mg biomass 26 removal within a day their uptake may have increased if the time was prolonged high removal efficiencies of both fe and mn ions can be observed using a biosorption method but the method requires longer time and generates more sludge compared to the biofilm method using a baf system a green algae and microbial mat consortium may be a cost effective treatment technique for permanently removing fe and mn ions from mine drainage 119 at 1 m from the influent pipe in an algae mat pond approximately 2 67 mg mn and 34 25 mg fe were deposited in a gram of dried mat 119 schenck et al 120 conducted an experiment using green alga chlamydomonas variabilis as a function of ph to remove fe and mn ions in buffered synthetic solutions over the ph range from 5 to 7 the adsorption of fe and mn ions onto the algae surface was independent relative to ph whereas increased ph had increased the uptake of fe and mn 120 6 possible challenges of iron and manganese removal using baf systems smaller towns communities and individual users in rural areas often rely on local water resources in rural communities the respective removal methods developed for large scale water treatment plants are not easily applicable because of high operational and capital costs or they are simply too complicated and their use is sometimes limited by the specific water composition consequently small drinking water systems face tougher challenges in providing a safe and sufficient supply of drinking water at a reasonable cost 121 attempts have been made to resolve the problem in some areas by installing low cost fe removal units promoted by unicef 122 since 1986 however they are very few in number and the majority of the units do not work properly or are not being used as a result of various operational problems 24 the conventional methods used for the removal of high concentrations of fe and mn ions include chemical dosing or advanced oxidation processes requiring sophisticated process control and operator skills which are a challenge in rural areas 87 moreover redox is the key parameter which determines the sequence of the oxidation of these pollutants wherein fe ions is oxidized at low redox values 200 mv and mn ions needs even higher redox values 400 mv at neutral ph 123 thus the simultaneous removal of these pollutants when present in a water deposit requires several step by step processes or spatial redox variation several problems are associated with the physical chemical treatment for fe and mn ions removal as observed in france 20 years ago whereupon the sources of poorly functioning wtps were due to fe complexion interference by nitrification short oxidation time and low oxidation ph and deterioration of the raw water quality 123 challenges in the treatment of fe and mn ions are also related to the production of metal oxides which can clog pipes and discolour clothes 124 moreover additional potential challenges to be faced in the biological treatment of fe and mn ions in drinking water is to control the non pathogenic microbe introduced along with the treatment 7 future study from this review the treatment of fe and mn ions using an up flow baf system is considered as an alternative to the conventional treatment for safe and clean drinking water production future studies will be focused on the removal of fe and mn ions using non pathogenic microbes that are isolated from the local environment in addition to the treatment three optimal parameters will be varied including the concentration of fe and mn ions empty bed contact time ebct and aeration in order to determine the effectiveness of baf associated biofilm communities on the removal of fe and mn ions the community of non pathogenic microbes will be monitored throughout the study in order to prevent microbial contamination of the treated water this is the main challenge in this study whereby it will be given a high priority in our investigation 8 conclusion in conclusion fe and mn ions can be removed from drinking water either by physicochemical or biological treatments due to some limitations and in order to achieve a good quality of water for drinking purposes biological treatments as well as baf systems are preferable over the implementation of chemical treatments the key factor in the removal of fe and mn ions using a baf system is the design including the aeration and backwash system supporting media and the presence of microorganisms that oxidize fe and mn ions with the advantages of the baf system it would be a potential system for the removal of fe and mn ions in the treatment of drinking water acknowledgements this research was financially supported by the universiti kebangsaan malaysia through grant

14542,water contains iron fe and manganese mn that can be difficult to remove by singular physico chemical methods this review paper focuses on the potential of biological aerated filter baf technology for the simultaneous removal of fe and mn it also covers the chemical properties of the respective metals the causes and effects of high fe and mn and other removal technologies including conventional and advanced treatment methods surface waters and groundwater aquifers contain concentrations of fe and mn above their permitted limits as regulated by the authorities thus the baf system and its features are believed to have much potential to overcome many of the problems related to fe and mn contamination keywords biological aerated filters drinking water iron and manganese surface water groundwater 1 introduction in developing country such malaysia many water resources are polluted due to a diminished public awareness regarding environmental health which leads to the indiscriminate disposal of waste or the discharge of effluent from industrial activity 1 approximately 7 4 billion people are estimated to live on the earth according to the united nations department of economic and social affairs population division 2 as the world population increases there is an annual decline in the accessibility of clean and safe water despite it being one of the most basic human necessities water is scored as an essential requirement for life second only to oxygen more than half of a body s weight is composed of water and it is important for cell growth use as a body coolant the protection of tissue from shock and damage aiding in the digestion and absorption of food the removal of waste and the maintenance of a healthy weight 3 the world health organization who estimated that approximately 22 of the population does not have good access to drinking water rapid industrialization over the last few decades around the world and in malaysia specifically has caused serious repercussions including the pollution of groundwater and surface water the contamination of iron fe and manganese mn ions in groundwater occurs naturally or by anthropogenic sources including industrial effluent landfill leakage and acid mine drainage well casings pump components pipes and storage tanks can also contribute to fe and mn ions groundwater contamination 4 some particular minerals are useful for human and animal health in small doses such as zinc zn copper cu and fe certain elements such as zn cu mn sulphur s fe and boron b combined with phosphates nitrates urea and potassium are useful in agriculture 5 however above the permitted limits and prescribed quantities the concentration of these chemicals can lead to water pollution fe is one of the most abundant metals in the earth s crust and generally presents together with mn above specific levels fe and mn can pose an unfavourable impact to both the environment and human beings both fe and mn ions are found in surface and groundwaters at fluctuating concentration levels 6 the principal goal of water treatment is to minimize the risks from biological chemical and physical contaminants by reducing them to acceptable levels this includes ensuring that the water is of high aesthetic quality that is the taste odour clearness and colour of the water do not cause offense to consumers this also means guaranteeing that the water s chemical constituents do not cause operational problems in circulation systems 7 for that reason the demand towards cost effective and environmental friendly technologies for water treatment are substantial and include the need to eliminate heavy metals and other organic constituents from the water supply although conventional treatment processes precipitation electro coagulation filtration and sedimentation are highly reliable for the removal of fe and mn ions and are well designed and well tested they present a number of drawbacks in terms of treatment capacity efficiency stability space requirements and the generation of large volumes of sludge thus increasing maintenance and operational costs 8 the use of biological treatment based biofilm technology offers an alternative to the physicochemical treatment approaches over the last twenty years with several advantages generally biological treatment processes rely on the activity of micro organisms for the oxidation of organic and inorganic matter 9 many researchers have reportedly taken the approach of using biological treatments and bacterial decomposition agents for the removal of fe and mn ions from wastewater but not for drinking water treatment according to dhokpande and kaware 10 biological methods provide high efficacy with an efficacy of the removal of heavy metals exceeding 90 this is better than chemical treatment because there is no added chemical composition and it has a lower operation and maintenance cost 11 biological aerated filters bafs have been known to offer advantages in the performance of removing suspended solids reducing the space requirement for treatment and generating less sludge 12 and they are generally easy to construct with the ability to treat high organic loads 13 this review paper focuses on the potential of a baf system for the simultaneous removal of fe and mn ions in drinking water as well as other treatment technologies the review covers baf design flow configuration types of supporting media used the role of effective microbes involved and the advantages and disadvantages of the baf system in removing fe and mn 2 legislation of iron and manganese in drinking water the ministry of health of malaysia has regulated a standard limit for drinking water quality through a drinking water quality surveillance programme 2010 focusing on fe and mn the drinking water guidelines are used as a reference whether water from a particular source is free from fe and mn table 1 lists the maximum limits for standards of discharges of fe and mn in drinking water for many countries in north america asia and europe in malaysia drinking water quality standards are divided into two categories which are for raw water and treated water meanwhile public drinking water standards established by the environmental policy act epa are grouped into two categories which are primary and secondary standards primary standards refer to health considerations that are designed to protect human health and are enforceable while secondary standards are recommended but are not enforceable the latter are based on aesthetic factors such as odour taste and colour which may consequently affect suitability for drinking water use 14 in the united states us fe and mn are classified under secondary maximum contaminant level smcl standards indicating that they are recommended for limitation but are not enforced by either federal or state drinking water acts 14 3 iron and manganese 3 1 chemical properties of iron and manganese fe exists in two forms which are soluble ferrous iron fe ii and insoluble ferric particulate iron fe iii fe in water is generally present in the ferrous state it is a lustrous ductile malleable silver grey metal group viii of the periodic table it is known to have boiling and melting points of 1535 and 2750 c respectively and a specific gravity of 7 87 with a molecular mass of 55 845g mol 15 the most common valence states of fe are 2 3 4 and 6 fe is soluble in cold water hot water and diethyl ether 16 the presence of fe ions in natural water may be attributed to the dissolution of rocks and minerals acid mine drainage landfill leachate sewage or engineering industrial effluent mn is a pinkish grey and chemically active element it is known to have boiling and melting points of 2095 and 1244 c respectively and a specific gravity of 7 44 with a molecular mass of 54 94g mol 17 it is a hard and very brittle metal that is hard to melt but is easily oxidized mn is soluble in both hot and cold water it is reactive when pure and as a powder it will burn in oxygen it also reacts with water and dissolves in dilute acids 18 it is non corrosive in the presence of glass the most common oxidation states of mn are 2 3 4 6 and 7 although all possible oxidation states from 3 to 7 have been observed bi valent manganese mn2 compounds are usually soluble in water while manganese with high valence states are generally not soluble in water 19 the most stable oxidation state for manganese is 2 which presents with a pale pink colour such as manganese ii sulphate mnso4 and manganese ii chloride mncl2 20 3 2 case study of iron and manganese contamination most of the general sources of fe and mn ions in water resources are produced from industrial wastewater including sources from mining pesticides organic chemicals rubber and plastics lumber and wood products metal processing tanneries and pharmaceuticals 21 however the major river pollutants are from domestic sewage waste from livestock and farms runoffs from farms and towns silt from earthworks leachate from rubbish dumps litter from riverside squatters and mining waste 1 since groundwater moves through rocks and subsurface soil it has numerous opportunities to dissolve substances as it disseminates through the subsurface 22 in a natural aquifer system water percolating through soil and rocks can dissolve minerals containing fe and mn and store them in solution 22 when exposed to air groundwater containing dissolved fe and mn becomes insoluble and the remaining water is left with a brown red colour that is problematic for consumption 23 the presence of fe ions in groundwater is generally attributed to the dissolution of fe bearing rocks and minerals which are primarily oxides hematite magnetite and limonite sulphides carbonates and silicates under anaerobic conditions in the presence of reducing agents such as organic matter and hydrogen sulphide 24 mn is used principally in the manufacture of iron and steel alloys as an oxidant for cleaning bleaching and disinfection as potassium permanganate and as an ingredient in various products fe and mn are present in water in combination with carbonates sulphates humic compounds chlorides and sometimes phosphates the reaction of mn and fe with air will form dark precipitates following which water will become dull and darkly coloured 24 fig 1 illustrates some of the point sources that contribute to contamination with fe and mn ions the concentration of fe ions is 0 023 0 035 0 14 and 0 08 mg l while the concentration of mn ions is 0 068 0 199 0 01 and 0 06 mg l as recorded respectively in the effluent of textile and dyeing pulp and paper mill and fertilizer industrial wastewater 25 27 gurgel et al 28 discovered that river water in northeastern brazil contained concentrations of 0 780 mg l fe and 0 041 mg l mn nairobi river water in kenya was reported to contain fe and mn ions concentrations of up to 19 22 mg l and 4 32 mg l respectively 29 another investigation published by bacquart et al 30 revealed that surface water in myanmar contains fe and mn ions quantities of 0 94 mg l and 0 342 mg l respectively nitzsche et al 31 conveyed that the concentrations of fe and mn ions in the groundwater were 16 3 and 1 19 mg l respectively in addition the raw water at the songbei water treatment plant wtp which is derived from underground water from an overburdened aquifer was described as having fe and mn ions concentrations of approximately 15 and 1 2 mg l respectively 32 since both metals are abundant in the earth s crust it may readily affect the production and supply of clean drinkable groundwater for drinking water purposes 3 3 effects of high iron and manganese concentrations toxicity resulting from heavy metals relies on several factors including the dose route of exposure chemical species age gender genetics and status of nutrition of exposed individuals 33 fe is an important mineral for the human body but an overdose can result in severe health problems such as anorexia diarrhoea diphasic shock metabolic acidosis vascular congestion of the gastrointestinal tract brain spleen and thymus and death 34 35 other reports suggest that there is no health consequence of fe in drinking water insomuch that the consumption of 0 4 1 mg fe kg of body weight per day does not cause an adverse effect in a healthy person 36 conversely mn has been discovered to affect the central nervous system 37 mn substances can also cause lung liver and vascular disturbances including a decline in blood pressure and brain damage 38 when mn uptake occurs through the skin it can cause tremors and coordination failure 39 sharma et al 40 reported that when fe and mn ions are present in a water supply at concentrations exceeding the permitted limits of 0 2 and 0 05 mg l respectively they are harmful due to their precipitation and when exposed to air they create an unpalatable metallic taste fe and mn precipitates have also been proven to reduce the pipe diameter and eventually clog the pipe before disturbing the distribution supply system to consumers similarly gage et al 6 stated that although they are essential elements for the human diet and pose no health consequences both fe and mn remain problematic from an aesthetic technical and economic point of view adverse effects of higher fe and mn ions concentrations in drinking water can be summarized according to the presence of oxygen even at low levels fe and mn ions can be oxidized to higher valence states in a water distribution system which results in the formation of hydroxide in suspension and causes an undesirable turbidity and colour of the water in addition laundry and sanitary ware will become stained 41 at high levels of fe up to 0 3 mg l ultimately either metal passing into the distribution system may possibly stimulate the growth of microorganisms and the development of certain species of chlorine tolerant microorganisms in the water distribution system 42 6 thus increasing the cost of the disinfection process 43 moreover the growth of fe and mn bacteria due to the presence of these contaminants in the water supply system leads to a foul odour in addition fe is slightly hazardous in the case of skin contact eye contact ingestion or inhalation 16 most countries have set a permissible level of fe and mn ions in the ranges of 0 2 0 3 mg l and 0 04 0 1 mg l respectively 44 50 an undesirable taste is not usually obvious at fe concentrations below 0 3 mg l although turbid and coloured waters may be detectable in piped systems at levels ranging from 0 05 0 1 mg l 4 technology for the removal of iron and manganese from drinking water 4 1 drinking water treatment processes a water treatment plant wtp must be able to treat raw water to levels below the maximum concentration limits there are two major types of treatments addressing the production of safe drinking water conventional and advanced water treatments technologically speaking conventional treatment systems mainly comprise screening coagulation flocculation sedimentation filtration disinfection and fluoridation before storing the final treated water and distributing it to consumers a conventional wtp performs well for low level organic and inorganic contaminants but in some cases of higher levels of organic and non organic substances conventional water treatment is less efficient 51 advanced treatment technologies have been developed in order to amend the treatment process while maintaining the theory of a conventional system examples of such an advanced technology have been presented by hitachi plant technologies ltd 52 including a powdered activated carbon system biological oxidation treatment system ozone treatment system and granular activated carbon system with the continuing need to increase water quality with respect to the removal of fe and mn ions one of the more advanced biological treatment systems i e biological aerated filters bafs it is proves more reliable since it provides a more compact treatment plant lower operational costs and smaller space requirements as well as a high removal performance 8 bafs are well known in wastewater treatment plants that prefer secondary and tertiary processes 53 in this review the baf system is suggested as an additional system for the drinking water treatment plants fig 2 illustrates the placement of a baf system as a secondary treatment which occurs after the sedimentation process in order to remove the contamination of nitrogen and heavy metals in the raw water the selection of water treatment technologies is strongly affected by the quality of the source of water surface waters fluctuate in quality and are always subject to microbial organisms heavy metals and organic and inorganic contamination and thus require additional treatment processes groundwater is not highly influenced compared to surface water and may have a relatively high mineral content but it is generally much less affected by pathogenic contamination however both water sources have issues with fe and mn ions contamination fe and mn ions can be removed by chemical or biological treatments however the results may be different due to many factors that affect the treatment itself 4 2 treatment technologies for iron and manganese removal the removal of fe and mn ions from surface water and groundwater can be performed through several physical chemical methods such as ultrafiltration 54 coagulation flocculation 55 56 activated carbon 24 57 biological methods slow sand filters 58 56 59 and rapid sand filters 60 61 62 physicochemical methods require the addition of another secondary chemical compounds into the water in order to increase removal performance it will involve additional operation costs as well as the generation of chemical sludge on the other hand biological methods are green techniques and are less expensive compared to physicochemical methods the advantages and disadvantages of physical chemical and biological methods in removing fe and mn ions are summarized in table 2 4 2 1 ultrafiltration uf ultrafiltration is a type of separation process using membranes with pore sizes ranging from 0 1 to 0 001 μm typically ultrafiltration will remove organic and inorganic polymeric molecules high molecular weight substances and colloidal materials it is a pressure driven purification process in which water and low molecular weight substances permeate a membrane while colloids particles and macromolecules are recollected fig 3 shows a schematic diagram of an experimental apparatus used to remove mn ions using an ultrafiltration method according to kamar et al 63 the primary removal mechanism in ultrafiltration is size exclusion although the electrical charge and surface of the particles or membrane may affect the purification efficiency xia et al 64 were previously conducted an experiment where the ultrafiltration performance is evaluated in terms of flux and the quality of the treated water with the use of polyacrynitrile pan membrane uf technology has many advantages in comparison with conventional processes such as clarification and disinfection 64 however despite these advantages which are shown in table 2 the application of an ultrafiltration membrane for water treatment is still relatively limited the major factor of this limitation is the long term flux decline due to membrane fouling which results in the lowered production of treated water and higher energy consumption for production as well as the necessity of frequent membrane cleaning 65 choo et al 66 investigated the removal of various levels of fe and mn ions in lake water using ultrafiltration along with chlorine dosages with an in line pre chlorination step the experimental results show that by injecting 5 mg l of chlorine a 90 fe ions removal was achieved while mn ions removal exceeded 80 schneider et al 67 conducted experiments on a variety of oxidants using chlorine chlorine dioxide permanganate and hydrogen peroxide prior to membrane filtration following which 99 of mn ions was effectively removed at 0 5 mg l chlorine dioxide dosing with a 20 min reaction time according to leal et al 54 fe ions removal can be attained by using ultrafiltration however the complete system did not appear effective in the removal of dissolved mn except with the addition of oxidants from these studies it seems that pre treatment using chemical oxidants is required prior to the removal of fe and mn ions using ultrafiltration 4 2 2 coagulation flocculation coagulation is a water treatment process that employs the attraction of very small suspended particles to form larger particles it consists of the addition of a floc forming chemical reagent aluminium sulphate to the water to combine with non settling colloidal solids and slow settling suspended solids to produce a rapid settling floc 55 the purpose of adding a coagulant is to neutralize the charge in theory since most particles in water are negatively charged any positive ion cation can be used as a coagulant 68 a schematic diagram of the coagulation flocculation process is shown in fig 4 tzoupanos and zouboulis 69 stated that coagulation can be achieved with the use of appropriate chemicals which are usually aluminium or iron salts coagulation does not remove all of the viruses and bacteria in the water but it is an important primary step in the water treatment process to remove many particles as well as dissolved organic carbon 70 following the first step of coagulation a second process called flocculation is utilized flocculation is a physicochemical process that reassures the aggregation of coagulated colloidal and finely divided suspended matter using physical mixing or chemical coagulants 56 fu wang et al 71 studied the effect of aluminium chloride alcl3 on the removal of mn ions by coagulation they found that mn ions removal can be enhanced by using k2mno4 oxidation and coagulation aids knocke et al 72 found that 63 of the total fe was eliminated during the coagulation of raw river water using aluminium sulphate with a coagulant dose from 40 to 50 mg l a ph between 6 3 and 6 5 and an initial fe concentration from 0 6 to 2 4 mg l meanwhile montiel et al 73 obtained mn ions removal in the range of 25 30 with an initial concentration of 0 5 1 0 mg l using ferric chloride fecl3 in the presence of alginate at a ph between 7 6 and 7 8 zogo et al 74 tested the method of coagulation flocculation preceded by chlorination under the best conditions i e pre chlorination and coagulation at ph 6 5 the removal efficiency of fe and mn ions was 50 95 and 20 45 respectively from these findings it is apparent that mn ions is poorly eliminated it is therefore necessary to find another method that can eliminate both fe and mn ions simultaneously the addition of fecl3 as a coagulant resulted in the significant removal of fe ions that reached up to 54 while the addition of a polymer non ionic polyacrylamide resulted in an 88 fe ions removal 72 albrektiene et al 75 added 10 15 mg l of poly aluminium chloride pac to achieve 99 of fe removal but pac at levels above 15 mg l had diminished the coagulation process for removing the fe 4 2 3 activated carbon the principle of using granular activated carbon gac employs the removal of heavy metals through complexation or by the electrostatic attraction of metal ions to various surface oxygen containing functional groups 76 the choice of carbon as a filter medium for water treatment is becoming increasingly widespread as a result of new evidence acquired through research regarding its high capacity in removing fe and mn 77 jusoh et al 22 reported that the main factors that contribute to the different adsorption capacities of fe and mn ions onto gac are the ionic radius and electronegativity of metal ions wherein fe has a higher adsorption capacity on gac compared to mn siabi 77 conducted an experiment on different masses of gac and found that gac prepared from charcoal was effective for fe and mn ions removal in water this may relate to the adsorbates characteristics in terms of electronegativity ionic radius and the amount of functional groups on the activated carbon surface which interacts with both fe and mn ions 22 however the application of gac in potable water treatment is expensive and requires high costs of regeneration this led to the development of low cost activated carbon for the removal of fe and mn ions as investigated by dalai et al 24 using sugarcane bagasse based activated carbon sbac and rice husk based activated carbon rhac by passing through both filter materials with water containing fe and mn ions a removal of up to 100 of both fe and mn was observed another study by aji et al 57 found that the adsorption of fe ions is faster and preferential onto groundnut shell activated carbon compared with mn ions wherein the maximum sorption efficiencies of fe and mn ions were 90 and 84 respectively according to okoniewska et al 78 the adsorption of fe and mn ions on impregnated activated carbon is a complex process when ammonia is present in the water and the removal depends on the concentrations of these compounds as well as on the ph and filtration speed even though activated carbon demonstrates an efficient simultaneous removal of fe and mn ions the regeneration process and cost due to saturated conditions has led to difficulties and challenges in the application of this technology at a large scale the activated carbon system is commonly used at the household scale to specifically remove fe ions mn ions odours and other micropollutants 4 2 4 slow sand filter ssf slow sand filters ssfs are well known for the ability to remove microorganisms from water 79 81 the formation of schmutzdecke or a colmation layer on the surface of the sand bed as filtration progresses is considered an important process of the purification mechanism of slow sand filters 79 biological activity is enhanced with increasing filter depths since microorganisms and other suspended particles have to travel more through the sand and thus a higher removal efficiency is expected at greater sand depths 56 the grain size of the sand lies between 0 15 and 0 35 mm in diameter in the field of drinking water purification sand is used ubiquitously as filtering material because of its availability relatively low cost and satisfactory removal performance 82 in practice ssf generally do not employ a chemical pre treatment and thus the raw water must be of high quality by using slow sand filtration up to 97 of fe and mn ions can be removed because of the existence of a bacterial biomass or extractable fe and mn that were distributed within the depth of the media 83 astari and iqbal 58 studied the efficiency of sand filters for water treatment using four different sand filter systems wherein the best system sand filter diameter 115 cm sand depth 50 cm height of water 50 cm and flowrate 45 l h could reduce the concentration of fe and mn ions in raw water with a removal efficiency of 91 5 and 92 respectively at concentrations of fe and mn ions of 0 2 45 mg l and 0 1 1 06 mg l respectively the pilot sand filter that employed a 0 2 2 0 mm sand size could remove up to 95 of fe and mn ions 84 demir 59 focused on investigating the applicability of slow sand filters for fe and mn ions removal in small communities and subsequently found that 90 95 removal efficiencies were achieved with very low effluent concentrations 1 2 mg l 4 2 5 rapid sand filter rapid sand filters are usually used after coagulation and flocculation and are primarily utilized to remove turbidity rapid sand filtration works essentially in the same way as ssf but differs with regard to the size of the sand grains that is large sand grains are used in rapid filters while smaller grained sand is used in slow filters rapid sand filters commonly employ sand grains with sizes between 0 6 and 2 0 mm in diameter 61 a high efficiency of mn removal of over 95 has been reported wherein the concentration of mn in the water after filtration was less than 0 05 mg l using sand grains 0 8 1 2 mm in diameter 62 an investigation concerning the removal of fe and mn ions from drinking water was conducted by sodamade and pearse 60 within which they evaluated the removal efficiency of these elements using locally available filter material it showed that the removal efficiency of fe ions varied between 88 8 and 99 8 while that of mn varied between 60 and 99 the highest removal efficiency was achieved at an influent of 10 mg l and 20 mg l for fe and mn respectively 4 2 6 biofiltration any type of filter with attached biomass on the filter media can be defined as a biofilter 82 it can be used as a trickling filter horizontal rock filter gac filter or sand filter 82 the investigation of fe and mn ions removal using biofiltration in europe 85 and other developing countries such as those in south america and india is well documented it has also been practiced in canada and has gained acceptance as a cost effective treatment option for mn ions removal from drinking water sources and a reduction of chemical oxidants that may possibly form unwanted by products 86 however there is very little experience in the application of biofilters for the potable water industry in developing countries of southeast asia including malaysia thompson et al 87 reported that biofilters have an ability to reduce fe and mn ions to acceptable concentrations with removal efficiencies of 99 and 95 respectively a previous bench scale study found that the removal of mn ions exceeding 80 can be obtained using biofilters 20 86 in rural areas biofilters are a suitable and appropriate technology for the removal of fe and mn ions since the process is simple and no chemical addition is required 5 potential application of biological aerated filters for iron and manganese ions removal the baf system is one of the latest advances in biofiltration treatment techniques it is considered to be a future technology as well as the most promising development in biological processes for the treatment of potable water media used for a baf include submerged or floated aerated and fixed film reactors where microorganisms in the form of biofilms are utilized to remove organic and inorganic matters following which suspended solids are filtered out by the media 88 the design of baf system consists of a column or tank as a main reactor the filtering media and a set of aeration backwash and feeding systems fig 5 shows a setup of the baf system bafs are extensively used in european countries such as holland and germany and are advantageous primarily for the simultaneously treatment of fe mn and ammonia in untreated water 89 bafs are operated using a supporting media and are fed water after the primary treatment coagulation flocculation flows into the reactor the supporting media is used as an attachment of the microbial growth in the form of biofilms treated water from the primary treatment can be passed through the baf system either from the top or bottom depending on the design configuration of the water treatment plant air is diffused upward using a compressor or air blower during the operation in order to supply oxygen to the biofilm for growth purposes 88 because the process relies on autotrophic bacterial activity for the oxidation of fe and mn ions 87 furthermore the supply of air also assists with the reaction of fe and mn ions with oxygen to form precipitates to ensure the sustainability of the baf system backwash is necessary when a maximum head loss is increasingly detected such that the system performance can revert back to its original working condition 90 among the currently available biological treatment processes the recent application of the baf system is gradually gaining momentum due to a few advantages the baf system is a flexible reactor and is able to eradicate physical pollutants suspended solids alongside chemical pollutants and thus little space is required for the treatment according to zhang et al 91 a baf system also offers the advantage of high specific volumetric degradation rates over a conventional activated sludge process previous research by fu et al 92 regarding the simultaneous removal of fe and mn ions found that 90 and 99 removal were achieved respectively when using a baf system hasan et al 93 studied the removal of mn ions for high strength and low strength polluted drinking water using a baf system and found removal efficiencies for mn ions of 99 1 and 82 9 for either condition respectively according to yulan et al 94 from the beginning of operation and throughout the entire trial the fe ions removal efficiency was more than 98 using biological aerated filters 5 1 key operation principles of biological aerated filters considering the application of a baf system in water treatment plants for the removal of fe and mn the design requires scrutiny of the parts used for the reactor flow configuration supporting media aeration system and backwash system table 3 summarizes the configuration and dimensions of the baf system a few studies have reported on the design of a baf for the treatment of water at the laboratory scale wherein plexi glass was frequently used as a reactor material the diameter and height of the reactor ranged from 0 1 to 2 m and 0 2 5 1 m respectively as demonstrated in table 3 an up flow configuration was more commonly reported compared with a down flow configuration 5 1 1 supporting media selecting appropriate and suitable supporting media for the baf system is important in the design and operation of the process the best supporting media should be resistant to corrosion and attrition should possess an appropriate specific weight and high specific surface area be chemically dependable 95 durable and easy to manage and should not clog the reactor 8 the media surface acts as housing and as an attachment medium for the biofilm the supporting media are categorized as submerged and floating media as summarized in table 4 submerged media or granular media consist of sand grains zeolite activated carbon and gravel while floating media can be plastics made from polypropylene or polyethylene when using granular media it can be either denser than water to produce sunken media or less dense than water to produce floating media sunken media are commonly used both for down flow or up flow configurations while floating media are only utilized for up flow systems according to wang et al 96 granular media such as gac can occupy more biomass compared to anthracite due to its high specific surface area najm et al 97 proposed that a baf system can be designed to use dual media with a combination of gac or anthracite on the top layer and sand on the bottom layer as reported by ha et al 98 the highest rated performance of a baf system using gravel media was the result of a high specific surface area compared to lava rock and plastic rings 98 on the other hand the use of large supporting media greater than 6 mm reduces the removal of solids due to high void spaces and reduces the area available for biofilm growth and attachment 99 whereas media sizes less than 3 mm enable better filtration and provide a larger surface area for biofilms 100 stembal et al 84 found that small quartz sand grains ranging from 0 5 to 2 0 mm could remove fe and mn ions in three different regions of contaminated groundwater with 80 100 fe removal and 50 95 mn removal the roughness of the media also affects the performance of the baf system rough surface media provides more sites for biofilm attachment than smooth media and has been found to improve the retention of solids 8 thus supporting media selection can be considered an important factor in the design of a baf system in order to ensure sufficient and mature biofilm growth for a high removal efficiency of contaminants as well as fe and mn ions from water 5 1 2 flow configuration of a baf generally up flow configurations operate when influent is introduced at the bottom of the baf concurrent with aeration while down flow configurations operate in a counter current mode with aeration where the influent is introduced at the top of the reactor the up flow baf is widely applied for water treatment but presents some limitations for inorganic removal 101 as seen in table 3 only one researcher has designed a down flow configuration for the removal of ss cod and nh3 n to the best of our knowledge there is no down flow baf system designed for the removal of fe and mn ions 5 1 3 backwash system a backwash system is important in a baf in order to remove excess biomass on the order of approximately 30 102 as well as to maximize the length of the treatment cycle and minimize energy consumption 103 additionally when the head loss or pressure decrease in the filter bed reaches a maximum level the backwashing process phase will initiate 104 furthermore backwashing occurs once flocs begin to break through the filter after which the turbidity in the water filtered effluent increases 37 the frequency of backwashing depends on the size shape density and void porosity of the media in addition to the characteristics of the water to be treated 105 backwash may be performed with solely up flow wash water air scour or with a simultaneous application of air and water wash farabegoli et al 104 postulated that the backwash attained by water alone is often not enough to properly backwash the media it then becomes necessary to apply additional force by bubbling air through the bed which is the so called air scour process however if a baf system has only water available for backwashing a very high backwash rate must be achieved in order to attain the shear forces required for effective media cleaning 104 if air scour is provided then lower backwash rates can be used since the water consequently only serves to flush the dirt from the bed in this case beds are seldom expanded by more than 10 106 thus the simultaneous application of air and water gives and advantage of high cleaning efficiency 107 while producing optimum conditions for removal of deposits from filter grains 108 in terms of economic concern these combination have low water requirement and energy consumption 11 the biomass attached to the filter media must be carefully maintained during backwashing since micro organisms grow during biofilter operation bai et al 109 suggested that low flow rate backwashing performed for a short time can alleviate biofilter clogging and accelerate the start up operation on the other hand biofilters that are not backwashed in the start up operation will become hardened due to clogging from a large amount of biomass and solids along the bottom layer and subsequently it can be difficult to run the filter and perform backwashing 37 backwash rates and frequency are not the same for all biological filters pacini et al 83 concluded that the best combination for the system operated in their study was a filtration rate of 12 m h a backwashing time of 10 min and a backwashing rate of 50 m h katsoyiannis and zouboulis 20 backwashed their biofilter columns every three days which was capable of removing the deposited quantities of fe and mn according to tekerlekopoulou and vayenas 110 backwashing was performed approximately once a week depending on the operating conditions using high water and air up flow velocities and was able to remove the excess amount of biomass and sediment stembal et al 84 applied backwashing processes once every 24 h generally the amount of water required for the backwashing of full scale baf plants was 2 of the total treated water if used for tertiary treatment and 12 35 when used for secondary treatment compared to 0 9 8 3 used in sand and anthracite filters 102 han et al 111 stated that during the long term operation of a baf system backwashing was performed according to the water head loss and turbidity and it was generally conducted once every 7 days in the winter and once every 15 days in the summer another study by hasan et al 11 reported performing a backwash process whenever the baf performance became gradually inefficient for which an average backwash water flow rate was set at 10 l min and adjusted as required through the backwash valve and the air flow rate was fixed at 0 1 l min 11 the effect of backwashing can be explained by ma et al 112 wherein fe and mn outlet concentrations observed 30 min before backwashing were 0 23 mg l and 0 04 mg l respectively which were worse than those of a steady baf operation after backwashing the removal of fe was restored quickly and enhanced by 8 after an hour of operation after which the outlet concentration stabilized baudish 113 operated the filter for approximately three weeks and backwashed every 5 7 days sampling showed that the do levels in the filtered water was above 5 mg l and mn ions was removed from an incoming level of 0 050 mg l to levels generally below the detection limit of 0 005 mg l despite more frequent backwashing biological activity was maintained 5 1 4 aeration supplement an aeration system is a significant parameter in a biological aerated filter baf system wherein the air promotes the growth of biomass in the voids of the media by supplying the required oxygen for the organisms 90 farabegoli et al 104 supplied oxygen via compressed air through four porous stones located at the bottom of the filter bed with an air flow rate of 2 5 l min to maintain an average dissolved oxygen do concentration of more than 3 mg l do strongly influences the performance of a baf system in removing fe and mn ions as it is necessary for microorganisms to grow manganese oxidizing bacteria mnob require more rigorous conditions to oxidize mn ions than those required to oxidize fe ions although fe ions removal can be accomplished at 2 mg l with a do and an initial ph of 7 2 mn ions removal requires a higher do at the same ph 20 a do range of 0 1 mg l and 5 6 mg l o2 were determined as the optimal conditions for iron and manganese oxidizing bacteria respectively 114 under steady operation with a do of 5 mg l the removal of mn ions using a sand filter was reported at 74 3 while fe ions removal was 99 115 according to tekerlekopoulou and vayenas 110 who investigated fe and mn ions removal the do concentration in the liquid phase throughout the trickling filter depth was always between 7 0 and 8 0 mg l lower do levels in a sand filter compared to a trickling filter might be the most efficient selection for the removal of fe and mn ions the oxidation of fe and mn ions will form a precipitate the following reaction shows the oxidation of ferrous iron and manganous manganese by oxygen in eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 4fe hco3 2 o2 2h2o 4fe oh 3 8co2 2 2mn hco3 2 o2 2h2o 2mn oh 4 4co2 one mole of oxygen molecules is needed to react with four moles of fe ions to form four moles of fe precipitate similarly one mole of oxygen molecules is needed to react with two moles of mn ions to form two moles of mn precipitate from these equations it is theoretically confirmed that more oxygen is required for mn ions oxidation compared with that of fe ions 5 2 potential microorganisms as remediating agents in a baf system microorganisms including bacteria yeast and algae are able to remove fe and mn ions whether operating simultaneously or alone table 5 shows the microorganism species responsible for the removal of fe and mn ions overall 82 99 8 removal can be achieved by using those microorganisms microorganisms can be used as a pure or mixed culture in a baf system an analysis of the distribution and genetic diversity of microorganisms by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis dgge indicated that iron oxidizing bacteria iob gallionella leptothrix and mnob leptothrix pseudomonas hyphomicrobium arthrobacter co existed in the biofilm at different filter bed depths and were responsible for the high simultaneous removal of fe and mn ions in the biofilter 116 according to katsoyiannis and zouboulis 20 the oxidation of fe and mn ions were mediated by leptothrix ochracea and gallionella ferruginea with removal efficiencies of up to 97 0 in another study monocultures of leptothrix discophora were the predominant organism in mature mn oxidizing biofilms which can reduce 97 3 of mn 117 in another technique biosorption studies using two yeast species candida tropicalis and issatchenkia orientalis demonstrated the biosorption capacity of fe and mn ions with reductions of 95 5 of mn and 99 8 of fe after 40 days of treatment 118 using a similar technique but different microorganisms hasan et al 51 found that mn uptake by the bacteria species only reached 13 31 mg mn mg biomass 26 removal within a day their uptake may have increased if the time was prolonged high removal efficiencies of both fe and mn ions can be observed using a biosorption method but the method requires longer time and generates more sludge compared to the biofilm method using a baf system a green algae and microbial mat consortium may be a cost effective treatment technique for permanently removing fe and mn ions from mine drainage 119 at 1 m from the influent pipe in an algae mat pond approximately 2 67 mg mn and 34 25 mg fe were deposited in a gram of dried mat 119 schenck et al 120 conducted an experiment using green alga chlamydomonas variabilis as a function of ph to remove fe and mn ions in buffered synthetic solutions over the ph range from 5 to 7 the adsorption of fe and mn ions onto the algae surface was independent relative to ph whereas increased ph had increased the uptake of fe and mn 120 6 possible challenges of iron and manganese removal using baf systems smaller towns communities and individual users in rural areas often rely on local water resources in rural communities the respective removal methods developed for large scale water treatment plants are not easily applicable because of high operational and capital costs or they are simply too complicated and their use is sometimes limited by the specific water composition consequently small drinking water systems face tougher challenges in providing a safe and sufficient supply of drinking water at a reasonable cost 121 attempts have been made to resolve the problem in some areas by installing low cost fe removal units promoted by unicef 122 since 1986 however they are very few in number and the majority of the units do not work properly or are not being used as a result of various operational problems 24 the conventional methods used for the removal of high concentrations of fe and mn ions include chemical dosing or advanced oxidation processes requiring sophisticated process control and operator skills which are a challenge in rural areas 87 moreover redox is the key parameter which determines the sequence of the oxidation of these pollutants wherein fe ions is oxidized at low redox values 200 mv and mn ions needs even higher redox values 400 mv at neutral ph 123 thus the simultaneous removal of these pollutants when present in a water deposit requires several step by step processes or spatial redox variation several problems are associated with the physical chemical treatment for fe and mn ions removal as observed in france 20 years ago whereupon the sources of poorly functioning wtps were due to fe complexion interference by nitrification short oxidation time and low oxidation ph and deterioration of the raw water quality 123 challenges in the treatment of fe and mn ions are also related to the production of metal oxides which can clog pipes and discolour clothes 124 moreover additional potential challenges to be faced in the biological treatment of fe and mn ions in drinking water is to control the non pathogenic microbe introduced along with the treatment 7 future study from this review the treatment of fe and mn ions using an up flow baf system is considered as an alternative to the conventional treatment for safe and clean drinking water production future studies will be focused on the removal of fe and mn ions using non pathogenic microbes that are isolated from the local environment in addition to the treatment three optimal parameters will be varied including the concentration of fe and mn ions empty bed contact time ebct and aeration in order to determine the effectiveness of baf associated biofilm communities on the removal of fe and mn ions the community of non pathogenic microbes will be monitored throughout the study in order to prevent microbial contamination of the treated water this is the main challenge in this study whereby it will be given a high priority in our investigation 8 conclusion in conclusion fe and mn ions can be removed from drinking water either by physicochemical or biological treatments due to some limitations and in order to achieve a good quality of water for drinking purposes biological treatments as well as baf systems are preferable over the implementation of chemical treatments the key factor in the removal of fe and mn ions using a baf system is the design including the aeration and backwash system supporting media and the presence of microorganisms that oxidize fe and mn ions with the advantages of the baf system it would be a potential system for the removal of fe and mn ions in the treatment of drinking water acknowledgements this research was financially supported by the universiti kebangsaan malaysia through grant

14543,this work presents a green and cost effective methodology for the removal of molybdate ions from aqueous solutions using an insoluble chitosan sorbent the kinetic studies demonstrated that the adsorption was very fast less than 15 min representing an improvement compared to literature and followed a pseudo first order kinetic model adsorption equilibrium data were best fitted with the langmuir model where the maximum experimental adsorption capacity was 123 mgmo g 1 at ph 7 8 the scatchard model showed that the sorbent was defined by more than one type of binding sites the free energy from the dubinin radushkevich isotherm model revealed that the adsorption occurred by anion exchange the thermodynamic results indicated that the adsorption was exothermic and was mainly controlled by enthalpic factors the efficiency of this sorbent was more than 87 at low concentrations e g 128 μg l 1 the breakthrough curves described by the thomas model were acquired in real time by instrumental chromatography the sorbent was regenerated five times with a nacl solution with a constant adsorption capacity where a concentration factor of 4000 was achieved keywords molybdenum polysaccharides chitosan sorbent material water treatment fixed bed column adsorption 1 introduction molybdenum is an essential micronutrient as a trace element this transition metal is essential for enzymes and their functions in biological and physiological processes for humans and animals 1 2 however ingestion of molybdenum becomes harmful at high levels and may results in several health problems such as anemia hypothyroidism bone and joint deformities growth delay and sterility 3 the world health organization recommends that molybdenum concentration in drinking water should not exceed 70 μg l 1 molybdenum concentrations in surface waters are typically less than 5 μg l 1 nevertheless it is possible to find concentrations up to milligrams per liter scale in aquatic systems 2 molybdenum can be found naturally in water mainly by alteration of the rocks and water runoff 4 5 levels of molybdenum in drinking water do not usually exceed 10 μg l 1 6 however high molybdenum concentrations were reported in surface water sample and in many mine wastewaters in north america up to 800 000 μg l 1 7 molybdenum is widely used in manufacture of semiconductor and in optoelectronic industry due to its high melting point high strength at elevated temperatures good corrosion resistance and high thermal conductivity 1 5 6 molybdenum is also found in alloys catalysis corrosion inhibitors pigments lubricants and fertilizers 4 heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac systems of buildings contribute to molybdenum consumption which ends up in municipal wastewaters some samples collected from hvac towers contained molybdenum concentrations up to 19 400 μg l 1 8 the molybdate moo4 2 specie exemplifies the main oxidation state of molybdenum mo6 which is water soluble comparatively to most molybdenum compounds molybdenum is not removed from drinking water by traditional treatment processes and needs an additional purification treatment various methods are available to remove such contaminants from wastewater effluents including precipitation membrane and adsorption processes 9 the fast growing use of molybdenum will possibly increase the discharge of molybdenum into aqueous environments adsorption is a fast economical and one of the most efficient processes to eliminate trace metals from water nevertheless the literature focused principally on the removal of as cd hg cr and p 10 activated carbon is a standard adsorbent use for metals adsorption that is expensive 11 the majority of adsorption studies on molybdenum removal were realized at ph 1 3 showing a higher capacity due to the presence of polynuclear anions at those ph compared to mononuclear anions moo4 2 above ph 6 12 15 however several industrial wastewaters that must be treated possess a ph around 7 moreover the mechanism of molybdenum adsorption was not precisely determined in those studies where complexes formation or ion exchange could occur 14 therefore the development of a simple green inexpensive and efficient sorbent material from biomass for molybdate ions removal is essential especially nearby neutral ph recently biomaterials like seagrass brown algae and crab shell chitin were studied for molybdenum vi adsorption in water the seagrass posidonia oceanica was investigated for molybdenum adsorption at ph 3 displaying a capacity of 18 mg g 1 16 the brown algae petalonia fascia has shown a high molybdate adsorption capacity of 1376 mg g 1 at ph 1 and kinetics where equilibrium was reached after around 100 min 17 crab shells chitin gel was studied for metal removal mo fe cu with a maximum adsorption capacity of 252 27 mg mo g 1 at ph 1 18 chitosan is obtained by n deacetylation of chitin which is found in crustacean exoskeletons 9 19 this highly abundant polysaccharide is soluble in diluted aqueous acids 20 its primary amine and hydroxyl groups allow adsorption of metal ions from electrostatic and coordination interactions 21 many works have studied modified chitosan for the removal of transition metals and anions from contaminated water 22 insoluble sorbents based on chitosan are generally formed by reticulation with organic reagents 23 for instance cross linked chitosan beads obtained by reaction with glutaraldehyde have shown to affect the oxidation state of molybdenum during the adsorption process demonstrating the importance to avoid organic reagents 13 moreover the molybdenum sorption with cross linked chitosan beads showed slow kinetics 1000 2000 min that were controlled by intraparticle diffusion 12 13 lately chitosan gel beads exhibited a molybdate adsorption capacity of 265 mg g 1 at ph 2 7 with faster kinetics around 20 min 24 chitosan was found to be a good sorbent for transition metal removal where the regeneration of sorbents in fixed beds was realized with sodium hydroxide hydrochloric acid or sodium chloride solutions 15 23 25 27 in this work we used an insoluble novel chitosan sorbent obtained from a simple and green methodology this chitosan sorbent was applied for molybdenum removal in water and was regenerated several times with constant efficiency kinetics thermodynamics and adsorption isotherms were analyzed with models to acquire a better understanding of the interactions and the mechanism involved in the adsorption process moreover dynamics of fixed bed columns were studied from real time breakthrough curves btc the adsorption of molybdate was also compared to the adsorption of arsenate showing the influence of the nature of the pollutant on the process 2 materials and methods 2 1 general information the chitosan sorbent with a particle size of 75 500 μm average diameter of 192 μm was synthesized by heating the chitosan at 160 c during 16 h followed by a washing step with acetic acid according to brion roby et al 28 chitosan from nordic shrimp exoskeletons pandalus borealis possessing a deacetylation degree of 82 determined by nmr analysis and a viscosity of 20 cp 1 chitosan in 1 acetic acid v v was purchased from primex iceland acetic acid acs grade was bought from fisher scientific nitric acid was metal trace grade from vwr and was used for analytical purposes all other chemicals were of analytical grade and were bought from aldrich deionized water was obtained using a nanopure diamond system model d11931 from barnstead no purification of chemicals was done before use determination of molybdenum concentration in aqueous solutions were realized with a 4200 microwave plasma atomic emission spectrometer mp aes from agilent technologies equipped with a nitrogen generator an autosampler asx 520 cetac and a mp expert software version 1 5 0 6545 btc were measured in real time using an äkta fast protein liquid chromatography fplc from ge healthcare equipped with an uv visible detector and a xk column possessing a diameter of 16 mm the amount of accessible amine groups on the sorbent was measured by acid base titration of a mixture of the sorbent 100 mg in water 40 ml acidified with hydrochloric acid 3 ml of 0 3 m solution the ph was monitored with a ph meter from mettler toledo the quantity of accessible amine groups was determined from the two equivalence point volumes 2 2 batch adsorption the concentration of molybdenum for kinetic experiments was 120 mg l 1 obtained from na2moo4 2h2o chitosan sorbent 0 100 g was used to treat molybdenum solution 50 ml kinetic adsorptions were done in 50 ml falcon centrifuge tubes the tubes were agitated on an orbital shaker from jeio tech at 120 rpm the tubes were then centrifuged immediately with an avanti j e centrifuge from beckman coulter at 5000g during 5 min at rt the supernatant was stored at 4 c until analysis for the isotherm study the specific concentrations were attained by dilution of a molybdenum solution 120 mg l 1 the molybdenum concentrations were between 5 and 120 mg l 1 to fit in the isotherm curve these adsorption experiments were achieved using 300 ml of solution in 500 ml nalgene bottles at ph 7 8 with addition of chitosan sorbent 0 100 g the suspension was stirred with a magnetic bar at 120 rpm during 4 h at 21 c for thermodynamic studies identical experiments were replicated at 45 and 65 c the suspensions were centrifuged and the supernatants were stored as described above all adsorption experiments were done in duplicate with standard deviations lower than 1 8 2 3 quantification of molybdenum concentrations of molybdenum were determined by mp aes linked with a single pass cyclonic spray chamber the method parameters include a wavelength of 379 825 nm a calibration fit linear weighted three readings per sample uptake and rinse times of 25 s and a stabilization time of 15 s the supernatant was directly analyzed without prior digestion the calibration range was between 7 5 120 mg l 1 of molybdenum the detection limit was 0 5 μg l 1 blank of methods were done and no trace of molybdenum was detected all experiments were realized in duplicate or more the adsorption reaction is described in scheme 1 the capacity of the chitosan sorbent was determined using the following equation 1 c s q m o q e q v u m s where cs is the capacity of the sorbent material mgmo g 1 qmo is the available quantity of molybdenum in the medium mg qeq is the equilibrium concentration of molybdenum in the supernatant mg l 1 vu is the volume of the liquid phase l and ms is the weight of the adsorbent g all kinetic and isotherm data were fitted without linearization using matlab version r2014a with the fminsearch matlab function and the nelder mead algorithm 2 4 dynamic experiments in fixed bed columns chitosan sorbent was suspended overnight in water prior to be added in the fixed bed column between two layers of sand table 1 summarizes experimental conditions of the fixed bed columns the feeding solution was pumped at a constant flow rate 2 0 ml min 1 at 21 c the interstitial volume was determined from the weight of water needed to fill the fixed bed column the bed density was calculated from the weight of sorbent divided by the volume of the fixed bed btc were recorded at 209 and 259 nm using the fplc calibration of the uv absorption was realized with standard solutions in accordance to the beer lambert law the response of the detector was linear over 140 mg l 1 of molybdenum at 209 nm and over 180 mg l 1 at 259 nm 3 results and discussion the adsorption capacity of molybdate ions was independent of the particle sizes of sorbent see supporting information the particle sizes ranging between 75 and 500 μm representing 90 of the powder were kept for the adsorption studies the quantity of accessible amine groups was 4 7 mmol g 1 of amine groups corresponding to almost 100 of all amine groups of the sorbent material 3 1 adsorption of molybdate 3 1 1 adsorption kinetics the molybdate adsorption kinetic curve using the chitosan sorbent is presented in fig 1 kinetic curves show that the equilibrium was reached very quickly less than 15 min due to the fast kinetic rate sampling data at the beginning of the adsorption process became complicated the kinetic mechanism was studied using the pseudo first pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion models eqs 2 4 describe the pseudo first order kinetic model the pseudo second order kinetic model and the intraparticle diffusion model respectively 29 30 2 q t q e 1 e x p k 1 t 3 q t q e 2 k 2 t 1 q e k 2 t 4 q t k i p t 0 5 c i where qt is the adsorbed amount mg g 1 at time t min qe is the adsorbed amount mg g 1 at equilibrium k1 is the pseudo first order rate constant min 1 k2 is the pseudo second order rate constant g mg 1 min 1 kip is the constant of intraparticular diffusion rate or pores diffusion mg g 1 min 1 2 and ci is indicating the boundary layer thickness mg g 1 a fitting to a pseudo first order kinetic model proposes that the reaction limiting step is governed mainly by physisorption whereas a fitting to a pseudo second order kinetic model is a suggestion that the process is restricted by chemisorption in the intraparticle diffusion model the limiting step is the diffusion through the pores the parameters obtained from the fitting of experimental data with the three kinetic models are summarized in table 2 both the pseudo first order r2 0 99997 fig 1 and the pseudo second order kinetic models r2 0 99941 describe well the kinetic process due to the lack of data below 15 min thus adsorption kinetics seem to be best described by a pseudo first order kinetic model a rapid kinetic is a significant advantage for water treatment 3 1 2 adsorption isotherms the adsorption is defined by the equilibrium reaction between the sorbent and the pollutant eq 5 the equilibrium constant b is defined by eq 6 where sorbent m is the concentration of product adsorbed mg l 1 sorbent is the concentration of the sorbent mg l 1 and m is the concentration of the pollutant mg l 1 5 sorbent m sorbent m 6 b s o r b e n t m s o r b e n t m the adsorption results were modeled with langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevich d r models based on physical phenomena and with a three variable empirical model from redlich peterson r p those models are expressed respectively by eqs 7 10 31 33 7 q e b q m a x c e 1 b c e 8 q e k c e n 9 q e q m a x e β ε n d 10 q e q m a x b c e 1 b c e n where qe is the amount of pollutant at equilibrium mg g 1 ce is the concentration at equilibrium mg l 1 q max is the maximum adsorption capacity of the pollutant mg l 1 k is the adsorption coefficient defining the strength of adsorption mg g 1 n is a coefficient related to energy of interaction and its variation β is related to the free energy of adsorption mol2 j 2 and nd is equal to 2 in the d r model for the d r model q max was calculated from the fitting of ce and qe expressed in molarity and then reported in mg g 1 table 3 eq 7 is obtained by substituting sorbent m by qe sorbent by qmax qe and m by ce in eq 6 the langmuir model assumes that the adsorption process is a monolayer on the sorbent where all binding sites are homogenous the number of binding sites is constant and the adsorption occurs without interference the freundlich model a special case of the langmuir model corresponds to a heterogeneous multilayer adsorption the freundlich heterogeneity factor 1 n indicates the intensity of the adsorption interaction if the value of n is above unity the adsorption is a favorable physisorption process whereas a value below unity indicates a chemical process the d r model is based on the theory of volume filling of micropores where the adsorption potential ε and the free energy of adsorption j mol 1 are respectively given by eqs 11 and 12 11 ε r t l n 1 1 c e 12 e 1 2 β if this free energy is below 8 kj mol 1 the process is physisorption an energy value between 8 and 16 kj mol 1 corresponds to an ion exchange process and when the free energy is above 20 kj mol 1 the adsorption process is chemisorption 34 the r p model eq 10 a hybrid of langmuir and freundlich models can be used in homogeneous and heterogeneous systems to represent the adsorption equilibrium on a large range in the case of dubinin astakhov d a model the exponent nd is an additional variable which was determined by fitting this exponent provides information about the uniformity of the sorbent a value near the unity indicates that binding sites are heterogeneous whereas a value around three or more is an indication of homogeneity the maximum capacity was reached very rapidly 15 min but a contact time of 4 h was used to ensure that the thermodynamic equilibrium was attained the adsorption equilibriums defined by 10 independent experiments were fitted with four common isotherm models at the three temperatures studied the langmuir model r2 0 9963 at 21 c was the most representative table 3 considering the lower degree of freedom the langmuir model fig 2 was chosen despite the slightly higher r squared value of the r p model the freundlich heterogeneity factor n 0 172 at 21 c table 3 points out that the adsorption process was a chemisorption from the d r isotherm the binding energy of molybdate ions on the sorbent was calculated allowing also the determination of adsorption mode in the studied system this free energy was 18 5 kj mol 1 corresponding to the boundary between ion exchange and chemisorption from isotherm experiments the maximum adsorption capacity was 123 mg g 1 at 21 c which is close to the theoretical langmuir maximum capacity 124 34 mg g 1 and corresponds to the use of 54 of the available amine groups table 3 shows that this theoretical maximum capacity decreases from 21 to 65 c and could be explained by the decreasing of the adsorption equilibrium constant as mentioned earlier in the introduction section the maximum adsorption capacities were mainly reported for ph 1 3 where molybdate ions are found under multinuclear ions leading to higher molybdenum mass per charge ratio therefore the comparison with the literature is difficult the d a isotherm showed very high nd values 9 3 at 21 c demonstrating the homogeneity of the binding sites the adsorption behavior was also analyzed using the scatchard model the scatchard isotherm defined by the following equation gives an indication of the nature of the binding sites 33 35 13 q e c e q m k b q e k b where kb is the scatchard constant determined by plotting q e c e versus qe a deviation from linearity usually points out the presence of more than one type of binding sites at 21 45 and 65 c scatchard isotherms were not linear with r squared values of 0 7508 0 7143 and 0 7077 respectively showing that the sorbent possessed several types of binding sites that could be due to the heterogeneity of the surface 3 2 thermodynamic results the thermodynamic parameters were obtained from the van t hoff eq 14 and the gibbs free energy isotherm eq 15 equations where r is the ideal gas constant 8 314 j k 1 mol 1 and t is the temperature k the variation of gibbs energy during the adsorption process was calculated from eq 15 the equilibrium constant b in l mg 1 must be converted in molarity before application in eq 14 36 the thermodynamic parameters of the molybdate adsorption are presented in table 4 the variation of gibbs energy was negative at all studied temperatures demonstrating the spontaneity of the adsorption process where the major contribution came from enthalpic factors 23 0 kj mol 1 the entropy of the system slightly decreases during the process which was consistent with an anion exchange between acetate first adsorption chloride other adsorptions ions and divalent molybdate anions in water 14 ln b δ h r t δ s r 15 δ g r t l n b 3 3 dynamic results 3 3 1 down flow configuration dynamic results allow to study the applicability of the sorbent in fixed bed columns and to compare with batch adsorptions fixed bed columns were filled with the sorbent and contaminated water 120 mgmo l 1 was fed through the top of the column resulting to clean water until the maximum capacity of the bed was reached btc were acquired in real time by fplc and were modeled the real time monitoring possesses several advantages such as high rate of acquisition 1 hz controlled flow rate and determination of applied pressures and molybdate concentrations through the experiment thus adsorption and desorption btc were composed of 1300 points as shown in fig 3 the adsorption curve progresses inconstantly signifying that the packing of the column is not entirely homogenous despite experimental precautions or that more than one adsorption sites could be present from the scatchard isotherm the latter hypothesis should be considered due to poor linearity of the fit r2 0 7506 at 21 c with this fixed bed and an inlet concentration of 120 mgmo l 1 404 ml of clean water was obtained the column adsorption demonstrates a maximum capacity of 35 mg g 1 however the retention time in the column was less than 15 min which partially explains this lower adsorption capacity compared to isotherm models the adsorption and desorption sequences were realized three times with a down flow configuration the sorbent can be regenerated with nacl solutions 30 g l 1 like seawater which did not interfere with the molybdate uv signal at 209 and 259 nm if this column is fed with an initial concentration of 0 10 mg l 1 the fixed bed would provide almost 4000 l of clean water and the regeneration results in 1 l of concentrated contaminated water those results are thus very promising for large scale applications 3 3 2 up flow configuration the dynamic experiment was also realized with an up flow configuration that is commonly used at laboratory scale the up flow configuration allows a more constant flow and avoids channeling table 5 compares down flow and up flow adsorption experiments the lower capacity in the down flow experiment table 1 could be explained by the fixed bed density in both cases the kinetic time was not respected because the pollutant residence time in the column was less than 15 min several desorption experiments in both flow configurations were realized with a 30 nacl solution to study the regeneration capacity table 5 shows that the capacity is constant inside uncertainty after five regenerations the ideal breakthrough time for a single adsorbate is defined by eq 16 where q max is the maximum capacity from the langmuir isotherm mg g 1 ma is the adsorbent mass g v is the flow rate ml min 1 and co is the inlet concentration mg l 1 the experimental btc show a drastic increase at the beginning of the curve comparatively to the models thus the btc always depend of the isotherm equilibrium and the kinetic rate results 37 results from batch and column adsorptions were significantly different due to the lack of agitation the residence time in the column and the difference in volume of water and in competition between anions 16 t b t s t q m a x m a v c o the thomas yoon nelson and adams bohart models were used to fit the btc of the down flow experiment that are represented respectively by linearized eq 17 19 37 39 17 ln c 0 c t 1 k t q m a x m c q k t c 0 t 18 ln c 0 c 0 c t k y n t τ k y n 19 ln c t c 0 k a b c 0 t k a b n 0 z u 0 where co is the inlet concentration of molybdenum mg l 1 ct is the concentration mg l 1 at time t min kt is the thomas rate constant l min 1 mg 1 q max is the equilibrium uptake of molybdenum mg g 1 mc is the mass of sorbent g q is the flow rate l min 1 kyn is the yoon nelson rate constant min 1 τ is the time required for half of pollutant breakthrough min z is the bed height cm u0 is the superficial velocity cm min 1 n0 is the saturation concentration of the column mg l 1 and kab is the mass transfer coefficient l mg 1 min 1 the thomas model is based on the langmuir and the pseudo second order kinetic models thomas model considers that no axial dispersion occurs in the system the basic assumption of yoon nelson model is that there is proportionality between the reduction of adsorption rate for every single molecule of pollutant and the probability of adsorption of the adsorbate on the sorbent and the probability of adsorbate breakthrough on the sorbent the adams bohart model is based on the surface reaction theory fick s law the model assumes that the equilibrium is not instantaneous because the adsorption is proportional to the concentration of the pollutant and the remaining capacity of the sorbent the parameters of these dynamic models are displayed in table 6 the up flow btc from 5 to 90 of inlet concentration was used for the modelling the dynamic behavior of the fixed bed was best described by thomas and yoon nelson models r2 of 0 9111 when linearization thomas model was applied to the data of the btc the result was not completely linear especially in the beginning of the curve in column adsorption some non linear phenomena can happen for example at the end of the column a higher concentration in counter ions is formed which affects the linearity 3 4 efficiency at low concentrations in order to avoid the utilization of large volume of solutions and to decrease experimental time the experiments in the previous sections were realized at a high concentration 120 mg l 1 batch adsorption experiments 50 ml were conducted at 128 2564 μg l 1 to demonstrate the efficiency of the sorbent at low concentrations table 7 reviews the results obtained at low concentrations where the removal efficiency was higher than 87 3 5 comparison of molybdate and arsenate adsorption results in our previous work the chitosan sorbent was studied for the adsorption of arsenate ions in water kinetics were faster for arsenic 10 min compared to molybdenum 15 min table 8 compares arsenic and molybdenum adsorption at low concentrations in moles g 1 where the molarities are identical arsenate was better sequestrated so the sorbent has a slightly higher affinity for arsenic with a maximum capacity factor as mo of 1 121 at 1 34 μmol l 1 moreover both adsorption capacities were negatively affected by increasing temperatures besides btc had shown a maximum capacity of 480 μmol g 1 for arsenic 28 and 396 μmol g 1 for molybdenum table 5 consequently the chitosan sorbent was also more efficient with arsenic by a factor 1 2 as mo partially due to a slower kinetic for molybdenum adsorption arsenate and molybdate are isostructural anions at working ph ph 8 0 for as and ph 7 8 for mo both anions were found in the divalent state and as mononuclear species i e haso4 2 and moo4 2 the small difference in water ph came only from the anions the molybdate is larger than arsenate ion ionic radii of 0 30 and 0 24 nm respectively resulting in a lower charge density and electrostatic interactions for molybdate 40 41 thus molybdate took a longer time to reach binding sites through the sorbent the scatchard isotherm conclusions were different for the adsorption of molybdate and arsenate in the case of arsenate the scatchard isotherm was linear at 21 and 65 c indicating that the sorbent was composed by only one type of binding sites for molybdate the scatchard isotherms were not linear at the three temperatures studied demonstrating that more than one type of binding sites formed the sorbent this dissimilarity was unexpected and could be attributed to the difference in the donor hydrogen bonding ability and the anion size however in batch adsorption experiments the sorbent is clearly more efficient for molybdenum 1282 μmol g 1 by a factor 2 3 over arsenic 561 μmol g 1 this result could be explained by the electronegativity of arsenic versus molybdenum atoms the oxygen atoms of arsenate possess higher partial charges in comparison with those of molybdate anions the electrostatic interactions with the sorbent were then less important for the arsenate anions and the ion exchange was less effective this result shows that optimization could be needed because the sorbent was very efficient with molybdenum at high concentrations which could be interesting for treatment of concentrated wastewaters 4 conclusions a chitosan sorbent was obtained from a renewable product using a green and low cost methodology that does not involve organic solvents results revealed that this sorbent material is suitable for removal of molybdenum from water generating minimal wastes kinetic studies showed that the sequestration was very rapid 15 min representing an improvement compared to literature the experimental maximum adsorption capacity was 123 mgmo g 1 at ph 7 8 which is best described by the langmuir model the adsorption mechanism occurred by anion exchange as revealed by the calculation of the free energy of the dubinin radushkevich isotherm model the fixed bed column can be easily regenerated using nacl solutions with a constant capacity over five times the thomas and yoon nelson models were the most representative models of the experimental btc water is a natural resource that is not available in sufficient quality for human consumption in all countries our

14543,this work presents a green and cost effective methodology for the removal of molybdate ions from aqueous solutions using an insoluble chitosan sorbent the kinetic studies demonstrated that the adsorption was very fast less than 15 min representing an improvement compared to literature and followed a pseudo first order kinetic model adsorption equilibrium data were best fitted with the langmuir model where the maximum experimental adsorption capacity was 123 mgmo g 1 at ph 7 8 the scatchard model showed that the sorbent was defined by more than one type of binding sites the free energy from the dubinin radushkevich isotherm model revealed that the adsorption occurred by anion exchange the thermodynamic results indicated that the adsorption was exothermic and was mainly controlled by enthalpic factors the efficiency of this sorbent was more than 87 at low concentrations e g 128 μg l 1 the breakthrough curves described by the thomas model were acquired in real time by instrumental chromatography the sorbent was regenerated five times with a nacl solution with a constant adsorption capacity where a concentration factor of 4000 was achieved keywords molybdenum polysaccharides chitosan sorbent material water treatment fixed bed column adsorption 1 introduction molybdenum is an essential micronutrient as a trace element this transition metal is essential for enzymes and their functions in biological and physiological processes for humans and animals 1 2 however ingestion of molybdenum becomes harmful at high levels and may results in several health problems such as anemia hypothyroidism bone and joint deformities growth delay and sterility 3 the world health organization recommends that molybdenum concentration in drinking water should not exceed 70 μg l 1 molybdenum concentrations in surface waters are typically less than 5 μg l 1 nevertheless it is possible to find concentrations up to milligrams per liter scale in aquatic systems 2 molybdenum can be found naturally in water mainly by alteration of the rocks and water runoff 4 5 levels of molybdenum in drinking water do not usually exceed 10 μg l 1 6 however high molybdenum concentrations were reported in surface water sample and in many mine wastewaters in north america up to 800 000 μg l 1 7 molybdenum is widely used in manufacture of semiconductor and in optoelectronic industry due to its high melting point high strength at elevated temperatures good corrosion resistance and high thermal conductivity 1 5 6 molybdenum is also found in alloys catalysis corrosion inhibitors pigments lubricants and fertilizers 4 heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac systems of buildings contribute to molybdenum consumption which ends up in municipal wastewaters some samples collected from hvac towers contained molybdenum concentrations up to 19 400 μg l 1 8 the molybdate moo4 2 specie exemplifies the main oxidation state of molybdenum mo6 which is water soluble comparatively to most molybdenum compounds molybdenum is not removed from drinking water by traditional treatment processes and needs an additional purification treatment various methods are available to remove such contaminants from wastewater effluents including precipitation membrane and adsorption processes 9 the fast growing use of molybdenum will possibly increase the discharge of molybdenum into aqueous environments adsorption is a fast economical and one of the most efficient processes to eliminate trace metals from water nevertheless the literature focused principally on the removal of as cd hg cr and p 10 activated carbon is a standard adsorbent use for metals adsorption that is expensive 11 the majority of adsorption studies on molybdenum removal were realized at ph 1 3 showing a higher capacity due to the presence of polynuclear anions at those ph compared to mononuclear anions moo4 2 above ph 6 12 15 however several industrial wastewaters that must be treated possess a ph around 7 moreover the mechanism of molybdenum adsorption was not precisely determined in those studies where complexes formation or ion exchange could occur 14 therefore the development of a simple green inexpensive and efficient sorbent material from biomass for molybdate ions removal is essential especially nearby neutral ph recently biomaterials like seagrass brown algae and crab shell chitin were studied for molybdenum vi adsorption in water the seagrass posidonia oceanica was investigated for molybdenum adsorption at ph 3 displaying a capacity of 18 mg g 1 16 the brown algae petalonia fascia has shown a high molybdate adsorption capacity of 1376 mg g 1 at ph 1 and kinetics where equilibrium was reached after around 100 min 17 crab shells chitin gel was studied for metal removal mo fe cu with a maximum adsorption capacity of 252 27 mg mo g 1 at ph 1 18 chitosan is obtained by n deacetylation of chitin which is found in crustacean exoskeletons 9 19 this highly abundant polysaccharide is soluble in diluted aqueous acids 20 its primary amine and hydroxyl groups allow adsorption of metal ions from electrostatic and coordination interactions 21 many works have studied modified chitosan for the removal of transition metals and anions from contaminated water 22 insoluble sorbents based on chitosan are generally formed by reticulation with organic reagents 23 for instance cross linked chitosan beads obtained by reaction with glutaraldehyde have shown to affect the oxidation state of molybdenum during the adsorption process demonstrating the importance to avoid organic reagents 13 moreover the molybdenum sorption with cross linked chitosan beads showed slow kinetics 1000 2000 min that were controlled by intraparticle diffusion 12 13 lately chitosan gel beads exhibited a molybdate adsorption capacity of 265 mg g 1 at ph 2 7 with faster kinetics around 20 min 24 chitosan was found to be a good sorbent for transition metal removal where the regeneration of sorbents in fixed beds was realized with sodium hydroxide hydrochloric acid or sodium chloride solutions 15 23 25 27 in this work we used an insoluble novel chitosan sorbent obtained from a simple and green methodology this chitosan sorbent was applied for molybdenum removal in water and was regenerated several times with constant efficiency kinetics thermodynamics and adsorption isotherms were analyzed with models to acquire a better understanding of the interactions and the mechanism involved in the adsorption process moreover dynamics of fixed bed columns were studied from real time breakthrough curves btc the adsorption of molybdate was also compared to the adsorption of arsenate showing the influence of the nature of the pollutant on the process 2 materials and methods 2 1 general information the chitosan sorbent with a particle size of 75 500 μm average diameter of 192 μm was synthesized by heating the chitosan at 160 c during 16 h followed by a washing step with acetic acid according to brion roby et al 28 chitosan from nordic shrimp exoskeletons pandalus borealis possessing a deacetylation degree of 82 determined by nmr analysis and a viscosity of 20 cp 1 chitosan in 1 acetic acid v v was purchased from primex iceland acetic acid acs grade was bought from fisher scientific nitric acid was metal trace grade from vwr and was used for analytical purposes all other chemicals were of analytical grade and were bought from aldrich deionized water was obtained using a nanopure diamond system model d11931 from barnstead no purification of chemicals was done before use determination of molybdenum concentration in aqueous solutions were realized with a 4200 microwave plasma atomic emission spectrometer mp aes from agilent technologies equipped with a nitrogen generator an autosampler asx 520 cetac and a mp expert software version 1 5 0 6545 btc were measured in real time using an äkta fast protein liquid chromatography fplc from ge healthcare equipped with an uv visible detector and a xk column possessing a diameter of 16 mm the amount of accessible amine groups on the sorbent was measured by acid base titration of a mixture of the sorbent 100 mg in water 40 ml acidified with hydrochloric acid 3 ml of 0 3 m solution the ph was monitored with a ph meter from mettler toledo the quantity of accessible amine groups was determined from the two equivalence point volumes 2 2 batch adsorption the concentration of molybdenum for kinetic experiments was 120 mg l 1 obtained from na2moo4 2h2o chitosan sorbent 0 100 g was used to treat molybdenum solution 50 ml kinetic adsorptions were done in 50 ml falcon centrifuge tubes the tubes were agitated on an orbital shaker from jeio tech at 120 rpm the tubes were then centrifuged immediately with an avanti j e centrifuge from beckman coulter at 5000g during 5 min at rt the supernatant was stored at 4 c until analysis for the isotherm study the specific concentrations were attained by dilution of a molybdenum solution 120 mg l 1 the molybdenum concentrations were between 5 and 120 mg l 1 to fit in the isotherm curve these adsorption experiments were achieved using 300 ml of solution in 500 ml nalgene bottles at ph 7 8 with addition of chitosan sorbent 0 100 g the suspension was stirred with a magnetic bar at 120 rpm during 4 h at 21 c for thermodynamic studies identical experiments were replicated at 45 and 65 c the suspensions were centrifuged and the supernatants were stored as described above all adsorption experiments were done in duplicate with standard deviations lower than 1 8 2 3 quantification of molybdenum concentrations of molybdenum were determined by mp aes linked with a single pass cyclonic spray chamber the method parameters include a wavelength of 379 825 nm a calibration fit linear weighted three readings per sample uptake and rinse times of 25 s and a stabilization time of 15 s the supernatant was directly analyzed without prior digestion the calibration range was between 7 5 120 mg l 1 of molybdenum the detection limit was 0 5 μg l 1 blank of methods were done and no trace of molybdenum was detected all experiments were realized in duplicate or more the adsorption reaction is described in scheme 1 the capacity of the chitosan sorbent was determined using the following equation 1 c s q m o q e q v u m s where cs is the capacity of the sorbent material mgmo g 1 qmo is the available quantity of molybdenum in the medium mg qeq is the equilibrium concentration of molybdenum in the supernatant mg l 1 vu is the volume of the liquid phase l and ms is the weight of the adsorbent g all kinetic and isotherm data were fitted without linearization using matlab version r2014a with the fminsearch matlab function and the nelder mead algorithm 2 4 dynamic experiments in fixed bed columns chitosan sorbent was suspended overnight in water prior to be added in the fixed bed column between two layers of sand table 1 summarizes experimental conditions of the fixed bed columns the feeding solution was pumped at a constant flow rate 2 0 ml min 1 at 21 c the interstitial volume was determined from the weight of water needed to fill the fixed bed column the bed density was calculated from the weight of sorbent divided by the volume of the fixed bed btc were recorded at 209 and 259 nm using the fplc calibration of the uv absorption was realized with standard solutions in accordance to the beer lambert law the response of the detector was linear over 140 mg l 1 of molybdenum at 209 nm and over 180 mg l 1 at 259 nm 3 results and discussion the adsorption capacity of molybdate ions was independent of the particle sizes of sorbent see supporting information the particle sizes ranging between 75 and 500 μm representing 90 of the powder were kept for the adsorption studies the quantity of accessible amine groups was 4 7 mmol g 1 of amine groups corresponding to almost 100 of all amine groups of the sorbent material 3 1 adsorption of molybdate 3 1 1 adsorption kinetics the molybdate adsorption kinetic curve using the chitosan sorbent is presented in fig 1 kinetic curves show that the equilibrium was reached very quickly less than 15 min due to the fast kinetic rate sampling data at the beginning of the adsorption process became complicated the kinetic mechanism was studied using the pseudo first pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion models eqs 2 4 describe the pseudo first order kinetic model the pseudo second order kinetic model and the intraparticle diffusion model respectively 29 30 2 q t q e 1 e x p k 1 t 3 q t q e 2 k 2 t 1 q e k 2 t 4 q t k i p t 0 5 c i where qt is the adsorbed amount mg g 1 at time t min qe is the adsorbed amount mg g 1 at equilibrium k1 is the pseudo first order rate constant min 1 k2 is the pseudo second order rate constant g mg 1 min 1 kip is the constant of intraparticular diffusion rate or pores diffusion mg g 1 min 1 2 and ci is indicating the boundary layer thickness mg g 1 a fitting to a pseudo first order kinetic model proposes that the reaction limiting step is governed mainly by physisorption whereas a fitting to a pseudo second order kinetic model is a suggestion that the process is restricted by chemisorption in the intraparticle diffusion model the limiting step is the diffusion through the pores the parameters obtained from the fitting of experimental data with the three kinetic models are summarized in table 2 both the pseudo first order r2 0 99997 fig 1 and the pseudo second order kinetic models r2 0 99941 describe well the kinetic process due to the lack of data below 15 min thus adsorption kinetics seem to be best described by a pseudo first order kinetic model a rapid kinetic is a significant advantage for water treatment 3 1 2 adsorption isotherms the adsorption is defined by the equilibrium reaction between the sorbent and the pollutant eq 5 the equilibrium constant b is defined by eq 6 where sorbent m is the concentration of product adsorbed mg l 1 sorbent is the concentration of the sorbent mg l 1 and m is the concentration of the pollutant mg l 1 5 sorbent m sorbent m 6 b s o r b e n t m s o r b e n t m the adsorption results were modeled with langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevich d r models based on physical phenomena and with a three variable empirical model from redlich peterson r p those models are expressed respectively by eqs 7 10 31 33 7 q e b q m a x c e 1 b c e 8 q e k c e n 9 q e q m a x e β ε n d 10 q e q m a x b c e 1 b c e n where qe is the amount of pollutant at equilibrium mg g 1 ce is the concentration at equilibrium mg l 1 q max is the maximum adsorption capacity of the pollutant mg l 1 k is the adsorption coefficient defining the strength of adsorption mg g 1 n is a coefficient related to energy of interaction and its variation β is related to the free energy of adsorption mol2 j 2 and nd is equal to 2 in the d r model for the d r model q max was calculated from the fitting of ce and qe expressed in molarity and then reported in mg g 1 table 3 eq 7 is obtained by substituting sorbent m by qe sorbent by qmax qe and m by ce in eq 6 the langmuir model assumes that the adsorption process is a monolayer on the sorbent where all binding sites are homogenous the number of binding sites is constant and the adsorption occurs without interference the freundlich model a special case of the langmuir model corresponds to a heterogeneous multilayer adsorption the freundlich heterogeneity factor 1 n indicates the intensity of the adsorption interaction if the value of n is above unity the adsorption is a favorable physisorption process whereas a value below unity indicates a chemical process the d r model is based on the theory of volume filling of micropores where the adsorption potential ε and the free energy of adsorption j mol 1 are respectively given by eqs 11 and 12 11 ε r t l n 1 1 c e 12 e 1 2 β if this free energy is below 8 kj mol 1 the process is physisorption an energy value between 8 and 16 kj mol 1 corresponds to an ion exchange process and when the free energy is above 20 kj mol 1 the adsorption process is chemisorption 34 the r p model eq 10 a hybrid of langmuir and freundlich models can be used in homogeneous and heterogeneous systems to represent the adsorption equilibrium on a large range in the case of dubinin astakhov d a model the exponent nd is an additional variable which was determined by fitting this exponent provides information about the uniformity of the sorbent a value near the unity indicates that binding sites are heterogeneous whereas a value around three or more is an indication of homogeneity the maximum capacity was reached very rapidly 15 min but a contact time of 4 h was used to ensure that the thermodynamic equilibrium was attained the adsorption equilibriums defined by 10 independent experiments were fitted with four common isotherm models at the three temperatures studied the langmuir model r2 0 9963 at 21 c was the most representative table 3 considering the lower degree of freedom the langmuir model fig 2 was chosen despite the slightly higher r squared value of the r p model the freundlich heterogeneity factor n 0 172 at 21 c table 3 points out that the adsorption process was a chemisorption from the d r isotherm the binding energy of molybdate ions on the sorbent was calculated allowing also the determination of adsorption mode in the studied system this free energy was 18 5 kj mol 1 corresponding to the boundary between ion exchange and chemisorption from isotherm experiments the maximum adsorption capacity was 123 mg g 1 at 21 c which is close to the theoretical langmuir maximum capacity 124 34 mg g 1 and corresponds to the use of 54 of the available amine groups table 3 shows that this theoretical maximum capacity decreases from 21 to 65 c and could be explained by the decreasing of the adsorption equilibrium constant as mentioned earlier in the introduction section the maximum adsorption capacities were mainly reported for ph 1 3 where molybdate ions are found under multinuclear ions leading to higher molybdenum mass per charge ratio therefore the comparison with the literature is difficult the d a isotherm showed very high nd values 9 3 at 21 c demonstrating the homogeneity of the binding sites the adsorption behavior was also analyzed using the scatchard model the scatchard isotherm defined by the following equation gives an indication of the nature of the binding sites 33 35 13 q e c e q m k b q e k b where kb is the scatchard constant determined by plotting q e c e versus qe a deviation from linearity usually points out the presence of more than one type of binding sites at 21 45 and 65 c scatchard isotherms were not linear with r squared values of 0 7508 0 7143 and 0 7077 respectively showing that the sorbent possessed several types of binding sites that could be due to the heterogeneity of the surface 3 2 thermodynamic results the thermodynamic parameters were obtained from the van t hoff eq 14 and the gibbs free energy isotherm eq 15 equations where r is the ideal gas constant 8 314 j k 1 mol 1 and t is the temperature k the variation of gibbs energy during the adsorption process was calculated from eq 15 the equilibrium constant b in l mg 1 must be converted in molarity before application in eq 14 36 the thermodynamic parameters of the molybdate adsorption are presented in table 4 the variation of gibbs energy was negative at all studied temperatures demonstrating the spontaneity of the adsorption process where the major contribution came from enthalpic factors 23 0 kj mol 1 the entropy of the system slightly decreases during the process which was consistent with an anion exchange between acetate first adsorption chloride other adsorptions ions and divalent molybdate anions in water 14 ln b δ h r t δ s r 15 δ g r t l n b 3 3 dynamic results 3 3 1 down flow configuration dynamic results allow to study the applicability of the sorbent in fixed bed columns and to compare with batch adsorptions fixed bed columns were filled with the sorbent and contaminated water 120 mgmo l 1 was fed through the top of the column resulting to clean water until the maximum capacity of the bed was reached btc were acquired in real time by fplc and were modeled the real time monitoring possesses several advantages such as high rate of acquisition 1 hz controlled flow rate and determination of applied pressures and molybdate concentrations through the experiment thus adsorption and desorption btc were composed of 1300 points as shown in fig 3 the adsorption curve progresses inconstantly signifying that the packing of the column is not entirely homogenous despite experimental precautions or that more than one adsorption sites could be present from the scatchard isotherm the latter hypothesis should be considered due to poor linearity of the fit r2 0 7506 at 21 c with this fixed bed and an inlet concentration of 120 mgmo l 1 404 ml of clean water was obtained the column adsorption demonstrates a maximum capacity of 35 mg g 1 however the retention time in the column was less than 15 min which partially explains this lower adsorption capacity compared to isotherm models the adsorption and desorption sequences were realized three times with a down flow configuration the sorbent can be regenerated with nacl solutions 30 g l 1 like seawater which did not interfere with the molybdate uv signal at 209 and 259 nm if this column is fed with an initial concentration of 0 10 mg l 1 the fixed bed would provide almost 4000 l of clean water and the regeneration results in 1 l of concentrated contaminated water those results are thus very promising for large scale applications 3 3 2 up flow configuration the dynamic experiment was also realized with an up flow configuration that is commonly used at laboratory scale the up flow configuration allows a more constant flow and avoids channeling table 5 compares down flow and up flow adsorption experiments the lower capacity in the down flow experiment table 1 could be explained by the fixed bed density in both cases the kinetic time was not respected because the pollutant residence time in the column was less than 15 min several desorption experiments in both flow configurations were realized with a 30 nacl solution to study the regeneration capacity table 5 shows that the capacity is constant inside uncertainty after five regenerations the ideal breakthrough time for a single adsorbate is defined by eq 16 where q max is the maximum capacity from the langmuir isotherm mg g 1 ma is the adsorbent mass g v is the flow rate ml min 1 and co is the inlet concentration mg l 1 the experimental btc show a drastic increase at the beginning of the curve comparatively to the models thus the btc always depend of the isotherm equilibrium and the kinetic rate results 37 results from batch and column adsorptions were significantly different due to the lack of agitation the residence time in the column and the difference in volume of water and in competition between anions 16 t b t s t q m a x m a v c o the thomas yoon nelson and adams bohart models were used to fit the btc of the down flow experiment that are represented respectively by linearized eq 17 19 37 39 17 ln c 0 c t 1 k t q m a x m c q k t c 0 t 18 ln c 0 c 0 c t k y n t τ k y n 19 ln c t c 0 k a b c 0 t k a b n 0 z u 0 where co is the inlet concentration of molybdenum mg l 1 ct is the concentration mg l 1 at time t min kt is the thomas rate constant l min 1 mg 1 q max is the equilibrium uptake of molybdenum mg g 1 mc is the mass of sorbent g q is the flow rate l min 1 kyn is the yoon nelson rate constant min 1 τ is the time required for half of pollutant breakthrough min z is the bed height cm u0 is the superficial velocity cm min 1 n0 is the saturation concentration of the column mg l 1 and kab is the mass transfer coefficient l mg 1 min 1 the thomas model is based on the langmuir and the pseudo second order kinetic models thomas model considers that no axial dispersion occurs in the system the basic assumption of yoon nelson model is that there is proportionality between the reduction of adsorption rate for every single molecule of pollutant and the probability of adsorption of the adsorbate on the sorbent and the probability of adsorbate breakthrough on the sorbent the adams bohart model is based on the surface reaction theory fick s law the model assumes that the equilibrium is not instantaneous because the adsorption is proportional to the concentration of the pollutant and the remaining capacity of the sorbent the parameters of these dynamic models are displayed in table 6 the up flow btc from 5 to 90 of inlet concentration was used for the modelling the dynamic behavior of the fixed bed was best described by thomas and yoon nelson models r2 of 0 9111 when linearization thomas model was applied to the data of the btc the result was not completely linear especially in the beginning of the curve in column adsorption some non linear phenomena can happen for example at the end of the column a higher concentration in counter ions is formed which affects the linearity 3 4 efficiency at low concentrations in order to avoid the utilization of large volume of solutions and to decrease experimental time the experiments in the previous sections were realized at a high concentration 120 mg l 1 batch adsorption experiments 50 ml were conducted at 128 2564 μg l 1 to demonstrate the efficiency of the sorbent at low concentrations table 7 reviews the results obtained at low concentrations where the removal efficiency was higher than 87 3 5 comparison of molybdate and arsenate adsorption results in our previous work the chitosan sorbent was studied for the adsorption of arsenate ions in water kinetics were faster for arsenic 10 min compared to molybdenum 15 min table 8 compares arsenic and molybdenum adsorption at low concentrations in moles g 1 where the molarities are identical arsenate was better sequestrated so the sorbent has a slightly higher affinity for arsenic with a maximum capacity factor as mo of 1 121 at 1 34 μmol l 1 moreover both adsorption capacities were negatively affected by increasing temperatures besides btc had shown a maximum capacity of 480 μmol g 1 for arsenic 28 and 396 μmol g 1 for molybdenum table 5 consequently the chitosan sorbent was also more efficient with arsenic by a factor 1 2 as mo partially due to a slower kinetic for molybdenum adsorption arsenate and molybdate are isostructural anions at working ph ph 8 0 for as and ph 7 8 for mo both anions were found in the divalent state and as mononuclear species i e haso4 2 and moo4 2 the small difference in water ph came only from the anions the molybdate is larger than arsenate ion ionic radii of 0 30 and 0 24 nm respectively resulting in a lower charge density and electrostatic interactions for molybdate 40 41 thus molybdate took a longer time to reach binding sites through the sorbent the scatchard isotherm conclusions were different for the adsorption of molybdate and arsenate in the case of arsenate the scatchard isotherm was linear at 21 and 65 c indicating that the sorbent was composed by only one type of binding sites for molybdate the scatchard isotherms were not linear at the three temperatures studied demonstrating that more than one type of binding sites formed the sorbent this dissimilarity was unexpected and could be attributed to the difference in the donor hydrogen bonding ability and the anion size however in batch adsorption experiments the sorbent is clearly more efficient for molybdenum 1282 μmol g 1 by a factor 2 3 over arsenic 561 μmol g 1 this result could be explained by the electronegativity of arsenic versus molybdenum atoms the oxygen atoms of arsenate possess higher partial charges in comparison with those of molybdate anions the electrostatic interactions with the sorbent were then less important for the arsenate anions and the ion exchange was less effective this result shows that optimization could be needed because the sorbent was very efficient with molybdenum at high concentrations which could be interesting for treatment of concentrated wastewaters 4 conclusions a chitosan sorbent was obtained from a renewable product using a green and low cost methodology that does not involve organic solvents results revealed that this sorbent material is suitable for removal of molybdenum from water generating minimal wastes kinetic studies showed that the sequestration was very rapid 15 min representing an improvement compared to literature the experimental maximum adsorption capacity was 123 mgmo g 1 at ph 7 8 which is best described by the langmuir model the adsorption mechanism occurred by anion exchange as revealed by the calculation of the free energy of the dubinin radushkevich isotherm model the fixed bed column can be easily regenerated using nacl solutions with a constant capacity over five times the thomas and yoon nelson models were the most representative models of the experimental btc water is a natural resource that is not available in sufficient quality for human consumption in all countries our results showed that this material is promising for large scale sustainable water treatments the effects on the adsorption efficiency of competitive ions as the scale up procedure to treat several

14544,the growth of the human population shrinking seafood supply and polluted seawater are amongst the reasons that have encouraged a more stringent practice of water management in the aquaculture industry the productivity of cultured shrimps is greatly restricted by limited access to clean seawater for aquaculture areas however which lack leads to severe disease outbreaks and reduced shrimp survival rates water management has thus become the core issue for increasing shrimp production by reducing the contamination from fresh water intake fresh water usage and aquaculture wastewater discharge the objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of setting up an integrated recirculating aquaculture system using the membrane technology which possibly utilizes microfiltration ultrafiltration nanofiltration or reverse osmosis modules to improve the quality of aquaculture water while minimize the wastewater discharge and increase the water reuse feasibility of the integrated recirculating aquaculture system will be evaluated based on the effectiveness of improvement on the aquaculture water quality and limitations of the current membrane technologies this study is highly

article will discuss the importance of water management in shrimp farming industry and their current stage of research and development in addition this review article will discuss the water quality requirements based on the key parameters in shrimp farming in order to increase the shrimp survival rates and prevent massive disease outbreaks in the culture ponds lastly this review article will evaluate the possibility of integrating membrane technology into shrimp farming industry based on their separation performance and their previous usages in aquaculture industry by analysing designs of recirculating aquaculture systems that have been studied by other researchers an integrated recirculating aquaculture system will be proposed at the end of this review article to allow researchers to conduct data collection and investigation in the near future 2 importance of water management in shrimp farming industry continuous development of desalination and water treatment technology has encouraged its employment in aquaculture water pre treatment and reclamation stages over 50 of the global shrimp supply for human consumption has been obtained in shrimp farming activity since 2006 1 fig 1 shows the world aquaculture production for crustaceans from 2006 to 2015 the world aquaculture production for crustaceans has increased to around 68 from year 2006 2015 fig 2 shows the fishery product exportation amount from top five exporting countries from 2013 to 2015 china appears to be the leading country in both aquaculture production and exportation of fishery commodities based on a research work that was previously conducted every single tonne of shrimp aquaculture production can be translated into 5345 7157 m3 of effluent discharge 2 based on the world aquaculture production for crustaceans effluent discharge from the aquaculture industry around the world can be close to 3 74 1010 m3 with the assumption that no recirculating aquaculture system is used for water treatment the importance of the shrimp industry to global economic growth can be clearly seen through shrimp exportation 4 and related research activities according to data obtained from indexed databases there was significant growth in shrimp aquaculture related publications from 1969 to 2016 fig 3 in addition to being a driving force from the economic perspective continual advances in science and technology have also contributed to the involvement of various countries in shrimp related studies united states thailand and india are the top countries that actively playing a role in shrimp research and development fig 4 the global supply of shrimp products and its development is still restricted by poor water management however which could possibly contribute to a massive disease outbreak 5 as in finfish aquaculture the food supplied to shrimp aquaculture systems will generate a large amount of organic matter and nutrients mostly phosphorus and nitrogen as metabolic waste 6 these compounds will compete with aquatic animals for the dissolved oxygen in water this will contribute to the asphyxiation of aquatic lives and thus a high mortality rate in aquaculture industries without a proper and efficient water management system critical water management system by integrating various water treatment technologies is important in providing a healthy environment for shrimp farming pond water quality is crucial in the prevention of disease outbreaks caused by pathogens such as viruses fungi or bacteria shrimp pond water management plays an important role in preventing massive disease outbreak and major production losses by increasing the survival rate of cultured shrimp which is especially significant when using the intensive shrimp farming method disinfectants are normally added to the water during the shrimp farming as part of viral control 7 the employment of disinfectants in japan china and thailand all have resulted in failures 153 the presence of diseases in the shrimp farming industry can have disastrous effects on shrimp production and economic development 9 the situation can be worsened by the spread of diseases to neighbouring ponds through the discharge of pond water into the environment efforts have thus been made to minimise disease spread such as a minimising water exchange during the culture period 10 water exchange is a common practice used to obtain fresh water with reduced pollutants 11 but water exchange increases the risk of introducing infectious diseases to farms in the absence of proper water filtration systems b micro screening with 100 300 μm meshes to prevent the viral carrier organisms and tissue fragments entering the pond system such a prevention method is similarly not so effective owing to the fact that most of the water borne viruses are having sizes less than 100 μm 3 water quality requirements in shrimp farming and their possible effects to the membranes information on the effects of water quality parameters on shrimp farming industry is greatly required in order to have a better design of the water management system that suit this application 12 close monitoring of shrimp pond water quality makes the control and prediction of the possible occurrences of undesired conditions during cultivation possible 13 this will also minimise the environmental damage causes by frequent water exchange 14 and wastewater discharge and termination of the production process through proper water quality control 15 table 1 shows water exchange requirement in the culture of various marine shrimp species a pond water ph an effective implementation of membrane modules in a recirculating aquaculture system will require an evaluation of the water ph owing to the fact that water ph can alter the membrane surface charges and their effectiveness in solute retention 21 22 optimal water ph for most marine shrimp growth has been reported to be within the range of 6 0 9 0 23 but varies depending on the adaptation of shrimp and shrimp species for instance ph 7 5 8 5 has been reported as optimal ph for black tiger shrimp with a daily fluctuation not more than 0 3 24 but fluctuation of the pond water ph is unavoidable due to the different behaviour of the living organisms during different day periods 25 an extremely low level of ph at 3 7 has been reported to be the 96 h lc50 median lethal concentration for tiger shrimp penaeus monodon 25 low ph levels of 4 9 6 4 have been reported to retard the growth of penaeus monodon 25 pond water ph has been well related to its toxicity effect towards the aquatic organisms owing to its ability to change the concentration of either ionized or un ionized ammonia ions according to a reported work 26 ionized ammonia species nh4 has been determined to be less toxic to aquatic life when compared to unionized ammonia molecules nh3 because ionized ammonia species is less permeable in the cell membranes of aquatic life the species of ammonia present in the aqueous solution is highly dependent on the chemical equilibrium which is affected by the solution ph and can be represented by chemical equation eq 1 according to them low ph will reduce the formation of unionized ammonia that lead to a less toxic environment to the aquatic life at higher ph environment higher hydroxide ion concentration will shift the chemical equilibrium towards the formation of higher concentration of unionized ammonia thus forming a more toxic environment to the aquatic life 1 n h 3 g n h 2 o l n h 3 n h 2 o a q n h 4 o h n 1 h 2 o l conversely ph 9 0 9 5 has been reported to reduce the total haemocyte count thc and the phenoloxidase po activity of the freshwater prawn macrobrachium rosenbergii and its resistance against lactococcus garvieae for macrobrachium rosenbergii reared at ph 4 6 5 2 low ph range and ph 8 8 9 5 high ph range it was more susceptible to lactococcus garvieae compared to those reared at normal ph ph 7 5 7 7 25 this has been explained by the increased phagocytic activity and clearance efficiency of the macrobrachium rosenbergii against lactococcus garvieae optimum ph for the culture of litopenaeus vannamei however was reported to be at ph 8 2 owing to the finding that the shrimps reared at ph 6 5 and 10 1 exhibited low phagocytic activities and clearance efficiency to vibrio alginolyticus 25 based on these optimal ph condition ph 6 0 9 0 most of the common membrane materials such as polyethersulfone cellulose triacetate and polysulfone will be negatively charged 27 28 during their normal application in recirculating aquaculture system under these circumstances these membrane should exhibit higher rejection towards the negatively charged particulates anions and organic matters 29 that present in the pond water owing to the donnan effect polymeric membranes with low ph tolerances can be considered for this application with no significant losses in retention performances 30 pond water salinity a constant salinity profile is highly preferable for the growth of shrimp during farming activity 23 because it plays an important role in the osmoregulation of the cultured species 31 constant salinity profile in recirculating aquaculture system can possibly be achieved through proper selection of the membrane type that removes only unwanted particulates microfiltration and ultrafiltration membranes can be considered for this purpose which can return most of the salt ions back into the aquaculture system to maintain the desired salinity profile 32 the suitability of pond water salinity will depend on the adaptation of the shrimp and varies between species 33 and development stages refer to table 2 34 while low salinity also has been reported 35 different species of shrimp will have different iso osmotic points between hemolymph with seawater depending on the physiological relationship between salinity and metabolism 36 most of the penaeid shrimps however are euryhaline shrimps that can regulate the osmolality of body fluids to adapt a wide range of salinities 37 salinity of pond water in addition has been linked with the concentration of dissolved oxygen 36 this has been explained by lower diffusivity of oxygen molecules in water with higher salinity lower dissolved oxygen content thus led to a lower metabolism of cultured shrimps in response to lower oxygen consumption which were verified with lower shrimp growth rates 36 according to the reported work lower shrimp growth rates at higher water salinities also have been explained by higher infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis ihhn virus infections 36 as most white shrimp litopenaeus vannamei farming has been restricted by the expensive coastal aquaculture land access to clean or pollution free seawater and the emergence of the viral diseases shrimp production at extremely low salinities has been introduced 35 research has demonstrated a shrimp survival rate of 76 1 at 210 days with an average individual weight of 11 72 g using freshwater with 0 ppt salinity 35 undeniably shrimp farming using water at low salinity appears a better alternative so as to minimise dependency on seawater while possibly preventing major disease outbreak caused by polluted seawater recent development in the nanofiltration composite membranes having high salt selectivity 38 together with reverse osmosis modules and other desalination technologies can possibly be used to maintain a low salinity in this emerging farming technique requirement for high transmembrane pressures 39 however could be the main drawback in this application owing to the high concentration polarization that most probably will happen on the membrane surfaces freshwater aquaculture may be more suitable for aquaculture owing to its low salinity thus low concentration polarization minimized yellow head virus and white spot baculovirus outbreak in tiger shrimp culture 40 freshwater aquaculture however require stricter effluent control to minimize the impacts of seawater intrusion on surrounding agricultural activities 40 total suspended solids intensive shrimp farming with controlled water exchange will contribute to the significant accumulation of flocculated or bio floc particles 41 these particles are normally composed of algae bacteria and zooplankton which serve as additional nutrition for cultured shrimps the proper control of the total suspended solids is important to ensure that well maintained biochemical oxygen demand bod level higher feed conversion ratios no blockages in the gill in cultured species higher oxygen availability in the culture system and the growth of harmful microorganisms are minimised 41 high level of total suspended solids can suppress the growth of beneficial algal while promoting the growth of harmful microorganisms microbial community in closed shrimp culture system will be dominated by bacterial community instead of beneficial algal community when total suspended solids are not well controlled 41 optimum level of phosphate and nitrate n should be maintained through proper control of the total suspended solid concentration which are derived from by feces and uneaten food ideally total suspended solid content in shrimp farming should fall within 25 80 mg l and productivity will decline above this limit 42 in a previously reported study total suspended solids in the studied shrimp ponds varied between 67 76 mg l and increased over time 42 this shows that there is a need to control the content of total suspended solid during shrimp farming activity in order to maintain high productivity a reduced total suspended solid content in shrimp farming effluent is important in ensuring a healthy ecosystem while making farming activity more sustainable 43 suspended solids in aquaculture however is a major concern that might greatly reduce the membrane lifespan and performance this can be explained by its pore plugging characteristics and cake layer formation tendency 44 aluminium sulphate and ferric chloride nevertheless have previously been added into the aquaculture wastewater to increase the suspended solid removal as high as 89 at a well controlled condition 45 ammonia and ammonium ammonia is one of the waste products from the metabolism of aquatic organisms and the decomposition of some organic matter by the bacteria in addition high amount of total ammonia has been observed for ponds over fed with large amount of feed 46 or when lower ammonia assimilation rate by phytoplankton which can be affected by phytoplankton cell proliferation that has been linked with nutrients input through feeding 47 depending on the water ph and temperature ammonia can be present in the pond water in unionised nh3 and ionised nh4 forms in general aquatic animals will excrete waste nitrogen primarily as un ionized ammonia 48 diffusion of un ionized ammonia across the gill is easier in comparison to the ammonium ion 49 this excretion process is affected by the equilibrium between external un ionized ammonia with blood ammonia level in aquatic animals when the concentration of un ionized ammonia in the water remains low the lost ammonia from the blood stream will encourage more dissociation of ammonium ion in the blood stream to form un ionized ammonia before they diffuse out of the blood stream into the surrounding water 50 diffusion of un ionized ammonia can be reversed from surrounding water into the blood stream when the concentration of un ionized ammonia in the surrounding water is higher than the blood stream a common problem in intensive shrimp farming a high content of ammonia can affect shrimp growth in which the maximum level of toxic ammonia for penaeid shrimp has been reported as 2 mg l of total ammonia in general 23 acute ammonia toxicology has been linked with its suppression of metabolic energy production in the central nervous system amination of α ketoglutarate intermediate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle will lead to reduced level of α ketoglutarate that can severely restrict the cyclic nature of metabolic pathway and its energy production 51 acute ammonia toxicology will lead to hyperactivity convulsion lethargy and eventually coma exposure of aquatic life to a long term of low concentration of un ionized ammonia on the other hand will disturb the osmoregulatory blood acidosis and reduced respiratory efficiency 52 this will eventually lead to reduced growth rate and higher susceptibility to infectious diseases other factors that contribute to the variation in ammonia toxicity level include salinity and shrimp size 53 overall the tolerances of shrimp towards unionised ammonia is considered low and the removal of ammonia from the rearing pond is greatly desired the accumulation of ammonia may reduce shrimp growth increase oxygen demand and reduce the survival rate of cultured shrimp 54 tolerance of crustaceans towards ammonia however have been reported to increase as the animals mature and grow sensitivity towards ammonia content reduced from larvae postlarvae juveniles and followed by adults 55 a closed culture has been suggested as part of the effort to reduce the concentration of ammonia in the effluent discharged 56 more data is still required to further verify the feasibility of the employment of a closed culture system in the shrimp farming industry so as to minimise the discharge of effluent containing ammonia to the environment the excessive content of the ammonia discharged from the aquaculture industries can also contribute to the occurrence of eutrophication which disrupts aquatic ecosystems 57 polysulfone membrane has been successfully employed to remove ammonia 66 and total ammonia 85 from aquaculture wastewater using low operating pressure of only 6 bar at ph 6 58 fouling resistances of polymeric membrane surfaces towards the ammonia and ammonium in aquaculture water nevertheless remain unclear and not well documented nitrate and nitrite content ammonia can undergo a nitrification process to form nitrate and nitrite with the help of microbes nitrosomonas and nitrobacter 59 which becomes a source of nitrogen for aquatic plants algae and bacteria accumulation of nitrite in the environment is rarely observed owing to the fast conversion of the nitrite which is an intermediate product in the oxidation of ammonia to nitrate 60 when the concentration of ammonia is relatively high possibly due to inactive phytoplankton or aquatic weeds under unfavourable conditions nitrite oxidation rate will be exceeded by ammonia oxidation rate which will lead to high accumulation of nitrite in the pond water accumulation of nitrite an intermediate product under anaerobic conditions in the water is also affected by denitrification process to produce nitrogen gas or nitrous oxide 61 denitrification process is normally observed in intensive aquaculture system at the bottom of the aquaculture pond owing to the high nitrogen loading in the forms of feed or feces produced 62 nitrite appeared to be toxic to marine shrimp despite nitrite is only weakly concentrated into the hemolymph and the presence of chloride ions in salt water was presumed to decrease the nitrite uptake through competitive exclusion as observed in certain fish species 63 toxicology of nitrite with hemocyanin however were not fully understood significant concentrations of nitrite may cause a decrease in the immune ability of aquaculture species for instance when litopenaeus vannamei is exposed to high concentration of nitrite it is more susceptible to vibrios infection 23 a kind of bacterial infection that causes poor growth anorexia inactivity reddish pleural borders of antennae and mortality 64 litopenaeus vannamei shows the highest tolerance to nitrite content in the water at various salinity percentages amongst all the species this means litopenaeus vannamei has the best survival rate and is favoured by farmers in different countries 65 safe nitrite level suggested during normal culture is 0 45 mg l while 96 h half maximal effective concentration ec50 and lethal concentration lc50 at 2 g l salinity for litopenaeus vannamei was determined to be 9 mg l 66 by comparison shrimp species overall will have higher tolerance towards nitrate content in cultured pond water from previous study nitrate concentration of up to 440 ppm has displayed negative effect towards the shrimp survival growth and biomass 67 nanofiltration membrane nf270 has been tested for the removal of nitrate and nitrite in various aquaculture water qualities that normally found in recirculating aquaculture systems 68 high transmembrane pressure as high as 19 bar was recorded during its application to retain nitrate and nitrite higher rejection was recorded for nitrate compared to nitrite owing to its higher stokes radius 0 129 nm and hydrated radius 0 335 nm calcium magnesium and sulfate content calcium carbonate is required in shrimp pond water to enhance the growth of phytoplankton and improve the conditions for microbial activity and benthic animals and thus a higher survival rate of shrimp culture 23 calcium ion is also important in osmo regulation blood clotting muscle contraction nerve transmission enzymatic activity and participates in hardening the exoskeleton in the molting process in crustaceans 69 most aquatic organisms can absorb calcium ions readily from their surroundings to sustain their own requirements however the optimal range of calcium carbonate for shrimp varies depending on shrimp size and species for instance the optimal range of calcium carbonate for black tiger shrimp farming has been reported as 80 mg l 24 magnesium ion on the other hand is important in lipid protein and carbohydrate metabolisms and serves as a cofactor in a large number of metabolic and enzymatic reactions 69 insufficient magnesium ion in shrimp farming potentially leads to the reduced growth and survival rate of the cultured shrimp 35 70 the addition of magnesium potassium and sodium ions in shrimp culture ponds is strongly recommended for shrimp reared at low salinity 70 according to a previous study a low concentration of magnesium ion 10 mg l can cause significant stress to shrimp respiration 70 the presence of sulphate ions in the culture water system is not desirable as it can deteriorate water quality the presence of sulphate ions has been closely linked to sulphide production 71 which is especially true in shrimp culture using saline water researchers have reported that areas with higher sulphide containing sediments showed significantly lower feed acceptance by the shrimp 72 this could be explained by the preference of shrimp cultures to stay away from toxic compounds when sulphate containing water contributes to the formation of sulphide sediments magnesium calcium and sulfate ions in the aquaculture water need to be well controlled at its optimal concentration using membrane filtration system this could be one of the most challenging issues for the application of membrane technology in aquaculture industry owing to their high tendency to form scaling on the membrane surfaces when proper operating condition is not practised 73 shrimp farm effluent standards and current practice of water management shrimp farm effluent standards have been proposed to serve as guidelines for farmers before discharge their pond effluent into the environment table 3 shows some of the effluent standards that have been developed for shrimp farming industry it is worth to note that however some of the countries have not implemented such effluent standards for their shrimp farming industry owing to the weak enforcement or restricted water treatment technology that might impact their economy negatively as this will require more investment in separation equipment wastewater control systems analytical instruments human capital development and effluent quality monitoring systems currently various water management methods have been implemented in aquaculture industries the most common and cheapest way of achieving this objective is through water exchange method in which the pond water consist of high content of total ammonia nitrogen will be discharged into the environment while receiving freshwater from the surrounding 75 this method will deteriorate the environment significantly reduction in the use of drug and chemical is another option to reduce the pollutant load in shrimp culture pond water application of drug and chemical in shrimp farming however remains a popular option in the shrimp farming water management due to its short term effectiveness and lower cost in comparison to other water control technology this method nevertheless can lead to accumulation of chemicals and drugs in the farmed shrimps and causing some food safety issues 2 reducing the stocking density in shrimp farming from 50 postlarvae m2 to a density between 30 40 postlarvae m2 also has been reported to be an effective way to reduce the water usage for about 93 in shrimp farming from 38000 to 2500 l per kg of shrimp produced 76 this method however will reduce the shrimp production significantly 4 membrane technology as a possible solution to be integrated into shrimp farming for water quality control membrane technology is an alternative solution for water management in shrimp farming in addition to the employment of ecological methods and biological or chemical substances the influent or effluent in shrimp farming requires close monitoring in order to boost production while preventing the environment from collapsing due to pollution or the concentration of certain nutrients in a cultured pond that can contribute to a harmful algal bloom 77 for instance massive dinoflagellate blooms red tides have been documented in shrimp culture ponds in different regions of the world and have contributed to severe economic loss 77 commonly aquaculture lands are abandoned after several years due to the excessive use of chemical or biological substances that cause irreversible environmental pollution for instance the waste substances that are discharged into the surrounding water will contribute to a higher chemical oxygen demand that lowers the oxygen level within the surrounding water 78 in the long term the aquaculture industry will face the core issue of inadequate lands ideal for the aquaculture industry making it unsustainable membrane technology can possibly be introduced into the aquaculture industry for pond water conditioning wastewater treatment before discharged into the ecosystem 79 and the recovery of useful nutrients for other applications major contaminants in aquaculture wastewater include ammonia as the main waste product due to the metabolism of organisms or unused supplements without any pre treatment the discharge of aquaculture wastewater into the ecosystem may elevate the ammonia or nitrogenous contents in the surrounding water this can contribute to the short term exposure of surrounding aquatic organisms such as fish to a high content of ammonia that will eventually lead to reduced reproductive capacity and growth 79 a the prospects of microfiltration membrane in shrimp farming microfiltration mf membrane possesses pore sizes ranging from 0 1 to 10 μm this allows the mf membranes to be easily cleaned using a back flushing method regular back flushing of mf membrane can prolong its lifespan and minimise replacement cost mf membrane has gained great interest in the food and beverage industry 80 pharmaceutical field in water treatment 81 desalination plants and so forth in water treatment mf membrane has been reported for the removal of virus 82 sludge 83 phosphorus 84 and more which suggests great potential for its integration in the water management system in shrimp farming despite this the use of mf processes as part of the water management strategy in shrimp farming is still not well documented today in fish farming however microfiltration modules were previously studied for their performance in six test culture systems for a duration of about 15 months 85 in that specific investigation researchers employed only low transmembrane pressure ranging from 0 3 to 0 7 bar and 0 03 0 05 bar for commercial capillary membrane modules zenon zw500 and eidos hf pp m6 respectively both membrane modules are having low pore sizes ranging from 0 04 to 0 9 μm such pore sizes are actually ideal for most of the aquaculture applications including shrimp farming as most of the pollutants are larger than this size range researchers introduced periodical back flushing and chemical cleaning for membrane module zenon zw500 when the membrane module was used continuously for 3 190 h 85 for membrane module eidos hf pp m6 however only chemical cleaning was conducted using detergent sodium hydroxide and citric acid solutions when there was a noticeable membrane flux reduction according to their investigations the retention of total suspended solids in all permeates were practically 100 they have reported higher flux reduction during the farming period owing to high loadings of total suspended solid content in the fish farming according to their findings similar microfiltration modules can be used to maintain the stability of biological water purification in addition to reducing the wastewater and residue loads such microfiltration modules undoubtedly can be suggested for shrimp farming application in view of the high economical values of shrimps and high effectiveness of the filtration system the prospects of ultrafiltration membrane in shrimp farming ultrafiltration uf membranes commonly have pore sizes that range from 1 to 100 nm 86 and require only low pressure during operation uf membranes can also be characterised in terms of molecular weight cut off values with respect to the solutes employed which mostly depend on the membrane manufacturers ultrafiltration processes have been extensively employed for various applications such as water treatment 87 the fractionation of skimmed milk 88 dye removal 89 and so forth in recent years ultrafiltration membranes have been further explored for their efficiency in virus removal 90 93 this has shed some light on the use of uf membranes as a mean of disease control in the shrimp farming industry due to their lower operating cost in comparison to nanofiltration nf or reverse osmosis ro processes the pore sizes of uf membranes are slightly smaller than the white spot syndrome virus a disease that had a big impact on shrimp farming industries in many countries the intact enveloped virions range from 210 to 380 nm in length and 70 167 nm in width 94 95 this virus can contribute to 100 cumulative mortality less than 10 days after the onset of symptoms 96 without any available treatments for the disease heavy water exchange in the shrimp farming industry has worsened this condition which probably increases the risk of disease transmission to neighbouring farms disease outbreak could be minimised or controlled however through proper water management in shrimp farms the feed water to the shrimp farming pond could undergo a uf process to screen out the pathogens before shrimp culturing similarly transmissions to neighbouring farms could be minimised if the pond water goes through uf processes before discharge the use of commercial uf membranes for this purpose is however restricted by their high bio fouling tendency in the water filtration processes the membranes are highly exposed to bacterial attacks especially when polymeric membranes are used polymeric uf membrane surfaces without anti bacterial properties are the potential sites for bio fouling phenomenon to occur due to the microbial release of extracellular polymeric substances eps this will contribute to the biofilm formations that deteriorate the uf membrane performance such as low water permeation low membrane lifespan low retention capability and high energy consumption high bio fouling tendency and virus penetration through the uf membranes have limited the use of uf membranes in the shrimp farming industry however the latest developments in anti bacterial uf membranes have emerged as a possible solution to overcoming this limitation 97 100 when researchers incorporated silver nanoparticles nag into the polymeric membrane the biofilm formation or the growth of bacteria on the membrane or in the solution surrounding the membrane was minimised 93 according to the previous work 93 nag incorporated into polysulfone ultrafiltration membranes nag psf exhibited antimicrobial properties towards a variety of bacteria including escherichia coli k12 pseudomonas mendocina kr1 and the ms2 bacteriophage fig 5 this phenomenon was linked to the release of silver ions they also verified that the removal of the virus using silver incorporated membrane was significantly improved this could make the anti bacterial uf membranes suitable for use in the shrimp farming industry in the near future the same work 93 addressed future challenges to be solved following their results the authors suggested future exploration for additional methods to incorporate nanoparticles onto the membrane surfaces rather than within the membrane matrices which aims to improve the membrane s anti bacterial effect incorporation of anti bacterial nanoparticles onto the membrane surfaces could be through the use of polyelectrolytes 101 plasma assisted coating 102 and so forth there are however some common problems that have been associated with the incorporation of nanoparticles into the polymeric membranes researchers 93 observed leaching or rapid depletion of the silver nanoparticles near the membrane surface leaching behaviour of the nanoparticles either from the membrane surface or permeation through the membrane is commonly observed during the filtration process 101 the invention of uf membranes with anti bacterial properties has possibly provided shrimp farming industry with a better solution for water management these membranes could be employed in the shrimp farming pond for disease and pollutant control the uf process is also attractive for shrimp farming as it involves lower pressure and operating costs in comparison to nf and ro further improvements of the membrane characteristics are still ongoing in studies in the hope of providing membranes with more stable performances the prospects of nanofiltration membrane in shrimp farming developments of nanofiltration processes began in the 1980s since then they have been employed in the removal of salt ions 103 104 dyes 89 105 humic acid 103 and other fractionation processes 106 the use of nanofiltration processes in the past few years has been fuelled by stringent standards set for potable water and discharged effluent from industries its use in the separation processes has also been encouraged by the low pressure and energy requirements when compared to the reverse osmosis process despite its wide use in separation and purification processes direct application of the nanofiltration process in shrimp culture is still not well documented this could be linked to the high implementation cost that would increase requirement for shrimp farming capital especially in southeast asian countries the operational cost of the nanofiltration process during shrimp farming could possibly reduce the requirement for large mangrove to pond ratio however which minimises the requirement for a large mangrove area for the rejuvenation of the ecosystem 107 and reduce the concentration of stressors during shrimp farming to minimise the outbreak of diseases this could minimise the dependency of the shrimp farming industry on natural mangrove areas research into the possibility of employing fabricated nanofiltration membrane to remove certain components such as ammonia has been reported recently 108 nanofiltration performance has been evaluated for its suitability in aquaculture research in terms of ammonium retention ability and solution flux at various trans membrane pressures and solution ph 56 researchers employed a synthetic ammonium water mixture as a model solution during the investigation this study 56 employed commercial polyamide based nanofiltration membranes which have relatively similar membrane resistances calculated based on pure water flux measurement using eq 2 and isoelectric points ranging from 3 to 4 during the ammonium retention study 2 j p t δ π μ r m r f r c p researchers successfully demonstrated a higher ammonium retention ability using negatively charged polyamide membranes at ph 7 fig 6 which is far from their respective isoelectric points 56 according to their work the retention abilities of the nanofiltration membranes were reduced when the electrochemical forces were surpassed by increased pressure forces the critical trans membrane pressure determined was about 16 bars for all of the nanofiltration membranes reverse osmosis membrane employed during their study however showed higher critical trans membrane pressure due to a lower diffusion area and diffusion coefficient their work has begun great progress in water management in aquaculture by employing nanofiltration membranes and the alteration of the membrane surface charge through the solution ph control controlling water ph for a large cultured pond is a challenging task however as it depends on the cultured species rate of metabolism food supplied and other chemical additives for pond water moderation an ideal separation process that solely depends on the membrane surface charge alteration through the water ph control is far from sufficient or realistic for practical application nonetheless this work has opened up the potential to integrate the nanofiltration process with fine tuning the water quality of shrimp culture ponds with or without recirculation to avoid devastating effect on ecosystems and to maintain a healthy environment that promotes shrimp growth the use of a water recirculation system is an initiative to minimise the mass destruction of mangrove areas in previously reported work 16 32 of the total mangrove area in thailand alone was destroyed to make way for shrimp aquaculture between 1979 and 1993 109 to make matters worse shrimp farming ponds can be abandoned after years of operation due to the accumulation of toxic materials and disease outbreaks this causes significant damage to coastal zones and economic development in many countries at the current stage strict governmental policies and enforcement are the only measures to protect the coastal regions in many countries which are important for increasing the sustainability of the shrimp farming industry 109 water recirculation systems could be used to overcome the issues associated with environmental pollution and its effectiveness could be further improved by adopting newly developed water separation technology such as a membrane filtration unit to control the water quality of aquaculture ponds 110 111 in similar work researchers tried to fabricate polyethersulfone nanofiltration membranes through the phase inversion method for ammonia nitrogen removal 108 they studied the effect of shear rate which was calculated using eq 3 for the membrane separation performances they employed a synthetic sodium chloride solution 0 01 m and spiegler kedem equation to estimate the ratio of solute radius to the membrane pore radius f η using eq 4 they also calculated the reflection coefficient using eq 5 which takes into consideration all the steric hindrance factors hf hd sf and sd and eqs 6 9 to relate the solute permeation to the shear rate used during the membrane casting process this work has revealed that at higher shear rates the reflection coefficients obtained were increased and contributed to better ammonia nitrogen removal but at an ammonia nitrogen concentration that is not well defined this has been explained by the higher effective separation layer of the membrane fabricated at higher shear rates which reduced the membrane pore radius fig 7 this work has provided valuable information to help alter the membrane retention ability for ammonia nitrogen and models that are suitable for membrane performance evaluation in aquaculture industry 3 s h e a r r a t e s 1 v e l o c

technology for wastewater control in shrimp farming membrane technology offers a possible solution to improving aquaculture pond water quality as part of efforts to minimise the mortality rate of the cultured stocks membrane technology can also possibly be used to reduce impact on the environment by reducing the contaminants in the discharged pond water due to the excessive use of biological and chemical products such as herbicides pesticides antibiotics salinity controlling agents 112 113 during shrimp farming activity pond water is frequently exchanged with the surrounding water in order to ensure a well maintained water quality the discharged pond water has been associated with several environmental issues such as eutrophication depletion of dissolved oxygen and siltation due to the high content of suspended solids and nutrients as high as 46 6 μm of ammonium 3 0 μm of phosphate 9 2 μm of nitrate 6 1 μm of nitrite etc 112 it worth noting that the discharged water will contain various concentrations of the nutrients depending on shrimp culture geographical locations or countries reverse osmosis membrane modules could be one of the good candidate for wastewater treatment application in aquaculture as these membranes can remove up to 97 of nitrogenous wastes 114 their application in marine shrimp farming however might not be encouraged as they can reduce the salinity of the pond water as high as 93 which might affect the osmoregulation of the cultured shrimps theoretically lowered or zero water exchange rates appear to be a better option for use in the aquaculture industry in view of their minimised damage towards the environment 115 this could be realised at the current stage due to the advances in water separation techniques such as membrane technology 79 116 however such approaches are less attractive to farmers from certain countries in view of the high implementation cost during farming processes reasons for limited studies of the application of membrane technology in shrimp farming membrane technology has been well established in various industries in the recent years because there are ample materials for selection and due to improvement in the filtration processes and membrane fabrication methods 117 118 for instance membrane technology has been successfully and widely employed for the production of potable water in industries 119 the employment of membrane technology for aquaculture water management is still far from being well established this could be explained by some of the core challenges that are still not fully overcome fig 8 most of the membrane separation processes use polymeric membranes due to their low cost and good pore control however polymeric membranes are easily exposed to bacterial attack 120 that reduces the membrane separation performance for prolonged periods recent studies in modifying polymeric membranes 120 121 and the search for new polymeric materials 122 have created the opportunity and potential to produce membranes with anti bacterial properties 97 123 this will remain one of the main objectives and challenges in membrane research in the near future membranes with anti bacterial properties are important especially for the shrimp farming industry in which bacteria growth is further encouraged by the presence of nutrients within the cultured pond water frequent replacement and cleaning of the membrane cartridges as a result of bacterial attacks during their application in shrimp farming activities is neither feasible nor desirable as it is too costly and time consuming frequent cleaning of the membranes in operation to improve the solution flux and separation performance also can generate a large quantity of undesired wastewater this will remain one of the most challenging issues in the application of membrane technology which is especially true for shrimp farming activity as the discharge of the wastewater into the surroundings can lead to a higher risk of contamination or disease outbreak this problem however can possibly be solved by i optimized membrane cleaning process and proper fouling control strategy to minimize the wastewater generated one of the effective fouling control strategies that has been suggested is through the production of micro bubbles diameter ranges from 10 to 50 micrometres by forcing the solution together with the air bubbles through a slit under high shear stress 124 from shrimp farming perspective this method can be useful in culture water purification as well as for pond aeration ii using biodegradable polymers from renewable resources 125 126 in the membrane fabrication this option can reduce the requirement for excessive cleaning of the membranes by making them disposable cost competitive while environmental friendly 127 128 this can be seen as a promising way from the shrimp farming perspective because the contamination of culture water due to the used membranes from previous crop cycles can be eliminated using new membranes in the filtration systems another drawback in employing membrane processes in aquaculture is the low surface wettability of the membrane employed polyethersulfone 118 polyvinylidene fluoride 129 and polysulfone 130 131 are the most common membranes employed due to their good mechanical strength and chemical resistance especially for aqueous based separations however these membranes have high surface hydrophobicity in common membrane with higher hydrophilicity is always preferable in aqueous based separation as it has been well associated with improved surface wettability and better anti fouling performance 132 134 this can further prolong the membrane lifespan and thus lower replacement cost membrane with higher surface wettability also has been verified to have higher water flux without losing its selectivity 135 in recent years efforts have been made to alter the membrane surface hydrophilicity through the deposition of polyelectrolytes in a layer by layer manner 104 136 uv grafting 103 118 blending with hydrophilic materials 137 and so forth these advances have contributed much to produce membranes with better hydrophilicity possibly more suited for application in the shrimp farming industry in the near future other factor that affect the membrane performance is the membrane surface charge density similarly membrane surface charge density is highly dependent on the selection of the membrane material from the shrimp farming perspective membrane surface charge density can be used to minimize the adsorption of pond water pollutants onto the membrane surface thus reducing the membrane surface fouling tendency the effect of membrane surface charge density however is expected to be affected by the pond water ph 138 the effect of membrane surface charge density due to ph variation of a shrimp farming pond is expected to play a minimal role in determining the membrane surface fouling in comparison to the effect of membrane surface wettability owing to the strict ph requirement during the culturing activity 139 high operating cost is another major consideration that has restricted use of the membrane filtration system 140 in the desalination as well as shrimp farming industry most membrane filtration processes are carried out at relatively high pressure in order to produce the desired permeate or throughput this is well explained by the low solution flux produced using membranes with dense separation layers or small pore sizes the dense separation layer or small pore size of the membrane employed can contribute to higher fouling or scaling tendency which makes the process more energy consuming 140 current research has focused on the production of low pressure membranes 141 that are comparable to some of the commercial membranes with relatively similar separation performance and throughput 104 such research is gaining more attention as it is a promising way to perform the separation processes at lower energy consumption and cost the employment of membrane filtration such as the reverse osmosis process in aquaculture water management is sometimes not practical as the retention of certain components needs to remain low in a previous study researchers reported the use of immersed hollow fibre microfiltration membrane with a mean pore size of 0 2 μm to supply seawater to semi closed systems and maintain their quality during a toxic event 142 shrimp farming is complicated by the requirement for precise control of the pond water quality one of the most important parameters is pond water salinity which has been linked with cultured species 143 use of the reverse osmosis process as a pre treatment for shrimp farming wastewater could reduce the release of nutrients into the ecosystem and possibly minimise the occurrence of eutrophication recycling or purification of the pond water during the culture of shrimp will require the use of membrane with high solute selectivity in order to ensure better removal of the undesired components in the pond water such as ammonia content or faeces while allowing the return of the desired components to the pond water such as salt ions and minerals the advancement of membrane research in recent years however has successfully produced membrane with high flux and improved solute selectivity 144 145 according to a previous study 145 researchers have successfully produced membranes from self assembly of zwitterion containing amphiphilic random copolymers such membranes have exhibited encouraging fouling resistance in protein solutions and oil emulsions applications the on going material research will soon be able to contribute to the tailored made membranes with specific solute selectivity to meet the strict requirements in the shrimp farming from the shrimp farming perspective membranes with high solute selectivity is crucial in ensuring that the pollutants in shrimp farming ponds such as ammonia ammonium total suspended solids phosphorus and sulphate to fall within the safe levels during the farming period while making sure that the pond water salinity mainly determined by the content of magnesium sodium and potassium ions is well maintained as it plays an important role in the osmoregulation of cultured species 31 membrane with tunable selectivity 146 in addition will be an added advantage for the integration of membrane technology into shrimp farming in which the water quality can be easily controlled by proper membrane material selection and process flow rate 5 application of ozone technology in shrimp farming in addition to the water management techniques discussed above ozone technology has been considered as another alternative for use in the shrimp farming industry previously ozone technology one of the advanced oxidation processes aop has been well employed in water treatment processes 147 149 ozone technology can be used to promote the micro flocculation of organic matter that improves the removal of suspended solids from the water filtration system ozone technology can be employed to mitigate membrane fouling in treating surface water 150 previously ozone treatment has successfully reduced the total heterotrophic and vibrio species bacterial loading in finfish cultured water 151 a feasibility study employing ozone technology for large shrimp farming ponds has not yet been well documented which could be linked to a inaccessible or inconsistent data this could be due to inexperienced operators with no consistent data recording practices or the absence of recording devices b high implementation costs that encourage shrimp farmers to use conventional water management methods c low effectiveness against the white spot syndrome virus 152 d low effectiveness for large scaled farming as the disinfection takes place mainly within the ozone contactor which normally lasts for a short period of time 59 ozone technology had been considered an effective method in water treatment applications for years before it was studied for its potential application in shrimp farming industry ozone is considered an effective oxidant that readily deactivates pathogens it leaves no toxic residual in water streams due to its volatile and short lived characteristics 152 ozone technology has contributed significantly to the fight against taura syndrome virus tsv in ecuador shrimp farms 152 shrimp production was not affected significantly by tsv when the ozone was in contact with the pond raw water supplies the success of the use of ozone technology against the water borne diseases in shrimp farming was overpowered when white spot syndrome virus invaded the shrimp farming industry 152 ozone has been successfully used to deactivate the wssv in less than 10 min at a concentration of 0 5 mg l 152 but its effectiveness on a larger scale is not well documented the tolerance of each shrimp species towards the ozone concentration chronic and acute effects is still not well evaluated 153 ozone technology is commonly integrated into the recirculating aquaculture system ras together with bio filtration units to improve the water quality 59 recently the use of ozone in the aquaculture industry has raised some concerns about the nitrifying bio filter bacteria due to the formation of ozone produced oxidants opo surprisingly researchers found that the presence of opo does not deteriorate the nitrification process in bio filter 59 on the contrary the use of ozone in moderate quantity was sufficient to further promote the nitrification process by reducing the organic load which was important in order to control the growth of competing heterotrophic bacteria in the bio filter the results obtained are quite promising and pave the way for the integration of ozone in ras for large scaled shrimp farming activities in coming years nevertheless direct use of ozone technology in the aquaculture industry still requires special care so as to avoid physical damage and physiological stress to stock animals 6 integrated recirculating aquaculture systems the productivity of marine fisheries has been declining over the years which encouraged exploration of intensive aquaculture to meet the global marine protein requirement ras or closed aquaculture systems have thus been introduced to overcome some of the environmental issues that are associated with the discharge of aquaculture effluents 154 as well as land scarcity and shortage of fresh water supply several advantages of using a recirculation system have been discussed in general by researchers 56 155 156 and are summarised in table 4 the microbial community occurring naturally within the ras was responsible for nitrogen remineralisation nonetheless these ras are not spared from organic loading during the production cycle near to harvesting the water turbidity within the ras will increase along with the ammonia and nitrite no2 content which will threaten the survival of shrimp 154 a nitrification process relying on the microbial activity to convert nh4 to no2 followed by no3 will take up about 22 of the dissolved oxygen in ras 43 this process is important in ras to reduce the content of nh3 and no2 to a safe level for the survival of cultured shrimps ras has received great attention in the development of aquaculture in recent years however it is complicated by its high requirements for the water quality which is important to sustain the cultured species in order for ras to be successfully integrated into the aquaculture industry other water management techniques need to be considered and evaluated as part of the ras component these water management techniques will include screening processes using membrane technology 85 ozone technology 59 and other disinfection processes through the use of bio filters and chemicals 157 recently researchers studied the performance of ras using membrane filtration system coupled with catalytic ozonation 150 fig 9 shows the process flow diagram of the ras employed an activated carbon filter was employed in the ras after the membrane filtration unit to remove the residual ozone which is considered harmful to most of the aquatic organisms aquaculture wastewater from a culture farm was employed according to them 150 total ammonia nitrogen was reduced to 0 1 mg l after operating for 1 h in the presence of ozone eq 10 the nitrite formed was then removed and decomposed when ozone was present in the system eq 11 the removal of total ammonia nitrogen and the decomposition of nitrite by ozonation has been proposed as follows 10 nh3 3o3 h no2 h2o 3o2 11 no2 o3 no3 o2 according to them 150 the recovery ratio of the aquaculture seawater could be as high as 95 8 this is something encouraging and promising for the potential use of such a coupling ozonation membrane filtration ras in shrimp farming the suitability of the ras for integration in shrimp farming in consideration of other controllable parameters such as water temperature and ph needs further verification through experimental data in order to obtain cultured shrimp with high survival and growth rates table 5 shows some comparisons between two different recirculating aquaculture systems that have been explored membrane technology used in this recirculating aquaculture system used only microfiltration membranes and has the lowest energy consumption per litre of processed pond water membrane technology used in this recirculating aquaculture system can process large volume of pond water yet having high removal capability towards cod bod and phosphate 158 this system will be sufficient to be used for marine shrimp culture owing to its capability to maintain high total dissolve solids tds in the system while rejecting others pollutant these information however can be used for general comparison only and requires more supporting data in the near future owing to the following reasons a aquaculture water sample used in the studies mimicked fish aquaculture pond 158 159 b no sufficient data on real large scale recirculating aquaculture systems is available which including recirculating aquaculture system integrated with membrane bioreactor 160 c specifications of equipment used are not clearly specified and make the cost estimation not possible 159 d volume of pond water that can be processed is different for both systems which will lead to variation in the estimated performance by evaluating several recirculating aquaculture systems that have been studied one recirculating aquaculture system has been proposed as shown in fig 10 this system consists of components as previously suggested such as ozonation system and membrane filtration modules 150 in addition to an anaerobic membrane bioreactor system that can be utilized to produce biogas for electricity and clean water prior to the membrane filtration unit a pre treatment stage to remove big particulates is required in order to lengthen the membrane module lifespan and improve the water quality 150 pre treatment stage using sand filtration is normally suggested owing to its effectiveness in the removal of big particulates and having a relatively low cost 161 selection of the membrane module combinations amongst microfiltration ultrafiltration nanofiltration and reverse osmosis however will highly depend on the requirement of the cultured species the reasons for using anaerobic membrane bioreactor was due to its excellent performance in nitrogen and carbon removal while having good energy recovery 159 162 163 this proposed system can minimize the effluent discharge while providing purified water of high quality 111 7 conclusion shrimp farming productivity has been affected by many factors such as cultured species food conversion rate and water quality and disease control most of the time water quality plays the most important role in determining the shrimp survival rate and productivity the productivity of shrimp farming has been related to water parameters or content such as water ph temperature salinity dissolved oxygen level total suspended solids ammonia ammonium nitrate nitrite potassium calcium carbonate phosphorus sulphur and organic acids some of these parameters will have a positive effect on shrimp survival and growth rates when they are in optimal conditions such as potassium ions and calcium carbonate however some of the parameters could be lethal to shrimp when they are not in optimal conditions such as dissolved oxygen level ammonia content organic acids culture pond water quality varies across farms due to the differences in farming strategy geographical location incoming water source feed strategy and so forth variations in water parameters have contributed to different shrimp growth and survival rates the presence of certain compounds in excess during shrimp farming have been associated with stressed conditions in cultured shrimps which makes the shrimp more susceptible to disease the effluent discharge from shrimp farming activity which normally contains a high loading of contaminants also poses a great challenge to the environmental protection proper water management in shrimp farming is thus important to ensure a healthy culture environment and to make farming activity more sustainable several water management techniques have been evaluated and adopted in the shrimp farming industry on either laboratory scale or a commercial scale membrane filtration processes serve as a great tool for integration into the water management system in shrimp farming due to their unique sieving effect and solute removal mechanism several problems have restricted the implementation of membrane technology in aquaculture industry however such as a high fouling rate high implementation and replacement cost low anti bacterial properties and low solute selectivity capability recent studies have progressed well towards the realisation of membrane with high surface wettability which can greatly reduce the membrane fouling tendency and extend the membrane lifespan researchers have successfully developed membrane with improved antibacterial properties through the incorporation of nanoparticles membrane s ability to remove toxic compound like ammonia has also been studied and modelled by researchers the shrimp farming industry may benefited from the continuous advancement of desalination technology as part of its water management strategy ozone technology also appears to be a good candidate for integration into shrimp farming due to its effectiveness towards promoting a nitrification process that can reduce the organic loading in the farms the ozonation process has demonstrated outstanding prevention against outbreaks of disease in shrimp farms excluding white spot syndrome virus the ozonation process should preferably be integrated into shrimp culture with other filtration processes such as membrane filtration to minimise the physiological stress of the stocked culture this has contributed to the development of integrated ras in which several water management techniques can be combined into a system to improve the water quality in aquaculture farms ras offers great benefits for shrimp farming industry such as high biosecurity minimum effluent discharge and flexible geographical

14544,the growth of the human population shrinking seafood supply and polluted seawater are amongst the reasons that have encouraged a more stringent practice of water management in the aquaculture industry the productivity of cultured shrimps is greatly restricted by limited access to clean seawater for aquaculture areas however which lack leads to severe disease outbreaks and reduced shrimp survival rates water management has thus become the core issue for increasing shrimp production by reducing the contamination from fresh water intake fresh water usage and aquaculture wastewater discharge the objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of setting up an integrated recirculating aquaculture system using the membrane technology which possibly utilizes microfiltration ultrafiltration nanofiltration or reverse osmosis modules to improve the quality of aquaculture water while minimize the wastewater discharge and increase the water reuse feasibility of the integrated recirculating aquaculture system will be evaluated based on the effectiveness of improvement on the aquaculture water quality and limitations of the current membrane technologies this study is highly

article will discuss the importance of water management in shrimp farming industry and their current stage of research and development in addition this review article will discuss the water quality requirements based on the key parameters in shrimp farming in order to increase the shrimp survival rates and prevent massive disease outbreaks in the culture ponds lastly this review article will evaluate the possibility of integrating membrane technology into shrimp farming industry based on their separation performance and their previous usages in aquaculture industry by analysing designs of recirculating aquaculture systems that have been studied by other researchers an integrated recirculating aquaculture system will be proposed at the end of this review article to allow researchers to conduct data collection and investigation in the near future 2 importance of water management in shrimp farming industry continuous development of desalination and water treatment technology has encouraged its employment in aquaculture water pre treatment and reclamation stages over 50 of the global shrimp supply for human consumption has been obtained in shrimp farming activity since 2006 1 fig 1 shows the world aquaculture production for crustaceans from 2006 to 2015 the world aquaculture production for crustaceans has increased to around 68 from year 2006 2015 fig 2 shows the fishery product exportation amount from top five exporting countries from 2013 to 2015 china appears to be the leading country in both aquaculture production and exportation of fishery commodities based on a research work that was previously conducted every single tonne of shrimp aquaculture production can be translated into 5345 7157 m3 of effluent discharge 2 based on the world aquaculture production for crustaceans effluent discharge from the aquaculture industry around the world can be close to 3 74 1010 m3 with the assumption that no recirculating aquaculture system is used for water treatment the importance of the shrimp industry to global economic growth can be clearly seen through shrimp exportation 4 and related research activities according to data obtained from indexed databases there was significant growth in shrimp aquaculture related publications from 1969 to 2016 fig 3 in addition to being a driving force from the economic perspective continual advances in science and technology have also contributed to the involvement of various countries in shrimp related studies united states thailand and india are the top countries that actively playing a role in shrimp research and development fig 4 the global supply of shrimp products and its development is still restricted by poor water management however which could possibly contribute to a massive disease outbreak 5 as in finfish aquaculture the food supplied to shrimp aquaculture systems will generate a large amount of organic matter and nutrients mostly phosphorus and nitrogen as metabolic waste 6 these compounds will compete with aquatic animals for the dissolved oxygen in water this will contribute to the asphyxiation of aquatic lives and thus a high mortality rate in aquaculture industries without a proper and efficient water management system critical water management system by integrating various water treatment technologies is important in providing a healthy environment for shrimp farming pond water quality is crucial in the prevention of disease outbreaks caused by pathogens such as viruses fungi or bacteria shrimp pond water management plays an important role in preventing massive disease outbreak and major production losses by increasing the survival rate of cultured shrimp which is especially significant when using the intensive shrimp farming method disinfectants are normally added to the water during the shrimp farming as part of viral control 7 the employment of disinfectants in japan china and thailand all have resulted in failures 153 the presence of diseases in the shrimp farming industry can have disastrous effects on shrimp production and economic development 9 the situation can be worsened by the spread of diseases to neighbouring ponds through the discharge of pond water into the environment efforts have thus been made to minimise disease spread such as a minimising water exchange during the culture period 10 water exchange is a common practice used to obtain fresh water with reduced pollutants 11 but water exchange increases the risk of introducing infectious diseases to farms in the absence of proper water filtration systems b micro screening with 100 300 μm meshes to prevent the viral carrier organisms and tissue fragments entering the pond system such a prevention method is similarly not so effective owing to the fact that most of the water borne viruses are having sizes less than 100 μm 3 water quality requirements in shrimp farming and their possible effects to the membranes information on the effects of water quality parameters on shrimp farming industry is greatly required in order to have a better design of the water management system that suit this application 12 close monitoring of shrimp pond water quality makes the control and prediction of the possible occurrences of undesired conditions during cultivation possible 13 this will also minimise the environmental damage causes by frequent water exchange 14 and wastewater discharge and termination of the production process through proper water quality control 15 table 1 shows water exchange requirement in the culture of various marine shrimp species a pond water ph an effective implementation of membrane modules in a recirculating aquaculture system will require an evaluation of the water ph owing to the fact that water ph can alter the membrane surface charges and their effectiveness in solute retention 21 22 optimal water ph for most marine shrimp growth has been reported to be within the range of 6 0 9 0 23 but varies depending on the adaptation of shrimp and shrimp species for instance ph 7 5 8 5 has been reported as optimal ph for black tiger shrimp with a daily fluctuation not more than 0 3 24 but fluctuation of the pond water ph is unavoidable due to the different behaviour of the living organisms during different day periods 25 an extremely low level of ph at 3 7 has been reported to be the 96 h lc50 median lethal concentration for tiger shrimp penaeus monodon 25 low ph levels of 4 9 6 4 have been reported to retard the growth of penaeus monodon 25 pond water ph has been well related to its toxicity effect towards the aquatic organisms owing to its ability to change the concentration of either ionized or un ionized ammonia ions according to a reported work 26 ionized ammonia species nh4 has been determined to be less toxic to aquatic life when compared to unionized ammonia molecules nh3 because ionized ammonia species is less permeable in the cell membranes of aquatic life the species of ammonia present in the aqueous solution is highly dependent on the chemical equilibrium which is affected by the solution ph and can be represented by chemical equation eq 1 according to them low ph will reduce the formation of unionized ammonia that lead to a less toxic environment to the aquatic life at higher ph environment higher hydroxide ion concentration will shift the chemical equilibrium towards the formation of higher concentration of unionized ammonia thus forming a more toxic environment to the aquatic life 1 n h 3 g n h 2 o l n h 3 n h 2 o a q n h 4 o h n 1 h 2 o l conversely ph 9 0 9 5 has been reported to reduce the total haemocyte count thc and the phenoloxidase po activity of the freshwater prawn macrobrachium rosenbergii and its resistance against lactococcus garvieae for macrobrachium rosenbergii reared at ph 4 6 5 2 low ph range and ph 8 8 9 5 high ph range it was more susceptible to lactococcus garvieae compared to those reared at normal ph ph 7 5 7 7 25 this has been explained by the increased phagocytic activity and clearance efficiency of the macrobrachium rosenbergii against lactococcus garvieae optimum ph for the culture of litopenaeus vannamei however was reported to be at ph 8 2 owing to the finding that the shrimps reared at ph 6 5 and 10 1 exhibited low phagocytic activities and clearance efficiency to vibrio alginolyticus 25 based on these optimal ph condition ph 6 0 9 0 most of the common membrane materials such as polyethersulfone cellulose triacetate and polysulfone will be negatively charged 27 28 during their normal application in recirculating aquaculture system under these circumstances these membrane should exhibit higher rejection towards the negatively charged particulates anions and organic matters 29 that present in the pond water owing to the donnan effect polymeric membranes with low ph tolerances can be considered for this application with no significant losses in retention performances 30 pond water salinity a constant salinity profile is highly preferable for the growth of shrimp during farming activity 23 because it plays an important role in the osmoregulation of the cultured species 31 constant salinity profile in recirculating aquaculture system can possibly be achieved through proper selection of the membrane type that removes only unwanted particulates microfiltration and ultrafiltration membranes can be considered for this purpose which can return most of the salt ions back into the aquaculture system to maintain the desired salinity profile 32 the suitability of pond water salinity will depend on the adaptation of the shrimp and varies between species 33 and development stages refer to table 2 34 while low salinity also has been reported 35 different species of shrimp will have different iso osmotic points between hemolymph with seawater depending on the physiological relationship between salinity and metabolism 36 most of the penaeid shrimps however are euryhaline shrimps that can regulate the osmolality of body fluids to adapt a wide range of salinities 37 salinity of pond water in addition has been linked with the concentration of dissolved oxygen 36 this has been explained by lower diffusivity of oxygen molecules in water with higher salinity lower dissolved oxygen content thus led to a lower metabolism of cultured shrimps in response to lower oxygen consumption which were verified with lower shrimp growth rates 36 according to the reported work lower shrimp growth rates at higher water salinities also have been explained by higher infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis ihhn virus infections 36 as most white shrimp litopenaeus vannamei farming has been restricted by the expensive coastal aquaculture land access to clean or pollution free seawater and the emergence of the viral diseases shrimp production at extremely low salinities has been introduced 35 research has demonstrated a shrimp survival rate of 76 1 at 210 days with an average individual weight of 11 72 g using freshwater with 0 ppt salinity 35 undeniably shrimp farming using water at low salinity appears a better alternative so as to minimise dependency on seawater while possibly preventing major disease outbreak caused by polluted seawater recent development in the nanofiltration composite membranes having high salt selectivity 38 together with reverse osmosis modules and other desalination technologies can possibly be used to maintain a low salinity in this emerging farming technique requirement for high transmembrane pressures 39 however could be the main drawback in this application owing to the high concentration polarization that most probably will happen on the membrane surfaces freshwater aquaculture may be more suitable for aquaculture owing to its low salinity thus low concentration polarization minimized yellow head virus and white spot baculovirus outbreak in tiger shrimp culture 40 freshwater aquaculture however require stricter effluent control to minimize the impacts of seawater intrusion on surrounding agricultural activities 40 total suspended solids intensive shrimp farming with controlled water exchange will contribute to the significant accumulation of flocculated or bio floc particles 41 these particles are normally composed of algae bacteria and zooplankton which serve as additional nutrition for cultured shrimps the proper control of the total suspended solids is important to ensure that well maintained biochemical oxygen demand bod level higher feed conversion ratios no blockages in the gill in cultured species higher oxygen availability in the culture system and the growth of harmful microorganisms are minimised 41 high level of total suspended solids can suppress the growth of beneficial algal while promoting the growth of harmful microorganisms microbial community in closed shrimp culture system will be dominated by bacterial community instead of beneficial algal community when total suspended solids are not well controlled 41 optimum level of phosphate and nitrate n should be maintained through proper control of the total suspended solid concentration which are derived from by feces and uneaten food ideally total suspended solid content in shrimp farming should fall within 25 80 mg l and productivity will decline above this limit 42 in a previously reported study total suspended solids in the studied shrimp ponds varied between 67 76 mg l and increased over time 42 this shows that there is a need to control the content of total suspended solid during shrimp farming activity in order to maintain high productivity a reduced total suspended solid content in shrimp farming effluent is important in ensuring a healthy ecosystem while making farming activity more sustainable 43 suspended solids in aquaculture however is a major concern that might greatly reduce the membrane lifespan and performance this can be explained by its pore plugging characteristics and cake layer formation tendency 44 aluminium sulphate and ferric chloride nevertheless have previously been added into the aquaculture wastewater to increase the suspended solid removal as high as 89 at a well controlled condition 45 ammonia and ammonium ammonia is one of the waste products from the metabolism of aquatic organisms and the decomposition of some organic matter by the bacteria in addition high amount of total ammonia has been observed for ponds over fed with large amount of feed 46 or when lower ammonia assimilation rate by phytoplankton which can be affected by phytoplankton cell proliferation that has been linked with nutrients input through feeding 47 depending on the water ph and temperature ammonia can be present in the pond water in unionised nh3 and ionised nh4 forms in general aquatic animals will excrete waste nitrogen primarily as un ionized ammonia 48 diffusion of un ionized ammonia across the gill is easier in comparison to the ammonium ion 49 this excretion process is affected by the equilibrium between external un ionized ammonia with blood ammonia level in aquatic animals when the concentration of un ionized ammonia in the water remains low the lost ammonia from the blood stream will encourage more dissociation of ammonium ion in the blood stream to form un ionized ammonia before they diffuse out of the blood stream into the surrounding water 50 diffusion of un ionized ammonia can be reversed from surrounding water into the blood stream when the concentration of un ionized ammonia in the surrounding water is higher than the blood stream a common problem in intensive shrimp farming a high content of ammonia can affect shrimp growth in which the maximum level of toxic ammonia for penaeid shrimp has been reported as 2 mg l of total ammonia in general 23 acute ammonia toxicology has been linked with its suppression of metabolic energy production in the central nervous system amination of α ketoglutarate intermediate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle will lead to reduced level of α ketoglutarate that can severely restrict the cyclic nature of metabolic pathway and its energy production 51 acute ammonia toxicology will lead to hyperactivity convulsion lethargy and eventually coma exposure of aquatic life to a long term of low concentration of un ionized ammonia on the other hand will disturb the osmoregulatory blood acidosis and reduced respiratory efficiency 52 this will eventually lead to reduced growth rate and higher susceptibility to infectious diseases other factors that contribute to the variation in ammonia toxicity level include salinity and shrimp size 53 overall the tolerances of shrimp towards unionised ammonia is considered low and the removal of ammonia from the rearing pond is greatly desired the accumulation of ammonia may reduce shrimp growth increase oxygen demand and reduce the survival rate of cultured shrimp 54 tolerance of crustaceans towards ammonia however have been reported to increase as the animals mature and grow sensitivity towards ammonia content reduced from larvae postlarvae juveniles and followed by adults 55 a closed culture has been suggested as part of the effort to reduce the concentration of ammonia in the effluent discharged 56 more data is still required to further verify the feasibility of the employment of a closed culture system in the shrimp farming industry so as to minimise the discharge of effluent containing ammonia to the environment the excessive content of the ammonia discharged from the aquaculture industries can also contribute to the occurrence of eutrophication which disrupts aquatic ecosystems 57 polysulfone membrane has been successfully employed to remove ammonia 66 and total ammonia 85 from aquaculture wastewater using low operating pressure of only 6 bar at ph 6 58 fouling resistances of polymeric membrane surfaces towards the ammonia and ammonium in aquaculture water nevertheless remain unclear and not well documented nitrate and nitrite content ammonia can undergo a nitrification process to form nitrate and nitrite with the help of microbes nitrosomonas and nitrobacter 59 which becomes a source of nitrogen for aquatic plants algae and bacteria accumulation of nitrite in the environment is rarely observed owing to the fast conversion of the nitrite which is an intermediate product in the oxidation of ammonia to nitrate 60 when the concentration of ammonia is relatively high possibly due to inactive phytoplankton or aquatic weeds under unfavourable conditions nitrite oxidation rate will be exceeded by ammonia oxidation rate which will lead to high accumulation of nitrite in the pond water accumulation of nitrite an intermediate product under anaerobic conditions in the water is also affected by denitrification process to produce nitrogen gas or nitrous oxide 61 denitrification process is normally observed in intensive aquaculture system at the bottom of the aquaculture pond owing to the high nitrogen loading in the forms of feed or feces produced 62 nitrite appeared to be toxic to marine shrimp despite nitrite is only weakly concentrated into the hemolymph and the presence of chloride ions in salt water was presumed to decrease the nitrite uptake through competitive exclusion as observed in certain fish species 63 toxicology of nitrite with hemocyanin however were not fully understood significant concentrations of nitrite may cause a decrease in the immune ability of aquaculture species for instance when litopenaeus vannamei is exposed to high concentration of nitrite it is more susceptible to vibrios infection 23 a kind of bacterial infection that causes poor growth anorexia inactivity reddish pleural borders of antennae and mortality 64 litopenaeus vannamei shows the highest tolerance to nitrite content in the water at various salinity percentages amongst all the species this means litopenaeus vannamei has the best survival rate and is favoured by farmers in different countries 65 safe nitrite level suggested during normal culture is 0 45 mg l while 96 h half maximal effective concentration ec50 and lethal concentration lc50 at 2 g l salinity for litopenaeus vannamei was determined to be 9 mg l 66 by comparison shrimp species overall will have higher tolerance towards nitrate content in cultured pond water from previous study nitrate concentration of up to 440 ppm has displayed negative effect towards the shrimp survival growth and biomass 67 nanofiltration membrane nf270 has been tested for the removal of nitrate and nitrite in various aquaculture water qualities that normally found in recirculating aquaculture systems 68 high transmembrane pressure as high as 19 bar was recorded during its application to retain nitrate and nitrite higher rejection was recorded for nitrate compared to nitrite owing to its higher stokes radius 0 129 nm and hydrated radius 0 335 nm calcium magnesium and sulfate content calcium carbonate is required in shrimp pond water to enhance the growth of phytoplankton and improve the conditions for microbial activity and benthic animals and thus a higher survival rate of shrimp culture 23 calcium ion is also important in osmo regulation blood clotting muscle contraction nerve transmission enzymatic activity and participates in hardening the exoskeleton in the molting process in crustaceans 69 most aquatic organisms can absorb calcium ions readily from their surroundings to sustain their own requirements however the optimal range of calcium carbonate for shrimp varies depending on shrimp size and species for instance the optimal range of calcium carbonate for black tiger shrimp farming has been reported as 80 mg l 24 magnesium ion on the other hand is important in lipid protein and carbohydrate metabolisms and serves as a cofactor in a large number of metabolic and enzymatic reactions 69 insufficient magnesium ion in shrimp farming potentially leads to the reduced growth and survival rate of the cultured shrimp 35 70 the addition of magnesium potassium and sodium ions in shrimp culture ponds is strongly recommended for shrimp reared at low salinity 70 according to a previous study a low concentration of magnesium ion 10 mg l can cause significant stress to shrimp respiration 70 the presence of sulphate ions in the culture water system is not desirable as it can deteriorate water quality the presence of sulphate ions has been closely linked to sulphide production 71 which is especially true in shrimp culture using saline water researchers have reported that areas with higher sulphide containing sediments showed significantly lower feed acceptance by the shrimp 72 this could be explained by the preference of shrimp cultures to stay away from toxic compounds when sulphate containing water contributes to the formation of sulphide sediments magnesium calcium and sulfate ions in the aquaculture water need to be well controlled at its optimal concentration using membrane filtration system this could be one of the most challenging issues for the application of membrane technology in aquaculture industry owing to their high tendency to form scaling on the membrane surfaces when proper operating condition is not practised 73 shrimp farm effluent standards and current practice of water management shrimp farm effluent standards have been proposed to serve as guidelines for farmers before discharge their pond effluent into the environment table 3 shows some of the effluent standards that have been developed for shrimp farming industry it is worth to note that however some of the countries have not implemented such effluent standards for their shrimp farming industry owing to the weak enforcement or restricted water treatment technology that might impact their economy negatively as this will require more investment in separation equipment wastewater control systems analytical instruments human capital development and effluent quality monitoring systems currently various water management methods have been implemented in aquaculture industries the most common and cheapest way of achieving this objective is through water exchange method in which the pond water consist of high content of total ammonia nitrogen will be discharged into the environment while receiving freshwater from the surrounding 75 this method will deteriorate the environment significantly reduction in the use of drug and chemical is another option to reduce the pollutant load in shrimp culture pond water application of drug and chemical in shrimp farming however remains a popular option in the shrimp farming water management due to its short term effectiveness and lower cost in comparison to other water control technology this method nevertheless can lead to accumulation of chemicals and drugs in the farmed shrimps and causing some food safety issues 2 reducing the stocking density in shrimp farming from 50 postlarvae m2 to a density between 30 40 postlarvae m2 also has been reported to be an effective way to reduce the water usage for about 93 in shrimp farming from 38000 to 2500 l per kg of shrimp produced 76 this method however will reduce the shrimp production significantly 4 membrane technology as a possible solution to be integrated into shrimp farming for water quality control membrane technology is an alternative solution for water management in shrimp farming in addition to the employment of ecological methods and biological or chemical substances the influent or effluent in shrimp farming requires close monitoring in order to boost production while preventing the environment from collapsing due to pollution or the concentration of certain nutrients in a cultured pond that can contribute to a harmful algal bloom 77 for instance massive dinoflagellate blooms red tides have been documented in shrimp culture ponds in different regions of the world and have contributed to severe economic loss 77 commonly aquaculture lands are abandoned after several years due to the excessive use of chemical or biological substances that cause irreversible environmental pollution for instance the waste substances that are discharged into the surrounding water will contribute to a higher chemical oxygen demand that lowers the oxygen level within the surrounding water 78 in the long term the aquaculture industry will face the core issue of inadequate lands ideal for the aquaculture industry making it unsustainable membrane technology can possibly be introduced into the aquaculture industry for pond water conditioning wastewater treatment before discharged into the ecosystem 79 and the recovery of useful nutrients for other applications major contaminants in aquaculture wastewater include ammonia as the main waste product due to the metabolism of organisms or unused supplements without any pre treatment the discharge of aquaculture wastewater into the ecosystem may elevate the ammonia or nitrogenous contents in the surrounding water this can contribute to the short term exposure of surrounding aquatic organisms such as fish to a high content of ammonia that will eventually lead to reduced reproductive capacity and growth 79 a the prospects of microfiltration membrane in shrimp farming microfiltration mf membrane possesses pore sizes ranging from 0 1 to 10 μm this allows the mf membranes to be easily cleaned using a back flushing method regular back flushing of mf membrane can prolong its lifespan and minimise replacement cost mf membrane has gained great interest in the food and beverage industry 80 pharmaceutical field in water treatment 81 desalination plants and so forth in water treatment mf membrane has been reported for the removal of virus 82 sludge 83 phosphorus 84 and more which suggests great potential for its integration in the water management system in shrimp farming despite this the use of mf processes as part of the water management strategy in shrimp farming is still not well documented today in fish farming however microfiltration modules were previously studied for their performance in six test culture systems for a duration of about 15 months 85 in that specific investigation researchers employed only low transmembrane pressure ranging from 0 3 to 0 7 bar and 0 03 0 05 bar for commercial capillary membrane modules zenon zw500 and eidos hf pp m6 respectively both membrane modules are having low pore sizes ranging from 0 04 to 0 9 μm such pore sizes are actually ideal for most of the aquaculture applications including shrimp farming as most of the pollutants are larger than this size range researchers introduced periodical back flushing and chemical cleaning for membrane module zenon zw500 when the membrane module was used continuously for 3 190 h 85 for membrane module eidos hf pp m6 however only chemical cleaning was conducted using detergent sodium hydroxide and citric acid solutions when there was a noticeable membrane flux reduction according to their investigations the retention of total suspended solids in all permeates were practically 100 they have reported higher flux reduction during the farming period owing to high loadings of total suspended solid content in the fish farming according to their findings similar microfiltration modules can be used to maintain the stability of biological water purification in addition to reducing the wastewater and residue loads such microfiltration modules undoubtedly can be suggested for shrimp farming application in view of the high economical values of shrimps and high effectiveness of the filtration system the prospects of ultrafiltration membrane in shrimp farming ultrafiltration uf membranes commonly have pore sizes that range from 1 to 100 nm 86 and require only low pressure during operation uf membranes can also be characterised in terms of molecular weight cut off values with respect to the solutes employed which mostly depend on the membrane manufacturers ultrafiltration processes have been extensively employed for various applications such as water treatment 87 the fractionation of skimmed milk 88 dye removal 89 and so forth in recent years ultrafiltration membranes have been further explored for their efficiency in virus removal 90 93 this has shed some light on the use of uf membranes as a mean of disease control in the shrimp farming industry due to their lower operating cost in comparison to nanofiltration nf or reverse osmosis ro processes the pore sizes of uf membranes are slightly smaller than the white spot syndrome virus a disease that had a big impact on shrimp farming industries in many countries the intact enveloped virions range from 210 to 380 nm in length and 70 167 nm in width 94 95 this virus can contribute to 100 cumulative mortality less than 10 days after the onset of symptoms 96 without any available treatments for the disease heavy water exchange in the shrimp farming industry has worsened this condition which probably increases the risk of disease transmission to neighbouring farms disease outbreak could be minimised or controlled however through proper water management in shrimp farms the feed water to the shrimp farming pond could undergo a uf process to screen out the pathogens before shrimp culturing similarly transmissions to neighbouring farms could be minimised if the pond water goes through uf processes before discharge the use of commercial uf membranes for this purpose is however restricted by their high bio fouling tendency in the water filtration processes the membranes are highly exposed to bacterial attacks especially when polymeric membranes are used polymeric uf membrane surfaces without anti bacterial properties are the potential sites for bio fouling phenomenon to occur due to the microbial release of extracellular polymeric substances eps this will contribute to the biofilm formations that deteriorate the uf membrane performance such as low water permeation low membrane lifespan low retention capability and high energy consumption high bio fouling tendency and virus penetration through the uf membranes have limited the use of uf membranes in the shrimp farming industry however the latest developments in anti bacterial uf membranes have emerged as a possible solution to overcoming this limitation 97 100 when researchers incorporated silver nanoparticles nag into the polymeric membrane the biofilm formation or the growth of bacteria on the membrane or in the solution surrounding the membrane was minimised 93 according to the previous work 93 nag incorporated into polysulfone ultrafiltration membranes nag psf exhibited antimicrobial properties towards a variety of bacteria including escherichia coli k12 pseudomonas mendocina kr1 and the ms2 bacteriophage fig 5 this phenomenon was linked to the release of silver ions they also verified that the removal of the virus using silver incorporated membrane was significantly improved this could make the anti bacterial uf membranes suitable for use in the shrimp farming industry in the near future the same work 93 addressed future challenges to be solved following their results the authors suggested future exploration for additional methods to incorporate nanoparticles onto the membrane surfaces rather than within the membrane matrices which aims to improve the membrane s anti bacterial effect incorporation of anti bacterial nanoparticles onto the membrane surfaces could be through the use of polyelectrolytes 101 plasma assisted coating 102 and so forth there are however some common problems that have been associated with the incorporation of nanoparticles into the polymeric membranes researchers 93 observed leaching or rapid depletion of the silver nanoparticles near the membrane surface leaching behaviour of the nanoparticles either from the membrane surface or permeation through the membrane is commonly observed during the filtration process 101 the invention of uf membranes with anti bacterial properties has possibly provided shrimp farming industry with a better solution for water management these membranes could be employed in the shrimp farming pond for disease and pollutant control the uf process is also attractive for shrimp farming as it involves lower pressure and operating costs in comparison to nf and ro further improvements of the membrane characteristics are still ongoing in studies in the hope of providing membranes with more stable performances the prospects of nanofiltration membrane in shrimp farming developments of nanofiltration processes began in the 1980s since then they have been employed in the removal of salt ions 103 104 dyes 89 105 humic acid 103 and other fractionation processes 106 the use of nanofiltration processes in the past few years has been fuelled by stringent standards set for potable water and discharged effluent from industries its use in the separation processes has also been encouraged by the low pressure and energy requirements when compared to the reverse osmosis process despite its wide use in separation and purification processes direct application of the nanofiltration process in shrimp culture is still not well documented this could be linked to the high implementation cost that would increase requirement for shrimp farming capital especially in southeast asian countries the operational cost of the nanofiltration process during shrimp farming could possibly reduce the requirement for large mangrove to pond ratio however which minimises the requirement for a large mangrove area for the rejuvenation of the ecosystem 107 and reduce the concentration of stressors during shrimp farming to minimise the outbreak of diseases this could minimise the dependency of the shrimp farming industry on natural mangrove areas research into the possibility of employing fabricated nanofiltration membrane to remove certain components such as ammonia has been reported recently 108 nanofiltration performance has been evaluated for its suitability in aquaculture research in terms of ammonium retention ability and solution flux at various trans membrane pressures and solution ph 56 researchers employed a synthetic ammonium water mixture as a model solution during the investigation this study 56 employed commercial polyamide based nanofiltration membranes which have relatively similar membrane resistances calculated based on pure water flux measurement using eq 2 and isoelectric points ranging from 3 to 4 during the ammonium retention study 2 j p t δ π μ r m r f r c p researchers successfully demonstrated a higher ammonium retention ability using negatively charged polyamide membranes at ph 7 fig 6 which is far from their respective isoelectric points 56 according to their work the retention abilities of the nanofiltration membranes were reduced when the electrochemical forces were surpassed by increased pressure forces the critical trans membrane pressure determined was about 16 bars for all of the nanofiltration membranes reverse osmosis membrane employed during their study however showed higher critical trans membrane pressure due to a lower diffusion area and diffusion coefficient their work has begun great progress in water management in aquaculture by employing nanofiltration membranes and the alteration of the membrane surface charge through the solution ph control controlling water ph for a large cultured pond is a challenging task however as it depends on the cultured species rate of metabolism food supplied and other chemical additives for pond water moderation an ideal separation process that solely depends on the membrane surface charge alteration through the water ph control is far from sufficient or realistic for practical application nonetheless this work has opened up the potential to integrate the nanofiltration process with fine tuning the water quality of shrimp culture ponds with or without recirculation to avoid devastating effect on ecosystems and to maintain a healthy environment that promotes shrimp growth the use of a water recirculation system is an initiative to minimise the mass destruction of mangrove areas in previously reported work 16 32 of the total mangrove area in thailand alone was destroyed to make way for shrimp aquaculture between 1979 and 1993 109 to make matters worse shrimp farming ponds can be abandoned after years of operation due to the accumulation of toxic materials and disease outbreaks this causes significant damage to coastal zones and economic development in many countries at the current stage strict governmental policies and enforcement are the only measures to protect the coastal regions in many countries which are important for increasing the sustainability of the shrimp farming industry 109 water recirculation systems could be used to overcome the issues associated with environmental pollution and its effectiveness could be further improved by adopting newly developed water separation technology such as a membrane filtration unit to control the water quality of aquaculture ponds 110 111 in similar work researchers tried to fabricate polyethersulfone nanofiltration membranes through the phase inversion method for ammonia nitrogen removal 108 they studied the effect of shear rate which was calculated using eq 3 for the membrane separation performances they employed a synthetic sodium chloride solution 0 01 m and spiegler kedem equation to estimate the ratio of solute radius to the membrane pore radius f η using eq 4 they also calculated the reflection coefficient using eq 5 which takes into consideration all the steric hindrance factors hf hd sf and sd and eqs 6 9 to relate the solute permeation to the shear rate used during the membrane casting process this work has revealed that at higher shear rates the reflection coefficients obtained were increased and contributed to better ammonia nitrogen removal but at an ammonia nitrogen concentration that is not well defined this has been explained by the higher effective separation layer of the membrane fabricated at higher shear rates which reduced the membrane pore radius fig 7 this work has provided valuable information to help alter the membrane retention ability for ammonia nitrogen and models that are suitable for membrane performance evaluation in aquaculture industry 3 s h e a r r a t e s 1 v e l o c

technology for wastewater control in shrimp farming membrane technology offers a possible solution to improving aquaculture pond water quality as part of efforts to minimise the mortality rate of the cultured stocks membrane technology can also possibly be used to reduce impact on the environment by reducing the contaminants in the discharged pond water due to the excessive use of biological and chemical products such as herbicides pesticides antibiotics salinity controlling agents 112 113 during shrimp farming activity pond water is frequently exchanged with the surrounding water in order to ensure a well maintained water quality the discharged pond water has been associated with several environmental issues such as eutrophication depletion of dissolved oxygen and siltation due to the high content of suspended solids and nutrients as high as 46 6 μm of ammonium 3 0 μm of phosphate 9 2 μm of nitrate 6 1 μm of nitrite etc 112 it worth noting that the discharged water will contain various concentrations of the nutrients depending on shrimp culture geographical locations or countries reverse osmosis membrane modules could be one of the good candidate for wastewater treatment application in aquaculture as these membranes can remove up to 97 of nitrogenous wastes 114 their application in marine shrimp farming however might not be encouraged as they can reduce the salinity of the pond water as high as 93 which might affect the osmoregulation of the cultured shrimps theoretically lowered or zero water exchange rates appear to be a better option for use in the aquaculture industry in view of their minimised damage towards the environment 115 this could be realised at the current stage due to the advances in water separation techniques such as membrane technology 79 116 however such approaches are less attractive to farmers from certain countries in view of the high implementation cost during farming processes reasons for limited studies of the application of membrane technology in shrimp farming membrane technology has been well established in various industries in the recent years because there are ample materials for selection and due to improvement in the filtration processes and membrane fabrication methods 117 118 for instance membrane technology has been successfully and widely employed for the production of potable water in industries 119 the employment of membrane technology for aquaculture water management is still far from being well established this could be explained by some of the core challenges that are still not fully overcome fig 8 most of the membrane separation processes use polymeric membranes due to their low cost and good pore control however polymeric membranes are easily exposed to bacterial attack 120 that reduces the membrane separation performance for prolonged periods recent studies in modifying polymeric membranes 120 121 and the search for new polymeric materials 122 have created the opportunity and potential to produce membranes with anti bacterial properties 97 123 this will remain one of the main objectives and challenges in membrane research in the near future membranes with anti bacterial properties are important especially for the shrimp farming industry in which bacteria growth is further encouraged by the presence of nutrients within the cultured pond water frequent replacement and cleaning of the membrane cartridges as a result of bacterial attacks during their application in shrimp farming activities is neither feasible nor desirable as it is too costly and time consuming frequent cleaning of the membranes in operation to improve the solution flux and separation performance also can generate a large quantity of undesired wastewater this will remain one of the most challenging issues in the application of membrane technology which is especially true for shrimp farming activity as the discharge of the wastewater into the surroundings can lead to a higher risk of contamination or disease outbreak this problem however can possibly be solved by i optimized membrane cleaning process and proper fouling control strategy to minimize the wastewater generated one of the effective fouling control strategies that has been suggested is through the production of micro bubbles diameter ranges from 10 to 50 micrometres by forcing the solution together with the air bubbles through a slit under high shear stress 124 from shrimp farming perspective this method can be useful in culture water purification as well as for pond aeration ii using biodegradable polymers from renewable resources 125 126 in the membrane fabrication this option can reduce the requirement for excessive cleaning of the membranes by making them disposable cost competitive while environmental friendly 127 128 this can be seen as a promising way from the shrimp farming perspective because the contamination of culture water due to the used membranes from previous crop cycles can be eliminated using new membranes in the filtration systems another drawback in employing membrane processes in aquaculture is the low surface wettability of the membrane employed polyethersulfone 118 polyvinylidene fluoride 129 and polysulfone 130 131 are the most common membranes employed due to their good mechanical strength and chemical resistance especially for aqueous based separations however these membranes have high surface hydrophobicity in common membrane with higher hydrophilicity is always preferable in aqueous based separation as it has been well associated with improved surface wettability and better anti fouling performance 132 134 this can further prolong the membrane lifespan and thus lower replacement cost membrane with higher surface wettability also has been verified to have higher water flux without losing its selectivity 135 in recent years efforts have been made to alter the membrane surface hydrophilicity through the deposition of polyelectrolytes in a layer by layer manner 104 136 uv grafting 103 118 blending with hydrophilic materials 137 and so forth these advances have contributed much to produce membranes with better hydrophilicity possibly more suited for application in the shrimp farming industry in the near future other factor that affect the membrane performance is the membrane surface charge density similarly membrane surface charge density is highly dependent on the selection of the membrane material from the shrimp farming perspective membrane surface charge density can be used to minimize the adsorption of pond water pollutants onto the membrane surface thus reducing the membrane surface fouling tendency the effect of membrane surface charge density however is expected to be affected by the pond water ph 138 the effect of membrane surface charge density due to ph variation of a shrimp farming pond is expected to play a minimal role in determining the membrane surface fouling in comparison to the effect of membrane surface wettability owing to the strict ph requirement during the culturing activity 139 high operating cost is another major consideration that has restricted use of the membrane filtration system 140 in the desalination as well as shrimp farming industry most membrane filtration processes are carried out at relatively high pressure in order to produce the desired permeate or throughput this is well explained by the low solution flux produced using membranes with dense separation layers or small pore sizes the dense separation layer or small pore size of the membrane employed can contribute to higher fouling or scaling tendency which makes the process more energy consuming 140 current research has focused on the production of low pressure membranes 141 that are comparable to some of the commercial membranes with relatively similar separation performance and throughput 104 such research is gaining more attention as it is a promising way to perform the separation processes at lower energy consumption and cost the employment of membrane filtration such as the reverse osmosis process in aquaculture water management is sometimes not practical as the retention of certain components needs to remain low in a previous study researchers reported the use of immersed hollow fibre microfiltration membrane with a mean pore size of 0 2 μm to supply seawater to semi closed systems and maintain their quality during a toxic event 142 shrimp farming is complicated by the requirement for precise control of the pond water quality one of the most important parameters is pond water salinity which has been linked with cultured species 143 use of the reverse osmosis process as a pre treatment for shrimp farming wastewater could reduce the release of nutrients into the ecosystem and possibly minimise the occurrence of eutrophication recycling or purification of the pond water during the culture of shrimp will require the use of membrane with high solute selectivity in order to ensure better removal of the undesired components in the pond water such as ammonia content or faeces while allowing the return of the desired components to the pond water such as salt ions and minerals the advancement of membrane research in recent years however has successfully produced membrane with high flux and improved solute selectivity 144 145 according to a previous study 145 researchers have successfully produced membranes from self assembly of zwitterion containing amphiphilic random copolymers such membranes have exhibited encouraging fouling resistance in protein solutions and oil emulsions applications the on going material research will soon be able to contribute to the tailored made membranes with specific solute selectivity to meet the strict requirements in the shrimp farming from the shrimp farming perspective membranes with high solute selectivity is crucial in ensuring that the pollutants in shrimp farming ponds such as ammonia ammonium total suspended solids phosphorus and sulphate to fall within the safe levels during the farming period while making sure that the pond water salinity mainly determined by the content of magnesium sodium and potassium ions is well maintained as it plays an important role in the osmoregulation of cultured species 31 membrane with tunable selectivity 146 in addition will be an added advantage for the integration of membrane technology into shrimp farming in which the water quality can be easily controlled by proper membrane material selection and process flow rate 5 application of ozone technology in shrimp farming in addition to the water management techniques discussed above ozone technology has been considered as another alternative for use in the shrimp farming industry previously ozone technology one of the advanced oxidation processes aop has been well employed in water treatment processes 147 149 ozone technology can be used to promote the micro flocculation of organic matter that improves the removal of suspended solids from the water filtration system ozone technology can be employed to mitigate membrane fouling in treating surface water 150 previously ozone treatment has successfully reduced the total heterotrophic and vibrio species bacterial loading in finfish cultured water 151 a feasibility study employing ozone technology for large shrimp farming ponds has not yet been well documented which could be linked to a inaccessible or inconsistent data this could be due to inexperienced operators with no consistent data recording practices or the absence of recording devices b high implementation costs that encourage shrimp farmers to use conventional water management methods c low effectiveness against the white spot syndrome virus 152 d low effectiveness for large scaled farming as the disinfection takes place mainly within the ozone contactor which normally lasts for a short period of time 59 ozone technology had been considered an effective method in water treatment applications for years before it was studied for its potential application in shrimp farming industry ozone is considered an effective oxidant that readily deactivates pathogens it leaves no toxic residual in water streams due to its volatile and short lived characteristics 152 ozone technology has contributed significantly to the fight against taura syndrome virus tsv in ecuador shrimp farms 152 shrimp production was not affected significantly by tsv when the ozone was in contact with the pond raw water supplies the success of the use of ozone technology against the water borne diseases in shrimp farming was overpowered when white spot syndrome virus invaded the shrimp farming industry 152 ozone has been successfully used to deactivate the wssv in less than 10 min at a concentration of 0 5 mg l 152 but its effectiveness on a larger scale is not well documented the tolerance of each shrimp species towards the ozone concentration chronic and acute effects is still not well evaluated 153 ozone technology is commonly integrated into the recirculating aquaculture system ras together with bio filtration units to improve the water quality 59 recently the use of ozone in the aquaculture industry has raised some concerns about the nitrifying bio filter bacteria due to the formation of ozone produced oxidants opo surprisingly researchers found that the presence of opo does not deteriorate the nitrification process in bio filter 59 on the contrary the use of ozone in moderate quantity was sufficient to further promote the nitrification process by reducing the organic load which was important in order to control the growth of competing heterotrophic bacteria in the bio filter the results obtained are quite promising and pave the way for the integration of ozone in ras for large scaled shrimp farming activities in coming years nevertheless direct use of ozone technology in the aquaculture industry still requires special care so as to avoid physical damage and physiological stress to stock animals 6 integrated recirculating aquaculture systems the productivity of marine fisheries has been declining over the years which encouraged exploration of intensive aquaculture to meet the global marine protein requirement ras or closed aquaculture systems have thus been introduced to overcome some of the environmental issues that are associated with the discharge of aquaculture effluents 154 as well as land scarcity and shortage of fresh water supply several advantages of using a recirculation system have been discussed in general by researchers 56 155 156 and are summarised in table 4 the microbial community occurring naturally within the ras was responsible for nitrogen remineralisation nonetheless these ras are not spared from organic loading during the production cycle near to harvesting the water turbidity within the ras will increase along with the ammonia and nitrite no2 content which will threaten the survival of shrimp 154 a nitrification process relying on the microbial activity to convert nh4 to no2 followed by no3 will take up about 22 of the dissolved oxygen in ras 43 this process is important in ras to reduce the content of nh3 and no2 to a safe level for the survival of cultured shrimps ras has received great attention in the development of aquaculture in recent years however it is complicated by its high requirements for the water quality which is important to sustain the cultured species in order for ras to be successfully integrated into the aquaculture industry other water management techniques need to be considered and evaluated as part of the ras component these water management techniques will include screening processes using membrane technology 85 ozone technology 59 and other disinfection processes through the use of bio filters and chemicals 157 recently researchers studied the performance of ras using membrane filtration system coupled with catalytic ozonation 150 fig 9 shows the process flow diagram of the ras employed an activated carbon filter was employed in the ras after the membrane filtration unit to remove the residual ozone which is considered harmful to most of the aquatic organisms aquaculture wastewater from a culture farm was employed according to them 150 total ammonia nitrogen was reduced to 0 1 mg l after operating for 1 h in the presence of ozone eq 10 the nitrite formed was then removed and decomposed when ozone was present in the system eq 11 the removal of total ammonia nitrogen and the decomposition of nitrite by ozonation has been proposed as follows 10 nh3 3o3 h no2 h2o 3o2 11 no2 o3 no3 o2 according to them 150 the recovery ratio of the aquaculture seawater could be as high as 95 8 this is something encouraging and promising for the potential use of such a coupling ozonation membrane filtration ras in shrimp farming the suitability of the ras for integration in shrimp farming in consideration of other controllable parameters such as water temperature and ph needs further verification through experimental data in order to obtain cultured shrimp with high survival and growth rates table 5 shows some comparisons between two different recirculating aquaculture systems that have been explored membrane technology used in this recirculating aquaculture system used only microfiltration membranes and has the lowest energy consumption per litre of processed pond water membrane technology used in this recirculating aquaculture system can process large volume of pond water yet having high removal capability towards cod bod and phosphate 158 this system will be sufficient to be used for marine shrimp culture owing to its capability to maintain high total dissolve solids tds in the system while rejecting others pollutant these information however can be used for general comparison only and requires more supporting data in the near future owing to the following reasons a aquaculture water sample used in the studies mimicked fish aquaculture pond 158 159 b no sufficient data on real large scale recirculating aquaculture systems is available which including recirculating aquaculture system integrated with membrane bioreactor 160 c specifications of equipment used are not clearly specified and make the cost estimation not possible 159 d volume of pond water that can be processed is different for both systems which will lead to variation in the estimated performance by evaluating several recirculating aquaculture systems that have been studied one recirculating aquaculture system has been proposed as shown in fig 10 this system consists of components as previously suggested such as ozonation system and membrane filtration modules 150 in addition to an anaerobic membrane bioreactor system that can be utilized to produce biogas for electricity and clean water prior to the membrane filtration unit a pre treatment stage to remove big particulates is required in order to lengthen the membrane module lifespan and improve the water quality 150 pre treatment stage using sand filtration is normally suggested owing to its effectiveness in the removal of big particulates and having a relatively low cost 161 selection of the membrane module combinations amongst microfiltration ultrafiltration nanofiltration and reverse osmosis however will highly depend on the requirement of the cultured species the reasons for using anaerobic membrane bioreactor was due to its excellent performance in nitrogen and carbon removal while having good energy recovery 159 162 163 this proposed system can minimize the effluent discharge while providing purified water of high quality 111 7 conclusion shrimp farming productivity has been affected by many factors such as cultured species food conversion rate and water quality and disease control most of the time water quality plays the most important role in determining the shrimp survival rate and productivity the productivity of shrimp farming has been related to water parameters or content such as water ph temperature salinity dissolved oxygen level total suspended solids ammonia ammonium nitrate nitrite potassium calcium carbonate phosphorus sulphur and organic acids some of these parameters will have a positive effect on shrimp survival and growth rates when they are in optimal conditions such as potassium ions and calcium carbonate however some of the parameters could be lethal to shrimp when they are not in optimal conditions such as dissolved oxygen level ammonia content organic acids culture pond water quality varies across farms due to the differences in farming strategy geographical location incoming water source feed strategy and so forth variations in water parameters have contributed to different shrimp growth and survival rates the presence of certain compounds in excess during shrimp farming have been associated with stressed conditions in cultured shrimps which makes the shrimp more susceptible to disease the effluent discharge from shrimp farming activity which normally contains a high loading of contaminants also poses a great challenge to the environmental protection proper water management in shrimp farming is thus important to ensure a healthy culture environment and to make farming activity more sustainable several water management techniques have been evaluated and adopted in the shrimp farming industry on either laboratory scale or a commercial scale membrane filtration processes serve as a great tool for integration into the water management system in shrimp farming due to their unique sieving effect and solute removal mechanism several problems have restricted the implementation of membrane technology in aquaculture industry however such as a high fouling rate high implementation and replacement cost low anti bacterial properties and low solute selectivity capability recent studies have progressed well towards the realisation of membrane with high surface wettability which can greatly reduce the membrane fouling tendency and extend the membrane lifespan researchers have successfully developed membrane with improved antibacterial properties through the incorporation of nanoparticles membrane s ability to remove toxic compound like ammonia has also been studied and modelled by researchers the shrimp farming industry may benefited from the continuous advancement of desalination technology as part of its water management strategy ozone technology also appears to be a good candidate for integration into shrimp farming due to its effectiveness towards promoting a nitrification process that can reduce the organic loading in the farms the ozonation process has demonstrated outstanding prevention against outbreaks of disease in shrimp farms excluding white spot syndrome virus the ozonation process should preferably be integrated into shrimp culture with other filtration processes such as membrane filtration to minimise the physiological stress of the stocked culture this has contributed to the development of integrated ras in which several water management techniques can be combined into a system to improve the water quality in aquaculture farms ras offers great benefits for shrimp farming industry such as high biosecurity minimum effluent discharge and flexible geographical
