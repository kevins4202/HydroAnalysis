23570,this work showcases the development and results of a model predictive controller mpc for a marine active heave compensation ahc system the system utilizes a common hydraulic 4 way 3 position proportional valve where the hysteresis dead band and non linear properties have been overcome to directly control a radial piston motor in the experimental test setup the mpc controller with a set point prediction algorithm is used to actuate the unloaded hydraulic test system and the results are compared to a tuned proportional integral derivative pid controller operating the same experimental setup the mpc controller is found to track a variety of test cases and references while outperforming the tuned pid controller for all experiments additionally a matlab simulink model of the experimental setup is created and validated within the simulator a load is then applied to the winch to test how the mpc and pid performance compare under loaded operating conditions based on the results of these tests simulations of an mpc controller running in parallel with a proportional integral pi controller are carried out for both the unloaded and loaded scenarios for the conditions tested in this research the resulting simulations suggest that the mpc pi controller is able to decouple up to 99 6 of the transmitted motion keywords active heave compensation winch control control systems model predictive control hydraulic systems 1 introduction considerable work has been done in the development of active heave compensation ahc systems for marine operations woodacre et al 2015 motion decoupling between for example a submerged remotely operated vehicle rov and its host ship can greatly reduce the tether loads and improve the safety of operators one of the first active heave systems was designed by southerland in 1970 southerland 1970 using a spring loaded tether attached from a crane boom on one ship to the deck of a second ship for position feedback as the tether pulled in and out it moved a hydraulic proportional valve which adjusted the load thereby maintaining a constant height from the deck this relatively simple mechanical feedback system has since been replaced with computer control control algorithms in an active heave system can be as simple as basic pi control as was used by gu et al 2013 for a hoisting rig or using a model based control system as used by yang et al 2008 to decouple an rov tether management system korde 1998 used accelerometers to create a state feedback system actuating a vibration absorber to reduce heave motion in a drill string riser other researchers have applied non linear control systems with disturbance observers do and pan 2008 or applied observers to estimate tether dynamics as part of the control scheme baddour and raman nair 2002 recent work by quan et al 2016 has gone further by combining models of tether dynamics a combined feed forward and pid controller and a passive heave compensator all within a single system in any control system corrections for the inherent lag perhaps introduced by the actuator or through slow communication between the inertial measurement unit imu and the control system must be made to try to achieve optimum control performance a system by kyllingstad kyllingstad 2012 for example applied transfer function filters to correct for time and phase lag in their overall system alternatively kuchler et al 2011 used heave prediction algorithms to predict vessel heave motion based on previous measurements and then applied a control action based on these predicted motions built upon a similar linear drill string model as used by korde 1998 hatleskog and dunnigan 2007 derived a linear transfer function model for an active passive hybrid system using feedfoward control on displacement as opposed to korde who used acceleration which attempts to correct for system phase lag in the 2007 work by hatleskog and dunnigan 2007 it is briefly mentioned that a predictive controller may be helpful in creating an ahc system that approaches 100 effectiveness in heave motion decoupling reasoning is not given as to how prediction may improve performance nevertheless it is possible that a predictive controller could be useful in systems where a significant but consistent and known time lag exists between heave measurement and actual motion prediction could also be used to partially correct for a large phase lag within the controller structure hastlekog and dunnigan go on to say that heave motion of a vessel is essentially unpredictable with a high probability of significant predictive error halliday et al 2006 in 2006 published work providing a method for using fast fourier transforms fft to accurately predict wave motion within approximately 10 up to 10 s into the future and up to 50 m away from the point of measurement although halliday et al intended to use short term wave prediction to increase efficiency of wave energy collectors their work is easily adaptable to predicting short term ship motion using imu data at a conference in 2008 neupert et al 2008 presented work to this effect where they used heave motion prediction as part of the control methodology for an ahc crane their approach used a linearized model of the crane dynamics along with the pole placement control method to set load position neupert et al 2008 perform simulations showing that their controller can track a step input to within 3 cm with a ship heave motion of approximately 0 5 m in the follow up work to neupert et al 2008 kuchler et al 2011 reported that the energy in the load could be reduced by 83 for their nonpredictive controller while energy in the load could be reduced by 98 2 for their predictive controller showing an improvement when using heave prediction in their experimental system kuchler et al 2011 report a delay of approximately 0 7 s between sensor measurements and actuator response it is possible that the inability of their controller to completely decouple load from heave motion is caused by the prediction algorithm error when trying to predict 0 7 s into the future coupling the inherent system phase lag with additional time delay can lead to significant system delays in the phase diagram which cannot be easily compensated for to combat inherent system lag and to emulate a linear response ahc systems often employ specialized and expensive hydraulic swash plate pumps motors and servo valves rexrothboschgroup 2015 it is possible for these ahc systems to be in the hydraulic open loop or closed loop circuit configuration both hydraulic configurations have their advantages and disadvantages rexrothboschgroup 2015 however open loop system are common and flexible in their operation woodacre et al 2015 the current paper introduces a possible option to help correct for large phase lag using model predictive control mpc while preserving system flexibility with a simple 4 way 3 position proportional valve on a hydraulic open loop circuit a review of ahc literature shows that an mpc controller in combination with wave prediction has not yet been used for the purposes of controlling an ahc system mpc relies on a system model to determine optimal controller output by solving a quadratic optimization problem additionally mpc is capable of utilizing knowledge of future set points in order to react to these changes before they happen a process called previewing in the current work an mpc controller with wave prediction is used to actuate an unloaded hydraulic test setup and the results are compared to a pid controller operating the same experimental setup where pid was used as comparison as it is common in industry and serves a suitable benchmark for controller development a corresponding computer simulator of the test setup is then developed to compare the performance of mpc and pid control when a simulated load is applied section 2 outlines the hydraulic hardware used within this paper and how the limitations of a common hydraulic valve were overcome section 3 explains the control methodology used both experimentally and in simulation while section 4 shows the baseline heave motion reference data used in this research along with three additional test cases corresponding to different at sea conditions section 5 then compares the mpc controller to a pid controller for each test case while section 6 examines the robustness of mpc control to errors in model identification section 7 compares the performance of mpc and pid controllers on the experimental setup as well as on a matlab simulation of the experimental system without an applied load finally section 8 predicts how the experimental system would respond if a load were applied to the winch and a new mpc pi controller is developed and tested within the simulation environment 2 testbed hardware fig 1 shows a schematic of the open loop hydraulic ahc testbed used in this work an eaton pvm141er load sensing pump provides flow to the danfoss pvg 120 4 way 3 position proportional valve this valve is controlled via a voltage signal which opens the valve directing flow to and from the black bruin bb4 800 hydraulic motor proportional valves such as the danfoss pvg 120 used in this work have a hysteresis which is caused by flow forces acting against the spool residual magnetism of the armature and the inertia of the spool vickers incorporated 1999 to reduce this hysteresis a 50 hz sinusoidal dither signal was superimposed on the valve s control signal having a peak voltage v p k of 0 3 v this dither value was selected because it proved to be most effective at reducing the hysteresis over the range of frequencies and amplitudes tested woodacre 2015 the two graphs shown in fig 2 plot the angular velocity of the hydraulic motor as a function of the control voltage signal supplied to the valve for clarity only one direction of the motor s rotation is displayed as the control voltage to the valve is swept through the operational range the lefthand plot shows the system response without any added dither while the righthand side figure shows the system with the added 50 hz 0 3 v p k dither superimposed on top of the commanded control signal from fig 2 the dither effectively reduces the valve s hysteresis while allowing the spool to travel resulting in an angular velocity increase from an average value of 4 20 rps in the no dither case to a value of 4 85 rps in the dither case a 15 increase in the angular velocity additionally the proportional valve has two major non linear properties which are corrected for in this work deadband and non linear gain the deadband is a range of control voltages from 5 37 v to 7 12 v in which the valve remains closed below 5 37 v the valve opens in one direction and above 7 12 v the valve opens in the other direction physically the deadband is a range of spool positions within the valve where fluid flow is blocked from travelling from the pump to the valve outputs to avoid this deadband an offset is added to the valve control voltage in order to skip the voltages corresponding to the deadband thus as far as the controller is concerned the deadband does not exist fig 3 shows the resulting system angular velocity response in revolutions per second rps as a function of control voltage after the deadband has been corrected the valve s non linear gain is demonstrated in this figure by the deviation between the experimentally measured system response and the linear transfer function tf response this tf response is derived from the following tf 1 ω r p s v 26 6167 s 23 78 where ω is the angular velocity in rps and v is the control voltage this tf was identified from experimental step response data collected in the linear region of fig 3 between 0 68 v and 0 68 v to linearize the system response outside the 0 68 v and 0 68 v range a custom algorithm was implemented to modify the valve control voltage signal as illustrated in the following example assume that the intention is to apply a control voltage of 2v to the valve this control voltage labeled a in fig 3 corresponds to an actual motor velocity of 4 5 rps as represented by point b it is desired however that the system react according to the linear tf response in fig 3 with an angular velocity corresponding to b instead of b following the arrows across to point c and then down through point d a new control voltage of 1v is generated which is then sent to the valve instead of the original control voltage of 2v the addition of dither and the implementation of the deadband and non linear gain corrections allow for improved control and a more deterministic system response when all three of these modifiers are used on the common proportional valve the valve begins to emulate more sophisticated and expensive servo valves it should be noted however that the experimental setup does not have the capability to impart a prescribed load to the motor without the ability to apply a load to the system it would be difficult to fully characterize the resulting controllers therefore a matlab simulink model of the experimental test setup was first validated for the no load case and then used to provide insight into controller operation under loaded conditions the bb4 800 motor was modelled in the computer simulator as a fixed displacement hydraulic motor where additional orifices were added to match the manufacturer specified leakage characteristics sampro hydraulics ltd 2012 referring to fig 1 the pvg 120 proportional valve was modelled as a set of four orifices corresponding to output ports a and b the pressure port p and the tank port t the valve orifice to port t was modelled based on the manufacturer specification sheet danfoss 2013 while the fluid flow path from p to a and b was modelled based on experimentally obtained data of the motor velocity as a function of the valve control signal to model the pump a simple pid control system was applied which maintained a specific pressure drop across the load sense valve as a function of the control voltage applied to the valve the corresponding pressure voltage relationship was measured experimentally fig 4 plots the angular velocity of the experimental and the simulated hydraulic motor as a function of time for the case shown in fig 4 the hydraulic valve was linearly ramped over 60 s through its operating range of 3 v 9 v a detailed analysis of the tuning construction and validation of the simulator and hardware can be found in woodacre 2015 the overall system control logic is described in the following section 3 control methodology the block diagram in fig 5 shows the controller logic followed when implementing both mpc and pid controllers the controller block generates a control signal based on the motor angle and the desired setpoint the mpc controller also uses the output from a heave prediction algorithm for the purposes of setpoint previewing the heave prediction algorithm is an implementation of the work carried out by kuchler et al 2011 within mpc setpoint previewing allows the controller to apply preemptive control action based on future setpoint changes and a system model the non linear gain correction and deadband correction blocks adjust the controller output voltage such that from the point of view of the controller the valve and motor system follow the linear tf response shown in fig 3 encoder feedback provides information on the resulting motor angular position 3 1 controller implementations using the model shown in equation 1 the mpc control action is determined through quadratic minimization of the following cost function j 2 j i 0 n p x i t q x i i 0 n c u i t p u i i 0 n c δ u i t r δ u i x m i n x i x m a x u m i n u i u m a x n c n p where q p and r are unitless weighting parameters for the model state error x the controller output u and the rate of change of the controller output δ u respectively the parameter n p represents the prediction horizon over which the controller allows the model to evolve while n c is the control horizon which determines how many time steps forward the control action is calculated in this work a 50 msec time step is used for the case when i n c the controller output u i and rate of change of the controller output δ u i are held constant and the minimization evolves the system based on the model further details of the fundamentals and recent develops of mpc are widely available di ruscio 2013 di ruscio 2012 kimiaghalam et al 2001 mayne et al 2000 since x i is the state error at each time step i if the state trajectory is known for future time steps then minimizing j will result in improved control action compared to assuming that the state remains constant at each time step in this paper the state x is the heave motion of a vessel at sea therefore in order to determine the state trajectory the vessel motion must be predicted into the future following the work by kuchler et al 2011 vessel heave motion can be predicted by using an fft on previous heave motion data to determine the common wave modes a state estimator can then be applied to determine the amplitude and phase of each mode the resulting wave modes and corresponding estimates of amplitude and phase information can then be used to predict future heave action which in turn can be used with mpc to improve controller action in the experimental and simulated test cases 4 test cases four heave motion test cases shown in fig 6 were used to compare the tracking ability of the mpc and pid controllers within this work for each test case there are two axes the left axis indicates motor rotation in revolutions revs while the right axis is the equivalent heave motion in meters assuming that a 16 inch 0 4046 m diameter winch drum is attached to the hydraulic motor the benchmark case was digitized from heave motion data used by kuchler et al 2011 and used as a baseline for comparison between this work and their work note however that kuchler et al utilized an experimental setup with an approximately 0 7 s delay as well as a loaded testbed both of which make direct comparison between their controller and the mpc controller used in this work difficult since this work utilized a 0 25 s future motion prediction and an unloaded testbed despite these differences the results presented by kuchler et al 2011 are valuable in that they provide a standard by which to compare experimental performance which is difficult to find in practice test cases a b and c were generated to represent motions a small boat might experience while at sea test case a was generated to represent ship motion with prominent frequency modes at 6 67 10 2 hz 1 00 10 1 hz and 1 22 10 1 hz test case b used the test case a data and added an additional frequency mode at 3 18 10 2 hz to test the tracking of more vigorous motions such as a small vessel in the wake or bow wave of a larger vessel test case c built upon the test case b data set by adding a slow frequency sweep from 0 5 hz to 0 9 hz to represent changing conditions it should be pointed out that the test case c data set is used to examine the system s operation limits for other applications as 0 9 hz motions would not be expected for typical ahc operations the mpc parameters used in the experiments were tuned by minimizing the tracking error for the benchmark case the resulting tuned parameters are summarized in table 1 the mpc controller was then compared against a common pid controller the corresponding pid controller was implemented using the following equations 3 e k s p k p v k u p k k p e k u i k u i k 1 k p t i e k e k 1 2 δ t u d k k p t d δ t p v k p v k 1 u k u p k u i k u d k

mpc were held constant throughout all experimental and simulated tests 5 experimental results to compare the pid controller to the heave predictive mpc controller each controller was used to experimentally track the four test cases from fig 6 using the ahc testbed described in section 2 labview software was used to implement the pid and mpc controllers for the experiments labview allowed for real time system control using national instruments hardware the results of the mpc controller tracking the benchmark case are shown in fig 7 where the upper plot provides the reference set point data as black circles and the actual system response as a red line plotted as a function of time the left axis is the testbed motor rotation in revolutions revs while the right axis shows the equivalent vertical heave motion of the ship assuming that a 16 inch 0 4046 m diameter winch drum is used to feed out cable for an ahc system since the set point data and the actual system response are difficult to distinguish the lower plot in fig 7 shows the error between the tracked reference and ahc testbed motor angle as a function of time the metric used in this paper to compare the results is the standard deviation of the error plot between 5 and 80 s to omit the initial transients a smaller standard deviation therefore suggests better controller performance for the mpc controller the resulting error standard deviation when tracking the benchmark case is 1 30 10 2 revs 1 66 10 2 m fig 8 shows the results of the pid controller tracking the benchmark case where the units for the axes in fig 8 match those of fig 7 as can be seen in this figure the pid controller achieves an error standard deviation of 1 88 10 2 revs 2 40 10 2 m using standard deviation as the comparison metric means that for pid control the tracking error falls within 1 88 10 2 revs 2 40 cm 68 2 of the time while for mpc control the tracking error falls within 1 30 10 2 revs 1 66 cm 68 2 of the time a difference of 5 8 10 3 revs 7 4 mm may at first glance seem small however this difference actually represents an overall reduction of 14 8 mm of motion which may be significant if high precision positioning is important it is common in the field of ahc research to report motion decoupling as a percent reduction from the original motion data for the benchmark case the standard deviation of the original motion is 1 3774 revs therefore the percent motion reduction from the original heave motion to the decoupled heave motion is 1 3774 1 88 10 2 1 3774 100 98 6 for the pid controller and 1 3774 1 30 10 2 1 3774 100 99 1 for the mpc controller fig 9 provides a comparison of pid and mpc error standard deviation for all of the test cases studied in this research for test case a the pid error standard deviation shows that the tracking error falls within 1 65 10 2 revs 2 11 cm 68 2 of the time while the mpc error standard deviation shows that the tracking error falls within 1 31 10 2 revs 1 67 cm 68 2 of the time the difference between pid and mpc error standard deviation for test case a is 3 40 10 3 revs which corresponds to 4 3 mm or a reduction in load motion of 8 6 mm when using mpc instead of pid control for the benchmark case and test case a both pid and mpc controllers are comparable however the significant differences between pid and mpc control become apparent when examining test cases b and c both of these test cases contain high frequency components in the heave motion data referring to test case b in fig 9 the pid error standard deviation shows that the tracking error falls within 7 24 10 2 revs 9 24 cm 68 2 of the time while the mpc error standard deviation shows that the tracking error falls within 2 16 10 2 revs 2 76 cm 68 2 of the time the difference between pid and mpc error standard deviation for test case b is 5 08 10 2 revs which corresponds to 6 5 cm or a reduction in load motion of 13 0 cm when using mpc instead of pid control referring to test case c in fig 9 the pid error standard deviation shows that the tracking error falls within 1 62 10 1 revs 20 7 cm 68 2 of the time while the mpc error standard deviation shows that the tracking error falls within 5 89 10 2 revs 7 52 cm 68 2 of the time the difference between pid and mpc error standard deviation for test case c is 1 03 10 1 revs which corresponds to 13 2 cm or a reduction in load motion of 26 4 cm when using mpc instead of pid control and corresponds to a 20 7 7 52 20 7 7 52 2 100 93 3 error difference between pid and mpc control the error difference between mpc and pid increases from 14 8 mm for the benchmark case and 8 6 mm for test case a to 13 cm for test case b and 26 4 cm for test case c a 13 cm and 26 4 cm reduction in error for mpc compared to pid is significant and suggests that the mpc controller is more robust to changing conditions when compared to the pid controller this robustness is a desirable trait for a controller as it allows the same controller to be used under multiple heave motion conditions without needing to modify any controller tuning parameters 6 mpc model robustness the effectiveness of the mpc controller to decouple the motion is dependent at least partially on the accuracy of the identified system model in this work the identified linear first order system model shown in equation 1 was used by the mpc controller to generate the results shown in figs 7 and 9 the corner frequency of this identified model was then modified to create new models which were used by the mpc controller in order to investigate mpc s robustness to errors in the identified model the results are summarized in fig 10 where the cross in each plot indicates the nominal experimentally measured corner frequency of 23 78 rad s 3 78 hz this experimentally measured corner frequency was then scaled by 0 1 0 6 0 8 1 2 1 4 and 10 and fig 10 shows four plots of the resulting mpc error standard deviation as a function of these different corner frequencies one plot for the benchmark case and one plot for each of the test cases a b and c referring to fig 10 for the benchmark case as well as test cases a b and c reducing the corner frequency by a decade had the largest effect as it increased the corresponding tracking error by 5 93 10 2 6 92 10 2 6 36 10 2 and 8 91 10 2 revs respectively it is however unlikely that a model corner frequency would be so poorly identified in a system as to be a decade lower or higher than the actual value focusing on the range from 0 6 to 1 4 multiples 40 of the model corner frequency shows relatively small changes in error standard deviation indicating that the mpc controller is robust against errors in model identification test case c exhibits the widest range of errors ranging from 4 23 10 2 revs to 5 57 10 2 revs a 5 57 10 2 4 23 10 2 4 23 10 2 100 31 7 difference this 31 7 difference for a poorly identified mpc model however is still well below the 93 3 error difference between pid and mpc control observed for test case c in fig 9 therefore for this system mpc control with identified model errors provides improved control over the pid controller used as a result of this analysis one should expect acceptable results from the mpc system if the identified corner frequency is within 40 of the actual value 7 simulator and experimental comparison a matlab simulink model of the experimental test setup was developed and the resulting simulator was validated using the benchmark experimental data using both pid and mpc control matlab was selected as the simulation tool due to the comprehensive physical modelling toolbox simscape and simhydraulics these toolboxes allowed a complete model to be developed and validated the detailed model accounted for friction and the hydraulic leakages the details of the model construction is publicly available woodacre 2015 fig 11 compares the simulator and experimental results using the pid controller while fig 12 compares the simulator and experimental results using the mpc controller in both figures the upper plot shows the reference set point data as black circles the simulator predictions as blue lines and the experimental results as red dashed lines plotted as a function of time the left axis is the testbed motor rotation in revolutions revs while the right axis shows the equivalent vertical heave motion of the ship assuming that a 16 inch 0 4046 m diameter winch drum is used to feed out cable for the ahc system since in both figs 11 and 12 the set point data predicted and actual system response are difficult to distinguish the middle plot in each figure shows the corresponding differences between the simulation and experimental reference tracking as a function of time while the bottom plot in each figure shows the difference between the simulation error signal and the experimental error signal referring to the pid controller results in fig 11 the simulator error signal standard deviation is 1 60 10 2 revs 2 04 cm which is very similar to the experimental error signal standard deviation of 1 88 10 2 revs 2 40 cm representing a difference of less than 8 mm 4 mm furthermore the computer simulator also accurately captures the individual fluctuations observed in the experimental error signal as a function of time fig 12 on the other hand shows reasonable agreement between the simulator and experimental reference tracking results using an mpc controller the simulator error signal standard deviation is 2 83 10 2 revs while the experimental error standard deviation is 1 30 10 2 revs comparing the bottom plot in figs 12 and 11 it can be seen that the discrepancy between simulation and experiment is significantly larger for mpc than for pid given the excellent agreement between simulation and experiment with pid control the observed difference with mpc is likely due to the way mpc is implemented in the optimization methods functions within the software packages used the experiments used labview while the simulations used matlab simulink figs 13 and 14 summarize the experimental and simulation error signal standard deviations for all four test cases using pid and mpc respectively in these figures the black bars correspond to the experimental results while the white bars correspond to the simulation results referring to the pid results shown in fig 13 the experimental and simulation error signal standard deviations are on average within 20 of each other confirming that the simulator model is indeed a good representation of the experimental system comparing figs 13 and 14 it should be noted that a larger discrepancy exists in the standard deviation of the error signal over all four test cases when mpc is used instead of pid again suggesting a different implementation of mpc within the two different software packages used in this research referring to fig 9 however it should be recalled that for the cases studied in this research mpc outperforms the pid controller the discussion pertaining to figs 13 and 14 only pertains to how accurately the simulator was able to predict the error signal of the system when mpc and pid control are implemented 8 loaded simulator given that the experimental testbed did not have the capability of applying a load to the system the computer simulator was used instead to test the performance of pid and mpc control in the presence of a load fig 15 shows the simulation motion results using mpc control to track the benchmark case when applying a constant 8890 n 2000 lbf load to the winch drum cable in an ideal perfect control system the application of a load would not affect the resulting motion of the system the upper plot of fig 15 shows the angular drum position as a function of time for the loaded and unloaded simulator with the equivalent heave motion shown on the right hand vertical axis the middle plot shows the reference tracking error for the loaded and unloaded simulator while the lower plot shows the difference between these two tracking error curves it can be seen from the middle plot of fig 15 that the loaded case solid line generally lags slightly behind the unloaded case dashed line when the angular position in the top plot of fig 15 is decreasing corresponding to a negative angular velocity of the winch this lag occurs when the winch is hauling in the cable and is due to a higher system pressure during the haul in operations which increases the amount of hydraulic fluid loss due to leakage and reduces the amount of fluid available to move the load the system model used by the mpc controller was identified using an unloaded winch this model does not account for pressure related fluid leakage therefore the mpc controller does not correct for the reduced speed from the leakage observed during the hauling in operations moreover there are inherent challenges and risks with identifying a winch motor model with a load attached referring to fig 16 however the pid controller showed no significant difference between the loaded and unloaded cases given this observation the present authors hypothesised that the addition of a proportional integral pi controller in parallel with mpc could account for the fluid leakage and effectively remove the offset observed with the simulated loaded mpc system in fig 15 thus allowing for one to identify an unloaded model of the winch for the mpc controller and still obtain the improved tracking when the system is loaded 8 1 loaded mpc pi controller implementation d ruscio di ruscio 2013 explains that the standard formulation of a mpc controller will not often achieve integral control as it is not an optimal action the mpc is attempting to obtain the optimal control action many researcher have proposed alterative formulations by adding an integrator to the input or disturbance signals mayne et al 2000 alternatively d ruscio di ruscio 2013 di ruscio 2012 applied a form of integral control with an mpc via a linear quadratic optimal controller the current authors believe that a simple pi controller could account for a motor leakage when the system is loaded and be assessable by industrial users and maritime operators of the proposed methodology to test the mpc pi hypothesis fig 17 shows how the pi controller was placed in parallel with the existing mpc controller such that both controllers acted on the same error signal and their corresponding control outputs were superimposed referring to equation 3 the new pi controller used the same proportional and integral gains as the author s pid controller while the mpc controller remained unchanged fig 18 compares the simulation results of this new mpc pi control scheme with the unloaded benchmark case and shows that the tracking error falls within 4 86 10 3 revs 6 2 mm 68 2 of the time for the unloaded case and 4 94 10 3 revs 6 3 mm 68 2 of the time for the loaded case the bottom plot of fig 18 is the error difference between the loaded and unloaded scenario for the mpc pi controller this plot shows that the theoretical discrepancy between the loaded and unloaded mpc pi controller has a standard deviation of only 3 19e 3 revs 4 mm which is even smaller by about a factor of two than that observed using pid control based on the standard deviation metrics mpc pi result suggest that one could expect decoupling efficiency to reach 1 3774 4 94 10 3 1 3774 100 99 6 the near perfect decoupling observed with mpc combined with a set point previewing algorithm in parallel with a pi controller is consistent with hatleskog and dunnigan 2007 who pointed out that a predictive controller may be helpful for an ahc system to approach 100 decoupling fig 19 summarizes the standard deviation of the tracking error signal results of the mpc pid and mpc pi control systems for both the loaded and unloaded simulation cases the figure shows that the new mpc pi controller outperforms the mpc and pid controllers in every instance by on average 65 the simulations suggest that one can tune the mpc and pi controllers independently allowing for a user to use common tuning techniques further work will need to be carried out on physical hardware under loaded conditions to further test this new mpc pi control approach 9 conclusion this work presents an ahc experimental testbed that uses a common hydraulic 4 way 3 position proportional valve to drive a hydraulic motor on an open loop hydraulic circuit the inherent hysteresis with this valve was corrected using a dither signal while the deadband and non linear gain associated with this valve were overcome in software such that the nonlinear valve and motor system appeared linear to the pid and mpc controllers a corresponding mathematical model of the ahc testbed was identified and used with a heave prediction mpc controller to actuate the unloaded full scale ahc testbed for the benchmark case and three additional test cases the heave prediction mpc controller performed better than a tuned pid controller although mpc requires a mathematical model of the system which may be difficult to identify accurately due to signal noise and nonlinearities the authors observed that for the conditions used in this research mpc was very robust to model uncertainty for example if a first order system model has corner frequencies identified within 40 of the actual value then the mpc tracking ability was found to be minimally affected in the extreme a corner frequency reduced by a factor of ten led to unacceptable tracking results for all cases while a corner frequency increased by a factor of ten showed reasonable tracking for relatively slow heave motions without any high frequency components mpc and pid control was then implemented on a computer simulator of the ahc testbed the pid controller simulation results of the error signal estimates were on average within 20 of the experimental results for the standard deviation metric used to quantify the results in this research the discrepancies observed when comparing the mpc controller simulation results with experimental data are likely due to different implementations of mpc within the different software packages used in this research applying a load within the simulator and tracking the test case motions with mpc shows that motor leakage due to the high load pressure causes the loaded system motion to lag behind the unloaded system motion to overcome this issue a new parallel mpc pi control scheme was implemented on the simulator the new mpc pi system used the same model and gains as the original mpc and pid controllers simulation results showed that this mpc pi controller was able to correct for the motor leakage and outperform the basic mpc and pid controllers by an average of 65 acknowledgements the authors would like to thank rolls royce canada limited and the atlantic canada opportunities agency acoa

23570,this work showcases the development and results of a model predictive controller mpc for a marine active heave compensation ahc system the system utilizes a common hydraulic 4 way 3 position proportional valve where the hysteresis dead band and non linear properties have been overcome to directly control a radial piston motor in the experimental test setup the mpc controller with a set point prediction algorithm is used to actuate the unloaded hydraulic test system and the results are compared to a tuned proportional integral derivative pid controller operating the same experimental setup the mpc controller is found to track a variety of test cases and references while outperforming the tuned pid controller for all experiments additionally a matlab simulink model of the experimental setup is created and validated within the simulator a load is then applied to the winch to test how the mpc and pid performance compare under loaded operating conditions based on the results of these tests simulations of an mpc controller running in parallel with a proportional integral pi controller are carried out for both the unloaded and loaded scenarios for the conditions tested in this research the resulting simulations suggest that the mpc pi controller is able to decouple up to 99 6 of the transmitted motion keywords active heave compensation winch control control systems model predictive control hydraulic systems 1 introduction considerable work has been done in the development of active heave compensation ahc systems for marine operations woodacre et al 2015 motion decoupling between for example a submerged remotely operated vehicle rov and its host ship can greatly reduce the tether loads and improve the safety of operators one of the first active heave systems was designed by southerland in 1970 southerland 1970 using a spring loaded tether attached from a crane boom on one ship to the deck of a second ship for position feedback as the tether pulled in and out it moved a hydraulic proportional valve which adjusted the load thereby maintaining a constant height from the deck this relatively simple mechanical feedback system has since been replaced with computer control control algorithms in an active heave system can be as simple as basic pi control as was used by gu et al 2013 for a hoisting rig or using a model based control system as used by yang et al 2008 to decouple an rov tether management system korde 1998 used accelerometers to create a state feedback system actuating a vibration absorber to reduce heave motion in a drill string riser other researchers have applied non linear control systems with disturbance observers do and pan 2008 or applied observers to estimate tether dynamics as part of the control scheme baddour and raman nair 2002 recent work by quan et al 2016 has gone further by combining models of tether dynamics a combined feed forward and pid controller and a passive heave compensator all within a single system in any control system corrections for the inherent lag perhaps introduced by the actuator or through slow communication between the inertial measurement unit imu and the control system must be made to try to achieve optimum control performance a system by kyllingstad kyllingstad 2012 for example applied transfer function filters to correct for time and phase lag in their overall system alternatively kuchler et al 2011 used heave prediction algorithms to predict vessel heave motion based on previous measurements and then applied a control action based on these predicted motions built upon a similar linear drill string model as used by korde 1998 hatleskog and dunnigan 2007 derived a linear transfer function model for an active passive hybrid system using feedfoward control on displacement as opposed to korde who used acceleration which attempts to correct for system phase lag in the 2007 work by hatleskog and dunnigan 2007 it is briefly mentioned that a predictive controller may be helpful in creating an ahc system that approaches 100 effectiveness in heave motion decoupling reasoning is not given as to how prediction may improve performance nevertheless it is possible that a predictive controller could be useful in systems where a significant but consistent and known time lag exists between heave measurement and actual motion prediction could also be used to partially correct for a large phase lag within the controller structure hastlekog and dunnigan go on to say that heave motion of a vessel is essentially unpredictable with a high probability of significant predictive error halliday et al 2006 in 2006 published work providing a method for using fast fourier transforms fft to accurately predict wave motion within approximately 10 up to 10 s into the future and up to 50 m away from the point of measurement although halliday et al intended to use short term wave prediction to increase efficiency of wave energy collectors their work is easily adaptable to predicting short term ship motion using imu data at a conference in 2008 neupert et al 2008 presented work to this effect where they used heave motion prediction as part of the control methodology for an ahc crane their approach used a linearized model of the crane dynamics along with the pole placement control method to set load position neupert et al 2008 perform simulations showing that their controller can track a step input to within 3 cm with a ship heave motion of approximately 0 5 m in the follow up work to neupert et al 2008 kuchler et al 2011 reported that the energy in the load could be reduced by 83 for their nonpredictive controller while energy in the load could be reduced by 98 2 for their predictive controller showing an improvement when using heave prediction in their experimental system kuchler et al 2011 report a delay of approximately 0 7 s between sensor measurements and actuator response it is possible that the inability of their controller to completely decouple load from heave motion is caused by the prediction algorithm error when trying to predict 0 7 s into the future coupling the inherent system phase lag with additional time delay can lead to significant system delays in the phase diagram which cannot be easily compensated for to combat inherent system lag and to emulate a linear response ahc systems often employ specialized and expensive hydraulic swash plate pumps motors and servo valves rexrothboschgroup 2015 it is possible for these ahc systems to be in the hydraulic open loop or closed loop circuit configuration both hydraulic configurations have their advantages and disadvantages rexrothboschgroup 2015 however open loop system are common and flexible in their operation woodacre et al 2015 the current paper introduces a possible option to help correct for large phase lag using model predictive control mpc while preserving system flexibility with a simple 4 way 3 position proportional valve on a hydraulic open loop circuit a review of ahc literature shows that an mpc controller in combination with wave prediction has not yet been used for the purposes of controlling an ahc system mpc relies on a system model to determine optimal controller output by solving a quadratic optimization problem additionally mpc is capable of utilizing knowledge of future set points in order to react to these changes before they happen a process called previewing in the current work an mpc controller with wave prediction is used to actuate an unloaded hydraulic test setup and the results are compared to a pid controller operating the same experimental setup where pid was used as comparison as it is common in industry and serves a suitable benchmark for controller development a corresponding computer simulator of the test setup is then developed to compare the performance of mpc and pid control when a simulated load is applied section 2 outlines the hydraulic hardware used within this paper and how the limitations of a common hydraulic valve were overcome section 3 explains the control methodology used both experimentally and in simulation while section 4 shows the baseline heave motion reference data used in this research along with three additional test cases corresponding to different at sea conditions section 5 then compares the mpc controller to a pid controller for each test case while section 6 examines the robustness of mpc control to errors in model identification section 7 compares the performance of mpc and pid controllers on the experimental setup as well as on a matlab simulation of the experimental system without an applied load finally section 8 predicts how the experimental system would respond if a load were applied to the winch and a new mpc pi controller is developed and tested within the simulation environment 2 testbed hardware fig 1 shows a schematic of the open loop hydraulic ahc testbed used in this work an eaton pvm141er load sensing pump provides flow to the danfoss pvg 120 4 way 3 position proportional valve this valve is controlled via a voltage signal which opens the valve directing flow to and from the black bruin bb4 800 hydraulic motor proportional valves such as the danfoss pvg 120 used in this work have a hysteresis which is caused by flow forces acting against the spool residual magnetism of the armature and the inertia of the spool vickers incorporated 1999 to reduce this hysteresis a 50 hz sinusoidal dither signal was superimposed on the valve s control signal having a peak voltage v p k of 0 3 v this dither value was selected because it proved to be most effective at reducing the hysteresis over the range of frequencies and amplitudes tested woodacre 2015 the two graphs shown in fig 2 plot the angular velocity of the hydraulic motor as a function of the control voltage signal supplied to the valve for clarity only one direction of the motor s rotation is displayed as the control voltage to the valve is swept through the operational range the lefthand plot shows the system response without any added dither while the righthand side figure shows the system with the added 50 hz 0 3 v p k dither superimposed on top of the commanded control signal from fig 2 the dither effectively reduces the valve s hysteresis while allowing the spool to travel resulting in an angular velocity increase from an average value of 4 20 rps in the no dither case to a value of 4 85 rps in the dither case a 15 increase in the angular velocity additionally the proportional valve has two major non linear properties which are corrected for in this work deadband and non linear gain the deadband is a range of control voltages from 5 37 v to 7 12 v in which the valve remains closed below 5 37 v the valve opens in one direction and above 7 12 v the valve opens in the other direction physically the deadband is a range of spool positions within the valve where fluid flow is blocked from travelling from the pump to the valve outputs to avoid this deadband an offset is added to the valve control voltage in order to skip the voltages corresponding to the deadband thus as far as the controller is concerned the deadband does not exist fig 3 shows the resulting system angular velocity response in revolutions per second rps as a function of control voltage after the deadband has been corrected the valve s non linear gain is demonstrated in this figure by the deviation between the experimentally measured system response and the linear transfer function tf response this tf response is derived from the following tf 1 ω r p s v 26 6167 s 23 78 where ω is the angular velocity in rps and v is the control voltage this tf was identified from experimental step response data collected in the linear region of fig 3 between 0 68 v and 0 68 v to linearize the system response outside the 0 68 v and 0 68 v range a custom algorithm was implemented to modify the valve control voltage signal as illustrated in the following example assume that the intention is to apply a control voltage of 2v to the valve this control voltage labeled a in fig 3 corresponds to an actual motor velocity of 4 5 rps as represented by point b it is desired however that the system react according to the linear tf response in fig 3 with an angular velocity corresponding to b instead of b following the arrows across to point c and then down through point d a new control voltage of 1v is generated which is then sent to the valve instead of the original control voltage of 2v the addition of dither and the implementation of the deadband and non linear gain corrections allow for improved control and a more deterministic system response when all three of these modifiers are used on the common proportional valve the valve begins to emulate more sophisticated and expensive servo valves it should be noted however that the experimental setup does not have the capability to impart a prescribed load to the motor without the ability to apply a load to the system it would be difficult to fully characterize the resulting controllers therefore a matlab simulink model of the experimental test setup was first validated for the no load case and then used to provide insight into controller operation under loaded conditions the bb4 800 motor was modelled in the computer simulator as a fixed displacement hydraulic motor where additional orifices were added to match the manufacturer specified leakage characteristics sampro hydraulics ltd 2012 referring to fig 1 the pvg 120 proportional valve was modelled as a set of four orifices corresponding to output ports a and b the pressure port p and the tank port t the valve orifice to port t was modelled based on the manufacturer specification sheet danfoss 2013 while the fluid flow path from p to a and b was modelled based on experimentally obtained data of the motor velocity as a function of the valve control signal to model the pump a simple pid control system was applied which maintained a specific pressure drop across the load sense valve as a function of the control voltage applied to the valve the corresponding pressure voltage relationship was measured experimentally fig 4 plots the angular velocity of the experimental and the simulated hydraulic motor as a function of time for the case shown in fig 4 the hydraulic valve was linearly ramped over 60 s through its operating range of 3 v 9 v a detailed analysis of the tuning construction and validation of the simulator and hardware can be found in woodacre 2015 the overall system control logic is described in the following section 3 control methodology the block diagram in fig 5 shows the controller logic followed when implementing both mpc and pid controllers the controller block generates a control signal based on the motor angle and the desired setpoint the mpc controller also uses the output from a heave prediction algorithm for the purposes of setpoint previewing the heave prediction algorithm is an implementation of the work carried out by kuchler et al 2011 within mpc setpoint previewing allows the controller to apply preemptive control action based on future setpoint changes and a system model the non linear gain correction and deadband correction blocks adjust the controller output voltage such that from the point of view of the controller the valve and motor system follow the linear tf response shown in fig 3 encoder feedback provides information on the resulting motor angular position 3 1 controller implementations using the model shown in equation 1 the mpc control action is determined through quadratic minimization of the following cost function j 2 j i 0 n p x i t q x i i 0 n c u i t p u i i 0 n c δ u i t r δ u i x m i n x i x m a x u m i n u i u m a x n c n p where q p and r are unitless weighting parameters for the model state error x the controller output u and the rate of change of the controller output δ u respectively the parameter n p represents the prediction horizon over which the controller allows the model to evolve while n c is the control horizon which determines how many time steps forward the control action is calculated in this work a 50 msec time step is used for the case when i n c the controller output u i and rate of change of the controller output δ u i are held constant and the minimization evolves the system based on the model further details of the fundamentals and recent develops of mpc are widely available di ruscio 2013 di ruscio 2012 kimiaghalam et al 2001 mayne et al 2000 since x i is the state error at each time step i if the state trajectory is known for future time steps then minimizing j will result in improved control action compared to assuming that the state remains constant at each time step in this paper the state x is the heave motion of a vessel at sea therefore in order to determine the state trajectory the vessel motion must be predicted into the future following the work by kuchler et al 2011 vessel heave motion can be predicted by using an fft on previous heave motion data to determine the common wave modes a state estimator can then be applied to determine the amplitude and phase of each mode the resulting wave modes and corresponding estimates of amplitude and phase information can then be used to predict future heave action which in turn can be used with mpc to improve controller action in the experimental and simulated test cases 4 test cases four heave motion test cases shown in fig 6 were used to compare the tracking ability of the mpc and pid controllers within this work for each test case there are two axes the left axis indicates motor rotation in revolutions revs while the right axis is the equivalent heave motion in meters assuming that a 16 inch 0 4046 m diameter winch drum is attached to the hydraulic motor the benchmark case was digitized from heave motion data used by kuchler et al 2011 and used as a baseline for comparison between this work and their work note however that kuchler et al utilized an experimental setup with an approximately 0 7 s delay as well as a loaded testbed both of which make direct comparison between their controller and the mpc controller used in this work difficult since this work utilized a 0 25 s future motion prediction and an unloaded testbed despite these differences the results presented by kuchler et al 2011 are valuable in that they provide a standard by which to compare experimental performance which is difficult to find in practice test cases a b and c were generated to represent motions a small boat might experience while at sea test case a was generated to represent ship motion with prominent frequency modes at 6 67 10 2 hz 1 00 10 1 hz and 1 22 10 1 hz test case b used the test case a data and added an additional frequency mode at 3 18 10 2 hz to test the tracking of more vigorous motions such as a small vessel in the wake or bow wave of a larger vessel test case c built upon the test case b data set by adding a slow frequency sweep from 0 5 hz to 0 9 hz to represent changing conditions it should be pointed out that the test case c data set is used to examine the system s operation limits for other applications as 0 9 hz motions would not be expected for typical ahc operations the mpc parameters used in the experiments were tuned by minimizing the tracking error for the benchmark case the resulting tuned parameters are summarized in table 1 the mpc controller was then compared against a common pid controller the corresponding pid controller was implemented using the following equations 3 e k s p k p v k u p k k p e k u i k u i k 1 k p t i e k e k 1 2 δ t u d k k p t d δ t p v k p v k 1 u k u p k u i k u d k

mpc were held constant throughout all experimental and simulated tests 5 experimental results to compare the pid controller to the heave predictive mpc controller each controller was used to experimentally track the four test cases from fig 6 using the ahc testbed described in section 2 labview software was used to implement the pid and mpc controllers for the experiments labview allowed for real time system control using national instruments hardware the results of the mpc controller tracking the benchmark case are shown in fig 7 where the upper plot provides the reference set point data as black circles and the actual system response as a red line plotted as a function of time the left axis is the testbed motor rotation in revolutions revs while the right axis shows the equivalent vertical heave motion of the ship assuming that a 16 inch 0 4046 m diameter winch drum is used to feed out cable for an ahc system since the set point data and the actual system response are difficult to distinguish the lower plot in fig 7 shows the error between the tracked reference and ahc testbed motor angle as a function of time the metric used in this paper to compare the results is the standard deviation of the error plot between 5 and 80 s to omit the initial transients a smaller standard deviation therefore suggests better controller performance for the mpc controller the resulting error standard deviation when tracking the benchmark case is 1 30 10 2 revs 1 66 10 2 m fig 8 shows the results of the pid controller tracking the benchmark case where the units for the axes in fig 8 match those of fig 7 as can be seen in this figure the pid controller achieves an error standard deviation of 1 88 10 2 revs 2 40 10 2 m using standard deviation as the comparison metric means that for pid control the tracking error falls within 1 88 10 2 revs 2 40 cm 68 2 of the time while for mpc control the tracking error falls within 1 30 10 2 revs 1 66 cm 68 2 of the time a difference of 5 8 10 3 revs 7 4 mm may at first glance seem small however this difference actually represents an overall reduction of 14 8 mm of motion which may be significant if high precision positioning is important it is common in the field of ahc research to report motion decoupling as a percent reduction from the original motion data for the benchmark case the standard deviation of the original motion is 1 3774 revs therefore the percent motion reduction from the original heave motion to the decoupled heave motion is 1 3774 1 88 10 2 1 3774 100 98 6 for the pid controller and 1 3774 1 30 10 2 1 3774 100 99 1 for the mpc controller fig 9 provides a comparison of pid and mpc error standard deviation for all of the test cases studied in this research for test case a the pid error standard deviation shows that the tracking error falls within 1 65 10 2 revs 2 11 cm 68 2 of the time while the mpc error standard deviation shows that the tracking error falls within 1 31 10 2 revs 1 67 cm 68 2 of the time the difference between pid and mpc error standard deviation for test case a is 3 40 10 3 revs which corresponds to 4 3 mm or a reduction in load motion of 8 6 mm when using mpc instead of pid control for the benchmark case and test case a both pid and mpc controllers are comparable however the significant differences between pid and mpc control become apparent when examining test cases b and c both of these test cases contain high frequency components in the heave motion data referring to test case b in fig 9 the pid error standard deviation shows that the tracking error falls within 7 24 10 2 revs 9 24 cm 68 2 of the time while the mpc error standard deviation shows that the tracking error falls within 2 16 10 2 revs 2 76 cm 68 2 of the time the difference between pid and mpc error standard deviation for test case b is 5 08 10 2 revs which corresponds to 6 5 cm or a reduction in load motion of 13 0 cm when using mpc instead of pid control referring to test case c in fig 9 the pid error standard deviation shows that the tracking error falls within 1 62 10 1 revs 20 7 cm 68 2 of the time while the mpc error standard deviation shows that the tracking error falls within 5 89 10 2 revs 7 52 cm 68 2 of the time the difference between pid and mpc error standard deviation for test case c is 1 03 10 1 revs which corresponds to 13 2 cm or a reduction in load motion of 26 4 cm when using mpc instead of pid control and corresponds to a 20 7 7 52 20 7 7 52 2 100 93 3 error difference between pid and mpc control the error difference between mpc and pid increases from 14 8 mm for the benchmark case and 8 6 mm for test case a to 13 cm for test case b and 26 4 cm for test case c a 13 cm and 26 4 cm reduction in error for mpc compared to pid is significant and suggests that the mpc controller is more robust to changing conditions when compared to the pid controller this robustness is a desirable trait for a controller as it allows the same controller to be used under multiple heave motion conditions without needing to modify any controller tuning parameters 6 mpc model robustness the effectiveness of the mpc controller to decouple the motion is dependent at least partially on the accuracy of the identified system model in this work the identified linear first order system model shown in equation 1 was used by the mpc controller to generate the results shown in figs 7 and 9 the corner frequency of this identified model was then modified to create new models which were used by the mpc controller in order to investigate mpc s robustness to errors in the identified model the results are summarized in fig 10 where the cross in each plot indicates the nominal experimentally measured corner frequency of 23 78 rad s 3 78 hz this experimentally measured corner frequency was then scaled by 0 1 0 6 0 8 1 2 1 4 and 10 and fig 10 shows four plots of the resulting mpc error standard deviation as a function of these different corner frequencies one plot for the benchmark case and one plot for each of the test cases a b and c referring to fig 10 for the benchmark case as well as test cases a b and c reducing the corner frequency by a decade had the largest effect as it increased the corresponding tracking error by 5 93 10 2 6 92 10 2 6 36 10 2 and 8 91 10 2 revs respectively it is however unlikely that a model corner frequency would be so poorly identified in a system as to be a decade lower or higher than the actual value focusing on the range from 0 6 to 1 4 multiples 40 of the model corner frequency shows relatively small changes in error standard deviation indicating that the mpc controller is robust against errors in model identification test case c exhibits the widest range of errors ranging from 4 23 10 2 revs to 5 57 10 2 revs a 5 57 10 2 4 23 10 2 4 23 10 2 100 31 7 difference this 31 7 difference for a poorly identified mpc model however is still well below the 93 3 error difference between pid and mpc control observed for test case c in fig 9 therefore for this system mpc control with identified model errors provides improved control over the pid controller used as a result of this analysis one should expect acceptable results from the mpc system if the identified corner frequency is within 40 of the actual value 7 simulator and experimental comparison a matlab simulink model of the experimental test setup was developed and the resulting simulator was validated using the benchmark experimental data using both pid and mpc control matlab was selected as the simulation tool due to the comprehensive physical modelling toolbox simscape and simhydraulics these toolboxes allowed a complete model to be developed and validated the detailed model accounted for friction and the hydraulic leakages the details of the model construction is publicly available woodacre 2015 fig 11 compares the simulator and experimental results using the pid controller while fig 12 compares the simulator and experimental results using the mpc controller in both figures the upper plot shows the reference set point data as black circles the simulator predictions as blue lines and the experimental results as red dashed lines plotted as a function of time the left axis is the testbed motor rotation in revolutions revs while the right axis shows the equivalent vertical heave motion of the ship assuming that a 16 inch 0 4046 m diameter winch drum is used to feed out cable for the ahc system since in both figs 11 and 12 the set point data predicted and actual system response are difficult to distinguish the middle plot in each figure shows the corresponding differences between the simulation and experimental reference tracking as a function of time while the bottom plot in each figure shows the difference between the simulation error signal and the experimental error signal referring to the pid controller results in fig 11 the simulator error signal standard deviation is 1 60 10 2 revs 2 04 cm which is very similar to the experimental error signal standard deviation of 1 88 10 2 revs 2 40 cm representing a difference of less than 8 mm 4 mm furthermore the computer simulator also accurately captures the individual fluctuations observed in the experimental error signal as a function of time fig 12 on the other hand shows reasonable agreement between the simulator and experimental reference tracking results using an mpc controller the simulator error signal standard deviation is 2 83 10 2 revs while the experimental error standard deviation is 1 30 10 2 revs comparing the bottom plot in figs 12 and 11 it can be seen that the discrepancy between simulation and experiment is significantly larger for mpc than for pid given the excellent agreement between simulation and experiment with pid control the observed difference with mpc is likely due to the way mpc is implemented in the optimization methods functions within the software packages used the experiments used labview while the simulations used matlab simulink figs 13 and 14 summarize the experimental and simulation error signal standard deviations for all four test cases using pid and mpc respectively in these figures the black bars correspond to the experimental results while the white bars correspond to the simulation results referring to the pid results shown in fig 13 the experimental and simulation error signal standard deviations are on average within 20 of each other confirming that the simulator model is indeed a good representation of the experimental system comparing figs 13 and 14 it should be noted that a larger discrepancy exists in the standard deviation of the error signal over all four test cases when mpc is used instead of pid again suggesting a different implementation of mpc within the two different software packages used in this research referring to fig 9 however it should be recalled that for the cases studied in this research mpc outperforms the pid controller the discussion pertaining to figs 13 and 14 only pertains to how accurately the simulator was able to predict the error signal of the system when mpc and pid control are implemented 8 loaded simulator given that the experimental testbed did not have the capability of applying a load to the system the computer simulator was used instead to test the performance of pid and mpc control in the presence of a load fig 15 shows the simulation motion results using mpc control to track the benchmark case when applying a constant 8890 n 2000 lbf load to the winch drum cable in an ideal perfect control system the application of a load would not affect the resulting motion of the system the upper plot of fig 15 shows the angular drum position as a function of time for the loaded and unloaded simulator with the equivalent heave motion shown on the right hand vertical axis the middle plot shows the reference tracking error for the loaded and unloaded simulator while the lower plot shows the difference between these two tracking error curves it can be seen from the middle plot of fig 15 that the loaded case solid line generally lags slightly behind the unloaded case dashed line when the angular position in the top plot of fig 15 is decreasing corresponding to a negative angular velocity of the winch this lag occurs when the winch is hauling in the cable and is due to a higher system pressure during the haul in operations which increases the amount of hydraulic fluid loss due to leakage and reduces the amount of fluid available to move the load the system model used by the mpc controller was identified using an unloaded winch this model does not account for pressure related fluid leakage therefore the mpc controller does not correct for the reduced speed from the leakage observed during the hauling in operations moreover there are inherent challenges and risks with identifying a winch motor model with a load attached referring to fig 16 however the pid controller showed no significant difference between the loaded and unloaded cases given this observation the present authors hypothesised that the addition of a proportional integral pi controller in parallel with mpc could account for the fluid leakage and effectively remove the offset observed with the simulated loaded mpc system in fig 15 thus allowing for one to identify an unloaded model of the winch for the mpc controller and still obtain the improved tracking when the system is loaded 8 1 loaded mpc pi controller implementation d ruscio di ruscio 2013 explains that the standard formulation of a mpc controller will not often achieve integral control as it is not an optimal action the mpc is attempting to obtain the optimal control action many researcher have proposed alterative formulations by adding an integrator to the input or disturbance signals mayne et al 2000 alternatively d ruscio di ruscio 2013 di ruscio 2012 applied a form of integral control with an mpc via a linear quadratic optimal controller the current authors believe that a simple pi controller could account for a motor leakage when the system is loaded and be assessable by industrial users and maritime operators of the proposed methodology to test the mpc pi hypothesis fig 17 shows how the pi controller was placed in parallel with the existing mpc controller such that both controllers acted on the same error signal and their corresponding control outputs were superimposed referring to equation 3 the new pi controller used the same proportional and integral gains as the author s pid controller while the mpc controller remained unchanged fig 18 compares the simulation results of this new mpc pi control scheme with the unloaded benchmark case and shows that the tracking error falls within 4 86 10 3 revs 6 2 mm 68 2 of the time for the unloaded case and 4 94 10 3 revs 6 3 mm 68 2 of the time for the loaded case the bottom plot of fig 18 is the error difference between the loaded and unloaded scenario for the mpc pi controller this plot shows that the theoretical discrepancy between the loaded and unloaded mpc pi controller has a standard deviation of only 3 19e 3 revs 4 mm which is even smaller by about a factor of two than that observed using pid control based on the standard deviation metrics mpc pi result suggest that one could expect decoupling efficiency to reach 1 3774 4 94 10 3 1 3774 100 99 6 the near perfect decoupling observed with mpc combined with a set point previewing algorithm in parallel with a pi controller is consistent with hatleskog and dunnigan 2007 who pointed out that a predictive controller may be helpful for an ahc system to approach 100 decoupling fig 19 summarizes the standard deviation of the tracking error signal results of the mpc pid and mpc pi control systems for both the loaded and unloaded simulation cases the figure shows that the new mpc pi controller outperforms the mpc and pid controllers in every instance by on average 65 the simulations suggest that one can tune the mpc and pi controllers independently allowing for a user to use common tuning techniques further work will need to be carried out on physical hardware under loaded conditions to further test this new mpc pi control approach 9 conclusion this work presents an ahc experimental testbed that uses a common hydraulic 4 way 3 position proportional valve to drive a hydraulic motor on an open loop hydraulic circuit the inherent hysteresis with this valve was corrected using a dither signal while the deadband and non linear gain associated with this valve were overcome in software such that the nonlinear valve and motor system appeared linear to the pid and mpc controllers a corresponding mathematical model of the ahc testbed was identified and used with a heave prediction mpc controller to actuate the unloaded full scale ahc testbed for the benchmark case and three additional test cases the heave prediction mpc controller performed better than a tuned pid controller although mpc requires a mathematical model of the system which may be difficult to identify accurately due to signal noise and nonlinearities the authors observed that for the conditions used in this research mpc was very robust to model uncertainty for example if a first order system model has corner frequencies identified within 40 of the actual value then the mpc tracking ability was found to be minimally affected in the extreme a corner frequency reduced by a factor of ten led to unacceptable tracking results for all cases while a corner frequency increased by a factor of ten showed reasonable tracking for relatively slow heave motions without any high frequency components mpc and pid control was then implemented on a computer simulator of the ahc testbed the pid controller simulation results of the error signal estimates were on average within 20 of the experimental results for the standard deviation metric used to quantify the results in this research the discrepancies observed when comparing the mpc controller simulation results with experimental data are likely due to different implementations of mpc within the different software packages used in this research applying a load within the simulator and tracking the test case motions with mpc shows that motor leakage due to the high load pressure causes the loaded system motion to lag behind the unloaded system motion to overcome this issue a new parallel mpc pi control scheme was implemented on the simulator the new mpc pi system used the same model and gains as the original mpc and pid controllers simulation results showed that this mpc pi controller was able to correct for the motor leakage and outperform the basic mpc and pid controllers by an average of 65 acknowledgements the authors would like to thank rolls royce canada limited and the atlantic canada opportunities agency acoa

23571,installation of blades for wind turbines is challenging due to large lifting height and high precision assessment of blade dynamic responses during installation needs advanced simulation tools which are limited at present this paper aims at developing an integrated simulation tool simo aero for single blade installation for both onshore and offshore wind turbines based on the cross flow principle the aerodynamic model is established by accounting for the effect of wind turbulence and dynamic stall then it is coupled with simo to achieve the integrated simulation tool simo aero which can account for blade aerodynamics vessel hydrodynamics and system mechanical couplings the aerodynamic code is verified by code to code comparisons with hawc2 furthermore simo aero is applied in case studies on the wind induced dynamic responses of a dtu 10 mw blade during installation using a jack up crane vessel which is assumed to be rigid including the crane and rigidly fixed to the seabed the characteristics of system dynamic responses prior to mating the blade onto the hub are studied it is shown that the blade motions are dominated by the pendulum motion critical parameters of the installation process are identified the extreme responses of critical parameters are further studied under turbulent winds and wind gusts keywords wind turbine blade installation fully coupled method extreme response 1 introduction in recent years air pollution and global warming have become important issues to the world leading to an urgent need of clean renewable and reliable energy sources such as wind energy the wind industry has grown significantly in the last decades the global cumulative installed wind capacity reached 487gw by the end of 2016 which includes about 14 4gw installed offshore global wind energy council 2017 at the same time the size of wind turbines also increases fast in 2016 8mw wind turbines were successfully installed at burbo bank offshore wind farm dong energy 2016 the trend towards larger turbine size leads to larger blade size higher installation height and increased sensitivity to wind condition and also wave condition for offshore turbines which adds difficulties to the installation of turbine components especially the blades the three most commonly used methods for blade installation are respectively single blade installation bunny ear and whole rotor lift uraz 2011 among those single blade installation is most frequently used for offshore installation in recent years due to small deck space requirement and flexible blade orientations during installation ahn et al 2017 during the installation process the blade is lifted and installed in a feathered position which is kept during the whole installation operation kuijken 2015 siemens 2014b high wind nv 2015 as shown in fig 1 the single blade can be installed in various orientations such as horizontal vertical or even inclined for inclined blade installation longer crane boom is required as the blade needs to be lifted higher than the hub height the vertical orientated installation needs to rotate the blade prior to installation since it is horizontally stored on the vessel deck which makes the process more complex the horizontal orientation installation is most preferred since no rotation of blade is required besides installations of blades for offshore wind turbines are commonly conducted by jack up crane vessels rather than floating ones since they provide a very stable working platform wind condition is the one of the main constraints for blade installation wind turbines since it directly affects the waiting time for suitable weather window which causes large economic cost by now most of the lifting equipment for single blade installation can operate under wind speed of 10 m s there are also advanced installation equipment such as blade dragon liftra 2012 b75 lifting yoke siemens 2014a and boom lock high wind nv 2015 the blade dragon which is shown in fig 1 b 1 c has a remote control system and can install blades with all orientations it claims that installation of blades can take place at a speed below 12 m s the b75 lifting yoke in fig 2 a is claimed to be capable of installing blades in average wind speed up to 14 m s it has automatic sling connection and can actively yaw itself to adjust the blade position during installation the boom lock in fig 2 b is a system mounted on crane boom to control the blade movement which is claimed to allow installation of blades in average wind speed up to 15 m s since the installation of blades for wind turbines is challenging it is of importance to establish and use advanced numerical simulation tools to study the dynamic response of blade during installation the dynamic response could be further used to predict the available weather windows if the installation criteria are known however so far a limited number of studies on blade installations for wind turbines have been published some studies focus on the aerodynamic modeling of blades during installation or under standstill conditions the characteristics of aerodynamic loads acting on a blade under installation conditions are quite different from a blade of an operating wind turbine wang et al 2014 studied the hoisting forces on a wind turbine blade during installation using computational fluid dynamics cfd under constant wind conditions gaunaa et al 2016 assessed the performance of cross flow principle on the dtu 10mw reference blade in standstill situations using extensive three dimensional cfd calculations the authors concluded that the cross flow principle gives a good estimation of aerodynamic loading when the blade pitch angle is within 50 50 these cfd analyses specialize in accurate estimation of aerodynamic loads based on solving navier stokes equations however they require significant computational efforts and cost thus it is not suitable for simulation of marine operations others focus on the installation process of blades for wind turbines wang et al 2012 studied the hoisting force of a 1 5mw wind turbine rotor using bladed gl garrad hassan 2010 gaunaa et al 2014 proposed a general scaling method regarding the mean and standard deviations of aerodynamic loads on a single blade in yawed and pitched wind conditions kuijken 2015 examined possible ways to improve single blade installation in higher wind speed using hawc2 larsen and hansen 2015 however bladed and hawc2 are designed to calculate time domain responses for wind turbine systems which are already in operation moreover they cannot provide accurate models for mechanical couplings such as lift wires slings and tugger lines which are of great importance in the modeling of blade installation for wind turbines therefore more sophisticated simulation tools for analysis of blade installation for wind turbines should be developed in this paper a novel coupled simulation tool simo aero is developed for wind turbine blade installation in which an aerodynamic code is fully coupled with simo a software specialized in numerical simulation of marine operations the aerodynamic modeling is firstly described considering the effect of turbulent wind inflow and dynamic stall then the aerodynamic code is coupled with simo to establish the integrated simulation tool simo aero simo aero is similar to simo riflex aerodyn kvittem et al 2012 and simo riflex ac cheng et al 2016 which are fully coupled simulation tools integrating an external aerodynamic model with simo and riflex for time domain simulations of offshore wind turbine systems during installation the simo aero proposed in this paper can be used to study the dynamic responses of single blade installation system for both onshore and offshore installations moreover it has great potential to develop more efficient methods for installation or removal of blades for offshore wind turbines using a floating crane vessel the aerodynamic code in the integrated simulation tool is verified against hawc2 results using the dtu 10mw reference wind turbine blade bak et al 2013 the developed simulation tool is applied in a series of load cases to study the characteristics of wind induced dynamic responses of the blade installation system in turbulent winds and extreme operating gust winds 2 aerodynamic modeling in this section the aerodynamic modeling of a single blade is presented based on the cross flow principle before going into details of the aerodynamic model the coordinate systems used in the modeling are clearly defined 2 1 reference frame as shown in fig 3 three coordinate systems were used i e the global coordinate system o x y z body fixed coordinate system for the blade o x y z and local airfoil blade cross section coordinate system o c x c y c z c which are all right handed coordinate systems the origin o of the blade body fixed coordinate is located at the blade center of gravity cog the y axis is in the spanwise direction and x axis is positive towards the trialling edge while z axis follows the right hand rule the instantaneous rotational motions of the blade around x y and z axis are respectively roll ϕ pitch θ and yaw ψ when ϕ θ and ψ are all zero o x y z parallels with the global coordinate o x y z the y c axis of the local airfoil coordinate coincides with the y axis while the x c axis is along the chord line given a vector represented by l g in the global coordinate system its representation in the blade body fixed coordinate system is 1 l b t g b l g furthermore the representation of l b in the local airfoil coordinate system is 2 l c t b c l b where t g b and t b c are the coordinate transformation matrix the t g b is a function of instantaneous blade rotational motion ϕ θ ψ while t b c is a function of structural twist angle of blade local cross sections the transformation matrix from the global coordinate to the local airfoil coordinate t g c is 3 t g c t b c t g b 2 2 cross flow principle in the aerodynamic force calculation the blade is divided into a number of elements for each element the calculation of aerodynamic loads is based on the cross flow principle horner 1965 hoerner and borst 1985 which has been widely used in wind energy industry in the cross flow principle the inflow velocity normal to the cross section is neglected as shown in fig 4 thus the component of relative inflow velocity v a i on y c axis is neglected i e 4 v r e l v a i x c 0 v a i z c t where v a i x c and v a i z c are respectively the projection of v a i on axis x c and y c this principle is applicable for calculation of aerodynamic forces on a wind turbine blade where the local blade element suits a 2d approximation the characteristics of v r e l for an element on a lifted blade are quite different from that on a rotating one for an element a rotating blade the large rotational speed has a significant contribution to v r e l however the v r e l for an element on a lifted blade is mainly from the inflow wind velocity it leads to significant discrepancies in aerodynamic loading on the whole blade the overall difference in aerodynamic load between a lifted blade and a rotating blade is further discussed in section 6 1 2 3 calculation of aerodynamic forces fig 5 shows a flow diagram for calculating the aerodynamic load on a lifted blade the instantaneous displacement and velocity of the blade are respectively x b x t y t z t θ t ψ t t and v b v x t v y t v z t v ϕ t v θ t v ψ t t at each time step the whole blade is divided into a number of elements the total force on the blade is the sum of those on all elements for each element its instantaneous position and velocity in the global coordinate system is calculated 5 x i x b 1 3 t g b t t r i b 6 v i v b 1 3 v b 4 6 t g b t t r i b where x i x i t y i t z i t t and v i v x i t v y i t v z i t t r i b is the position vector of element i in the blade body fixed coordinate based on the global position of the i t h element the wind inflow velocity at this element could be obtained i e v w g i the corresponding relative inflow velocity v a i in the local airfoil coordinate can be derived from 7 v a i t g c i v w g i v i v i g i the v i g is the wake induced velocity it is significant for a rotating blade with large rotational speed however it has marginal influence for blades during installation because the blade motion is very small therefore it is neglected here afterwards the relative velocity v r e l used for further aerodynamic calculation is obtained using v a i based on the cross flow principle which was discussed in detail in section 2 2 then the angle of attack α is determined it is used to calculate the lift coefficient c l and drag coefficient c d based on a 2d look up table the table gives the relationship between c l c d and α based on the calculated c l and c d coefficients for each element the aerodynamic lift drag force are calculated furthermore the aerodynamic forces on the whole blade are obtained as the sum of those on all elements the total aerodynamic forces are given in the global coordinate system at blade cog moreover there is an option to include dynamic stall effect before the table look up the beddoes leishman dynamic stall model is used which is explained in the next section 2 4 beddoes leishman stall model the beddoes leishman dynamic stall model was originally proposed by leishman and beddoes 1989 for helicopter aerodynamics later gupta and leishman 2006 adapted it for application in wind turbine aerodynamics as shown on the right side of fig 5 there are three parts in the beddoes leishman dynamic stall model i e unsteady attached flow unsteady separated flow and dynamic vortex lift in the unsteady attached flow regime the aerodynamic loading consists of a circulatory and an impulsive part the circulatory component is due to the change of angle of attack while the impulsive component is related to the change rate of α and pitch moment furthermore the attached flow results are modified due to flow separation on the low pressure side of the airfoil including leading edge and trailling edge separations the final part of the model is the vortex build up and shedding the vortex lift contribution is empirically modeled as an excess circulation in the vicinity of the airfoil using the difference between the normal force coefficient c n from attached flow and separated flow the total loading on the airfoil is the sum of the aforementioned components 2 5 inflow wind the developed simulation tool can account for steady wind turbulent wind and gust wind the steady wind is constant in time and space the turbulent wind is described by the iec kaimal model iec 2005 for the turbulent wind the three dimensional full field wind file is generated by using the nrel s turbsim program jonkman 2009 the extreme operating gust wind is defined according to iec 6400 1 iec 2005 the effects of wind shear is considered in the inflow wind the wind shear effect is described by the power law wind profile i e 8 v z v z r e f z z r e f α s where v z is the wind speed at height z while v z r e f is the wind speed at reference height z which is normally the hub height in addition α s is the wind shear exponent iec 2009 the wind yaw angle ψ w is defined as the angle between the wind inflow direction and the global x axis in o x y plane it is positive in the anticlockwise direction as shown in fig 6 the wind flows along the positive global x axis when ψ w is zero 3 development of the integrated simulation tool the developed aerodynamic code is coupled with simo marintek 2015a b to formulate the integrated simulation tool simo aero for blade installation simo is widely used in time domain simulations of marine operations in the offshore oil gas and renewable energy industries it could be used to simulate dynamic loads and responses for onshore foundations and offshore jack up crane vessels or floating vessels the coupled simo aero code could account for aerodynamics of the installed blade hydrodynamics of the installation vessel and mechanical couplings between bodies in the multi body system the simo aero code developed in this paper is a fully coupled code as shown in fig 7 the instantaneous blade displacement and velocity in the global coordinate system is calculated by simo at each time step the instantaneous displacement is used to update the transformation matrix from global to local blade element coordinate systems then the blade velocity and wind inflow velocity in the global coordinate system are transferred into the local blade element coordinate system to update the relative velocity seen by the local blade element and the angle of attack the corresponding lift and drag coefficients are determined from a look up table and are used to estimate the lift and drag forces in the local blade element coordinate system these aerodynamic forces are then transferred into the global coordinate system and are sent back to simo to calculate the blade displacement and velocity for the next time step fig 8 shows the modeling of external loads and internal coupling for the blade installation system the system for blade installation usually consists of a crane vessel a hook a yoke and the blade to be installed the hook is connected to the crane via the lift wire four slings spread down from the hook to the yoke which holds the blade the blade and the yoke are modeled as one rigid body denoted by by two horizontal tugger lines run from the yoke to the crane boom in order to control the blade motions in the present paper the coupled simo aero code was applied in case studies with focus on the wind induced responses of the blade a jack up crane vessel which is assumed to be rigid and rigidly fixed to the seabed is used the wave load hydrostatic loads and current loads are all not considered for the jack up crane vessel 3 1 aerodynamic model the aerodynamic model is extensively described in section 2 it is based on the cross flow principle and accounts for the effect of turbulence and dynamic stall however there are still limitations in the aerodynamic model the dynamic inflow effect the wind loads on yoke and influence of yoke geometry on the flow field are assumed to be insignificant and not included for the case study presented later a straight blade is considered besides the blade is assumed to be rigid gaunaa et al 2014 studied the importance of structural flexibility for a wind turbine blade during installation using the dtu 10mw blade it was found that the influence of structural flexibility is negligible as long as the natural frequency of blade rigid body motion is below 2 51 rad s 0 4 hz the results in section 7 1 show that the natural frequency of blade rigid motion is 0 5 rad s which is well below 2 51 rad s thus the blade flexibility has minor effect on the dynamic response of the blade during the installation phase 3 2 mechanical coupling model the bodies involved in the blade installation system are coupled with each other via lift wire slings or tugger lines the coupling forces in the wires are modeled as linear spring forces zero compression 9 t k δ l t 0 where t is the wire tension and δ l is the wire elongation besides k is the axial stiffness of the wire which is given by 10 1 k l e a 1 k 0 where l and a are respectively the length and cross sectional area of the wire e the modulus elasticity of the material of the wire and 1 k 0 the connection flexibility 4 system description since jack up crane vessels are most commonly used for blade installations of offshore wind turbines a jack up crane vessel is used in the following case studies as shown in fig 9 the blade used in this study is the dtu 10mw reference wind turbine blade bak et al 2013 the hub height is 119 m above the mean sea surface the blade is considered to be straight which is 86 37 m long and weighs about 42 tons the blade cog is located 26 2 m from its root the blade is divided into 55 elements during the calculation of aerodynamic loads the corresponding chord length twist angle thickness and airfoil coefficients at each blade element are interpolated based on those described by bak et al 2013 a yoke weighting 47 tons is placed around the blade cog to hold the blade two horizontal tugger lines are deployed from the yoke to the crane structure both tugger lines are 3 m long and have an arm length of 10 m as shown in fig 9 table 1 is a summary of the system properties the detailed wire properties in the system are presented in table 2 the crane wire is a typical metal wire rope with diameter of 60 mm lankhorst ropes 2013 the flexibility of the lift wire is due to the deformation of the crane boom and wires from crane tip to crane winch the slings have a diameter of 30 mm while the diameter of the tugger lines is 5 mm in addition material damping in wire is included in the model which is about 1 of the wire stiffness according to the simo theory manual marintek 2015a 4 1 eigenvalue analysis eigenvalue analysis is conducted to evaluate the eigen periods of rigid body motions of the hook blade and yoke in the numerical model the blade and yoke are modeled as one body which is denoted by by the eigen periods and modes are obtained by solving eq 11 11 ω 2 m a k x 0 where m a and k are the mass added mass and restoring matrix of the by and hook since they are in air the added mass matrix a is zero in addition the restoring matrix k mainly comes from the gravity of involved bodies lift wire slings and tugger lines as shown in table 3 the by and hook coupled motions have 9 eigen modes the dominated motion s of each eigen mode is emphasized in bold the 1 s t mode has the largest eigen period 13 63s corresponding to the system pendulum motion in the blade local y b z b plane shown in fig 9 the 2 n d is dominated by the yaw motion of the by the 3 r d mode is a combination of transnational motions in the horizontal plane and rotational motion in the vertical plane the eigen periods of these two modes are much shorter due to the influence of the tugger lines the last 6 modes have short natural periods which are below 3s the first mode is the most important for the dynamics of the system as demonstrated by the spectral analysis of blade motion in section 7 1 5 load cases and environmental conditions a series of load cases are defined for code verification and time domain simulations as given in tables 4 and 5 it should be noted that these load cases are not from design codes but are only chosen for the numerical study in this paper however the largest turbulence intensity 15 72 in the load cases is chosen according to the design class c in iec 6400 1 iec 2005 load case lc1 is the steady wind case which is used to verify the aerodynamic code in load case lc2 turbulent wind is applied it is used to demonstrate the necessity of using an advanced aerodynamic model and how much inaccuracy a simplified aerodynamic model might cause as discussed in section 6 the simplification made means that blade velocity is neglected in the calculation of aerodynamic loads load case lc3 is a turbulent wind case with varying turbulence intensity t i lc3 is designed to study the characteristics of the blade installation system under turbulent wind condition including global motion of the blade aerodynamic loads acting on the blade and tension in crane wire and tugger lines turbulent wind is also used in load cases lc4 and lc5 while their initial blade pitch angles θ b are different from lc3 the θ b represents the initial orientation of blade relative to the horizontal plane lc4 and lc5 are used for comparison against lc3 to analyze the influence of blade pitch angle on two vital parameters during installation system i e the blade root motion and loads in tugger lines in load case lc6 the turbulence intensity t i is constant while the wind inflow angle ψ w varies from 0 to 75 the corresponding results show the influence of ψ w on the extreme responses in load case lc1 only one run with duration of 100s is conducted since the blade is fixed and the wind is steady however 50 runs are executed for each simulation with duration of 600s in the turbulent wind load cases lc2 lc6 the reason for using 10min as the simulation time is that the duration of mating the blade onto hub usually takes approximately 10min fifty runs are to ensure the robustness of the obtained statistics moreover 500s is used before the turbulent wind starts in each simulation to remove the transient effect due to simulation start up extreme operating gust wind eog represents rapid change in wind speed it is applied to study the dynamic responses of the blade installation system under sudden transient change of inflow wind speed table 5 lists the eog load cases load cases lc7 and lc8 have the same gust wind while their blade pitch angles θ b are different the purpose is to study the dynamic response of the blade installation system under extreme operating gust wind and the influence of θ b on the dynamic responses the wind speed of an eog is given as 12 v z t v z 0 37 v g u s t s i n 3 π t t g 1 c o s 2 π t t g for 0 t g v z otherwise where t g is the duration of wind gust i e 10 5 s iec 2005 besides v g u s t is the gust velocity at the hub height which is determined by the hub height wind speed etc in addition v z is the wind speed at height z which is determined by the wind shear effect and wind speed at hub height 6 verification of the coupled simulation tool verification of the coupled simulation tool is carried out module by module simo has been widely validated and used in the offshore oil gas and renewable energy industries therefore only verification of the aero code is carried out code to code comparison against hawc2 is conducted using the dtu 10mw reference wind turbine blade under load case lc1 fig 10 show the comparison of lift and drag force it is shown that the results from the developed code are in good accordance with the hawc2 results however it should be noted that this code to code comparison only verifies the aerodynamic code but does not validate the model against experimental data since they are very difficult to obtain fig 10 reveals the influence of blade pitch angle θ b 0 θ b 90 and wind yaw angle ψ w 120 ο ψ w 120 ο on the blade aerodynamic loads with the increase of θ b the aerodynamic lift force f z firstly experiences an increasing trend before θ b reaches 45 and then starts to decrease until θ b 90 however the aerodynamic drag force f x experiences a consistent increase until θ 90 at the mean time both f z and f x scale with the cosine function of ψ w the peak value of f x at ψ w 0 is over 30 k n which is 50 larger than the peak of f z at the same yaw angle the roll moment m x shown in fig 11 a shares the same trend with f z because it is the integration of lift force along the blade with an arm around the blade cog similar to f d the yaw moment m z increases until θ b reaches 90 6 1 comparison of aerodynamic force distribution on a lifted blade and a rotating blade the distribution of aerodynamic forces on a lifted blade is quite different from a rotating one fig 12 compares the lift and drag force distribution on a blade during rotation and lifted condition in lc1 the blade has zero initial pitch angle in both conditions besides the rotating blade has a rotational speed of 8 029 rpm as shown in fig 12 both lift and drag forces for the rotating blade experience an increasing trend towards the tip the aerodynamic center of the rotating blade stays close to the blade tip it indicates that the rotational speed plays an important role in the aerodynamic force distribution of a rotating blade for the lifted blade the main contribution of the aerodynamic loads comes from the middle and root part of the blade thus the aerodynamic center of a lifted blade is located close to the blade root compared to the inflow wind velocity the velocity of a lifted blade is insignificant fig 13 shows the aerodynamic distribution on a lifted blade with variation of blade pitch angle in lc1 the pink dense line fig 13 represents the blade cog while the dotted lines stands for the aerodynamic center at different θ b as shown in fig 13 a the aerodynamic center of lift force for θ b 0 is 20 m from the blade root then it moves to around 40 m from root at θ b 45 afterwards it moves back towards the blade root as θ b increases when the blade pitch angle is 90 the aerodynamic center of lift force is the same with zero pitch angle on the contrary the aerodynamic center of drag force consistently moves towards blade tip as θ b increases 6 2 influence of blade velocity on the system response in the current method for calculation of aerodynamic loads the velocity v i at blade elements due to blade motion i e v m g is taken into consideration as shown in eq 7 since the blade velocity is small compared with wind inflow velocity there might be thoughts to neglect the blade velocity bv in the aerodynamic load calculation in this section the influence of blade velocity in the aerodynamic load calculation is discussed approach with bv considering v i in the calculation of aerodynamic loads the relative inflow velocity in the local airfoil coordinate system is 13 v a i t g c i v w g i v i approach without bv neglecting v i in the calculation of aerodynamic loads the relative inflow velocity in the local airfoil coordinate system is 14 v a i t g c i v i in addition it should be noted that the instantaneous position of the blade is used in the coordinate transformation matrix t g c i in both approaches load case lc2 is used in the comparison of these two approaches the blade roll motion and aerodynamic roll moment on the blade are taken as examples in the comparison figs 14 and 15 respectively compare the time series and spectra of the blade roll motion and aerodynamic roll moment on the blade calculated based on approach with bv with consider blade velocity in the calculation of aerodynamic load and without bv without consider blade velocity in the calculation of aerodynamic load in lc2 with blade initial pitch angle θ b 0 as shown in fig 14 a and b neglecting the blade velocity during the calculation of aerodynamic loads leads to a marginal decrease of the amplitude of aerodynamic roll moment m x at ω 0 46 r a d s which is the resonant frequency of roll motion as a consequence neglecting the blade velocity leads to significant discrepancies in the blade motion as shown in fig 15 a and b similar trends are seen in the comparison of these two approaches in lc2 with blade initial pitch angle θ b 45 as shown in figs 16 and 17 however neglecting the blade velocity during the calculation of aerodynamic loads at θ b 45 leads to a much smaller difference in blade roll motion because the total aerodynamic roll moment on the blade at θ b 45 is less sensitive to the variation of angles of attack at all blade elements induced by neglecting the blade velocity than at θ b 0 even though the blade velocity has marginal impact on the amplitude of aerodynamic loads it is essential to include it in the aerodynamic load calculations since it plays an important role in terms of aerodynamic damping the blade motion is highly dominated by pendulum motion for which the damping is small thus the aerodynamic damping due to blade motion is crucial for the dynamic response of the blade when it is neglected the blade motion will be significantly overestimated 6 3 influence of tugger line arrangement on blade dynamic motion as mentioned in section 4 a representative value of the tugger line arm length 10 m relative to the blade cog was used which is also shown in fig 18 a to investigate the impact of tugger line arrangement on the dynamic characteristics of blade motion a shorter tugger line arm length i e 5 m was applied as illustrated in fig 18 b for comparison the results are shown in fig 19 as shown in fig 19 a and b the dynamic responses of blade sway and roll with tugger line arm length of 10 m are slightly smaller than that for the 5 m case however significant reduction of blade yaw motion is seen in fig 19 c by increase of the tugger line arm length from 5 m to 10 m that is because the tugger line arm length of 10 m increases the resonant frequency of blade yaw motion to a high level where resonant response is greatly reduced 7 results and discussions the developed coupled simulation tool simo aero is applied to study the wind induced dynamic response of the system prior to the mating process the characteristics of stochastic dynamic response of the blade installation system is analyzed the study is further extended by analyzing the extreme responses of the system under turbulent wind and extreme operating gust wind conditions 7 1 stochastic dynamic responses of the blade installation system in turbulent wind the global responses of the blade installation system in load case lc2 are studied in this section in load case lc3 the wind yaw angle ψ w and blade initial pitch angle θ b are both zero while the turbulence intensity t i of the inflow wind varies from 1 to 15 72 table 6 shows the mean values of the global responses such as blade motions aerodynamic loads on the blade and tensions in crane wire and tugger lines the non zero mean values of roll and yaw are respectively resulted from the aerodynamic roll and yaw moment the roll motion leads to difference of tension in tugger lines which causes the non zero blade sway motion the standard deviations stds of blade surge heave and pitch are not presented since they are almost zero the stds of blade sway roll and yaw with variation of wind turbulence intensity t i are shown in fig 20 a the blade roll motion is much larger than its yaw as mentioned in section 4 the tugger lines are deployed in the horizontal plane which control the blade yaw motion however constraints in the vertical plane are much weaker leading to significant blade roll motion moreover the stds of blade sway roll and yaw scale linearly with t i besides the std variation of aerodynamic loads and tensions in crane wire and tugger lines which are respectively shown in fig 20 b 20 d experience a similar linear trend over t i the linear scale relationship between system response and wind turbulence intensity can be expressed as 15 σ s w a y σ r o l l σ y a w σ f x 0 σ f z σ m x 0 σ m z σ f c w σ f t u g 1 σ f t u g 2 t i a where a is a matrix of the scale parameters which are determined by the inflow wind characteristics and properties of the blade such as mean wind speed density of air aerodynamic and structural properties of the blade etc this indicates that the stds of blade motions aerodynamic loads and wire tensions are proportional to the wind turbulent intensity it agrees with and further extends one of the conclusions in ref gaunaa et al 2014 the agreed conclusion is that the aerodynamic loading on a lifted blade is proportional to t i in lc2 a is found to be 16 a 0 0026 0 0071 0 0008 0 0365 0 0 1029 1 1376 0 0 6176 0 1018 0 0842 0 0980 furthermore spectral analysis for blade motions is conducted particularly for sway roll and yaw motions as shown in fig 21 all of the three spectra have a peak around ω 0 46 r a d s the corresponding peak period is approximately 13 63 s which is the natural period of the 1 s t mode of the system rigid body motion shown in table 3 it indicates that the pendulum motion dominates the system responses besides the yaw spectrum has other two small peaks between ω 1 5 r a d s and ω 2 0 r a d s which are respectively the eigen periods of the 7th and 8th modes shown in table 3 moreover the spectrum peaks also increase with increasing turbulence intensity which indicates that the blade motion is larger at higher turbulent intensity 7 2 stochastic motion response at blade root in turbulent wind the blade root displacement relative to the hub position can be expressed as 17 δ x δ y δ z t x x 0 y y 0 z z 0 t where x 0 y 0 and z 0 are the position of hub center fig 22 shows an example of the time series of blade root displacements and velocities it is shown that the surge motion at blade root is the smallest while the heave motion is the largest the horizontal tugger lines provide significant restoring in surge however the restoring in sway and heave relies on the slings and crane wires which are quite limited moreover the spectral analysis for motions at blade root is conducted as shown in fig 23 the heave spectrum at blade root shown in fig 23 c has the largest values which is due to the significant blade roll motion the surge spectrum at blade root in fig 23 a has a similar trend with the blade yaw spectrum in fig 21 c this indicates that the surge motion at blade root is mainly resulted from the blade yaw motion the amplitude in sway spectrum at blade root in fig 23 b is very close to the amplitude of blade sway spectrum in fig 21 a it indicates that the blade rotational motions have marginal contribution to the sway motion at blade root compared with blade sway 7 3 extreme response in turbulent wind in this section the extreme values of critical parameters in the lifting system during the blade mating process are studied for the mating process of the blade onto hub the blade root motion in the x z plane is very critical if the blade root motion in x z plane is too large the blade cannot be mated onto the hub in this study the blade root motion in the x z plane is denoted as r r o o t 18 r r o o t δ x 2 δ z 2 the sway motion at blade root is also important because it might lead to destructive collisions the sway motion at blade root is expressed as 19 y r o o t δ y besides the sway velocity at blade root is denoted as v y r o o t the tension in crane wire is not considered as a critical parameter since it has small variation from its mean value the extreme tension in tugger lines f t u g is considered to be critical as it adds extra force and moment to the crane boom 7 3 1 extreme value estimation the extreme values in this study are calculated based on the mean up crossing rate method naess and moan 2012 in this method it is assumed that the high threshold up crossings are statistically independent thus a poisson probability distribution can be applied for the extreme values let m t m a x y t 0 t t denotes the extreme value for a random process y t over the duration of t if the process is stationary the corresponding probability of exceedance for extreme values is given by 20 p m t y 1 e x p v y t where v y is the mean up crossing rate the sample estimated mean value of v y can be calculated from simulated time series 21 v ˆ y 1 k t j 1 k n j y t where n j y t represents the number of up crossings at level y of the j t h time history during 0 t besides k is the number of time series with enough number of time series a good approximation of 95 confidence interval ci can be obtained i e 22 c i y v ˆ y 1 96 s ˆ y k eq 21 22 are the basics for the empirical estimation of the mean upcrossing rate from direct numerical simulations i e monte carlo simulation however direct numerical simulations are very time consuming especially for low probability levels chai et al 2015 to be more time efficient an extrapolation technique is applied naess and gaidai 2008 the 10 min extreme values are studied with 3 3 probability of exceedence which corresponds to occur once within 300min according to dnv rp h103 standard det norske veritas 2011 the corresponding mean upcrossing rate is 5 593 10 5 fifty time series are used for the extreme value estimation of each sub case fig 24 a and b present two examples of the fitting and extrapolation 7 3 2 effects of turbulence intensity the influence of wind turbulence intensity t i on the system extreme responses is studied in this section load cases lc3 lc4 and lc5 are used the turbulence intensity t i varies within each load case while the blade initial pitch angle θ b increases from 0 in lc3 to 45 in lc5 fig 25 shows the results specifically fig 25 a shows the extremes of r r o o t fig 25 b and c present respectively the extreme sway displacement y r o o t and velocity v y r o o t at blade root fig 25 d shows the extreme tension in tugger lines f t u g similar to the standard deviations of the system response in section 7 1 the system extreme responses also increase linearly with increasing t i at the same time the extreme responses experience a non linear increasing trend with the increase of θ b the extreme responses at θ b 0 is small a dramatic increase occurs when θ b increases to 30 in lc4 the extreme responses at θ b 45 in lc5 reach their respective peak values the variation trend over θ b is similar to that of the aerodynamic forces and moments shown in figs 10 and 11 take the extreme values of r r o o t as an example the extreme value of r r o o t at t i 15 72 is over three times larger than the corresponding extreme at t i 5 besides the extreme value of r r o o t also varies a lot with increasing blade pitch angle at t i 15 72 the extreme value of r r o o t increases over two times when θ b increases from 0 to 45 compared with r r o o t the extreme value of y r o o t is slightly smaller at large pitch angle the extreme value of v y r o o t is significant this indicates that large blade pitch angle makes it more difficult to mate the blade onto hub and increases the chance of blade root collision with hub 7 3 3 effects of wind direction fig 26 a shows the influence of wind yaw angle ψ b on the extreme responses of the system using load case lc6 six yaw angles are simulated varying between 0 and 75 it is shown that all the extreme responses are linear functions of the cosine functions of ψ b the fitted line is presented as the blue curve in fig 26 a it is shown that the system extreme responses decrease with increasing wind yaw angle this indicates that larger wind yaw angle makes the mating operation of a blade onto hub easier 7 4 stochastic dynamic response of the system in extreme operating gust wind the influence of extreme operating wind gust on the dynamic response of the system is studied in this section as shown in fig 27 different blade initial pitch angles θ b are applied i e 0 in lc7 and 45 in lc8 the same gust wind is used for both cases the gust wind inflow angle ψ b is zero and the mean wind speed is 10 m s fig 27 b shows the time series of the gust wind speed the wind gust starts at 300s and ends at 310 5s the other graphs in fig 27 show the blade root motion and aerodynamic loading on the blade to have a better illustration of the response time series between 290s and 350 is presented as shown in fig 27 b and c the aerodynamic loads on the blade follow the gust wind simultaneously compared with lc7 the aerodynamic loads in lc8 have a much larger peak nevertheless the aerodynamic loads in both cases become stable after the gust wind ends which indicates that the aerodynamic loads on a lifted blade are mainly dominated by inflow wind velocity however compared with the blade aerodynamic loads the motion responses at blade root experience a different trend as shown in fig 27 d 27 f the blade root motions fluctuate a lot moreover much larger fluctuations are seen by blade root motion in lc8 the fluctuation of blade root surge motion δ x is dominated by two cycles which agrees with the spectrum of blade root surge motion in fig 23 a apparently the sway δ y and heave δ z motions at blade root fluctuate with the natural frequency of the 1 s t eigen mode shown in fig 23 b and c the maximum responses of blade root motions are listed in table 7 in load case lc7 the maximum values of r r o o t y r o o t and v y r o o t are all very small nevertheless in lc8 the maximum values of r r o o t and y r o o t are respectively 0 43 m and 0 33 m compared with results in fig 25 the maximum responses in the extreme operating gust wind are equivalent to the extreme responses under turbulent wind with turbulence intensity of 7 8 conclusions this paper deals with the development verification and application of an integrated simulation tool for modeling and dynamic analysis of single blade installation for wind turbines on the basis of cross flow principle an aerodynamic code denoted as aero code is developed considering the effect of wind turbulence extreme operating gusts and dynamic stall the developed aero code is then coupled with simo to formulate the integrated simulation tool i e simo aero code the coupled simo aero code could be used to evaluate the system performance during single blade installation for offshore as well as onshore wind turbines accounting for aerodynamics hydrodynamics and wire coupling mechanics verification of the simulation tool is conducted module by module simo has been widely verified and used the aero code is verified by code to code comparisons against hawc2 results it is shown that the aero code gives accurate estimation of the aerodynamic loads the characteristics of aerodynamic loads on a lifted blade are quite different from a rotating one for a lifted blade the main contributions of aerodynamic loads come from the middle and root part of the blade furthermore the aerodynamic damping is of great importance in the dynamic response of blade during installation the developed integrated simulation tool is then applied to simulate the wind induced dynamic responses of a dtu 10mw reference wind turbine blade prior to mating using a jack up crane vessel stochastic dynamic analysis reveals the characteristics of the blade installation system the blade motions are dominated by pendulum motions sway and roll motion of the blade are significant leading to large sway and heave motion at the blade root furthermore the system critical responses are identified which are respectively blade root surge and heave motion displacement and velocity of root sway and tension in tugger lines moreover the critical responses are further studied in turbulent wind and gust wind the results indicate that a larger wind yaw angle and a smaller blade pitch angle ease the difficulty of mating the blade onto the hub besides installing a blade under extreme operating gust wind is less difficult than in strong turbulent wind the horizontally deployed tugger lines are commonly used in offshore blade installation however they do not provide enough constraints in the lateral and vertical directions leading to significant blade root motions in sway and heave to reduce motions at blade root increasing damping in the tugger lines or adjusting tugger line configurations might help besides a yoke with automatic motion compensation is expected to have a better control of motions at the blade root moreover the blade root motion is highly sensitive to the initial pitch angle of the blade wind turbulence intensity and wind direction during the planning and operational phases of offshore wind turbine blade installation these factors are recommended to be considered together with the mean wind speed in this way the offshore blade installation could be conducted safely economically and more efficiently 9 future work in this study the jack up crane vessel including the crane were assumed to be rigid and rigidly fixed to the seabed in reality the crane tip of the jack up crane vessel moves due to the motion of the jack up vessel under wave loads and the deformation of the crane at large lifting height this movement has some impacts on the dynamic response of the blade during installation a future study will be conducted to evaluate the influence of wave induced loads on the jack up crane vessel and deformation of the jack up crane vessel and the crane on the dynamic behavior of the blade during installation study on blade installation by a floating crane vessel is also to be conducted by using the developed simulation tool in the future it is expected to be favored by the offshore wind industry due to the rapid development of offshore wind energy acknowledgment the authors appreciate the support from the department of marine technology

23571,installation of blades for wind turbines is challenging due to large lifting height and high precision assessment of blade dynamic responses during installation needs advanced simulation tools which are limited at present this paper aims at developing an integrated simulation tool simo aero for single blade installation for both onshore and offshore wind turbines based on the cross flow principle the aerodynamic model is established by accounting for the effect of wind turbulence and dynamic stall then it is coupled with simo to achieve the integrated simulation tool simo aero which can account for blade aerodynamics vessel hydrodynamics and system mechanical couplings the aerodynamic code is verified by code to code comparisons with hawc2 furthermore simo aero is applied in case studies on the wind induced dynamic responses of a dtu 10 mw blade during installation using a jack up crane vessel which is assumed to be rigid including the crane and rigidly fixed to the seabed the characteristics of system dynamic responses prior to mating the blade onto the hub are studied it is shown that the blade motions are dominated by the pendulum motion critical parameters of the installation process are identified the extreme responses of critical parameters are further studied under turbulent winds and wind gusts keywords wind turbine blade installation fully coupled method extreme response 1 introduction in recent years air pollution and global warming have become important issues to the world leading to an urgent need of clean renewable and reliable energy sources such as wind energy the wind industry has grown significantly in the last decades the global cumulative installed wind capacity reached 487gw by the end of 2016 which includes about 14 4gw installed offshore global wind energy council 2017 at the same time the size of wind turbines also increases fast in 2016 8mw wind turbines were successfully installed at burbo bank offshore wind farm dong energy 2016 the trend towards larger turbine size leads to larger blade size higher installation height and increased sensitivity to wind condition and also wave condition for offshore turbines which adds difficulties to the installation of turbine components especially the blades the three most commonly used methods for blade installation are respectively single blade installation bunny ear and whole rotor lift uraz 2011 among those single blade installation is most frequently used for offshore installation in recent years due to small deck space requirement and flexible blade orientations during installation ahn et al 2017 during the installation process the blade is lifted and installed in a feathered position which is kept during the whole installation operation kuijken 2015 siemens 2014b high wind nv 2015 as shown in fig 1 the single blade can be installed in various orientations such as horizontal vertical or even inclined for inclined blade installation longer crane boom is required as the blade needs to be lifted higher than the hub height the vertical orientated installation needs to rotate the blade prior to installation since it is horizontally stored on the vessel deck which makes the process more complex the horizontal orientation installation is most preferred since no rotation of blade is required besides installations of blades for offshore wind turbines are commonly conducted by jack up crane vessels rather than floating ones since they provide a very stable working platform wind condition is the one of the main constraints for blade installation wind turbines since it directly affects the waiting time for suitable weather window which causes large economic cost by now most of the lifting equipment for single blade installation can operate under wind speed of 10 m s there are also advanced installation equipment such as blade dragon liftra 2012 b75 lifting yoke siemens 2014a and boom lock high wind nv 2015 the blade dragon which is shown in fig 1 b 1 c has a remote control system and can install blades with all orientations it claims that installation of blades can take place at a speed below 12 m s the b75 lifting yoke in fig 2 a is claimed to be capable of installing blades in average wind speed up to 14 m s it has automatic sling connection and can actively yaw itself to adjust the blade position during installation the boom lock in fig 2 b is a system mounted on crane boom to control the blade movement which is claimed to allow installation of blades in average wind speed up to 15 m s since the installation of blades for wind turbines is challenging it is of importance to establish and use advanced numerical simulation tools to study the dynamic response of blade during installation the dynamic response could be further used to predict the available weather windows if the installation criteria are known however so far a limited number of studies on blade installations for wind turbines have been published some studies focus on the aerodynamic modeling of blades during installation or under standstill conditions the characteristics of aerodynamic loads acting on a blade under installation conditions are quite different from a blade of an operating wind turbine wang et al 2014 studied the hoisting forces on a wind turbine blade during installation using computational fluid dynamics cfd under constant wind conditions gaunaa et al 2016 assessed the performance of cross flow principle on the dtu 10mw reference blade in standstill situations using extensive three dimensional cfd calculations the authors concluded that the cross flow principle gives a good estimation of aerodynamic loading when the blade pitch angle is within 50 50 these cfd analyses specialize in accurate estimation of aerodynamic loads based on solving navier stokes equations however they require significant computational efforts and cost thus it is not suitable for simulation of marine operations others focus on the installation process of blades for wind turbines wang et al 2012 studied the hoisting force of a 1 5mw wind turbine rotor using bladed gl garrad hassan 2010 gaunaa et al 2014 proposed a general scaling method regarding the mean and standard deviations of aerodynamic loads on a single blade in yawed and pitched wind conditions kuijken 2015 examined possible ways to improve single blade installation in higher wind speed using hawc2 larsen and hansen 2015 however bladed and hawc2 are designed to calculate time domain responses for wind turbine systems which are already in operation moreover they cannot provide accurate models for mechanical couplings such as lift wires slings and tugger lines which are of great importance in the modeling of blade installation for wind turbines therefore more sophisticated simulation tools for analysis of blade installation for wind turbines should be developed in this paper a novel coupled simulation tool simo aero is developed for wind turbine blade installation in which an aerodynamic code is fully coupled with simo a software specialized in numerical simulation of marine operations the aerodynamic modeling is firstly described considering the effect of turbulent wind inflow and dynamic stall then the aerodynamic code is coupled with simo to establish the integrated simulation tool simo aero simo aero is similar to simo riflex aerodyn kvittem et al 2012 and simo riflex ac cheng et al 2016 which are fully coupled simulation tools integrating an external aerodynamic model with simo and riflex for time domain simulations of offshore wind turbine systems during installation the simo aero proposed in this paper can be used to study the dynamic responses of single blade installation system for both onshore and offshore installations moreover it has great potential to develop more efficient methods for installation or removal of blades for offshore wind turbines using a floating crane vessel the aerodynamic code in the integrated simulation tool is verified against hawc2 results using the dtu 10mw reference wind turbine blade bak et al 2013 the developed simulation tool is applied in a series of load cases to study the characteristics of wind induced dynamic responses of the blade installation system in turbulent winds and extreme operating gust winds 2 aerodynamic modeling in this section the aerodynamic modeling of a single blade is presented based on the cross flow principle before going into details of the aerodynamic model the coordinate systems used in the modeling are clearly defined 2 1 reference frame as shown in fig 3 three coordinate systems were used i e the global coordinate system o x y z body fixed coordinate system for the blade o x y z and local airfoil blade cross section coordinate system o c x c y c z c which are all right handed coordinate systems the origin o of the blade body fixed coordinate is located at the blade center of gravity cog the y axis is in the spanwise direction and x axis is positive towards the trialling edge while z axis follows the right hand rule the instantaneous rotational motions of the blade around x y and z axis are respectively roll ϕ pitch θ and yaw ψ when ϕ θ and ψ are all zero o x y z parallels with the global coordinate o x y z the y c axis of the local airfoil coordinate coincides with the y axis while the x c axis is along the chord line given a vector represented by l g in the global coordinate system its representation in the blade body fixed coordinate system is 1 l b t g b l g furthermore the representation of l b in the local airfoil coordinate system is 2 l c t b c l b where t g b and t b c are the coordinate transformation matrix the t g b is a function of instantaneous blade rotational motion ϕ θ ψ while t b c is a function of structural twist angle of blade local cross sections the transformation matrix from the global coordinate to the local airfoil coordinate t g c is 3 t g c t b c t g b 2 2 cross flow principle in the aerodynamic force calculation the blade is divided into a number of elements for each element the calculation of aerodynamic loads is based on the cross flow principle horner 1965 hoerner and borst 1985 which has been widely used in wind energy industry in the cross flow principle the inflow velocity normal to the cross section is neglected as shown in fig 4 thus the component of relative inflow velocity v a i on y c axis is neglected i e 4 v r e l v a i x c 0 v a i z c t where v a i x c and v a i z c are respectively the projection of v a i on axis x c and y c this principle is applicable for calculation of aerodynamic forces on a wind turbine blade where the local blade element suits a 2d approximation the characteristics of v r e l for an element on a lifted blade are quite different from that on a rotating one for an element a rotating blade the large rotational speed has a significant contribution to v r e l however the v r e l for an element on a lifted blade is mainly from the inflow wind velocity it leads to significant discrepancies in aerodynamic loading on the whole blade the overall difference in aerodynamic load between a lifted blade and a rotating blade is further discussed in section 6 1 2 3 calculation of aerodynamic forces fig 5 shows a flow diagram for calculating the aerodynamic load on a lifted blade the instantaneous displacement and velocity of the blade are respectively x b x t y t z t θ t ψ t t and v b v x t v y t v z t v ϕ t v θ t v ψ t t at each time step the whole blade is divided into a number of elements the total force on the blade is the sum of those on all elements for each element its instantaneous position and velocity in the global coordinate system is calculated 5 x i x b 1 3 t g b t t r i b 6 v i v b 1 3 v b 4 6 t g b t t r i b where x i x i t y i t z i t t and v i v x i t v y i t v z i t t r i b is the position vector of element i in the blade body fixed coordinate based on the global position of the i t h element the wind inflow velocity at this element could be obtained i e v w g i the corresponding relative inflow velocity v a i in the local airfoil coordinate can be derived from 7 v a i t g c i v w g i v i v i g i the v i g is the wake induced velocity it is significant for a rotating blade with large rotational speed however it has marginal influence for blades during installation because the blade motion is very small therefore it is neglected here afterwards the relative velocity v r e l used for further aerodynamic calculation is obtained using v a i based on the cross flow principle which was discussed in detail in section 2 2 then the angle of attack α is determined it is used to calculate the lift coefficient c l and drag coefficient c d based on a 2d look up table the table gives the relationship between c l c d and α based on the calculated c l and c d coefficients for each element the aerodynamic lift drag force are calculated furthermore the aerodynamic forces on the whole blade are obtained as the sum of those on all elements the total aerodynamic forces are given in the global coordinate system at blade cog moreover there is an option to include dynamic stall effect before the table look up the beddoes leishman dynamic stall model is used which is explained in the next section 2 4 beddoes leishman stall model the beddoes leishman dynamic stall model was originally proposed by leishman and beddoes 1989 for helicopter aerodynamics later gupta and leishman 2006 adapted it for application in wind turbine aerodynamics as shown on the right side of fig 5 there are three parts in the beddoes leishman dynamic stall model i e unsteady attached flow unsteady separated flow and dynamic vortex lift in the unsteady attached flow regime the aerodynamic loading consists of a circulatory and an impulsive part the circulatory component is due to the change of angle of attack while the impulsive component is related to the change rate of α and pitch moment furthermore the attached flow results are modified due to flow separation on the low pressure side of the airfoil including leading edge and trailling edge separations the final part of the model is the vortex build up and shedding the vortex lift contribution is empirically modeled as an excess circulation in the vicinity of the airfoil using the difference between the normal force coefficient c n from attached flow and separated flow the total loading on the airfoil is the sum of the aforementioned components 2 5 inflow wind the developed simulation tool can account for steady wind turbulent wind and gust wind the steady wind is constant in time and space the turbulent wind is described by the iec kaimal model iec 2005 for the turbulent wind the three dimensional full field wind file is generated by using the nrel s turbsim program jonkman 2009 the extreme operating gust wind is defined according to iec 6400 1 iec 2005 the effects of wind shear is considered in the inflow wind the wind shear effect is described by the power law wind profile i e 8 v z v z r e f z z r e f α s where v z is the wind speed at height z while v z r e f is the wind speed at reference height z which is normally the hub height in addition α s is the wind shear exponent iec 2009 the wind yaw angle ψ w is defined as the angle between the wind inflow direction and the global x axis in o x y plane it is positive in the anticlockwise direction as shown in fig 6 the wind flows along the positive global x axis when ψ w is zero 3 development of the integrated simulation tool the developed aerodynamic code is coupled with simo marintek 2015a b to formulate the integrated simulation tool simo aero for blade installation simo is widely used in time domain simulations of marine operations in the offshore oil gas and renewable energy industries it could be used to simulate dynamic loads and responses for onshore foundations and offshore jack up crane vessels or floating vessels the coupled simo aero code could account for aerodynamics of the installed blade hydrodynamics of the installation vessel and mechanical couplings between bodies in the multi body system the simo aero code developed in this paper is a fully coupled code as shown in fig 7 the instantaneous blade displacement and velocity in the global coordinate system is calculated by simo at each time step the instantaneous displacement is used to update the transformation matrix from global to local blade element coordinate systems then the blade velocity and wind inflow velocity in the global coordinate system are transferred into the local blade element coordinate system to update the relative velocity seen by the local blade element and the angle of attack the corresponding lift and drag coefficients are determined from a look up table and are used to estimate the lift and drag forces in the local blade element coordinate system these aerodynamic forces are then transferred into the global coordinate system and are sent back to simo to calculate the blade displacement and velocity for the next time step fig 8 shows the modeling of external loads and internal coupling for the blade installation system the system for blade installation usually consists of a crane vessel a hook a yoke and the blade to be installed the hook is connected to the crane via the lift wire four slings spread down from the hook to the yoke which holds the blade the blade and the yoke are modeled as one rigid body denoted by by two horizontal tugger lines run from the yoke to the crane boom in order to control the blade motions in the present paper the coupled simo aero code was applied in case studies with focus on the wind induced responses of the blade a jack up crane vessel which is assumed to be rigid and rigidly fixed to the seabed is used the wave load hydrostatic loads and current loads are all not considered for the jack up crane vessel 3 1 aerodynamic model the aerodynamic model is extensively described in section 2 it is based on the cross flow principle and accounts for the effect of turbulence and dynamic stall however there are still limitations in the aerodynamic model the dynamic inflow effect the wind loads on yoke and influence of yoke geometry on the flow field are assumed to be insignificant and not included for the case study presented later a straight blade is considered besides the blade is assumed to be rigid gaunaa et al 2014 studied the importance of structural flexibility for a wind turbine blade during installation using the dtu 10mw blade it was found that the influence of structural flexibility is negligible as long as the natural frequency of blade rigid body motion is below 2 51 rad s 0 4 hz the results in section 7 1 show that the natural frequency of blade rigid motion is 0 5 rad s which is well below 2 51 rad s thus the blade flexibility has minor effect on the dynamic response of the blade during the installation phase 3 2 mechanical coupling model the bodies involved in the blade installation system are coupled with each other via lift wire slings or tugger lines the coupling forces in the wires are modeled as linear spring forces zero compression 9 t k δ l t 0 where t is the wire tension and δ l is the wire elongation besides k is the axial stiffness of the wire which is given by 10 1 k l e a 1 k 0 where l and a are respectively the length and cross sectional area of the wire e the modulus elasticity of the material of the wire and 1 k 0 the connection flexibility 4 system description since jack up crane vessels are most commonly used for blade installations of offshore wind turbines a jack up crane vessel is used in the following case studies as shown in fig 9 the blade used in this study is the dtu 10mw reference wind turbine blade bak et al 2013 the hub height is 119 m above the mean sea surface the blade is considered to be straight which is 86 37 m long and weighs about 42 tons the blade cog is located 26 2 m from its root the blade is divided into 55 elements during the calculation of aerodynamic loads the corresponding chord length twist angle thickness and airfoil coefficients at each blade element are interpolated based on those described by bak et al 2013 a yoke weighting 47 tons is placed around the blade cog to hold the blade two horizontal tugger lines are deployed from the yoke to the crane structure both tugger lines are 3 m long and have an arm length of 10 m as shown in fig 9 table 1 is a summary of the system properties the detailed wire properties in the system are presented in table 2 the crane wire is a typical metal wire rope with diameter of 60 mm lankhorst ropes 2013 the flexibility of the lift wire is due to the deformation of the crane boom and wires from crane tip to crane winch the slings have a diameter of 30 mm while the diameter of the tugger lines is 5 mm in addition material damping in wire is included in the model which is about 1 of the wire stiffness according to the simo theory manual marintek 2015a 4 1 eigenvalue analysis eigenvalue analysis is conducted to evaluate the eigen periods of rigid body motions of the hook blade and yoke in the numerical model the blade and yoke are modeled as one body which is denoted by by the eigen periods and modes are obtained by solving eq 11 11 ω 2 m a k x 0 where m a and k are the mass added mass and restoring matrix of the by and hook since they are in air the added mass matrix a is zero in addition the restoring matrix k mainly comes from the gravity of involved bodies lift wire slings and tugger lines as shown in table 3 the by and hook coupled motions have 9 eigen modes the dominated motion s of each eigen mode is emphasized in bold the 1 s t mode has the largest eigen period 13 63s corresponding to the system pendulum motion in the blade local y b z b plane shown in fig 9 the 2 n d is dominated by the yaw motion of the by the 3 r d mode is a combination of transnational motions in the horizontal plane and rotational motion in the vertical plane the eigen periods of these two modes are much shorter due to the influence of the tugger lines the last 6 modes have short natural periods which are below 3s the first mode is the most important for the dynamics of the system as demonstrated by the spectral analysis of blade motion in section 7 1 5 load cases and environmental conditions a series of load cases are defined for code verification and time domain simulations as given in tables 4 and 5 it should be noted that these load cases are not from design codes but are only chosen for the numerical study in this paper however the largest turbulence intensity 15 72 in the load cases is chosen according to the design class c in iec 6400 1 iec 2005 load case lc1 is the steady wind case which is used to verify the aerodynamic code in load case lc2 turbulent wind is applied it is used to demonstrate the necessity of using an advanced aerodynamic model and how much inaccuracy a simplified aerodynamic model might cause as discussed in section 6 the simplification made means that blade velocity is neglected in the calculation of aerodynamic loads load case lc3 is a turbulent wind case with varying turbulence intensity t i lc3 is designed to study the characteristics of the blade installation system under turbulent wind condition including global motion of the blade aerodynamic loads acting on the blade and tension in crane wire and tugger lines turbulent wind is also used in load cases lc4 and lc5 while their initial blade pitch angles θ b are different from lc3 the θ b represents the initial orientation of blade relative to the horizontal plane lc4 and lc5 are used for comparison against lc3 to analyze the influence of blade pitch angle on two vital parameters during installation system i e the blade root motion and loads in tugger lines in load case lc6 the turbulence intensity t i is constant while the wind inflow angle ψ w varies from 0 to 75 the corresponding results show the influence of ψ w on the extreme responses in load case lc1 only one run with duration of 100s is conducted since the blade is fixed and the wind is steady however 50 runs are executed for each simulation with duration of 600s in the turbulent wind load cases lc2 lc6 the reason for using 10min as the simulation time is that the duration of mating the blade onto hub usually takes approximately 10min fifty runs are to ensure the robustness of the obtained statistics moreover 500s is used before the turbulent wind starts in each simulation to remove the transient effect due to simulation start up extreme operating gust wind eog represents rapid change in wind speed it is applied to study the dynamic responses of the blade installation system under sudden transient change of inflow wind speed table 5 lists the eog load cases load cases lc7 and lc8 have the same gust wind while their blade pitch angles θ b are different the purpose is to study the dynamic response of the blade installation system under extreme operating gust wind and the influence of θ b on the dynamic responses the wind speed of an eog is given as 12 v z t v z 0 37 v g u s t s i n 3 π t t g 1 c o s 2 π t t g for 0 t g v z otherwise where t g is the duration of wind gust i e 10 5 s iec 2005 besides v g u s t is the gust velocity at the hub height which is determined by the hub height wind speed etc in addition v z is the wind speed at height z which is determined by the wind shear effect and wind speed at hub height 6 verification of the coupled simulation tool verification of the coupled simulation tool is carried out module by module simo has been widely validated and used in the offshore oil gas and renewable energy industries therefore only verification of the aero code is carried out code to code comparison against hawc2 is conducted using the dtu 10mw reference wind turbine blade under load case lc1 fig 10 show the comparison of lift and drag force it is shown that the results from the developed code are in good accordance with the hawc2 results however it should be noted that this code to code comparison only verifies the aerodynamic code but does not validate the model against experimental data since they are very difficult to obtain fig 10 reveals the influence of blade pitch angle θ b 0 θ b 90 and wind yaw angle ψ w 120 ο ψ w 120 ο on the blade aerodynamic loads with the increase of θ b the aerodynamic lift force f z firstly experiences an increasing trend before θ b reaches 45 and then starts to decrease until θ b 90 however the aerodynamic drag force f x experiences a consistent increase until θ 90 at the mean time both f z and f x scale with the cosine function of ψ w the peak value of f x at ψ w 0 is over 30 k n which is 50 larger than the peak of f z at the same yaw angle the roll moment m x shown in fig 11 a shares the same trend with f z because it is the integration of lift force along the blade with an arm around the blade cog similar to f d the yaw moment m z increases until θ b reaches 90 6 1 comparison of aerodynamic force distribution on a lifted blade and a rotating blade the distribution of aerodynamic forces on a lifted blade is quite different from a rotating one fig 12 compares the lift and drag force distribution on a blade during rotation and lifted condition in lc1 the blade has zero initial pitch angle in both conditions besides the rotating blade has a rotational speed of 8 029 rpm as shown in fig 12 both lift and drag forces for the rotating blade experience an increasing trend towards the tip the aerodynamic center of the rotating blade stays close to the blade tip it indicates that the rotational speed plays an important role in the aerodynamic force distribution of a rotating blade for the lifted blade the main contribution of the aerodynamic loads comes from the middle and root part of the blade thus the aerodynamic center of a lifted blade is located close to the blade root compared to the inflow wind velocity the velocity of a lifted blade is insignificant fig 13 shows the aerodynamic distribution on a lifted blade with variation of blade pitch angle in lc1 the pink dense line fig 13 represents the blade cog while the dotted lines stands for the aerodynamic center at different θ b as shown in fig 13 a the aerodynamic center of lift force for θ b 0 is 20 m from the blade root then it moves to around 40 m from root at θ b 45 afterwards it moves back towards the blade root as θ b increases when the blade pitch angle is 90 the aerodynamic center of lift force is the same with zero pitch angle on the contrary the aerodynamic center of drag force consistently moves towards blade tip as θ b increases 6 2 influence of blade velocity on the system response in the current method for calculation of aerodynamic loads the velocity v i at blade elements due to blade motion i e v m g is taken into consideration as shown in eq 7 since the blade velocity is small compared with wind inflow velocity there might be thoughts to neglect the blade velocity bv in the aerodynamic load calculation in this section the influence of blade velocity in the aerodynamic load calculation is discussed approach with bv considering v i in the calculation of aerodynamic loads the relative inflow velocity in the local airfoil coordinate system is 13 v a i t g c i v w g i v i approach without bv neglecting v i in the calculation of aerodynamic loads the relative inflow velocity in the local airfoil coordinate system is 14 v a i t g c i v i in addition it should be noted that the instantaneous position of the blade is used in the coordinate transformation matrix t g c i in both approaches load case lc2 is used in the comparison of these two approaches the blade roll motion and aerodynamic roll moment on the blade are taken as examples in the comparison figs 14 and 15 respectively compare the time series and spectra of the blade roll motion and aerodynamic roll moment on the blade calculated based on approach with bv with consider blade velocity in the calculation of aerodynamic load and without bv without consider blade velocity in the calculation of aerodynamic load in lc2 with blade initial pitch angle θ b 0 as shown in fig 14 a and b neglecting the blade velocity during the calculation of aerodynamic loads leads to a marginal decrease of the amplitude of aerodynamic roll moment m x at ω 0 46 r a d s which is the resonant frequency of roll motion as a consequence neglecting the blade velocity leads to significant discrepancies in the blade motion as shown in fig 15 a and b similar trends are seen in the comparison of these two approaches in lc2 with blade initial pitch angle θ b 45 as shown in figs 16 and 17 however neglecting the blade velocity during the calculation of aerodynamic loads at θ b 45 leads to a much smaller difference in blade roll motion because the total aerodynamic roll moment on the blade at θ b 45 is less sensitive to the variation of angles of attack at all blade elements induced by neglecting the blade velocity than at θ b 0 even though the blade velocity has marginal impact on the amplitude of aerodynamic loads it is essential to include it in the aerodynamic load calculations since it plays an important role in terms of aerodynamic damping the blade motion is highly dominated by pendulum motion for which the damping is small thus the aerodynamic damping due to blade motion is crucial for the dynamic response of the blade when it is neglected the blade motion will be significantly overestimated 6 3 influence of tugger line arrangement on blade dynamic motion as mentioned in section 4 a representative value of the tugger line arm length 10 m relative to the blade cog was used which is also shown in fig 18 a to investigate the impact of tugger line arrangement on the dynamic characteristics of blade motion a shorter tugger line arm length i e 5 m was applied as illustrated in fig 18 b for comparison the results are shown in fig 19 as shown in fig 19 a and b the dynamic responses of blade sway and roll with tugger line arm length of 10 m are slightly smaller than that for the 5 m case however significant reduction of blade yaw motion is seen in fig 19 c by increase of the tugger line arm length from 5 m to 10 m that is because the tugger line arm length of 10 m increases the resonant frequency of blade yaw motion to a high level where resonant response is greatly reduced 7 results and discussions the developed coupled simulation tool simo aero is applied to study the wind induced dynamic response of the system prior to the mating process the characteristics of stochastic dynamic response of the blade installation system is analyzed the study is further extended by analyzing the extreme responses of the system under turbulent wind and extreme operating gust wind conditions 7 1 stochastic dynamic responses of the blade installation system in turbulent wind the global responses of the blade installation system in load case lc2 are studied in this section in load case lc3 the wind yaw angle ψ w and blade initial pitch angle θ b are both zero while the turbulence intensity t i of the inflow wind varies from 1 to 15 72 table 6 shows the mean values of the global responses such as blade motions aerodynamic loads on the blade and tensions in crane wire and tugger lines the non zero mean values of roll and yaw are respectively resulted from the aerodynamic roll and yaw moment the roll motion leads to difference of tension in tugger lines which causes the non zero blade sway motion the standard deviations stds of blade surge heave and pitch are not presented since they are almost zero the stds of blade sway roll and yaw with variation of wind turbulence intensity t i are shown in fig 20 a the blade roll motion is much larger than its yaw as mentioned in section 4 the tugger lines are deployed in the horizontal plane which control the blade yaw motion however constraints in the vertical plane are much weaker leading to significant blade roll motion moreover the stds of blade sway roll and yaw scale linearly with t i besides the std variation of aerodynamic loads and tensions in crane wire and tugger lines which are respectively shown in fig 20 b 20 d experience a similar linear trend over t i the linear scale relationship between system response and wind turbulence intensity can be expressed as 15 σ s w a y σ r o l l σ y a w σ f x 0 σ f z σ m x 0 σ m z σ f c w σ f t u g 1 σ f t u g 2 t i a where a is a matrix of the scale parameters which are determined by the inflow wind characteristics and properties of the blade such as mean wind speed density of air aerodynamic and structural properties of the blade etc this indicates that the stds of blade motions aerodynamic loads and wire tensions are proportional to the wind turbulent intensity it agrees with and further extends one of the conclusions in ref gaunaa et al 2014 the agreed conclusion is that the aerodynamic loading on a lifted blade is proportional to t i in lc2 a is found to be 16 a 0 0026 0 0071 0 0008 0 0365 0 0 1029 1 1376 0 0 6176 0 1018 0 0842 0 0980 furthermore spectral analysis for blade motions is conducted particularly for sway roll and yaw motions as shown in fig 21 all of the three spectra have a peak around ω 0 46 r a d s the corresponding peak period is approximately 13 63 s which is the natural period of the 1 s t mode of the system rigid body motion shown in table 3 it indicates that the pendulum motion dominates the system responses besides the yaw spectrum has other two small peaks between ω 1 5 r a d s and ω 2 0 r a d s which are respectively the eigen periods of the 7th and 8th modes shown in table 3 moreover the spectrum peaks also increase with increasing turbulence intensity which indicates that the blade motion is larger at higher turbulent intensity 7 2 stochastic motion response at blade root in turbulent wind the blade root displacement relative to the hub position can be expressed as 17 δ x δ y δ z t x x 0 y y 0 z z 0 t where x 0 y 0 and z 0 are the position of hub center fig 22 shows an example of the time series of blade root displacements and velocities it is shown that the surge motion at blade root is the smallest while the heave motion is the largest the horizontal tugger lines provide significant restoring in surge however the restoring in sway and heave relies on the slings and crane wires which are quite limited moreover the spectral analysis for motions at blade root is conducted as shown in fig 23 the heave spectrum at blade root shown in fig 23 c has the largest values which is due to the significant blade roll motion the surge spectrum at blade root in fig 23 a has a similar trend with the blade yaw spectrum in fig 21 c this indicates that the surge motion at blade root is mainly resulted from the blade yaw motion the amplitude in sway spectrum at blade root in fig 23 b is very close to the amplitude of blade sway spectrum in fig 21 a it indicates that the blade rotational motions have marginal contribution to the sway motion at blade root compared with blade sway 7 3 extreme response in turbulent wind in this section the extreme values of critical parameters in the lifting system during the blade mating process are studied for the mating process of the blade onto hub the blade root motion in the x z plane is very critical if the blade root motion in x z plane is too large the blade cannot be mated onto the hub in this study the blade root motion in the x z plane is denoted as r r o o t 18 r r o o t δ x 2 δ z 2 the sway motion at blade root is also important because it might lead to destructive collisions the sway motion at blade root is expressed as 19 y r o o t δ y besides the sway velocity at blade root is denoted as v y r o o t the tension in crane wire is not considered as a critical parameter since it has small variation from its mean value the extreme tension in tugger lines f t u g is considered to be critical as it adds extra force and moment to the crane boom 7 3 1 extreme value estimation the extreme values in this study are calculated based on the mean up crossing rate method naess and moan 2012 in this method it is assumed that the high threshold up crossings are statistically independent thus a poisson probability distribution can be applied for the extreme values let m t m a x y t 0 t t denotes the extreme value for a random process y t over the duration of t if the process is stationary the corresponding probability of exceedance for extreme values is given by 20 p m t y 1 e x p v y t where v y is the mean up crossing rate the sample estimated mean value of v y can be calculated from simulated time series 21 v ˆ y 1 k t j 1 k n j y t where n j y t represents the number of up crossings at level y of the j t h time history during 0 t besides k is the number of time series with enough number of time series a good approximation of 95 confidence interval ci can be obtained i e 22 c i y v ˆ y 1 96 s ˆ y k eq 21 22 are the basics for the empirical estimation of the mean upcrossing rate from direct numerical simulations i e monte carlo simulation however direct numerical simulations are very time consuming especially for low probability levels chai et al 2015 to be more time efficient an extrapolation technique is applied naess and gaidai 2008 the 10 min extreme values are studied with 3 3 probability of exceedence which corresponds to occur once within 300min according to dnv rp h103 standard det norske veritas 2011 the corresponding mean upcrossing rate is 5 593 10 5 fifty time series are used for the extreme value estimation of each sub case fig 24 a and b present two examples of the fitting and extrapolation 7 3 2 effects of turbulence intensity the influence of wind turbulence intensity t i on the system extreme responses is studied in this section load cases lc3 lc4 and lc5 are used the turbulence intensity t i varies within each load case while the blade initial pitch angle θ b increases from 0 in lc3 to 45 in lc5 fig 25 shows the results specifically fig 25 a shows the extremes of r r o o t fig 25 b and c present respectively the extreme sway displacement y r o o t and velocity v y r o o t at blade root fig 25 d shows the extreme tension in tugger lines f t u g similar to the standard deviations of the system response in section 7 1 the system extreme responses also increase linearly with increasing t i at the same time the extreme responses experience a non linear increasing trend with the increase of θ b the extreme responses at θ b 0 is small a dramatic increase occurs when θ b increases to 30 in lc4 the extreme responses at θ b 45 in lc5 reach their respective peak values the variation trend over θ b is similar to that of the aerodynamic forces and moments shown in figs 10 and 11 take the extreme values of r r o o t as an example the extreme value of r r o o t at t i 15 72 is over three times larger than the corresponding extreme at t i 5 besides the extreme value of r r o o t also varies a lot with increasing blade pitch angle at t i 15 72 the extreme value of r r o o t increases over two times when θ b increases from 0 to 45 compared with r r o o t the extreme value of y r o o t is slightly smaller at large pitch angle the extreme value of v y r o o t is significant this indicates that large blade pitch angle makes it more difficult to mate the blade onto hub and increases the chance of blade root collision with hub 7 3 3 effects of wind direction fig 26 a shows the influence of wind yaw angle ψ b on the extreme responses of the system using load case lc6 six yaw angles are simulated varying between 0 and 75 it is shown that all the extreme responses are linear functions of the cosine functions of ψ b the fitted line is presented as the blue curve in fig 26 a it is shown that the system extreme responses decrease with increasing wind yaw angle this indicates that larger wind yaw angle makes the mating operation of a blade onto hub easier 7 4 stochastic dynamic response of the system in extreme operating gust wind the influence of extreme operating wind gust on the dynamic response of the system is studied in this section as shown in fig 27 different blade initial pitch angles θ b are applied i e 0 in lc7 and 45 in lc8 the same gust wind is used for both cases the gust wind inflow angle ψ b is zero and the mean wind speed is 10 m s fig 27 b shows the time series of the gust wind speed the wind gust starts at 300s and ends at 310 5s the other graphs in fig 27 show the blade root motion and aerodynamic loading on the blade to have a better illustration of the response time series between 290s and 350 is presented as shown in fig 27 b and c the aerodynamic loads on the blade follow the gust wind simultaneously compared with lc7 the aerodynamic loads in lc8 have a much larger peak nevertheless the aerodynamic loads in both cases become stable after the gust wind ends which indicates that the aerodynamic loads on a lifted blade are mainly dominated by inflow wind velocity however compared with the blade aerodynamic loads the motion responses at blade root experience a different trend as shown in fig 27 d 27 f the blade root motions fluctuate a lot moreover much larger fluctuations are seen by blade root motion in lc8 the fluctuation of blade root surge motion δ x is dominated by two cycles which agrees with the spectrum of blade root surge motion in fig 23 a apparently the sway δ y and heave δ z motions at blade root fluctuate with the natural frequency of the 1 s t eigen mode shown in fig 23 b and c the maximum responses of blade root motions are listed in table 7 in load case lc7 the maximum values of r r o o t y r o o t and v y r o o t are all very small nevertheless in lc8 the maximum values of r r o o t and y r o o t are respectively 0 43 m and 0 33 m compared with results in fig 25 the maximum responses in the extreme operating gust wind are equivalent to the extreme responses under turbulent wind with turbulence intensity of 7 8 conclusions this paper deals with the development verification and application of an integrated simulation tool for modeling and dynamic analysis of single blade installation for wind turbines on the basis of cross flow principle an aerodynamic code denoted as aero code is developed considering the effect of wind turbulence extreme operating gusts and dynamic stall the developed aero code is then coupled with simo to formulate the integrated simulation tool i e simo aero code the coupled simo aero code could be used to evaluate the system performance during single blade installation for offshore as well as onshore wind turbines accounting for aerodynamics hydrodynamics and wire coupling mechanics verification of the simulation tool is conducted module by module simo has been widely verified and used the aero code is verified by code to code comparisons against hawc2 results it is shown that the aero code gives accurate estimation of the aerodynamic loads the characteristics of aerodynamic loads on a lifted blade are quite different from a rotating one for a lifted blade the main contributions of aerodynamic loads come from the middle and root part of the blade furthermore the aerodynamic damping is of great importance in the dynamic response of blade during installation the developed integrated simulation tool is then applied to simulate the wind induced dynamic responses of a dtu 10mw reference wind turbine blade prior to mating using a jack up crane vessel stochastic dynamic analysis reveals the characteristics of the blade installation system the blade motions are dominated by pendulum motions sway and roll motion of the blade are significant leading to large sway and heave motion at the blade root furthermore the system critical responses are identified which are respectively blade root surge and heave motion displacement and velocity of root sway and tension in tugger lines moreover the critical responses are further studied in turbulent wind and gust wind the results indicate that a larger wind yaw angle and a smaller blade pitch angle ease the difficulty of mating the blade onto the hub besides installing a blade under extreme operating gust wind is less difficult than in strong turbulent wind the horizontally deployed tugger lines are commonly used in offshore blade installation however they do not provide enough constraints in the lateral and vertical directions leading to significant blade root motions in sway and heave to reduce motions at blade root increasing damping in the tugger lines or adjusting tugger line configurations might help besides a yoke with automatic motion compensation is expected to have a better control of motions at the blade root moreover the blade root motion is highly sensitive to the initial pitch angle of the blade wind turbulence intensity and wind direction during the planning and operational phases of offshore wind turbine blade installation these factors are recommended to be considered together with the mean wind speed in this way the offshore blade installation could be conducted safely economically and more efficiently 9 future work in this study the jack up crane vessel including the crane were assumed to be rigid and rigidly fixed to the seabed in reality the crane tip of the jack up crane vessel moves due to the motion of the jack up vessel under wave loads and the deformation of the crane at large lifting height this movement has some impacts on the dynamic response of the blade during installation a future study will be conducted to evaluate the influence of wave induced loads on the jack up crane vessel and deformation of the jack up crane vessel and the crane on the dynamic behavior of the blade during installation study on blade installation by a floating crane vessel is also to be conducted by using the developed simulation tool in the future it is expected to be favored by the offshore wind industry due to the rapid development of offshore wind energy acknowledgment the authors appreciate the support from the department of marine technology

23572,the hydraulic performance of onshore barriers in response to tsunami and a tsunami driven shipping container was examined experimentally for the barriers subjected to tsunami up to twice their designed height experiments with various barrier permeability were conducted to assess the mitigation effect and the concurrent forces on the barrier the perforated barrier with 30 porosity reduced the momentum flux of the inundation flow behind the barrier by 40 60 even when the water overflowed the barrier below the overflow limit the barrier reduced the fluid force acting on it by 40 of the corresponding force on the impermeable barrier the force on the perforated barrier was close to half the momentum flux of the incoming inundation the low permeability barrier buffered the impact of the drifting shipping container and reduced the impact force on the barrier the total force induced by the inundation flow associated with the driftage was reduced with decreasing permeability of the barrier the inverse relation between the impact forces acting on the high and low porosity barriers was in contrast to that of the fluid forces the permeability of wall type structures has an important influence on inundation mitigation and reduction of the fluid force and the impact force keywords coastal defense tsunami mitigation wall type structure wave force tsunami driftage impact force 1 introduction in tsunami prone areas it is important to consider the complexity and resilience of the coastal defense structures as well as effective plans for evacuation and land use based on the magnitude of the tsunami and the land use status and trends an extremely large tsunami will cause serious damage to coastal areas not only from the tsunami wave over the land but also from tsunami driven objects e g takahashi et al 2011 suppasri et al 2012 naito et al 2014 boats shipping containers cars timber and the like can drift into ports and coastal areas and cause damage to the surrounding areas in addition to that inflicted by the tsunami wave and obstruct the recovery effort thus measures to prevent damage from tsunami driven objects must be implemented along with prevention and mitigation of tsunami overland flow to ensure minimum safety standards in tsunami prone areas comprehensive multiple defenses against tsunamis and development of tough and resilient coastal defense structures are required this study focuses on the hydraulic performance of onshore perforated wave barriers which captured boats shipping containers and timber that drifted into a number of japanese ports and harbors after the huge tsunami caused by the 2011 great east japan earthquake fig 1 the perforated barriers were installed along the coast and outside ports where roads railways and buildings are located very close to the shore this type of barrier is used to reduce wave splash and spray over the top of seawalls and as a shield against wind and dust the structure consists of a wall of perforated sheet metal with holes a few cm in diameter creating a porosity of 30 40 supported by columns the tsunami height dataset of the 2011 tohoku earthquake tsunami joint survey group mori and takahashi 2012 shows that the perforated barriers were subjected to extremely high tsunami waves see fig 1 however while the perforated barriers captured tsunami driven objects they did not suffer any structural damage thus the permeability of the perforated barriers may act to lessen the force of the tsunami wave and reduce the damage caused by the wave and the tsunami driven objects while perforated barriers can protect against waves and tsunamis they are also compact and do not block the view of the ocean which is important for evacuation management unlike high solid walls perforated barriers have the advantage of retaining an open space feeling therefore perforated barriers can be part of a multi system protection scheme which uses existing coastal facilities and different methods of coastal disaster prevention some field observations e g kamikubo et al 2009 hirano et al 2013 fig 1 suggest that perforated wave barriers can be used as an effective measure to prevent and mitigate coastal flooding disasters however there have been no reports of a quantitative assessment of the mitigation effects of onshore perforated barriers on tsunami inundation and on the forces generated by tsunamis and tsunami driftage the effect of the impact forces of water driven objects on slender structures such as columns has been studied through experimental and theoretical research matsutomi 1993 1999 2009 investigated the collision behavior and impact forces of tsunami driven wood logs and proposed a practical evaluation formula for the impact force on a column haehnel and daly 2002 2004 performed steady flow experiments and showed that the maximum impact force of woody debris was a function of the impact velocity debris mass and the effective stiffness of the collision laboratory experiments of a shipping container exposed to tsunami flow over land were conducted by mizutani et al 2005 who investigated the fluid force on a shipping container on a wharf the drift velocity and the impact force on a slender column considering that the impact force is influenced by the material property and structural rigidity of the impacting and impacted objects arikawa et al 2007 measured the impact force between a large scale model of a concrete wall and a steel shipping container and found that the empirical formula based on the hertzian method was useful to evaluate the impact force recently ko et al 2015 conducted large scale experiments on the impact forces caused by in air and in water collisions between a column and a 1 5 scale shipping container they compared the results from the in air and in water tests to quantify the hydraulic effects on the debris impact force and duration a numerical investigation on the response of reinforced concrete columns to the impact of shipping containers was carried out by madurapperuma and wijeyewickrema 2013 however estimating the impact force of tsunami driven objects on a structure is complex because it is influenced by the various properties of the driftage and the structure haehnel and daly 2004 insufficient knowledge exists on the impact force of tsunami waves and driftage on permeable wall type structures and the hydraulic performance of the structures in response to these forces the forces acting on impermeable walls and columns as a result of simple tsunami overland flow with no driftage have been studied since the 1960s e g fukui et al 1963 cross 1967 ramsden 1996 fujima et al 2009 nouri et al 2010 recently several studies were conducted on the mitigation effects of various types of coastal defense structures oshnack et al 2009 and thomas and cox 2012 investigated low lying seawalls that helped reduce building damage in the 2004 indian ocean tsunami they conducted systematic experiments to quantify the reduction of the tsunami run up and force on a building behind a low lying seawall linton et al 2013 investigated the interaction between a solitary tidal bore and a wood frame wall at full scale using a large wave flume to understand how a flexible structure performs when subjected to tsunami overland flow and to evaluate the fluid force acting on the wall however inadequate investigations examined the interaction between tsunamis and perforated onshore structures though many studies were conducted on the interaction between storm waves and perforated coastal structures e g li et al 2006 huang et al 2011 elbisy 2015 many aspects regarding the interaction between tsunami overland flow tsunami driven objects and permeable structures such as perforated barriers are still unknown for effective mitigation of tsunami disasters in coastal areas a good understanding of the changes in the characteristics of the fluid forces and impact forces acting on permeable structures installed on land is needed the permeability of perforated barriers will change the characteristics of tsunami propagation including the reflection transmission and attenuation of the wave which affects the dynamic response and impact force of the tsunami driftage as it collides with the barriers in general high permeability decreases reflection and attenuation of wave and increase transmission the relations between wave propagation and force on barriers are not fully understood understanding of characteristics of inundation and impact is particularly important for design of barriers and development of effective defense from tsunami driven objects it is therefore necessary to understand the fundamental characteristics of the interactions between various structures and tsunami driven objects however almost no quantitative evaluations have been conducted on mitigating inundation and capturing tsunami driftage by onshore perforated barriers furthermore better knowledge of the hydraulic performance and responses of coastal structures subjected to tsunamis exceeding their designed load is important for developing safety measures against extremely large tsunamis the purpose of this study is to determine how onshore perforated barriers mitigate the tsunami inundation fluid forces and impact forces that act on them focusing on effects of variation in permeability of barriers and overflow at barriers this study complements the previous work of umeda et al 2014a 2014b experiments were conducted on five types of barriers installed on land behind a vertical seawall in a wide range of tsunami inundation where the inundation depth in front of the barriers varied from half to twice of the barrier height the results of the tests using impermeable and permeable barriers were compared to quantify the influence of the permeability of the barriers on the tsunami inundation fluid force and impact force in this paper we first examine the variation in the inundation levels offshore and onshore of the barriers and the fluid force acting on the barriers under various hydraulic and structural conditions and then discuss the relationship between the inundation reduction and fluid force changes second we examine the variation of the impact force due to a shipping container driven by tsunami overland flow and the total force due to the flow and the shipping container and discuss the characteristics of the impact force and the total force on various types of onshore barriers this paper provides a characterization of the fundamental physical process of the interaction between tsunami overland flow tsunami driftage and a coastal barrier as well as a careful assessment of the effects of various perforated barriers on tsunami mitigation and on the relevant forces 2 experimental setup procedures and conditions two series of laboratory experiments were carried out one replicated the interaction between tsunami overland flow and various types of barriers tb and the other modelled the interaction among tsunami overland flow a barrier and a tsunami driven shipping container tcb the tb test was conducted to estimate the fundamental hydraulic performance of various barriers exposed to tsunami inundation and the characteristics of the force of the fluid acting on each barrier the tcb test was conducted to investigate the behavior of a tsunami driven shipping container and the difference between the container impact force and the fluid force hereafter impact force means the force due to collision between a tsunami driven shipping container and a barrier and fluid force means the force due to tsunami alone consequently the forces measured in the tcb test consist of impact force and fluid force both tests were conducted under the same conditions of bathymetry structures and incident tsunami the experimental setup modelled a tsunami prone port and coastal areas on a scale of 1 50 2 1 open channel flume all the experiments were conducted using an open channel flume equipped with a slide gate as shown in fig 2 the channel was 12 m long and both the width and depth were 0 4 m the floor was horizontally fixed the gate was lifted in a single motion to instantly let in a large amount of water stored on the other side of the gate to generate a hydraulic bore the gate was located about 3 m offshore from the vertical seawall the land side of the vertical seawall was a dry horizontal floor the height of the floor surface was 0 105 m the uniform depth of the water at the seawall was 0 05 m the floors of the channel and the land were made of smooth painted metal both sides of the open channel flume were made of glass walls the downstream end of the flume was a free outlet 2 2

the top of the lower half of the wall b2 3 a half perforated half solid wall similar to b2 but without the parapet attachment b3 4 a wall of uniformly perforated steel sheet with a porosity of 30 b4 and 5 four thin horizontal steel rods lined up vertically b5 the model parameters of the barriers are summarized in table 1 in this study the porosity ε of each barrier was defined as the proportion of the area in the metal sheet taken up by holes the barriers were made of steel and the height h b and width b b were normalized to 0 06 m and 0 398 cm respectively in the tbc test a shipping container was placed between the leading edge of the seawall and the barrier fig 2 the shipping container was modelled as an international standard fully loaded 20 ft container the dimensions of the scaled model of the shipping container were length l c 12 cm height h c 5 2 cm and width b c 5 0 cm the mass of the container was 170 g the shipping container floating at rest had a draft of about 0 6 times its height the coefficient of static friction of the shipping container placed on the floor was adjusted to be about 0 5 the modelled shipping container was placed parallel lengthwise to the wave crest line and the normal line of the barrier the shipping container and vertical barriers were modelled on a 1 50 scale 2 3 instrumentation and data acquisition the time series of the water surface elevations were measured with capacity type wave gauges ch 604 cht6 40 kenek japan at the seven locations wg1 wg7 along the open channel flume fig 2 three propeller type current meters vo 301a vot2 100 05n kenek japan were used to measure the flow velocities at vm1 vm2 and vm3 the velocity at the leading edge of the tsunami front c nb i e the phase velocity or wave celerity was calculated from the time difference between the peaks of the water surface elevation measured at the different locations two stiff flat springs were installed at the foot of the two strong columns supporting the metal sheets of the barrier to measure the forces acting on the barriers the force was determined from the output of eight strain gauges attached on the front and reverse sides at the upper and lower sections of each spring the water depth flow velocity and force were measured simultaneously at a sampling frequency of 500 hz in the tb tests the measurement for each setting was repeated three times to ensure the reliability of the results the measured data was then averaged to consolidate the results in the tcb tests the drift velocity of the shipping container and the force acting on the barrier exposed to the tsunami overland flow and tsunami driven shipping container were measured simultaneously the drift velocity was derived from image analysis markers were attached to the shipping container model which was recorded from above by a digital high speed video camera has l1 ditect japan at 200 fps the particle tracking velocimetry ptv method was used to estimate the drift velocity the force acting on the barrier was measured using the same method described above to measure the fluid force the measurement for each setting in the tcb test was repeated ten times to calculate variation in the impact between the barrier and the container for barriers b1 and b4 the response of the shipping container to the tsunami overland flow was observed to find the condition that triggered the initial movement of the container and record the collision forces between the container and the barriers the forces and velocities of the drifting container and the inundation depth were measured when the container was stopped by the barriers these observations were also repeated ten times for reliability 2 4 test conditions the water depth in front of the seawall was fixed at 0 05 m and the test was run for four different levels of reservoir water depth h 1 that generated four different heights of hydraulic bore the test conditions are summarized in table 2 the normalized inundation water depth η nb h b and wave celerity c nb 2 2gh b on land at various locations along the channel flume with no barrier and no driven object case nb in the tb test for the four h 1 values are shown in fig 4 the inundation depth of the bore after running up the vertical seawall gradually decreased as the bore progressed further inland the inundation depth at the planned location of the shipping container x l 0 55 was about 30 120 of the height of the shipping container h c while the inundation depth at the planned location of the barrier x l 1 0 was about 25 110 of the height of the barrier h b the head of water as defined by the wave celerity was about twice the inundation depth around the planned locations of the container and barrier the froude number as defined by the flow velocity and inundation depth measured in the vicinity of x l 0 57 at wg3 and vm1 varied between 1 2 and 1 9 the model barrier was installed where the variations in the inundation depth and wave celerity were relatively small 3 hydraulic performance of the onshore barriers 3 1 bore propagation and time series data the propagation of the hydraulic bore generated by opening the reservoir gate was similar for each group of three tests repeated under the same conditions fig 5 shows an example of the time series of the inundation depths around the perforated barrier b4 exposed to tsunami overland flow caused by a bore generated with a reservoir water depth h 1 21 cm the right panels of fig 5 show a sequence of images showing impact of the bore on the barrier the inundation depths were measured three times under the same conditions each set of three repeated measurements exhibited good reproducibility and acceptable stability at all the measurement sites wg3 wg7 when the bore collided with and flowed over the seawall the water surface suddenly rose near the seawall and the bore front continued to travel over the land with the leading portion of the waves breaking umeda et al 2013 the inundation depth at site wg3 initially rose rapidly but then stabilized approaching a constant depth the maximum inundation depth of the incident bore before reflection wave from the barrier reached site wg3 corresponded to the maximum inundation depth of the same site when no wave barrier was installed η nb at wg3 in fig 5 the inundation depth at site wg4 increased to about double the maximum inundation depth η nb of the incident bore at about 1 5 s this was because the water level rose relatively quickly due to the reflected waves that formed when the bore impacted the barrier the water of the incoming bore was blocked at the barrier leading to a rise in the inundation depth at the offshore side of the barrier the water level rise at the barrier is referred to as damming effect of barrier due to the damming effect the inundation depths measured at sites wg5 wg7 in the onshore side of b4 was only about one third of the amplified inundation depth at the offshore side of the barrier both a rise and a drop of the inundation depth occurred at the barrier this behavior was stable throughout this series of experiments 3 2 amplification of tsunami inundation in front of barrier the increase in inundation depth caused by the damming effect of the barrier depends mainly on the permeability of the barrier and the strength of the tsunami overland flow the variation in the amplification factor of the inundation depth with respect to the relative inundation depth η nb h b and the type of barrier is shown in fig 6 the amplification factor is defined as the ratio of the maximum inundation depth of the water piled up against the offshore side of a barrier η bi i 1 5 barrier types to the maximum inundation depth of the incident bore η nb the lower porosity barriers produced a larger amplification factor of the inundation depth the inundation depth of the incident bore was amplified 2 2 5 times when the water reached barriers b1 b4 whereas it increased only slightly when reaching the horizontal rod barrier b5 comparison of the amplification factors of barriers b2 and b3 indicates that the seaward overhang parapet placed on b2 had no influence on the amplification of the inundation depth in front of the barrier η bi η nb varied with the porosity of the barrier and the inundation depth of the incident bore relative to the barrier height the overflow limit η bi h b is represented by the dashed line in fig 6 the limit line corresponds to the condition that the product of two variables in the vertical and horizontal axes of fig 6 is equal to one towards the upper right away from the line η bi h b the overflow becomes significant fig 6 shows that η bi η nb for b1 and b4 peaked on the line of overflow limit the amplification factor reach a maximum when the inundation depth after collision with the barrier was the same height as the barrier the maximum value of η bi η nb was 2 6 at the impermeable barrier b1 for b1 b4 barrier overflow occurred when η nb exceeded 0 4 0 5 times the height of the barrier this is because the inundation depth increased after the collision exceeded the height of the barrier in the case of η bi h b the increase in the water depth in front of the barrier becomes relatively small beyond the overflow limit η bi η nb decreased as η nb h b increased because the damming effect of the barrier was weaker in this case the wave reflection from the barrier was less significant as the barrier height was small relative to the incident bore height in the case of η nb h b the maximum water surface elevations in front of barriers b1 b4 were nearly twice the height of the barriers η bi 2h b the influence of the barrier porosity on the amplification factor also decreased with increasing η nb h b 3 3 mitigation of tsunami inundation behind the barrier to evaluate the mitigation effect of the various barriers on the tsunami overland flow tests were conducted to record the variations in the inundation depth flow velocity and momentum flux in the offshore side of the barrier for different types of barriers and incident bore intensities the mitigation effect of the barrier on the inundation flow is represented by the inundation relative reduction r α b i which is defined as 1 r α b i α n b α b i α n b where α nb is the physical variable when no barrier exists nb while α bi indicates the corresponding variable when a barrier is installed b1 b5 the two variables α nb and α bi were measured at the same locations in the onshore side of the barrier a larger r α bi means a larger mitigation effect of tsunami inundation the relative reduction of each of the three variables depth velocity and momentum flux of the inundation flow showed different characteristics the reduction of the inundation depth varied significantly with the inundation depth of the incident bore and with the type of barrier the mean relative reduction in the maximum inundation depth at the three sites wg5 wg7 behind the barrier r η b i is shown in fig 7 2 r η b i a v e r a g e r η b i a t w g 5 r η b i a t w g 6 r η b i a t w g 7 where r η b i is the relative reduction in the maximum inundation depth by a barrier bi i 1 5 the relative reduction of the inundation depth decreased as η nb h b increased this was because the flow through the pores of the perforated barriers of b2 b4 and or the flow over the top of the barriers of b1 b4 increased as η nb h b increased the lower porosity barriers showed a higher relative reduction in the inundation depth for the same incident bore height barrier b4 with a porosity of 30 reduced the inundation depth by at least 30 when the height of the incident bore was less than about 70 of the height of the barrier whereas the relative reduction decreased to under 20 as the height of the incident bore approached the height of the barrier the impermeable barrier b1 showed the highest performance of reducing the inundation depth behind the barrier the hybrid barriers b2 and b3 showed good performance in reducing the inundation depth the seaward parapet attached to b2 had little effect on the reduction of inundation depth or on the amplification mentioned above the parapet couldn t check the inundation flow because the parapet had a blockage area that was much smaller than that of the other parts of the barrier little inundation reduction effect was expected of the horizontal rod barrier b5 because of the considerably smaller blockage area compared with the other barriers the difference in the relative reduction of the inundation depth according to the type of barrier decreased as the height of the incident bore increased and the flow over the top of the barrier became significant the relative height of the incident bore and the porosity of the barrier had a significant effect on the reduction of the inundation depth behind the barrier likewise the relative reduction of the maximum inundation flow velocity r v b i was significantly affected by the inundation depth of the incident bore and the type of barrier the velocity relative reduction r v b i was estimated by averaging the flow velocities measured at two sites vm2 and vm3 shown in fig 2 3 r v b i average r v b i a t v m 2 r v b i a t v m 3 the relative reductions of the maximum inundation velocity and maximum depth under identical conditions of incident bore and barrier are compared in fig 8 the value of r v b i was close to r η b i when the bore did not overflow the low porosity barriers b1 b3 however r v b i decreased to about half of r η b i when significant overflowing occurred thus for the low porosity barriers b1 b3 r v b i has a wider range than r η b i the decrease in r v b i due to overflow increased with decreasing porosity and consequently the mitigation of inundation flow velocity by b1 was as much as that by b4 cf dashed dotted lines in fig 8 the influence of barrier porosity on mitigation of inundation flow velocity became no significant when significant overflowing occurred at the barriers η nb h b 0 5 this characteristic of r v b i was different from that of r η b i the relative reduction of the momentum flux r η v 2 b i was generally higher than r v b i and r η b i fig 9 shows r η v 2 b i calculated from the inundation depths and flow velocities measured at two cross sections wg5 vm2 and wg7 vm3 the variations in r η v 2 b i were influenced by the relative inundation depth η nb h b and the types of barriers as in the case of r v b i and r η b i the barrier with 30 porosity caused a momentum reduction of about 40 even when a significant overflow occurred at the barrier η nb h b 1 0 r η v 2 b i tended to be higher overall compared to r v b i and r η b i the difference in r η v 2 b i between barriers b1 and b4 was smaller than those of r v b i and r η b i while the mitigation effects of the barriers on the momentum flux were influenced by η nb h b and the barrier cross section the low porosity barriers b1 b4 showed a relatively steady performance of reducing the momentum flux in comparison with the inundation depth and the flow velocity the results of this section indicate that the influence of inundation depth of the incident bore with respect to the barrier height η nb h b on the mitigation of inundation depth flow velocity and momentum flux is significant and needs to be considered for designing barriers under a wide range of tsunami overland flow 4 fluid force and impact of shipping container on the onshore barrier 4 1 fluid force acting on a barrier the characteristics of the fluid force generated by a tsunami overland flow with no driftage are examined to understand the relationship between the fluid force acting on the barrier and the decrease in inundation flow as in the case of the inundation depth the time series of the fluid force measured for identical test conditions were similar umeda et al 2014a the reliability of the fluid force data was generally acceptable under all the incident bore conditions in the bt test the fluid force acting on the barrier rapidly increased after the impact of the bore and reached an instantaneous maximum value of the fluid force f t e g ramsden 1996 linton et al 2013 next we examine the variation in f t and the relation to the inundation reduction for barriers b1 b5 the maximum fluid forces on the low permeable barriers b1 b4 were close to 0 4 0 8 times the momentum flux of the incident bore in the experiment the fluid forces normalized by the momentum flux are shown in fig 10 where f t and ρ are the fluid force per unit length of barrier and the density of water respectively the inundation depth η nb at wg4 and wave celerity c nb between wg4 and wg5 with no barrier installed shown in fig 3 were used to calculate the momentum flux the fluid force increased as the porosity of the barrier decreased and the incident bore increased the normalized fluid forces significantly changed depending on the conditions that was under or over the overflow limit this difference became larger with decreasing barrier permeability when no overflowing occurred the normalized fluid force acting on barriers b1 b4 varied between 0 45 and 0 85 the normalized force was significantly influenced by the type of barrier when overflowing occurred the effects of the relative height of the incident bore and the type of barrier on the normalized force were small sorting the results according to whether or not any overflowing occurred revealed that the maximum force normalized by the momentum flux generally converged to a certain value for the different types of barriers ex 0 43 for b1 0 38 for b4 the influence of the type of barrier on the normalized force was dominant the fluid force acting on the barrier was closely related to the mitigation of the momentum flux of the incoming overland flow a comparison between the relative reduction of the momentum flux behind the barrier and the ratio of the fluid force f t referred to as the fluid force ratio on barriers b2 b5 and the fluid force f t b1 on the impermeable barrier b1 is shown in fig 11 for an incoming bore of the same intensity the inundation reduction effect in the area behind the barrier clearly increased with the fluid force on the barrier with no barrier overflow at barriers b1 b4 the fluid force ratio f t f t b1 is very similar to r η v 2 b i when the incoming bore became high enough to cause barrier overflow the fluid forces on the permeable barriers b2 b4 and the impermeable barrier b1 were of similar value and r η v 2 b i declined the decrease in r η v 2 b i due to overflowing became more pronounced for the lower porosity barriers the barrier with 30 porosity b4 showed a small decrease in r η v 2 b i due to overflowing compared with the decreases for barriers b1 b3 therefore uniformly perforated barriers such as b4 should be able to reduce inundation in a wide range of tsunami intensities moreover the reduction in the maximum fluid force by b4 was beyond the level expected the fluid force acting on b4 was reduced to nearly 60 of the fluid force acting on b1 when no overflowing occurred this was mainly because the area of the barrier resisting the fluid force was reduced due to the porosity and the difference between the water levels in front of and behind the barrier became smaller because some of the water flowed through the holes the high correlation between r η v 2 b i and the fluid force ratio existed regardless of the type of barrier the influence of the relative inundation depth η nb h b on the fluid forces of the barriers became more significant as porosity of the barriers decreased for a seawall with no porosity thomas and cox 2012 derived an empirical equation to predict a reduction factor of maximum fluid forces on a building behind the seawall in their equation validated for use in large scale test the ratio of incoming bore height to seawall height was the most main parameter it can be considered that η nb h b has an important effect on the reduction of the fluid force on the barriers in general η nb can be determined from tsunami hazard maps thomas and cox 2012 and wave celerity c nb can be predicted by numerical simulations of tsunami run up in the absence of barriers therefore figs 6 10 will provide useful information for estimating mitigation effects of the barriers on tsunami overland flow and fluid force 4 2 interaction of a tsunami driven shipping container with the tsunami overland flow and the barrier the dynamic response of a shipping container to the tsunami overland flow varied significantly depending on the relationship between the incoming bore the shipping container and the barrier fig 12 shows variations in the maximum instantaneous velocity u max and the interval mean velocity u mean of a drifting container and the mean wave celerity c nb in the case of an open channel with no barrier the height of the shipping container h c was used as the normalizing length for a reliable value each tbc test was repeated ten times and the average used for the mean drift velocity the wave celerity of the incoming bore generally agreed with the curve described by formula 2 gη nb 1 2 and the results corresponded with the experimental results of mizutani et al 2005 for regular and solitary waves the drift velocity of the container gradually approached the wave celerity as the inundation depth increased and exceeded the draft depth of the container about 0 6h c the maximum velocity of the drifting shipping container roughly matched the wave celerity when the inundation depth reached about the same height as the shipping container the response of the shipping container placed between the seawall and barrier b4 with respect to the relative inundation depth is also shown in fig 12 the fully loaded container placed in the inundation zone did not move until it was flooded by the overland flow at a depth of about η nb 0 15h c as the water depth increased the container began to move but it did not impact on the barrier while η nb 0 45h c this was mainly because the container did not float but slid on its bottom surface the drifting container encountered the waves reflected from the barrier the effect of the reflected waves on the drifting behavior of the container is important in relation to the impact on wall type structures such as barriers which is different from the impact on columns and narrow structures e g nouri et al 2010 madurapperuma and wijeyewickrema 2013 ko et al 2015 significant impact between the container and the barrier occurred when the inundation depth was over about half the height of the container the drifting container mostly maintained its initial orientation and impacted on the barriers with its length nearly parallel to the barrier wall the angle of the collision between the container and the barrier was mostly below 10 the drifting container impacted barrier b4 and was trapped alongside the barrier while η nb 1 15h c as the inundation depth further increased the drifting container flowed past the barrier and drifted away to the onshore area behind the barrier in many cases at barrier b1 the container drifted past the barrier at a slightly lower inundation depth η nb 1 05h c the drifting behavior of the shipping container between the seawall and the barrier was affected mainly by the ratio of the relative inundation depth to container height and the type of barrier the drifting container approaching the barrier encountered the reflecting waves formed by the collision between the wave front propagating ahead of the container and the barrier this resulted in a deceleration of the driftage in front of the barrier the magnitude and range of the deceleration varied depending on the type of barrier and the intensity of the incoming bore as an example fig 13 shows the spatial variation in the velocity of the drifting container with the inundation depth reaching about half the height of the barrier η nb 0 52h b measured for the five barrier types the drift velocity shown in fig 13 is the ensemble average of ten measured values the drifting container collided with the horizontal wire barrier b5 with little deceleration as the interference caused by the reflection wave from the barrier was minimal hence the difference between the drifting and impacting velocities at b5 was small however at the low porosity barriers b1 b3 the drifting container encountered the waves reflected from the barrier wall deceleration started from a distance a few times the width of the shipping container which resulted in the drift velocity decreasing to about half of or less than the maximum value by the time the shipping container reached the front of the barrier the impact velocity of the shipping container was considerably reduced at the low porosity barriers on average the reduction effect of b4 on the impact velocity of the drifting container was roughly between the two extremes however the variability of the drifting velocity increased in the deceleration zone near the low permeable barriers because of the unsteady motion of the driftage caused by the interaction of the container with the reflecting wave consequently the velocity at the moment of impact on the barrier fluctuated widely resulting in a corresponding variable impact force acting on the barrier 4 3 influence of a tsunami driven container on the force acting on the barrier in the experiment the force acting on the barrier exposed to the tsunami overland flow associated with the tsunami driven shipping container instantaneously became much larger than f t the variability of the former force was also quite larger than that of the latter the difference between the two forces was strongly influenced by the type of barrier fig 14 compares the two forces under identical incident bore and barrier conditions the maximum instantaneous force caused by the tsunami overland flow with a drifting container hereafter referred to as the fluid driftage force f it was composed of the fluid force generated by the tsunami overland flow and the impact force generated by the drifting container on the barrier an example of the time series of the fluid driftage force acting on a barrier is shown in fig 15 the sudden rise denoted by f it in the time series of the force was due to the impact of the drifting container fig 14 shows f it measured repeatedly ten times for each set of conditions the variance in f it was larger than in the maximum instantaneous fluid force f t the coefficients of variation for all the measured data of f it and f t were 0 14 and 0 05 respectively this was mainly caused by the increase in the variability of the drifting container near the barrier the variations in the velocity and angle of collision between the container and the barrier were mentioned in section 4 2 f it was mostly larger than f t and for b5 f it was considerably larger than f t the variation of f it was considerable approximately 8 25 times that of f t while at the low porosity barriers b1 b4 f it generally remained within 1 2 times the value of f t f it can generally be lowered by selecting a lower porosity barrier however noting the large variance in f it this reduction can be affected by small differences in the parameters of the collision between the driftage and the barrier f it acting on barriers b1 b4 was within the range of the momentum flux of the incident bore whereas at b5 it was twice the momentum flux value the variation in f it at b1 b5 with respect to the relative inundation depth η nb h b is shown in fig 15 where f it 1 10 is the maximum value of ten repeated f it measurements normalized by the momentum flux of the incident bore f it 1 10 at b5 was about twice as large as that at b1 b4 this relation between f it and the permeability of the barriers is in contrast to that of f t discussed in section 4 1 at b5 f it1 10 was considerably larger than f t because the barrier was subjected to significant impact from the drifting container that did not decelerate much near the barrier in front of the less permeable barriers with a porosity of 30 or lower the water mass that formed the reflected waves see section 4 2 interacted with the drifting container lowering the impact velocity of the driftage arriving at the barrier thus the strong reflection of the wave from the low porosity barrier has a buffering effect on the impact of the container at the barrier the buffering effect is more pronounced at the low permeable barriers than at the high permeable ones this behavior is similar to that pointed out by matsutomi 1993 who measured the impact force of driftwood on a slotted wall in a laboratory experiment this supports our results that show that the impact force of an object driven by tsunami overland flow is influenced by the permeability of the impacted object many studies of tsunami driven objects impact force e g haehnel and daly 2002 2004 arikawa et al 2007 ko et al 2015 focused on evaluating maximum impact force on impermeable structures as functions of the impact velocity objects mass and the effective stiffness of the collision however there is insufficient knowledge on the relation among the impact velocity objects mass and effective stiffness discussion on the relative importance of impact force in total force acting on a barrier is needed for engineering design and understanding of dynamic process of the interaction between tsunami tsunami driven object and barrier for this purpose the explanations by using the inundation depths relative to the barrier and the container height are useful the increase in the force acting on an onshore barrier impacted by a tsunami driven shipping container varied considerably depending on the type of barrier and the intensity of the incident bore the difference between the fluid driftage force and the fluid force f it1 10 f t according to the relative inundation depth and type of barrier is shown in fig 16 f it1 10 f t was normalized by the weight m c g and the length of the shipping container l c to estimate the increase in the force per length of the shipping container as a result of the collision the difference force varied widely from about 0 2 to 10 times the weight of the fully loaded container the force generated by the impact of the driftage increased with the relative inundation depth although the low porosity barriers tended to suppress this increase the most suitable type of barrier for reducing the impact force varied depending on the relative inundation depth barrier b2 with the seaward attached parapet suppressed the increase in f it and kept it at about 0 7 1 3 times the weight of the shipping container when the height of the incident bore was about 70 100 the height of the barrier when the height of the incident bore was about half the height of the barrier the increase in f it was kept to about 0 7 times or less the weight of the shipping container at barriers b1 b4 but was quite large 3 10 times the weight of the shipping container at b5 the above results clearly show that the permeability of the barrier wall has an important influence on the impact force and fluid force 5 conclusions this study is one of the first studies to assess quantitatively the mitigation effects of onshore perforated barriers on the inundation the fluid force generated by an extremely large tsunami and the impact force generated by a tsunami driven object the main conclusions were drawn as follows the perforated barriers reduced the inundation depth amplified in the offshore side of the barriers because of mitigation of wave reflection the perforated barrier with 30 porosity reduced the inundation depth by 8 15 of the inundation depth at the unperforated barrier the mitigation effect of the barriers on the inundation in the onshore side of the barrier was significantly influenced by the ratio of the inundation depth of the incident bore to the barrier height and by the porosity of the barrier the perforated barriers showed consistently good performance in mitigating tsunami overland flow under a wide range of incoming bore height the perforated barrier of 30 porosity reduced the momentum flux by about 40 even when the incoming bore was as high as the barrier the maximum fluid force generated by the tsunami overland flow decreased with increasing porosity of barrier the maximum fluid force on the perforated barrier of 30 porosity was about 60 of the corresponding force on the unperforated barrier when no overflow occurred at the perforated barrier the effective decrease in the maximum fluid force due to barrier porosity was caused directly by the decrease in the surface area resisting the fluid force and indirectly by the flow through the holes in the perforated barrier which reduced the difference between the water levels at the front and rear of the barrier the correlation between the increase in the maximum fluid force and the decrease in the momentum flux of the inundation flow behind the barrier was high regardless of the type of barrier for the tsunami bore height below the overflow limit the relative reduction of the momentum flux was very similar to the ratio of the fluid force acting on the perforated barriers and the fluid force acting on the unperforated barrier the decrease in the inundation mitigation effect due to overflow was more pronounced in the low permeability barriers the barrier partially reflected the incoming bore the reflected wave interacted with the bore driven shipping container and reduced its drifting velocity near the barrier the perforated barriers with porosities of 30 or less buffered the impact of the drifting container and reduced the impact force the force acting on the barrier subjected to tsunami overland flow associated with a drifting shipping container increased with increasing barrier porosity the effects of barrier permeability on the impact force and fluid force were opposite the permeability of the barrier has an important effect on the level of mitigation of the inundation and the reduction of the fluid force and impact force this study carefully examined the relationships between the inundation reduction variations in the fluid force and impact force acting on perforated barriers and described the dynamic response of tsunami driftage to tsunami overland flow and the interaction with the barrier towards a comprehensive understanding of the level of protection from extremely large tsunamis provided by perforated barriers further research to expand the theoretical considerations of the relationship between tsunami mitigation and relevant forces is necessary to discuss hydraulic performance of the barriers more comprehensively as suggested by one of the reviews

23572,the hydraulic performance of onshore barriers in response to tsunami and a tsunami driven shipping container was examined experimentally for the barriers subjected to tsunami up to twice their designed height experiments with various barrier permeability were conducted to assess the mitigation effect and the concurrent forces on the barrier the perforated barrier with 30 porosity reduced the momentum flux of the inundation flow behind the barrier by 40 60 even when the water overflowed the barrier below the overflow limit the barrier reduced the fluid force acting on it by 40 of the corresponding force on the impermeable barrier the force on the perforated barrier was close to half the momentum flux of the incoming inundation the low permeability barrier buffered the impact of the drifting shipping container and reduced the impact force on the barrier the total force induced by the inundation flow associated with the driftage was reduced with decreasing permeability of the barrier the inverse relation between the impact forces acting on the high and low porosity barriers was in contrast to that of the fluid forces the permeability of wall type structures has an important influence on inundation mitigation and reduction of the fluid force and the impact force keywords coastal defense tsunami mitigation wall type structure wave force tsunami driftage impact force 1 introduction in tsunami prone areas it is important to consider the complexity and resilience of the coastal defense structures as well as effective plans for evacuation and land use based on the magnitude of the tsunami and the land use status and trends an extremely large tsunami will cause serious damage to coastal areas not only from the tsunami wave over the land but also from tsunami driven objects e g takahashi et al 2011 suppasri et al 2012 naito et al 2014 boats shipping containers cars timber and the like can drift into ports and coastal areas and cause damage to the surrounding areas in addition to that inflicted by the tsunami wave and obstruct the recovery effort thus measures to prevent damage from tsunami driven objects must be implemented along with prevention and mitigation of tsunami overland flow to ensure minimum safety standards in tsunami prone areas comprehensive multiple defenses against tsunamis and development of tough and resilient coastal defense structures are required this study focuses on the hydraulic performance of onshore perforated wave barriers which captured boats shipping containers and timber that drifted into a number of japanese ports and harbors after the huge tsunami caused by the 2011 great east japan earthquake fig 1 the perforated barriers were installed along the coast and outside ports where roads railways and buildings are located very close to the shore this type of barrier is used to reduce wave splash and spray over the top of seawalls and as a shield against wind and dust the structure consists of a wall of perforated sheet metal with holes a few cm in diameter creating a porosity of 30 40 supported by columns the tsunami height dataset of the 2011 tohoku earthquake tsunami joint survey group mori and takahashi 2012 shows that the perforated barriers were subjected to extremely high tsunami waves see fig 1 however while the perforated barriers captured tsunami driven objects they did not suffer any structural damage thus the permeability of the perforated barriers may act to lessen the force of the tsunami wave and reduce the damage caused by the wave and the tsunami driven objects while perforated barriers can protect against waves and tsunamis they are also compact and do not block the view of the ocean which is important for evacuation management unlike high solid walls perforated barriers have the advantage of retaining an open space feeling therefore perforated barriers can be part of a multi system protection scheme which uses existing coastal facilities and different methods of coastal disaster prevention some field observations e g kamikubo et al 2009 hirano et al 2013 fig 1 suggest that perforated wave barriers can be used as an effective measure to prevent and mitigate coastal flooding disasters however there have been no reports of a quantitative assessment of the mitigation effects of onshore perforated barriers on tsunami inundation and on the forces generated by tsunamis and tsunami driftage the effect of the impact forces of water driven objects on slender structures such as columns has been studied through experimental and theoretical research matsutomi 1993 1999 2009 investigated the collision behavior and impact forces of tsunami driven wood logs and proposed a practical evaluation formula for the impact force on a column haehnel and daly 2002 2004 performed steady flow experiments and showed that the maximum impact force of woody debris was a function of the impact velocity debris mass and the effective stiffness of the collision laboratory experiments of a shipping container exposed to tsunami flow over land were conducted by mizutani et al 2005 who investigated the fluid force on a shipping container on a wharf the drift velocity and the impact force on a slender column considering that the impact force is influenced by the material property and structural rigidity of the impacting and impacted objects arikawa et al 2007 measured the impact force between a large scale model of a concrete wall and a steel shipping container and found that the empirical formula based on the hertzian method was useful to evaluate the impact force recently ko et al 2015 conducted large scale experiments on the impact forces caused by in air and in water collisions between a column and a 1 5 scale shipping container they compared the results from the in air and in water tests to quantify the hydraulic effects on the debris impact force and duration a numerical investigation on the response of reinforced concrete columns to the impact of shipping containers was carried out by madurapperuma and wijeyewickrema 2013 however estimating the impact force of tsunami driven objects on a structure is complex because it is influenced by the various properties of the driftage and the structure haehnel and daly 2004 insufficient knowledge exists on the impact force of tsunami waves and driftage on permeable wall type structures and the hydraulic performance of the structures in response to these forces the forces acting on impermeable walls and columns as a result of simple tsunami overland flow with no driftage have been studied since the 1960s e g fukui et al 1963 cross 1967 ramsden 1996 fujima et al 2009 nouri et al 2010 recently several studies were conducted on the mitigation effects of various types of coastal defense structures oshnack et al 2009 and thomas and cox 2012 investigated low lying seawalls that helped reduce building damage in the 2004 indian ocean tsunami they conducted systematic experiments to quantify the reduction of the tsunami run up and force on a building behind a low lying seawall linton et al 2013 investigated the interaction between a solitary tidal bore and a wood frame wall at full scale using a large wave flume to understand how a flexible structure performs when subjected to tsunami overland flow and to evaluate the fluid force acting on the wall however inadequate investigations examined the interaction between tsunamis and perforated onshore structures though many studies were conducted on the interaction between storm waves and perforated coastal structures e g li et al 2006 huang et al 2011 elbisy 2015 many aspects regarding the interaction between tsunami overland flow tsunami driven objects and permeable structures such as perforated barriers are still unknown for effective mitigation of tsunami disasters in coastal areas a good understanding of the changes in the characteristics of the fluid forces and impact forces acting on permeable structures installed on land is needed the permeability of perforated barriers will change the characteristics of tsunami propagation including the reflection transmission and attenuation of the wave which affects the dynamic response and impact force of the tsunami driftage as it collides with the barriers in general high permeability decreases reflection and attenuation of wave and increase transmission the relations between wave propagation and force on barriers are not fully understood understanding of characteristics of inundation and impact is particularly important for design of barriers and development of effective defense from tsunami driven objects it is therefore necessary to understand the fundamental characteristics of the interactions between various structures and tsunami driven objects however almost no quantitative evaluations have been conducted on mitigating inundation and capturing tsunami driftage by onshore perforated barriers furthermore better knowledge of the hydraulic performance and responses of coastal structures subjected to tsunamis exceeding their designed load is important for developing safety measures against extremely large tsunamis the purpose of this study is to determine how onshore perforated barriers mitigate the tsunami inundation fluid forces and impact forces that act on them focusing on effects of variation in permeability of barriers and overflow at barriers this study complements the previous work of umeda et al 2014a 2014b experiments were conducted on five types of barriers installed on land behind a vertical seawall in a wide range of tsunami inundation where the inundation depth in front of the barriers varied from half to twice of the barrier height the results of the tests using impermeable and permeable barriers were compared to quantify the influence of the permeability of the barriers on the tsunami inundation fluid force and impact force in this paper we first examine the variation in the inundation levels offshore and onshore of the barriers and the fluid force acting on the barriers under various hydraulic and structural conditions and then discuss the relationship between the inundation reduction and fluid force changes second we examine the variation of the impact force due to a shipping container driven by tsunami overland flow and the total force due to the flow and the shipping container and discuss the characteristics of the impact force and the total force on various types of onshore barriers this paper provides a characterization of the fundamental physical process of the interaction between tsunami overland flow tsunami driftage and a coastal barrier as well as a careful assessment of the effects of various perforated barriers on tsunami mitigation and on the relevant forces 2 experimental setup procedures and conditions two series of laboratory experiments were carried out one replicated the interaction between tsunami overland flow and various types of barriers tb and the other modelled the interaction among tsunami overland flow a barrier and a tsunami driven shipping container tcb the tb test was conducted to estimate the fundamental hydraulic performance of various barriers exposed to tsunami inundation and the characteristics of the force of the fluid acting on each barrier the tcb test was conducted to investigate the behavior of a tsunami driven shipping container and the difference between the container impact force and the fluid force hereafter impact force means the force due to collision between a tsunami driven shipping container and a barrier and fluid force means the force due to tsunami alone consequently the forces measured in the tcb test consist of impact force and fluid force both tests were conducted under the same conditions of bathymetry structures and incident tsunami the experimental setup modelled a tsunami prone port and coastal areas on a scale of 1 50 2 1 open channel flume all the experiments were conducted using an open channel flume equipped with a slide gate as shown in fig 2 the channel was 12 m long and both the width and depth were 0 4 m the floor was horizontally fixed the gate was lifted in a single motion to instantly let in a large amount of water stored on the other side of the gate to generate a hydraulic bore the gate was located about 3 m offshore from the vertical seawall the land side of the vertical seawall was a dry horizontal floor the height of the floor surface was 0 105 m the uniform depth of the water at the seawall was 0 05 m the floors of the channel and the land were made of smooth painted metal both sides of the open channel flume were made of glass walls the downstream end of the flume was a free outlet 2 2 onshore barriers and shipping containers several types of onshore barriers were installed onshore 1 29 m from the seawall at x l 1 29 m fig 2 fig 3 shows the five types of vertical barriers tested in the experiments 1 a uniform impermeable wall b1 2 a perforated wall with 30 porosity with uniform holes on the upper half and an impermeable lower half with a seaward overhanging parapet attached to the top of the lower half of the wall b2 3 a half perforated half solid wall similar to b2 but without the parapet attachment b3 4 a wall of uniformly perforated steel sheet with a porosity of 30 b4 and 5 four thin horizontal steel rods lined up vertically b5 the model parameters of the barriers are summarized in table 1 in this study the porosity ε of each barrier was defined as the proportion of the area in the metal sheet taken up by holes the barriers were made of steel and the height h b and width b b were normalized to 0 06 m and 0 398 cm respectively in the tbc test a shipping container was placed between the leading edge of the seawall and the barrier fig 2 the shipping container was modelled as an international standard fully loaded 20 ft container the dimensions of the scaled model of the shipping container were length l c 12 cm height h c 5 2 cm and width b c 5 0 cm the mass of the container was 170 g the shipping container floating at rest had a draft of about 0 6 times its height the coefficient of static friction of the shipping container placed on the floor was adjusted to be about 0 5 the modelled shipping container was placed parallel lengthwise to the wave crest line and the normal line of the barrier the shipping container and vertical barriers were modelled on a 1 50 scale 2 3 instrumentation and data acquisition the time series of the water surface elevations were measured with capacity type wave gauges ch 604 cht6 40 kenek japan at the seven locations wg1 wg7 along the open channel flume fig 2 three propeller type current meters vo 301a vot2 100 05n kenek japan were used to measure the flow velocities at vm1 vm2 and vm3 the velocity at the leading edge of the tsunami front c nb i e the phase velocity or wave celerity was calculated from the time difference between the peaks of the water surface elevation measured at the different locations two stiff flat springs were installed at the foot of the two strong columns supporting the metal sheets of the barrier to measure the forces acting on the barriers the force was determined from the output of eight strain gauges attached on the front and reverse sides at the upper and lower sections of each spring the water depth flow velocity and force were measured simultaneously at a sampling frequency of 500 hz in the tb tests the measurement for each setting was repeated three times to ensure the reliability of the results the measured data was then averaged to consolidate the results in the tcb tests the drift velocity of the shipping container and the force acting on the barrier exposed to the tsunami overland flow and tsunami driven shipping container were measured simultaneously the drift velocity was derived from image analysis markers were attached to the shipping container model which was recorded from above by a digital high speed video camera has l1 ditect japan at 200 fps the particle tracking velocimetry ptv method was used to estimate the drift velocity the force acting on the barrier was measured using the same method described above to measure the fluid force the measurement for each setting in the tcb test was repeated ten times to calculate variation in the impact between the barrier and the container for barriers b1 and b4 the response of the shipping container to the tsunami overland flow was observed to find the condition that triggered the initial movement of the container and record the collision forces between the container and the barriers the forces and velocities of the drifting container and the inundation depth were measured when the container was stopped by the barriers these observations were also repeated ten times for reliability 2 4 test conditions the water depth in front of the seawall was fixed at 0 05 m and the test was run for four different levels of reservoir water depth h 1 that generated four different heights of hydraulic bore the test conditions are summarized in table 2 the normalized inundation water depth η nb h b and wave celerity c nb 2 2gh b on land at various locations along the channel flume with no barrier and no driven object case nb in the tb test for the four h 1 values are shown in fig 4 the inundation depth of the bore after running up the vertical seawall gradually decreased as the bore progressed further inland the inundation depth at the planned location of the shipping container x l 0 55 was about 30 120 of the height of the shipping container h c while the inundation depth at the planned location of the barrier x l 1 0 was about 25 110 of the height of the barrier h b the head of water as defined by the wave celerity was about twice the inundation depth around the planned locations of the container and barrier the froude number as defined by the flow velocity and inundation depth measured in the vicinity of x l 0 57 at wg3 and vm1 varied between 1 2 and 1 9 the model barrier was installed where the variations in the inundation depth and wave celerity were relatively small 3 hydraulic performance of the onshore barriers 3 1 bore propagation and time series data the propagation of the hydraulic bore generated by opening the reservoir gate was similar for each group of three tests repeated under the same conditions fig 5 shows an example of the time series of the inundation depths around the perforated barrier b4 exposed to tsunami overland flow caused by a bore generated with a reservoir water depth h 1 21 cm the right panels of fig 5 show a sequence of images showing impact of the bore on the barrier the inundation depths were measured three times under the same conditions each set of three repeated measurements exhibited good reproducibility and acceptable stability at all the measurement sites wg3 wg7 when the bore collided with and flowed over the seawall the water surface suddenly rose near the seawall and the bore front continued to travel over the land with the leading portion of the waves breaking umeda et al 2013 the inundation depth at site wg3 initially rose rapidly but then stabilized approaching a constant depth the maximum inundation depth of the incident bore before reflection wave from the barrier reached site wg3 corresponded to the maximum inundation depth of the same site when no wave barrier was installed η nb at wg3 in fig 5 the inundation depth at site wg4 increased to about double the maximum inundation depth η nb of the incident bore at about 1 5 s this was because the water level rose relatively quickly due to the reflected waves that formed when the bore impacted the barrier the water of the incoming bore was blocked at the barrier leading to a rise in the inundation depth at the offshore side of the barrier the water level rise at the barrier is referred to as damming effect of barrier due to the damming effect the inundation depths measured at sites wg5 wg7 in the onshore side of b4 was only about one third of the amplified inundation depth at the offshore side of the barrier both a rise and a drop of the inundation depth occurred at the barrier this behavior was stable throughout this series of experiments 3 2 amplification of tsunami inundation in front of barrier the increase in inundation depth caused by the damming effect of the barrier depends mainly on the permeability of the barrier and the strength of the tsunami overland flow the variation in the amplification factor of the inundation depth with respect to the relative inundation depth η nb h b and the type of barrier is shown in fig 6 the amplification factor is defined as the ratio of the maximum inundation depth of the water piled up against the offshore side of a barrier η bi i 1 5 barrier types to the maximum inundation depth of the incident bore η nb the lower porosity barriers produced a larger amplification factor of the inundation depth the inundation depth of the incident bore was amplified 2 2 5 times when the water reached barriers b1 b4 whereas it increased only slightly when reaching the horizontal rod barrier b5 comparison of the amplification factors of barriers b2 and b3 indicates that the seaward overhang parapet placed on b2 had no influence on the amplification of the inundation depth in front of the barrier η bi η nb varied with the porosity of the barrier and the inundation depth of the incident bore relative to the barrier height the overflow limit η bi h b is represented by the dashed line in fig 6 the limit line corresponds to the condition that the product of two variables in the vertical and horizontal axes of fig 6 is equal to one towards the upper right away from the line η bi h b the overflow becomes significant fig 6 shows that η bi η nb for b1 and b4 peaked on the line of overflow limit the amplification factor reach a maximum when the inundation depth after collision with the barrier was the same height as the barrier the maximum value of η bi η nb was 2 6 at the impermeable barrier b1 for b1 b4 barrier overflow occurred when η nb exceeded 0 4 0 5 times the height of the barrier this is because the inundation depth increased after the collision exceeded the height of the barrier in the case of η bi h b the increase in the water depth in front of the barrier becomes relatively small beyond the overflow limit η bi η nb decreased as η nb h b increased because the damming effect of the barrier was weaker in this case the wave reflection from the barrier was less significant as the barrier height was small relative to the incident bore height in the case of η nb h b the maximum water surface elevations in front of barriers b1 b4 were nearly twice the height of the barriers η bi 2h b the influence of the barrier porosity on the amplification factor also decreased with increasing η nb h b 3 3 mitigation of tsunami inundation behind the barrier to evaluate the mitigation effect of the various barriers on the tsunami overland flow tests were conducted to record the variations in the inundation depth flow velocity and momentum flux in the offshore side of the barrier for different types of barriers and incident bore intensities the mitigation effect of the barrier on the inundation flow is represented by the inundation relative reduction r α b i which is defined as 1 r α b i α n b α b i α n b where α nb is the physical variable when no barrier exists nb while α bi indicates the corresponding variable when a barrier is installed b1 b5 the two variables α nb and α bi were measured at the same locations in the onshore side of the barrier a larger r α bi means a larger mitigation effect of tsunami inundation the relative reduction of each of the three variables depth velocity and momentum flux of the inundation flow showed different characteristics the reduction of the inundation depth varied significantly with the inundation depth of the incident bore and with the type of barrier the mean relative reduction in the maximum inundation depth at the three sites wg5 wg7 behind the barrier r η b i is shown in fig 7 2 r η b i a v e r a g e r η b i a t w g 5 r η b i a t w g 6 r η b i a t w g 7 where r η b i is the relative reduction in the maximum inundation depth by a barrier bi i 1 5 the relative reduction of the inundation depth decreased as η nb h b increased this was because the flow through the pores of the perforated barriers of b2 b4 and or the flow over the top of the barriers of b1 b4 increased as η nb h b increased the lower porosity barriers showed a higher relative reduction in the inundation depth for the same incident bore height barrier b4 with a porosity of 30 reduced the inundation depth by at least 30 when the height of the incident bore was less than about 70 of the height of the barrier whereas the relative reduction decreased to under 20 as the height of the incident bore approached the height of the barrier the impermeable barrier b1 showed the highest performance of reducing the inundation depth behind the barrier the hybrid barriers b2 and b3 showed good performance in reducing the inundation depth the seaward parapet attached to b2 had little effect on the reduction of inundation depth or on the amplification mentioned above the parapet couldn t check the inundation flow because the parapet had a blockage area that was much smaller than that of the other parts of the barrier little inundation reduction effect was expected of the horizontal rod barrier b5 because of the considerably smaller blockage area compared with the other barriers the difference in the relative reduction of the inundation depth according to the type of barrier decreased as the height of the incident bore increased and the flow over the top of the barrier became significant the relative height of the incident bore and the porosity of the barrier had a significant effect on the reduction of the inundation depth behind the barrier likewise the relative reduction of the maximum inundation flow velocity r v b i was significantly affected by the inundation depth of the incident bore and the type of barrier the velocity relative reduction r v b i was estimated by averaging the flow velocities measured at two sites vm2 and vm3 shown in fig 2 3 r v b i average r v b i a t v m 2 r v b i a t v m 3 the relative reductions of the maximum inundation velocity and maximum depth under identical conditions of incident bore and barrier are compared in fig 8 the value of r v b i was close to r η b i when the bore did not overflow the low porosity barriers b1 b3 however r v b i decreased to about half of r η b i when significant overflowing occurred thus for the low porosity barriers b1 b3 r v b i has a wider range than r η b i the decrease in r v b i due to overflow increased with decreasing porosity and consequently the mitigation of inundation flow velocity by b1 was as much as that by b4 cf dashed dotted lines in fig 8 the influence of barrier porosity on mitigation of inundation flow velocity became no significant when significant overflowing occurred at the barriers η nb h b 0 5 this characteristic of r v b i was different from that of r η b i the relative reduction of the momentum flux r η v 2 b i was generally higher than r v b i and r η b i fig 9 shows r η v 2 b i calculated from the inundation depths and flow velocities measured at two cross sections wg5 vm2 and wg7 vm3 the variations in r η v 2 b i were influenced by the relative inundation depth η nb h b and the types of barriers as in the case of r v b i and r η b i the barrier with 30 porosity caused a momentum reduction of about 40 even when a significant overflow occurred at the barrier η nb h b 1 0 r η v 2 b i tended to be higher overall compared to r v b i and r η b i the difference in r η v 2 b i between barriers b1 and b4 was smaller than those of r v b i and r η b i while the mitigation effects of the barriers on the momentum flux were influenced by η nb h b and the barrier cross section the low porosity barriers b1 b4 showed a relatively steady performance of reducing the momentum flux in comparison with the inundation depth and the flow velocity the results of this section indicate that the influence of inundation depth of the incident bore with respect to the barrier height η nb h b on the mitigation of inundation depth flow velocity and momentum flux is significant and needs to be considered for designing barriers under a wide range of tsunami overland flow 4 fluid force and impact of shipping container on the onshore barrier 4 1 fluid force acting on a barrier the characteristics of the fluid force generated by a tsunami overland flow with no driftage are examined to understand the relationship between the fluid force acting on the barrier and the decrease in inundation flow as in the case of the inundation depth the time series of the fluid force measured for identical test conditions were similar umeda et al 2014a the reliability of the fluid force data was generally acceptable under all the incident bore conditions in the bt test the fluid force acting on the barrier rapidly increased after the impact of the bore and reached an instantaneous maximum value of the fluid force f t e g ramsden 1996 linton et al 2013 next we examine the variation in f t and the relation to the inundation reduction for barriers b1 b5 the maximum fluid forces on the low permeable barriers b1 b4 were close to 0 4 0 8 times the momentum flux of the incident bore in the experiment the fluid forces normalized by the momentum flux are shown in fig 10 where f t and ρ are the fluid force per unit length of barrier and the density of water respectively the inundation depth η nb at wg4 and wave celerity c nb between wg4 and wg5 with no barrier installed shown in fig 3 were used to calculate the momentum flux the fluid force increased as the porosity of the barrier decreased and the incident bore increased the normalized fluid forces significantly changed depending on the conditions that was under or over the overflow limit this difference became larger with decreasing barrier permeability when no overflowing occurred the normalized fluid force acting on barriers b1 b4 varied between 0 45 and 0 85 the normalized force was significantly influenced by the type of barrier when overflowing occurred the effects of the relative height of the incident bore and the type of barrier on the normalized force were small sorting the results according to whether or not any overflowing occurred revealed that the maximum force normalized by the momentum flux generally converged to a certain value for the different types of barriers ex 0 43 for b1 0 38 for b4 the influence of the type of barrier on the normalized force was dominant the fluid force acting on the barrier was closely related to the mitigation of the momentum flux of the incoming overland flow a comparison between the relative reduction of the momentum flux behind the barrier and the ratio of the fluid force f t referred to as the fluid force ratio on barriers b2 b5 and the fluid force f t b1 on the impermeable barrier b1 is shown in fig 11 for an incoming bore of the same intensity the inundation reduction effect in the area behind the barrier clearly increased with the fluid force on the barrier with no barrier overflow at barriers b1 b4 the fluid force ratio f t f t b1 is very similar to r η v 2 b i when the incoming bore became high enough to cause barrier overflow the fluid forces on the permeable barriers b2 b4 and the impermeable barrier b1 were of similar value and r η v 2 b i declined the decrease in r η v 2 b i due to overflowing became more pronounced for the lower porosity barriers the barrier with 30 porosity b4 showed a small decrease in r η v 2 b i due to overflowing compared with the decreases for barriers b1 b3 therefore uniformly perforated barriers such as b4 should be able to reduce inundation in a wide range of tsunami intensities moreover the reduction in the maximum fluid force by b4 was beyond the level expected the fluid force acting on b4 was reduced to nearly 60 of the fluid force acting on b1 when no overflowing occurred this was mainly because the area of the barrier resisting the fluid force was reduced due to the porosity and the difference between the water levels in front of and behind the barrier became smaller because some of the water flowed through the holes the high correlation between r η v 2 b i and the fluid force ratio existed regardless of the type of barrier the influence of the relative inundation depth η nb h b on the fluid forces of the barriers became more significant as porosity of the barriers decreased for a seawall with no porosity thomas and cox 2012 derived an empirical equation to predict a reduction factor of maximum fluid forces on a building behind the seawall in their equation validated for use in large scale test the ratio of incoming bore height to seawall height was the most main parameter it can be considered that η nb h b has an important effect on the reduction of the fluid force on the barriers in general η nb can be determined from tsunami hazard maps thomas and cox 2012 and wave celerity c nb can be predicted by numerical simulations of tsunami run up in the absence of barriers therefore figs 6 10 will provide useful information for estimating mitigation effects of the barriers on tsunami overland flow and fluid force 4 2 interaction of a tsunami driven shipping container with the tsunami overland flow and the barrier the dynamic response of a shipping container to the tsunami overland flow varied significantly depending on the relationship between the incoming bore the shipping container and the barrier fig 12 shows variations in the maximum instantaneous velocity u max and the interval mean velocity u mean of a drifting container and the mean wave celerity c nb in the case of an open channel with no barrier the height of the shipping container h c was used as the normalizing length for a reliable value each tbc test was repeated ten times and the average used for the mean drift velocity the wave celerity of the incoming bore generally agreed with the curve described by formula 2 gη nb 1 2 and the results corresponded with the experimental results of mizutani et al 2005 for regular and solitary waves the drift velocity of the container gradually approached the wave celerity as the inundation depth increased and exceeded the draft depth of the container about 0 6h c the maximum velocity of the drifting shipping container roughly matched the wave celerity when the inundation depth reached about the same height as the shipping container the response of the shipping container placed between the seawall and barrier b4 with respect to the relative inundation depth is also shown in fig 12 the fully loaded container placed in the inundation zone did not move until it was flooded by the overland flow at a depth of about η nb 0 15h c as the water depth increased the container began to move but it did not impact on the barrier while η nb 0 45h c this was mainly because the container did not float but slid on its bottom surface the drifting container encountered the waves reflected from the barrier the effect of the reflected waves on the drifting behavior of the container is important in relation to the impact on wall type structures such as barriers which is different from the impact on columns and narrow structures e g nouri et al 2010 madurapperuma and wijeyewickrema 2013 ko et al 2015 significant impact between the container and the barrier occurred when the inundation depth was over about half the height of the container the drifting container mostly maintained its initial orientation and impacted on the barriers with its length nearly parallel to the barrier wall the angle of the collision between the container and the barrier was mostly below 10 the drifting container impacted barrier b4 and was trapped alongside the barrier while η nb 1 15h c as the inundation depth further increased the drifting container flowed past the barrier and drifted away to the onshore area behind the barrier in many cases at barrier b1 the container drifted past the barrier at a slightly lower inundation depth η nb 1 05h c the drifting behavior of the shipping container between the seawall and the barrier was affected mainly by the ratio of the relative inundation depth to container height and the type of barrier the drifting container approaching the barrier encountered the reflecting waves formed by the collision between the wave front propagating ahead of the container and the barrier this resulted in a deceleration of the driftage in front of the barrier the magnitude and range of the deceleration varied depending on the type of barrier and the intensity of the incoming bore as an example fig 13 shows the spatial variation in the velocity of the drifting container with the inundation depth reaching about half the height of the barrier η nb 0 52h b measured for the five barrier types the drift velocity shown in fig 13 is the ensemble average of ten measured values the drifting container collided with the horizontal wire barrier b5 with little deceleration as the interference caused by the reflection wave from the barrier was minimal hence the difference between the drifting and impacting velocities at b5 was small however at the low porosity barriers b1 b3 the drifting container encountered the waves reflected from the barrier wall deceleration started from a distance a few times the width of the shipping container which resulted in the drift velocity decreasing to about half of or less than the maximum value by the time the shipping container reached the front of the barrier the impact velocity of the shipping container was considerably reduced at the low porosity barriers on average the reduction effect of b4 on the impact velocity of the drifting container was roughly between the two extremes however the variability of the drifting velocity increased in the deceleration zone near the low permeable barriers because of the unsteady motion of the driftage caused by the interaction of the container with the reflecting wave consequently the velocity at the moment of impact on the barrier fluctuated widely resulting in a corresponding variable impact force acting on the barrier 4 3 influence of a tsunami driven container on the force acting on the barrier in the experiment the force acting on the barrier exposed to the tsunami overland flow associated with the tsunami driven shipping container instantaneously became much larger than f t the variability of the former force was also quite larger than that of the latter the difference between the two forces was strongly influenced by the type of barrier fig 14 compares the two forces under identical incident bore and barrier conditions the maximum instantaneous force caused by the tsunami overland flow with a drifting container hereafter referred to as the fluid driftage force f it was composed of the fluid force generated by the tsunami overland flow and the impact force generated by the drifting container on the barrier an example of the time series of the fluid driftage force acting on a barrier is shown in fig 15 the sudden rise denoted by f it in the time series of the force was due to the impact of the drifting container fig 14 shows f it measured repeatedly ten times for each set of conditions the variance in f it was larger than in the maximum instantaneous fluid force f t the coefficients of variation for all the measured data of f it and f t were 0 14 and 0 05 respectively this was mainly caused by the increase in the variability of the drifting container near the barrier the variations in the velocity and angle of collision between the container and the barrier were mentioned in section 4 2 f it was mostly larger than f t and for b5 f it was considerably larger than f t the variation of f it was considerable approximately 8 25 times that of f t while at the low porosity barriers b1 b4 f it generally remained within 1 2 times the value of f t f it can generally be lowered by selecting a lower porosity barrier however noting the large variance in f it this reduction can be affected by small differences in the parameters of the collision between the driftage and the barrier f it acting on barriers b1 b4 was within the range of the momentum flux of the incident bore whereas at b5 it was twice the momentum flux value the variation in f it at b1 b5 with respect to the relative inundation depth η nb h b is shown in fig 15 where f it 1 10 is the maximum value of ten repeated f it measurements normalized by the momentum flux of the incident bore f it 1 10 at b5 was about twice as large as that at b1 b4 this relation between f it and the permeability of the barriers is in contrast to that of f t discussed in section 4 1 at b5 f it1 10 was considerably larger than f t because the barrier was subjected to significant impact from the drifting container that did not decelerate much near the barrier in front of the less permeable barriers with a porosity of 30 or lower the water mass that formed the reflected waves see section 4 2 interacted with the drifting container lowering the impact velocity of the driftage arriving at the barrier thus the strong reflection of the wave from the low porosity barrier has a buffering effect on the impact of the container at the barrier the buffering effect is more pronounced at the low permeable barriers than at the high permeable ones this behavior is similar to that pointed out by matsutomi 1993 who measured the impact force of driftwood on a slotted wall in a laboratory experiment this supports our results that show that the impact force of an object driven by tsunami overland flow is influenced by the permeability of the impacted object many studies of tsunami driven objects impact force e g haehnel and daly 2002 2004 arikawa et al 2007 ko et al 2015 focused on evaluating maximum impact force on impermeable structures as functions of the impact velocity objects mass and the effective stiffness of the collision however there is insufficient knowledge on the relation among the impact velocity objects mass and effective stiffness discussion on the relative importance of impact force in total force acting on a barrier is needed for engineering design and understanding of dynamic process of the interaction between tsunami tsunami driven object and barrier for this purpose the explanations by using the inundation depths relative to the barrier and the container height are useful the increase in the force acting on an onshore barrier impacted by a tsunami driven shipping container varied considerably depending on the type of barrier and the intensity of the incident bore the difference between the fluid driftage force and the fluid force f it1 10 f t according to the relative inundation depth and type of barrier is shown in fig 16 f it1 10 f t was normalized by the weight m c g and the length of the shipping container l c to estimate the increase in the force per length of the shipping container as a result of the collision the difference force varied widely from about 0 2 to 10 times the weight of the fully loaded container the force generated by the impact of the driftage increased with the relative inundation depth although the low porosity barriers tended to suppress this increase the most suitable type of barrier for reducing the impact force varied depending on the relative inundation depth barrier b2 with the seaward attached parapet suppressed the increase in f it and kept it at about 0 7 1 3 times the weight of the shipping container when the height of the incident bore was about 70 100 the height of the barrier when the height of the incident bore was about half the height of the barrier the increase in f it was kept to about 0 7 times or less the weight of the shipping container at barriers b1 b4 but was quite large 3 10 times the weight of the shipping container at b5 the above results clearly show that the permeability of the barrier wall has an important influence on the impact force and fluid force 5 conclusions this study is one of the first studies to assess quantitatively the mitigation effects of onshore perforated barriers on the inundation the fluid force generated by an extremely large tsunami and the impact force generated by a tsunami driven object the main conclusions were drawn as follows the perforated barriers reduced the inundation depth amplified in the offshore side of the barriers because of mitigation of wave reflection the perforated barrier with 30 porosity reduced the inundation depth by 8 15 of the inundation depth at the unperforated barrier the mitigation effect of the barriers on the inundation in the onshore side of the barrier was significantly influenced by the ratio of the inundation depth of the incident bore to the barrier height and by the porosity of the barrier the perforated barriers showed consistently good performance in mitigating tsunami overland flow under a wide range of incoming bore height the perforated barrier of 30 porosity reduced the momentum flux by about 40 even when the incoming bore was as high as the barrier the maximum fluid force generated by the tsunami overland flow decreased with increasing porosity of barrier the maximum fluid force on the perforated barrier of 30 porosity was about 60 of the corresponding force on the unperforated barrier when no overflow occurred at the perforated barrier the effective decrease in the maximum fluid force due to barrier porosity was caused directly by the decrease in the surface area resisting the fluid force and indirectly by the flow through the holes in the perforated barrier which reduced the difference between the water levels at the front and rear of the barrier the correlation between the increase in the maximum fluid force and the decrease in the momentum flux of the inundation flow behind the barrier was high regardless of the type of barrier for the tsunami bore height below the overflow limit the relative reduction of the momentum flux was very similar to the ratio of the fluid force acting on the perforated barriers and the fluid force acting on the unperforated barrier the decrease in the inundation mitigation effect due to overflow was more pronounced in the low permeability barriers the barrier partially reflected the incoming bore the reflected wave interacted with the bore driven shipping container and reduced its drifting velocity near the barrier the perforated barriers with porosities of 30 or less buffered the impact of the drifting container and reduced the impact force the force acting on the barrier subjected to tsunami overland flow associated with a drifting shipping container increased with increasing barrier porosity the effects of barrier permeability on the impact force and fluid force were opposite the permeability of the barrier has an important effect on the level of mitigation of the inundation and the reduction of the fluid force and impact force this study carefully examined the relationships between the inundation reduction variations in the fluid force and impact force acting on perforated barriers and described the dynamic response of tsunami driftage to tsunami overland flow and the interaction with the barrier towards a comprehensive understanding of the level of protection from extremely large tsunamis provided by perforated barriers further research to expand the theoretical considerations of the relationship between tsunami mitigation and relevant forces is necessary to discuss hydraulic performance of the barriers more comprehensively as suggested by one of the reviews

23573,the definition of thrust deduction in waterjet propulsion is different from that of a propeller driven hull and cannot be interpreted in the same way a particularly interesting feature of the waterjet thrust deduction is the large variation with froude number this is well known from experience but has never been fully explained the objective of this paper is to use cfd to address the reasons for these large variations to this end the thrust deduction fraction is split into resistance increment fraction and jet thrust deduction fraction the former is due to the self propelled hull resistance change in comparison with the bare hull resistance and the latter is due to the difference between gross and net thrust this split reveals that the main reason for the thrust deduction variation is the hull resistance change analysis of the resistance increment in different speed ranges is performed by studying the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic pressure changes on the hull as well as the friction change due to the waterjet system despite the negative thrust deduction fraction in the intermediate speed range there is no indication of a resistance reduction compared to that of the

waterjet propulsion concept is based on increasing the flow head through a pump inside a ducting channel and then discharging the ingested flow with a higher momentum flux behind the most common waterjet intake design is flush to the hull bottom however depending on the craft type the intake geometry can be ram or scoop shaped kruppa et al 1968 depending on the specific speed of the waterjet pump a mixed flow or an axial flow pump can be employed in the unit white 2008 within the speed range of 30 60 knots the major waterjet manufacturers suggest this propulsion method over conventional propellers since the waterjet unit is embedded in the hull the interaction effects between the waterjet system and the hull are quite different from those of conventional propellers in contrast with the propeller hull interaction effects which are rather well defined there are still unanswered questions regarding the waterjet hull interaction three major research studies in this field are the doctoral thesis by coop 1995 van terwisga 1996 and bulten 2006 coop investigated the interaction between waterjet and hull using model scale and full scale measurements as well as empirical and analytical methods he discusses the possible mechanisms contributing to the overall interaction effect and lists the waterjet momentum forces causing lift and moment about the centre of gravity the wake momentum losses and the loss of the planing surface at the intake opening as the most significant ones coop reports the largest measured negative thrust deduction fractions up to 8 around the hump speed he states that the ittc suggested method for towing the hull along the shaft line is the most conservative approach which yields the highest bare hull resistance in his doctoral thesis van terwisga 1996 showed that the thrust deduction fraction of a waterjet propelled hull varies considerably with speed and may even obtain negative values in an intermediate speed range through a set of analytical numerical and experimental studies he found a difference between gross thrust and net thrust 1 1 definition of gross thrust and net thrust are given in section 2 especially around ship speeds where the transom is not fully cleared he states that the difference is practically zero for higher speeds and therefore the difference between gross thrust and bare hull resistance is a good measure of the resistance increment of the hull due to the waterjet induced flow through an uncertainty analysis of propulsion tests he shows that the error made in the flow rate measurement in power estimation increases with decreasing jet velocity to ship velocity ratio he divides the effects causing the resistance change of a self propelled hull into a global sinkage trim effect and a local effect on the flow around the intake due to the ingested flow then he states that if the assumption of independence between the changes due to the local and the global flow is true the change in resistance may be estimated from a taylor series in the global and local flow parameters keeping only linear terms based on the measurements of a powerboat propelled by a single waterjet unit he concludes that the trim angle is the most important parameter for analyzing the resistance increment of the hull bulten 2006 studied the flow inside waterjet propulsion systems employing computational fluid dynamics cfd tools the integration of axial force component on the waterjet unit as well as a simplified version of the integral momentum balance equation were applied to calculate the waterjet thrust bulten reports a clear deviation between the results of these methods for higher ship speeds he also computed a large vertical force in the same speed range according to these findings bulten concludes that the method based on the momentum balance for the waterjet control volume is incorrect possibly because of the influence of the hull in the vicinity of the waterjet inlet and partly because of neglecting the contributions of the pressure distribution acting on the streamtube 2 2 see fig 1 and read the corresponding text for the definition of the streamtube the ittc high speed marine vehicle committee ittc 17 1987 and the ittc specialist committee on waterjets ittc 21 1996 ittc 22 1998 ittc 23 2002 ittc 24 2005 have proposed a test procedure for investigation of waterjet hull interaction which was modified during the years a measurement campaign was also conducted by the ittc specialist committee on waterjets on a semi displacement hull with two sets of axial flow waterjets the results of this study which was performed by many different institutes show a large scatter for the thrust deduction fraction this highlights the importance of the waterjet flow rate measurement the office of naval research rispin 2007 carried out a comprehensive set of measurements on a demi hull with a pair of waterjet units the difference of boundary layer thickness due to scale change was taken into account in the data scaling procedure consequently although the thrust deduction fraction in the intermediate speed range was positive at model scale taking this correction into account resulted in a negative thrust deduction fraction this conclusion raises the question of whether or not the thrust deduction is dependent on scaling kamal et al 2015 carried out an experimental comparative study of the powering of waterjet and screw propeller for a medium speed wave piercing catamaran they predict the thrust deduction fraction to be very low for the waterjet propelled hull 0 1 to 0 35 but no certain reason for the small values is provided several studies employing reynolds averaged navier stokes rans methods have been carried out modeling waterjet propelled hulls and including power estimation e g kandasamy et al 2010 2011 takai et al 2011 however the detailed waterjet hull interaction effects have not been the focus of these studies eslamdoost et al 2013 presented a method based on potential flow theory for studying the waterjet driven hull flow they also identified the parameters which contribute to the waterjet hull interaction in eslamdoost et al 2014 in their third consequent paper eslamdoost et al 2016 these authors investigated the difference between the net thrust and gross thrust of a waterjet unit through a rans study they show that the net thrust and the gross thrusts are not the same and deviate from each other especially in the speed range where the nozzle is submerged in the transom wave thus many researchers have contributed to the understanding of the waterjet hull interaction effects but yet there is a knowledge gap in explanation of the reasons for the large variation of the thrust deduction fraction with speed as well as of the negative thrust deduction values sometimes reported in the intermediate speed range the goal of the present paper is to study the thrust deduction fraction of a waterjet propelled hull in a wide speed range and to clarify the reasons for the large variation of this fraction in the following first the definitions required for the analysis of the waterjet system are introduced in section 2 then the hull geometry and the towing tank measured sinkage and trim are presented in section 3 and section 4 respectively a brief review of the computational technique for the waterjet flow simulation is given in section 5 and in section 6 the components which contribute to the thrust deduction fraction in different speed ranges are discussed in detail finally several conclusions are drawn 2 theory the thrust deduction fraction is the relation between the bare hull resistance and the thrust required to propel a vessel for a conventional propeller the net thrust is employed to define the thrust deduction fraction as follows 1 t p 1 r b h r a t n e t where r b h and t n e t are the bare hull resistance and the net thrust of the propeller s since the frictional resistance of the hull at model scale due to lower reynolds number is larger than the full scale frictional resistance a towing force is applied to the hull during the self propulsion test this force is called the rope force and is shown with r a in contrast to a propeller for which the net thrust is transmitted to the hull through its shaft line the net thrust of a waterjet unit is transmitted to the hull through the shaft line and the ducting channel the integrated geometry of the waterjet unit and hull makes it tricky to measure the net thrust directly in order to skip the impracticality of measuring the net thrust the ittc high speed vehicle committee ittc 17 1987 suggested to use gross thrust t g which is the momentum flux change through the waterjet control volume defined in fig 1 in the control volume shown in this figure surface 2 is part of the waterjet inflow streamtube no flow passes through this surface the capture area surface 1 is the cross section of the streamtube located far enough in front of the intake ramp tangency point before inlet losses occur ittc 21 1996 and as a practical solution the ittc specialist committee on the validation of waterjet test procedures recommends this section to be placed one inlet length forward of the ramp tangency point ittc 24 2005 the internal material boundaries of the waterjet system that extends to surface 1 and surface 2 is denoted with surface 6 surface 7 is the boundary area of the pump control volume and surface 8 represents the nozzle exit area the cross section of the jet where the mean static pressure equals the atmospheric pressure is called vena contracta and is indicated with surface 9 the vena contracta has the minimum jet cross sectional area the only surface shown in fig 1 that belongs neither to the waterjet control volume nor the hull is surface 4 this surface is enclosed by the stagnation line on the intake lip cut water and the line where the channel merges with the flat bottom surfaces 1 2 and 4 are flow dependent and can vary one operation condition to another the actual shapes of these surfaces are shown in fig 2 the horizontal component of the gross thrust vector can be obtained by writing the horizontal momentum flux balance over the control volume shown in fig 1 2 t g a 1 a 8 ρ u x u k n k d a where ρ is the density of the fluid u is the velocity vector and n is the unit vector normal to the control surface pointing outward of the control volume the einstein notation is used in equation 2 where index k ranges over 1 2 and 3 the total thrust deduction fraction of a waterjet propelled craft then can be based on the gross thrust as follows 3 t 1 r b h r a t g a collection of thrust deduction fraction data for different hulls has been obtained through self propulsion tests at marin for a wide variety of hulls with length to beam ratio varying from 3 to 15 see fig 9 the overall trend of this collection shows that t has large positive values in the low speed range small negative values in the intermediate speed range and then approaches small positive values in the higher speed range in this paper we will study the reasons for the variation of the thrust deduction fraction in different speed ranges to be able to proceed with this investigation some more definitions are explained in the following part considering the material boundaries of the waterjet system the net thrust t n e t is defined as the force vector acting upon the material boundaries of the waterjet system directly passing the force through to the hull van terwisga 1996 like the gross thrust in this paper the horizontal component of the net thrust vector will be called net thrust t n e t and is defined as 4 t n e t a 4 a 6 σ x d a v 7 ρ f p x d v where σ x is the x component of the surface stresses pressure and shear stresses and f p x is the x component of the pump force per unit mass as mentioned earlier it is a tricky task to measure the net thrust of a waterjet unit but with the aid of cfd it is possible to obtain the terms shown in equation 4 then the hull resistance increment fraction based on the net thrust of the waterjet unit would be as follows 5 t r 1 r b h r a t n e t according to the definitions presented in equation 3 and equation 5 the difference between the total thrust deduction fraction and the resistance increment fraction is the jet system thrust deduction fraction t j plus a second order term including t r and t j eslamdoost 2014 6 t t r t j t r t j where 7 t j 1 t n e t t g the jet system thrust deduction fraction represents the difference between gross thrust and net thrust a negative t j implies that net thrust is larger than gross thrust and vice versa the objective of the current paper is to explain the physics of the waterjet hull interaction in order to achieve this goal a reynolds averaged navier stokes rans solver is employed to compute the components of the thrust deduction fraction for a high speed hull the relative importance of t r and t j is studied and conclusions are drawn on the reasons for the variation of the thrust deduction fraction from displacement speeds to planing speeds including the intermediate speed range where the thrust deduction fraction is negative 3 hull and waterjet geometry the hull geometry used in this study is a test case designed at sspa the hull was 2 3 m long and for the self propulsion test it was equipped with a mixed flow waterjet pump and an intake designed by rolls royce the hull geometry and the positioning of the waterjet unit on the hull are shown in fig 3 note that the unit was mounted on the hull also in the resistance tests but then the intake opening was covered and the unit was filled with water to create the same initial conditions for the bare hull and self propelled one brown 2013 4 measurements resistance and self propulsion tests were carried out at sspa to provide data for validation of the numerical method and to determine the sinkage and trim under all conditions to increase the accuracy of the numerical computations the measured sinkage and trim was employed in the computations of the present paper the measured aft and fore draft of the bare hull bh and self propelled hull sp are plotted in fig 4 comparing the aft draft of the self propelled hull with that of the bare hull it is seen that the transom submergence of the waterjet driven hull is larger than the bare hull transom submergence for the entire measured speed range the sinkage and trim values of bh and sp can be calculated using the fore and aft drafts fig 5 shows the sinkage of the hulls at mid ship the waterjet propelled hull sinks deeper due to the action of the waterjet unit eslamdoost et al 2013 the measured trim angle of the bare hull and self propelled hull is plotted in fig 6 at the intermediate and higher speed ranges fn 0 6 there is a bow down trimming moment which causes the self propelled hull to trim less than the bare hull since the aft part of the waterjet driven hull submerges deeper at the lower speed ranges the trim angle of the self propelled hull becomes larger than that of the bare hull 5 computational method the numerical simulations presented in this paper are carried out employing the code star ccm 8 02 that uses a finite volume method to solve the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations and the continuity equation in integral form the realizable k ε turbulence model with wall function is used to solve the turbulence effect on the mean flow the tracing of the free surface is done using the volume of fluid method vof in combination with the high resolution interface capturing hric scheme to discretise the convective term of the volume fraction transport equation muzaferija and perić 1999 this scheme is suitable for tracking sharp interphase of an immiscible phase mixture and resolves the free surface within typically one cell since the flow features inside the waterjet pump is not the focus of this study a body force model is employed instead of modeling the actual geometry of the waterjet pump to reduce the computation costs thus the impeller blades and the stator guide vanes are removed in this approach as far as the body force induced head rise through the pump is equal to that of the actual pump the average flow would be the same as if the actual pump geometry was simulated the body force magnitude is equal to the resistance of the entire system including the hull and the ducting channel minus the rope force applied to the hull during the self propulsion tests for unloading the water jet in the computations the body force is inserted as an axial source term into the momentum equation and is distributed uniformly inside the volume which surrounds the impeller a thinner or thicker region can be used for distribution of the body force but it should be kept in mind that the volumetric integral of the body force inside this region should balance the other forces acting on the entire system in order to achieve a more stable numerical convergence the thickness of this region should be such that the flow accelerates gradually instead of an abrupt acceleration that may happen with the use of a very thin region in order to eliminate the uncertainties of sinkage and trim measured values have been used in the computations it is assumed that the flow around the hull is symmetric and therefore just the half the hull model is used in the simulations the computational domain is extended 1 5 lpp in front of the hull and 4 5 lpp behind it the lower boundary of the domain is 2 5 lpp below the undisturbed free surface and the upper 1 5 lpp above the undisturbed free surface level the width of the computational domain is 2 5 lpp inlet velocity boundary conditions are used for all far field boundaries except the downstream boundary where pressure outlet is applied a systematic variation of the domain size showed that the pressure and frictional resistance components varied less than 1 when the domain size was enlarged by a factor of 3 this ensures the results are not depending on the domain size the mesh used for the simulations consists of unstructured surface mesh prism layers and core mesh prism layers are employed to resolve the boundary layer and hexahedral cells outside the boundary layer grid form the core mesh the hexahedral cells are aligned with the direction of the undisturbed flow see fig 7 the surface mesh and the symmetry plane mesh in the aft part of the hull are shown in fig 8 anisotropic mesh refinement in three different levels are used close to the undisturbed free surface and a finer mesh is employed around the waterjet intake as well as around the discharged jet to capture the details of the flow in these regions the mesh size and mesh distribution around the hull are kept almost the same between the waterjet propelled hull and the bare hull for the consistency of the simulations a systematic grid refinement study was carried out for the bare hull and self propelled hull grids to obtain a suitable cell size and hence total grid number see eslamdoost et al 2015 and eslamdoost et al 2016 respectively the formal verification of the resistance and thrust coefficients is presented in these two papers the total number of cells for the bare hull and the self propelled hull were 3 7 e 6 and 5 7 e 6 respectively based on the least squares root method by eça and hoekstra 2014 a numerical uncertainty of 2 3 was computed for both grids the bare hull resistance the self propulsion volumetric flow rate and the gross thrust are validated against the measured values in eslamdoost et al 2016 the average discrepancy between the computed and the measured bare hull resistance in the froude number range of 0 2 1 6 is less than 4 the computed flow rate and the gross thrust are under predicted by less than 3 and 8 in comparison to the measured values respectively 6 analysis of the thrust deduction in order to compute the thrust deduction fraction as shown in equation 3 it is required to compute the bare hull resistance and the gross thrust for which the momentum flux through the capture area and nozzle exit are needed the procedure for computing the capture area geometry is explained in eslamdoost et al 2016 where the computed bare hull resistance and the gross thrust for the froude number range between 0 2 and 1 4 and are also presented based on these computed values the thrust deduction fraction is plotted in fig 9 along with collected thrust deduction fractions shown in fig 2 the trend seen in the computed t is practically the same as in the collected values the resistance increment fraction t r can be obtained from equation 5 in fig 10 the t and t r curves are plotted together there is an almost constant shift between t and t r at all froude numbers but the smallest one the reasons why the shift is larger here is explained in eslamdoost et al 2016 all features of the t variation with speed the high values at low speed the rapid drop near the froude number where the transom clears the low values in the intermediate speed range and the increase at higher speeds are caused by the variation of t r it is the variation of the self propelled hull resistance that causes the variation of the thrust deduction fraction therefore the following discussion will focus on t r 6 1 resistance increment the components of the resistance are obtained by splitting the total resistance into the resistance of the transom and the resistance of the rest of the hull which in the following discussion is mentioned as hull the waterjet unit is excluded from the self propelled hull but the intake and exit openings are on the hull and the transom the resistance of the hull and the transom individually are split into the pressure resistance and the frictional resistance where the pressure resistance in turn is split into the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic resistance this split is shown in a flowchart form in fig 11 assuming that sinkage trim and the local flow changes independently influence the resistance change the resistance increment of the hull may be estimated from a linear expansion in a taylor series and expressed as follows van terwisga 1996 8 δ r q σ τ r σ q 0 σ 0 τ 0 d σ r τ q 0 σ 0 τ 0 d τ r q q 0 σ 0 τ 0 d q where r is the hull resistance and q σ and τ are the flow rate through the ducting channel the hull sinkage and the hull trim angle respectively index 0 denotes the bare hull the bare hull equilibrium position is the reference point about which the taylor expansion is made obtaining the partial derivatives of resistance with respect to sinkage trim and flow rate individually the contribution of each of them to the resistance increment may be estimated the combined effect of sinkage and trim can be called global flow pattern change and the contribution of the flow change around the intake can be referred to as local flow change the effect of the global flow change on the resistance can be obtained by introducing a bare hull which has the same sinkage and trim as the waterjet propelled hull also the comparison of the resistance between this new hull with the self propelled hull enables to identify the explicit effect of the waterjet induced flow local effects on the hull resistance increment in the following the notation bh and sp are used for identification of bare hull and self propelled hull respectively and the notation bhsp is used for bare hull with the same sinkage and trim as the self propelled hull the way that the global and local effects are obtained is schematically shown in fig 12 for the following discussion three froude numbers have been selected each one representing an interesting speed range in fig 10 the froude numbers are 0 2 0 8 and 1 4 based on the resistance components presented in fig 11 and the global and local flows resistance increments defined in fig 12 results for the three selected froude numbers are discussed in the following sections 6 1 1 lower speed range 0 20 fn 0 47 the resistance increment fraction curve can be divided into two distinct regions in the low speed range as shown in fig 10 in the speed range between froude number 0 2 and 0 43 the t r curve slope is negative but is not as steep as the part of the curve between froude numbers 0 43 and 0 47 in fact these froude numbers are the transom clearance froude numbers for the self propelled hull and the bare hull respectively this indicates that the resistance increment is directly associated with the critical froude numbers of the hulls where the transom becomes dry the resistance increment in these two regions and the influence of the transom clearance on t r are discussed in the following 6 1 1 1 0 20 fn 0 43 the resistance increment fraction has large positive values in this speed range and decreases with froude number at an almost constant rate until the transom of the waterjet driven hull clears water at froude number 0 43 fig 13 shows the hull and the transom resistance increment components at froude number 0 2 due to the global local and total effects in a schematic form the flags in this figure represent the resistance increment in newtons due to each resistance component separately a backward pointing flag indicates an increased resistance component and vice versa in the following the reasons behind the magnitude and sign of each component are discussed global effects starting with the study of the global effects it is seen that the hydrostatic resistance of the transom decreases 1 0 n while it increases on the hull 1 1 n the different signs of the hydrostatic resistance increment on the transom and the hull are due to the normal vectors of these surfaces which have their axial components in opposite directions the main reason for the hydrostatic resistance change at this speed is the deeper sinkage of bhsp compared to bh 1 5 m m at mid ship see fig 5 which increases the projected area of the hull and transom below the undisturbed free surface since the hull does not trim at this speed the increase in the projected area of the transom and hull should be the same however it is seen that the hydrostatic resistance reduction due to the pressure on the transom is smaller than the increase on the hull this is caused by the lower water level at the transom for bhsp the slightly deeper transom edge causes a reduction in hydrodynamic pressure when the flow passes across the edge this reduces the hydrodynamic pressure in the whole massively separated flow behind the transom causing the water level to drop hence a smaller area for the hydrostatic pressure to act on since there is a minor increase in the transom submergence of bhsp the hydrodynamic pressure resistance of the transom slightly increases 0 1 n due to the lower hydrodynamic pressure acting on the transom despite the deeper sinkage of bhsp the hydrodynamic resistance of the hull does not change at this speed the hull sinks by 1 5 m m at mid ship and the corresponding displacement change is 2 as a rough estimate the resistance may be assumed proportional to the displacement therefore there would be 2 increase in the hydrodynamic resistance of the hull at this speed but since the hydrodynamic resistance of the hull is so small from the beginning 0 6 n the anticipated 2 increase is negligible the frictional resistance of the transom is zero since the transom is practically at right angles to the x axis the change between the wetted surface areas of bhsp and bh is very small and therefore the frictional resistance increment of the hull due to the global effects is also zero local effects to study the local flow effects the sp and of bhsp resistance components are compared since these hulls have same sinkage trim the only cause which can change the hydrostatic force component on the transom can be the waterjet system an important effect that influences the pressure distribution on the transom as well as the pressure in the vicinity of the transom edge is the jet entrainment therefore before starting the analysis of the resistance changes due to local effects the physics of the jet entrainment and its influence on the hydrodynamic and hydrostatic pressures are discussed the hydrodynamic pressure coefficient on bhsp and sp as well as the streamlines behind the transoms of these hulls are shown in figs 14 and 15 respectively as seen in fig 15 the discharged jet entrains the dead water behind the transom therefore the flow at the transom edge bends towards the transom hollow faster to replace the entrained water the faster turn of the flow means that the curvature of the streamlines leaving the transom edge is larger compared to the curvature of the bare hull streamlines the larger curvature of the streamlines means that the hydrodynamic pressure is lower at the transom edge on the average c p is about 0 03 lower for sp at the transom edge see eslamdoost 2014 and thereby also on the entire submerged transom this leads to a lower water level at the transom and thereby to a smaller hydrostatic pressure force having explained the effect of jet entrainment on the hydrodynamic and hydrostatic pressure distributions on the transom we will now proceed with the discussion of the resistance increments due to the local effects the reduction of the hydrostatic pressure force on the transom due to jet entrainment causes a slight increase in hydrostatic resistance 0 3 n a larger contributor is the missing area of the nozzle exit which contributes 0 8 n out of the total increase of 1 1 n see fig 13 the hydrostatic resistance of the hull due to the local effects also increases by 0 5 n mostly caused by the missing surface covering the intake opening since this surface is facing backwards at this low froude number removing the surface will cause an increased hydrostatic resistance as explained above the jet causes a decreased hydrodynamic pressure on the transom which yields an increase in resistance by 1 1 n the hydrodynamic pressure resistance of the hull also increases as a result of the local effects 0 2 n the reason is not the missing surface at the intake opening which has a negligible contribution to this effect rather it is the induced flow over the hull caused by the intake suction that gives this small resistance increase the frictional resistance increment of the transom due to local effects is zero since the transom is practically at right angles to the x axis this resistance component on the hull decreases 0 1 n due to the missing area of the intake opening all effects a direct comparison of sp and bh resistance components is also made in fig 13 interestingly the sum of the resistance components due to the global and the local effects are equal to the components obtained directly by comparing the resistance change between bh and sp this finding supports the hypothesis that the resistance increment of the hull is a linear function of sinkage trim and flow rate equation 7 the sum of all the resistance components at this speed becomes rather large compared to the bare hull resistance 5 1 n this is the reason for the large positive t and t r in the lower speed range the total resistance of the self propelled hull compared to the bare hull increases by 58 8 of which the local effects contribute 54 9 only 3 9 is due to global effects the resistance increment fraction t r is very large 0 37 of which 0 34 is due to local effects 6 1 1 2 0 43 fn 0 47 in the speed range to be discussed in this section t r drops abruptly from large positive values to values close to zero in this study it is discovered that the sudden change occurs in the speed range between the critical froude number for transom clearance of the self propelled hull and that of the bare hull in the following first the possible causes that may result in the earlier transom clearance of the waterjet driven hull are discussed and afterwards the reasons for the sharp drop of the t r value are explained both measurements and computations show that the critical froude number where the transom becomes dry differs between the towed hull and the waterjet propelled one table 1 shows the measured and computed critical froude numbers for both hulls note that the ranges shown for the measurements and computations are given by the step in froude number the step was smaller in the experiments hence a smaller range although the computed wetted surface area of the hull is very similar to the towing tank result the critical froude number is under predicted in the computations compared to the measured ones which can also be seen from the computed bare hull free surface in comparison to the towing tank results fig 16 according to both the measurements and computations the transom of the waterjet driven hull clears earlier than the bare hull as seen in fig 16 while the bare hull transom is still wet foamy region behind the transom the waterjet propelled hull has cleared water glassy surface behind the transom the evolution of the computed transom wetted surface area for the bare hull and the waterjet propelled hull is plotted in fig 17 there are several reasons why the self propelled hull has an earlier transom clearance than the bare hull but it cannot be due to transom draft changes since sp has a larger transom draft than bh deeper transom submergence causes a later transom clearance in order to show that the earlier clearance of sp is caused by local effects a set of simulations was carried out for sp and bhsp the results from this set of simulations are presented in the following fig 18 shows the contour plot of sp and bhsp wave height at f n 0 434 the wave patterns of these two cases are very different behind the transom the aft part streamlines on the symmetry plane can be compared in fig 19 despite the equal sinkage and trim for both cases the bare hull transom is wet and transom of the self propelled hull is dry a recirculating zone is noted behind the transom of the bare hull whereas no such recirculating zone can be observed in the self propelled case we believe this to be an effect of the high momentum jet flow which pushes the dead water flow behind the transom downstream and eliminates the breaking waves filling the hollow behind the transom at froude numbers just below the critical one the second reason for the delay in transom clearance of sp is the boundary layer development behind the waterjet intake low momentum boundary layer flow is sucked into the waterjet unit and then expelled out far beyond the transom the boundary layer developing on the bottom behind the intake is thus thinner than for the bare hull fig 20 shows the axial velocity at the transom edge on three vertical lines positioned in different transverse distances from the hull symmetry plane for both the bare hull and the waterjet driven hull the axial velocity at the transom edge is larger for sp compared to bhsp the largest difference between these hulls is seen at the transom centreline this means that the flow leaving the waterjet propelled hull transom edge has a higher momentum and therefore the stern wave is less prone to breaking a third effect may be envisaged considering fig 21 which compares the wave cut at y l p p 0 243 for bhsp and sp at the same froude number due to the suction of the waterjet unit the wave height is lowered on the sides of the hull in the aft part starting near the capture area section x l p p 0 71 and therefore part of the flow which could fill in the hollow behind the transom from the sides is removed these three effects result in an earlier transom clearance of the waterjet driven hull in comparison to the bare hull the effect of the different critical froude numbers on the resistance increment is discussed in the following section during the resistance tests of the hull used in this study it was discovered that there is an abrupt peak in the resistance coefficient of the bare hull at the critical froude number the reasons for the peak were investigated using cfd and presented in eslamdoost et al 2015 further studies of the self propelled hull revealed the existence of the same peak in the resistance coefficient of the waterjet driven hull as appears in fig 22 since the self propelled hull has a lower critical froude number the peak is shifted to the left it is this shift that causes the rapid drop in t r replacing resistance by c t in equation 5 yields t r 1 c t b h c t s p employing this equation in combination with the data given in fig 22 it is it is seen that t r is large and positive at the critical froude number of the self propelled hull thereafter dropping to zero at the froude number where the two curves meet this explains the abrupt drop in the resistance increment fraction curve of fig 10 6 1 2 intermediate speed range 0 47 fn 1 00 as seen in fig 10 the resistance increment fraction is close to zero in the intermediate speed range 0 47 f n 1 00 the speed in this range is beyond the critical froude numbers of the bare hull and self propelled hulls and therefore there is no hydrostatic or hydrodynamic force acting on the transom it is the change of forces acting on the hull that contribute to the resistance increment see fig 23 global effects the global contribution to the hydrostatic pressure resistance increment of the hull is 2 2 n the deeper sinkage of bhsp compared to bh 6 m m at mid ship see fig 5 increases the hydrostatic pressure acting on the hull but despite such an increase the smaller trim angle of bhsp 0 2 less positions the hull such that the imbalance between the hydrostatic pressure force acting on the fore and aft parts of the hull diminished this is the reason for the reduced hydrostatic pressure resistance due to the global effects the hydrodynamic pressure resistance increment due to the global effects is 7 8 n the reason is the deeper sinkage which gives an increased displacement and thereby a higher hydrodynamic pressure on the bottom comparing bhsp and bh it is seen that the increased sinkage and decreased trim angle result in increased wetted surface area of the hull and therefore the frictional resistance of bhsp increases 0 6 n local effects the local effects cause a reduction in the hydrostatic pressure resistance of the hull 5 1 n the missing intake opening area is the major part of this reduction 4 9 n the trim angle of the hull at froude number 0 8 is about 3 8 see fig 6 this positions the intake opening surface such that the hydrostatic force acting on this surface has an axial component pointing backward the hydrostatic pressure resistance of sp decreases by removal of this surface the rest of the hydrostatic pressure resistance increment due to the local effect 0 2 n is caused by the intake induced flow which alters the waves close to the aft part of the hull the local effects contribution to the hydrodynamic pressure resistance increment influences the resistance by 1 1 n because of the missing intake surface subtracting the hydrodynamic pressure resistance of sp and bhsp and integrating the hydrodynamic pressure on the area of the intake opening of bhsp results in the same number this can be considered as a confirmation that the intake opening is the only important factor which influences the hydrodynamic pressure resistance of the hull the missing surface of the intake opening decreases the frictional resistance of sp 1 2 n total effects like in the lower speed range in the intermediate speed range the sum of the resistance increment components due to the global and local effects are equal to the directly computed resistance increment components at this operating froude number the hull hydrostatic hydrodynamic and frictional resistances vary such that the sum of all these variations becomes almost zero and that is the reason for obtaining near zero resistance increment fraction in the intermediate operating speed range 6 1 3 high speed range 1 0 fn 1 4 the resistance increment fraction gradually increases and has positive values in this speed range fig 10 the bh sp and bhsp resistance increment components at f n 1 4 are given in fig 24 each of these resistance increment components is discussed in the following subsections global effects the sinkage of bhsp is larger compared to bh 11 m m deeper at mid ship see fig 5 and due to the bow down trimming moment of the waterjet the hull trims less 0 2 see fig 6 the combination of these two effects results in an increased hydrostatic pressure on the hull due to the trim angle of bhsp at this speed 3 9 the x component of the surface normal points forwards and therefore the resultant force caused by the increased hydrostatic pressure on the hull will point backwards resulting in a slight increase of the hull hydrostatic pressure resistance 0 8 n as stated in the previous paragraph bhsp sinkage is larger compared to bh which increases the displacement the increased hydrodynamic pressure resistance due to the global effects 14 9 n is a result of the increased displacement the wetted surface area of the bhsp increases by almost 5 9 because of the changed sinkage and trim of the hull this results in 2 3 n increase in the frictional resistance of the hull local effects removing the contribution of the hydrostatic pressure force acting on the intake opening will decrease the resistance this is the reason for the negative hydrostatic pressure resistance increment at this speed 5 0 n like in the previous speed range the surface normal of the intake opening at f n 1 4 is pointing forward since the hydrodynamic pressure is negative in the vicinity of the opening the removal of a surface from this region results in an increased hydrodynamic pressure resistance but only a trivial proportion of the total reduction of the hydrodynamic pressure resistance by the local effects is caused due to the missing intake opening area 0 1 n out of 2 0 n this means that the local effects alter the hydrodynamic pressure resistance of the hull mainly through the intake induced flow which changes the waves around the hull the altered pressure distribution around the intake opening on sp is noticeable comparing to bhsp the missing intake opening surface causes a decrease in the wetted surface area of the hull by 6 3 resulting in 4 3 n decrease in the frictional resistance of the hull total effects the total resistance increment is obtained by comparing the resistances of sp and bh as seen in fig 24 like for the other speed ranges the total resistance increment is equal to the increment which is obtained through the superposition of the global and local effects the sum of all resistance increment components vary such that the total resistance increases in the higher speed range among all the components the hydrodynamic pressure resistance of the hull is the dominating one 6 2 difference between t and t r so far the causes of thrust deduction fraction variations in different speed ranges have been discussed through analyzing the resistance increment fraction which dictates the trend of the t curve fig 10 the gap between the t and t r curves is caused by the difference between the waterjet net thrust and gross thrust and as shown in equation 6 is equal to t j t r t j the difference between the waterjet net thrust and gross thrust is discussed in eslamdoost et al 2016 where the difference is divided into two main components intake drag d i and exit drag d e intake drag is the x component of the force acting on the capture area and the stream tube and exit drag is the x component of the force acting on the nozzle exit see fig 2 the jet thrust deduction fraction t j is obtained from the difference between the gross and net thrust divided by the gross thrust implicit formula 9 t j t g t n e t t g it can also be obtained from the sum of the intake and exit drag explicit formula 10 t j d i d e t g the jet thrust deduction fraction using both the implicit and explicit formulas is shown in fig 25 despite the fact that the implicit t j is obtained from subtraction of two large numbers and the explicit one is obtained from summation of two small numbers both approaches predict almost the same value except in the low speed range where the nozzle exit is not ventilated t j is small the resistance increment fraction is also small in this speed range fig 10 and therefore the second order term in equation 6 becomes negligible as assumed by the ittc waterjet specialist committee ittc 24 2005 however this is not a valid assumption if the waterjet is operating in the low speed range where the second order term becomes as important as the other terms in equation 6 we have all the components on the right hand side of equation 6 and therefore the total thrust deduction fraction obtained through this equation can be compared with t computed directly from its definition equation 3 the results of these two approaches as well as the case which the second order term neglected are shown in fig 26 the thrust deduction fraction computed from these different approaches are in a good agreement with each other this verifies the approach that we have used for decomposing the components of thrust deduction fraction also the importance of taking the second order term in equation 6 into account in the low speed range is clearly seen in this figure disregarding this term will result in under prediction of t at lower speeds 7 conclusions the motivation of this work was to understand the reasons behind the varying thrust deduction fraction at different speed ranges thus the thrust deduction was investigated in detail over a large froude number range it was shown that the main contribution to the thrust deduction fraction is the resistance increment fraction whose variation can be explained by analyzing the resistance components for the low intermediate and high speed ranges the resistance increment due to the global flow i e sinkage and trim variations and local flow waterjet induced flow were computed independently interestingly this study showed that the global and local effects independently influence the total resistance increment in the low speed range large positive thrust deduction fraction values are computed this is due to the increase in the hydrodynamic pressure resistance of the transom larger suction as well as the increase in the hydrostatic pressure resistance of the hull the former is caused by the jet entrainment which reduces the hydrodynamic pressure at the transom and the latter is due to the increase transom submergence the transoms of the bare hull and the self propelled hull clear the water near the hump speed the latter clears at a lower froude number mainly due to the jet entrainment there is a peak in the resistance coefficient curve at the critical froude number the resistance difference between the hulls is the largest at the peak where the waterjet driven hull transom becomes dry then the difference diminishes rapidly with speed until the bare hull transom clears the water this causes the rapid drop of the thrust deduction fraction observed near the hump speed in the intermediate speed range the resistance increment fraction is almost constant and has values around zero the hull has rather large trim angles in this speed range 4 bow up so the hydrostatic pressure force acting on the intake opening will have a horizontal component backwards this surface is not present in self propulsion and therefore the hydrostatic pressure resistance is reduced there is however an increase in the hydrodynamic pressure resistance of the hull caused by the increased displacement sinkage the net result is a resistance increment close to zero in the high speed range the resistance increment fraction gradually increases like in the intermediate speed range there is a decrease in the hydrostatic pressure resistance due to the missing intake opening surface and an increase in the hydrodynamic resistance due to increased sinkage however the latter effect gradually becomes more important which causes the increase in the total resistance finally it should be emphasized that the negative thrust deduction fraction in the intermediate speed range is not due to reduced hull resistance in fact the waterjet propelled hull resistance remains rather unaffected compared to the bare hull resistance the major reason for negative thrust deduction is the jet system thrust deduction fraction t j acknowledgment

23573,the definition of thrust deduction in waterjet propulsion is different from that of a propeller driven hull and cannot be interpreted in the same way a particularly interesting feature of the waterjet thrust deduction is the large variation with froude number this is well known from experience but has never been fully explained the objective of this paper is to use cfd to address the reasons for these large variations to this end the thrust deduction fraction is split into resistance increment fraction and jet thrust deduction fraction the former is due to the self propelled hull resistance change in comparison with the bare hull resistance and the latter is due to the difference between gross and net thrust this split reveals that the main reason for the thrust deduction variation is the hull resistance change analysis of the resistance increment in different speed ranges is performed by studying the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic pressure changes on the hull as well as the friction change due to the waterjet system despite the negative thrust deduction fraction in the intermediate speed range there is no indication of a resistance reduction compared to that of the

waterjet propulsion concept is based on increasing the flow head through a pump inside a ducting channel and then discharging the ingested flow with a higher momentum flux behind the most common waterjet intake design is flush to the hull bottom however depending on the craft type the intake geometry can be ram or scoop shaped kruppa et al 1968 depending on the specific speed of the waterjet pump a mixed flow or an axial flow pump can be employed in the unit white 2008 within the speed range of 30 60 knots the major waterjet manufacturers suggest this propulsion method over conventional propellers since the waterjet unit is embedded in the hull the interaction effects between the waterjet system and the hull are quite different from those of conventional propellers in contrast with the propeller hull interaction effects which are rather well defined there are still unanswered questions regarding the waterjet hull interaction three major research studies in this field are the doctoral thesis by coop 1995 van terwisga 1996 and bulten 2006 coop investigated the interaction between waterjet and hull using model scale and full scale measurements as well as empirical and analytical methods he discusses the possible mechanisms contributing to the overall interaction effect and lists the waterjet momentum forces causing lift and moment about the centre of gravity the wake momentum losses and the loss of the planing surface at the intake opening as the most significant ones coop reports the largest measured negative thrust deduction fractions up to 8 around the hump speed he states that the ittc suggested method for towing the hull along the shaft line is the most conservative approach which yields the highest bare hull resistance in his doctoral thesis van terwisga 1996 showed that the thrust deduction fraction of a waterjet propelled hull varies considerably with speed and may even obtain negative values in an intermediate speed range through a set of analytical numerical and experimental studies he found a difference between gross thrust and net thrust 1 1 definition of gross thrust and net thrust are given in section 2 especially around ship speeds where the transom is not fully cleared he states that the difference is practically zero for higher speeds and therefore the difference between gross thrust and bare hull resistance is a good measure of the resistance increment of the hull due to the waterjet induced flow through an uncertainty analysis of propulsion tests he shows that the error made in the flow rate measurement in power estimation increases with decreasing jet velocity to ship velocity ratio he divides the effects causing the resistance change of a self propelled hull into a global sinkage trim effect and a local effect on the flow around the intake due to the ingested flow then he states that if the assumption of independence between the changes due to the local and the global flow is true the change in resistance may be estimated from a taylor series in the global and local flow parameters keeping only linear terms based on the measurements of a powerboat propelled by a single waterjet unit he concludes that the trim angle is the most important parameter for analyzing the resistance increment of the hull bulten 2006 studied the flow inside waterjet propulsion systems employing computational fluid dynamics cfd tools the integration of axial force component on the waterjet unit as well as a simplified version of the integral momentum balance equation were applied to calculate the waterjet thrust bulten reports a clear deviation between the results of these methods for higher ship speeds he also computed a large vertical force in the same speed range according to these findings bulten concludes that the method based on the momentum balance for the waterjet control volume is incorrect possibly because of the influence of the hull in the vicinity of the waterjet inlet and partly because of neglecting the contributions of the pressure distribution acting on the streamtube 2 2 see fig 1 and read the corresponding text for the definition of the streamtube the ittc high speed marine vehicle committee ittc 17 1987 and the ittc specialist committee on waterjets ittc 21 1996 ittc 22 1998 ittc 23 2002 ittc 24 2005 have proposed a test procedure for investigation of waterjet hull interaction which was modified during the years a measurement campaign was also conducted by the ittc specialist committee on waterjets on a semi displacement hull with two sets of axial flow waterjets the results of this study which was performed by many different institutes show a large scatter for the thrust deduction fraction this highlights the importance of the waterjet flow rate measurement the office of naval research rispin 2007 carried out a comprehensive set of measurements on a demi hull with a pair of waterjet units the difference of boundary layer thickness due to scale change was taken into account in the data scaling procedure consequently although the thrust deduction fraction in the intermediate speed range was positive at model scale taking this correction into account resulted in a negative thrust deduction fraction this conclusion raises the question of whether or not the thrust deduction is dependent on scaling kamal et al 2015 carried out an experimental comparative study of the powering of waterjet and screw propeller for a medium speed wave piercing catamaran they predict the thrust deduction fraction to be very low for the waterjet propelled hull 0 1 to 0 35 but no certain reason for the small values is provided several studies employing reynolds averaged navier stokes rans methods have been carried out modeling waterjet propelled hulls and including power estimation e g kandasamy et al 2010 2011 takai et al 2011 however the detailed waterjet hull interaction effects have not been the focus of these studies eslamdoost et al 2013 presented a method based on potential flow theory for studying the waterjet driven hull flow they also identified the parameters which contribute to the waterjet hull interaction in eslamdoost et al 2014 in their third consequent paper eslamdoost et al 2016 these authors investigated the difference between the net thrust and gross thrust of a waterjet unit through a rans study they show that the net thrust and the gross thrusts are not the same and deviate from each other especially in the speed range where the nozzle is submerged in the transom wave thus many researchers have contributed to the understanding of the waterjet hull interaction effects but yet there is a knowledge gap in explanation of the reasons for the large variation of the thrust deduction fraction with speed as well as of the negative thrust deduction values sometimes reported in the intermediate speed range the goal of the present paper is to study the thrust deduction fraction of a waterjet propelled hull in a wide speed range and to clarify the reasons for the large variation of this fraction in the following first the definitions required for the analysis of the waterjet system are introduced in section 2 then the hull geometry and the towing tank measured sinkage and trim are presented in section 3 and section 4 respectively a brief review of the computational technique for the waterjet flow simulation is given in section 5 and in section 6 the components which contribute to the thrust deduction fraction in different speed ranges are discussed in detail finally several conclusions are drawn 2 theory the thrust deduction fraction is the relation between the bare hull resistance and the thrust required to propel a vessel for a conventional propeller the net thrust is employed to define the thrust deduction fraction as follows 1 t p 1 r b h r a t n e t where r b h and t n e t are the bare hull resistance and the net thrust of the propeller s since the frictional resistance of the hull at model scale due to lower reynolds number is larger than the full scale frictional resistance a towing force is applied to the hull during the self propulsion test this force is called the rope force and is shown with r a in contrast to a propeller for which the net thrust is transmitted to the hull through its shaft line the net thrust of a waterjet unit is transmitted to the hull through the shaft line and the ducting channel the integrated geometry of the waterjet unit and hull makes it tricky to measure the net thrust directly in order to skip the impracticality of measuring the net thrust the ittc high speed vehicle committee ittc 17 1987 suggested to use gross thrust t g which is the momentum flux change through the waterjet control volume defined in fig 1 in the control volume shown in this figure surface 2 is part of the waterjet inflow streamtube no flow passes through this surface the capture area surface 1 is the cross section of the streamtube located far enough in front of the intake ramp tangency point before inlet losses occur ittc 21 1996 and as a practical solution the ittc specialist committee on the validation of waterjet test procedures recommends this section to be placed one inlet length forward of the ramp tangency point ittc 24 2005 the internal material boundaries of the waterjet system that extends to surface 1 and surface 2 is denoted with surface 6 surface 7 is the boundary area of the pump control volume and surface 8 represents the nozzle exit area the cross section of the jet where the mean static pressure equals the atmospheric pressure is called vena contracta and is indicated with surface 9 the vena contracta has the minimum jet cross sectional area the only surface shown in fig 1 that belongs neither to the waterjet control volume nor the hull is surface 4 this surface is enclosed by the stagnation line on the intake lip cut water and the line where the channel merges with the flat bottom surfaces 1 2 and 4 are flow dependent and can vary one operation condition to another the actual shapes of these surfaces are shown in fig 2 the horizontal component of the gross thrust vector can be obtained by writing the horizontal momentum flux balance over the control volume shown in fig 1 2 t g a 1 a 8 ρ u x u k n k d a where ρ is the density of the fluid u is the velocity vector and n is the unit vector normal to the control surface pointing outward of the control volume the einstein notation is used in equation 2 where index k ranges over 1 2 and 3 the total thrust deduction fraction of a waterjet propelled craft then can be based on the gross thrust as follows 3 t 1 r b h r a t g a collection of thrust deduction fraction data for different hulls has been obtained through self propulsion tests at marin for a wide variety of hulls with length to beam ratio varying from 3 to 15 see fig 9 the overall trend of this collection shows that t has large positive values in the low speed range small negative values in the intermediate speed range and then approaches small positive values in the higher speed range in this paper we will study the reasons for the variation of the thrust deduction fraction in different speed ranges to be able to proceed with this investigation some more definitions are explained in the following part considering the material boundaries of the waterjet system the net thrust t n e t is defined as the force vector acting upon the material boundaries of the waterjet system directly passing the force through to the hull van terwisga 1996 like the gross thrust in this paper the horizontal component of the net thrust vector will be called net thrust t n e t and is defined as 4 t n e t a 4 a 6 σ x d a v 7 ρ f p x d v where σ x is the x component of the surface stresses pressure and shear stresses and f p x is the x component of the pump force per unit mass as mentioned earlier it is a tricky task to measure the net thrust of a waterjet unit but with the aid of cfd it is possible to obtain the terms shown in equation 4 then the hull resistance increment fraction based on the net thrust of the waterjet unit would be as follows 5 t r 1 r b h r a t n e t according to the definitions presented in equation 3 and equation 5 the difference between the total thrust deduction fraction and the resistance increment fraction is the jet system thrust deduction fraction t j plus a second order term including t r and t j eslamdoost 2014 6 t t r t j t r t j where 7 t j 1 t n e t t g the jet system thrust deduction fraction represents the difference between gross thrust and net thrust a negative t j implies that net thrust is larger than gross thrust and vice versa the objective of the current paper is to explain the physics of the waterjet hull interaction in order to achieve this goal a reynolds averaged navier stokes rans solver is employed to compute the components of the thrust deduction fraction for a high speed hull the relative importance of t r and t j is studied and conclusions are drawn on the reasons for the variation of the thrust deduction fraction from displacement speeds to planing speeds including the intermediate speed range where the thrust deduction fraction is negative 3 hull and waterjet geometry the hull geometry used in this study is a test case designed at sspa the hull was 2 3 m long and for the self propulsion test it was equipped with a mixed flow waterjet pump and an intake designed by rolls royce the hull geometry and the positioning of the waterjet unit on the hull are shown in fig 3 note that the unit was mounted on the hull also in the resistance tests but then the intake opening was covered and the unit was filled with water to create the same initial conditions for the bare hull and self propelled one brown 2013 4 measurements resistance and self propulsion tests were carried out at sspa to provide data for validation of the numerical method and to determine the sinkage and trim under all conditions to increase the accuracy of the numerical computations the measured sinkage and trim was employed in the computations of the present paper the measured aft and fore draft of the bare hull bh and self propelled hull sp are plotted in fig 4 comparing the aft draft of the self propelled hull with that of the bare hull it is seen that the transom submergence of the waterjet driven hull is larger than the bare hull transom submergence for the entire measured speed range the sinkage and trim values of bh and sp can be calculated using the fore and aft drafts fig 5 shows the sinkage of the hulls at mid ship the waterjet propelled hull sinks deeper due to the action of the waterjet unit eslamdoost et al 2013 the measured trim angle of the bare hull and self propelled hull is plotted in fig 6 at the intermediate and higher speed ranges fn 0 6 there is a bow down trimming moment which causes the self propelled hull to trim less than the bare hull since the aft part of the waterjet driven hull submerges deeper at the lower speed ranges the trim angle of the self propelled hull becomes larger than that of the bare hull 5 computational method the numerical simulations presented in this paper are carried out employing the code star ccm 8 02 that uses a finite volume method to solve the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations and the continuity equation in integral form the realizable k ε turbulence model with wall function is used to solve the turbulence effect on the mean flow the tracing of the free surface is done using the volume of fluid method vof in combination with the high resolution interface capturing hric scheme to discretise the convective term of the volume fraction transport equation muzaferija and perić 1999 this scheme is suitable for tracking sharp interphase of an immiscible phase mixture and resolves the free surface within typically one cell since the flow features inside the waterjet pump is not the focus of this study a body force model is employed instead of modeling the actual geometry of the waterjet pump to reduce the computation costs thus the impeller blades and the stator guide vanes are removed in this approach as far as the body force induced head rise through the pump is equal to that of the actual pump the average flow would be the same as if the actual pump geometry was simulated the body force magnitude is equal to the resistance of the entire system including the hull and the ducting channel minus the rope force applied to the hull during the self propulsion tests for unloading the water jet in the computations the body force is inserted as an axial source term into the momentum equation and is distributed uniformly inside the volume which surrounds the impeller a thinner or thicker region can be used for distribution of the body force but it should be kept in mind that the volumetric integral of the body force inside this region should balance the other forces acting on the entire system in order to achieve a more stable numerical convergence the thickness of this region should be such that the flow accelerates gradually instead of an abrupt acceleration that may happen with the use of a very thin region in order to eliminate the uncertainties of sinkage and trim measured values have been used in the computations it is assumed that the flow around the hull is symmetric and therefore just the half the hull model is used in the simulations the computational domain is extended 1 5 lpp in front of the hull and 4 5 lpp behind it the lower boundary of the domain is 2 5 lpp below the undisturbed free surface and the upper 1 5 lpp above the undisturbed free surface level the width of the computational domain is 2 5 lpp inlet velocity boundary conditions are used for all far field boundaries except the downstream boundary where pressure outlet is applied a systematic variation of the domain size showed that the pressure and frictional resistance components varied less than 1 when the domain size was enlarged by a factor of 3 this ensures the results are not depending on the domain size the mesh used for the simulations consists of unstructured surface mesh prism layers and core mesh prism layers are employed to resolve the boundary layer and hexahedral cells outside the boundary layer grid form the core mesh the hexahedral cells are aligned with the direction of the undisturbed flow see fig 7 the surface mesh and the symmetry plane mesh in the aft part of the hull are shown in fig 8 anisotropic mesh refinement in three different levels are used close to the undisturbed free surface and a finer mesh is employed around the waterjet intake as well as around the discharged jet to capture the details of the flow in these regions the mesh size and mesh distribution around the hull are kept almost the same between the waterjet propelled hull and the bare hull for the consistency of the simulations a systematic grid refinement study was carried out for the bare hull and self propelled hull grids to obtain a suitable cell size and hence total grid number see eslamdoost et al 2015 and eslamdoost et al 2016 respectively the formal verification of the resistance and thrust coefficients is presented in these two papers the total number of cells for the bare hull and the self propelled hull were 3 7 e 6 and 5 7 e 6 respectively based on the least squares root method by eça and hoekstra 2014 a numerical uncertainty of 2 3 was computed for both grids the bare hull resistance the self propulsion volumetric flow rate and the gross thrust are validated against the measured values in eslamdoost et al 2016 the average discrepancy between the computed and the measured bare hull resistance in the froude number range of 0 2 1 6 is less than 4 the computed flow rate and the gross thrust are under predicted by less than 3 and 8 in comparison to the measured values respectively 6 analysis of the thrust deduction in order to compute the thrust deduction fraction as shown in equation 3 it is required to compute the bare hull resistance and the gross thrust for which the momentum flux through the capture area and nozzle exit are needed the procedure for computing the capture area geometry is explained in eslamdoost et al 2016 where the computed bare hull resistance and the gross thrust for the froude number range between 0 2 and 1 4 and are also presented based on these computed values the thrust deduction fraction is plotted in fig 9 along with collected thrust deduction fractions shown in fig 2 the trend seen in the computed t is practically the same as in the collected values the resistance increment fraction t r can be obtained from equation 5 in fig 10 the t and t r curves are plotted together there is an almost constant shift between t and t r at all froude numbers but the smallest one the reasons why the shift is larger here is explained in eslamdoost et al 2016 all features of the t variation with speed the high values at low speed the rapid drop near the froude number where the transom clears the low values in the intermediate speed range and the increase at higher speeds are caused by the variation of t r it is the variation of the self propelled hull resistance that causes the variation of the thrust deduction fraction therefore the following discussion will focus on t r 6 1 resistance increment the components of the resistance are obtained by splitting the total resistance into the resistance of the transom and the resistance of the rest of the hull which in the following discussion is mentioned as hull the waterjet unit is excluded from the self propelled hull but the intake and exit openings are on the hull and the transom the resistance of the hull and the transom individually are split into the pressure resistance and the frictional resistance where the pressure resistance in turn is split into the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic resistance this split is shown in a flowchart form in fig 11 assuming that sinkage trim and the local flow changes independently influence the resistance change the resistance increment of the hull may be estimated from a linear expansion in a taylor series and expressed as follows van terwisga 1996 8 δ r q σ τ r σ q 0 σ 0 τ 0 d σ r τ q 0 σ 0 τ 0 d τ r q q 0 σ 0 τ 0 d q where r is the hull resistance and q σ and τ are the flow rate through the ducting channel the hull sinkage and the hull trim angle respectively index 0 denotes the bare hull the bare hull equilibrium position is the reference point about which the taylor expansion is made obtaining the partial derivatives of resistance with respect to sinkage trim and flow rate individually the contribution of each of them to the resistance increment may be estimated the combined effect of sinkage and trim can be called global flow pattern change and the contribution of the flow change around the intake can be referred to as local flow change the effect of the global flow change on the resistance can be obtained by introducing a bare hull which has the same sinkage and trim as the waterjet propelled hull also the comparison of the resistance between this new hull with the self propelled hull enables to identify the explicit effect of the waterjet induced flow local effects on the hull resistance increment in the following the notation bh and sp are used for identification of bare hull and self propelled hull respectively and the notation bhsp is used for bare hull with the same sinkage and trim as the self propelled hull the way that the global and local effects are obtained is schematically shown in fig 12 for the following discussion three froude numbers have been selected each one representing an interesting speed range in fig 10 the froude numbers are 0 2 0 8 and 1 4 based on the resistance components presented in fig 11 and the global and local flows resistance increments defined in fig 12 results for the three selected froude numbers are discussed in the following sections 6 1 1 lower speed range 0 20 fn 0 47 the resistance increment fraction curve can be divided into two distinct regions in the low speed range as shown in fig 10 in the speed range between froude number 0 2 and 0 43 the t r curve slope is negative but is not as steep as the part of the curve between froude numbers 0 43 and 0 47 in fact these froude numbers are the transom clearance froude numbers for the self propelled hull and the bare hull respectively this indicates that the resistance increment is directly associated with the critical froude numbers of the hulls where the transom becomes dry the resistance increment in these two regions and the influence of the transom clearance on t r are discussed in the following 6 1 1 1 0 20 fn 0 43 the resistance increment fraction has large positive values in this speed range and decreases with froude number at an almost constant rate until the transom of the waterjet driven hull clears water at froude number 0 43 fig 13 shows the hull and the transom resistance increment components at froude number 0 2 due to the global local and total effects in a schematic form the flags in this figure represent the resistance increment in newtons due to each resistance component separately a backward pointing flag indicates an increased resistance component and vice versa in the following the reasons behind the magnitude and sign of each component are discussed global effects starting with the study of the global effects it is seen that the hydrostatic resistance of the transom decreases 1 0 n while it increases on the hull 1 1 n the different signs of the hydrostatic resistance increment on the transom and the hull are due to the normal vectors of these surfaces which have their axial components in opposite directions the main reason for the hydrostatic resistance change at this speed is the deeper sinkage of bhsp compared to bh 1 5 m m at mid ship see fig 5 which increases the projected area of the hull and transom below the undisturbed free surface since the hull does not trim at this speed the increase in the projected area of the transom and hull should be the same however it is seen that the hydrostatic resistance reduction due to the pressure on the transom is smaller than the increase on the hull this is caused by the lower water level at the transom for bhsp the slightly deeper transom edge causes a reduction in hydrodynamic pressure when the flow passes across the edge this reduces the hydrodynamic pressure in the whole massively separated flow behind the transom causing the water level to drop hence a smaller area for the hydrostatic pressure to act on since there is a minor increase in the transom submergence of bhsp the hydrodynamic pressure resistance of the transom slightly increases 0 1 n due to the lower hydrodynamic pressure acting on the transom despite the deeper sinkage of bhsp the hydrodynamic resistance of the hull does not change at this speed the hull sinks by 1 5 m m at mid ship and the corresponding displacement change is 2 as a rough estimate the resistance may be assumed proportional to the displacement therefore there would be 2 increase in the hydrodynamic resistance of the hull at this speed but since the hydrodynamic resistance of the hull is so small from the beginning 0 6 n the anticipated 2 increase is negligible the frictional resistance of the transom is zero since the transom is practically at right angles to the x axis the change between the wetted surface areas of bhsp and bh is very small and therefore the frictional resistance increment of the hull due to the global effects is also zero local effects to study the local flow effects the sp and of bhsp resistance components are compared since these hulls have same sinkage trim the only cause which can change the hydrostatic force component on the transom can be the waterjet system an important effect that influences the pressure distribution on the transom as well as the pressure in the vicinity of the transom edge is the jet entrainment therefore before starting the analysis of the resistance changes due to local effects the physics of the jet entrainment and its influence on the hydrodynamic and hydrostatic pressures are discussed the hydrodynamic pressure coefficient on bhsp and sp as well as the streamlines behind the transoms of these hulls are shown in figs 14 and 15 respectively as seen in fig 15 the discharged jet entrains the dead water behind the transom therefore the flow at the transom edge bends towards the transom hollow faster to replace the entrained water the faster turn of the flow means that the curvature of the streamlines leaving the transom edge is larger compared to the curvature of the bare hull streamlines the larger curvature of the streamlines means that the hydrodynamic pressure is lower at the transom edge on the average c p is about 0 03 lower for sp at the transom edge see eslamdoost 2014 and thereby also on the entire submerged transom this leads to a lower water level at the transom and thereby to a smaller hydrostatic pressure force having explained the effect of jet entrainment on the hydrodynamic and hydrostatic pressure distributions on the transom we will now proceed with the discussion of the resistance increments due to the local effects the reduction of the hydrostatic pressure force on the transom due to jet entrainment causes a slight increase in hydrostatic resistance 0 3 n a larger contributor is the missing area of the nozzle exit which contributes 0 8 n out of the total increase of 1 1 n see fig 13 the hydrostatic resistance of the hull due to the local effects also increases by 0 5 n mostly caused by the missing surface covering the intake opening since this surface is facing backwards at this low froude number removing the surface will cause an increased hydrostatic resistance as explained above the jet causes a decreased hydrodynamic pressure on the transom which yields an increase in resistance by 1 1 n the hydrodynamic pressure resistance of the hull also increases as a result of the local effects 0 2 n the reason is not the missing surface at the intake opening which has a negligible contribution to this effect rather it is the induced flow over the hull caused by the intake suction that gives this small resistance increase the frictional resistance increment of the transom due to local effects is zero since the transom is practically at right angles to the x axis this resistance component on the hull decreases 0 1 n due to the missing area of the intake opening all effects a direct comparison of sp and bh resistance components is also made in fig 13 interestingly the sum of the resistance components due to the global and the local effects are equal to the components obtained directly by comparing the resistance change between bh and sp this finding supports the hypothesis that the resistance increment of the hull is a linear function of sinkage trim and flow rate equation 7 the sum of all the resistance components at this speed becomes rather large compared to the bare hull resistance 5 1 n this is the reason for the large positive t and t r in the lower speed range the total resistance of the self propelled hull compared to the bare hull increases by 58 8 of which the local effects contribute 54 9 only 3 9 is due to global effects the resistance increment fraction t r is very large 0 37 of which 0 34 is due to local effects 6 1 1 2 0 43 fn 0 47 in the speed range to be discussed in this section t r drops abruptly from large positive values to values close to zero in this study it is discovered that the sudden change occurs in the speed range between the critical froude number for transom clearance of the self propelled hull and that of the bare hull in the following first the possible causes that may result in the earlier transom clearance of the waterjet driven hull are discussed and afterwards the reasons for the sharp drop of the t r value are explained both measurements and computations show that the critical froude number where the transom becomes dry differs between the towed hull and the waterjet propelled one table 1 shows the measured and computed critical froude numbers for both hulls note that the ranges shown for the measurements and computations are given by the step in froude number the step was smaller in the experiments hence a smaller range although the computed wetted surface area of the hull is very similar to the towing tank result the critical froude number is under predicted in the computations compared to the measured ones which can also be seen from the computed bare hull free surface in comparison to the towing tank results fig 16 according to both the measurements and computations the transom of the waterjet driven hull clears earlier than the bare hull as seen in fig 16 while the bare hull transom is still wet foamy region behind the transom the waterjet propelled hull has cleared water glassy surface behind the transom the evolution of the computed transom wetted surface area for the bare hull and the waterjet propelled hull is plotted in fig 17 there are several reasons why the self propelled hull has an earlier transom clearance than the bare hull but it cannot be due to transom draft changes since sp has a larger transom draft than bh deeper transom submergence causes a later transom clearance in order to show that the earlier clearance of sp is caused by local effects a set of simulations was carried out for sp and bhsp the results from this set of simulations are presented in the following fig 18 shows the contour plot of sp and bhsp wave height at f n 0 434 the wave patterns of these two cases are very different behind the transom the aft part streamlines on the symmetry plane can be compared in fig 19 despite the equal sinkage and trim for both cases the bare hull transom is wet and transom of the self propelled hull is dry a recirculating zone is noted behind the transom of the bare hull whereas no such recirculating zone can be observed in the self propelled case we believe this to be an effect of the high momentum jet flow which pushes the dead water flow behind the transom downstream and eliminates the breaking waves filling the hollow behind the transom at froude numbers just below the critical one the second reason for the delay in transom clearance of sp is the boundary layer development behind the waterjet intake low momentum boundary layer flow is sucked into the waterjet unit and then expelled out far beyond the transom the boundary layer developing on the bottom behind the intake is thus thinner than for the bare hull fig 20 shows the axial velocity at the transom edge on three vertical lines positioned in different transverse distances from the hull symmetry plane for both the bare hull and the waterjet driven hull the axial velocity at the transom edge is larger for sp compared to bhsp the largest difference between these hulls is seen at the transom centreline this means that the flow leaving the waterjet propelled hull transom edge has a higher momentum and therefore the stern wave is less prone to breaking a third effect may be envisaged considering fig 21 which compares the wave cut at y l p p 0 243 for bhsp and sp at the same froude number due to the suction of the waterjet unit the wave height is lowered on the sides of the hull in the aft part starting near the capture area section x l p p 0 71 and therefore part of the flow which could fill in the hollow behind the transom from the sides is removed these three effects result in an earlier transom clearance of the waterjet driven hull in comparison to the bare hull the effect of the different critical froude numbers on the resistance increment is discussed in the following section during the resistance tests of the hull used in this study it was discovered that there is an abrupt peak in the resistance coefficient of the bare hull at the critical froude number the reasons for the peak were investigated using cfd and presented in eslamdoost et al 2015 further studies of the self propelled hull revealed the existence of the same peak in the resistance coefficient of the waterjet driven hull as appears in fig 22 since the self propelled hull has a lower critical froude number the peak is shifted to the left it is this shift that causes the rapid drop in t r replacing resistance by c t in equation 5 yields t r 1 c t b h c t s p employing this equation in combination with the data given in fig 22 it is it is seen that t r is large and positive at the critical froude number of the self propelled hull thereafter dropping to zero at the froude number where the two curves meet this explains the abrupt drop in the resistance increment fraction curve of fig 10 6 1 2 intermediate speed range 0 47 fn 1 00 as seen in fig 10 the resistance increment fraction is close to zero in the intermediate speed range 0 47 f n 1 00 the speed in this range is beyond the critical froude numbers of the bare hull and self propelled hulls and therefore there is no hydrostatic or hydrodynamic force acting on the transom it is the change of forces acting on the hull that contribute to the resistance increment see fig 23 global effects the global contribution to the hydrostatic pressure resistance increment of the hull is 2 2 n the deeper sinkage of bhsp compared to bh 6 m m at mid ship see fig 5 increases the hydrostatic pressure acting on the hull but despite such an increase the smaller trim angle of bhsp 0 2 less positions the hull such that the imbalance between the hydrostatic pressure force acting on the fore and aft parts of the hull diminished this is the reason for the reduced hydrostatic pressure resistance due to the global effects the hydrodynamic pressure resistance increment due to the global effects is 7 8 n the reason is the deeper sinkage which gives an increased displacement and thereby a higher hydrodynamic pressure on the bottom comparing bhsp and bh it is seen that the increased sinkage and decreased trim angle result in increased wetted surface area of the hull and therefore the frictional resistance of bhsp increases 0 6 n local effects the local effects cause a reduction in the hydrostatic pressure resistance of the hull 5 1 n the missing intake opening area is the major part of this reduction 4 9 n the trim angle of the hull at froude number 0 8 is about 3 8 see fig 6 this positions the intake opening surface such that the hydrostatic force acting on this surface has an axial component pointing backward the hydrostatic pressure resistance of sp decreases by removal of this surface the rest of the hydrostatic pressure resistance increment due to the local effect 0 2 n is caused by the intake induced flow which alters the waves close to the aft part of the hull the local effects contribution to the hydrodynamic pressure resistance increment influences the resistance by 1 1 n because of the missing intake surface subtracting the hydrodynamic pressure resistance of sp and bhsp and integrating the hydrodynamic pressure on the area of the intake opening of bhsp results in the same number this can be considered as a confirmation that the intake opening is the only important factor which influences the hydrodynamic pressure resistance of the hull the missing surface of the intake opening decreases the frictional resistance of sp 1 2 n total effects like in the lower speed range in the intermediate speed range the sum of the resistance increment components due to the global and local effects are equal to the directly computed resistance increment components at this operating froude number the hull hydrostatic hydrodynamic and frictional resistances vary such that the sum of all these variations becomes almost zero and that is the reason for obtaining near zero resistance increment fraction in the intermediate operating speed range 6 1 3 high speed range 1 0 fn 1 4 the resistance increment fraction gradually increases and has positive values in this speed range fig 10 the bh sp and bhsp resistance increment components at f n 1 4 are given in fig 24 each of these resistance increment components is discussed in the following subsections global effects the sinkage of bhsp is larger compared to bh 11 m m deeper at mid ship see fig 5 and due to the bow down trimming moment of the waterjet the hull trims less 0 2 see fig 6 the combination of these two effects results in an increased hydrostatic pressure on the hull due to the trim angle of bhsp at this speed 3 9 the x component of the surface normal points forwards and therefore the resultant force caused by the increased hydrostatic pressure on the hull will point backwards resulting in a slight increase of the hull hydrostatic pressure resistance 0 8 n as stated in the previous paragraph bhsp sinkage is larger compared to bh which increases the displacement the increased hydrodynamic pressure resistance due to the global effects 14 9 n is a result of the increased displacement the wetted surface area of the bhsp increases by almost 5 9 because of the changed sinkage and trim of the hull this results in 2 3 n increase in the frictional resistance of the hull local effects removing the contribution of the hydrostatic pressure force acting on the intake opening will decrease the resistance this is the reason for the negative hydrostatic pressure resistance increment at this speed 5 0 n like in the previous speed range the surface normal of the intake opening at f n 1 4 is pointing forward since the hydrodynamic pressure is negative in the vicinity of the opening the removal of a surface from this region results in an increased hydrodynamic pressure resistance but only a trivial proportion of the total reduction of the hydrodynamic pressure resistance by the local effects is caused due to the missing intake opening area 0 1 n out of 2 0 n this means that the local effects alter the hydrodynamic pressure resistance of the hull mainly through the intake induced flow which changes the waves around the hull the altered pressure distribution around the intake opening on sp is noticeable comparing to bhsp the missing intake opening surface causes a decrease in the wetted surface area of the hull by 6 3 resulting in 4 3 n decrease in the frictional resistance of the hull total effects the total resistance increment is obtained by comparing the resistances of sp and bh as seen in fig 24 like for the other speed ranges the total resistance increment is equal to the increment which is obtained through the superposition of the global and local effects the sum of all resistance increment components vary such that the total resistance increases in the higher speed range among all the components the hydrodynamic pressure resistance of the hull is the dominating one 6 2 difference between t and t r so far the causes of thrust deduction fraction variations in different speed ranges have been discussed through analyzing the resistance increment fraction which dictates the trend of the t curve fig 10 the gap between the t and t r curves is caused by the difference between the waterjet net thrust and gross thrust and as shown in equation 6 is equal to t j t r t j the difference between the waterjet net thrust and gross thrust is discussed in eslamdoost et al 2016 where the difference is divided into two main components intake drag d i and exit drag d e intake drag is the x component of the force acting on the capture area and the stream tube and exit drag is the x component of the force acting on the nozzle exit see fig 2 the jet thrust deduction fraction t j is obtained from the difference between the gross and net thrust divided by the gross thrust implicit formula 9 t j t g t n e t t g it can also be obtained from the sum of the intake and exit drag explicit formula 10 t j d i d e t g the jet thrust deduction fraction using both the implicit and explicit formulas is shown in fig 25 despite the fact that the implicit t j is obtained from subtraction of two large numbers and the explicit one is obtained from summation of two small numbers both approaches predict almost the same value except in the low speed range where the nozzle exit is not ventilated t j is small the resistance increment fraction is also small in this speed range fig 10 and therefore the second order term in equation 6 becomes negligible as assumed by the ittc waterjet specialist committee ittc 24 2005 however this is not a valid assumption if the waterjet is operating in the low speed range where the second order term becomes as important as the other terms in equation 6 we have all the components on the right hand side of equation 6 and therefore the total thrust deduction fraction obtained through this equation can be compared with t computed directly from its definition equation 3 the results of these two approaches as well as the case which the second order term neglected are shown in fig 26 the thrust deduction fraction computed from these different approaches are in a good agreement with each other this verifies the approach that we have used for decomposing the components of thrust deduction fraction also the importance of taking the second order term in equation 6 into account in the low speed range is clearly seen in this figure disregarding this term will result in under prediction of t at lower speeds 7 conclusions the motivation of this work was to understand the reasons behind the varying thrust deduction fraction at different speed ranges thus the thrust deduction was investigated in detail over a large froude number range it was shown that the main contribution to the thrust deduction fraction is the resistance increment fraction whose variation can be explained by analyzing the resistance components for the low intermediate and high speed ranges the resistance increment due to the global flow i e sinkage and trim variations and local flow waterjet induced flow were computed independently interestingly this study showed that the global and local effects independently influence the total resistance increment in the low speed range large positive thrust deduction fraction values are computed this is due to the increase in the hydrodynamic pressure resistance of the transom larger suction as well as the increase in the hydrostatic pressure resistance of the hull the former is caused by the jet entrainment which reduces the hydrodynamic pressure at the transom and the latter is due to the increase transom submergence the transoms of the bare hull and the self propelled hull clear the water near the hump speed the latter clears at a lower froude number mainly due to the jet entrainment there is a peak in the resistance coefficient curve at the critical froude number the resistance difference between the hulls is the largest at the peak where the waterjet driven hull transom becomes dry then the difference diminishes rapidly with speed until the bare hull transom clears the water this causes the rapid drop of the thrust deduction fraction observed near the hump speed in the intermediate speed range the resistance increment fraction is almost constant and has values around zero the hull has rather large trim angles in this speed range 4 bow up so the hydrostatic pressure force acting on the intake opening will have a horizontal component backwards this surface is not present in self propulsion and therefore the hydrostatic pressure resistance is reduced there is however an increase in the hydrodynamic pressure resistance of the hull caused by the increased displacement sinkage the net result is a resistance increment close to zero in the high speed range the resistance increment fraction gradually increases like in the intermediate speed range there is a decrease in the hydrostatic pressure resistance due to the missing intake opening surface and an increase in the hydrodynamic resistance due to increased sinkage however the latter effect gradually becomes more important which causes the increase in the total resistance finally it should be emphasized that the negative thrust deduction fraction in the intermediate speed range is not due to reduced hull resistance in fact the waterjet propelled hull resistance remains rather unaffected compared to the bare hull resistance the major reason for negative thrust deduction is the jet system thrust deduction fraction t j acknowledgment

23574,the needs to reduce the frictional component of the resistance of a ship leads researchers to find new solutions the air cavity solution seems to be one of the most promising one usually it is very difficult with the experimental tests to understand the air distribution under the hull and the streamlines during the injection of air the principal objective of this paper is evaluating the potentiality of the cfd approach in the study of air cavity ships acs for a planing yacht the first part of paper describes the cfd evaluation of the resistance curves without air injection the second part deals with the injection of the air under the hull in this case the boundary conditions are the results of the first campaign of simulations a comparison between the experimental and cfd results is shown an assessment of the streamlines and air distribution is proposed and an evaluation of the wetted and ventilated areas is conducted in order to understand the relation between the flow rate the velocity of the hull and the air distribution the results can be used for modifying the hull geometry in order to better accommodate the air layer keywords computational fluid dynamics air cavity ship hull design ship resistance computer aided engineering 1 introduction a common theme in design and research in the last years is the green thinking oriented to reduce the environmental impact of products every manufacture has an environmental impact in each phase of its life and in order to obtain the better results the engineers have to find new solutions for reducing them a great deal of work was done in the naval engineering for reducing in each part the environmental impact of a ship life the principal polluting causes can be divided in three different phases manufacturing use phase and waste treatment usually the most polluting phase for both big ships winebrake et al 2007 and recreational ships like yachts cucinotta et al 2017a is the use phase due to the fuel consumption during the navigation the use phase is linked with the requested power and then with the resistance of the ship so it is important to know and estimate this quantity in design phase the principal two methods used for this evaluation are experimental tests towing tank tests and numerical tests virtual towing tank the combined use of the numerical and experimental methods helps researchers to find new solutions for the reduction of the drag the hull drag can be reduced acting on the pressure component with hull shape optimization and acting on the frictional component with passive and active technologies in the first case the process consists in the use of numerical optimization hull shape methods combination of computational fluid dynamics cfd surface shape manipulation and optimization methods for exploring a design space choosing the better solutions and so successively testing them in towing tank for experimental validation an interesting example of this procedure is reported by ghassabzadeh and ghassemi 2013 where thanks to nurbs approach a new mathematical hull surface reconstruction is proposed the surface reconstruction successively can be used inside a loop of optimization a similar approach is used by cella et al 2017 for the optimization of the sails during upwind navigation the innovative approach in this case is the use of the open source software kostas et al use a t spline method with the use of the bem isogeometric solver for capturing and optimize the better solutions for reducing the wave resistance kostas et al 2015 thanks to numerical approach the hull shape optimization is a standard procedure and the pressure component of a ship can be reduced drastically the researcher s goal now moved on the reduction of the frictional component of resistance with different methods in this case the viscosity of the fluid acting as a friction between the hull surface and the water produces the resistance a first attempt to reduce this quantity is the treatment of the hull surface with special coating in order to reduce the roughness principally caused by biofouling is reported by schultz 2007 a particular paint is proposed by stenzel et al 2011 it is made with micro structured coatings nanocomposites a second method concerns the use of the injection of the air in different ways microbubbles air layer in order to separate the water from the hull surface and so reducing the frictional a review of the all technologies developed for injecting air under the hull is reported by ahmadzadehtalatapeh and mousavi 2016 the microbubbles are highly influenced by the reynolds number and as shown by ferrante and elghobashi 2004 the positive effects diminish with the increase of the ship velocity this drawback led the researchers to push the studies in direction of the air cavity ships acs the air cavity is influenced by many parameters matveev 2003 in general the most important aspect is the quantity of air necessary to have a stable air layer under the hull and the surface of the hull that it is wetted by the air ceccio 2010 many experimental studies concern the use of a simplified model like a flat plate with different types of injection slyozkin et al 2014 tested a flat plate with air injection to various external velocities condition and with different air flow rate in order to better understand how the air spreads in the bottom hull surface pearce et al 2015 always with a flat plate model showed the influence of the reynolds number and the thickness of the boundary layer to various air flow rate on the propagation of the air under the hull this study is important in order to choice appropriately the better longitudinal position of the air injection under the hull with almost the same concept amromin 2016 tested a flat plate model and the influence of the boundary layer on the stability of the air cavity another important aspect is the scaling factor between the scale model and the real one in this sense the air flow rate could change significantly elbing et al 2013 thanks to a series of experimental tests on a big flat plate 12 9 m and with a velocity of 6 3 m s showed the influence of the incoming perturbation on the stability of the layer following the studies on flat plate the researchers start to study applications on scale model ship an example of application of air layer cavity on a container ship is reported by butterworth et al 2015 the experimental tests produced a drag reduction between 4 and 16 in the case of high speed ship an application of air cavity system is proposed by gokcay et al 2004 in the same field of application an experimental investigation of the behaviour of the air cavity of different bottom design for the same planning hull is proposed by cucinotta et al 2017b thanks to experimental tests is possible to validate numerical approach an example of this approach is proposed by matveev 2015 with a comparison between a numerical method and experimental test for a planing hull there are few studies conducted with the use of numerical approach and uranse method unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equation because the phenomena is very complex and it involves different hydrodynamic aspects a first attempt in order to solve this phenomena with the use of cfd for a simplified model is shown by cucinotta et al 2017c in this study the concept of bubbles and flat ventilated plate is treated with a cfd preliminary study barbaca et al simulated with the use of cfd commercial software a ventilated cavity flow over a 2 d wall mounted fence barbaca et al 2017 the main aim of this paper is to understand the potentiality of the cfd for solving these complex phenomena under the hull the method used is the uranse one with the use of a commercial software star ccm v 9 0 the paper describes each setup step by step and could be useful for the successive validation of other air cavity ships the approach is oriented to find the better setup for the simulations and a comparison with experimental data is proposed thanks to cfd is possible to take in account different phenomena and knowing the exact distribution of the air under the hull the results could be used for modifying the hull geometry in order to better accommodate the air layer see table 1 2 materials and methods 2 1 the model the geometric hull under study is a planing one with a step for the injection of the air the main dimensions are reported in table 2 but a more detailed description of this model is reported by cucinotta et al 2017b the model has a scale factor of 6 respect to the original mother boat that is an 18 m pleasure yacht planing hull a representation of the linesplan of the boat is reported in

injection under the bottom the blower has the following main characteristics nominal speed 3000 rpm air flow max 10 800 l min maximum power 54 w impeller diameter 190 mm 2 2 the cfd methods the principal aim of the cfd methods is solving hydrodynamic phenomena in order to quantify the unknown variables like velocity pressure free surface position and or rigid body motion the equations that govern the physic of this problem are the navier stokes ones they are based on two main principia mass conservation and momentum conservation these equations are a system of partial differential equations with a non linearity and with a 2nd order only for simplified hydrodynamic cases is possible to find a hand solution for complex phenomena these equations must be solved with a numerical approach with the increase of the computing power this set of equations is solved with various discretization methods ferziger and peric 2002 in this paper a finite volume method implemented in a commercial software is used in order to understand if this tool is suitable for this kind of problem 2 2 1 governing equations and simulation setup the uranse equations are solved thanks to an implicit and time marching solver the results allow to have all the hydrodynamic unknown variables during each time step the first choice was the method for solving the pressure and velocity field in this case a segregated flow approach is used the linkage between the momentum and continuity equations is achieved with a predictor corrector method deng and tang 2002 the turbulence model used in all simulations is the k omega sst menter menter and kuntz 2004 wilcox 2008 it is suitable both for planing hull and for the successively injection of the air the process of discretization leads to an algebraic system of equations that in this case is solved with an algebraic multigrid method stüben 2001 the hybrid method gauss least square gauss lsq solves all the gradients during the process of discretization it is a blending between the gauss method and least square method each simulation is conducted with a time marching approach in order to capturing the unsteady phenomena the temporal discretization is a 2nd order one the choice of the time step δ t is influenced by the general dimension and velocity of the ship like suggested by the ittc ittc 2011 with the equation 1 and by the grid dimensions with the courant number this last parameter must be kept low in order to have a good convergence condition 1 δ t 0 01 0 005 l v another important choice is the interface tracking method for the free surface and successively for the air injection in addition to the navier stokes equations a one more transport equation must be solved for the volume fraction of the two immiscible fluids the more suitable one is volume of fluid method vof the convection scheme used for the vof method is the hric high resolution interface capturing it allows to keep always a sharp interface between the two immiscible fluids the planing hull during the simulations is free to pitch and heave in order to capture the strong interaction between air and water a multiphase interaction with a surface tension equal to 0 072 n m between the two fluids is imposed the dynamic body interaction solver is activated and it allows to evaluate the acting hydrodynamic forces inside each time step and solving the rigid body equations for calculating the sinkage and trim of the hull a minimum of ten inner iterations are used in order to define the new position of the ship for each time step the mesh motion in consequence of the ship movement is managed with the overset technique that for high speed craft is better than morphing methodology as reported by de marco et al de marco et al 2017 thanks to this technique there isn t degradation of the cell elements principally when the trim angles are high and the accuracy near all the boundaries is kept always high a linear interpolation scheme is used for link the results between the background region and overset one a summary of the all setup for the numerical simulation is reported in table 3 2 2 2 geometry mesh strategy and boundary conditions two different regions the background one and the overset one divide the mesh fig 3 shows the principal dimensions of the background and overset regions like suggested with the recommendation of ittc ittc 2011 there are not specific conditions for the dimension of the overset block but it is better if there are sufficient grid elements between the boundary surface inside the overset region hull and the background region a 3d representation of the background and overset block is reported in fig 4 with the surfaces coloured in function of the relative boundary condition in this figure is possible to see the relative proportion of each dimension on left a zoom of the overset zone with the relative hull geometry on right in both images the boundary conditions applied are reported the principal aspect for the mesh is to be able to capture the main characteristics of the flow different block refinements are applied in different regions of the domain a general view of the mesh is reported in fig 5 the mesh is a trimmed one for both the two regions in fig 5 it is also possible to see a refinement zone for the free surface tracking and one in refinement zone in overset block the expansion is low from the inside overset zone to the out background one for a more detailed analysis the grid has been refined for the kelvin wake solution fig 6 left near the air injection zone fig 6 right and in correspondence of the wetted surface in order to avoid numerical ventilation in the overlapping zone between the overset region and the background one the dimension of the elements must be very similar in fig 7 it is possible to see that there is not difference between the elements inside the overset region and the ones in background region directly in contact with the overset interface this condition guarantees no overflow errors during the simulation and a very good interpolation condition in the fig 7 it is also possible observing the particular refinement of the free surface called butterfly refinement the software allows to choice different methods for the treatment of the boundary layer in order to keep the numbers of mesh low a high wall y treatment is used this particular approach allows to solve the boundary layer with the use of the wall functions the mesh must be defined in order to keep the wall y with a value higher than 30 a good range is between 60 and 130 in all simulations the average value of the wall y is 60 as shown in fig 8 the principal aspect for the boundary condition is imposing the initial free surface position design draught and the velocity of the flow the use of vof waves option allows simplifying this process this particular option provides a series of field function for initializing the vof calculation and defining the best profiles of the boundary conditions in our case the wave is flat and the inputs are the draught level and the velocities of the water table 5 inside the tank fig 9 all boundaries are directly linked to this particular option in order to take in account the presence of the two phases the inlet side top and bottom are imposed like velocity inlet with a field function for the velocity and the volume fraction the outlet is a pressure outlet with a pressure defined by a field function dependent on the free surface position in overset region the surfaces in contact with the background one are overset surfaces they are the surfaces where there is the interpolation of the results between the two regions the surface of the step is treated separately from the rest of the hull it is a wall in the first campaign of simulations and a flow rate inlet when there is the injection of the air 2 2 3 simulation campaigns the simulations were carried out in two different campaigns without air and with air injection the first campaign of simulations involves essentially the evaluation of the resistance curve of the hull the tested velocities are reported in table 5 for each velocity the simulation is conducted until to a stable condition of the all physical parameters like drag trim and sinkage an example of the monitoring of total drag force convergence is shown in fig 10 these parameters are compared with experimental results during this campaign of simulations an uncertainty analysis is conducted following the guidelines proposed by ittc ittc 2011 in general during a cfd simulation there are three main sources of uncertainty iterative ui grid ug and time step uncertainties ut the most important term of uncertainty is the grid as shown by stern stern et al 2001 it has an order of magnitude greater than the other two and the evaluation of this quantity is recommended for each simulation the used method has been the richardson one richardson 1911 the method consists in solving the same simulation problem with a minimum of three different meshes fine subscript 1 medium 2 and coarse 3 with a ratio between the number of cells r k constant the solutions of the n th parameter are respectively s n 1 s n 2 and s n 3 thanks to these three different solutions is possible to calculate the rate change for the solutions between the coarse mesh and medium mesh 2 and between the medium mesh and the fine mesh 3 2 ε n 21 s n 2 s n 1 3 ε n 32 s n 2 s n 3 with these two quantities it is possible to evaluate the convergence ratio 4 and the order of accuracy 5 of the simulation the behaviour of the convergence ratio is important in order to understand the simulation tendency table 4 4 r g ε n 21 ε n 32 5 p g l n ε n 32 ε n 21 ln r k the generalized form of the richardson extrapolation method allows evaluating the uncertainty with the relation 6 the safety factor f s can be a constant value as defined by roache 1998 or a dynamic value that change in function of the type of convergence of the simulation as suggested by stern et al 2001 in all cases where a monotonic convergence is obtained the safety factor is equal to 1 6 u n f s ε n 21 r g p g 1 the results of the first campaign are the boundary condition for the second campaign of tests in this case the step hull boundary condition becomes an air flowrate inlet the simulation evolves until to reach a stable condition the flowrate tested are included between 5500 l min and 10 500 l min with a step of 1000 l min the time step in this case is lower than the one used for the curve resistance simulations 2 3 the towing tank tests the tests have been carried out in the towing tank test of naples university italy which is certified by the ittc international towing tank conference using the froude method according to ittc 57 each instrument used is certified by the towing tank the towing tank is 135 5 m length 9 0 m width and a depth of 4 5 m the model has been towed at the same 8 velocities of the cfd campaigns see table 5 for each air flowrate from the no air condition to 10 500 l min in the fig 11 are reported the results in terms of drag resistance while in table 6 are reported the percentage towing force saving in the fig 12 it is possible to see the different wave pattern of the boat at two different velocities in the no air condition and with an air rate of 8500 l min at increasing velocity it is possible to observe the planing of the model and a drastic reduction and recession of the spray area it corresponds to the passing of the hump in the curve further details in the towing tank campaign are discussed by cucinotta et al 2017b 3 results and discussion the first part of this chapter concerns the evaluation of the resistance curve and the parameters that were extrapolated by the cfd simulations the resistance curve and ship motion characteristics are compared with experimental data the second part concerns the evaluation of the uncertainty of the results respect to the used mesh finally the air injection problem was investigated for this aim the results of the first campaign are used as boundary condition 3 1 resistance curves the first campaign table 7 shows the values of the resistance in both cases experimental and simulated the percentage difference is always under the value of 5 except for the first velocity condition where it reaches the 8 a representation of the resistance curve as shown fig 13 allows seeing the characteristic humps and hollows of the planing hull see table 8 the other parameters that were compared between experimental and virtual tests are trim and sinkage of the boat also in this case as shown fig 14 the humps and hollows in the curves during the experimental tests are solved also with the cfd simulation thanks to cfd simulations it is possible to split the total resistance in its principal components frictional and pressure drag the impact of each of them on the total resistance is shown in table 9 the pressure component is the most important and it takes in account the effects of the waves and spray energy losses however increasing the velocity the percentage of the frictional resistance increases in an important way the wetted surface is another variable that can be evaluated during the cfd simulations in the experimental tests the wetted surface is conventionally considered the same of the static condition regardless of the tested velocity and the consequent trim and sinkage besides the wave and spray wetted surfaces this approximation leads to an incorrect assessment of the drag components mostly in the case of planing hulls it is a great approximation because the wetted surface decreases rapidly increasing the velocity principally when the hull reaches the planing condition table 10 shows this decrease in particular when the fn is bigger than 0 9 the wetted surface goes rapidly down and it becomes about 70 of the static one fig 15 the assessment of this quantity is important also to evaluate the effect of the air injection successively fig 16 shows the air volume fraction under the hull it is important to note that the refinement of mesh near the keel allows keeping the artificial numerical ventilation under control and the impacts on the results are negligible in the same figure it is also possible to see the difference between low and high froude conditions when the boat reaches 6 3 m s the sides are completely out of water fig 17 helps to compare experimental and numerical wave pattern at a low froude condition fn 1 and at the maximum velocity condition it is also interesting to see that the detachment of the spray in both cases along the chine that at high speed can reduce dramatically the wetted surface 3 2 uncertainty analysis the uncertainty analysis has been carried out with three different meshes the condition analysed is the one corresponding to the maximum value of froude the three different meshes have a ratio like suggested by the ittc procedures about equal to 1 41 table 11 and table 12 show the parameters and results of the uncertainty analysis for each parameter the grid convergence ratio is lower than 1 and therefore the solution is convergent in the case of planing hull a coarse mesh leads to numerical diffusion this phenomenon influences the total resistance that is the most affected parameter as it is showed by the lowest value of rg the value u is expressed as a percentage of the respective result for the finest mesh 3 3 air injection the second campaign the results of the first part of simulations are used as boundary conditions for these simulations as reported above in this campaign the step surface become a flow rate inlet for each condition of flow rate a comparison between the experimental resistance curves and cfd results are reported fig 18 fig 19 fig 20 all the curves agree well with the experimental tests in general the difference between experimental and cfd simulations is below 6 only in the case of flow rate of 10 500 l min with a froude number equal to 1 148 this difference reaches values of 8 in all cases the differences are largely acceptable in fig 21 all the cfd curves are plotted in the same graph they are always below the one without air therefore the injection of the air is a benefit in all conditions in the same figure the trend is the same of experimental tests fig 11 there are two different zones a first one for a froude number less than 1 where the flow rate does not influence the decrease of the resistance and the curves are very similar to each other a second zone with the froude higher than 1 where the flow rate is important and there is a separation of the curves in this condition of velocity a higher value of flow rate leads to a greater decrease of resistance at the highest condition 10 500 l min and fn 1 36 the blower power 54 w corresponds to the 3 6 of the drag power of the model considering a typical global efficiency of the power chain of a boat propeller transmission and gear of about 0 55 it is possible to foresee a fraction of about 2 of the brake power another important aspect in which cfd plays a crucial role is the assessment of distribution of the air under the hull thanks to cfd it is possible to evaluate the wetted area that decreases increasing the air injection in the curves showed in fig 22 it is reported the ratio between the dynamic wetted area with air injection and the dynamic wetted area without air injection varying the flow rate and the fn there is a general similar trend with a shift downward when the flow rate increases a particular aspect is the peak for all curves near the value of 1 of the fn this peak is a consequence of the starting of the boat planing the fig 23 shows the distribution of the air under the hull to an equal flow rate but at different froude numbers the high velocity condition fn 1 helps to keep the air under the hull with a good drag reduction for lower velocities fn 1 the air starts to escape by the sides and less air is distributed under the hull moreover the air that escapes along the sides has a good effect in the displacement condition thanks to the reduction of the wetted surface in that zones instead when the planing is starting fn 1 the air lost along the sides is useless because the sides are already naturally dried and the bottom is widely wetted this leads to the peak on the curves on fig 22 the relative speed between air and water depends on the flowrate and on the speed of the boat for this reason with the same air flow as the speed increases the dragging effect helps the air layer to follow the shapes of the bottom avoiding its escape along the sides the fig 24 shows the volume fraction in the sections it is possible to observe that in planing condition the sides are well ventilated also without the air injection moreover thanks to the air injection the model has a wide ventilation also along the hull bottom the fig 24 shows also the thickness distribution near the nozzles in correspondence of the step the layer is developed along the entire breadth and the thickness of this air layer is equal to the height of the step the effect of the cushion around the hull is even more visible in displacement condition fn 1 in which the sides are wetted during the navigation without air injection fig 25 left instead in fig 25 on the right the air injection is shown that produces a clear separation between the water and the sides of the hull 4 conclusions in this paper a planing air cavity yacht has been investigated by the use of cfd and uranse methods the principal aim is to understand the potentiality of the cfd simulations for this kind of problem a first part of paper concerns the evaluation of the resistance curve without air injection and the prediction of the trim and sinkage by post processing of the cfd results the wetted area has been evaluated all setup for the mesh and the solver are described and the technique of overset mesh is used in order to take in account the motion of the hull a comparison between the experimental tests and simulations results is proposed in order to validate the virtual tests and verify the differences the difference between the two methods is always lower than 5 during this phase an assessment of the uncertainty is conducted in order to quantify the percentage of uncertainty respect to the mesh used during all simulations the finest one the second part deals with the injection of the air with different flow rates the flow rates investigated are between 5500 l min and 10 500 l min with steps of 1000 l min with the injection of the air for each condition of flow rate the resistance curve is lower than one without air injection the dependence on flow rate starts to increase with the increase of velocity all the cfd resistance curves are compared with the experimental ones in this case the differences are always lower than 5 except for one case an important aspect of the cfd is the post processing in particular the visualization of the streamlines and of the air distribution under the hull at the same flow rate condition the increase of velocity allows to keep the air completely in the cavity when the velocity decreases part of this air escapes along the sides this effect is positive when the sides are wetted by water displacement condition the peaks in the curves highlight the passage between a positive effect and negative effect the phenomenon occurs around the froude number of one the distribution of the thickness of the air under the hull is showed for different transversal sections the distribution of the air under the vessel can be improved in different ways by changing several geometric parameters as e g the longitudinal position the breadth and the height of the step or the deadrise angle thanks to the methodology exposed above it is possible to carry out simulation campaigns of different cavity shapes in order to find the best solutions in different conditions with a numerical approach it is possible to conduct these tests in a more rapid and cheaper way than with the experimental towing tank one the cfd method principally in preliminary phase is a very useful tool for these kind of problems it helps better understanding the distribution of the air injected under the hull with the use of cfd is possible to verify different shapes of bottom hull and the influence of each parameter the cfd analysis allows to speed up the optimization process and to improve the knowledge of new and no standard applications acknowledgments this work was partially supported by european union pon r c 2007 2013 funding authors wish to thank the personnel of naples towing tank for the support during the experimental tests and the staff of vienna model basin for the precious comments and suggestions for cfd simulations 
23574,the needs to reduce the frictional component of the resistance of a ship leads researchers to find new solutions the air cavity solution seems to be one of the most promising one usually it is very difficult with the experimental tests to understand the air distribution under the hull and the streamlines during the injection of air the principal objective of this paper is evaluating the potentiality of the cfd approach in the study of air cavity ships acs for a planing yacht the first part of paper describes the cfd evaluation of the resistance curves without air injection the second part deals with the injection of the air under the hull in this case the boundary conditions are the results of the first campaign of simulations a comparison between the experimental and cfd results is shown an assessment of the streamlines and air distribution is proposed and an evaluation of the wetted and ventilated areas is conducted in order to understand the relation between the flow rate the velocity of the hull and the air distribution the results can be used for modifying the hull geometry in order to better accommodate the air layer keywords computational fluid dynamics air cavity ship hull design ship resistance computer aided engineering 1 introduction a common theme in design and research in the last years is the green thinking oriented to reduce the environmental impact of products every manufacture has an environmental impact in each phase of its life and in order to obtain the better results the engineers have to find new solutions for reducing them a great deal of work was done in the naval engineering for reducing in each part the environmental impact of a ship life the principal polluting causes can be divided in three different phases manufacturing use phase and waste treatment usually the most polluting phase for both big ships winebrake et al 2007 and recreational ships like yachts cucinotta et al 2017a is the use phase due to the fuel consumption during the navigation the use phase is linked with the requested power and then with the resistance of the ship so it is important to know and estimate this quantity in design phase the principal two methods used for this evaluation are experimental tests towing tank tests and numerical tests virtual towing tank the combined use of the numerical and experimental methods helps researchers to find new solutions for the reduction of the drag the hull drag can be reduced acting on the pressure component with hull shape optimization and acting on the frictional component with passive and active technologies in the first case the process consists in the use of numerical optimization hull shape methods combination of computational fluid dynamics cfd surface shape manipulation and optimization methods for exploring a design space choosing the better solutions and so successively testing them in towing tank for experimental validation an interesting example of this procedure is reported by ghassabzadeh and ghassemi 2013 where thanks to nurbs approach a new mathematical hull surface reconstruction is proposed the surface reconstruction successively can be used inside a loop of optimization a similar approach is used by cella et al 2017 for the optimization of the sails during upwind navigation the innovative approach in this case is the use of the open source software kostas et al use a t spline method with the use of the bem isogeometric solver for capturing and optimize the better solutions for reducing the wave resistance kostas et al 2015 thanks to numerical approach the hull shape optimization is a standard procedure and the pressure component of a ship can be reduced drastically the researcher s goal now moved on the reduction of the frictional component of resistance with different methods in this case the viscosity of the fluid acting as a friction between the hull surface and the water produces the resistance a first attempt to reduce this quantity is the treatment of the hull surface with special coating in order to reduce the roughness principally caused by biofouling is reported by schultz 2007 a particular paint is proposed by stenzel et al 2011 it is made with micro structured coatings nanocomposites a second method concerns the use of the injection of the air in different ways microbubbles air layer in order to separate the water from the hull surface and so reducing the frictional a review of the all technologies developed for injecting air under the hull is reported by ahmadzadehtalatapeh and mousavi 2016 the microbubbles are highly influenced by the reynolds number and as shown by ferrante and elghobashi 2004 the positive effects diminish with the increase of the ship velocity this drawback led the researchers to push the studies in direction of the air cavity ships acs the air cavity is influenced by many parameters matveev 2003 in general the most important aspect is the quantity of air necessary to have a stable air layer under the hull and the surface of the hull that it is wetted by the air ceccio 2010 many experimental studies concern the use of a simplified model like a flat plate with different types of injection slyozkin et al 2014 tested a flat plate with air injection to various external velocities condition and with different air flow rate in order to better understand how the air spreads in the bottom hull surface pearce et al 2015 always with a flat plate model showed the influence of the reynolds number and the thickness of the boundary layer to various air flow rate on the propagation of the air under the hull this study is important in order to choice appropriately the better longitudinal position of the air injection under the hull with almost the same concept amromin 2016 tested a flat plate model and the influence of the boundary layer on the stability of the air cavity another important aspect is the scaling factor between the scale model and the real one in this sense the air flow rate could change significantly elbing et al 2013 thanks to a series of experimental tests on a big flat plate 12 9 m and with a velocity of 6 3 m s showed the influence of the incoming perturbation on the stability of the layer following the studies on flat plate the researchers start to study applications on scale model ship an example of application of air layer cavity on a container ship is reported by butterworth et al 2015 the experimental tests produced a drag reduction between 4 and 16 in the case of high speed ship an application of air cavity system is proposed by gokcay et al 2004 in the same field of application an experimental investigation of the behaviour of the air cavity of different bottom design for the same planning hull is proposed by cucinotta et al 2017b thanks to experimental tests is possible to validate numerical approach an example of this approach is proposed by matveev 2015 with a comparison between a numerical method and experimental test for a planing hull there are few studies conducted with the use of numerical approach and uranse method unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equation because the phenomena is very complex and it involves different hydrodynamic aspects a first attempt in order to solve this phenomena with the use of cfd for a simplified model is shown by cucinotta et al 2017c in this study the concept of bubbles and flat ventilated plate is treated with a cfd preliminary study barbaca et al simulated with the use of cfd commercial software a ventilated cavity flow over a 2 d wall mounted fence barbaca et al 2017 the main aim of this paper is to understand the potentiality of the cfd for solving these complex phenomena under the hull the method used is the uranse one with the use of a commercial software star ccm v 9 0 the paper describes each setup step by step and could be useful for the successive validation of other air cavity ships the approach is oriented to find the better setup for the simulations and a comparison with experimental data is proposed thanks to cfd is possible to take in account different phenomena and knowing the exact distribution of the air under the hull the results could be used for modifying the hull geometry in order to better accommodate the air layer see table 1 2 materials and methods 2 1 the model the geometric hull under study is a planing one with a step for the injection of the air the main dimensions are reported in table 2 but a more detailed description of this model is reported by cucinotta et al 2017b the model has a scale factor of 6 respect to the original mother boat that is an 18 m pleasure yacht planing hull a representation of the linesplan of the boat is reported in fig 1 in fig 2 is shown the curve of the immersed area of the transversal section with the discontinuity in the step section to the design draught a dc 48 v centrifugal air blower supplies the air injection under the bottom the blower has the following main characteristics nominal speed 3000 rpm air flow max 10 800 l min maximum power 54 w impeller diameter 190 mm 2 2 the cfd methods the principal aim of the cfd methods is solving hydrodynamic phenomena in order to quantify the unknown variables like velocity pressure free surface position and or rigid body motion the equations that govern the physic of this problem are the navier stokes ones they are based on two main principia mass conservation and momentum conservation these equations are a system of partial differential equations with a non linearity and with a 2nd order only for simplified hydrodynamic cases is possible to find a hand solution for complex phenomena these equations must be solved with a numerical approach with the increase of the computing power this set of equations is solved with various discretization methods ferziger and peric 2002 in this paper a finite volume method implemented in a commercial software is used in order to understand if this tool is suitable for this kind of problem 2 2 1 governing equations and simulation setup the uranse equations are solved thanks to an implicit and time marching solver the results allow to have all the hydrodynamic unknown variables during each time step the first choice was the method for solving the pressure and velocity field in this case a segregated flow approach is used the linkage between the momentum and continuity equations is achieved with a predictor corrector method deng and tang 2002 the turbulence model used in all simulations is the k omega sst menter menter and kuntz 2004 wilcox 2008 it is suitable both for planing hull and for the successively injection of the air the process of discretization leads to an algebraic system of equations that in this case is solved with an algebraic multigrid method stüben 2001 the hybrid method gauss least square gauss lsq solves all the gradients during the process of discretization it is a blending between the gauss method and least square method each simulation is conducted with a time marching approach in order to capturing the unsteady phenomena the temporal discretization is a 2nd order one the choice of the time step δ t is influenced by the general dimension and velocity of the ship like suggested by the ittc ittc 2011 with the equation 1 and by the grid dimensions with the courant number this last parameter must be kept low in order to have a good convergence condition 1 δ t 0 01 0 005 l v another important choice is the interface tracking method for the free surface and successively for the air injection in addition to the navier stokes equations a one more transport equation must be solved for the volume fraction of the two immiscible fluids the more suitable one is volume of fluid method vof the convection scheme used for the vof method is the hric high resolution interface capturing it allows to keep always a sharp interface between the two immiscible fluids the planing hull during the simulations is free to pitch and heave in order to capture the strong interaction between air and water a multiphase interaction with a surface tension equal to 0 072 n m between the two fluids is imposed the dynamic body interaction solver is activated and it allows to evaluate the acting hydrodynamic forces inside each time step and solving the rigid body equations for calculating the sinkage and trim of the hull a minimum of ten inner iterations are used in order to define the new position of the ship for each time step the mesh motion in consequence of the ship movement is managed with the overset technique that for high speed craft is better than morphing methodology as reported by de marco et al de marco et al 2017 thanks to this technique there isn t degradation of the cell elements principally when the trim angles are high and the accuracy near all the boundaries is kept always high a linear interpolation scheme is used for link the results between the background region and overset one a summary of the all setup for the numerical simulation is reported in table 3 2 2 2 geometry mesh strategy and boundary conditions two different regions the background one and the overset one divide the mesh fig 3 shows the principal dimensions of the background and overset regions like suggested with the recommendation of ittc ittc 2011 there are not specific conditions for the dimension of the overset block but it is better if there are sufficient grid elements between the boundary surface inside the overset region hull and the background region a 3d representation of the background and overset block is reported in fig 4 with the surfaces coloured in function of the relative boundary condition in this figure is possible to see the relative proportion of each dimension on left a zoom of the overset zone with the relative hull geometry on right in both images the boundary conditions applied are reported the principal aspect for the mesh is to be able to capture the main characteristics of the flow different block refinements are applied in different regions of the domain a general view of the mesh is reported in fig 5 the mesh is a trimmed one for both the two regions in fig 5 it is also possible to see a refinement zone for the free surface tracking and one in refinement zone in overset block the expansion is low from the inside overset zone to the out background one for a more detailed analysis the grid has been refined for the kelvin wake solution fig 6 left near the air injection zone fig 6 right and in correspondence of the wetted surface in order to avoid numerical ventilation in the overlapping zone between the overset region and the background one the dimension of the elements must be very similar in fig 7 it is possible to see that there is not difference between the elements inside the overset region and the ones in background region directly in contact with the overset interface this condition guarantees no overflow errors during the simulation and a very good interpolation condition in the fig 7 it is also possible observing the particular refinement of the free surface called butterfly refinement the software allows to choice different methods for the treatment of the boundary layer in order to keep the numbers of mesh low a high wall y treatment is used this particular approach allows to solve the boundary layer with the use of the wall functions the mesh must be defined in order to keep the wall y with a value higher than 30 a good range is between 60 and 130 in all simulations the average value of the wall y is 60 as shown in fig 8 the principal aspect for the boundary condition is imposing the initial free surface position design draught and the velocity of the flow the use of vof waves option allows simplifying this process this particular option provides a series of field function for initializing the vof calculation and defining the best profiles of the boundary conditions in our case the wave is flat and the inputs are the draught level and the velocities of the water table 5 inside the tank fig 9 all boundaries are directly linked to this particular option in order to take in account the presence of the two phases the inlet side top and bottom are imposed like velocity inlet with a field function for the velocity and the volume fraction the outlet is a pressure outlet with a pressure defined by a field function dependent on the free surface position in overset region the surfaces in contact with the background one are overset surfaces they are the surfaces where there is the interpolation of the results between the two regions the surface of the step is treated separately from the rest of the hull it is a wall in the first campaign of simulations and a flow rate inlet when there is the injection of the air 2 2 3 simulation campaigns the simulations were carried out in two different campaigns without air and with air injection the first campaign of simulations involves essentially the evaluation of the resistance curve of the hull the tested velocities are reported in table 5 for each velocity the simulation is conducted until to a stable condition of the all physical parameters like drag trim and sinkage an example of the monitoring of total drag force convergence is shown in fig 10 these parameters are compared with experimental results during this campaign of simulations an uncertainty analysis is conducted following the guidelines proposed by ittc ittc 2011 in general during a cfd simulation there are three main sources of uncertainty iterative ui grid ug and time step uncertainties ut the most important term of uncertainty is the grid as shown by stern stern et al 2001 it has an order of magnitude greater than the other two and the evaluation of this quantity is recommended for each simulation the used method has been the richardson one richardson 1911 the method consists in solving the same simulation problem with a minimum of three different meshes fine subscript 1 medium 2 and coarse 3 with a ratio between the number of cells r k constant the solutions of the n th parameter are respectively s n 1 s n 2 and s n 3 thanks to these three different solutions is possible to calculate the rate change for the solutions between the coarse mesh and medium mesh 2 and between the medium mesh and the fine mesh 3 2 ε n 21 s n 2 s n 1 3 ε n 32 s n 2 s n 3 with these two quantities it is possible to evaluate the convergence ratio 4 and the order of accuracy 5 of the simulation the behaviour of the convergence ratio is important in order to understand the simulation tendency table 4 4 r g ε n 21 ε n 32 5 p g l n ε n 32 ε n 21 ln r k the generalized form of the richardson extrapolation method allows evaluating the uncertainty with the relation 6 the safety factor f s can be a constant value as defined by roache 1998 or a dynamic value that change in function of the type of convergence of the simulation as suggested by stern et al 2001 in all cases where a monotonic convergence is obtained the safety factor is equal to 1 6 u n f s ε n 21 r g p g 1 the results of the first campaign are the boundary condition for the second campaign of tests in this case the step hull boundary condition becomes an air flowrate inlet the simulation evolves until to reach a stable condition the flowrate tested are included between 5500 l min and 10 500 l min with a step of 1000 l min the time step in this case is lower than the one used for the curve resistance simulations 2 3 the towing tank tests the tests have been carried out in the towing tank test of naples university italy which is certified by the ittc international towing tank conference using the froude method according to ittc 57 each instrument used is certified by the towing tank the towing tank is 135 5 m length 9 0 m width and a depth of 4 5 m the model has been towed at the same 8 velocities of the cfd campaigns see table 5 for each air flowrate from the no air condition to 10 500 l min in the fig 11 are reported the results in terms of drag resistance while in table 6 are reported the percentage towing force saving in the fig 12 it is possible to see the different wave pattern of the boat at two different velocities in the no air condition and with an air rate of 8500 l min at increasing velocity it is possible to observe the planing of the model and a drastic reduction and recession of the spray area it corresponds to the passing of the hump in the curve further details in the towing tank campaign are discussed by cucinotta et al 2017b 3 results and discussion the first part of this chapter concerns the evaluation of the resistance curve and the parameters that were extrapolated by the cfd simulations the resistance curve and ship motion characteristics are compared with experimental data the second part concerns the evaluation of the uncertainty of the results respect to the used mesh finally the air injection problem was investigated for this aim the results of the first campaign are used as boundary condition 3 1 resistance curves the first campaign table 7 shows the values of the resistance in both cases experimental and simulated the percentage difference is always under the value of 5 except for the first velocity condition where it reaches the 8 a representation of the resistance curve as shown fig 13 allows seeing the characteristic humps and hollows of the planing hull see table 8 the other parameters that were compared between experimental and virtual tests are trim and sinkage of the boat also in this case as shown fig 14 the humps and hollows in the curves during the experimental tests are solved also with the cfd simulation thanks to cfd simulations it is possible to split the total resistance in its principal components frictional and pressure drag the impact of each of them on the total resistance is shown in table 9 the pressure component is the most important and it takes in account the effects of the waves and spray energy losses however increasing the velocity the percentage of the frictional resistance increases in an important way the wetted surface is another variable that can be evaluated during the cfd simulations in the experimental tests the wetted surface is conventionally considered the same of the static condition regardless of the tested velocity and the consequent trim and sinkage besides the wave and spray wetted surfaces this approximation leads to an incorrect assessment of the drag components mostly in the case of planing hulls it is a great approximation because the wetted surface decreases rapidly increasing the velocity principally when the hull reaches the planing condition table 10 shows this decrease in particular when the fn is bigger than 0 9 the wetted surface goes rapidly down and it becomes about 70 of the static one fig 15 the assessment of this quantity is important also to evaluate the effect of the air injection successively fig 16 shows the air volume fraction under the hull it is important to note that the refinement of mesh near the keel allows keeping the artificial numerical ventilation under control and the impacts on the results are negligible in the same figure it is also possible to see the difference between low and high froude conditions when the boat reaches 6 3 m s the sides are completely out of water fig 17 helps to compare experimental and numerical wave pattern at a low froude condition fn 1 and at the maximum velocity condition it is also interesting to see that the detachment of the spray in both cases along the chine that at high speed can reduce dramatically the wetted surface 3 2 uncertainty analysis the uncertainty analysis has been carried out with three different meshes the condition analysed is the one corresponding to the maximum value of froude the three different meshes have a ratio like suggested by the ittc procedures about equal to 1 41 table 11 and table 12 show the parameters and results of the uncertainty analysis for each parameter the grid convergence ratio is lower than 1 and therefore the solution is convergent in the case of planing hull a coarse mesh leads to numerical diffusion this phenomenon influences the total resistance that is the most affected parameter as it is showed by the lowest value of rg the value u is expressed as a percentage of the respective result for the finest mesh 3 3 air injection the second campaign the results of the first part of simulations are used as boundary conditions for these simulations as reported above in this campaign the step surface become a flow rate inlet for each condition of flow rate a comparison between the experimental resistance curves and cfd results are reported fig 18 fig 19 fig 20 all the curves agree well with the experimental tests in general the difference between experimental and cfd simulations is below 6 only in the case of flow rate of 10 500 l min with a froude number equal to 1 148 this difference reaches values of 8 in all cases the differences are largely acceptable in fig 21 all the cfd curves are plotted in the same graph they are always below the one without air therefore the injection of the air is a benefit in all conditions in the same figure the trend is the same of experimental tests fig 11 there are two different zones a first one for a froude number less than 1 where the flow rate does not influence the decrease of the resistance and the curves are very similar to each other a second zone with the froude higher than 1 where the flow rate is important and there is a separation of the curves in this condition of velocity a higher value of flow rate leads to a greater decrease of resistance at the highest condition 10 500 l min and fn 1 36 the blower power 54 w corresponds to the 3 6 of the drag power of the model considering a typical global efficiency of the power chain of a boat propeller transmission and gear of about 0 55 it is possible to foresee a fraction of about 2 of the brake power another important aspect in which cfd plays a crucial role is the assessment of distribution of the air under the hull thanks to cfd it is possible to evaluate the wetted area that decreases increasing the air injection in the curves showed in fig 22 it is reported the ratio between the dynamic wetted area with air injection and the dynamic wetted area without air injection varying the flow rate and the fn there is a general similar trend with a shift downward when the flow rate increases a particular aspect is the peak for all curves near the value of 1 of the fn this peak is a consequence of the starting of the boat planing the fig 23 shows the distribution of the air under the hull to an equal flow rate but at different froude numbers the high velocity condition fn 1 helps to keep the air under the hull with a good drag reduction for lower velocities fn 1 the air starts to escape by the sides and less air is distributed under the hull moreover the air that escapes along the sides has a good effect in the displacement condition thanks to the reduction of the wetted surface in that zones instead when the planing is starting fn 1 the air lost along the sides is useless because the sides are already naturally dried and the bottom is widely wetted this leads to the peak on the curves on fig 22 the relative speed between air and water depends on the flowrate and on the speed of the boat for this reason with the same air flow as the speed increases the dragging effect helps the air layer to follow the shapes of the bottom avoiding its escape along the sides the fig 24 shows the volume fraction in the sections it is possible to observe that in planing condition the sides are well ventilated also without the air injection moreover thanks to the air injection the model has a wide ventilation also along the hull bottom the fig 24 shows also the thickness distribution near the nozzles in correspondence of the step the layer is developed along the entire breadth and the thickness of this air layer is equal to the height of the step the effect of the cushion around the hull is even more visible in displacement condition fn 1 in which the sides are wetted during the navigation without air injection fig 25 left instead in fig 25 on the right the air injection is shown that produces a clear separation between the water and the sides of the hull 4 conclusions in this paper a planing air cavity yacht has been investigated by the use of cfd and uranse methods the principal aim is to understand the potentiality of the cfd simulations for this kind of problem a first part of paper concerns the evaluation of the resistance curve without air injection and the prediction of the trim and sinkage by post processing of the cfd results the wetted area has been evaluated all setup for the mesh and the solver are described and the technique of overset mesh is used in order to take in account the motion of the hull a comparison between the experimental tests and simulations results is proposed in order to validate the virtual tests and verify the differences the difference between the two methods is always lower than 5 during this phase an assessment of the uncertainty is conducted in order to quantify the percentage of uncertainty respect to the mesh used during all simulations the finest one the second part deals with the injection of the air with different flow rates the flow rates investigated are between 5500 l min and 10 500 l min with steps of 1000 l min with the injection of the air for each condition of flow rate the resistance curve is lower than one without air injection the dependence on flow rate starts to increase with the increase of velocity all the cfd resistance curves are compared with the experimental ones in this case the differences are always lower than 5 except for one case an important aspect of the cfd is the post processing in particular the visualization of the streamlines and of the air distribution under the hull at the same flow rate condition the increase of velocity allows to keep the air completely in the cavity when the velocity decreases part of this air escapes along the sides this effect is positive when the sides are wetted by water displacement condition the peaks in the curves highlight the passage between a positive effect and negative effect the phenomenon occurs around the froude number of one the distribution of the thickness of the air under the hull is showed for different transversal sections the distribution of the air under the vessel can be improved in different ways by changing several geometric parameters as e g the longitudinal position the breadth and the height of the step or the deadrise angle thanks to the methodology exposed above it is possible to carry out simulation campaigns of different cavity shapes in order to find the best solutions in different conditions with a numerical approach it is possible to conduct these tests in a more rapid and cheaper way than with the experimental towing tank one the cfd method principally in preliminary phase is a very useful tool for these kind of problems it helps better understanding the distribution of the air injected under the hull with the use of cfd is possible to verify different shapes of bottom hull and the influence of each parameter the cfd analysis allows to speed up the optimization process and to improve the knowledge of new and no standard applications acknowledgments this work was partially supported by european union pon r c 2007 2013 funding authors wish to thank the personnel of
