14295,flotation separation and hydrocyclone separation are physical or physicochemical techniques that can be widely used to separate oily wastewater the main way to strengthen the separation of high emulsification and fine oil droplets from the oil water emulsion is to further improve cooperative effects of flotation and hydrocyclone a novel bicyclone flotation column which combines the cyclonic separation and flotation separation was developed and applied for the treatment of produced water from asp flooding with fine oil droplets in this work the effect of velocity vector distribution the turbulence kinetic energy and the turbulence dissipation rate in bicyclone flotation column were primarily investigated by numerical simulations the results show that a 1 0 m s inlet velocity of circular processing influent is appropriate for the turbulent flow environment of the bicyclone flotation column lab scale and field experiments for treating produced water from asp flooding were carried out by using a bicyclone flotation column the results show that the treated effluent with a final oil concentration of below 50 mg l can meet the oil concentration requirement for a bicyclone flotation column and dissolved air flotation device the oil droplet size d 50 in the effluent is 3 97 μm and 7 21 μm respectively this means that the bicyclone flotation column is especially effective for separating fine oil droplets from the produced water from asp flooding keywords produced water from asp flooding oil water separation flotation column bicyclone computational fluid dynamics cfd 1 introduction oil exploitation includes primary recovery secondary recovery and tertiary recovery with oil recovery of the three stages of 10 15 30 50 and 50 70 respectively 1 asp alkali surfactant and polymer flooding is an eor technique where alkali surfactant and polymer are injected in the same slug and gradual enhancement of oil recovery has been found to increase oil recovery by over 20 2 however the produced water from asp flooding is a typically an oil water o w emulsion with high phase stability high emulsification high viscosity and a large amount of fine oil droplets which is difficult to treat and limits the asp flooding technique from further application in oilfields 3 4 in recent years many technologies have been developed to treat oily wastewater from eor ding 5 developed a purely physical process of material coalescence cyclone coalescence dissolved nitrogen flotation for produced water from polymer flooding where the outlet oil content remained less than 50 mg l liu et al 6 used a magnetic flotation process to treat oily wastewater by adding feo coagulants and a stabilizer cao et al 7 used electro flotation technology to dispose of oilfield wastewater suspended solids and oil content were reduced from 88 3 mg l and 106 mg l to 1 6 mg l and 2 1 mg l respectively shi et al 8 investigated the effect of an inclined plate dissolved air flotation method on the treatment of oil bearing wastewater in an oil field where the oil content of the treated water was below 10 mg l zhang et al 9 combined t junction separator equipment where new bubble generators were assembled the oil removal test was carried out on an offshore platform where the content of oil was reduced to 12 mg l liu et al 10 developed a compact air sparged hydrocyclone device combined a cyclonic separation and air sparge technology and the de oiling efficiency was maintained at around 80 li et al 11 developed a device using a tubular cyclone separator with microporous air flotation and dissolved air flotation technology and applied it to offshore oil platforms the oilfield pilot test shows that the device can reduce the oil content of oily wastewater from 494 mg l to 46 3 mg l and the concentration of suspended solids from 269 mg l to 41 mg l sun et al 12 presented a new closed circulating air flotation device and optimized the air flotation test apparatus in closed circulating system the treatment effect of the closed circulating air floating device was found to be better than traditional air flotation devices wei et al 13 provided a new two stage air flotation cyclone that could reduce the oil concentration to 20 mg l wang 14 developed a vortex floating technology on the floating production storage and offloading vessel of the offshore oilfield in the western south china sea where the outlet oil in water is 15 mg l when the inlet oil in water is 70 mg l di et al 15 investigated a combined process of air floating hydrolysis acidification biological contact oxidation and filtration for the treatment of asp flooding produced water the concentrations of suspended solids ss and oil content in the effluent could meet the standard of high permeability reservoir injection water ding et al 16 carried out experiments on the treatment of produced water from asp flooding using a two stage dissolved air flotation process after adding a water quality regulator and a composite flocculant the content of suspended solid and oil in effluent was reduced to 20 mg l liu et al 17 used bubble column flotation to treat oily wastewater from an oilfield physical or physicochemical techniques such as flotation separation and hydrocyclone separation have advantages of higher efficiency large disposal simple structure and lower operational cost however the removal efficiency for oil droplets sizes below 8 μm is smaller than 40 when using a single method improvements to conventional flotation performance generally requires increasing the residence time and effective volume of the flotation devices and flotation separation devices are not suitable for wider range oil concentrations in the separation of oily wastewater in addition some normally structured hydrocyclones have additional drawbacks for treating emulsified oil when the oil droplet size is less than 8 μm in order to shorten the residence time and improve the efficiency of oil in water emulsions separation a novel bicyclone flotation column which combines cyclonic separation and flotation separation is developed and applied for the treatment of produced water from asp flooding with fine oil droplets in this work this work focuses on the bicyclonic flow field environment in the column a cfd method has been employed to obtain pivotal flow field information related to the turbulent flow environment of bicyclone structure finally a bicyclone flotation column was manufactured to conduct relevant flotation experiments so as to improve the separation of produced water from asp flooding oil in water emulsions the as developed bicyclone flotation column is shown in fig 1 which includes a flotation column section a bicyclone separation section and enforced circular process section the enforced circular process section consists of a circulation pump and a microbubble generator the bicyclone structure was installed in the column dividing into upper and lower layers the bicyclone separator has two inner air injected cyclones which are provided on the middle lower part of the column with two or more tangential inlets independently the bicyclone separator includes two cylindrical cyclonic shells and two horn shaped sections fixed on the upper part of the cyclonic shell the inside of the horn shaped section forms a passage connecting the cyclone section with the column section the oily wastewater enters the column section flowing downward and the bubbles rise from the bottom of the column and continuously collide with the oil droplets the easy to separate oil droplets are effectively separated through the column flotation section and formed bubble droplets aggregates accumulate on the upper portion of the column flotation section to form a foam layer which overflows into the foam collecting tank the difficult to separate oil droplets from the bicyclone separation section will be sent to the bicyclone separator for further processing after pressurization the oily wastewater move towards the wall of the outer cylinder and are separated from the vertical flow under the action of centrifugal forces and collected on the bottom of the outer cylinder therefore circular processing is formed for the difficult to separate wastewater going from the cyclonic separation back to the cyclonic separation the oil droplets are transported from the bicyclone separation zone to the flotation column zone through the oil droplet bubble complex which is formed by the carrier role of the microbubbles and the oil water separation is subsequently finished 2 numerical model 2 1 geometrical model the commercial software solidworks was employed to structure a 3d physical model of the bicyclone flotation column as shown in fig 2 the bicyclone flotation column is a cylinder 200 mm in diameter and 1500 mm in height the tangential inlet of the upper and lower bicyclone separator is a pipe 10 mm in diameter and the outlet of the circular processing effluent from the inverted cone is a pipe 20 mm in diameter 2 2 mesh generation the commercial software ansys icem cfd was employed to generate a mesh of the bicyclone flotation column a 3d structured mesh was refined at all solid boundaries for all of the computational models used in this work as shown in fig 3 the resulting statistics of the grid graphs are shown in table 1 2 3 governing equations mass equation 1 ρ t x i ρ u i s m where sm is source item momentum equation 2 t ρ u i x i ρ u i u j p x i τ i j x j ρ g i f i where p is the static pressure τij is the stress tensor gi and fi are i direction gravity volume external and external volume forces respectively fi includes related source terms of other models the standard k ε model is employed which is the simplest turbulence model especially suitable for calculating turbulent flow in pipes turbulence equation 3 t ρ l ε l k ρ l ε l u l k ε l μ e f f l σ k k ε k g ρ l ε turbulence dissipation rate 4 t ρ

carry out the simulation the velocity inlet of the tangential inlet of the upper and lower bicyclone separator and the outlet of circular processing effluent were used in this study the upper overflow outlet of the column flotation section was adopted as the pressure outlet the boundary conditions are presented in table 2 3 numerical results and discussion 3 1 velocity distribution for bicyclone flotation column the velocity vector distribution of the bicyclone flotation column is shown in fig 4 the velocity vector distribution of the two tangential inlet representative planes in the bicyclone flotation column cyclone is shown in fig 5 it can be seen from fig 4 that the velocity direction is upward and outward near the side wall of column body where it is dominanted by centrifugal movement which can contribute to cyclonic separation of oily wastewater the velocity direction toward the center along the radial direction is downward as shown in fig 5 the tangential velocity reaches its highest value of 0 06 m of the representative plane along the radial direction the highest velocity is 0 908 m s at a height of 300 mm however the tangential velocity decreases rapidly due to the side wall effect when the radius is greater than 0 06 m along the radial direction 3 2 velocity distribution for different inlet velocity of circular processing influent fig 6 a shows the radial velocity distribution at a height of 800 mm with different inlet velocities from the circular processing influent it exhibits that the distribution of axial velocity and radial velocity are similar when the inlet velocity of the circular processing influent is between 0 5 m s and 1 0 m s the tangential velocity can reach to 0 25 m s when the inlet velocity of the circular processing influent increases from 1 0 m s to 2 0 m s as shown in fig 6 b the axial velocity is symmetrically distributed outward along the axial direction the axial velocity increases along the radial direction and reaches the maximum value of 0 11 m s when the inlet velocity of circular processing influent is 2 0 m s the influence on the flow field distribution at different tangential inlet velocity was simulated the partial velocity of the fluid increases less at different heights when the tangential inlet velocity of circular processing influent increases from 0 5 m s to 1 0 m s the tangential velocity of the fluid increases rapidly at the whole height while the inlet velocity from the circular processing influent increases from 1 0 m s to 2 0 m s when increasing the inlet velocity of circular processing influent the flow field changes from turbulent flow to steady flow the height with steady flow field is 1 1 m when the inlet velocities from the circular processing influent are 0 5 m s and 1 0 m s the height with steady flow field is above 1 2 m when the inlet velocity from the circular processing influent increases to 2 0 m s the turbulence intensity is low and unfavorable for cyclonic separation when the inlet velocity from the circular processing influent is 0 5 m s however the turbulence intensity is too high to form a static slug flow for oily wastewater separation at the upper section of the bicyclone flotation column when the inlet velocity is 2 0 m s the simulation results show that an inlet velocity of 1 0 m s from the circular processing influent is appropriate 3 3 turbulence kinetic energy and turbulence dissipation rate the turbulent dissipation rate indicates the probability of losing turbulent kinetic energy as it transforms into kinetic energy through internal fluid friction the larger the turbulent dissipation rate the greater the kinetic energy is obtained from the fluid the turbulence dissipation rate distribution curves at different heights is shown in fig 7 at the height of 300 mm and 600 mm near the tangential inlets the higher turbulence dissipation rate occurs near at the side wall of the column body where the value is 0 89 m2 s3 in the near wall region of the thinner boundary layer the viscous shearing stress plays an essential role and the turbulent shearing stress was negligible the flow in this region is similar to laminar flow the turbulent dissipation rate decreases to zero in the transitional region from the side wall to the center along the radial direction because of high vortex intensity the turbulent kinetic energy distribution is shown in fig 8 the value of turbulent kinetic energy in the column is 0 0025 m2 s2 0 0300 m2 s2 the turbulent kinetic energy is low in the region where the turbulence dissipation rate is high it can obviously be observed from the representative plane at a height of 400 mm and 800 mm in the column body that the turbulence dissipation rate is low and the maximum value of the turbulence dissipation rate is 0 38 m2 s3 as a result it can help float separation of oily wastewater because the turbulence intensity and the losing turbulent kinetic energy is low at the two representative planes the high vortex intensity and large shearing force acting on the oil droplet can contribute to cause the oil droplet to deform distort and break up while smaller shearing forces cannot produce coalescence caused by the velocity gradient however low separation efficiency may be achieved with an increase in vortex intensity and changing flow patterns in the bicyclone flotation column because high vortex intensity results in emulsification of the oil droplets in oily wastewater 4 flotation experimental by bicyclone flotation column the simulated samples of produced water from asp flooding were prepared according to the properties and components of the produced water from asp flooding in daqing oilfield china a composition of the mineralized water includes 1167 2 mg l nacl 2442 9 mg l nahco3 6 8 mg l na2so4 59 7 mg l cacl2 53 1 mg l mgcl2 6h2o the crude oil sample was obtained from daqing oilfield china an oil in water mother emulsion was prepared with the crude oil and mineralized water at a mass ratio of 1 1 and mixed at 15 000 rpm for 30 min by using an ultrahigh speed homogenizer ouhor a25 20bc a stable mother emulsion with oil concentration of 50 wt was produced the composition of chemicals for preparing simulated samples of produced water from the asp flooding with an oil concentration of 1500 mg l contained 0 300 g of mother emulsion 100 ml of mineralized water 700 mg l of naoh 300 mg l of sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate sdbs and 500 mg l of polyacrylamide the lab scale system consisted of a bicyclone flotation column a 75 l mixing tank a circulation pump a feed pump and a discharge pump the lab scale bicycolne flotation column was 50 mm in diameter and 1500 mm in height with a plexiglass cylindrical column the flotation separation of produced water from asp flooding was demulsified prior to flotation a polyether and polyquaternary ammonium ppa demulsifier was used in this work 18 the absorbance of oil was analyzed by a uv vis spectrophotometer unico uv 4802s at a wavelength of 430 nm the oil removal efficiency by the bicyclone flotation column was determined by measuring the initial and residual oil concentrations in samples the oil removal efficiency e 5 e c i c 0 c 0 100 where ci is the residual oil concentration mg l c 0 is the initial concentration of the simulated sample mg l 5 experimental results and discussion 5 1 effect of inlet velocity of circular processing influent on oil removal in the flotation process for produced water from asp flooding treatment using a bicyclone flotation column the difficult to separate produced water from asp flooding from the internal cyclone will be sent to the cyclone separator for its further processing after pressurization the experimental conditions were as follows 1252 40 mg l initial oil concentration 0 4 l min feed rate 0 5 l min gas flow rate and 50 mg l of demulsifier ppa the inlet velocity of the circular processing influent was varied from 0 5 m s to 2 0 m s the results are shown in fig 9 fig 9 represents the effect of inlet velocity for the circular processing influent on oil removal the oil removal was found to increase with an increase in the inlet velocity of the circular processing influent increasing the inlet velocity for the circular processing influent will lead to a strengthening of the cyclone field and there will be higher oil removal however low oil removal and high operational cost may be seen with an increase in the inlet velocity for the circular processing influent because of the increased turbulence intensity 96 38 oil removal was obtained when the inlet velocity of circular processing influent was 1 0 m s the numerical simulation results are verified by the experimental results and it shows that the simulation results are in agreement with the experimental results the improvement of the inlet velocity can effectively promote the turbulent kinetic energies of the fluid and the collision efficiency of oil droplets and accelerate the oil removal the strong shearing force of the fluid will promote the break up of oil droplets and result in the decrease of oil removal while the turbulent kinetic energies are too strong 5 2 effect of feed rate on oil removal the feed rate plays an important role for the column device the feed rate not only determines the oil removal efficiencies but also affects the operational cost the experimental conditions were as follows 1252 40 mg l initial oil concentration 1 0 m s inlet velocity for the circular processing influent 0 75 l min gas flow rate and 50 mg l of demulsifier ppa the feed rate varied from 0 1 l min to 0 5 l min the results are shown in fig 10 fig 10 shows the effect of feed rate on the oil removal where increasing the feed rate will decrease the oil removal the residence time is determined by the feed rate in the bicyclone flotation column decreasing the feed rate will increase the residence time and improve oil removal 99 18 oil removal was obtained when the feed rate was 0 3 l min 5 3 a field experiment by bicyclone flotation column the field experiments were carried out at daqing oilfield production plant china the produced water from asp flooding flowed into a mixing tank from a settling tank under gravity and then mixed with the added demulsifier ppa by reagent pump the produced water from asp flooding after being demulsified was fed into the bicyclone flotation column through the feed pump effluent from the bottom of column was sent to a sewage pipeline through the discharged pump and the oil carried foam overflows from the top of the foam discharge tank the main components of the dissolved air flotation daf column include a flotation column a saturation tank an air compressor and an air sparger both flotation columns were 50 mm in diameter and 1500 mm in height with a stainless steel cylindrical column the experimental conditions were as follows 462 50 mg l initial oil concentration 0 3 l min feed rate 1 0 m s inlet velocity for the circular processing influent 0 75 l min gas flow rate and 50 mg l of demulsifier ppa the results are shown in fig 11 the field experiments were conducted for 3 h as shown in fig 11 the results show a treated effluent with final oil concentrations of 45 21 mg l 43 16 mg l 46 05 mg l 40 54 mg l 42 85 mg l and 41 07 mg l using bicyclone flotation column which can meet the oil concentration requirement of below 50 mg l however the final oil concentrations in treated effluent using dissolved air flotation column are varied form 62 78 mg l to 76 28 mg l fig 12 shows the size distribution analysis of the samples of treated effluent from the bicyclone flotation column and daf device for the bicyclone flotation column the size d 10 d 50 and d 90 of the oil droplets in effluent are 1 721 μm 3 97 μm and 37 78 μm respectively this means that the bicyclone flotation column is especially effective for separating fine oil droplets from the produced water from asp flooding for the daf device the size d 10 d 50 and d 90 of the oil droplets in effluent are 2 017 μm 7 21 μm and 44 59 μm respectively this means that the daf device cannot effectively separate the fine oil droplets from the produced water from asp flooding 6 conclusions in order to improve the separation efficiency of oil in water emulsion with fine oil droplets a novel bicyclone flotation column that combined a flotation column and a cyclone was developed and applied for the treatment of produced water from asp flooding the aim is to strengthen the flotation separation of fine oil droplets in oil water emulsions the velocity vector distribution the turbulence kinetic energy and the turbulence dissipation rate in the bicyclone flotation column were used to quantify the probability of collision and attachment to validate the flotation separation performance of bicyclone flotation column lab scale and field experiments for treating produced water from asp flooding were carried out the main conclusions are as follows 1 the effect of the bicyclone structure on velocity vector distribution the turbulence kinetic energy and the turbulence dissipation rate in bicyclone flotation column is verified 2 the treated effluent oil concentrations can meet the requirement of below 50 mg l for the bicyclone flotation column and daf device the oil droplet size d 50 in the effluent is 3 97 μm and 7 21 μm respectively acknowledgements the authors are grateful to the national natural science foundation of china no 51674261 the

radial velocity distribution at a height of 800 mm with different inlet velocities from the circular processing influent it exhibits that the distribution of axial velocity and radial velocity are similar when the inlet velocity of the circular processing influent is between 0 5 m s and 1 0 m s the tangential velocity can reach to 0 25 m s when the inlet velocity of the circular processing

and reaches the maximum value of 0 11 m s when the inlet velocity of circular processing influent is 2 0 m s the influence on the flow field distribution at different tangential inlet velocity was simulated the partial velocity of the fluid increases less at different heights when the tangential inlet velocity of circular processing influent increases from 0 5 m s to 1 0 m s the tangential

is 0 89 m2 s3 in the near wall region of the thinner boundary layer the viscous shearing stress plays an essential role and the turbulent shearing stress was negligible the flow in this region is similar to laminar flow the turbulent dissipation rate decreases to zero in the transitional region from the side wall to the center along the radial direction because of high vortex intensity the turbulent kinetic energy distribution is shown in fig 8 the value of turbulent kinetic energy in the column is 0 0025 m2 s2 0 0300 m2 s2 the turbulent kinetic energy is low in the region where the turbulence dissipation rate is high it can obviously be observed from the representative plane at a height of 400 mm and 800 mm in the column body that the turbulence dissipation rate is low and the maximum value of the turbulence dissipation rate is 0 38 m2 s3 as a result it can help float separation of oily wastewater because the turbulence intensity and the losing turbulent kinetic energy is low at the two representative planes the high vortex intensity and large shearing force acting on the oil droplet can contribute to cause the oil droplet to deform distort and break up while smaller shearing forces cannot produce coalescence caused by the velocity gradient however low separation efficiency may be achieved with an increase in vortex intensity and changing flow patterns in the bicyclone flotation column because high vortex intensity results in emulsification of the oil droplets in oily wastewater 4 flotation experimental by bicyclone flotation column the simulated samples of produced water from asp flooding were prepared according to the properties and components of the produced water from asp flooding in daqing oilfield china a composition of the mineralized water includes 1167 2 mg l nacl 2442 9 mg l nahco3 6 8 mg l na2so4 59 7 mg l cacl2 53 1 mg l mgcl2 6h2o the crude oil sample was obtained from daqing oilfield china an oil in water mother emulsion was prepared with the crude oil and mineralized water at a mass ratio of 1 1 and mixed at 15 000 rpm for 30 min by using an ultrahigh speed homogenizer ouhor a25 20bc a stable mother emulsion with oil concentration of 50 wt was produced the composition of chemicals for preparing simulated samples of produced water from the asp flooding with an oil concentration of 1500 mg l contained 0 300 g of mother emulsion 100 ml of mineralized water 700 mg l of naoh 300 mg l of sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate sdbs and 500 mg l of polyacrylamide the lab scale system consisted of a bicyclone flotation column a 75 l mixing tank a circulation pump a feed pump and a discharge pump the lab scale bicycolne flotation column was 50 mm in diameter and 1500 mm in height with a plexiglass cylindrical column the flotation separation of produced water from asp flooding was demulsified prior to flotation a polyether and polyquaternary ammonium ppa demulsifier was used in this work 18 the absorbance of oil was analyzed by a uv vis spectrophotometer unico uv 4802s at a wavelength of 430 nm the oil removal efficiency by the bicyclone flotation column was determined by measuring the initial and residual oil concentrations in samples the oil removal efficiency e 5 e c i c 0 c 0 100 where ci is the residual oil concentration mg l c 0 is the initial concentration of the simulated sample mg l 5 experimental results and discussion 5 1 effect of inlet velocity of circular processing influent on oil removal in the flotation process for produced water from asp flooding treatment using a bicyclone flotation column the difficult to separate produced water from asp flooding from the internal cyclone will be sent to the cyclone separator for its further processing after pressurization the experimental conditions were as follows 1252 40 mg l initial oil concentration 0 4 l min feed rate 0 5 l min gas flow rate and 50 mg l of demulsifier ppa the inlet velocity of the circular processing influent was varied from 0 5 m s to 2 0 m s the results are shown in fig 9 fig 9 represents the effect of inlet velocity for the circular processing influent on oil removal the oil removal was found to increase with an increase in the inlet velocity of the circular processing influent increasing the inlet velocity for the circular processing influent will lead to a strengthening of the cyclone field and there will be higher oil removal however low oil removal and high operational cost may be seen with an increase in the inlet velocity for the circular processing influent because of the increased turbulence intensity 96 38 oil removal was obtained when the inlet velocity of circular processing influent was 1 0 m s the numerical simulation results are verified by the experimental results and it shows that the simulation results are in agreement with the experimental results the improvement of the inlet velocity can effectively promote the turbulent kinetic energies of the fluid and the collision efficiency of oil droplets and accelerate the oil removal the strong shearing force of the fluid will promote the break up of oil droplets and result in the decrease of oil removal while the turbulent kinetic energies are too strong 5 2 effect of feed rate on oil removal the feed rate plays an important role for the column device the feed rate not only determines the oil removal efficiencies but also affects the operational cost the experimental conditions were as follows 1252 40 mg l initial oil concentration 1 0 m s inlet velocity for the circular processing influent 0 75 l min gas flow rate and 50 mg l of demulsifier ppa the feed rate varied from 0 1 l min to 0 5 l min the results are shown in fig 10 fig 10 shows the effect of feed rate on the oil removal where increasing the feed rate will decrease the oil removal the residence time is determined by the feed rate in the bicyclone flotation column decreasing the feed rate will increase the residence time and improve oil removal 99 18 oil removal was obtained when the feed rate was 0 3 l min 5 3 a field experiment by bicyclone flotation column the field experiments were carried out at daqing oilfield production plant china the produced water from asp flooding flowed into a mixing tank from a settling tank under gravity and then mixed with the added demulsifier ppa by reagent pump the produced water from asp flooding after being demulsified was fed into the bicyclone flotation column through the feed pump effluent from the bottom of column was sent to a sewage pipeline through the discharged pump and the oil carried foam overflows from the top of the foam discharge tank the main components of the dissolved air flotation daf column include a flotation column a saturation tank an air compressor and an air sparger both flotation columns were 50 mm in diameter and 1500 mm in height with a stainless steel cylindrical column the experimental conditions were as follows 462 50 mg l initial oil concentration 0 3 l min feed rate 1 0 m s inlet velocity for the circular processing influent 0 75 l min gas flow rate and 50 mg l of demulsifier ppa the results are shown in fig 11 the field experiments were conducted for 3 h as shown in fig 11 the results show a treated effluent with final oil concentrations of 45 21 mg l 43 16 mg l 46 05 mg l 40 54 mg l 42 85 mg l and 41 07 mg l using bicyclone flotation column which can meet the oil concentration requirement of below 50 mg l however the final oil concentrations in treated effluent using dissolved air flotation column are varied form 62 78 mg l to 76 28 mg l fig 12 shows the size distribution analysis of the samples of treated effluent from the bicyclone flotation column and daf device for the bicyclone flotation column the size d 10 d 50 and d 90 of the oil droplets in effluent are 1 721 μm 3 97 μm and 37 78 μm respectively this means that the bicyclone flotation column is especially effective for separating fine oil droplets from the produced water from asp flooding for the daf device the size d 10 d 50 and d 90 of the oil droplets in effluent are 2 017 μm 7 21 μm and 44 59 μm respectively this means that the daf device cannot effectively separate the fine oil droplets from the produced water from asp flooding 6 conclusions in order to improve the separation efficiency of oil in water emulsion with fine oil droplets a novel bicyclone flotation column that combined a flotation column and a cyclone was developed and applied for the treatment of produced water from asp flooding the aim is to strengthen the flotation separation of fine oil droplets in oil water emulsions the velocity vector distribution the turbulence kinetic energy and the turbulence dissipation rate in the bicyclone flotation column were used to quantify the probability of collision and attachment to validate the flotation separation performance of bicyclone flotation column lab scale and field experiments for treating produced water from asp flooding were carried out the main conclusions are as follows 1 the effect of the bicyclone structure on velocity vector distribution the turbulence kinetic energy and the turbulence dissipation rate in bicyclone flotation column is verified 2 the treated effluent oil concentrations can meet the requirement of below 50 mg l for the bicyclone flotation column and daf device the oil droplet size d 50 in the effluent is 3 97 μm and 7 21 μm respectively acknowledgements the authors are grateful to the national natural science foundation of china no 51674261 the

14296,the aim was to evaluate the effect of three different dissolved oxygen concentration do on membrane fouling and foulants production as well as in the removal of nitrogen and organic matter by simultaneous nitrification and denatrification snd for this purpose a smbr pilot plant was operated with continuous flow and no separated anoxic zone experiments were carried out in three phases i e phase i ii and iii with do 2 0 0 8 and 0 4 mg l respectively under these conditions a good performance in terms of cod and bod5 20 was obtained removals higher than 96 and 97 respectively the nitrification was almost complete even when the dissolved oxygen concentration was the lowest phase iii the reduction of do concentration positively impacted the total nitrogen removal through snd especially in phase ii resulting in an average total nitrogen removal of 66 while in phase i the average removal was only 28 sludge filterability membrane performance and total resistance of mixed liquor under snd conditions when the do was 0 8 0 1 mgo2 l were not significantly affected conversely a significant change was observed when the do concentration was reduced to 0 4 mg 0 1 mg o2 l keywords nitrogen removal dissolved oxygen extracellular polymeric substances fouling 1 introduction populations are rapidly growing and by 2050 over 6 4 billion people are expected to be living in urban areas meanwhile 40 of the world s population will be affected by water scarcity 1 in this context innovative water recovery and reuse technology solutions can offer appropriate options to make cities resilient to droughts and to the challenges resulting from a water scarcity scenario among the large number of wastewater treatment technologies developed during the past decades submerged membrane bioreactor smbr arose as one of the most promising and innovative this technology which combines biological and membrane process mainly micro and ultrafiltration mf and uf has become a reliable and efficient option for wastewater treatment capable of producing a high quality effluent with low land requirement which are relevant characteristics for developing water reclamation and reuse schemes in urban areas 2 4 despite the intrinsic advantages of mbr technology its application is still compromised by energy requirement for the aeration system aeration is not only used for the membrane physical cleaning but also for the biological process which is significantly higher because of the high suspended solids concentration higher suspended solids concentration results in lower oxygen transfer efficiency increasing the power consumption of the aeration unit which can represent approximately 17 25 of the operational costs of a smbr system 5 therefore the reduction of aeration needs is still one of the focus of the actions toward energy saving in the smbr in addition the conventional solution to nitrogen removal in smbr which includes two separated reactors one for nitrification and onother one for denitrification requires the sludge recirculation from the aerobic reactor to the anoxic with a flow at least 3 times the feed flow in addition to the high oxygen consumption to complete ammonium nitrification to overcome these problems simultaneous nitrification and denitrification process snd has been identified as the most promising option in this configuration nitrogen removal occurs simultaneously in the aerated reactor eliminating the need for a separated anoxic compartment 6 7 the microenvironment theory states that it will have a dissolved oxygen do concentration gradient inside the flocs or microbial biofilms due to diffusional limitations which is the main hypothesis for the occurrence of snd 8 10 this condition will result in different microorganism populations with the nitrifying ones located in high do concentration regions and the denitrifying ones located in lower do concentration regions 11 12 furthermore other mechanisms such as heterotrophic nitrification 13 aerobic denitrification 14 and short cut nitrification denitrification 15 16 will also contribute to nitrogen removal through snd processes in this context snd for nitrogen removal has several advantages when compared with conventional nitrification and denitrification in two separated reactors 17 20 i the denitrification process is extended over the entire reactor volume ii no internal oxidized nitrogen recirculation are needed iii oxygen consumption is significantly reduced because nitrate can be used as the alternate electron acceptor in both microbial growth and decay processes and denitrification through nitrite would require less organic carbon since the oxygen equivalent of nitrite is 33 smaller than the oxygen equivalent of nitrate although several operating parameters such as sludge retention time srt hydraulic retention time hrt and food to microorganism ratio f m can contribute to snd processes 21 the control of do concentration to keep low levels in the mixed liquor is the key parameter for the development and stability of this process the possibility of a smbr to operate with a high biomass concentration will result in lower oxygen transfer efficiency and even with smaller flocs due to the strong turbulence in membrane tanks a limiting factor for snd some studies indicate that the smbr can readily achieve 60 80 of nitrogen removal by snd 22 hocaoglu et al 18 evaluated the effect of three low dissolved oxygen levels below 0 5 mg l on snd in a mbr sbr membrane bioreactor sequencing batch reactor treating black water they found nitrogen removal remained optimal within the do concentration in the range of 0 15 0 35 mg l 70 73 of total nitrogen removal but nitrification was incomplete due to adverse effects of low do level the same authors reported that the total nitrogen removal decreased to 36 when do was increased to 0 50 0 55 considering low do concentrations represent an important aspect in the control of snd its variation can modify the activated sludge properties and composition reducing the do concentrations below 1 0 mg l does not appear to be an adequate option for operating a conventional activated sludge treatment system as it favors filamentous growth and impairs the sludge settleability and therefore the system stability and performance 23 also especially for smbr systems it is suggested that sludge filterability characteristics will be deteriorated at low do concentrations increasing membrane fouling phenomena 24 25 arabi and nakhla 26 performed experiments using a conventional smbr and a snd mbr operated at do concentrations of 3 0 4 0 mg l and 1 0 1 2 mg l respectively in their study higher membrane fouling rates were observed in the snd mbr as well as higher modified fouling index mfi due to the increased concentrations of soluble microbial products smp and extracelullar polymeric substance eps likewise paetkau and cicek 27 investigated the sludge characteristics and nitrogen removal in a snd mbr and observed that the system operated with higher tmp values greater fouling rates and higher soluble cod and teps transparent exopolymer substances values associated with the snd mbr however in both studies the snd process and the membrane fouling were evaluated at only one level of do concentration and no strict control of dissolved oxygen has been performed it is worth to note that in the paetkau and cicek 27 investigation the air flow for membrane scouring was different for the conventional mbr continuous aeration with air flow of 4 l min and snd mbr intermittent aeration with air flow of 8 l min 15 s of aeration followed by five minutes of no aeration in this condition it is difficult to explain the effect of do on membrane fouling rates tmp values and which do concentration was suitable for the snd process in smbr in addition ji and zhou 28 presented contradictory results on the detrimental impact of low do level on membrane fouling they found that total soluble eps protein and carbohydrate decreased from 23 9 12 2 μg ml at do of 3 4 mg l to 13 0 6 2 μg ml at do of 0 9 mg l which cannot justify the increase of fouling rate at low do concentrations despite the consensus that higher do concentrations lead to better sludge filterability and lower fouling rate the literature is controversial regarding which level of do will affect the eps production and sludge filterability while some studies indicated higher eps concentration and poor sludge filterability at low do concentration others observed lower eps production at low do concentrations therefore the effective approach for changing the operational parameters of an activated sludge system and their influence on sludge characteristics is still an important aspect in smbr when operated at snd condition the major challenge of this process configuration in smbr is not only to find out the best condition for nitrogen removal but also to avoid or to reduce the membrane fouling problem at a low oxygen concentration improving the overall system performance however little information is currently available on the eps production in smbr systems with snd process at different do concentrations particularly in a single stage and continuous flow system in this context our study aimed to evaluate the performance of the snd process using a smbr pilot plant operated with three different do and the effect of this operational parameter on the membrane productivity 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental set up and procedure this study was carried out at the international reference center on water reuse icwr usp using a smbr with a reactor volume of 156 l equipped with an automatic data acquisition system and the necessary instruments for measuring and registering at each 20 s permeate flow and temperature transmembrane pressure tmp oxidation reduction potential orp do concentration and ph fig 1 flat sheet ultrafiltration membrane modules fs uf fabricated in polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf with a mean pore size of 0 1 microns from sinap were used for solid separation the total membrane area was 1 8 m² 18 plates the permeate was continuously withdrawn by a peristaltic pump operating with a cycle of 9 min of filtration and 2 min of relaxation the pilot plant was maintained under ambient temperature during the study period 221 days and was continuously fed with domestic wastewater arising from the student housing and restaurant of the university of são paulo prior to the smbr system wastewater passed through a mechanical screening step screen and a grit chamber fig 1 during the experiment sludge was periodically removed from the reactor to control the mlss concentration resulting in an average srt of 41 days to provide the specific process conditions the smbr system was operated with one fine bubble diffuser for the mixed liquor intermittent aeration and one coarse bubble diffuser for the membranes system continuous aeration 15 l air min the dissolved oxygen concentration was monitored using a luminescent dissolved oxygen probe connected to a controller ds net policontrol this controller based on the concentration of the do concentration measured by the probe operated an electrically actuated valve solenoid installed in the mixed liquor aeration line thus when the dissolved oxygen concentration was below the set point the controller activated the solenoid valve that supplied air to the reactor by the complementary system raising the od concentration to the configured maximum value closing the solenoid valve to achieve the snd conditions and to evaluate the influence of the do concentration in snd and fouling processes three operational conditions were established based on the do concentration phases i to iii phase i 0 56 days was considered the control phase representing the operation performance of a conventional treatment system with an average do concentration of 2 0 mg o2 l 1 while phases ii 57 152 days and iii 153 209 days operated with an average do concentration of 0 8 and 0 4 mg o2 l 1 respectively representing the operation under snd condition 2 2 fouling analyses and foulants characterization during the system operation the mixed liquor was monitored to identify a possible correlation of its characteristics with the reduction of membrane performance under different do concentrations the sludge filterability was evaluated by the time to filter ttf procedure according the method 2710h 29 the ttf results were normalized for the mlss concentration resulting in ttf index s g mlss the fouling propensity caused by the mixed liquor composition which contains soluble and colloidal substances as well as suspended solids was evaluated according to the methodology described by judd 30 expressed by eq 1 1 r l a r s s r c o l r s o l where r l a is the hydraulic resistance of the sludge r s s the hydraulic resistance associated with suspended solids r c o l the resistance related to colloids and r s o l the resistance from soluble compounds the fractionation methodology was applied to estimate each resistance from activated sludge biomass a portion of the mixed liquor was centrifuged resulting in a supernatant whose resistance was evaluated using a stirred cell r s u p another portion of this supernatant was then filtered using a 0 45 μm membrane and the filtrate was used to estimate the r s o l thus the difference between r s u p and r s o l was attributed to colloidal particles r c o l the hydraulic resistance from each sludge fraction was evaluated using a filtration cell from millipore model amicon 8400 in which the effect of the gel layer formation is minimized by the magnetic stirrer during the tests the pressure was maintained constant at 0 2 bar the fractions of soluble and bound extracellular polymeric substance eps were determined by applying an extraction procedure adapted from the extraction methodology proposed by morgan et al 31 as described by judd 30 following the extraction the samples were analyzed for protein 32 and carbohydrates 33 2 3 biomass activity and nitrogen conversion process the microbial activity associated with heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria were performed by respirometry tests with mixed liquor samples from the reactor for all the tests a beluga s32c model respirometer was used 34 in this experiment the consumption of added substrate is translated by the consumption of do registered by the respirometer which defines the oxygen uptake rate our taking the our and dividing its value by the mlssv the specific oxygen uptake rate sour mg o2 g mlssv h is obtained the substrates used for the bacterial groups of interest in this study heterotrophic sourh and autotrophic nitrifying bacteria sourn were sodium acetate and ammonium chloride respectively the amount of nitrogen removed via snd was estimated by a mass balance of the nitrogenous material according to eqs 2 4

results and discussion 3 1 influence of do concentration on organic matter removal activity of heterotrophic biomass and sludge settling fig 2 and table 1 present the variation of cod and bod5 20 concentration in the permeate and its removal efficiencies obtained for the three operational phases throughout the experimental period treated effluent cod and bod5 20 was minimum in phase i when the dissolved oxygen was kept at 2 1 mg l 1 resulting in averages concentrations of 22 8 0 mg cod l 1 and 6 6 2 3 mg bod5 20 l 1 compared to phase ii and iii despite the lower values of cod and bod5 20 obtained in phase i no significant statistical difference was observed among the results of the three phases p value of 0 112 and 0 475 for bod5 20 and cod respectively during the whole experimental period regardless of the do concentration variation the average cod and bod5 20 removal efficiencies were more than 96 and 97 respectively results indicated that a reduction in do in the mixed liquor did not significantly affect cod and bod5 20 removal efficiencies fig 4 although the organic matter removal has not been affected by the reduction of do concentration the activity of the heterotrophic biomass was significantly reduced the respirometric activity of heterotrophic bacteria quantified by sourh decreased from 21 7 0 6 mg o2 g ssv h in phase i to 13 3 0 9 mg o2 g ssv h and 13 9 1 3 mg o2 g ssv h in phases ii and iii respectively however even with the reduction of the sourh values observed in phase ii and iii they are higher than the ones reported by ng et al 36 from 12 0 mg o2 g ssv h to 5 0 mg o2 g ssv h it has been suggested that a very low do concentration is necessary to affect the efficiency of organic matter removal because of the very low heterotrophic oxygen half saturation coefficient ko h lau et al 37 describing the growth kinetics of a floc former citrobacter sp and a filament sphaerotilis natans obtained ko h values of 0 15 and 0 01 mg l respectively it is not surprising that several researchers have found that the do concentration has little effect on carbon removal efficiency 38 39 as it was verified in this study however the do concentration might influence the competition between filamentous and floc forming bacteria and negatively impacted the sludge settling characteristics the results indicated a deterioration in the sludge settling properties expressed by the sludge volume index svi table 1 with an increase from phase i 162 55 ml g 1 to phase ii 266 33 ml g 1 and phase iii 272 36 ml g 1 although svi is not a concern in terms of effluent quality in a smbr system fouling tends to increase when the filamentous microorganisms are present in the floc structure impacting the membrane performance 40 41 3 2 influence of do concentration on the nitrogen conversion process the efficiencies obtained for the nitrogen removal by the smbr system are presented in table 2 it is possible to verify that the ammonia nitrogen concentrations in the permeate were low with average concentrations below 2 0 mg n nh4 l 1 even for the do concentrations of 0 8 0 1 mg o2 l 1 and 0 4 0 1 mg o2 l 1 in phases ii and iii respectively the highest concentrations of n ammoniacal were found in phase iii when the oxygen concentration was reduced to 0 4 mg o2 l 1 and may be associated with the reduction of the sournit which decreased from 7 2 0 7 mg o2 g mlvss h to 5 1 0 7 mg o2 g mlvss h in phase i to phase iii respectively even though the lower ammonia nitrogen concentration 0 87 mg n nh4 l 1 was obtained during phase i operation the statistical analysis did not indicate different values for the three phases p value 0 227 the nitrate concentration in the effluent close to the influent ammonia concentration on a nitrogen basis for do concentrations of 0 8 and 0 4 mg o2 l 1 indicates that complete nitrification consistently took place in snd condition a similar behavior was observed for tkn which is also associated with nitrification efficiency assuming the nitrogen incorporation into the biomass was the same for the three experiment phases no difference among the three operational phases over the observation period was verified the information about the impact of do concentration on the nitrification process in the literature is quite diverse but it has been demonstrated that almost complete nitrification could be achieved with do concentrations below 0 5 mg o2 l 1 however a higher concentration of nitrifying biomass is necessary meaning that a longer srt and lower organic load should be kept in the system 42 44 this is in accordance with the results from the experiments developed in addition based on the experimental evidence fitzgerald et al 45 suggested that ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob in nitrosomonas genus for example pseudomonas xanthomonadaceae rhodococcus and sphingomonas are responsible for low do nitrification in the case of a smbr system despite the presence of low do nitrification bacteria the presence of biological flocs with reduced dimensions resulted from the stress action produced by the intense membrane aeration favoring the do transfer through these biological flocs this condition increases the aerobic microzone which in its turn increases the oxygen supply for the nitrifying bacteria differently from the results for the organic matter and ammonia which showed no significant statistical differences in the removal rates the dissolved oxygen concentration played an important role in the total nitrogen tn removal efficiency fig 3 depicts the behavior of the total nitrogen concentration according to the change in the do concentration the level of nitrogen removal was consistently higher in phase ii 66 11 and phase iii 50 7 than observed in phase i 28 13 resulting in an average total nitrogen effluent concentration of 21 2 5 4 mg n l 1 31 6 5 6 mg n l 1and 45 1 8 4 mg n l 1 respectively he et al 46 who evaluated the f m ratio of nitrogen removal using the snd process indicated that higher denitrification efficiencies can be obtained with higher f m ratios these authors obtained a total nitrogen removal efficiency close to 86 using a do concentration of 0 8 mg o2 l 1 and a f m ratio of 0 423 kg cod kg mlss 1 d 1 however when the f m ratio was reduced to 0 272 g cod kg mlss 1 d 1 close to the value of our study 0 25 0 019 kg cod kg mlss 1 d 1 the total nitrogen removal efficiency was reduced to about close 70 in addition to nitrate the effluent nitrite concentration was also monitored during the three experiment phases the results showed a slight increase in the nitrite concentration when the do concentration was reduced reaching the maximum average value of 2 0 0 25 mg no2 n l 1 in the effluent of phase iii 0 4 0 1 mg o2 l yet in phase i in do concentration and orp of 2 1 0 2 mg o2 l and 237 73 mv respectively the presence of nitrite in the effluent was detected only once while in phase ii the nitrite was detected in the effluent only 3 times it is well known that the extent of the denitrification process largely depends on the carbon source quality and quantity which could also affect the level of denitrification intermediates such as nitrite and nitrous oxide n2o previous research indicated that nitrite accumulation can occur during the denitrification process if the available carbon content is not sufficient for reducing nitrate to nitrogen gas and also the formation of no2g can be observed mainly when a concentration of about 5 mg l 1 of no2l n is reached 47 48 therefore the nitrite results suggest that there was a limitation of organic matter during the phase iii which could be contributed to the low denitrification levels observed in this phase compared with the results of phase ii the occurrence of nitrification and denitrification process and the behavior observed during each operation phase can be confirmed by the variation in the alkalinity concentration δalk presented in table 2 as observed in table 2 the δalk for operational phases ii and iii were smaller than the δalk for phase i and the lowest variation in alkalinity concentration occurred during phase ii operation because during the denitrification process the alkalinity is recovered nitrogen compounds mass balance demonstrated an increase of the denitrification process with the reduction of the do concentration during phase i operation the average total nitrogen removal was 28 from which 87 were eliminated through assimilation by the biomass and 13 removed by denitrification while during phase ii operation the average total nitrogen removal reached 66 from which 37 were assimilated by the biomass and 63 were removed by denitrification for phase iii the total nitrogen average removal was smaller compared to the one obtained during phase ii but an increase in the fraction removed by denitrification was also observed similar results table 3 were obtained by arabi and nakhla 26 paetkau and cicek 27 which indicates that the snd process can be an alternative for the traditional nitrification denitrification arrangement 3 3 influence of do on sludge filterability membrane performance and foulants production the sludge quality can be indirectly estimated by measuring its dewatering capacity through a filter in this study the ttf method was chosen to evaluate the activated sludge filterability the obtained results confirmed that the do concentration plays an important role in sludge filterability since the ttf increases as the do concentration is reduced fig 5 a the worst conditions occurred during phase iii operation in which the average ttf reached 780 349 s almost seven times higher the value obtained for phase i operation ttf of 112 35 s and three times higher the value for phase ii operation ttf of 236 137 s although the mean ttf results from phase ii were higher than those from phase i the difference was not statistically significant p value 0 5345 but greater variations could be observed in the quality of the filterability of the mixed liquor in phase ii than in phase i which may be associated to the biomass stress at critical do concentration nevertheless regardless of the do level the average ttf was higher than 100 s indicating a sludge of medium quality sludges with ttf measurements greater than 300 s as obtained in phase iii are considered of low or bad quality 49 the sludge of medium quality filterability obtained with the average do concentration of 2 1 0 2 could be associated with the wastewater characteristics since there is a contribution from the university restaurant effluent which has higher organic and o g loads compared to domestic effluents the changes in the do from phase i 2 1 mg l to phase ii 0 8 mg l did not significantly affect the membrane performance fig 4 since the tmp profile are quite similar between both phases however the reduction of the do concentration to 0 40 mg l phase iii had a significant impact on the membrane performance the fouling was very rapid when compared with that of the previous phases i and ii with an stimated fouling rate 4 times hiher than phase i the fouling propensity results as well as the filterability and membrane performance results indicate that there was no significant change in the total resistance of the mixed liquor rla between phases i and ii but a substantial increase in phase iii was observed fig 5b in addition the reduction of do concentration promoted a change in the fouling propensity associated with the different fractions of the mixed liquor the results showed that there was a significant increase in the contribution of the fraction associated with the suspended solids and a reduction of the resistance by the soluble fraction which refers to the mixed liquor previously filtered in an acetate cellulose membrane of 0 45 μm to identify the groups of foulants associated with membrane fouling in each operation phase measures of soluble and bound eps as carbohydrate and protein were performed as shown in fig 6 among the eps fractions the highest eps increases were observed in soluble protein and bound carbohydrate an average increase of 89 was observed from phase i 1 2 0 3 mg g mlss to phase ii 2 2 0 5 mg g mlss in eps as bound carbohydrate when the do concentration was reduced to 0 40 mg l the bound eps as carbohydrate reached 3 5 0 5 mg g mlss which represents an average increase of 195 as compared to phase i the same behavior was observed for eps as soluble protein with a significant increase from phase i 2 6 0 6 mg g mlss to phases ii and iii 6 3 1 9 mg g mlss and 6 1 1 6 mg g mlss furthermore the reduction of do concentration promoted an increase in total soluble eps protein carbohydrate from 4 1 to 8 1 and 8 0 mg g mlss in phases i ii and iii respectively low do concentrations has been reported to reduce the cell hydrophobicity and thus cause floc deterioration which can increase smp concentrations 26 50 this can explain the higher soluble eps concentrations in phases ii and iii when compared with phase i despite the difficulty in correlating eps component protein and carbohydrate to fouling parameter due to differences in the available experimental methods for eps content assessment and to the different configuration of smbr treatment plants many authors pointed out that polysaccharides are the major component of biopolymers 100 kg mol 1 which have been deemed the key fouling causing substances during low pressure membrane filtration 51 52 okamura et al 53 showed linear correlation of the bound eps as carbohydrate concentration with the filtration resistance in which greater values of resistance were associated to greater bound eps as carbohydrate concentrations these findings can explain the deterioration of sludge filterability as well as the higher rss observed in phase iii which can be a result of the increase of bound eps as carbohydrate and a consequence of an oxygen stressed environment 4 conclusions this study evaluated the influence in the overall performance of a membrane bioreactor operated under three different levels of dissolved oxygen the outcomes suggest that membrane bioreactors can conveniently be operated in snd condition at 0 8 mg o2 l 1 reaching more than 60 of total nitrogen removal with no formal anoxic zone without significant drawbacks in terms of sludge filterability and fouling propensity furthermore in order to improve total nitrogen removal the mbr system could be operated with a higher f m ratio which can improve the denitrification condition on the other hand decreasing the do level below 0 8 mg o2 l 1 does not result in an additional increase in nitrogen removal and appeared less suitable especially from the

14296,the aim was to evaluate the effect of three different dissolved oxygen concentration do on membrane fouling and foulants production as well as in the removal of nitrogen and organic matter by simultaneous nitrification and denatrification snd for this purpose a smbr pilot plant was operated with continuous flow and no separated anoxic zone experiments were carried out in three phases i e phase i ii and iii with do 2 0 0 8 and 0 4 mg l respectively under these conditions a good performance in terms of cod and bod5 20 was obtained removals higher than 96 and 97 respectively the nitrification was almost complete even when the dissolved oxygen concentration was the lowest phase iii the reduction of do concentration positively impacted the total nitrogen removal through snd especially in phase ii resulting in an average total nitrogen removal of 66 while in phase i the average removal was only 28 sludge filterability membrane performance and total resistance of mixed liquor under snd conditions when the do was 0 8 0 1 mgo2 l were not significantly affected conversely a significant change was observed when the do concentration was reduced to 0 4 mg 0 1 mg o2 l keywords nitrogen removal dissolved oxygen extracellular polymeric substances fouling 1 introduction populations are rapidly growing and by 2050 over 6 4 billion people are expected to be living in urban areas meanwhile 40 of the world s population will be affected by water scarcity 1 in this context innovative water recovery and reuse technology solutions can offer appropriate options to make cities resilient to droughts and to the challenges resulting from a water scarcity scenario among the large number of wastewater treatment technologies developed during the past decades submerged membrane bioreactor smbr arose as one of the most promising and innovative this technology which combines biological and membrane process mainly micro and ultrafiltration mf and uf has become a reliable and efficient option for wastewater treatment capable of producing a high quality effluent with low land requirement which are relevant characteristics for developing water reclamation and reuse schemes in urban areas 2 4 despite the intrinsic advantages of mbr technology its application is still compromised by energy requirement for the aeration system aeration is not only used for the membrane physical cleaning but also for the biological process which is significantly higher because of the high suspended solids concentration higher suspended solids concentration results in lower oxygen transfer efficiency increasing the power consumption of the aeration unit which can represent approximately 17 25 of the operational costs of a smbr system 5 therefore the reduction of aeration needs is still one of the focus of the actions toward energy saving in the smbr in addition the conventional solution to nitrogen removal in smbr which includes two separated reactors one for nitrification and onother one for denitrification requires the sludge recirculation from the aerobic reactor to the anoxic with a flow at least 3 times the feed flow in addition to the high oxygen consumption to complete ammonium nitrification to overcome these problems simultaneous nitrification and denitrification process snd has been identified as the most promising option in this configuration nitrogen removal occurs simultaneously in the aerated reactor eliminating the need for a separated anoxic compartment 6 7 the microenvironment theory states that it will have a dissolved oxygen do concentration gradient inside the flocs or microbial biofilms due to diffusional limitations which is the main hypothesis for the occurrence of snd 8 10 this condition will result in different microorganism populations with the nitrifying ones located in high do concentration regions and the denitrifying ones located in lower do concentration regions 11 12 furthermore other mechanisms such as heterotrophic nitrification 13 aerobic denitrification 14 and short cut nitrification denitrification 15 16 will also contribute to nitrogen removal through snd processes in this context snd for nitrogen removal has several advantages when compared with conventional nitrification and denitrification in two separated reactors 17 20 i the denitrification process is extended over the entire reactor volume ii no internal oxidized nitrogen recirculation are needed iii oxygen consumption is significantly reduced because nitrate can be used as the alternate electron acceptor in both microbial growth and decay processes and denitrification through nitrite would require less organic carbon since the oxygen equivalent of nitrite is 33 smaller than the oxygen equivalent of nitrate although several operating parameters such as sludge retention time srt hydraulic retention time hrt and food to microorganism ratio f m can contribute to snd processes 21 the control of do concentration to keep low levels in the mixed liquor is the key parameter for the development and stability of this process the possibility of a smbr to operate with a high biomass concentration will result in lower oxygen transfer efficiency and even with smaller flocs due to the strong turbulence in membrane tanks a limiting factor for snd some studies indicate that the smbr can readily achieve 60 80 of nitrogen removal by snd 22 hocaoglu et al 18 evaluated the effect of three low dissolved oxygen levels below 0 5 mg l on snd in a mbr sbr membrane bioreactor sequencing batch reactor treating black water they found nitrogen removal remained optimal within the do concentration in the range of 0 15 0 35 mg l 70 73 of total nitrogen removal but nitrification was incomplete due to adverse effects of low do level the same authors reported that the total nitrogen removal decreased to 36 when do was increased to 0 50 0 55 considering low do concentrations represent an important aspect in the control of snd its variation can modify the activated sludge properties and composition reducing the do concentrations below 1 0 mg l does not appear to be an adequate option for operating a conventional activated sludge treatment system as it favors filamentous growth and impairs the sludge settleability and therefore the system stability and performance 23 also especially for smbr systems it is suggested that sludge filterability characteristics will be deteriorated at low do concentrations increasing membrane fouling phenomena 24 25 arabi and nakhla 26 performed experiments using a conventional smbr and a snd mbr operated at do concentrations of 3 0 4 0 mg l and 1 0 1 2 mg l respectively in their study higher membrane fouling rates were observed in the snd mbr as well as higher modified fouling index mfi due to the increased concentrations of soluble microbial products smp and extracelullar polymeric substance eps likewise paetkau and cicek 27 investigated the sludge characteristics and nitrogen removal in a snd mbr and observed that the system operated with higher tmp values greater fouling rates and higher soluble cod and teps transparent exopolymer substances values associated with the snd mbr however in both studies the snd process and the membrane fouling were evaluated at only one level of do concentration and no strict control of dissolved oxygen has been performed it is worth to note that in the paetkau and cicek 27 investigation the air flow for membrane scouring was different for the conventional mbr continuous aeration with air flow of 4 l min and snd mbr intermittent aeration with air flow of 8 l min 15 s of aeration followed by five minutes of no aeration in this condition it is difficult to explain the effect of do on membrane fouling rates tmp values and which do concentration was suitable for the snd process in smbr in addition ji and zhou 28 presented contradictory results on the detrimental impact of low do level on membrane fouling they found that total soluble eps protein and carbohydrate decreased from 23 9 12 2 μg ml at do of 3 4 mg l to 13 0 6 2 μg ml at do of 0 9 mg l which cannot justify the increase of fouling rate at low do concentrations despite the consensus that higher do concentrations lead to better sludge filterability and lower fouling rate the literature is controversial regarding which level of do will affect the eps production and sludge filterability while some studies indicated higher eps concentration and poor sludge filterability at low do concentration others observed lower eps production at low do concentrations therefore the effective approach for changing the operational parameters of an activated sludge system and their influence on sludge characteristics is still an important aspect in smbr when operated at snd condition the major challenge of this process configuration in smbr is not only to find out the best condition for nitrogen removal but also to avoid or to reduce the membrane fouling problem at a low oxygen concentration improving the overall system performance however little information is currently available on the eps production in smbr systems with snd process at different do concentrations particularly in a single stage and continuous flow system in this context our study aimed to evaluate the performance of the snd process using a smbr pilot plant operated with three different do and the effect of this operational parameter on the membrane productivity 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental set up and procedure this study was carried out at the international reference center on water reuse icwr usp using a smbr with a reactor volume of 156 l equipped with an automatic data acquisition system and the necessary instruments for measuring and registering at each 20 s permeate flow and temperature transmembrane pressure tmp oxidation reduction potential orp do concentration and ph fig 1 flat sheet ultrafiltration membrane modules fs uf fabricated in polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf with a mean pore size of 0 1 microns from sinap were used for solid separation the total membrane area was 1 8 m² 18 plates the permeate was continuously withdrawn by a peristaltic pump operating with a cycle of 9 min of filtration and 2 min of relaxation the pilot plant was maintained under ambient temperature during the study period 221 days and was continuously fed with domestic wastewater arising from the student housing and restaurant of the university of são paulo prior to the smbr system wastewater passed through a mechanical screening step screen and a grit chamber fig 1 during the experiment sludge was periodically removed from the reactor to control the mlss concentration resulting in an average srt of 41 days to provide the specific process conditions the smbr system was operated with one fine bubble diffuser for the mixed liquor intermittent aeration and one coarse bubble diffuser for the membranes system continuous aeration 15 l air min the dissolved oxygen concentration was monitored using a luminescent dissolved oxygen probe connected to a controller ds net policontrol this controller based on the concentration of the do concentration measured by the probe operated an electrically actuated valve solenoid installed in the mixed liquor aeration line thus when the dissolved oxygen concentration was below the set point the controller activated the solenoid valve that supplied air to the reactor by the complementary system raising the od concentration to the configured maximum value closing the solenoid valve to achieve the snd conditions and to evaluate the influence of the do concentration in snd and fouling processes three operational conditions were established based on the do concentration phases i to iii phase i 0 56 days was considered the control phase representing the operation performance of a conventional treatment system with an average do concentration of 2 0 mg o2 l 1 while phases ii 57 152 days and iii 153 209 days operated with an average do concentration of 0 8 and 0 4 mg o2 l 1 respectively representing the operation under snd condition 2 2 fouling analyses and foulants characterization during the system operation the mixed liquor was monitored to identify a possible correlation of its characteristics with the reduction of membrane performance under different do concentrations the sludge filterability was evaluated by the time to filter ttf procedure according the method 2710h 29 the ttf results were normalized for the mlss concentration resulting in ttf index s g mlss the fouling propensity caused by the mixed liquor composition which contains soluble and colloidal substances as well as suspended solids was evaluated according to the methodology described by judd 30 expressed by eq 1 1 r l a r s s r c o l r s o l where r l a is the hydraulic resistance of the sludge r s s the hydraulic resistance associated with suspended solids r c o l the resistance related to colloids and r s o l the resistance from soluble compounds the fractionation methodology was applied to estimate each resistance from activated sludge biomass a portion of the mixed liquor was centrifuged resulting in a supernatant whose resistance was evaluated using a stirred cell r s u p another portion of this supernatant was then filtered using a 0 45 μm membrane and the filtrate was used to estimate the r s o l thus the difference between r s u p and r s o l was attributed to colloidal particles r c o l the hydraulic resistance from each sludge fraction was evaluated using a filtration cell from millipore model amicon 8400 in which the effect of the gel layer formation is minimized by the magnetic stirrer during the tests the pressure was maintained constant at 0 2 bar the fractions of soluble and bound extracellular polymeric substance eps were determined by applying an extraction procedure adapted from the extraction methodology proposed by morgan et al 31 as described by judd 30 following the extraction the samples were analyzed for protein 32 and carbohydrates 33 2 3 biomass activity and nitrogen conversion process the microbial activity associated with heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria were performed by respirometry tests with mixed liquor samples from the reactor for all the tests a beluga s32c model respirometer was used 34 in this experiment the consumption of added substrate is translated by the consumption of do registered by the respirometer which defines the oxygen uptake rate our taking the our and dividing its value by the mlssv the specific oxygen uptake rate sour mg o2 g mlssv h is obtained the substrates used for the bacterial groups of interest in this study heterotrophic sourh and autotrophic nitrifying bacteria sourn were sodium acetate and ammonium chloride respectively the amount of nitrogen removed via snd was estimated by a mass balance of the nitrogenous material according to eqs 2 4

results and discussion 3 1 influence of do concentration on organic matter removal activity of heterotrophic biomass and sludge settling fig 2 and table 1 present the variation of cod and bod5 20 concentration in the permeate and its removal efficiencies obtained for the three operational phases throughout the experimental period treated effluent cod and bod5 20 was minimum in phase i when the dissolved oxygen was kept at 2 1 mg l 1 resulting in averages concentrations of 22 8 0 mg cod l 1 and 6 6 2 3 mg bod5 20 l 1 compared to phase ii and iii despite the lower values of cod and bod5 20 obtained in phase i no significant statistical difference was observed among the results of the three phases p value of 0 112 and 0 475 for bod5 20 and cod respectively during the whole experimental period regardless of the do concentration variation the average cod and bod5 20 removal efficiencies were more than 96 and 97 respectively results indicated that a reduction in do in the mixed liquor did not significantly affect cod and bod5 20 removal efficiencies fig 4 although the organic matter removal has not been affected by the reduction of do concentration the activity of the heterotrophic biomass was significantly reduced the respirometric activity of heterotrophic bacteria quantified by sourh decreased from 21 7 0 6 mg o2 g ssv h in phase i to 13 3 0 9 mg o2 g ssv h and 13 9 1 3 mg o2 g ssv h in phases ii and iii respectively however even with the reduction of the sourh values observed in phase ii and iii they are higher than the ones reported by ng et al 36 from 12 0 mg o2 g ssv h to 5 0 mg o2 g ssv h it has been suggested that a very low do concentration is necessary to affect the efficiency of organic matter removal because of the very low heterotrophic oxygen half saturation coefficient ko h lau et al 37 describing the growth kinetics of a floc former citrobacter sp and a filament sphaerotilis natans obtained ko h values of 0 15 and 0 01 mg l respectively it is not surprising that several researchers have found that the do concentration has little effect on carbon removal efficiency 38 39 as it was verified in this study however the do concentration might influence the competition between filamentous and floc forming bacteria and negatively impacted the sludge settling characteristics the results indicated a deterioration in the sludge settling properties expressed by the sludge volume index svi table 1 with an increase from phase i 162 55 ml g 1 to phase ii 266 33 ml g 1 and phase iii 272 36 ml g 1 although svi is not a concern in terms of effluent quality in a smbr system fouling tends to increase when the filamentous microorganisms are present in the floc structure impacting the membrane performance 40 41 3 2 influence of do concentration on the nitrogen conversion process the efficiencies obtained for the nitrogen removal by the smbr system are presented in table 2 it is possible to verify that the ammonia nitrogen concentrations in the permeate were low with average concentrations below 2 0 mg n nh4 l 1 even for the do concentrations of 0 8 0 1 mg o2 l 1 and 0 4 0 1 mg o2 l 1 in phases ii and iii respectively the highest concentrations of n ammoniacal were found in phase iii when the oxygen concentration was reduced to 0 4 mg o2 l 1 and may be associated with the reduction of the sournit which decreased from 7 2 0 7 mg o2 g mlvss h to 5 1 0 7 mg o2 g mlvss h in phase i to phase iii respectively even though the lower ammonia nitrogen concentration 0 87 mg n nh4 l 1 was obtained during phase i operation the statistical analysis did not indicate different values for the three phases p value 0 227 the nitrate concentration in the effluent close to the influent ammonia concentration on a nitrogen basis for do concentrations of 0 8 and 0 4 mg o2 l 1 indicates that complete nitrification consistently took place in snd condition a similar behavior was observed for tkn which is also associated with nitrification efficiency assuming the nitrogen incorporation into the biomass was the same for the three experiment phases no difference among the three operational phases over the observation period was verified the information about the impact of do concentration on the nitrification process in the literature is quite diverse but it has been demonstrated that almost complete nitrification could be achieved with do concentrations below 0 5 mg o2 l 1 however a higher concentration of nitrifying biomass is necessary meaning that a longer srt and lower organic load should be kept in the system 42 44 this is in accordance with the results from the experiments developed in addition based on the experimental evidence fitzgerald et al 45 suggested that ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob in nitrosomonas genus for example pseudomonas xanthomonadaceae rhodococcus and sphingomonas are responsible for low do nitrification in the case of a smbr system despite the presence of low do nitrification bacteria the presence of biological flocs with reduced dimensions resulted from the stress action produced by the intense membrane aeration favoring the do transfer through these biological flocs this condition increases the aerobic microzone which in its turn increases the oxygen supply for the nitrifying bacteria differently from the results for the organic matter and ammonia which showed no significant statistical differences in the removal rates the dissolved oxygen concentration played an important role in the total nitrogen tn removal efficiency fig 3 depicts the behavior of the total nitrogen concentration according to the change in the do concentration the level of nitrogen removal was consistently higher in phase ii 66 11 and phase iii 50 7 than observed in phase i 28 13 resulting in an average total nitrogen effluent concentration of 21 2 5 4 mg n l 1 31 6 5 6 mg n l 1and 45 1 8 4 mg n l 1 respectively he et al 46 who evaluated the f m ratio of nitrogen removal using the snd process indicated that higher denitrification efficiencies can be obtained with higher f m ratios these authors obtained a total nitrogen removal efficiency close to 86 using a do concentration of 0 8 mg o2 l 1 and a f m ratio of 0 423 kg cod kg mlss 1 d 1 however when the f m ratio was reduced to 0 272 g cod kg mlss 1 d 1 close to the value of our study 0 25 0 019 kg cod kg mlss 1 d 1 the total nitrogen removal efficiency was reduced to about close 70 in addition to nitrate the effluent nitrite concentration was also monitored during the three experiment phases the results showed a slight increase in the nitrite concentration when the do concentration was reduced reaching the maximum average value of 2 0 0 25 mg no2 n l 1 in the effluent of phase iii 0 4 0 1 mg o2 l yet in phase i in do concentration and orp of 2 1 0 2 mg o2 l and 237 73 mv respectively the presence of nitrite in the effluent was detected only once while in phase ii the nitrite was detected in the effluent only 3 times it is well known that the extent of the denitrification process largely depends on the carbon source quality and quantity which could also affect the level of denitrification intermediates such as nitrite and nitrous oxide n2o previous research indicated that nitrite accumulation can occur during the denitrification process if the available carbon content is not sufficient for reducing nitrate to nitrogen gas and also the formation of no2g can be observed mainly when a concentration of about 5 mg l 1 of no2l n is reached 47 48 therefore the nitrite results suggest that there was a limitation of organic matter during the phase iii which could be contributed to the low denitrification levels observed in this phase compared with the results of phase ii the occurrence of nitrification and denitrification process and the behavior observed during each operation phase can be confirmed by the variation in the alkalinity concentration δalk presented in table 2 as observed in table 2 the δalk for operational phases ii and iii were smaller than the δalk for phase i and the lowest variation in alkalinity concentration occurred during phase ii operation because during the denitrification process the alkalinity is recovered nitrogen compounds mass balance demonstrated an increase of the denitrification process with the reduction of the do concentration during phase i operation the average total nitrogen removal was 28 from which 87 were eliminated through assimilation by the biomass and 13 removed by denitrification while during phase ii operation the average total nitrogen removal reached 66 from which 37 were assimilated by the biomass and 63 were removed by denitrification for phase iii the total nitrogen average removal was smaller compared to the one obtained during phase ii but an increase in the fraction removed by denitrification was also observed similar results table 3 were obtained by arabi and nakhla 26 paetkau and cicek 27 which indicates that the snd process can be an alternative for the traditional nitrification denitrification arrangement 3 3 influence of do on sludge filterability membrane performance and foulants production the sludge quality can be indirectly estimated by measuring its dewatering capacity through a filter in this study the ttf method was chosen to evaluate the activated sludge filterability the obtained results confirmed that the do concentration plays an important role in sludge filterability since the ttf increases as the do concentration is reduced fig 5 a the worst conditions occurred during phase iii operation in which the average ttf reached 780 349 s almost seven times higher the value obtained for phase i operation ttf of 112 35 s and three times higher the value for phase ii operation ttf of 236 137 s although the mean ttf results from phase ii were higher than those from phase i the difference was not statistically significant p value 0 5345 but greater variations could be observed in the quality of the filterability of the mixed liquor in phase ii than in phase i which may be associated to the biomass stress at critical do concentration nevertheless regardless of the do level the average ttf was higher than 100 s indicating a sludge of medium quality sludges with ttf measurements greater than 300 s as obtained in phase iii are considered of low or bad quality 49 the sludge of medium quality filterability obtained with the average do concentration of 2 1 0 2 could be associated with the wastewater characteristics since there is a contribution from the university restaurant effluent which has higher organic and o g loads compared to domestic effluents the changes in the do from phase i 2 1 mg l to phase ii 0 8 mg l did not significantly affect the membrane performance fig 4 since the tmp profile are quite similar between both phases however the reduction of the do concentration to 0 40 mg l phase iii had a significant impact on the membrane performance the fouling was very rapid when compared with that of the previous phases i and ii with an stimated fouling rate 4 times hiher than phase i the fouling propensity results as well as the filterability and membrane performance results indicate that there was no significant change in the total resistance of the mixed liquor rla between phases i and ii but a substantial increase in phase iii was observed fig 5b in addition the reduction of do concentration promoted a change in the fouling propensity associated with the different fractions of the mixed liquor the results showed that there was a significant increase in the contribution of the fraction associated with the suspended solids and a reduction of the resistance by the soluble fraction which refers to the mixed liquor previously filtered in an acetate cellulose membrane of 0 45 μm to identify the groups of foulants associated with membrane fouling in each operation phase measures of soluble and bound eps as carbohydrate and protein were performed as shown in fig 6 among the eps fractions the highest eps increases were observed in soluble protein and bound carbohydrate an average increase of 89 was observed from phase i 1 2 0 3 mg g mlss to phase ii 2 2 0 5 mg g mlss in eps as bound carbohydrate when the do concentration was reduced to 0 40 mg l the bound eps as carbohydrate reached 3 5 0 5 mg g mlss which represents an average increase of 195 as compared to phase i the same behavior was observed for eps as soluble protein with a significant increase from phase i 2 6 0 6 mg g mlss to phases ii and iii 6 3 1 9 mg g mlss and 6 1 1 6 mg g mlss furthermore the reduction of do concentration promoted an increase in total soluble eps protein carbohydrate from 4 1 to 8 1 and 8 0 mg g mlss in phases i ii and iii respectively low do concentrations has been reported to reduce the cell hydrophobicity and thus cause floc deterioration which can increase smp concentrations 26 50 this can explain the higher soluble eps concentrations in phases ii and iii when compared with phase i despite the difficulty in correlating eps component protein and carbohydrate to fouling parameter due to differences in the available experimental methods for eps content assessment and to the different configuration of smbr treatment plants many authors pointed out that polysaccharides are the major component of biopolymers 100 kg mol 1 which have been deemed the key fouling causing substances during low pressure membrane filtration 51 52 okamura et al 53 showed linear correlation of the bound eps as carbohydrate concentration with the filtration resistance in which greater values of resistance were associated to greater bound eps as carbohydrate concentrations these findings can explain the deterioration of sludge filterability as well as the higher rss observed in phase iii which can be a result of the increase of bound eps as carbohydrate and a consequence of an oxygen stressed environment 4 conclusions this study evaluated the influence in the overall performance of a membrane bioreactor operated under three different levels of dissolved oxygen the outcomes suggest that membrane bioreactors can conveniently be operated in snd condition at 0 8 mg o2 l 1 reaching more than 60 of total nitrogen removal with no formal anoxic zone without significant drawbacks in terms of sludge filterability and fouling propensity furthermore in order to improve total nitrogen removal the mbr system could be operated with a higher f m ratio which can improve the denitrification condition on the other hand decreasing the do level below 0 8 mg o2 l 1 does not result in an additional increase in nitrogen removal and appeared less suitable especially from the

and acenaphthene adsorption from aquatic environments the produced nanocomposite was characterized by raman spectroscopy fesem tem xrd bet and ftir analysis the batch experiments were designed using central composite design ccd to investigate the impacts of the initial concentration of adsorbates total dissolved solid tds concentration contact time and adsorbent dose on the adsorption process analysis of equilibrium results depicted that the experimental data were fitted to the langmuir redlich peterson and dubinin radushkevich models for naphthalene and redlich peterson and freundlich models for acenaphthene adsorption kinetic studies were conducted and the results showed that the adsorption of both adsorbates followed the pseudo second order and intra particle diffusion models the pseudo second order rate constant of acenaphthene was lower than that of naphthalene and the rate constant of the intra particle diffusion model for acenaphthene was higher than that of naphthalene which was the result of higher water solubility of naphthalene the continuous studies were performed to examine the practical use of the adsorbent in the fixed bed water treatment process the performance of the minicolumn was assessed by thomas and adams bohart models considering the error functions and comparison between simulated and experimental breakthrough curves the thomas model was

methodology ccd central composite design afsps amino functionalized sand particles keywords acenaphthene naphthalene graphene oxide removal sand particles 1 introduction polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are composed of two or more benzene rings their chemical and physical properties are related to their molecular weights by increasing their molecular weight their water solubilities decrease and their octanol water partition coefficients kow 3 8 increase their low solubility in water and their resistance against degradation in nature give rise to their long existence and their accumulation in the environment therefore pahs are known as persistent organic pollutants pops 1 4 most pahs have been recognized as carcinogen mutagen and teratogen compounds however sixteen pahs are in epa priority pollutants list 5 7 based on the research conducted in china the emission of pahs was estimated to be about 25 300 tons in 2003 in addition it has been reported that the discharge of pahs has been increased because of the developing economy and a rapid rise in energy consumption 8 the widespread concern about toxicity and the emission of pahs in an alarming rate have resulted in many researches that were conducted to investigate the concentration distribution and the fate of pahs in the environment 9 10 pahs are introduced into nature through natural and anthropogenic sources forest fires are the main natural source of pahs on the other hand the combustion of fossil fuels automobile exhausts asphalt and coke production petroleum spills and industrial discharges are the major anthropogenic sources 2 11 the presence of pahs in surface waters airborne particles soils and sediments were recorded 12 most pahs enter the surface water through municipal runoff municipal and industrial wastewater and mostly through the atmospheric fallout 11 13 their fate in aqueous environments is highly affected by their high volatilization dissolution and adsorption on the surface of solid particles 11 in this study naphthalene and acenaphthene which are on the epa priority pollutant list were chosen among the pahs the international agency for research on cancer iarc deduced that naphthalene was probably carcinogenic for human based on experiments on animals 14 moreover high solubility volatility and toxicity of naphthalene caused remarkable concerns because it can be transported readily 5 15 in addition acenaphthene is more favorable to be selected among pahs because of its higher water solubility 16 many methods have been evaluated for pahs removal from aqueous environments such as microbial and chemical degradation 1 nevertheless the formation of byproducts is an inevitable feature of destructive methods 17 among all techniques the adsorption method has been used widely because of its cost effectiveness high efficiency and easy operation 18 19 therefore the researchers prepared a wide array of adsorbents 20 among which adsorbents in nanoscale size has attracted the attention of many researchers due to their high surface area 19 however the cumbersome separation of graphene oxide go via filtration and centrifugation from solutions and their possible aggregation are the main drawbacks that limit the large scale application of nano adsorbents 21 in order to address the aggregation and separation problem of graphene oxide many methods have been investigated but unfortunately many of them although they are environmentally friendly are expensive difficult to operate or cause reduction in the adsorption capacity of graphene oxide one of the offered solutions to the difficult separation is using magnetic adsorbents but the problem is that some of the adsorption sites of magnetic adsorbents get blocked which cause lower adsorption capacity 22 in other research graphene based adsorbents such as sponge like polysiloxane graphene oxide gel were synthesized at great expense to avoid aggregation we tried to synthesize a novel and low cost adsorbent that address the problem of separation and aggregation which can be applied readily in large scale water treatments 22 some nanoadsorbents such as graphene based adsorbents and carbon nanotubes have been investigated to remove pahs among them the graphene based adsorbents presented the greater adsorption capacity 23 hence in this study rgo was chosen for the adsorption of the selected pahs from aqueous media the primary object of this research is to bond go chemically on the surface of sand particles in addition heat treatment was used for reduction of go instead of hydrazine which is carcinogen the efficiency of prepared composite was investigated in batch and continuous modes for removal of naphthalene and acenaphthene in the batch study response surface methodology rsm was used to examine the impact of parameters and their interaction to achieve the optimum condition 24 the equilibrium and kinetic data were assessed by related models in order to operate and predict the performance of the adsorbent in the large scale water treatment the effect of adsorbent loading influent concentration and contact time in continuous experiments were investigated the performance and dynamic behavior of the adsorbent in a minicolumn were explored by two common dynamic models i e thomas and adams bohart models 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials

listed in table s1 were purchased from merck stock solutions of naphthalene and acenaphthene with a concentration of 500 mg l 1 were prepared in methanol 2 2 adsorbent preparation in this research rgo was immobilized on the surface of sand particles for this purpose the surface of sand particles has to be modified by amine functional groups so that go can be chemically bonded on the bed surface therefore the release of rgo from the adsorbent into treated water does not occur the go nanosheets were synthesized based on the modified hummers method 25 26 sand particles were sieved between 40 and 50 mesh to remove the impurities deposited on the sand particle surface they were socked in hydrochloric acid solution 1 1 v v for two hours after washing with deionized water then dried at 100 c for five hours then 400 g of acid washed sand particles and 3 ml of 3 triethoxysilyl propylamine were added to 300 ml of toluene and the mixture was maintained at 110 c for 24 h after that the mixture was cooled down to room temperature in the next step the sand particles were separated and washed with toluene methanol and deionized water several times finally they were dried at room temperature for 24 h to immobilize the rgo on the surface of the sand particles a suspension of go was produced by adding one gram of go to 100 ml of deionized water and sonicating for one hour afterward the prepared suspension was gradually added to 100 g of the amine functionalized sand particles and simultaneously heated then the particles coated with go was transferred to a stainless steel reactor purged with n2 gas and heated to 350 c for one hour 2 3 adsorbent characterization to identify the go and rgo on the surface of sand particles raman spectra were obtained using a raman spectrometer senterra 2009 bruker germany equipped with high energy laser diodes scattering the wavelength of 785 nm with the power of 100 mw field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem tescan mira3 czech was applied to take images with a high resolution for observing the morphology of prepared materials such as structures of acid washed sand particles and rgo sand particles moreover transmission electron microscopic tem zeiss em900 germany analysis was conducted in order to investigate the layered structure of rgo the specific surface area pore volume and pore size were obtained applying brunauer emmett teller bet quantachrome novawin2 usa analysis for investigating the crystal structure of graphene oxide the x ray diffraction xrd x pert pro mpd panalytical netherland with

and rgo afsps to detect surface functional groups 2 4 designing the experiments and optimizing the adsorption process in this paper we used design expert 10 stat ease inc for the optimization of adsorption process based on ccd to reach the minimum equilibrium concentration as the response the value of which depends on tds contact time adsorbent loading and initial concentration the ranges of the effective parameters were determined based on the pretests the parameters labeled as a b c and d were varied over five levels α 1 0 1 α table 1 real values transformed into the dimensionless

where the number of variables is shown by k after entering the ranges of variables in the software 30 experiments 6 center points and 24 axial points were designed based on ccd for adsorption of naphthalene table s2 and acenaphthene table s3 the number of runs was obtained by eq 3 3 n k 2 2 k c p the number of independent variables and the replicate number of central point are shown by k and

equilibrium and kinetic studies to study adsorption isotherms naphthalene and acenaphthene solutions with different concentrations 400 800 μg l 1 were loaded with a constant dose of the adsorbent 10 g l 1 then they were stirred on a magnetic stirrer for two hours kinetics experiments were conducted at various concentrations of naphthalene and acenaphthene 400 600 and 800 μg l 1 at the adsorbent dose of 8 g l 1 at definite intervals sampling was performed and the residue concentration of naphthalene and acenaphthene were determined using hplc 2 6 fixed bed minicolumn studies continuous experiments were performed in a glass minicolumn with 15 cm length and 1 1 cm internal diameter fig 1 to prevent the particles from leaving the minicolumn the bottom and top of the minicolumn were supported with the glass wool and glass beads 29 a peristaltic pump was used to pump the influent through the minicolumn in continuous experiments the effect of flow rate 8 and 16 ml min 1 adsorbent loading 12 and 24 g and initial adsorbate concentration 0 7 0 35 mg l 1 for acenaphthene and 0 7 1 6 mg l 1 for naphthalene were examined the operation of the column can be predicted by mathematical models such as adams bohart and thomas models which were applied to the experimental data in this study 30 thomas model assumes that the experimental data follow the langmuir isotherm and the pseudo second order kinetic model the nonlinear equation of the thomas model is presented as follows 31 5 c t c 0 1 1 exp k t h q e w f k t h c 0 t where q0 is the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent mg g 1

agilent 1100 equipped with a c18 column 5 μm 4 6 250 mm and uv detector in isocratic elution mode in the isocratic mode the composition of the mobile phase is constant acetonitrile water 80 20 was used as the mobile phase with a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 samples were filtered with ptef syringe filters 0 2 μm before injection into the column the injection of samples was performed using an injection port supported by a 50 μl loop 3 results and discussions 3 1 chemical bonding effect on the immobilization of rgo to investigate the effect of the chemical bonding between rgo and sand particles 10 g of the afsps coated with rgo fig 2 a and 10 g of sand particles coated with rgo fig 2c were ultrasonicated for 15 min as can be seen the chemical bonding between rgo and the afsps was strong fig 2b in contrast rgo was completely separated from the surface of sand particles due to lack of the chemical bonding fig 2d 3 2 characterization of adsorbent the ftir analysis was conducted to identify the functional groups of go and to confirm proper immobilization of go on the surface of amino functionalized sand particles afsps the related ftir spectra are shown in fig 3 a the peaks in the wavelength range from 3200 to 3600 cm 1 correspond to stretching vibration of hydroxyl groups on the surface of sand particles and existence of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups on the surface go and rgo 34 35 as can be seen the peak located in the range of 3200 to 3600 cm 1 is weaker for rgo in comparison to that for go indicating the partial reduction of go during the heat treatment the ftir spectra of acid washed sand particles and afsps demonstrated the existence of siosi sioh and sioh peaks in the range of 400 to 1090 cm 1 moreover there was an extra peak in the go and rgo spectra at 1632 cm 1 indicating the ch bond according to the research conducted by k yang et al the existence of ch band in the spectra of go and silica nanoparticles coated by graphene showed that graphene and silica nanoparticles were satisfactorily combined however in our research the specific peak ch was observed in go and rgo spectra nevertheless the ch band in go sand was so weak that it was not detected this phenomenon can be due to the much lower surface area of sand particles in comparison with that of silica nanoparticles causing the immobilization of less graphene on the surface of afsps on the other hand despite the high surface area of silica nanoparticles the ch band in the research conducted by k yang et al was too weak therefore the raman spectroscopy producing strong bands was applied to confirm the immobilization of graphene on the surface of sand particles as it is displayed in raman spectra of rgo afsps and go afsps fig 3b two notable peaks at 1326 and 1586 cm 1 exist called d and g bands respectively confirming the presence of rgo and go on the surface of sand particles the d band depicts the information about the degree of disorder in the crystal structure and the g band indicates the stacking structures the intensity ratio of these peaks id ig which specifies the level of disorder and exfoliation of go was higher for rgo afsps 1 33 than that for go afsps 1 02 it demonstrates a decrease in functional groups containing oxygen in the reduced graphene oxide and an increase in the isolated graphene domain in rgo which shows a proper reduction of go 36 38 the strong peak appeared at 464 cm 1 is related to the si o bond 39 the specific surface area of acid washed sand particles and rgo afsps were measured using bet method based on bet analysis the specific surface area of acid washed sand particles 0 161 m2 g was lower than that of rgo afsps 8 93 m2 g which can be attributed to the layered structure of rgo immobilized on the surface of sand particles in addition the pore volume and pore size of acid washed sand 2 99 10 3 cm3 g 1 and 3 01 nm and rgo afsps 7 65 10 3 cm3 g 1 and 3 43 nm were calculated using barret joyner halenda bjh analysis and display a slight increase in pore volume and pore size of rgo afsps fesem images presented in fig 4 a f were used to compare the surface structure of rgo afsps with acid washed sand fig 4b and d presented an irregular shape and a smooth surface for acid washed sand while fig 4a and c clearly showed the existence of rgo particles on the surface of afsp according to fig 4e a magnified image of rgo afsps showed thin and semitransparent layers of rgo wrapping around the afsps whereas there are no sheets in the same scale photo of the acid washed sand particles fig 4f in addition tem analysis were conducted to prove the layered structure of rgo according to fig 5 the thin layers of rgo can be seen easily the xrd spectrum of go showed a sharp peak at 10 fig s1 confirming the crystal structure of go 40 3 3 batch adsorption studies 3 3 1 statistical analysis the adequacy of the quadratic model can be appraised by the analysis of variance as presented in tables 2 and 3 the most significant terms have lower p value and larger f value 41 42 therefore according to the tables 2 and 3 a b c ab and b2 for naphthalene and a b c ac and b2 for acenaphthene were of greater importance additionally the lack of fit was not significant for both pollutants implying that the model was valid likewise the model p values were lower than 0 05 so the models were statistically significant according to the analysis of variance a significant quadratic equation was obtained using ccd as follows for naphthalene eq 9 and acenaphthene eq 10 9 n a p h t h a l e n e μ g l 1 272 82 33 90 a 70 48 b 122 04 c 0 38 d 13 84 a b 10 93 a d 12 45 b c 20 29 b 2 8 04 c 2 10 a c n a p h t h e n e μ g l 1 203 98 54 91 a 61 35 b 81 01 c 1 92 d 25 16 a c 25 42 b 2 9 45 d 2 according to tables 2 and 3 the high r2 values showed appropriate agreement between the experimental and calculated data likewise the difference between adjusted determination coefficient adj r2 and predicted determination coefficient pred r2 was less than 0 2 which proved the accuracy of the model for naphthalene and acenaphthene in addition adeq precision was greater than 4 for naphthalene and acenaphthene indicating an adequate signal 24 43 the predicted values of equilibrium concentration were calculated using eqs 9 and 10 and were plotted versus the actual values fig 6 a and b as can be seen the predicted points showed less deviation from the experimental data in addition the studentized residuals fig 6c and d followed the normal distribution and showed linear behavior which means that the normality assumption is satisfied 3 3 2 response surface graphs the interaction between the parameters and their simultaneous effects on the response can be investigated through the 3d response surface fig 7 a c and perturbation graphs fig 7d as it is shown in fig 7a an increase in contact time and the adsorbent dose caused a reduction in the equilibrium concentration of naphthalene at high adsorbent dose there are many adsorption sites available in addition the higher contact time can result in more naphthalene adsorption by the adsorbent furthermore it is clear that as naphthalene concentration decreases the amount of equilibrium concentration reduces as it can be seen in fig 7b according to fig 7c tds is not a significant variable and has no considerable effect on the response as it was reflected in anova table p value 0 9512 in the case of acenaphthene the 3d response surface and perturbation graphs are displayed in fig 7e and f respectively according to fig 7e at the maximum and minimum concentration of acenaphthene when contact time increased equilibrium concentration decreased however at the maximum concentration the slope of the graph was steeper indicating the higher adsorption rate as a result of a higher driving force furthermore because of the high initial concentration the collision between adsorbate molecules and the adsorbent surface active site increased so the adsorption took place fast the effects of all variables at the midpoint were displayed in fig 7d and f for naphthalene and acenaphthene respectively as it is shown naphthalene and acenaphthene initial concentration graphs were steeper than the others which means that the initial concentration was more efficacious than the other parameters in sequence the equilibrium concentration of both pollutants were more affected by contact time and adsorbent dose the almost horizontal graph of tds emphasizes the ineffectiveness of this parameter in the adsorption experiments to reach the minimum amount of equilibrium concentration the optimum conditions for effective variables were as follows minimum concentration of naphthalene 69 μg l 1 was achieved at 118 min adsorbent dose of 19 6 g l 1 and naphthalene concentration of 400 μg l 1 the minimum concentration of acenaphthene 45 μg l 1 was obtained at 120 min adsorbent dose of 20 g l 1 and acenaphthene concentration of 400 μg l 1 under the optimum conditions the minimum concentration of acenaphthene was lower that of naphthalene which was due to higher kow of acenaphthene than that of naphthalene 3 3 3 adsorption isotherms in general isotherm models show the relationship between the adsorbent concentration in the aqueous solution and that in the adsorbent while the temperature is constant 44 45 four isotherm models redlich peterson freundlich langmuir and dubinin radushkevich were used to find the best fitting of data in order to represent the adsorption behavior the explanation and the equations relevant to the isotherm models are given in the supporting information the parameters and errors were calculated and showed in table 4 for naphthalene and acenaphthene adsorption according to the error functions and r2 values the most appropriate model for describing naphthalene adsorption process was langmuir redlich peterson and dubinin radushkevich models on the other hand acenaphthene adsorption results fitted to both redlich peterson and freundlich models favorably moreover the maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent for acenaphthene was higher than that of the adsorbent for naphthalene because naphthalene has more affinity to water as mentioned before rl shows the nature of adsorption in the case of naphthalene the amount of rl was in the range of 0 413 0 584 0 rl 1 which indicates favorable adsorption the amount of 1 n describing the adsorption intensity was 0 767 1 n 1 which showed the favorable adsorption of acenaphthene 46 3 3 4 adsorption kinetics the adsorption mechanism was studied applying five kinetic models including elovich pseudo first order pseudo second order intra particle diffusion and liquid film diffusion models detailed description of the kinetic models are given in supporting information in this research five kinetic models were used at three different initial concentrations 400 600 800 μg l 1 chi square test χ2 and residual root mean square error rmse as error functions were applied so as to demonstrate the accurateness of the models and the results were listed in table 5 considering the negligible error amounts and a large amount of correlation coefficient r2 0 99 the intra particle diffusion and pseudo second order models depicted the kinetics of naphthalene and acenaphthene adsorption by rgo afsp aptly the mass transfer resistance between liquid and solid phases can be surmounted by a larger driving force which is provided by an increase in initial concentration 47 in this case due to the high solubility of naphthalene by increasing the initial concentration no significant changes were observed in the value of pseudo second order rate constant whereas in case of acenaphthene the increase in initial concentration caused a significant reduction in the rate constant of this model naphthalene is a hydrophilic compound as a result it is reasonable that the adsorption rate constants of pseudo second order model k2 0 0204 0 0228 and 0 0204 at initial concentration 200 400 and 600 μg l 1 respectively be higher than those of acenaphthene k 2 0 0132 0 00809 and 0 0058 at initial concentration 200 400 and 600 μg l 1 respectively denoting that the adsorption of acenaphthene occurred faster than naphthalene which is in agreement with the lower solubility of acenaphthene in addition according to table 5 as the initial concentration of naphthalene increased no change in intra particle rate constants were observed kp 0 0995 at initial concentration 200 400 and 600 μg l 1 due to the high affinity of naphthalene for water on the other hand as the hydrophobicity of acenaphthene is higher than that of naphthalene the increase of the acenaphthene initial concentration can result in enhancing the intra particle rate constant kp 0 1363 0 2122 and 0 288 at initial concentration 200 400 and 600 μg l 1 respectively in addition the intra particle kinetic model s data for both naphthalene and acenaphthene showed linear graphs passed through the origin which means that the adsorption mechanism is completely controlled by intra particle diffusion 48 moreover adsorption mechanism can be explained by hydrophobic interaction during the thermal reduction go lost most of its functional groups and amino functionalized sand particles were coated with rgo as a hydrophobic layer the hydrophobicity of rgo and the adsorbates naphthalene and acenaphthene results in the hydrophobic interaction between them 35 another adsorption mechanism which was discussed as the main adsorption mechanism in other research is the pi pi stacking 49 18 the pi pi stacking a noncovalent bond between aromatic rings is the attraction between poor electron area and rich electron area 3 4 adsorbent regeneration adsorption desorption cycles were carried out several times to investigate the regeneration of the adsorbent two grams of the adsorbent was transferred to an acenaphthene solution 0 8 mg l 1 50 ml and was mixed for two hours using a magnetic stirrer afterward the adsorbent was added to methanol and shacked for 15 min to eliminate the acenaphthene from the surface of the adsorbent and then was dried at room temperature after ten cycles the removal efficiency varied from 100 to 97 as it can be seen in fig 8 the presence of acenaphthene and naphthalene in eluent were detected using hplc which demonstrates that the pollutants are removed properly and the adsorbent was regenerated successfully 3 5 column data modeling the study of continuous adsorption was performed and two common dynamic models were used to assess the performance of the adsorbent in a fixed bed column breakthrough curves were plotted as ct c0 vs v l according to the adams bohart and thomas models at various flow rates initial concentrations and adsorbent loadings and finally a comparison between these curves and the experimental breakthrough curves was provided in order to nonlinear fitting the solver add in function of microsoft excel was applied by minimizing rmse error between experimental and calculated data according to table s4 there was a significant correlation between the calculated data by the thomas model and experimental results the correlation coefficients were in the range of 0 983 to 0 995 and 0 992 to 0 993 for naphthalene and acenaphthene respectively in addition the amount of rmse was less than 0 413 and 0 023 for naphthalene and acenaphthene adsorption experiments respectively as a consequence considering the breakthrough curves fig 9 the amount of error functions and r2 values it can be deduced that the experimental data were appropriately fitted to the thomas model for the adsorption of acenaphthene the same investigation carried out and the most suitable model was also the thomas model fig 10 for studying the influence of different flow rates two runs were carried out under the following conditions constant adsorbent loading of 12 g the acenaphthene and initial naphthalene concentration of 0 7 and 1 6 mg l 1 respectively while the flow rate changed from 8 to 16 ml min 1 by increasing the flow rate the slope of naphthalene and acenaphthene breakthrough curves became steeper and breakthrough time the time when ct c0 0 001 decreased 50 according to the results in table s4 as the flow rate increased from 8 to 16 ml min 1 the exhaustion time the time when ct c0 0 95 51 decreased from 345 to 110 min for naphthalene and 435 to 160 min for acenaphthene since the pollutants move faster when the flow rate is high the contact time between rgo afsp and adsorbent decreases subsequently equilibrium adsorption does not occur and the adsorbate molecules leave the column before the equilibrium state this phenomenon caused the lower equilibrium adsorption capacity q0 and contact time between adsorbent and adsorbates additionally as the flow rate decreased the value of kth increased 52 53 to examine the impact of various initial concentrations continuous experiments were conducted at the adsorbent loading of 12 g and a constant flow rate of 16 ml min 1 with increasing the initial concentration from 0 8 to 1 6 mg l 1 for naphthalene and 0 35 to 0 7 mg l 1 for acenaphthene the breakthrough curves became steeper saturation volume and kth decreased while q0 increased as it is widely known the difference between concentrations in rgo afsp and the solution results in the driving force 31 54 hence increasing initial concentration gave rise to a decrease in kth as it was mentioned the thomas model followed pseudo second order kinetic model and in the batch study the pseudo second order model was also the most appropriate model by increasing the initial concentration k2 decreased and the same trend was observed for kth in the continuous study the effect of different adsorbent loadings was examined by applying two different values 12 and 24 g at the flow rate of 16 ml min 1 the initial concentration of 0 7 and 1 6 mg l 1 for naphthalene and acenaphthene respectively as we expected by increasing the adsorbent loading the breakthrough time and breakthrough volume increased an increase in the breakthrough volume and breakthrough time could be ascribed to an increase in the number of active adsorption sites therefore more effluent volume and subsequently more time is needed to saturate the surface of rgo afsp 52 4 conclusion in this research reduced graphene oxide immobilized on the surface of amino functionalized sand particles proposed as an efficient and practical adsorbent to remove naphthalene and acenaphthene from aquatic environments the chemical bonding between rgo and the amino functionalized sand particles was so strong that rgo remained on the surface of sand particles after ultrasonication the raman spectra of the adsorbent confirmed the thermal reduction of go and successful immobilization of rgo on the surface of sand particles significant quadratic equations were achieved using ccd for naphthalene and acenaphthene the initial concentrations of adsorbates contact time adsorbent loading were significant parameters affecting the response in equilibrium studies several models were applied and experimental data were in good agreements with the langmuir redlich peterson and dubinin radushkevich models for naphthalene adsorption and redlich peterson and freundlich models for acenaphthene adsorption kinetics studies were investigated and intra particle diffusion and pseudo second order models were well fitted to experimental data for naphthalene and acenaphthene the dynamic behavior of the adsorption system was examined using a minicolumn packed by rgo afsps and modeled by thomas and adams bohart models the impacts of the flow rate adsorbent loading and the initial concentration were studied by increasing the adsorbent loading and initial concentration and decreasing the flow rate the saturation volume decreased an increase in the initial concentration gave rise to a decrease in kth which was in agreement with the pseudo second order rate constant the continuous application of the adsorbent and easy regeneration with little reduction in removal efficiency illustrate the usefulness of the adsorbent in conclusion the successful immobilization of reduced graphene oxide on sand particles addressed the problems of its separation and aggregation issues which make it possible to apply rgo nanoparticles readily as an efficacious adsorbent in fixed bed columns for water treatment acknowledgments the authors wish to acknowledge the nanotechnology research center of

14297,in this research graphene oxide go was thermally reduced and chemically bonded on the surface of amino functionalized sand particles afsps simultaneously and used as an adsorbent for naphthalene and acenaphthene adsorption from aquatic environments the produced nanocomposite was characterized by raman spectroscopy fesem tem xrd bet and ftir analysis the batch experiments were designed using central composite design ccd to investigate the impacts of the initial concentration of adsorbates total dissolved solid tds concentration contact time and adsorbent dose on the adsorption process analysis of equilibrium results depicted that the experimental data were fitted to the langmuir redlich peterson and dubinin radushkevich models for naphthalene and redlich peterson and freundlich models for acenaphthene adsorption kinetic studies were conducted and the results showed that the adsorption of both adsorbates followed the pseudo second order and intra particle diffusion models the pseudo second order rate constant of acenaphthene was lower than that of naphthalene and the rate constant of the intra particle diffusion model for acenaphthene was higher than that of naphthalene which was the result of higher water solubility of naphthalene the continuous studies were performed to examine the practical use of the adsorbent in the fixed bed water treatment process the performance of the minicolumn was assessed by thomas and adams bohart models considering the error functions and comparison between simulated and experimental breakthrough curves the thomas model was reported as the best model for predicting experimental data of both adsorbates abbreviations pahs polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons go graphene oxide rgo reduced graphene oxide rsm response surface methodology ccd central composite design afsps amino functionalized sand particles keywords acenaphthene naphthalene graphene oxide removal sand particles 1 introduction polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are composed of two or more benzene rings their chemical and physical properties are related to their molecular weights by increasing their molecular weight their water solubilities decrease and their octanol water partition coefficients kow 3 8 increase their low solubility in water and their resistance against degradation in nature give rise to their long existence and their accumulation in the environment therefore pahs are known as persistent organic pollutants pops 1 4 most pahs have been recognized as carcinogen mutagen and teratogen compounds however sixteen pahs are in epa priority pollutants list 5 7 based on the research conducted in china the emission of pahs was estimated to be about 25 300 tons in 2003 in addition it has been reported that the discharge of pahs has been increased because of the developing economy and a rapid rise in energy consumption 8 the widespread concern about toxicity and the emission of pahs in an alarming rate have resulted in many researches that were conducted to investigate the concentration distribution and the fate of pahs in the environment 9 10 pahs are introduced into nature through natural and anthropogenic sources forest fires are the main natural source of pahs on the other hand the combustion of fossil fuels automobile exhausts asphalt and coke production petroleum spills and industrial discharges are the major anthropogenic sources 2 11 the presence of pahs in surface waters airborne particles soils and sediments were recorded 12 most pahs enter the surface water through municipal runoff municipal and industrial wastewater and mostly through the atmospheric fallout 11 13 their fate in aqueous environments is highly affected by their high volatilization dissolution and adsorption on the surface of solid particles 11 in this study naphthalene and acenaphthene which are on the epa priority pollutant list were chosen among the pahs the international agency for research on cancer iarc deduced that naphthalene was probably carcinogenic for human based on experiments on animals 14 moreover high solubility volatility and toxicity of naphthalene caused remarkable concerns because it can be transported readily 5 15 in addition acenaphthene is more favorable to be selected among pahs because of its higher water solubility 16 many methods have been evaluated for pahs removal from aqueous environments such as microbial and chemical degradation 1 nevertheless the formation of byproducts is an inevitable feature of destructive methods 17 among all techniques the adsorption method has been used widely because of its cost effectiveness high efficiency and easy operation 18 19 therefore the researchers prepared a wide array of adsorbents 20 among which adsorbents in nanoscale size has attracted the attention of many researchers due to their high surface area 19 however the cumbersome separation of graphene oxide go via filtration and centrifugation from solutions and their possible aggregation are the main drawbacks that limit the large scale application of nano adsorbents 21 in order to address the aggregation and separation problem of graphene oxide many methods have been investigated but unfortunately many of them although they are environmentally friendly are expensive difficult to operate or cause reduction in the adsorption capacity of graphene oxide one of the offered solutions to the difficult separation is using magnetic adsorbents but the problem is that some of the adsorption sites of magnetic adsorbents get blocked which cause lower adsorption capacity 22 in other research graphene based adsorbents such as sponge like polysiloxane graphene oxide gel were synthesized at great expense to avoid aggregation we tried to synthesize a novel and low cost adsorbent that address the problem of separation and aggregation which can be applied readily in large scale water treatments 22 some nanoadsorbents such as graphene based adsorbents and carbon nanotubes have been investigated to remove pahs among them the graphene based adsorbents presented the greater adsorption capacity 23 hence in this study rgo was chosen for the adsorption of the selected pahs from aqueous media the primary object of this research is to bond go chemically on the surface of sand particles in addition heat treatment was used for reduction of go instead of hydrazine which is carcinogen the efficiency of prepared composite was investigated in batch and continuous modes for removal of naphthalene and acenaphthene in the batch study response surface methodology rsm was used to examine the impact of parameters and their interaction to achieve the optimum condition 24 the equilibrium and kinetic data were assessed by related models in order to operate and predict the performance of the adsorbent in the large scale water treatment the effect of adsorbent loading influent concentration and contact time in continuous experiments were investigated the performance and dynamic behavior of the adsorbent in a minicolumn were explored by two common dynamic models i e thomas and adams bohart models 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials

listed in table s1 were purchased from merck stock solutions of naphthalene and acenaphthene with a concentration of 500 mg l 1 were prepared in methanol 2 2 adsorbent preparation in this research rgo was immobilized on the surface of sand particles for this purpose the surface of sand particles has to be modified by amine functional groups so that go can be chemically bonded on the bed surface therefore the release of rgo from the adsorbent into treated water does not occur the go nanosheets were synthesized based on the modified hummers method 25 26 sand particles were sieved between 40 and 50 mesh to remove the impurities deposited on the sand particle surface they were socked in hydrochloric acid solution 1 1 v v for two hours after washing with deionized water then dried at 100 c for five hours then 400 g of acid washed sand particles and 3 ml of 3 triethoxysilyl propylamine were added to 300 ml of toluene and the mixture was maintained at 110 c for 24 h after that the mixture was cooled down to room temperature in the next step the sand particles were separated and washed with toluene methanol and deionized water several times finally they were dried at room temperature for 24 h to immobilize the rgo on the surface of the sand particles a suspension of go was produced by adding one gram of go to 100 ml of deionized water and sonicating for one hour afterward the prepared suspension was gradually added to 100 g of the amine functionalized sand particles and simultaneously heated then the particles coated with go was transferred to a stainless steel reactor purged with n2 gas and heated to 350 c for one hour 2 3 adsorbent characterization to identify the go and rgo on the surface of sand particles raman spectra were obtained using a raman spectrometer senterra 2009 bruker germany equipped with high energy laser diodes scattering the wavelength of 785 nm with the power of 100 mw field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem tescan mira3 czech was applied to take images with a high resolution for observing the morphology of prepared materials such as structures of acid washed sand particles and rgo sand particles moreover transmission electron microscopic tem zeiss em900 germany analysis was conducted in order to investigate the layered structure of rgo the specific surface area pore volume and pore size were obtained applying brunauer emmett teller bet quantachrome novawin2 usa analysis for investigating the crystal structure of graphene oxide the x ray diffraction xrd x pert pro mpd panalytical netherland with

and rgo afsps to detect surface functional groups 2 4 designing the experiments and optimizing the adsorption process in this paper we used design expert 10 stat ease inc for the optimization of adsorption process based on ccd to reach the minimum equilibrium concentration as the response the value of which depends on tds contact time adsorbent loading and initial concentration the ranges of the effective parameters were determined based on the pretests the parameters labeled as a b c and d were varied over five levels α 1 0 1 α table 1 real values transformed into the dimensionless

where the number of variables is shown by k after entering the ranges of variables in the software 30 experiments 6 center points and 24 axial points were designed based on ccd for adsorption of naphthalene table s2 and acenaphthene table s3 the number of runs was obtained by eq 3 3 n k 2 2 k c p the number of independent variables and the replicate number of central point are shown by k and

equilibrium and kinetic studies to study adsorption isotherms naphthalene and acenaphthene solutions with different concentrations 400 800 μg l 1 were loaded with a constant dose of the adsorbent 10 g l 1 then they were stirred on a magnetic stirrer for two hours kinetics experiments were conducted at various concentrations of naphthalene and acenaphthene 400 600 and 800 μg l 1 at the adsorbent dose of 8 g l 1 at definite intervals sampling was performed and the residue concentration of naphthalene and acenaphthene were determined using hplc 2 6 fixed bed minicolumn studies continuous experiments were performed in a glass minicolumn with 15 cm length and 1 1 cm internal diameter fig 1 to prevent the particles from leaving the minicolumn the bottom and top of the minicolumn were supported with the glass wool and glass beads 29 a peristaltic pump was used to pump the influent through the minicolumn in continuous experiments the effect of flow rate 8 and 16 ml min 1 adsorbent loading 12 and 24 g and initial adsorbate concentration 0 7 0 35 mg l 1 for acenaphthene and 0 7 1 6 mg l 1 for naphthalene were examined the operation of the column can be predicted by mathematical models such as adams bohart and thomas models which were applied to the experimental data in this study 30 thomas model assumes that the experimental data follow the langmuir isotherm and the pseudo second order kinetic model the nonlinear equation of the thomas model is presented as follows 31 5 c t c 0 1 1 exp k t h q e w f k t h c 0 t where q0 is the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent mg g 1

agilent 1100 equipped with a c18 column 5 μm 4 6 250 mm and uv detector in isocratic elution mode in the isocratic mode the composition of the mobile phase is constant acetonitrile water 80 20 was used as the mobile phase with a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 samples were filtered with ptef syringe filters 0 2 μm before injection into the column the injection of samples was performed using an injection port supported by a 50 μl loop 3 results and discussions 3 1 chemical bonding effect on the immobilization of rgo to investigate the effect of the chemical bonding between rgo and sand particles 10 g of the afsps coated with rgo fig 2 a and 10 g of sand particles coated with rgo fig 2c were ultrasonicated for 15 min as can be seen the chemical bonding between rgo and the afsps was strong fig 2b in contrast rgo was completely separated from the surface of sand particles due to lack of the chemical bonding fig 2d 3 2 characterization of adsorbent the ftir analysis was conducted to identify the functional groups of go and to confirm proper immobilization of go on the surface of amino functionalized sand particles afsps the related ftir spectra are shown in fig 3 a the peaks in the wavelength range from 3200 to 3600 cm 1 correspond to stretching vibration of hydroxyl groups on the surface of sand particles and existence of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups on the surface go and rgo 34 35 as can be seen the peak located in the range of 3200 to 3600 cm 1 is weaker for rgo in comparison to that for go indicating the partial reduction of go during the heat treatment the ftir spectra of acid washed sand particles and afsps demonstrated the existence of siosi sioh and sioh peaks in the range of 400 to 1090 cm 1 moreover there was an extra peak in the go and rgo spectra at 1632 cm 1 indicating the ch bond according to the research conducted by k yang et al the existence of ch band in the spectra of go and silica nanoparticles coated by graphene showed that graphene and silica nanoparticles were satisfactorily combined however in our research the specific peak ch was observed in go and rgo spectra nevertheless the ch band in go sand was so weak that it was not detected this phenomenon can be due to the much lower surface area of sand particles in comparison with that of silica nanoparticles causing the immobilization of less graphene on the surface of afsps on the other hand despite the high surface area of silica nanoparticles the ch band in the research conducted by k yang et al was too weak therefore the raman spectroscopy producing strong bands was applied to confirm the immobilization of graphene on the surface of sand particles as it is displayed in raman spectra of rgo afsps and go afsps fig 3b two notable peaks at 1326 and 1586 cm 1 exist called d and g bands respectively confirming the presence of rgo and go on the surface of sand particles the d band depicts the information about the degree of disorder in the crystal structure and the g band indicates the stacking structures the intensity ratio of these peaks id ig which specifies the level of disorder and exfoliation of go was higher for rgo afsps 1 33 than that for go afsps 1 02 it demonstrates a decrease in functional groups containing oxygen in the reduced graphene oxide and an increase in the isolated graphene domain in rgo which shows a proper reduction of go 36 38 the strong peak appeared at 464 cm 1 is related to the si o bond 39 the specific surface area of acid washed sand particles and rgo afsps were measured using bet method based on bet analysis the specific surface area of acid washed sand particles 0 161 m2 g was lower than that of rgo afsps 8 93 m2 g which can be attributed to the layered structure of rgo immobilized on the surface of sand particles in addition the pore volume and pore size of acid washed sand 2 99 10 3 cm3 g 1 and 3 01 nm and rgo afsps 7 65 10 3 cm3 g 1 and 3 43 nm were calculated using barret joyner halenda bjh analysis and display a slight increase in pore volume and pore size of rgo afsps fesem images presented in fig 4 a f were used to compare the surface structure of rgo afsps with acid washed sand fig 4b and d presented an irregular shape and a smooth surface for acid washed sand while fig 4a and c clearly showed the existence of rgo particles on the surface of afsp according to fig 4e a magnified image of rgo afsps showed thin and semitransparent layers of rgo wrapping around the afsps whereas there are no sheets in the same scale photo of the acid washed sand particles fig 4f in addition tem analysis were conducted to prove the layered structure of rgo according to fig 5 the thin layers of rgo can be seen easily the xrd spectrum of go showed a sharp peak at 10 fig s1 confirming the crystal structure of go 40 3 3 batch adsorption studies 3 3 1 statistical analysis the adequacy of the quadratic model can be appraised by the analysis of variance as presented in tables 2 and 3 the most significant terms have lower p value and larger f value 41 42 therefore according to the tables 2 and 3 a b c ab and b2 for naphthalene and a b c ac and b2 for acenaphthene were of greater importance additionally the lack of fit was not significant for both pollutants implying that the model was valid likewise the model p values were lower than 0 05 so the models were statistically significant according to the analysis of variance a significant quadratic equation was obtained using ccd as follows for naphthalene eq 9 and acenaphthene eq 10 9 n a p h t h a l e n e μ g l 1 272 82 33 90 a 70 48 b 122 04 c 0 38 d 13 84 a b 10 93 a d 12 45 b c 20 29 b 2 8 04 c 2 10 a c n a p h t h e n e μ g l 1 203 98 54 91 a 61 35 b 81 01 c 1 92 d 25 16 a c 25 42 b 2 9 45 d 2 according to tables 2 and 3 the high r2 values showed appropriate agreement between the experimental and calculated data likewise the difference between adjusted determination coefficient adj r2 and predicted determination coefficient pred r2 was less than 0 2 which proved the accuracy of the model for naphthalene and acenaphthene in addition adeq precision was greater than 4 for naphthalene and acenaphthene indicating an adequate signal 24 43 the predicted values of equilibrium concentration were calculated using eqs 9 and 10 and were plotted versus the actual values fig 6 a and b as can be seen the predicted points showed less deviation from the experimental data in addition the studentized residuals fig 6c and d followed the normal distribution and showed linear behavior which means that the normality assumption is satisfied 3 3 2 response surface graphs the interaction between the parameters and their simultaneous effects on the response can be investigated through the 3d response surface fig 7 a c and perturbation graphs fig 7d as it is shown in fig 7a an increase in contact time and the adsorbent dose caused a reduction in the equilibrium concentration of naphthalene at high adsorbent dose there are many adsorption sites available in addition the higher contact time can result in more naphthalene adsorption by the adsorbent furthermore it is clear that as naphthalene concentration decreases the amount of equilibrium concentration reduces as it can be seen in fig 7b according to fig 7c tds is not a significant variable and has no considerable effect on the response as it was reflected in anova table p value 0 9512 in the case of acenaphthene the 3d response surface and perturbation graphs are displayed in fig 7e and f respectively according to fig 7e at the maximum and minimum concentration of acenaphthene when contact time increased equilibrium concentration decreased however at the maximum concentration the slope of the graph was steeper indicating the higher adsorption rate as a result of a higher driving force furthermore because of the high initial concentration the collision between adsorbate molecules and the adsorbent surface active site increased so the adsorption took place fast the effects of all variables at the midpoint were displayed in fig 7d and f for naphthalene and acenaphthene respectively as it is shown naphthalene and acenaphthene initial concentration graphs were steeper than the others which means that the initial concentration was more efficacious than the other parameters in sequence the equilibrium concentration of both pollutants were more affected by contact time and adsorbent dose the almost horizontal graph of tds emphasizes the ineffectiveness of this parameter in the adsorption experiments to reach the minimum amount of equilibrium concentration the optimum conditions for effective variables were as follows minimum concentration of naphthalene 69 μg l 1 was achieved at 118 min adsorbent dose of 19 6 g l 1 and naphthalene concentration of 400 μg l 1 the minimum concentration of acenaphthene 45 μg l 1 was obtained at 120 min adsorbent dose of 20 g l 1 and acenaphthene concentration of 400 μg l 1 under the optimum conditions the minimum concentration of acenaphthene was lower that of naphthalene which was due to higher kow of acenaphthene than that of naphthalene 3 3 3 adsorption isotherms in general isotherm models show the relationship between the adsorbent concentration in the aqueous solution and that in the adsorbent while the temperature is constant 44 45 four isotherm models redlich peterson freundlich langmuir and dubinin radushkevich were used to find the best fitting of data in order to represent the adsorption behavior the explanation and the equations relevant to the isotherm models are given in the supporting information the parameters and errors were calculated and showed in table 4 for naphthalene and acenaphthene adsorption according to the error functions and r2 values the most appropriate model for describing naphthalene adsorption process was langmuir redlich peterson and dubinin radushkevich models on the other hand acenaphthene adsorption results fitted to both redlich peterson and freundlich models favorably moreover the maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent for acenaphthene was higher than that of the adsorbent for naphthalene because naphthalene has more affinity to water as mentioned before rl shows the nature of adsorption in the case of naphthalene the amount of rl was in the range of 0 413 0 584 0 rl 1 which indicates favorable adsorption the amount of 1 n describing the adsorption intensity was 0 767 1 n 1 which showed the favorable adsorption of acenaphthene 46 3 3 4 adsorption kinetics the adsorption mechanism was studied applying five kinetic models including elovich pseudo first order pseudo second order intra particle diffusion and liquid film diffusion models detailed description of the kinetic models are given in supporting information in this research five kinetic models were used at three different initial concentrations 400 600 800 μg l 1 chi square test χ2 and residual root mean square error rmse as error functions were applied so as to demonstrate the accurateness of the models and the results were listed in table 5 considering the negligible error amounts and a large amount of correlation coefficient r2 0 99 the intra particle diffusion and pseudo second order models depicted the kinetics of naphthalene and acenaphthene adsorption by rgo afsp aptly the mass transfer resistance between liquid and solid phases can be surmounted by a larger driving force which is provided by an increase in initial concentration 47 in this case due to the high solubility of naphthalene by increasing the initial concentration no significant changes were observed in the value of pseudo second order rate constant whereas in case of acenaphthene the increase in initial concentration caused a significant reduction in the rate constant of this model naphthalene is a hydrophilic compound as a result it is reasonable that the adsorption rate constants of pseudo second order model k2 0 0204 0 0228 and 0 0204 at initial concentration 200 400 and 600 μg l 1 respectively be higher than those of acenaphthene k 2 0 0132 0 00809 and 0 0058 at initial concentration 200 400 and 600 μg l 1 respectively denoting that the adsorption of acenaphthene occurred faster than naphthalene which is in agreement with the lower solubility of acenaphthene in addition according to table 5 as the initial concentration of naphthalene increased no change in intra particle rate constants were observed kp 0 0995 at initial concentration 200 400 and 600 μg l 1 due to the high affinity of naphthalene for water on the other hand as the hydrophobicity of acenaphthene is higher than that of naphthalene the increase of the acenaphthene initial concentration can result in enhancing the intra particle rate constant kp 0 1363 0 2122 and 0 288 at initial concentration 200 400 and 600 μg l 1 respectively in addition the intra particle kinetic model s data for both naphthalene and acenaphthene showed linear graphs passed through the origin which means that the adsorption mechanism is completely controlled by intra particle diffusion 48 moreover adsorption mechanism can be explained by hydrophobic interaction during the thermal reduction go lost most of its functional groups and amino functionalized sand particles were coated with rgo as a hydrophobic layer the hydrophobicity of rgo and the adsorbates naphthalene and acenaphthene results in the hydrophobic interaction between them 35 another adsorption mechanism which was discussed as the main adsorption mechanism in other research is the pi pi stacking 49 18 the pi pi stacking a noncovalent bond between aromatic rings is the attraction between poor electron area and rich electron area 3 4 adsorbent regeneration adsorption desorption cycles were carried out several times to investigate the regeneration of the adsorbent two grams of the adsorbent was transferred to an acenaphthene solution 0 8 mg l 1 50 ml and was mixed for two hours using a magnetic stirrer afterward the adsorbent was added to methanol and shacked for 15 min to eliminate the acenaphthene from the surface of the adsorbent and then was dried at room temperature after ten cycles the removal efficiency varied from 100 to 97 as it can be seen in fig 8 the presence of acenaphthene and naphthalene in eluent were detected using hplc which demonstrates that the pollutants are removed properly and the adsorbent was regenerated successfully 3 5 column data modeling the study of continuous adsorption was performed and two common dynamic models were used to assess the performance of the adsorbent in a fixed bed column breakthrough curves were plotted as ct c0 vs v l according to the adams bohart and thomas models at various flow rates initial concentrations and adsorbent loadings and finally a comparison between these curves and the experimental breakthrough curves was provided in order to nonlinear fitting the solver add in function of microsoft excel was applied by minimizing rmse error between experimental and calculated data according to table s4 there was a significant correlation between the calculated data by the thomas model and experimental results the correlation coefficients were in the range of 0 983 to 0 995 and 0 992 to 0 993 for naphthalene and acenaphthene respectively in addition the amount of rmse was less than 0 413 and 0 023 for naphthalene and acenaphthene adsorption experiments respectively as a consequence considering the breakthrough curves fig 9 the amount of error functions and r2 values it can be deduced that the experimental data were appropriately fitted to the thomas model for the adsorption of acenaphthene the same investigation carried out and the most suitable model was also the thomas model fig 10 for studying the influence of different flow rates two runs were carried out under the following conditions constant adsorbent loading of 12 g the acenaphthene and initial naphthalene concentration of 0 7 and 1 6 mg l 1 respectively while the flow rate changed from 8 to 16 ml min 1 by increasing the flow rate the slope of naphthalene and acenaphthene breakthrough curves became steeper and breakthrough time the time when ct c0 0 001 decreased 50 according to the results in table s4 as the flow rate increased from 8 to 16 ml min 1 the exhaustion time the time when ct c0 0 95 51 decreased from 345 to 110 min for naphthalene and 435 to 160 min for acenaphthene since the pollutants move faster when the flow rate is high the contact time between rgo afsp and adsorbent decreases subsequently equilibrium adsorption does not occur and the adsorbate molecules leave the column before the equilibrium state this phenomenon caused the lower equilibrium adsorption capacity q0 and contact time between adsorbent and adsorbates additionally as the flow rate decreased the value of kth increased 52 53 to examine the impact of various initial concentrations continuous experiments were conducted at the adsorbent loading of 12 g and a constant flow rate of 16 ml min 1 with increasing the initial concentration from 0 8 to 1 6 mg l 1 for naphthalene and 0 35 to 0 7 mg l 1 for acenaphthene the breakthrough curves became steeper saturation volume and kth decreased while q0 increased as it is widely known the difference between concentrations in rgo afsp and the solution results in the driving force 31 54 hence increasing initial concentration gave rise to a decrease in kth as it was mentioned the thomas model followed pseudo second order kinetic model and in the batch study the pseudo second order model was also the most appropriate model by increasing the initial concentration k2 decreased and the same trend was observed for kth in the continuous study the effect of different adsorbent loadings was examined by applying two different values 12 and 24 g at the flow rate of 16 ml min 1 the initial concentration of 0 7 and 1 6 mg l 1 for naphthalene and acenaphthene respectively as we expected by increasing the adsorbent loading the breakthrough time and breakthrough volume increased an increase in the breakthrough volume and breakthrough time could be ascribed to an increase in the number of active adsorption sites therefore more effluent volume and subsequently more time is needed to saturate the surface of rgo afsp 52 4 conclusion in this research reduced graphene oxide immobilized on the surface of amino functionalized sand particles proposed as an efficient and practical adsorbent to remove naphthalene and acenaphthene from aquatic environments the chemical bonding between rgo and the amino functionalized sand particles was so strong that rgo remained on the surface of sand particles after ultrasonication the raman spectra of the adsorbent confirmed the thermal reduction of go and successful immobilization of rgo on the surface of sand particles significant quadratic equations were achieved using ccd for naphthalene and acenaphthene the initial concentrations of adsorbates contact time adsorbent loading were significant parameters affecting the response in equilibrium studies several models were applied and experimental data were in good agreements with the langmuir redlich peterson and dubinin radushkevich models for naphthalene adsorption and redlich peterson and freundlich models for acenaphthene adsorption kinetics studies were investigated and intra particle diffusion and pseudo second order models were well fitted to experimental data for naphthalene and acenaphthene the dynamic behavior of the adsorption system was examined using a minicolumn packed by rgo afsps and modeled by thomas and adams bohart models the impacts of the flow rate adsorbent loading and the initial concentration were studied by increasing the adsorbent loading and initial concentration and decreasing the flow rate the saturation volume decreased an increase in the initial concentration gave rise to a decrease in kth which was in agreement with the pseudo second order rate constant the continuous application of the adsorbent and easy regeneration with little reduction in removal efficiency illustrate the usefulness of the adsorbent in conclusion the successful immobilization of reduced graphene oxide on sand particles addressed the problems of its separation and aggregation issues which make it possible to apply rgo nanoparticles readily as an efficacious adsorbent in fixed bed columns for water treatment acknowledgments the authors wish to acknowledge the nanotechnology research center of

14298,an integrated hybrid bioreactor ihb and integrated suspended bioreactor isb coupling aerobic anoxic and settling units was evaluated for industrial wastewater treatment with and without the installation of a rectangular hollow engraved submerged perspex media in the aerobic unit bioreactor performance was examined at different overall hydraulic retention times of 36 12 7 2 5 1 and 4 days respectively nitrogen mass balance was analyzed to examine the inhibitory effects of metabolic by products on nitrification in ihb both bioreactors exhibited a short start up period during acclimatization results show a lower effluent cod concentration of 15 85 mg l in ihb and 38 6 124 mg l in isb effluent ammonia nitrogen was 0 65 3 5 mg l in ihb and 0 3 4 5 mg l in isb effluent nitrate and nitrite were low in both bioreactors but lower in ihb mass balance analysis in ihb indicated that nitrate was the dominant ammonia metabolite and decreased with reducing hrt microfauna investigation showed that free swimmers crawling and attached ciliates were major protozoans in ihb while free swimmers and attached ciliates were dominant protozoans in isb kinetic evaluation demonstrates that microbial growth was higher in ihb the y k d μ max and k s for ihb was 0 1 g vss g cod 0 02 per day 0 81 per day and 1 26 g m3 with a correlation coefficient r 2 of 0 978 while it was 0 118 g vss g cod 0 04 per day 0 635 per day and 3 93 g m3 with a correlation coefficient r 2 of 0 988 in isb this study demonstrates that while both isb and ihb were effective for industrial wastewater treatment ihb performance was comparatively higher due to the inclusion of the submerged media keywords bioreactor hybrid integrated industrial wastewater hydraulic retention time microfauna 1 introduction biological wastewater treatment is an age long process widely used in the treatment of various biodegradable wastewaters its principle largely depends on the interaction of microorganisms with wastewater contaminants biological technologies have low capital and operational cost compared to physical and chemical processes however conventional activated sludge technologies are also associated with significant drawbacks such as large space requirement for installation of segregated units 1 long hydraulic retention time requirement unstable effluent quality 2 3 and disruption of microbial acclimation due to pollutant variation 1 therefore improvement of conventional systems has intensified the desire for the improvement of conventional systems has led to the development of various compact bioreactor systems several studies have demonstrated the advantages of compact systems based on defined objective a comparison of a fixed film bioreactor ffb and a conventional activated sludge cas system indicated the superiority of ffb in terms of removal efficiency and space requirement 4 cod and phenol removal for cas was 60 and 99 while it reached 90 and 100 for ffb at hrt of 25 and 8 h respectively furthermore authors noted that while cas occupied a land mass of 95 7 m2 and treated 45 m3 of wastewater per day ffb occupied a land mass of 3 24 m2 and treated 45 6 m3 of wastewater per day 4 relatively integration of oxidation ditch can account for 50 and 40 reduction on capital cost and space requirement respectively 5 yoon et al 6 found that economic investment in land acquisition building construction sludge disposal chemicals and energy consumption were lower in a modified system than in a traditional combined biological chemical treatment process recently hybrid bioreactors have received significant attention due to their associated benefits 7 development of integrated bioreactor is a sterling alternative for industrial wastewater treatment notably in environments with limited space or high land cost integrated hybrid systems are efficient cost effective 8 compact footprint installable in heavily populated areas or underground placement modular construction 9 12 small space requirement higher substrate to bacteria contact process efficiency biomass detainment in suspended and biofilm phase 13 simultaneous application of high capacity bio systems containing suspended and biofilm biomass in the same unit is a promising technique 14 the inclusion of inert solid material into hybrid bioreactor improves biomass accumulation pollutant removal and system stability under harsh operating conditions 15 biofilms that form on the surface of inert materials are described as active thin layer of microorganisms capable of improving organic matter and nutrient removal due to microbial spatial heterogeneity while slow growing nitrifiers shields biofilm from biomass washout 16 wastewater treatment in hybrid bioreactor involves the transport of pollutants through the inert solid packing material in two steps first pollutant transport into the water phase and second pollutant transport from the water phase into the biofilm 17 biodegradable contaminants that diffuse through the inert materials undergo oxidation by microbial populations of the biofilm and the liquid phase microbial species composition and biodiversity improve the stability of hybrid systems 18 the food value chain consists of various agricultural sectors including farm production food processing distribution and consumption the food and beverage industry fbi is a major stakeholder in the food value chain processing over 80 of principal agriculture production prior to consumption 19 the fbi is an important industrial sector and comprise of wide manufacturing processes including wineries soft drink juice breweries canneries frozen foods and dairy foods as a consequent the fbi require abundant freshwater resources in almost every aspect of its operation judging from the agricultural raw materials and manufacturing processed foods and drinks standpoints for instance the food industry in united kingdom and queensland uses about 3000 mm3 and 56 gl1 of fresh water annually 20 21 furthermore annual beer production by estimate exceeds 1 34 billion hl and about 4 11 hl of water is consumed for 1 hl of beer produced 22 interestingly higher proportion of water consumption in fbi is used in cleaning related activities 20 wastewater from the fbi can cause significant pollution of water bodies due to the additives applied in various food manufacturing processes for instance farasat et al 23 found high concentration of e coli in the effluent of fbi wastewater e coli is a known indicator of fecal water body contamination and causes wide range of human diseases thus high volume wastewater generated in fbi require adequate treatment before disposal to eliminate potential water body pollutants 24 whilst aerobic bioreactors eliminate the privilege of biogas production they can effectively degrade organic waste particularly from both complex and less complex wastewater sources 25 the integrated hybrid bioreactor used in this study allows the functioning of both the aerobic and anoxic regions which is suitable for substrate catabolism nitrification and denitrification of industrial wastewater the use of immobilized media for biofilm formation is characterized by large surface area resistance to shock load good liquid diffusion short start up period and high flexibility in terms of influent characteristics 26 furthermore it explores many benefits of submerged processes such as prevention of biomass wash out microorganisms immobilization retention of high biomass concentration and resistance to toxicity 27 this study therefore aims to develop a footprint activated sludge system capable of achieving high treatment performance even in environments where land is scarce due to its compactness the study compares the performance of an integrated hybrid bioreactor ihb and integrated suspended bioreactor isb for industrial wastewater treatment an evaluation of their performance in terms of organic matter oxidation and nitrification microfauna biodiversity and growth rate was explored 2 experimental 2 1 sampling process wastewater was collected from the influent chamber of a food and beverage industry fbi situated in batu gajah perak malaysia wastewater was collected using the grab method by manually collecting sample at different points within the influent chamber of the fbi sample was collected thrice a week and directly transferred into the influent unit of the bioreactor wastewater composition differed at various sampling period due to internal variations in manufacturing processes and differential disposal of waste products into the influent chamber wastewater composition is tabulated in table 1 the bod cod ratio was in the region of 0 344 0 353 which is considered biodegradable in terms of fbi wastewater the nutrient requirement in terms of bod n ratio was 100 6 which is suitable for aerobic process 2 2 bioreactor components the bioreactor has three components consisting of aerobic unit 10 l anoxic unit 20 l and settling unit 150 l fabricated using a strong polyvinyl pvc sheet the aerobic unit has a circular shape with liquid height inner

sludge was pipe was fixed to the 40 mm pore at the bottom and connected to a recycle pump ceca model qb 60 using pvc pipes the effluent outlet is situated 360 mm from the bottom two transparent perspex glasses with width and height of 250 mm were fitted opposite each other inside the settling unit the diagram of the bioreactor set up is depicted in fig 1 2 3 reactor set up and operation 2 3 1 integrated suspended bioreactor isb the aerobic unit was coupled into the baffle unit the baffle unit containing the aerobic unit was installed in the anoxic unit then the anoxic unit was subsequently installed in the settling unit and occupied a height of 430 mm isb was started using sludge collected from wastewater treatment plant of a food and beverage industry fbi in batu gajah perak malaysia the seed sludge was transferred 3 l and 4 l into the aerobic and anoxic units respectively diluted real beverage wastewater was fed to isb for acclimatization the aerobic unit is a completely mix chamber with one ceramic plate air diffuser at the bottom to produce fine air bubbles in upflow pattern wastewater samples flowed from the aerobic unit into the baffle unit the samples then flowed in upflow pattern toward the filter of the baffle unit where biomass was retained while liquid flowed into the anoxic unit in downflow pattern for nitrate reduction samples then flowed into the settling unit from the anoxic unit this configuration allowed the aerobic unit effluent to serve as the anoxic unit influent thereby eliminating the requirement for external carbon addition the experiments were started after 20 days acclimatization period during which the sludge acclimatized with the wastewater and effluent quality stabilized with cod and ammonia nitrogen removal exceeding 85 real undiluted wastewater was then applied to the system the do concentration in the aerobic unit was supplied using hailea hap 60 air pump at air flowrate of 60 l min 4 5 mg l while the temperature was about 27 2 c the internal effluent recirculation ier was conducted above the sludge bed of the settling unit into the aerobic unit at a ratio of 135 120 108 103 and 100 table 2 to the influent flowrate for the following reasons a to improve the mass transfer of nitrate produced in the aerobic unit during ammonia nitrogen oxidation into the anoxic unit b to dilute the influent load and c to serve as mechanical mixing for the anoxic unit through the periodic wastewater overflow from the baffle unit the ier was kept below 200 at all conditions to prevent the presence of dissolved oxygen in the anoxic unit experimental overall bioreactor hrt table 2 conditions were 36 12 7 2 5 1 and 4 days respectively the hrt conditions of the aerobic unit were 2 0 66 0 4 0 28 and 0 22 days while it was 4 1 33 0 8 0 57 and 0 44 days in the anoxic unit respectively table 2 sludge wasting was conducted at a flowrate of 0 2 0 2 0 25 0 25 and 0 3 l d for the hrt conditions respectively the solid retention time srt at the corresponding hrts was in the region of 33 19 10 1 8 and 6 1 days respectively wastewater was collected from the aerobic anoxic and effluent outlet for analysis every two days the steady state was determined according to the stability of cod and ammonia nitrogen removal within 5 across 4 5 8 10 days sampling period or more and mlvss stability hrt was shortened after each steady state condition by increasing the influent flowrate 2 3 2 integrated hybrid bioreactor ihb the reactor set up and operation in isb was adopted for ihb with some modifications a transparent thermoplastic homopolymer hollow engraved submerged perspex media was installed in the aerobic unit of ihb for biofilm formation diluted real beverage wastewater was fed to ihb for biofilm formation the experiments were started after 30 days acclimatization period during which the biofilm on the submerged media gradually matured and its color changed to brown filamentous bacteria and rotifers were visible within this period the effluent quality stabilized with cod and ammonia nitrogen removal reaching 90 real undiluted wastewater was then applied to the system the experimental conditions are presented in table 2 the overall bioreactor hrts of 36 12 7 2 5 1 and 4 days was achieved by gradually increasing the influent flowrate after each steady state in the range of 5 15 25 35 and 45 l d respectively the internal effluent recirculation ier was conducted above the sludge bed of the settling unit into the aerobic unit for the same purpose in isb at a ratio of 195 180 108 116 and 120 to the influent flowrate furthermore ier ensured that biofilm thickness did not clog the flowthrough holes on the submerged media sludge wasting was conducted at a flowrate of 0 1 0 1 0 15 0 2 and 0 2 l d for the hrt conditions respectively the solid retention time srt at the corresponding hrts was 41 30 22 19 4 and 15 3 days respectively wastewater was collected from the aerobic anoxic and effluent outlet for analysis every two days a similar steady state pattern in isb was adopted in ihb 2 3 3 media design the submerged media was developed based on the process design parameters for nitrification 28 the aerobic unit coefficients and wastewater characteristics was used to obtain the submerged media coefficients the tkn removal in the submerged media was obtained using the relationship between the assumed percent removal influent flowrate and the tkn concentration while the media surface area was determined through the relationship between tkn removal rate and tkn removal the media volume was obtained from the relationship between the surface area of the packing and the specific surface area the media area a was determined through the relationship between the media volume and depth while the hydraulic application rate was then determined from the relationship between the influent flowrate and the submerged media area a the bod loading was determined based on submerged media volume and area the volumetric oxidation rate was determined using the relationship between substrate concentration influent flowrate and media volume the media design procedure is outlined in 28 the design coefficients and submerged media characteristics is presented in table 3 2 3 4 media properties the transparent thermoplastic homopolymer hollow engraved submerged perspex media is represented in fig 2 the submerged media has a rectangular shape and made up of 10 layers held together by a series of detachable vertical plate connectors each layer has 156 pores of 10 mm for the flow of liquid and occupied about 60 of the aerobic unit volume perspex has been widely used for bioreactor fabrication but has been rarely evaluated for biofilm retention the tensile and flexural strength of the submerged media were based on the manufactural specifications the heat deflection temperature density and impact resistance of the submerged media was determined according to astm d648 d792 and d5420 methods respectively all analysis was triplicated and the average reported 2 4 sampling schedule cod ammonia nitrogen nitrate and ph were quantified every two days scod nitrite and tss were quantified at the start and steady state of each hrt phase dissolved oxygen do and temperature were monitored on daily basis suspended and biofilm solids were measured at each steady state 2 5 microfauna assay heterotrophic plate count hpc was used to quantify bacteria abundance while the type of microfauna was identified using leica dm lb2 japan optical microscope connected to a computer system sludge sample from the aerobic unit was collected and immediately homogenized and used for the assay sludge samples were diluted and a specific volume pipetted onto the nutrient medium 3m petrifilm and incubated for 48 h at 35 c identification of the colonies was conducted using a colony counter stuart sc6 operated within the counting range of 25 250 samples were then placed on the glass lid for microscopic observations 2 6 analytical techniques cod and nitrogenous compounds nh4 n no3 n no2 n were determined by hach methods bod5 apha 5210b and tss apha 2540d were determined using standard methods 29 to quantify biomass on the submerged media in ihb the method of liu et al 30 was adopted one layer of the submerged media representing 10 of the entire media was carefully disconnected to quantify biomass the layer was dried for 2 h at 105 c before its mass was determined the biofilm on the layer was quantified by deducting the mass of original layer from the mass of dried layer the obtained biomass concentration on the layer was then correlated with the number of layers on the submerged media at each steady state about 250 ml samples were withdrawn to quantify the suspended solids in isb apha 2540 e 29 ph was monitored using a sension ph meter doc022 9790248 equipped with a reference electrode pt 1000 probe the do concentration and temperature was determined using a do meter and a thermometer respectively analysis of parameters was triplicated for the three sampling ports 2 7 monod kinetic the monod kinetic model was applied to the bioreactor the linearized forms of the model is represented with the expressions 31 1 s o s e x θ h 1 y 1 θ c 1 y k d 2 θ c 1 θ c k d k s μ max 1 s e 1 μ max where s o and s e are the influent and effluent concentrations g l y is the yield coefficient g vss g vss d θ h is the hydraulic retention time d θ c is solid retention time day x is biomass concentration mg l k d is the death rate constant per day k s is the half saturation constant g l and μ max is the maximum specific growth rate per day the yield coefficient y and death rate constant k d can be obtained from the slope and intercept of the plot of s o s e x θ h vs 1 θ c eq 1 while the maximum specific growth rate μ max and the half velocity constant k s could be obtained from the intercept and slope of the plot of q c 1 q c k d vs 1 s e eq 2 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 media analysis the density of the submerged media was obtained as 0 83 g cm3 the average heat deflection temperature was in the range of 77 80 c at 1 8 mpa indicating that the media can withstand temperature up to 80 c without damage or disruption the average impact resistance was obtained as 15 6 ib ft using a striker diameter of about 15 86 mm at room temperature visual examination indicated that the submerged media were free of cracks until a load of 15 6 ib ft above this load a minor crack on the specimen surface was noticed the result shows that the submerged media can withstand high biomass accumulation without deformation or imperfections it has a high surface area durable good liquid diffusion devoid of clogging and appropriate specific weight 3 2 cod degradation acclimatization of isb was rapid as the bioreactor stabilized within a period less than 3 weeks cod concentration was evaluated from the outlet the evolution of cod concentration with time is shown in fig 3 an increasing effluent cod concentration of 38 6 60 90 102 and 124 mg l was obtained with decreasing hrt in the range of 36 12 7 2 5 1 and 4 days respectively this corresponded to cod removal of 98 97 95 94 and 93 respectively the influent wastewater composition periodically fluctuated due to internal process variations this had an impact on isb and caused a slight fluctuation in the treatment process however isb recovered and stabilized effluent cod concentration was higher at short hrt due to incomplete biodegradation this phenomenon was caused by the application of higher organic loading table 2 at short hrt and the inflow of more wastewater into the bioreactor the organic loading rate olr at the long and short hrt conditions of 36 and 4 days were 0 85 and 7 81 kg m3 d 1 in isb respectively this scenario at short hrt could reduce the interaction collision and biodegradation time between the substrate and the microorganisms and cause incomplete biodegradation 32 however effluent cod concentration at short hrt in this study was low suggesting that the reactor configuration enhanced the collision between bacteria and substrate higher effluent cod concentrations of 1090 1480 1900 2200 2500 and 3800 mg l have been reported at hrts of 943 4 86 2 26 7 12 5 11 06 and 7 80 days in a membrane anaerobic reactor mar treating sewage sludge 33 isb demonstrated a stable cod removal capacity exceeding 92 at all hrt conditions higher decrease of cod removal from 90 to 68 has been reported when hrt was decreased from 17 to 9 h in a sequencing batch reactor treating saline wastewater 34 this stability in isb was due to several factors including high c n ratio of the industrial wastewater compactness of the bioreactors which improved collision between microorganism and pollutants and f m ratio 35 evaluation of biodegradation in various units shows that cod removal in the aerobic unit was higher than the anoxic unit higher cod removal in the aerobic unit could be attributed to organic matter oxidation to co2 h2o and biomass in the presence of oxygen as electron acceptor oxidation of organic matter releases energy required for cell maintenance and synthesis when the substrate in the aerobic unit is exhausted endogenous respiration begins this phenomenon allows microorganism to prey on their own cytoplasm for survival this observations are in consonance with that of del pozo and diez 36 who reported a cod removal of 96 2 6 and 1 2 in the aerobic anoxic and methanogenic units of an anaerobic aerobic bioreactor the basic mechanisms responsible for high cod removal in isb is organic matter oxidation which released energy for cell synthesis and maintenance as well as endogenous respiration 2 in ihb biofilm formation was rapid and visible during the acclimatization the degradation efficiency effluent quality and the impact of hrt on ihb was similar to isb biofilm formation caused a swift cod reduction with decreasing hrt as shown in fig 3 cod effluent concentration was 15 30 51 72 and 85 mg l with decreasing hrt in the range of 36 12 7 2 5 1 and 4 days respectively cod removal was in the range of 99 96 2 97 95 and 95 with decreasing hrt the variations and fluctuation of the influent wastewater did not disrupt the system operation ihb achieved higher cod removal efficiency lower effluent concentration and higher system stability higher degradation capacity of ihb arises from surface colonization of the submerged media by biofilm which enhanced organic matter oxidation furthermore ihb benefited from the co existence of suspended and attached bacteria within the reactor inclusion of the submerged media in the bioreactor provoked large biofilm formation and increased biomass quantity this improved microbial immobilization reduced biomass washout retained higher bacteria population and reduced pollutant toxicity 27 biofilm that grow on the inert materials ingest minuscule microbial flocs and colloidal particles 18 while the presence of slow growing nitrifiers shielded the biofilm from biomass washout 16 and enhanced the oxidation of the slowly biodegradable compounds in the wastewater additionally the submerged media improved the stability of the bioreactor to resist shock loading and tolerate higher organic loading at short hrt it was clear that the biofilm on the submerged media in ihb exhibited higher metabolic activity and stability than their suspended counterparts in isb organic loading rate olr largely increased at short hrt and slightly caused an increase of cod effluent concentration the olr at long and short hrt of 36 and 4 days were 2 07 and 26 kg m3 d 1 in ihb however activities of biofilm in ihb were not disrupted due to the influence of the submerged media and the bioreactor structure 3 3 nitrogenous compounds the time course profile for ammonia nitrogen removal is presented in fig 4 ammonia nitrogen removal capacity in isb and ihb differed in isb the influent ammonia load gradually increased with decreasing hrt the influent ammonia load at hrts of 36 12 and 7 2 were in the range of 5 7 35 3 g m3 d 1 ammonia removal efficiency was still high and reached 77 94 however further decrease of hrt to 4 days 50 4 64 g m3 d 1 caused a notable decrease of ammonia removal efficiency to 65 ammonia nitrogen removal in the aerobic unit was high and reached 58 80 with decreasing hrt while it was 6 9 within the anoxic unit the effluent ammonia nitrogen concentration increased in the range of 0 3 4 5 mg l with decreasing hrt notably higher effluent nitrate concentration was recorded at the start of each hrt but gradually decreased to lower levels toward steady state this high initial effluent nitrate concentration was caused by the oxidation of ammonia nitrogen to nitrite and nitrate at steady state effluent nitrate concentration was 0 2 1 4 mg l with decreasing hrt a similar low effluent nitrite concentration was observed table 4 indicating that autotrophic oxidation was responsible for ammonia elimination within the bioreactor in ihb higher ammonia nitrogen oxidation stability was noted the influent ammonia load at hrts of 36 12 7 2 5 1and 4 days were 17 7 58 5 99 2 143 4 and 186 g m3 d 1 this high load did not cause any significant disruption of the submerged media activities although ammonia removal efficiency decreased from 92 71 with decreasing hrt ihb achieved ammonia removal exceeding 70 at all conditions ammonia nitrogen oxidation in the aerobic unit was high and reached 60 82 while it was low 6 17 in the anoxic unit the low ammonia nitrogen oxidation in the anoxic unit could represent an uptake in microbial growth the effluent ammonia nitrogen concentration in ihb was 0 65 0 91 2 12 3 1 and 3 3 mg l with decreasing hrt these values are lower than those from isb indicating that ihb demonstrated higher ammonia nitrogen oxidation capacity ihb maintained a stable ammonia nitrogen oxidation at the start of each hrt with slight fluctuation clearly lower than those in isb this stability largely caused by the accumulation of higher microbial population on the submerged media improved the effluent nitrate quality although effluent nitrate concentration increased at the start of each hrt ihb maintained lower nitrate levels of 0 2 0 6 mg l at steady state high effluent nitrate concentration at the start of each hrt was caused by ammonia oxidation this indicated that nitrate was the major ammonia metabolite in the reactor in line with low nitrate levels nitrite levels were low table 4 indicating occurrence of nitrification in ihb ihb demonstrated higher load tolerance and stability compared to isb in both isb and ihb the major processes responsible for high ammonia nitrogen removal in the aerobic unit were nitrification which is the biological decomposition of ammonia nitrogen to nitrite and nitrate by a set of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and denitrification which is the microbial degradation of nitrate to a gaseous form by a set of nitrate oxidizing bacteria nob 2 37 this biological decomposition of ammonium compounds encourages microbial cell synthesis the decrease of ammonia nitrogen removal with decreasing hrt could be due to the alteration of the dynamic balance of microorganisms at higher hydraulic loading which causes incomplete biodegradation 38 a similar ammonia nitrogen removal trend of 89 4 75 70 6 and 62 3 was noted by jin and zheng 39 with decreasing hrt in the range of 10 1 8 33 6 82 and 5 52 h respectively in a high rate anammox upflow filter the composition of microorganisms on the submerged media can influence the performance of ihb autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria compete for available oxygen nutrient and surface area on biofilm support materials 38 40 when hrt is decreased organic loading increases and cause a competition between heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria within ihb for available food resources slow growing nitrifiers occupy the inner part of the biofilm 40 while ammonia nitrogen removal decreased at short hrt of 4 days in isb and ihb it was more pronounced in isb indicating that biofilm nitrifying capacity was higher throughout the study this observation is in agreement with other studies 14 3 4 ihb product analysis evaluating the failure of a submerged media is necessary to understand its workability nitrogen mass balance was undertaken to highlight the removal mechanism of ammonia and its metabolites by the biofilm communities using the expressions below 3 n nh 3 gi n si n nh 3 go n so 4 n s n h 4 n s n o 2 n s n o 3 n s the error mass balance is expressed as 5 e n i n o n i 100 where g is gas s the solid i the inlet and o is the outlet the inlet ammonia loading in ihb corresponded to 17 7 58 5 99 2 143 4 and 186 g m3 d 1 respectively with decreasing hrt in the mass balance evaluation organic and gaseous nitrogen was obtained by deducting nitrate nitrite and ammonium from the measured total nitrogen in the bioreactor the ammonia mass percentage distribution in ihb is presented in fig 5 results show that over 60 of ammonia applied to ihb was transformed to nitrite and nitrate percentage of ammonia transformation to other species was directly proportional to ammonia loading at long hrt of 36 days 17 7 g m3 d 1 the major ammonia metabolite in the bioreactor was nitrate nitrate percentage gradually decreased with shortening hrt and was lowest at hrt of 4 days 186 g m3 d 1 this observation indicates that nitrification was the major ammonia elimination mechanism in ihb however while nitrate percentage decreased nitrite percentage gradually increased with reducing hrt this could indicate the toxification and inhibition of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob at higher loading free ammonia fa can inhibit nitrification depending on the total nitrogen species concentration temperature and ph fa exerts inhibitory effect on nitrosomonas at a concentration of 10 150 mg l and 0 1 1 0 mg l for nitrobacter 41 low fa values of 1 7 2 4 mg l in ihb indicate that the conversion of nitrite to nitrate by nitrobacter was slightly inhibited by ammonia however the inhibition was minimal due to the manipulative increase of influent wastewater which reduced the interference the total nitrogen analysis indicated an increasing ammonium concentration ammonium concentration increased relative to influent load and reached 30 at short hrt of 4 days 186 g m3 d 1 however ihb maintained ammonia removal exceeding 70 at the highest nitrogen loading nitrogen loss could be attributed to organic nitrogen released from leached biomass and gaseous nitrogen the percentage of organic and gaseous nitrogen ogn was low 1 2 4 indicating that nitrification occurred without the creation of anaerobic zone within the submerged media a mass balance error of 3 1 4 56 were obtained with decreasing hrt the unaccounted nitrogen metabolites within the bioreactor could contribute to nitrogen error in this study this observation is consistent with other studies 42 the loss in nitrogen mass balance could indicate that ammonia was transformed into metabolites other than nitrite and nitrate only organic nitrogen from the biomass and gaseous nitrogen were two metabolites not considered gaseous nitrogen is produced through denitrification in the anaerobic zone of the submerged media when nitrite and nitrate is reduced subject to the mass balance the submerged media demonstrated the capacity to operate at long period and at high loading 3 5 ph evaluation the profile of ph evolution in isb and ihb is represented in fig 6 the effluent ph of isb and ihb were near similar but significantly fluctuated during the study the influent ph was in the region of 4 7 5 3 but only reached 7 03 in two sampling occasions in isb the effluent ph was in the region of 7 5 8 9 while it was about 7 09 8 4 in ihb the ph value in both bioreactors fluctuated but was in the optimum range of microbial metabolic activities for organic matter oxidation and nitrification denitrification processes several mechanisms can influence fluctuation of effluent ph in isb and ihb during nitrification alkalinity is consumed in the aerobic unit the decrease of ph value in isb and ihb was caused by alkalinity consumption during nitrification 43 44 however at the end of nitrification ph values increased due to the termination of alkalinity consumption co2 stripping and substrate depletion 45 46 therefore the ph fluctuations was due to decomposition of fermentation products during organic matter bio oxidation alkalinity consumption during nitrification termination of alkalinity consumption after nitrification transfer of the accumulated co2 in the mixed liquor of the aerobic unit during nitrification into the anoxic unit during denitrification and alkalinity recovery after denitrification 44 46 a similar observation was made by ruiz et al 47 who noted that optimum ph levels for nitrification was between 6 45 to 8 95 thus isb and ihb operated within the optimum ph range 3 6 solids evaluation table 4 shows the biomass concentration in isb and ihb biomass concentration was directly influenced by hrt in this study when hrt is increased organic loading rate and food to microorganisms f m ratio decrease table 2 as the hrt is decreased organic loading rate and f m ratio increases at low f m ratios the amount of substrate in the bioreactor is low and insufficient to maintain microbial growth causing endogenous respiration of microorganisms residues left from endogenous metabolism primarily consist of cell capsules which are very light 48 mlvss reached a higher level table 4 when hrt was reduced due to higher substrate loading applied at shorter hrt at shorter hrt organic loading olr and food to microorganisms f m ratio was higher compared to longer hrt table 2 this implies that more oxidizable substrates which can enhance microbial growth were available to microorganisms within the bioreactors at shorter hrt furthermore substrate removal rate r ssr increased with decreasing hrt in both isb and ihb reaching 7 81 and 24 7 kg m3 d 1 at hrt of 4 days table 2 respectively clearly the maximum loading rate was not attained in both isb and ihb it is well known that the substrate removal rate r ssr decreases when the maximum loading rate is attained the mlvss rapidly built up at the start of each hrt run but slowed down with time the mlvss was not absolutely constant but fluctuated around a mean value and finally attained stabilization state toward the end of study at the start of each hrt run microorganisms were provided with unlimited food and oxygen which caused the bacteria to dwell in the exponential growth phase while the mlvss increased substrate was depleting due to microbial consumption and became limiting causing bacteria to enter endogenous phase the mlvss concentration at the long and short hrt of 36 and 4 days were 2 67 and 4 7 g l in isb and 3 3 and 17 3 g l in ihb respectively a similar observation was made by sun et al 49 who evaluated the influence of three hrt conditions of 6 12 and 24 h on the behavior of submerged membrane bioreactor the authors found that mlss was higher at shorter hrt of 6 h huang et al 50 evaluated the influence of hrt and srt on submerged anaerobic membrane bioreactor treating low strength wastewater and found that at a fixed srt of 30 days and hrt conditions of 12 10 and 8 h mlvss concentration increased in the range of 5132 6352 and 6500 mg l respectively a similar trend was observed when srt was varied diez et al 48 noted that mlvss concentration increased in the range of 3 3 3 6 3 8 and 4 9 g l with decreasing hrt in the range of 16 12 10 and 8 h respectively the authors noted that further decrease of hrt to 7 6 5 and 4 5 h and at higher organic loading rate olr mlvss decreased in the range of 4 5 4 4 3 5 and 3 3 g l the disparity between mlvss concentrations of isb and ihb was due to their inhabitation environment microorganisms which attach on the surface of inert media have faster growth rate than the suspended counterpart due to their exposure to available food resources effluent tss concentration in isb and ihb was low table 4 indicating good biodegradability capacity of the bioreactors the submerged media in ihb could serve as an entrapment filter for suspended solids 40 both isb and ihb demonstrated good solid separation capabilities and high settling capacity 3 7 microfauna assay microbial abundance and diversity was evaluated in both isb and ihb the bioreactor stability and conformity was monitored through the presence of microfauna species protozoans and metazoans are known indicators of system stability in activated sludge 51 in isb and ihb protozoans were primarily dominant making up over 80 of the total microfauna abundance in each bioreactor both bioreactors displayed near similar abundance of protozoans and metazoans protozoans such as free swimmers and attached ciliates were found in both isb and ihb however crawling ciliates were found only in ihb ciliates are predators and fundamentally influence activated sludge processes ciliates are bio indicators of activated sludge activities due to their ability to respond to alterations in wastewater composition and operating conditions 52 similarly metazoans such as rotifers and nematodes were dominantly found in isb and ihb microfauna variation and diversity was observed at different stages of the study during acclimatization free swimmers were dominantly present within isb and ihb after acclimatization attached ciliates were found in isb while both ciliates crawling and attached were found in ihb nematodes rapidly disappeared but reappeared in low quantities at short hrt while rotifer population increased this observation is consistent with literature 53 this microbial biodiversity at different experimental stage could be attributed to substrate gradient and operating conditions 54 during substrate depletion free swimmers disappear due to their inability to compete for available scarce substrate within the bioreactor however attached ciliates and metazoans has the capacity to survive under conditions of famine while favorably competing for the depleted substrate and living as predator on other bacteria 55 rotifers are primary metazoans found in biological wastewater treatment and they are considered predators due to their capacity to ingest large quantities of bacteria and suspended particles when rotifers consume dispersed and unflocculated bacteria they encourage cell replacement and improve effluent quality 56 thus the rotifers in isb and ihb contributed to the stability of the bioreactors the increase in number of microorganisms after acclimatization suggests that the microorganisms were convenient within their environment these protozoans and metazoans are predators and can feed on bacteria and suspended particles while improving flocculation the microfauna abundance and biodiversity found in this study indicates that both isb and ihb were operating at good condition 57 effective activated sludge systems are characterized with large quantity of microfauna species and biodiversity the presence of high amount of ciliate species in a bioreactor implies an adequate bod biodegradation and high effluent clarity 3 8 monod kinetic the kinetic plot is shown in fig 7 the y k d μ max and k s for isb were obtained as 0 118 g vss g cod 0 04 per day 0 635 per day and 3 93 g m3 with a correlation coefficient r 2 of 0 988 respectively while in ihb it was 0 1 g vss g cod 0 02 per day 0 81 per day and 1 26 g m3 with a correlation coefficient r 2 of 0 978 respectively the obtained kinetic coefficients was in close agreement with the report of işik and sponza 58 who obtained a y k d μ max and k s values of 0 125 g vss g cod 1 0 0065 per day 0 105 per day and 4000 mg l respectively the values of k s determines the affinity between microorganisms and substrate 59 the k s values in this study indicate that the affinity between the microorganisms and the substrate was higher in ihb than isb the variations in the kinetic values have been attributed to wastewater characteristics type of microorganisms and reactor configuration 4 conclusion an integrated hybrid bioreactor ihb was used for industrial wastewater treatment ihb was compared with an integrated suspended bioreactor isb both bioreactors demonstrated high industrial wastewater treatment capacity at all experimental conditions cod removal was higher and more stable than ammonia nitrogen removal implying that the microorganisms within the bioreactors have a higher preference for carbon than nitrogen ihb was more stable than isb due to higher biomass accumulation on the submerged media in the aerobic unit this study can conclude as follows i acclimatization period of isb and ihb was short due to the compactness of the bioreactor which promoted higher contact between pollutant and microorganisms ii inclusion of the hollow engraved submerged media in ihb enhanced bioreactor performance by retaining higher microbial population iii microfauna species and biodiversity within isb and ihb support our findings that the bioreactor was stable throughout the study iv isb and ihb can be used for industrial wastewater treatment and other wastewaters particularly in areas where land is rare or costly v in furtherance of cost reduction application of real time control techniques can enhance the uniqueness of isb and ihb acknowledgments this study was supported by universiti teknologi petronas utp universiti teknologi malaysia utm provided technical support we are grateful to utp and utm

14298,an integrated hybrid bioreactor ihb and integrated suspended bioreactor isb coupling aerobic anoxic and settling units was evaluated for industrial wastewater treatment with and without the installation of a rectangular hollow engraved submerged perspex media in the aerobic unit bioreactor performance was examined at different overall hydraulic retention times of 36 12 7 2 5 1 and 4 days respectively nitrogen mass balance was analyzed to examine the inhibitory effects of metabolic by products on nitrification in ihb both bioreactors exhibited a short start up period during acclimatization results show a lower effluent cod concentration of 15 85 mg l in ihb and 38 6 124 mg l in isb effluent ammonia nitrogen was 0 65 3 5 mg l in ihb and 0 3 4 5 mg l in isb effluent nitrate and nitrite were low in both bioreactors but lower in ihb mass balance analysis in ihb indicated that nitrate was the dominant ammonia metabolite and decreased with reducing hrt microfauna investigation showed that free swimmers crawling and attached ciliates were major protozoans in ihb while free swimmers and attached ciliates were dominant protozoans in isb kinetic evaluation demonstrates that microbial growth was higher in ihb the y k d μ max and k s for ihb was 0 1 g vss g cod 0 02 per day 0 81 per day and 1 26 g m3 with a correlation coefficient r 2 of 0 978 while it was 0 118 g vss g cod 0 04 per day 0 635 per day and 3 93 g m3 with a correlation coefficient r 2 of 0 988 in isb this study demonstrates that while both isb and ihb were effective for industrial wastewater treatment ihb performance was comparatively higher due to the inclusion of the submerged media keywords bioreactor hybrid integrated industrial wastewater hydraulic retention time microfauna 1 introduction biological wastewater treatment is an age long process widely used in the treatment of various biodegradable wastewaters its principle largely depends on the interaction of microorganisms with wastewater contaminants biological technologies have low capital and operational cost compared to physical and chemical processes however conventional activated sludge technologies are also associated with significant drawbacks such as large space requirement for installation of segregated units 1 long hydraulic retention time requirement unstable effluent quality 2 3 and disruption of microbial acclimation due to pollutant variation 1 therefore improvement of conventional systems has intensified the desire for the improvement of conventional systems has led to the development of various compact bioreactor systems several studies have demonstrated the advantages of compact systems based on defined objective a comparison of a fixed film bioreactor ffb and a conventional activated sludge cas system indicated the superiority of ffb in terms of removal efficiency and space requirement 4 cod and phenol removal for cas was 60 and 99 while it reached 90 and 100 for ffb at hrt of 25 and 8 h respectively furthermore authors noted that while cas occupied a land mass of 95 7 m2 and treated 45 m3 of wastewater per day ffb occupied a land mass of 3 24 m2 and treated 45 6 m3 of wastewater per day 4 relatively integration of oxidation ditch can account for 50 and 40 reduction on capital cost and space requirement respectively 5 yoon et al 6 found that economic investment in land acquisition building construction sludge disposal chemicals and energy consumption were lower in a modified system than in a traditional combined biological chemical treatment process recently hybrid bioreactors have received significant attention due to their associated benefits 7 development of integrated bioreactor is a sterling alternative for industrial wastewater treatment notably in environments with limited space or high land cost integrated hybrid systems are efficient cost effective 8 compact footprint installable in heavily populated areas or underground placement modular construction 9 12 small space requirement higher substrate to bacteria contact process efficiency biomass detainment in suspended and biofilm phase 13 simultaneous application of high capacity bio systems containing suspended and biofilm biomass in the same unit is a promising technique 14 the inclusion of inert solid material into hybrid bioreactor improves biomass accumulation pollutant removal and system stability under harsh operating conditions 15 biofilms that form on the surface of inert materials are described as active thin layer of microorganisms capable of improving organic matter and nutrient removal due to microbial spatial heterogeneity while slow growing nitrifiers shields biofilm from biomass washout 16 wastewater treatment in hybrid bioreactor involves the transport of pollutants through the inert solid packing material in two steps first pollutant transport into the water phase and second pollutant transport from the water phase into the biofilm 17 biodegradable contaminants that diffuse through the inert materials undergo oxidation by microbial populations of the biofilm and the liquid phase microbial species composition and biodiversity improve the stability of hybrid systems 18 the food value chain consists of various agricultural sectors including farm production food processing distribution and consumption the food and beverage industry fbi is a major stakeholder in the food value chain processing over 80 of principal agriculture production prior to consumption 19 the fbi is an important industrial sector and comprise of wide manufacturing processes including wineries soft drink juice breweries canneries frozen foods and dairy foods as a consequent the fbi require abundant freshwater resources in almost every aspect of its operation judging from the agricultural raw materials and manufacturing processed foods and drinks standpoints for instance the food industry in united kingdom and queensland uses about 3000 mm3 and 56 gl1 of fresh water annually 20 21 furthermore annual beer production by estimate exceeds 1 34 billion hl and about 4 11 hl of water is consumed for 1 hl of beer produced 22 interestingly higher proportion of water consumption in fbi is used in cleaning related activities 20 wastewater from the fbi can cause significant pollution of water bodies due to the additives applied in various food manufacturing processes for instance farasat et al 23 found high concentration of e coli in the effluent of fbi wastewater e coli is a known indicator of fecal water body contamination and causes wide range of human diseases thus high volume wastewater generated in fbi require adequate treatment before disposal to eliminate potential water body pollutants 24 whilst aerobic bioreactors eliminate the privilege of biogas production they can effectively degrade organic waste particularly from both complex and less complex wastewater sources 25 the integrated hybrid bioreactor used in this study allows the functioning of both the aerobic and anoxic regions which is suitable for substrate catabolism nitrification and denitrification of industrial wastewater the use of immobilized media for biofilm formation is characterized by large surface area resistance to shock load good liquid diffusion short start up period and high flexibility in terms of influent characteristics 26 furthermore it explores many benefits of submerged processes such as prevention of biomass wash out microorganisms immobilization retention of high biomass concentration and resistance to toxicity 27 this study therefore aims to develop a footprint activated sludge system capable of achieving high treatment performance even in environments where land is scarce due to its compactness the study compares the performance of an integrated hybrid bioreactor ihb and integrated suspended bioreactor isb for industrial wastewater treatment an evaluation of their performance in terms of organic matter oxidation and nitrification microfauna biodiversity and growth rate was explored 2 experimental 2 1 sampling process wastewater was collected from the influent chamber of a food and beverage industry fbi situated in batu gajah perak malaysia wastewater was collected using the grab method by manually collecting sample at different points within the influent chamber of the fbi sample was collected thrice a week and directly transferred into the influent unit of the bioreactor wastewater composition differed at various sampling period due to internal variations in manufacturing processes and differential disposal of waste products into the influent chamber wastewater composition is tabulated in table 1 the bod cod ratio was in the region of 0 344 0 353 which is considered biodegradable in terms of fbi wastewater the nutrient requirement in terms of bod n ratio was 100 6 which is suitable for aerobic process 2 2 bioreactor components the bioreactor has three components consisting of aerobic unit 10 l anoxic unit 20 l and settling unit 150 l fabricated using a strong polyvinyl pvc sheet the aerobic unit has a circular shape with liquid height inner

sludge was pipe was fixed to the 40 mm pore at the bottom and connected to a recycle pump ceca model qb 60 using pvc pipes the effluent outlet is situated 360 mm from the bottom two transparent perspex glasses with width and height of 250 mm were fitted opposite each other inside the settling unit the diagram of the bioreactor set up is depicted in fig 1 2 3 reactor set up and operation 2 3 1 integrated suspended bioreactor isb the aerobic unit was coupled into the baffle unit the baffle unit containing the aerobic unit was installed in the anoxic unit then the anoxic unit was subsequently installed in the settling unit and occupied a height of 430 mm isb was started using sludge collected from wastewater treatment plant of a food and beverage industry fbi in batu gajah perak malaysia the seed sludge was transferred 3 l and 4 l into the aerobic and anoxic units respectively diluted real beverage wastewater was fed to isb for acclimatization the aerobic unit is a completely mix chamber with one ceramic plate air diffuser at the bottom to produce fine air bubbles in upflow pattern wastewater samples flowed from the aerobic unit into the baffle unit the samples then flowed in upflow pattern toward the filter of the baffle unit where biomass was retained while liquid flowed into the anoxic unit in downflow pattern for nitrate reduction samples then flowed into the settling unit from the anoxic unit this configuration allowed the aerobic unit effluent to serve as the anoxic unit influent thereby eliminating the requirement for external carbon addition the experiments were started after 20 days acclimatization period during which the sludge acclimatized with the wastewater and effluent quality stabilized with cod and ammonia nitrogen removal exceeding 85 real undiluted wastewater was then applied to the system the do concentration in the aerobic unit was supplied using hailea hap 60 air pump at air flowrate of 60 l min 4 5 mg l while the temperature was about 27 2 c the internal effluent recirculation ier was conducted above the sludge bed of the settling unit into the aerobic unit at a ratio of 135 120 108 103 and 100 table 2 to the influent flowrate for the following reasons a to improve the mass transfer of nitrate produced in the aerobic unit during ammonia nitrogen oxidation into the anoxic unit b to dilute the influent load and c to serve as mechanical mixing for the anoxic unit through the periodic wastewater overflow from the baffle unit the ier was kept below 200 at all conditions to prevent the presence of dissolved oxygen in the anoxic unit experimental overall bioreactor hrt table 2 conditions were 36 12 7 2 5 1 and 4 days respectively the hrt conditions of the aerobic unit were 2 0 66 0 4 0 28 and 0 22 days while it was 4 1 33 0 8 0 57 and 0 44 days in the anoxic unit respectively table 2 sludge wasting was conducted at a flowrate of 0 2 0 2 0 25 0 25 and 0 3 l d for the hrt conditions respectively the solid retention time srt at the corresponding hrts was in the region of 33 19 10 1 8 and 6 1 days respectively wastewater was collected from the aerobic anoxic and effluent outlet for analysis every two days the steady state was determined according to the stability of cod and ammonia nitrogen removal within 5 across 4 5 8 10 days sampling period or more and mlvss stability hrt was shortened after each steady state condition by increasing the influent flowrate 2 3 2 integrated hybrid bioreactor ihb the reactor set up and operation in isb was adopted for ihb with some modifications a transparent thermoplastic homopolymer hollow engraved submerged perspex media was installed in the aerobic unit of ihb for biofilm formation diluted real beverage wastewater was fed to ihb for biofilm formation the experiments were started after 30 days acclimatization period during which the biofilm on the submerged media gradually matured and its color changed to brown filamentous bacteria and rotifers were visible within this period the effluent quality stabilized with cod and ammonia nitrogen removal reaching 90 real undiluted wastewater was then applied to the system the experimental conditions are presented in table 2 the overall bioreactor hrts of 36 12 7 2 5 1 and 4 days was achieved by gradually increasing the influent flowrate after each steady state in the range of 5 15 25 35 and 45 l d respectively the internal effluent recirculation ier was conducted above the sludge bed of the settling unit into the aerobic unit for the same purpose in isb at a ratio of 195 180 108 116 and 120 to the influent flowrate furthermore ier ensured that biofilm thickness did not clog the flowthrough holes on the submerged media sludge wasting was conducted at a flowrate of 0 1 0 1 0 15 0 2 and 0 2 l d for the hrt conditions respectively the solid retention time srt at the corresponding hrts was 41 30 22 19 4 and 15 3 days respectively wastewater was collected from the aerobic anoxic and effluent outlet for analysis every two days a similar steady state pattern in isb was adopted in ihb 2 3 3 media design the submerged media was developed based on the process design parameters for nitrification 28 the aerobic unit coefficients and wastewater characteristics was used to obtain the submerged media coefficients the tkn removal in the submerged media was obtained using the relationship between the assumed percent removal influent flowrate and the tkn concentration while the media surface area was determined through the relationship between tkn removal rate and tkn removal the media volume was obtained from the relationship between the surface area of the packing and the specific surface area the media area a was determined through the relationship between the media volume and depth while the hydraulic application rate was then determined from the relationship between the influent flowrate and the submerged media area a the bod loading was determined based on submerged media volume and area the volumetric oxidation rate was determined using the relationship between substrate concentration influent flowrate and media volume the media design procedure is outlined in 28 the design coefficients and submerged media characteristics is presented in table 3 2 3 4 media properties the transparent thermoplastic homopolymer hollow engraved submerged perspex media is represented in fig 2 the submerged media has a rectangular shape and made up of 10 layers held together by a series of detachable vertical plate connectors each layer has 156 pores of 10 mm for the flow of liquid and occupied about 60 of the aerobic unit volume perspex has been widely used for bioreactor fabrication but has been rarely evaluated for biofilm retention the tensile and flexural strength of the submerged media were based on the manufactural specifications the heat deflection temperature density and impact resistance of the submerged media was determined according to astm d648 d792 and d5420 methods respectively all analysis was triplicated and the average reported 2 4 sampling schedule cod ammonia nitrogen nitrate and ph were quantified every two days scod nitrite and tss were quantified at the start and steady state of each hrt phase dissolved oxygen do and temperature were monitored on daily basis suspended and biofilm solids were measured at each steady state 2 5 microfauna assay heterotrophic plate count hpc was used to quantify bacteria abundance while the type of microfauna was identified using leica dm lb2 japan optical microscope connected to a computer system sludge sample from the aerobic unit was collected and immediately homogenized and used for the assay sludge samples were diluted and a specific volume pipetted onto the nutrient medium 3m petrifilm and incubated for 48 h at 35 c identification of the colonies was conducted using a colony counter stuart sc6 operated within the counting range of 25 250 samples were then placed on the glass lid for microscopic observations 2 6 analytical techniques cod and nitrogenous compounds nh4 n no3 n no2 n were determined by hach methods bod5 apha 5210b and tss apha 2540d were determined using standard methods 29 to quantify biomass on the submerged media in ihb the method of liu et al 30 was adopted one layer of the submerged media representing 10 of the entire media was carefully disconnected to quantify biomass the layer was dried for 2 h at 105 c before its mass was determined the biofilm on the layer was quantified by deducting the mass of original layer from the mass of dried layer the obtained biomass concentration on the layer was then correlated with the number of layers on the submerged media at each steady state about 250 ml samples were withdrawn to quantify the suspended solids in isb apha 2540 e 29 ph was monitored using a sension ph meter doc022 9790248 equipped with a reference electrode pt 1000 probe the do concentration and temperature was determined using a do meter and a thermometer respectively analysis of parameters was triplicated for the three sampling ports 2 7 monod kinetic the monod kinetic model was applied to the bioreactor the linearized forms of the model is represented with the expressions 31 1 s o s e x θ h 1 y 1 θ c 1 y k d 2 θ c 1 θ c k d k s μ max 1 s e 1 μ max where s o and s e are the influent and effluent concentrations g l y is the yield coefficient g vss g vss d θ h is the hydraulic retention time d θ c is solid retention time day x is biomass concentration mg l k d is the death rate constant per day k s is the half saturation constant g l and μ max is the maximum specific growth rate per day the yield coefficient y and death rate constant k d can be obtained from the slope and intercept of the plot of s o s e x θ h vs 1 θ c eq 1 while the maximum specific growth rate μ max and the half velocity constant k s could be obtained from the intercept and slope of the plot of q c 1 q c k d vs 1 s e eq 2 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 media analysis the density of the submerged media was obtained as 0 83 g cm3 the average heat deflection temperature was in the range of 77 80 c at 1 8 mpa indicating that the media can withstand temperature up to 80 c without damage or disruption the average impact resistance was obtained as 15 6 ib ft using a striker diameter of about 15 86 mm at room temperature visual examination indicated that the submerged media were free of cracks until a load of 15 6 ib ft above this load a minor crack on the specimen surface was noticed the result shows that the submerged media can withstand high biomass accumulation without deformation or imperfections it has a high surface area durable good liquid diffusion devoid of clogging and appropriate specific weight 3 2 cod degradation acclimatization of isb was rapid as the bioreactor stabilized within a period less than 3 weeks cod concentration was evaluated from the outlet the evolution of cod concentration with time is shown in fig 3 an increasing effluent cod concentration of 38 6 60 90 102 and 124 mg l was obtained with decreasing hrt in the range of 36 12 7 2 5 1 and 4 days respectively this corresponded to cod removal of 98 97 95 94 and 93 respectively the influent wastewater composition periodically fluctuated due to internal process variations this had an impact on isb and caused a slight fluctuation in the treatment process however isb recovered and stabilized effluent cod concentration was higher at short hrt due to incomplete biodegradation this phenomenon was caused by the application of higher organic loading table 2 at short hrt and the inflow of more wastewater into the bioreactor the organic loading rate olr at the long and short hrt conditions of 36 and 4 days were 0 85 and 7 81 kg m3 d 1 in isb respectively this scenario at short hrt could reduce the interaction collision and biodegradation time between the substrate and the microorganisms and cause incomplete biodegradation 32 however effluent cod concentration at short hrt in this study was low suggesting that the reactor configuration enhanced the collision between bacteria and substrate higher effluent cod concentrations of 1090 1480 1900 2200 2500 and 3800 mg l have been reported at hrts of 943 4 86 2 26 7 12 5 11 06 and 7 80 days in a membrane anaerobic reactor mar treating sewage sludge 33 isb demonstrated a stable cod removal capacity exceeding 92 at all hrt conditions higher decrease of cod removal from 90 to 68 has been reported when hrt was decreased from 17 to 9 h in a sequencing batch reactor treating saline wastewater 34 this stability in isb was due to several factors including high c n ratio of the industrial wastewater compactness of the bioreactors which improved collision between microorganism and pollutants and f m ratio 35 evaluation of biodegradation in various units shows that cod removal in the aerobic unit was higher than the anoxic unit higher cod removal in the aerobic unit could be attributed to organic matter oxidation to co2 h2o and biomass in the presence of oxygen as electron acceptor oxidation of organic matter releases energy required for cell maintenance and synthesis when the substrate in the aerobic unit is exhausted endogenous respiration begins this phenomenon allows microorganism to prey on their own cytoplasm for survival this observations are in consonance with that of del pozo and diez 36 who reported a cod removal of 96 2 6 and 1 2 in the aerobic anoxic and methanogenic units of an anaerobic aerobic bioreactor the basic mechanisms responsible for high cod removal in isb is organic matter oxidation which released energy for cell synthesis and maintenance as well as endogenous respiration 2 in ihb biofilm formation was rapid and visible during the acclimatization the degradation efficiency effluent quality and the impact of hrt on ihb was similar to isb biofilm formation caused a swift cod reduction with decreasing hrt as shown in fig 3 cod effluent concentration was 15 30 51 72 and 85 mg l with decreasing hrt in the range of 36 12 7 2 5 1 and 4 days respectively cod removal was in the range of 99 96 2 97 95 and 95 with decreasing hrt the variations and fluctuation of the influent wastewater did not disrupt the system operation ihb achieved higher cod removal efficiency lower effluent concentration and higher system stability higher degradation capacity of ihb arises from surface colonization of the submerged media by biofilm which enhanced organic matter oxidation furthermore ihb benefited from the co existence of suspended and attached bacteria within the reactor inclusion of the submerged media in the bioreactor provoked large biofilm formation and increased biomass quantity this improved microbial immobilization reduced biomass washout retained higher bacteria population and reduced pollutant toxicity 27 biofilm that grow on the inert materials ingest minuscule microbial flocs and colloidal particles 18 while the presence of slow growing nitrifiers shielded the biofilm from biomass washout 16 and enhanced the oxidation of the slowly biodegradable compounds in the wastewater additionally the submerged media improved the stability of the bioreactor to resist shock loading and tolerate higher organic loading at short hrt it was clear that the biofilm on the submerged media in ihb exhibited higher metabolic activity and stability than their suspended counterparts in isb organic loading rate olr largely increased at short hrt and slightly caused an increase of cod effluent concentration the olr at long and short hrt of 36 and 4 days were 2 07 and 26 kg m3 d 1 in ihb however activities of biofilm in ihb were not disrupted due to the influence of the submerged media and the bioreactor structure 3 3 nitrogenous compounds the time course profile for ammonia nitrogen removal is presented in fig 4 ammonia nitrogen removal capacity in isb and ihb differed in isb the influent ammonia load gradually increased with decreasing hrt the influent ammonia load at hrts of 36 12 and 7 2 were in the range of 5 7 35 3 g m3 d 1 ammonia removal efficiency was still high and reached 77 94 however further decrease of hrt to 4 days 50 4 64 g m3 d 1 caused a notable decrease of ammonia removal efficiency to 65 ammonia nitrogen removal in the aerobic unit was high and reached 58 80 with decreasing hrt while it was 6 9 within the anoxic unit the effluent ammonia nitrogen concentration increased in the range of 0 3 4 5 mg l with decreasing hrt notably higher effluent nitrate concentration was recorded at the start of each hrt but gradually decreased to lower levels toward steady state this high initial effluent nitrate concentration was caused by the oxidation of ammonia nitrogen to nitrite and nitrate at steady state effluent nitrate concentration was 0 2 1 4 mg l with decreasing hrt a similar low effluent nitrite concentration was observed table 4 indicating that autotrophic oxidation was responsible for ammonia elimination within the bioreactor in ihb higher ammonia nitrogen oxidation stability was noted the influent ammonia load at hrts of 36 12 7 2 5 1and 4 days were 17 7 58 5 99 2 143 4 and 186 g m3 d 1 this high load did not cause any significant disruption of the submerged media activities although ammonia removal efficiency decreased from 92 71 with decreasing hrt ihb achieved ammonia removal exceeding 70 at all conditions ammonia nitrogen oxidation in the aerobic unit was high and reached 60 82 while it was low 6 17 in the anoxic unit the low ammonia nitrogen oxidation in the anoxic unit could represent an uptake in microbial growth the effluent ammonia nitrogen concentration in ihb was 0 65 0 91 2 12 3 1 and 3 3 mg l with decreasing hrt these values are lower than those from isb indicating that ihb demonstrated higher ammonia nitrogen oxidation capacity ihb maintained a stable ammonia nitrogen oxidation at the start of each hrt with slight fluctuation clearly lower than those in isb this stability largely caused by the accumulation of higher microbial population on the submerged media improved the effluent nitrate quality although effluent nitrate concentration increased at the start of each hrt ihb maintained lower nitrate levels of 0 2 0 6 mg l at steady state high effluent nitrate concentration at the start of each hrt was caused by ammonia oxidation this indicated that nitrate was the major ammonia metabolite in the reactor in line with low nitrate levels nitrite levels were low table 4 indicating occurrence of nitrification in ihb ihb demonstrated higher load tolerance and stability compared to isb in both isb and ihb the major processes responsible for high ammonia nitrogen removal in the aerobic unit were nitrification which is the biological decomposition of ammonia nitrogen to nitrite and nitrate by a set of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and denitrification which is the microbial degradation of nitrate to a gaseous form by a set of nitrate oxidizing bacteria nob 2 37 this biological decomposition of ammonium compounds encourages microbial cell synthesis the decrease of ammonia nitrogen removal with decreasing hrt could be due to the alteration of the dynamic balance of microorganisms at higher hydraulic loading which causes incomplete biodegradation 38 a similar ammonia nitrogen removal trend of 89 4 75 70 6 and 62 3 was noted by jin and zheng 39 with decreasing hrt in the range of 10 1 8 33 6 82 and 5 52 h respectively in a high rate anammox upflow filter the composition of microorganisms on the submerged media can influence the performance of ihb autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria compete for available oxygen nutrient and surface area on biofilm support materials 38 40 when hrt is decreased organic loading increases and cause a competition between heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria within ihb for available food resources slow growing nitrifiers occupy the inner part of the biofilm 40 while ammonia nitrogen removal decreased at short hrt of 4 days in isb and ihb it was more pronounced in isb indicating that biofilm nitrifying capacity was higher throughout the study this observation is in agreement with other studies 14 3 4 ihb product analysis evaluating the failure of a submerged media is necessary to understand its workability nitrogen mass balance was undertaken to highlight the removal mechanism of ammonia and its metabolites by the biofilm communities using the expressions below 3 n nh 3 gi n si n nh 3 go n so 4 n s n h 4 n s n o 2 n s n o 3 n s the error mass balance is expressed as 5 e n i n o n i 100 where g is gas s the solid i the inlet and o is the outlet the inlet ammonia loading in ihb corresponded to 17 7 58 5 99 2 143 4 and 186 g m3 d 1 respectively with decreasing hrt in the mass balance evaluation organic and gaseous nitrogen was obtained by deducting nitrate nitrite and ammonium from the measured total nitrogen in the bioreactor the ammonia mass percentage distribution in ihb is presented in fig 5 results show that over 60 of ammonia applied to ihb was transformed to nitrite and nitrate percentage of ammonia transformation to other species was directly proportional to ammonia loading at long hrt of 36 days 17 7 g m3 d 1 the major ammonia metabolite in the bioreactor was nitrate nitrate percentage gradually decreased with shortening hrt and was lowest at hrt of 4 days 186 g m3 d 1 this observation indicates that nitrification was the major ammonia elimination mechanism in ihb however while nitrate percentage decreased nitrite percentage gradually increased with reducing hrt this could indicate the toxification and inhibition of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob at higher loading free ammonia fa can inhibit nitrification depending on the total nitrogen species concentration temperature and ph fa exerts inhibitory effect on nitrosomonas at a concentration of 10 150 mg l and 0 1 1 0 mg l for nitrobacter 41 low fa values of 1 7 2 4 mg l in ihb indicate that the conversion of nitrite to nitrate by nitrobacter was slightly inhibited by ammonia however the inhibition was minimal due to the manipulative increase of influent wastewater which reduced the interference the total nitrogen analysis indicated an increasing ammonium concentration ammonium concentration increased relative to influent load and reached 30 at short hrt of 4 days 186 g m3 d 1 however ihb maintained ammonia removal exceeding 70 at the highest nitrogen loading nitrogen loss could be attributed to organic nitrogen released from leached biomass and gaseous nitrogen the percentage of organic and gaseous nitrogen ogn was low 1 2 4 indicating that nitrification occurred without the creation of anaerobic zone within the submerged media a mass balance error of 3 1 4 56 were obtained with decreasing hrt the unaccounted nitrogen metabolites within the bioreactor could contribute to nitrogen error in this study this observation is consistent with other studies 42 the loss in nitrogen mass balance could indicate that ammonia was transformed into metabolites other than nitrite and nitrate only organic nitrogen from the biomass and gaseous nitrogen were two metabolites not considered gaseous nitrogen is produced through denitrification in the anaerobic zone of the submerged media when nitrite and nitrate is reduced subject to the mass balance the submerged media demonstrated the capacity to operate at long period and at high loading 3 5 ph evaluation the profile of ph evolution in isb and ihb is represented in fig 6 the effluent ph of isb and ihb were near similar but significantly fluctuated during the study the influent ph was in the region of 4 7 5 3 but only reached 7 03 in two sampling occasions in isb the effluent ph was in the region of 7 5 8 9 while it was about 7 09 8 4 in ihb the ph value in both bioreactors fluctuated but was in the optimum range of microbial metabolic activities for organic matter oxidation and nitrification denitrification processes several mechanisms can influence fluctuation of effluent ph in isb and ihb during nitrification alkalinity is consumed in the aerobic unit the decrease of ph value in isb and ihb was caused by alkalinity consumption during nitrification 43 44 however at the end of nitrification ph values increased due to the termination of alkalinity consumption co2 stripping and substrate depletion 45 46 therefore the ph fluctuations was due to decomposition of fermentation products during organic matter bio oxidation alkalinity consumption during nitrification termination of alkalinity consumption after nitrification transfer of the accumulated co2 in the mixed liquor of the aerobic unit during nitrification into the anoxic unit during denitrification and alkalinity recovery after denitrification 44 46 a similar observation was made by ruiz et al 47 who noted that optimum ph levels for nitrification was between 6 45 to 8 95 thus isb and ihb operated within the optimum ph range 3 6 solids evaluation table 4 shows the biomass concentration in isb and ihb biomass concentration was directly influenced by hrt in this study when hrt is increased organic loading rate and food to microorganisms f m ratio decrease table 2 as the hrt is decreased organic loading rate and f m ratio increases at low f m ratios the amount of substrate in the bioreactor is low and insufficient to maintain microbial growth causing endogenous respiration of microorganisms residues left from endogenous metabolism primarily consist of cell capsules which are very light 48 mlvss reached a higher level table 4 when hrt was reduced due to higher substrate loading applied at shorter hrt at shorter hrt organic loading olr and food to microorganisms f m ratio was higher compared to longer hrt table 2 this implies that more oxidizable substrates which can enhance microbial growth were available to microorganisms within the bioreactors at shorter hrt furthermore substrate removal rate r ssr increased with decreasing hrt in both isb and ihb reaching 7 81 and 24 7 kg m3 d 1 at hrt of 4 days table 2 respectively clearly the maximum loading rate was not attained in both isb and ihb it is well known that the substrate removal rate r ssr decreases when the maximum loading rate is attained the mlvss rapidly built up at the start of each hrt run but slowed down with time the mlvss was not absolutely constant but fluctuated around a mean value and finally attained stabilization state toward the end of study at the start of each hrt run microorganisms were provided with unlimited food and oxygen which caused the bacteria to dwell in the exponential growth phase while the mlvss increased substrate was depleting due to microbial consumption and became limiting causing bacteria to enter endogenous phase the mlvss concentration at the long and short hrt of 36 and 4 days were 2 67 and 4 7 g l in isb and 3 3 and 17 3 g l in ihb respectively a similar observation was made by sun et al 49 who evaluated the influence of three hrt conditions of 6 12 and 24 h on the behavior of submerged membrane bioreactor the authors found that mlss was higher at shorter hrt of 6 h huang et al 50 evaluated the influence of hrt and srt on submerged anaerobic membrane bioreactor treating low strength wastewater and found that at a fixed srt of 30 days and hrt conditions of 12 10 and 8 h mlvss concentration increased in the range of 5132 6352 and 6500 mg l respectively a similar trend was observed when srt was varied diez et al 48 noted that mlvss concentration increased in the range of 3 3 3 6 3 8 and 4 9 g l with decreasing hrt in the range of 16 12 10 and 8 h respectively the authors noted that further decrease of hrt to 7 6 5 and 4 5 h and at higher organic loading rate olr mlvss decreased in the range of 4 5 4 4 3 5 and 3 3 g l the disparity between mlvss concentrations of isb and ihb was due to their inhabitation environment microorganisms which attach on the surface of inert media have faster growth rate than the suspended counterpart due to their exposure to available food resources effluent tss concentration in isb and ihb was low table 4 indicating good biodegradability capacity of the bioreactors the submerged media in ihb could serve as an entrapment filter for suspended solids 40 both isb and ihb demonstrated good solid separation capabilities and high settling capacity 3 7 microfauna assay microbial abundance and diversity was evaluated in both isb and ihb the bioreactor stability and conformity was monitored through the presence of microfauna species protozoans and metazoans are known indicators of system stability in activated sludge 51 in isb and ihb protozoans were primarily dominant making up over 80 of the total microfauna abundance in each bioreactor both bioreactors displayed near similar abundance of protozoans and metazoans protozoans such as free swimmers and attached ciliates were found in both isb and ihb however crawling ciliates were found only in ihb ciliates are predators and fundamentally influence activated sludge processes ciliates are bio indicators of activated sludge activities due to their ability to respond to alterations in wastewater composition and operating conditions 52 similarly metazoans such as rotifers and nematodes were dominantly found in isb and ihb microfauna variation and diversity was observed at different stages of the study during acclimatization free swimmers were dominantly present within isb and ihb after acclimatization attached ciliates were found in isb while both ciliates crawling and attached were found in ihb nematodes rapidly disappeared but reappeared in low quantities at short hrt while rotifer population increased this observation is consistent with literature 53 this microbial biodiversity at different experimental stage could be attributed to substrate gradient and operating conditions 54 during substrate depletion free swimmers disappear due to their inability to compete for available scarce substrate within the bioreactor however attached ciliates and metazoans has the capacity to survive under conditions of famine while favorably competing for the depleted substrate and living as predator on other bacteria 55 rotifers are primary metazoans found in biological wastewater treatment and they are considered predators due to their capacity to ingest large quantities of bacteria and suspended particles when rotifers consume dispersed and unflocculated bacteria they encourage cell replacement and improve effluent quality 56 thus the rotifers in isb and ihb contributed to the stability of the bioreactors the increase in number of microorganisms after acclimatization suggests that the microorganisms were convenient within their environment these protozoans and metazoans are predators and can feed on bacteria and suspended particles while improving flocculation the microfauna abundance and biodiversity found in this study indicates that both isb and ihb were operating at good condition 57 effective activated sludge systems are characterized with large quantity of microfauna species and biodiversity the presence of high amount of ciliate species in a bioreactor implies an adequate bod biodegradation and high effluent clarity 3 8 monod kinetic the kinetic plot is shown in fig 7 the y k d μ max and k s for isb were obtained as 0 118 g vss g cod 0 04 per day 0 635 per day and 3 93 g m3 with a correlation coefficient r 2 of 0 988 respectively while in ihb it was 0 1 g vss g cod 0 02 per day 0 81 per day and 1 26 g m3 with a correlation coefficient r 2 of 0 978 respectively the obtained kinetic coefficients was in close agreement with the report of işik and sponza 58 who obtained a y k d μ max and k s values of 0 125 g vss g cod 1 0 0065 per day 0 105 per day and 4000 mg l respectively the values of k s determines the affinity between microorganisms and substrate 59 the k s values in this study indicate that the affinity between the microorganisms and the substrate was higher in ihb than isb the variations in the kinetic values have been attributed to wastewater characteristics type of microorganisms and reactor configuration 4 conclusion an integrated hybrid bioreactor ihb was used for industrial wastewater treatment ihb was compared with an integrated suspended bioreactor isb both bioreactors demonstrated high industrial wastewater treatment capacity at all experimental conditions cod removal was higher and more stable than ammonia nitrogen removal implying that the microorganisms within the bioreactors have a higher preference for carbon than nitrogen ihb was more stable than isb due to higher biomass accumulation on the submerged media in the aerobic unit this study can conclude as follows i acclimatization period of isb and ihb was short due to the compactness of the bioreactor which promoted higher contact between pollutant and microorganisms ii inclusion of the hollow engraved submerged media in ihb enhanced bioreactor performance by retaining higher microbial population iii microfauna species and biodiversity within isb and ihb support our findings that the bioreactor was stable throughout the study iv isb and ihb can be used for industrial wastewater treatment and other wastewaters particularly in areas where land is rare or costly v in furtherance of cost reduction application of real time control techniques can enhance the uniqueness of isb and ihb acknowledgments this study was supported by universiti teknologi petronas utp universiti teknologi malaysia utm provided technical support we are grateful to utp and utm

coagulation flocculation mechanism and on the flocculating capacity to remove cu ii keywords anionic grafting cellulose reverse microemulsion coagulation flocculation colloidal particles heavy metal 1 introduction with the enormous global market demand for cellulosic fibers estimated at usd 37 billion in 2020 1 cellulose chemistry has become a global priority of the modern economy in comparison with the economic market of synthetic diamond which will not exceed usd 29 billion in 2023 2 cellulose and its derivatives have become the suitable to be the primary chemical resource of modern industry where it currently dominates the second priority of the european bioeconomy 3 indicating that the exploitation of cellulose and its derivatives is a global issue in economic and environmental terms cellulose is the most abundant biodegradable renewable and biocompatible natural polymer 4 since its typical and unique chemical structure resulting from the high density of hydrogen bonds 5 6 confers it a high structural stability limiting its direct application in many industrial areas moreover its insolubility in common solvents except that in complex expensive and toxic solvent systems 7 12 is the major obstacle to homogenous modification process 13 in addition the thermal modification is remote because of its degradation before reaching the melting state then some considerable efforts over the last decades have pushed towards new classes of solvents such as ionic solvents 14 20 des 21 27 and ndes 28 31 which showed great efficiency in solvating the cellulose but still remain expensive toxic in some conditions 32 33 indeed it was found that an increase in length of the alkyl chain in 1 alkyl 3 methylimidazolium salts increases the toxicity and can even lead to substances more toxic than methanol 34 36 and the second drawback that observed is the biodegradability decrease 37 various anionic cationic and nonionic cellulose based flocculants have been synthesized in order to replace those based on synthetic current polymer for water treatment 34 36 38 44 medical and pharmaceutical industries 45 49 yongbo song et al studied the flocculating properties of cellulose grafted am monomer amc in the urea naoh aqueous medium the results reported that the flocculating capacity of the colloidal fe oh 3 particles increases over time reaction promoting the saponification of amide groups into carboxylate form 50 in addition polyacrylamide grafted polyvinyl pyrollidone pvp g pam showed a good flocculation efficacy in coal fine suspension and in destabilization of aqueous suspension of nanoparticles multi walled carbon nano tubes without and in presence of other ions 51 in the same way gum tragacanth grafted poly of diallyldimethylammonium chloride gt g p dadmac enhanced the water solubility and functionality of gt which showed a high efficacy as a flocculant in model aqueous suspensions of kaolin and multi walled carbon nano tubes mwcnt through standard jar test procedure 52 the copolymers of polyacrylamide and carboxymethyl cellulose in aqueous alcohol medium using a ceric ion initiator and batch polymerization was successfully prepared by okieimen and tested their efficacy as flocculant against kaolin suspension 53 hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate hpmcp has been used as a flocculant for the recovery of silver from industrial wastewater 54 the xanthates derivatives of cellulose showed also a good flocculation efficiency for calcite and chrysocolla 55 the cellulosic ether derivatives such as hydroxypropyl cellulose hpc and hydroxyethyl cellulose hec have been widely used as intermediate water soluble cellulosic polymer to prepare new classes of functional materials indeed ce iv induced free radical polymerization was used by ahmed a et al to prepare ph sensitive interpenetrating network ipn microspheres mps by emulsion crosslinking method using glutaraldehyde ga as a crosslinking agent 56 the swelling behavior in water of hpc graft copolymerized with acrylamide aam using benzoyl peroxide as the initiator and crosslinked with glutaraldehyde was also studied 57 while the removal of heavy metals from aquatic environments by flocculation using modified cellulosic ethers is poorly discussed in literature in this paper a new water soluble cellulosic derivative hecc was successfully elaborated and investigated as an effective anionic coagulant flocculant for colloidal systems fe oh 3 and to remove heavy metal ions cu ii from aquatic environments hecc was successfully synthesized via an unconventional reverse microemulsion process using water as ecofriendly solvent and as hydrogen transfer agent where cyclohexane was employed as continuous phase to reduce the hydrophobicity of the medium the grafting reaction of am was followed by an alkali saponification reaction removing an amount of ammonia trapped by boric acid solution and quantified by volumetric dosage using tashiro indicator the saponification reaction showed an important increase in the negative charge density where the zeta potential value of hecc reached 45 mv the proposed structure effect of grafting process on the crystalline order morphological changes and the elementary composition were studied using ftir 1h 13c nmr deept 135 xrd and sem edx respectively the new hecc flocculant showed a high flocculation capacity to fe oh 3 colloidal system at 35 μl as added volume of 1 flocculant solution furthermore the ph variation was investigated to show its effect on the coagulation flocculation mechanism and on the flocculating capacity to remove cu ii from aqueous solution to our knowledge based on a literature review hecc has never been discussed before on the synthesis side and synthesis method either for application as coagulant flocculant colloidal systems or for the removal of heavy metals hecc was successfully developed as a novel water treatment agent with high coagulation flocculation efficiency non toxicity low cost eco friendly and promising candidates for industrial applications 2 experimental and methods 2 1 materials hec ds 1 5 of 95 purity was obtained from himedia company and dissolution precipitation method in water acetone solvents was used for its purification am c3h5no cyclohexane c6h12 copper nitrate cu no3 2 and iron chloride fecl3 were purchased from sigma aldrich all other chemicals and solvents were obtained from fluka company and were used without further purification 2 2 methods 2 2 1 instrumental analysis the chemical structures of hec hecac and hecc samples were characterized using fourier transform infrared ftir technique the spectra were recorded on shimadzu ftir 8400s spectrometer using a finely ground kbr pellets with 2 of the sample at a resolution of 2 cm 1 an average of 40 scans were taken for each sample and recorded from 4000 to 400 cm 1 1h and 13c nmr measurements were carried on a brukeravance 400 mhz spectrometer at 360 k using tms as internal standard dmso d 6 and d2o were used as solvent for hec and hecc respectively approximately 10 mg of hec was dissolved in 1 ml dmso d 6 and 2 drops of tfa were added to displace the h2o peaks in the case of 13c nmr for the both samples hec and hecc approximately 50 mg of sample was dissolved in 1 ml of dmso d 6 or d2o without tfa for each sample approximately 14 000 scans and a d1 of 2 s were required the sample crystallinity was evaluated using x ray diffraction technique and was performed on an x ray diffractometer equinox 2000 using copper radiation cuk α λ 1 5418 a at an accelerating voltage of 40 kv and an operating current of 30 ma all patterns were recorded in the range of 2θ 5 35 0 25 g of each sample is pressed under 50 mpa to form pellets of 25 mm in average diameter thermal behaviors of hec hecar and hecc samples were performed using thermogravimetric analysis tga on a shimadzu dtg 60 simultaneous dta tg apparatus the sample weight was between 8 and 12 mg two scans were run from room temperature to 500 c at a rate of10 c min 1under nitrogen purge 50 ml min 1 the evolution of the surface morphologies and the microstructures of samples were investigated before and after modification using scanning electron microscopy tescan vega iii lm with an accelerating voltage of 10 kv moreover energy dispersive x ray analyzer edax was employed for profiling the different elements present on the polymer surfaces the zeta potential ζ conductivity and electrophoretic mobility as a function of ph ph 2 11 of hec and hecc in milli q water at 0 1 of each sample were measured using zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments at 25 0 1 c 2 2 2 coagulation flocculation of colloidal ferric hydroxide solution fe oh 3 ferric hydroxide colloidal system fe oh 3 is prepared by the hydrolysis of saturated solution of ferric chloride fe cl 3 with boiling distilled water the fe cl 3 solution was added drop wise to the boiling water until the obtaining of a brilliant dark red colloidal solution appeared the coagulation flocculation study was carried out by adding 10 200 μl of an aqueous solution of hecc 1 to 5 mlof saturated fe oh 3 colloidal solution then the transmittance of the surnageant for each added volume of flocculant solution is measured using uv 1800 uv vis shimadzu spectrophotometer resolution of 1 nm between 500 and 600 nm 2 2 3 cu ii removal capacity the coagulation flocculation capacity cfc of hec and hecc samples for the removal of cu ii metal ion was studied using 2 ml of flocculant aqueous solution at 0 5 and 10 ml of aqueous metal ion the metal ion concentration ranges from 100 to 800 mg l 1 and the ph value varied from 2 to 8 the ph of the different solutions was adjusted by adding different concentrations of hcl or naoh indeed the metal ion concentrations of the supernatant were determined by atomic absorption measurements using flame atomic absorption faa thermoscienific ice3000 type ice3500aa system and the fcc qe mg g 1 was evaluated by the following equation eq 1 1 q e c 0 c e v m where c0 is the initial concentration of metal ion mg l 1 ce is the metal ion equilibrium concentration of metal ion mg l 1 m is the mass of hecc g and v is the volume of the solution l 2 2 4 preparation of hecc hecc sample was obtained by anionic grafting of am on hydroxyethylcellulose hec by reverse microemulsion water cyclohexane followed by alkali saponification of amide groups to carboxylate form since 1 g 13 87 mmol of am was added to 1 g 4 38 mmol 13 16 mmol oh of alkoxylated hec in 7 ml of naoh 1 n solution the mixture was kept under stirring at room temperature until a transparent solution appeared then 15 ml 2 3 of cyclohexane c6h12 were added to the mixture under stirring and heated at 60 c for 2 h then the mixture was neutralized using ethanolic hcl solution and the hecac was precipitated in a large excess of cold ethanol filtered under vacuum and washed with cold ethanol frequently then it was stocked in a desiccator in the presence of p2o5 for one week the saponification 1 g of hecac to hecc was carried out in naoh 4 n solution for 12 h fig 1 3 results and discussions the new cellulosic derivative hecc as a new low cost biodegradable and ecofriendly coagulant flocculant of positive charged particles such as colloidal systems fe oh 3 and heavy metal ions cu ii was successfully prepared by anionic grafting of am on hec using reverse microemulsion water cyclohexane in the first step hec alkoxylation was carried out in naoh 1 n solution creating anionic sites alkoxide at the polymer surface 58 which initiate the grafting reaction by nucleophilic attack of the double bond of am fig 1 generally the reaction of a nucleophilic center with monomers having π system in their molecular structures allows to their anionic polymerization for this reason the water was used on one hand as ecofriendly solvent and on the other hand as a hydrogen transfer agent to avoid the formation of polyacrylamide on the hec main chain which can limit its aqueous solubility however the grafting of hec with acrylamide increases at a certain level the hydrophobicity to the resulting derivative consequently its solubility in the aqueous medium was reduced then the reactivity of hec and consequently low degree of substitution values is expected at this stage cyclohexane was introduced to reduce the hydrophobicity and to increase the solubility and consequently the reactivity of hec 3 1 structural analysis 3 1 1 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir fig 2 a and b shows the ftir spectra of am hec hecac and hecc respectively the absorption characteristic band of the oh elongations is located around 3400 cm 1 and those detected at 2920 2881 cm 1 are attributed to the symmetric and asymmetric ch vibrations the deformation vibration characterizing the natural absorbed water in hec structure fig 2a is localized at 1640 cm 1 4 13 58 the grafting of acrylamide on hec was justified by the appearance of a new absorption band at1672 cm 1 characterizing carbonyl amide co amide on the hecac spectrum fig 2a also the appearance of a new absorption bands overlapped by oh bands at 3223 cm 1 attributed to the vibrations of the amide nh2 indicates the success of the grafting reaction 59 in addition the effect of the reaction medium alkalinity on the saponification of amide groups to carboxylate form was confirmed by the appearance of a new absorption band at 1566 cm 1 attributed to the carbonyl of the carboxylate moreover the comparison of the peak intensities at 1672 cm 1 and at 1566 cm 1 shows that the amide groups attached to hec backbone are predominant in the cellulosic polymer the absence of the absorption band characteristic of the π binding cc at 1614 cm 1 indicates that hecac obtained is free of any residual product 60 61 in relation with the applications envisaged the negative charge on the hecc surface is ensured by the saponification reaction allowing the conversion of the amide groups to the carboxylate form this total conversion is justified by the total disappearance of the absorption bands of the group and by a notable increase of the characteristic absorption band of carboxylate carbonyl vibrations at 1568 cm 1 fig 2b furthermore trapping of the ammonia released by boric acid solution allows following the saponification reaction in the presence of the tashiro indicator and was titrated with hcl solution this typical dosage gives the different values of ds reported in table 1 1h and 13c and dept 135 nmr measurements were carried out using dmso d 6 and d2o as solvent for hec and hecc respectively in the case of hec tfa was added to dmso d 6 to displace the h2o proton signals the d2owas used as solvent to avoid the overlap of am methylene signals in hecc with those of dmso fig 3 a and b shows 1h 13c and dept 135 nmr spectra of hec in dmso d 6 tfa a and hecc in d2o b in fig 3a the signals of the methylene protons on α of different hydroxyl groups are located at 3 6 ppm and those attached to the carbon c6 of the cellulose backbone gives some signals at around 3 5 ppm the broad ring proton signals of the cellulose skeleton are recorded from 2 8 to 5 6 ppm moreover the typical carbon signals of hec methylene fig 3a were detected from 60 7 to 72 7 ppm and the peaks assigned to the carbons of cellulose main chains are located in the game of 60 105 ppm 4 13 58 the 1h nmr spectrum of the hecc sample fig 3b shows the recording of new signals at 2 43 ppm and 3 69 ppm which are attributed to the methylene proton resonances of the grafted acrylate moieties 1 and 3 respectively furthermore the chemical shifts distribution of the carbons in the hecc sample fig 3b gives the evidence of the grafting reaction by the detection of new peaks attributed to the sp3 carbons of the grafted acrylate entities 1 and 3 at 37 77 ppm and 67 71 ppm the significant peak located at 180 04 ppm 7 was assigned to the quaternary carbon of carboxylate form 62 38 63 and the absence of a further signal in this area characterizing quaternary carbon is a strong indication of the total saponification process amide carboxylate however the persistence of the peak at 60 54 ppm on the 13c nmr spectrum of hecc indicates that there is still a partial amount of unmodified primary alcohols hydroxyl group where a ds value less than 1 5 can be expected 4 13 58 dept 135 spectrum of hecc fig 3b confirms the investigation of the structural changes in the hec structure indeed the resonance signals of the cellulosic carbons c1 c2 c3 c4 and c5 change the orientation by 180 whereas the signal at 180 04 ppm 7 disappeared indicating its quaternary character where the methylene protons signals ch2 kept their orientation the ds value was calculated using the integration of specific proton signals and it was estimated at 1 in addition the absence of the proton and the carbon signals of polyacrylamide is a good indication of hydrogen transfer and that the polymerization of am was avoided these results show that the grafting reaction was successfully performed and the hecc sample is free of any residual product 3 2 scanning electron microscopy fig 4 shows sem images and edax spectra of hec hecac and hecc unmodified hec displayed a morphology consisting of agglomerated particles the aggregates thus observed were discontinuously cemented between each other these morphological entities resulted from the high density of hydrogen bonds that forms the predominant type of intra and interchain interactions in hec structure the introduction of the amide groups in the hec backbone hecac causes a significant variation in the crystal order of the polymer structure therefore continuous morphology where the agglomerations disappear and this result is confirmed by xrd after saponification of hecac the hecc microstructure has agglomerated again and this can be attributed to the decreasing in the density of the hydrogen bonds moreover the increase of o c atomic ratio and the appearance of na peak on the edx spectrum of hecc is strong indication of that the grafting reaction was successfully occurred then the polymer surface becomes more anionic and enhances its solubility in aqueous medium and its ability to interact with positive charged particles such as heavy metals and colloidal systems 3 3 x ray diffraction and thermal analysis fig 5 a shows the xrd diffractograms of acrylamide hec and hecac the xrd diffractograms of microcrystalline cellulose and hecac are presented in fig 5b fig 5a demonstrates that the amorphous aspect of hec disappeared after the introduction of acrylamide entities into its structure and a new crystalline order appeared on hecac xrd diffractogram this phenomenon results from substitution of oh by a new group leading to a change in the arrangement and the density of hydrogen bonds in hec indeed fig 5b shows that the new lattice planes characterized by bragg angles 2θ 14 20 17 02 18 70 and 25 84 is similar to that of microcrystalline cellulose with a clear shift to small 2θ angle where the intercalation of the macromolecular chains as effect of grafting reaction will be suggested at supramolecular level the success of the experimental approach is also proven by a notable destruction of the crystalline order of am 64 the thermal behavior of hec hecac and hecc are shown in fig 5c the thermograms show two phases of mass loss the first is located at around 100 c that is attributed to the loss of solvents and to the absorbed moisture while the second seat of loss of mass is observed between 240 and 250 c and which corresponds to the temperature of the thermal degradation of the three cellulosic polymers this result shows that the modification whether by amide groups or by carboxylates does not influence the thermal stability of hecac and hecc in comparison with hec 65 3 4 zeta potential electrophoretic mobility and conductivity zeta potential measurements are used to evaluate the surface charge density of polymers the dependence of the zeta potential on ph was investigated and fig 6 shows the effect of the incorporation of carboxylate entities in the hec surface taking into account the ph values so no important effect of the ph on zeta potential was noted the electrophoretic mobility and conductivity were measured for hec and the values of those parameters remain zero throughout the ph range studied which is acceptable and in accordance with the uncharged structure of hec the potentiometric behavior of hecc awakens three stages of variation of zeta potential according to the ph values the first stage was recorded in the range of ph from 2 to 5 showing a progressive increase in the value of zeta potential from 0 to 20 mv indicating the deprotonation of carboxylic function leading to the carboxylate form the second one describes a sharp decrease of zeta potential from ph 5 to ph 7 to reaching a limit value around 45 mv and indicating a complete deprotonation of the carboxylic functions above neutral ph the value of zeta potential remains constant justifying the stability of the charge density at the level of the polymer surface the electrophoretic mobility is proportional to the surface charge density and zeta potential so it can be useful to confirm the variation obtained in the zeta potential value it s worth noticing the similarity between the variation of zeta potential and electrophoretic mobility is clearly noted fig 6 the study of electrical behavior using conductivity as a function of ph confirmed the results obtained from zeta potential and electrophoretic mobility where a decrease in the conductivity of the aqueous hecc solution between ph 2 and ph 5 is a strong indication that the saponification reaction of the acid function was occurred in addition the point of intersection of the two lines of the variation of the conductivity is found between ph 5 and ph 7 indicating the neutralization of the acidic form at the hecc surface from ph7 the change of the conductivity curve orientation as a function of ph towards a positive slope proves the total consumption of the carboxylic functions and the alkalinity of the medium increases its conductivity 3 5 application 3 5 1 coagulation flocculation of colloidal systems fe oh3 the insoluble colloidal particles of ferric hydroxide were prepared by hydrolysis reaction of fecl3 where the positive charge characterizing their colloidal surface is due to the ionization of the hydroxyl groups of the fe oh 3colloidal particles and the hydrochloric acid produced during the hydrolysis was removed by heating to avoid destabilization and coagulation of colloidal system the presence of the opposite charge given by hecc destabilizes the colloidal system to avoid the repulsion of colloidal particles and therefore coagulation flocculation and clarification of the solution were observed the coagulation flocculation of colloidal fe oh 3 solution by hecc was studied according to the added volume of flocculant solution and the results were illustrated on fig 7 where the ph of the system was fixed betweenph6 and ph7 as the optimal value corresponding to the total deprotonation of carboxylic entities grafted on hec backbone on the other hand the phpzc point of zero charge of fe oh 3 is largely discussed in literature and is determined at 8 5 value 66 so optimizing the ph value between 6 and 7 assured the electrostatic interactions between colloidal particles of fe oh 3 positively charged and the polymer surface of hecc with a negative charge fig 7 shows that the maximum transmittance value 99 was achieved at 35 μl of flocculant solution and then the transmittance of the transparency zone increased progressively by adding more of the flocculant solution in comparison with other flocculants approaching hecc at the structural level yongbo song et al have studied the flocculation capacity of am grafted cellulose ds 0 67 synthesized in the naoh urea h2o system of ferric hydroxide fe oh 3 saturated colloidal solution and the results in the same conditions of this study showed that flocculation was achieved at an optimal dose of 428 mg l 1 which corresponds to flocculant solution 1 w volume of 300 μl 50 however the new flocculant hecc improved the flocculating capacity 10 times with a volume of the flocculating solution of 35 μl also m i khalil and a a aly have shown that the ability of a ferric laurate solution to flocculate transmittance by anionic starch derivatives such as carboxymethyl starch carboxyethyl starch poly acrylic acid starch graft copolymer and starch 2 hydroxypropyl citrate is between 43 and 82 even at optimum dose of flocculant which reaches 125 mg l 1 67 to better understand the coagulation flocculation mechanism of colloidal particles of fe oh 3 system it is necessary to know that the electric charge architecture double electric layer of the colloidal particles is divided into layers of stern and gouy chapman the stern layer electrically associates with a diffuse layer of free ions with an opposite charge gouy chapman layer however the two layers give the particles a characteristic potential called the zeta potential and to destabilize the colloidal system towards coagulation flocculation it is necessary to provide the particles with sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the repulsive energy barrier the destabilization of the colloidal particles can be achieved by the double layer compression mechanism where the thickness of the double layer decreases in relation to the ionic concentration of the system e g metal salt coagulant which causes the decrease of the repulsive effect of diffuse layer until the elimination of the energy barrier 68 72 in addition charge neutralization and bridging mechanisms are widely envisaged in flocculation coagulation process using polymeric systems as alternative coagulants flocculants to overcome the problems associated with the use of inorganic coagulants aluminum and iron based alum 73 80 the latter bridging mechanism is available for very high molecular weight anionic flocculants 3 30 106 g mol 1 with a low charge density which adsorb on more than one particle and the flocculant acts as a bridge and binds several particles to form aggregates 55 however the charge neutralization mechanism is based on zeta potential neutralization where the coagulant flocculant is adsorbed to the colloidal surface causing their electric discharge and reduction of their electrophoretic mobility 81 82 at this stage the neutralized particles can be charged by the positively charged adjacent particles and hence the formation of flocs where both mechanisms can act simultaneously with the excess of polymer there are not enough particle surfaces available for fixation and the particles become destabilized which can cause some electrostatic repulsion ensured by the regular distribution of the carboxylate group along the polymeric chain of flocculent this phenomenon has been observed when the added volume of the flocculant solution exceeds 35 μl as an optimal volume the degree of polymerization dp 220 of hec determined by viscometer allows to estimate the approximate size of the flocculant polymer chain at 71 000 g mol 1 however this low molecular weight value in comparison with the colloidal size indicates the predominance of the charge neutralization mechanism 3 5 2 coagulation flocculation of heavy metal ions cu ii the incorporation of new carboxylate groups in cellulosic structure was extensively studied to improve its physicochemical properties including surface charge and to elaborate a large variety of new heavy metals adsorbents however these modifications remain at the level of the cellulosic surface or by crosslinking limiting the elimination of micro pollutants to electrostatic adsorption on the surface of the adsorbent without reaching the chelating groups in the cellulose polymer core in this paper the homogeneous insertion of the carboxylate groups in the hec main chain giving a new water soluble polymer hecc characterized by a high negative charge density useful in removing metal ions from aquatic environments basing on the flocculation coagulation phenomenon however the flocculation mechanism for removal of heavy metal in ionic form from aquatic environments is widely discussed in the literature using polysaccharide based polymers such as flocculants indeed bingzhi liu et al have studied the role of ionic groups of carboxylate rich magnetic chitosan flocculants on the efficiency and kinetics of removal of heavy metal and cationic dye where the optimal uptake rate was 98 3 and 87 4 and exhibited satisfactory removal effect in wide range ph range 4 0 8 0 for ni ii 5 0 10 0 for mg and mechanism of flocculation has been explained by a rapid initial adsorption performed by the action of the carboxylic groups which forms complexes with the metal ion in which the oxygen donates electrons to metal ions thus the electron density at the adjacent two carbon atoms decreases 83 84 in addition liang wu et al have synthesized an amphoteric starch derivative that was applied as a water soluble polysaccharide ether and effective flocculant for heavy metal ion cu ii and zn ii removal from wastewater in which remove rate for cu ii and zn ii remained at 93 and 91 after three flocculation regeneration cycles and the mechanism of flocculation was explained by the extent of negatively charged flocculant and heavy metal cations 85 in the same sense l liu et al have proposed the same mechanism explained by chemisorption chelation of metal ions and charge neutralization which facilitated bridge adsorption by p am dmdaac polymer chains to form large floccules 86 also yongjun sun et al have studied the application of the new chitosan based flocculants as good ph resistance and high heavy metals removal capacity where the mechanism of flocculation was attributed firstly to the phenomenon of chelation flocculation where the metal ions are chelated by the carboxylic groups negatively charged this alters the electrostatic polymer behavior that leads to the charge and bridging mechanism 87 whereas the effect of the flocculant dose plays an early role in the flocculation mechanism where the optimal dose causes adsorption mechanisms bridging and seep flocculation 88 generally the flocculation of heavy metals by water soluble polymeric flocculants is attributed according to numerous recent studies to the chelation and trapping of the metal ion by chelating groups which are present on the polymer chain followed by a neutralization of charge and adsorption bridging and seep flocculation to form the flocs and aggregates to remove heavy metals 89 91 hecc as flocculant showed an excellent performance for cu ii coagulation flocculation the initial metal ion concentration effect on the flocculation capacity at ph value of 6 was studied and illustrated on fig 8 a as shown on fig 8a at low concentrations of the metal ion solution above 200 ppm the density of the free chelating functions is very important in front of the fraction which complexes the copper metal ions at this level metal ions are unable to reach the energy barrier of hecc to neutralize its negative charge and this overcomes the electrostatic repulsion forces that guarantee the stability of the solution on increasing the concentration of the metal ions the cu ii ions were trapped in intermolecular cavities and form interchain bridges at the supramolecular level and consequently generate three dimensional networks flocs which precipitate easily under gravitational action fig 8b shows the influence of ph in a range of ph 2 to 8 on the coagulation flocculation of cu ii solution with hecc where the initial concentration ion solution of cu ii was determined from the above optimization results to be 800 ppm fig 8a at low ph 4 a low flocculation capacity was noticed and this is due to the proton competition where the protonation of the carboxylic groups grafted on hec is much envisaged moreover the hecc chain was affected by the ph change and it was observed the formation of blue aggregates at the ph pka ph 5 and ph 6 which is attributed to the high degree of ionization of carboxyl groups so increases bridging supramolecular binding with metallic ions by increasing the ph beyond ph6 a redistribution of the ionic forms of cu ii is certainly envisaged thus generating new ionic species with new electrical properties indeed in acidic conditions coagulation flocculation is attributed to the formation of supramolecular bridges resulting from complexation phenomena between metal ions and polymer chains whereas under alkaline conditions between ph 7 and ph 8 the conversion of cu ii ions to cu oh and cu oh 2 causes the formation of a new colloidal system increasing its zeta potential meaning a significant increase in the flocculating activity of hecc zeta potential 45 mv in addition the formation of the new copper chemical forms in the system as a function of ph was confirmed by the very remarkable changes of the floc coloring from the blue color characteristic of aqueous cu ii to the black characteristic of cu oh and cu oh 2to ph8 fig 8b the formation of cu oh and cu oh 2in the system at the ph 8 indicates that ph has a significant and high influence on the coagulation flocculation process where the charge neutralization mechanism is much more suggestive for a ph higher than 8 instead of complexation bridging in the ph zone below 6 in the other hand hecc has shown excellent capacity 400 mg g 1 for copper removal as a heavy metal from the aquatic systems in addition flocculation coagulation is instantaneously achieved which is desirable for the treatment of industrial water systems while almost all of the heavy metal removal treatments using cellulose derivatives are based on the adsorption technique which requires a long equilibrium time and low adsorption capacity compared to hecc 92 97 the use of hecc as flocculant can give a new alternative from an economic and ecological point of view nevertheless to replace the processes based on aluminum which is the responsible factor for different kind of clinical and neuro pathological disease alzheimer s parkinson guam s parkinson s diabetes cancer and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 98 101 4 conclusion new water soluble cellulosic derivative hecc based on the incorporation of the carboxylate groups on the hec structure was successfully synthesized using reverse microemulsion water cyclohexane method the polyacrylamide chain extension was stopped using water as a hydrogen transfer agent where cyclohexane was used as a continuous phase to limit the hydrophobicity of polymer resulting from the grafting reaction then can decrease the advancement of the reaction in addition the saponification of the amide group leading to carboxylate increased significantly the negative charge density of the polymer chain which is confirmed by the high negative value of zeta potential 45 mv of hecc the structural changes during the reactions were studied using the spectroscopy techniques ftir 1h 13c nmr and deept 135 x ray diffraction patterns have shown that the grafting process is accompanied by the appearance of a new crystalline order due to the high density of the hydrogen bonds the morphological changes and the composition of the surfaces were studied

introduction with the enormous global market demand for cellulosic fibers estimated at usd 37 billion in 2020 1 cellulose chemistry has become a global priority of the modern economy in comparison with the economic market of synthetic diamond which will not exceed usd 29 billion in 2023 2 cellulose and its derivatives have become the suitable to be the primary chemical resource of modern industry where it currently dominates the second priority of the european bioeconomy 3 indicating that the exploitation of cellulose and its derivatives is a global issue in economic and environmental terms cellulose is the most abundant biodegradable renewable and biocompatible natural polymer 4 since its typical and unique chemical structure resulting from the high density of hydrogen bonds 5 6 confers it a high structural stability limiting its direct application in many industrial areas moreover its insolubility in common solvents except that in complex expensive and toxic solvent systems 7 12 is the major obstacle to homogenous modification process 13 in addition the thermal modification is remote because of its degradation before reaching the melting state then some considerable efforts over the last decades have pushed towards new classes of solvents such as ionic solvents 14 20 des 21 27 and ndes 28 31 which showed great efficiency in solvating the cellulose but still remain expensive toxic in some conditions 32 33 indeed it was found that an increase in length of the alkyl chain in 1 alkyl 3 methylimidazolium salts increases the toxicity and can even lead to substances more toxic than methanol 34 36 and the second drawback that observed is the biodegradability decrease 37 various anionic cationic and nonionic cellulose based flocculants have been synthesized in order to replace those based on synthetic current polymer for water treatment 34 36 38 44 medical and pharmaceutical industries 45 49 yongbo song et al studied the flocculating properties of cellulose grafted am monomer amc in the urea naoh aqueous medium the results reported that the flocculating capacity of the colloidal fe oh 3 particles increases over time reaction promoting the saponification of amide groups into carboxylate form 50 in addition polyacrylamide grafted polyvinyl pyrollidone pvp g pam showed a good flocculation efficacy in coal fine suspension and in destabilization of aqueous suspension of nanoparticles multi walled carbon nano tubes without and in presence of other ions 51 in the same way gum tragacanth grafted poly of diallyldimethylammonium chloride gt g p dadmac enhanced the water solubility and functionality of gt which showed a high efficacy as a flocculant in model aqueous suspensions of kaolin and multi walled carbon nano tubes mwcnt through standard jar test procedure 52 the copolymers of polyacrylamide and carboxymethyl cellulose in aqueous alcohol medium using a ceric ion initiator and batch polymerization was successfully prepared by okieimen and tested their efficacy as flocculant against kaolin suspension 53 hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate hpmcp has been used as a flocculant for the recovery of silver from industrial wastewater 54 the xanthates derivatives of cellulose showed also a good flocculation efficiency for calcite and chrysocolla 55 the cellulosic ether derivatives such as hydroxypropyl cellulose hpc and hydroxyethyl cellulose hec have been widely used as intermediate water soluble cellulosic polymer to prepare new classes of functional materials indeed ce iv induced free radical polymerization was used by ahmed a et al to prepare ph sensitive interpenetrating network ipn microspheres mps by emulsion crosslinking method using glutaraldehyde ga as a crosslinking agent 56 the swelling behavior in water of hpc graft copolymerized with acrylamide aam using benzoyl peroxide as the initiator and crosslinked with glutaraldehyde was also studied 57 while the removal of heavy metals from aquatic environments by flocculation using modified cellulosic ethers is poorly discussed in literature in this paper a new water soluble cellulosic derivative hecc was successfully elaborated and investigated as an effective anionic coagulant flocculant for colloidal systems fe oh 3 and to remove heavy metal ions cu ii from aquatic environments hecc was successfully synthesized via an unconventional reverse microemulsion process using water as ecofriendly solvent and as hydrogen transfer agent where cyclohexane was employed as continuous phase to reduce the hydrophobicity of the medium the grafting reaction of am was followed by an alkali saponification reaction removing an amount of ammonia trapped by boric acid solution and quantified by volumetric dosage using tashiro indicator the saponification reaction showed an important increase in the negative charge density where the zeta potential value of hecc reached 45 mv the proposed structure effect of grafting process on the crystalline order morphological changes and the elementary composition were studied using ftir 1h 13c nmr deept 135 xrd and sem edx respectively the new hecc flocculant showed a high flocculation capacity to fe oh 3 colloidal system at 35 μl as added volume of 1 flocculant solution furthermore the ph variation was investigated to show its effect on the coagulation flocculation mechanism and on the flocculating capacity to remove cu ii from aqueous solution to our knowledge based on a literature review hecc has never been discussed before on the synthesis side and synthesis method either for application as coagulant flocculant colloidal systems or for the removal of heavy metals hecc was successfully developed as a novel water treatment agent with high coagulation flocculation efficiency non toxicity low cost eco friendly and promising candidates for industrial applications 2 experimental and methods 2 1 materials hec ds 1 5 of 95 purity was obtained from himedia company and dissolution precipitation method in water acetone solvents was used for its purification am c3h5no cyclohexane c6h12 copper nitrate cu no3 2 and iron chloride fecl3 were purchased from sigma aldrich all other chemicals and solvents were obtained from fluka company and were used without further purification 2 2 methods 2 2 1 instrumental analysis the chemical structures of hec hecac and hecc samples were characterized using fourier transform infrared ftir technique the spectra were recorded on shimadzu ftir 8400s spectrometer using a finely ground kbr pellets with 2 of the sample at a resolution of 2 cm 1 an average of 40 scans were taken for each sample and recorded from 4000 to 400 cm 1 1h and 13c nmr measurements were carried on a brukeravance 400 mhz spectrometer at 360 k using tms as internal standard dmso d 6 and d2o were used as solvent for hec and hecc respectively approximately 10 mg of hec was dissolved in 1 ml dmso d 6 and 2 drops of tfa were added to displace the h2o peaks in the case of 13c nmr for the both samples hec and hecc approximately 50 mg of sample was dissolved in 1 ml of dmso d 6 or d2o without tfa for each sample approximately 14 000 scans and a d1 of 2 s were required the sample crystallinity was evaluated using x ray diffraction technique and was performed on an x ray diffractometer equinox 2000 using copper radiation cuk α λ 1 5418 a at an accelerating voltage of 40 kv and an operating current of 30 ma all patterns were recorded in the range of 2θ 5 35 0 25 g of each sample is pressed under 50 mpa to form pellets of 25 mm in average diameter thermal behaviors of hec hecar and hecc samples were performed using thermogravimetric analysis tga on a shimadzu dtg 60 simultaneous dta tg apparatus the sample weight was between 8 and 12 mg two scans were run from room temperature to 500 c at a rate of10 c min 1under nitrogen purge 50 ml min 1 the evolution of the surface morphologies and the microstructures of samples were investigated before and after modification using scanning electron microscopy tescan vega iii lm with an accelerating voltage of 10 kv moreover energy dispersive x ray analyzer edax was employed for profiling the different elements present on the polymer surfaces the zeta potential ζ conductivity and electrophoretic mobility as a function of ph ph 2 11 of hec and hecc in milli q water at 0 1 of each sample were measured using zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments at 25 0 1 c 2 2 2 coagulation flocculation of colloidal ferric hydroxide solution fe oh 3 ferric hydroxide colloidal system fe oh 3 is prepared by the hydrolysis of saturated solution of ferric chloride fe cl 3 with boiling distilled water the fe cl 3 solution was added drop wise to the boiling water until the obtaining of a brilliant dark red colloidal solution appeared the coagulation flocculation study was carried out by adding 10 200 μl of an aqueous solution of hecc 1 to 5 mlof saturated fe oh 3 colloidal solution then the transmittance of the surnageant for each added volume of flocculant solution is measured using uv 1800 uv vis shimadzu spectrophotometer resolution of 1 nm between 500 and 600 nm 2 2 3 cu ii removal capacity the coagulation flocculation capacity cfc of hec and hecc samples for the removal of cu ii metal ion was studied using 2 ml of flocculant aqueous solution at 0 5 and 10 ml of aqueous metal ion the metal ion concentration ranges from 100 to 800 mg l 1 and the ph value varied from 2 to 8 the ph of the different solutions was adjusted by adding different concentrations of hcl or naoh indeed the metal ion concentrations of the supernatant were determined by atomic absorption measurements using flame atomic absorption faa thermoscienific ice3000 type ice3500aa system and the fcc qe mg g 1 was evaluated by the following equation eq 1 1 q e c 0 c e v m where c0 is the initial concentration of metal ion mg l 1 ce is the metal ion equilibrium concentration of metal ion mg l 1 m is the mass of hecc g and v is the volume of the solution l 2 2 4 preparation of hecc hecc sample was obtained by anionic grafting of am on hydroxyethylcellulose hec by reverse microemulsion water cyclohexane followed by alkali saponification of amide groups to carboxylate form since 1 g 13 87 mmol of am was added to 1 g 4 38 mmol 13 16 mmol oh of alkoxylated hec in 7 ml of naoh 1 n solution the mixture was kept under stirring at room temperature until a transparent solution appeared then 15 ml 2 3 of cyclohexane c6h12 were added to the mixture under stirring and heated at 60 c for 2 h then the mixture was neutralized using ethanolic hcl solution and the hecac was precipitated in a large excess of cold ethanol filtered under vacuum and washed with cold ethanol frequently then it was stocked in a desiccator in the presence of p2o5 for one week the saponification 1 g of hecac to hecc was carried out in naoh 4 n solution for 12 h fig 1 3 results and discussions the new cellulosic derivative hecc as a new low cost biodegradable and ecofriendly coagulant flocculant of positive charged particles such as colloidal systems fe oh 3 and heavy metal ions cu ii was successfully prepared by anionic grafting of am on hec using reverse microemulsion water cyclohexane in the first step hec alkoxylation was carried out in naoh 1 n solution creating anionic sites alkoxide at the polymer surface 58 which initiate the grafting reaction by nucleophilic attack of the double bond of am fig 1 generally the reaction of a nucleophilic center with monomers having π system in their molecular structures allows to their anionic polymerization for this reason the water was used on one hand as ecofriendly solvent and on the other hand as a hydrogen transfer agent to avoid the formation of polyacrylamide on the hec main chain which can limit its aqueous solubility however the grafting of hec with acrylamide increases at a certain level the hydrophobicity to the resulting derivative consequently its solubility in the aqueous medium was reduced then the reactivity of hec and consequently low degree of substitution values is expected at this stage cyclohexane was introduced to reduce the hydrophobicity and to increase the solubility and consequently the reactivity of hec 3 1 structural analysis 3 1 1 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir fig 2 a and b shows the ftir spectra of am hec hecac and hecc respectively the absorption characteristic band of the oh elongations is located around 3400 cm 1 and those detected at 2920 2881 cm 1 are attributed to the symmetric and asymmetric ch vibrations the deformation vibration characterizing the natural absorbed water in hec structure fig 2a is localized at 1640 cm 1 4 13 58 the grafting of acrylamide on hec was justified by the appearance of a new absorption band at1672 cm 1 characterizing carbonyl amide co amide on the hecac spectrum fig 2a also the appearance of a new absorption bands overlapped by oh bands at 3223 cm 1 attributed to the vibrations of the amide nh2 indicates the success of the grafting reaction 59 in addition the effect of the reaction medium alkalinity on the saponification of amide groups to carboxylate form was confirmed by the appearance of a new absorption band at 1566 cm 1 attributed to the carbonyl of the carboxylate moreover the comparison of the peak intensities at 1672 cm 1 and at 1566 cm 1 shows that the amide groups attached to hec backbone are predominant in the cellulosic polymer the absence of the absorption band characteristic of the π binding cc at 1614 cm 1 indicates that hecac obtained is free of any residual product 60 61 in relation with the applications envisaged the negative charge on the hecc surface is ensured by the saponification reaction allowing the conversion of the amide groups to the carboxylate form this total conversion is justified by the total disappearance of the absorption bands of the group and by a notable increase of the characteristic absorption band of carboxylate carbonyl vibrations at 1568 cm 1 fig 2b furthermore trapping of the ammonia released by boric acid solution allows following the saponification reaction in the presence of the tashiro indicator and was titrated with hcl solution this typical dosage gives the different values of ds reported in table 1 1h and 13c and dept 135 nmr measurements were carried out using dmso d 6 and d2o as solvent for hec and hecc respectively in the case of hec tfa was added to dmso d 6 to displace the h2o proton signals the d2owas used as solvent to avoid the overlap of am methylene signals in hecc with those of dmso fig 3 a and b shows 1h 13c and dept 135 nmr spectra of hec in dmso d 6 tfa a and hecc in d2o b in fig 3a the signals of the methylene protons on α of different hydroxyl groups are located at 3 6 ppm and those attached to the carbon c6 of the cellulose backbone gives some signals at around 3 5 ppm the broad ring proton signals of the cellulose skeleton are recorded from 2 8 to 5 6 ppm moreover the typical carbon signals of hec methylene fig 3a were detected from 60 7 to 72 7 ppm and the peaks assigned to the carbons of cellulose main chains are located in the game of 60 105 ppm 4 13 58 the 1h nmr spectrum of the hecc sample fig 3b shows the recording of new signals at 2 43 ppm and 3 69 ppm which are attributed to the methylene proton resonances of the grafted acrylate moieties 1 and 3 respectively furthermore the chemical shifts distribution of the carbons in the hecc sample fig 3b gives the evidence of the grafting reaction by the detection of new peaks attributed to the sp3 carbons of the grafted acrylate entities 1 and 3 at 37 77 ppm and 67 71 ppm the significant peak located at 180 04 ppm 7 was assigned to the quaternary carbon of carboxylate form 62 38 63 and the absence of a further signal in this area characterizing quaternary carbon is a strong indication of the total saponification process amide carboxylate however the persistence of the peak at 60 54 ppm on the 13c nmr spectrum of hecc indicates that there is still a partial amount of unmodified primary alcohols hydroxyl group where a ds value less than 1 5 can be expected 4 13 58 dept 135 spectrum of hecc fig 3b confirms the investigation of the structural changes in the hec structure indeed the resonance signals of the cellulosic carbons c1 c2 c3 c4 and c5 change the orientation by 180 whereas the signal at 180 04 ppm 7 disappeared indicating its quaternary character where the methylene protons signals ch2 kept their orientation the ds value was calculated using the integration of specific proton signals and it was estimated at 1 in addition the absence of the proton and the carbon signals of polyacrylamide is a good indication of hydrogen transfer and that the polymerization of am was avoided these results show that the grafting reaction was successfully performed and the hecc sample is free of any residual product 3 2 scanning electron microscopy fig 4 shows sem images and edax spectra of hec hecac and hecc unmodified hec displayed a morphology consisting of agglomerated particles the aggregates thus observed were discontinuously cemented between each other these morphological entities resulted from the high density of hydrogen bonds that forms the predominant type of intra and interchain interactions in hec structure the introduction of the amide groups in the hec backbone hecac causes a significant variation in the crystal order of the polymer structure therefore continuous morphology where the agglomerations disappear and this result is confirmed by xrd after saponification of hecac the hecc microstructure has agglomerated again and this can be attributed to the decreasing in the density of the hydrogen bonds moreover the increase of o c atomic ratio and the appearance of na peak on the edx spectrum of hecc is strong indication of that the grafting reaction was successfully occurred then the polymer surface becomes more anionic and enhances its solubility in aqueous medium and its ability to interact with positive charged particles such as heavy metals and colloidal systems 3 3 x ray diffraction and thermal analysis fig 5 a shows the xrd diffractograms of acrylamide hec and hecac the xrd diffractograms of microcrystalline cellulose and hecac are presented in fig 5b fig 5a demonstrates that the amorphous aspect of hec disappeared after the introduction of acrylamide entities into its structure and a new crystalline order appeared on hecac xrd diffractogram this phenomenon results from substitution of oh by a new group leading to a change in the arrangement and the density of hydrogen bonds in hec indeed fig 5b shows that the new lattice planes characterized by bragg angles 2θ 14 20 17 02 18 70 and 25 84 is similar to that of microcrystalline cellulose with a clear shift to small 2θ angle where the intercalation of the macromolecular chains as effect of grafting reaction will be suggested at supramolecular level the success of the experimental approach is also proven by a notable destruction of the crystalline order of am 64 the thermal behavior of hec hecac and hecc are shown in fig 5c the thermograms show two phases of mass loss the first is located at around 100 c that is attributed to the loss of solvents and to the absorbed moisture while the second seat of loss of mass is observed between 240 and 250 c and which corresponds to the temperature of the thermal degradation of the three cellulosic polymers this result shows that the modification whether by amide groups or by carboxylates does not influence the thermal stability of hecac and hecc in comparison with hec 65 3 4 zeta potential electrophoretic mobility and conductivity zeta potential measurements are used to evaluate the surface charge density of polymers the dependence of the zeta potential on ph was investigated and fig 6 shows the effect of the incorporation of carboxylate entities in the hec surface taking into account the ph values so no important effect of the ph on zeta potential was noted the electrophoretic mobility and conductivity were measured for hec and the values of those parameters remain zero throughout the ph range studied which is acceptable and in accordance with the uncharged structure of hec the potentiometric behavior of hecc awakens three stages of variation of zeta potential according to the ph values the first stage was recorded in the range of ph from 2 to 5 showing a progressive increase in the value of zeta potential from 0 to 20 mv indicating the deprotonation of carboxylic function leading to the carboxylate form the second one describes a sharp decrease of zeta potential from ph 5 to ph 7 to reaching a limit value around 45 mv and indicating a complete deprotonation of the carboxylic functions above neutral ph the value of zeta potential remains constant justifying the stability of the charge density at the level of the polymer surface the electrophoretic mobility is proportional to the surface charge density and zeta potential so it can be useful to confirm the variation obtained in the zeta potential value it s worth noticing the similarity between the variation of zeta potential and electrophoretic mobility is clearly noted fig 6 the study of electrical behavior using conductivity as a function of ph confirmed the results obtained from zeta potential and electrophoretic mobility where a decrease in the conductivity of the aqueous hecc solution between ph 2 and ph 5 is a strong indication that the saponification reaction of the acid function was occurred in addition the point of intersection of the two lines of the variation of the conductivity is found between ph 5 and ph 7 indicating the neutralization of the acidic form at the hecc surface from ph7 the change of the conductivity curve orientation as a function of ph towards a positive slope proves the total consumption of the carboxylic functions and the alkalinity of the medium increases its conductivity 3 5 application 3 5 1 coagulation flocculation of colloidal systems fe oh3 the insoluble colloidal particles of ferric hydroxide were prepared by hydrolysis reaction of fecl3 where the positive charge characterizing their colloidal surface is due to the ionization of the hydroxyl groups of the fe oh 3colloidal particles and the hydrochloric acid produced during the hydrolysis was removed by heating to avoid destabilization and coagulation of colloidal system the presence of the opposite charge given by hecc destabilizes the colloidal system to avoid the repulsion of colloidal particles and therefore coagulation flocculation and clarification of the solution were observed the coagulation flocculation of colloidal fe oh 3 solution by hecc was studied according to the added volume of flocculant solution and the results were illustrated on fig 7 where the ph of the system was fixed betweenph6 and ph7 as the optimal value corresponding to the total deprotonation of carboxylic entities grafted on hec backbone on the other hand the phpzc point of zero charge of fe oh 3 is largely discussed in literature and is determined at 8 5 value 66 so optimizing the ph value between 6 and 7 assured the electrostatic interactions between colloidal particles of fe oh 3 positively charged and the polymer surface of hecc with a negative charge fig 7 shows that the maximum transmittance value 99 was achieved at 35 μl of flocculant solution and then the transmittance of the transparency zone increased progressively by adding more of the flocculant solution in comparison with other flocculants approaching hecc at the structural level yongbo song et al have studied the flocculation capacity of am grafted cellulose ds 0 67 synthesized in the naoh urea h2o system of ferric hydroxide fe oh 3 saturated colloidal solution and the results in the same conditions of this study showed that flocculation was achieved at an optimal dose of 428 mg l 1 which corresponds to flocculant solution 1 w volume of 300 μl 50 however the new flocculant hecc improved the flocculating capacity 10 times with a volume of the flocculating solution of 35 μl also m i khalil and a a aly have shown that the ability of a ferric laurate solution to flocculate transmittance by anionic starch derivatives such as carboxymethyl starch carboxyethyl starch poly acrylic acid starch graft copolymer and starch 2 hydroxypropyl citrate is between 43 and 82 even at optimum dose of flocculant which reaches 125 mg l 1 67 to better understand the coagulation flocculation mechanism of colloidal particles of fe oh 3 system it is necessary to know that the electric charge architecture double electric layer of the colloidal particles is divided into layers of stern and gouy chapman the stern layer electrically associates with a diffuse layer of free ions with an opposite charge gouy chapman layer however the two layers give the particles a characteristic potential called the zeta potential and to destabilize the colloidal system towards coagulation flocculation it is necessary to provide the particles with sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the repulsive energy barrier the destabilization of the colloidal particles can be achieved by the double layer compression mechanism where the thickness of the double layer decreases in relation to the ionic concentration of the system e g metal salt coagulant which causes the decrease of the repulsive effect of diffuse layer until the elimination of the energy barrier 68 72 in addition charge neutralization and bridging mechanisms are widely envisaged in flocculation coagulation process using polymeric systems as alternative coagulants flocculants to overcome the problems associated with the use of inorganic coagulants aluminum and iron based alum 73 80 the latter bridging mechanism is available for very high molecular weight anionic flocculants 3 30 106 g mol 1 with a low charge density which adsorb on more than one particle and the flocculant acts as a bridge and binds several particles to form aggregates 55 however the charge neutralization mechanism is based on zeta potential neutralization where the coagulant flocculant is adsorbed to the colloidal surface causing their electric discharge and reduction of their electrophoretic mobility 81 82 at this stage the neutralized particles can be charged by the positively charged adjacent particles and hence the formation of flocs where both mechanisms can act simultaneously with the excess of polymer there are not enough particle surfaces available for fixation and the particles become destabilized which can cause some electrostatic repulsion ensured by the regular distribution of the carboxylate group along the polymeric chain of flocculent this phenomenon has been observed when the added volume of the flocculant solution exceeds 35 μl as an optimal volume the degree of polymerization dp 220 of hec determined by viscometer allows to estimate the approximate size of the flocculant polymer chain at 71 000 g mol 1 however this low molecular weight value in comparison with the colloidal size indicates the predominance of the charge neutralization mechanism 3 5 2 coagulation flocculation of heavy metal ions cu ii the incorporation of new carboxylate groups in cellulosic structure was extensively studied to improve its physicochemical properties including surface charge and to elaborate a large variety of new heavy metals adsorbents however these modifications remain at the level of the cellulosic surface or by crosslinking limiting the elimination of micro pollutants to electrostatic adsorption on the surface of the adsorbent without reaching the chelating groups in the cellulose polymer core in this paper the homogeneous insertion of the carboxylate groups in the hec main chain giving a new water soluble polymer hecc characterized by a high negative charge density useful in removing metal ions from aquatic environments basing on the flocculation coagulation phenomenon however the flocculation mechanism for removal of heavy metal in ionic form from aquatic environments is widely discussed in the literature using polysaccharide based polymers such as flocculants indeed bingzhi liu et al have studied the role of ionic groups of carboxylate rich magnetic chitosan flocculants on the efficiency and kinetics of removal of heavy metal and cationic dye where the optimal uptake rate was 98 3 and 87 4 and exhibited satisfactory removal effect in wide range ph range 4 0 8 0 for ni ii 5 0 10 0 for mg and mechanism of flocculation has been explained by a rapid initial adsorption performed by the action of the carboxylic groups which forms complexes with the metal ion in which the oxygen donates electrons to metal ions thus the electron density at the adjacent two carbon atoms decreases 83 84 in addition liang wu et al have synthesized an amphoteric starch derivative that was applied as a water soluble polysaccharide ether and effective flocculant for heavy metal ion cu ii and zn ii removal from wastewater in which remove rate for cu ii and zn ii remained at 93 and 91 after three flocculation regeneration cycles and the mechanism of flocculation was explained by the extent of negatively charged flocculant and heavy metal cations 85 in the same sense l liu et al have proposed the same mechanism explained by chemisorption chelation of metal ions and charge neutralization which facilitated bridge adsorption by p am dmdaac polymer chains to form large floccules 86 also yongjun sun et al have studied the application of the new chitosan based flocculants as good ph resistance and high heavy metals removal capacity where the mechanism of flocculation was attributed firstly to the phenomenon of chelation flocculation where the metal ions are chelated by the carboxylic groups negatively charged this alters the electrostatic polymer behavior that leads to the charge and bridging mechanism 87 whereas the effect of the flocculant dose plays an early role in the flocculation mechanism where the optimal dose causes adsorption mechanisms bridging and seep flocculation 88 generally the flocculation of heavy metals by water soluble polymeric flocculants is attributed according to numerous recent studies to the chelation and trapping of the metal ion by chelating groups which are present on the polymer chain followed by a neutralization of charge and adsorption bridging and seep flocculation to form the flocs and aggregates to remove heavy metals 89 91 hecc as flocculant showed an excellent performance for cu ii coagulation flocculation the initial metal ion concentration effect on the flocculation capacity at ph value of 6 was studied and illustrated on fig 8 a as shown on fig 8a at low concentrations of the metal ion solution above 200 ppm the density of the free chelating functions is very important in front of the fraction which complexes the copper metal ions at this level metal ions are unable to reach the energy barrier of hecc to neutralize its negative charge and this overcomes the electrostatic repulsion forces that guarantee the stability of the solution on increasing the concentration of the metal ions the cu ii ions were trapped in intermolecular cavities and form interchain bridges at the supramolecular level and consequently generate three dimensional networks flocs which precipitate easily under gravitational action fig 8b shows the influence of ph in a range of ph 2 to 8 on the coagulation flocculation of cu ii solution with hecc where the initial concentration ion solution of cu ii was determined from the above optimization results to be 800 ppm fig 8a at low ph 4 a low flocculation capacity was noticed and this is due to the proton competition where the protonation of the carboxylic groups grafted on hec is much envisaged moreover the hecc chain was affected by the ph change and it was observed the formation of blue aggregates at the ph pka ph 5 and ph 6 which is attributed to the high degree of ionization of carboxyl groups so increases bridging supramolecular binding with metallic ions by increasing the ph beyond ph6 a redistribution of the ionic forms of cu ii is certainly envisaged thus generating new ionic species with new electrical properties indeed in acidic conditions coagulation flocculation is attributed to the formation of supramolecular bridges resulting from complexation phenomena between metal ions and polymer chains whereas under alkaline conditions between ph 7 and ph 8 the conversion of cu ii ions to cu oh and cu oh 2 causes the formation of a new colloidal system increasing its zeta potential meaning a significant increase in the flocculating activity of hecc zeta potential 45 mv in addition the formation of the new copper chemical forms in the system as a function of ph was confirmed by the very remarkable changes of the floc coloring from the blue color characteristic of aqueous cu ii to the black characteristic of cu oh and cu oh 2to ph8 fig 8b the formation of cu oh and cu oh 2in the system at the ph 8 indicates that ph has a significant and high influence on the coagulation flocculation process where the charge neutralization mechanism is much more suggestive for a ph higher than 8 instead of complexation bridging in the ph zone below 6 in the other hand hecc has shown excellent capacity 400 mg g 1 for copper removal as a heavy metal from the aquatic systems in addition flocculation coagulation is instantaneously achieved which is desirable for the treatment of industrial water systems while almost all of the heavy metal removal treatments using cellulose derivatives are based on the adsorption technique which requires a long equilibrium time and low adsorption capacity compared to hecc 92 97 the use of hecc as flocculant can give a new alternative from an economic and ecological point of view nevertheless to replace the processes based on aluminum which is the responsible factor for different kind of clinical and neuro pathological disease alzheimer s parkinson guam s parkinson s diabetes cancer and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 98 101 4 conclusion new water soluble cellulosic derivative hecc based on the incorporation of the carboxylate groups on the hec structure was successfully synthesized using reverse microemulsion water cyclohexane method the polyacrylamide chain extension was stopped using water as a hydrogen transfer agent where cyclohexane was used as a continuous phase to limit the hydrophobicity of polymer resulting from the grafting reaction then can decrease the advancement of the reaction in addition the saponification of the amide group leading to carboxylate increased significantly the negative charge density of the polymer chain which is confirmed by the high negative value of zeta potential 45 mv of hecc the structural changes during the reactions were studied using the spectroscopy techniques ftir 1h 13c nmr and deept 135 x ray diffraction patterns have shown that the grafting process is accompanied by the appearance of a new crystalline order due to the high density of the hydrogen bonds the morphological changes and the composition of the surfaces were studied using sem images and edx spectra the new hecc flocculant showed a high coagulation flocculation capacity toward fe oh 3 colloidal system and cu ii ions removal from aqueous solutions the ph effect has been studied indicating an important influence on the coagulation flocculation mechanism and on the flocculating capacity acknowledgements this work was supported by cnrst under grant no ppr 2015 17
