15330,with the development of comprehensive utilization of high salinity wastewater salt resources regeneration has been considered as the fundamental requirement for process sustainability and economic benefits as one of the potential candidates bipolar membrane electrodialysis bmed was rapidly developed in recent years for the treatment of saline wastewater different from other methods directly obtaining salts or condensed wastewater bmed could utilize and convert the dissolved waste salt into higher value acid and alkali simultaneously which has various advantages including outstanding environmental effects and economic benefits in this review the recent applications of bmed for waste salt recovery and high value acid alkali generation from saline wastewater were systematically outlined based on the summary above the economy analysis of bmed was further reviewed from the roles of desalination and resources recovery in addition the bmed based processes integrated with in situ utilization of the generated acid alkali resources were discussed furthermore the influence of operating factors on bmed performance were outlined finally the strategies for improving bmed performance were concluded furthermore the future application and prospects of bmed was presented this work would provide guidance for the applications of bipolar membrane

and industry the continuously increasing production of high salinity wastewater presents a significant challenge to both the environment maintenance and resources utilization chen et al 2022a the discharge of saline wastewater would significantly degrade water quality in the environment and thus water cannot be directly used for potable water and industrial applications panagopoulos 2022a 2022b to handle this situation effective treatment of high salinity wastewater was proposed to reduce the negative impacts of salts on the environment and offer a potential route for resources recycling chen et al 2022a lv et al 2022 shao et al 2019 during the treatment of saline wastewater the concept of minimal liquid discharge mld and zero liquid discharge zld have brought a revolution in recent years chen et al 2021a panagopoulos and giannika 2022 qiu et al 2021 tong and elimelech 2016 to meet the objectives of mld zld and achieve efficient salt recycling a range of technologies have been developed such as electrodialysis ed forward osmosis fo and membrane distillation md panagopoulos 2021 panagopoulos and haralambous 2020 among the various technologies ed technology has been widely used in the enrichment and recovery of liquid mineral resources from brine wastewater benefitting from its sustainable and efficient processing characteristics gmar and chagnes 2019 pei et al 2019 ye et al 2018 however ed only achieves solution separation into dilute and concentrated streams after which the concentrated salt solutions are usually crystallized into solid states nevertheless the solid salts are generally cheap compared with the process cost which encourages further research to utilize and upgrade the salt resources into more valuable products based on the traditional electrodialysis process bipolar membrane bpm was introduced to integrate water dissociation at the interface layer and thus bmed was fabricated bunani et al 2017 culcasi et al 2022 huang et al 2006 koter 2007 tian et al 2019 when current is applied to the bpm the ionic current through the membrane cannot be maintained in the bulk solution because neither cations nor anions could pass through the two membranes of the bpm pärnamäe et al 2021 as a result the dissociated h and oh would migrate across the cation exchange membrane cem and anion exchange membrane aem to maintain ionic current at the membrane interface respectively as a result by using bpm produced h and oh in a properly designed bmed membrane configuration salts could be successfully converted into acids and alkalis bmed technology has many advantages including no gas or byproduct generation higher energy utilization space saving and easier installation over traditional chemical technologies sun et al 2017 considering its environmental effects and cost effective benefits hung et al 2022 ye et al 2015 bmed has been emerged as an efficient and green technique in food process ali et al 2011 faucher et al 2020 rozoy et al 2015 co2 capture eisaman et al 2012 iizuka et al 2012 muroyama et al 2020 nagasawa et al 2009 patterson bruce et al 2019 comprehensive utilization of waste residue dai et al 2021 liang et al 2021 xue et al 2015 and high salinity wastewater treatment lin et al 2019 shen et al 2013b wei et al 2013 ye et al 2015 especially for the saline wastewater the contained low grade salts could be converted into concentrated acid and alkali solutions with higher values furthermore in the general industry acids and alkalis are usually used to a variety of acid base neutralization reactions therefore numerous attentions have also been focused on developing in situ reaction system by integrating bmed chambers and neutralization reactions to produce higher valuable chemical products in a unit operation currently significant breakthroughs on the preparation of acids alkalis via bmed have been achieved and some reviews on bmed have also been published for instance fernandez et al summarized the applications of bmed technology for the treatment of concentrated brine streams from reverse osmosis ro desalination and nacl rich industrial wastewater fernandez gonzalez et al 2016 moreover pärnamäe reviewed the mainly principles developments and applications about bpm pärnamäe et al 2021 different from the process oriented reviews above the electrochemical systems with bpm were reviewed by blommaert et al from the aspect of energy conversion blommaert et al 2021 nevertheless these contributions didn t outline the applications of bmed in saline wastewater especially from the role of resources utilization moreover there is no systematic contribution on the applications of bmed for high salinity wastewater treatment and its resources utilization therefore it is essential to review the reported work to provide theoretical and practical guidance for the future research in this review the applications of bmed for high salinity wastewater treatment and its resources utilization into valuable acids and alkalis were summarized based on the summary of acid alkali production by bmed the further in situ utilization of acid and alkali to fabricate integrated bmed processes was discussed furthermore the mechanism and the influence of operation factors during bmed including current density initial solution concentration configuration of membrane stack temperature initial volume ratios and type of electrode solution were outlined finally the prospects and research interests for bmed were also proposed 2 methodology 2 1 search strategy in this section the methodology and process of selecting relevant literature on the reviewed subject were elaborated according to boolean and position operators a literature search was carried out in a systematic manner to exhaustively identify all available literature on bmed based processes in this work fig 1 the literature research in this review mainly derived from two main databases scopus and web of science since these two databases covered a broad range of publications with large variability mongeon and paul hus 2016 as shown in fig 1 the keywords involved in this section could be divided into two parts in the scopus database the first part was consisted of bipolar membrane electrodialysis or bmed or edbm or bipolar w 15 electrodialysis while another part was formed by the words acid base and alkali similarly the keywords in web of science database were made up of bipolar membrane electrodialysis or bmed or edbm or bipolar near 15 electrodialysis and acid base alkali afterwards the number of articles searched via scopus and web of science were 358 and 382 respectively 2 2 screening and selection of article after searching the corresponding articles the two stage screening and selection of articles was conducted the preliminary selection was achieved by eliminating the identical literature retrieved from these two databases furthermore considering the orientation of resources utilization the broad inclusion criteria were mainly concentrated on the applications of bmed in acids and alkalis production consequently 167 papers focusing on acids and alkalis extraction were selected from the first stage of screening as shown in fig 1 the second stage of selecting articles was also based on the purpose of this review i e the high value resources recovery from salt containing solutions by bmed especially the mechanism technology operation and the economic analysis of bmed process should be covered therefore the detailed inclusion criteria were mainly focused on the following four points 1 including the mechanism of bmed 2 including the resources recovery from saline wastewater 3 discussing the influencing factors e g current density initial solution concentration configuration of membrane stack 4 cost evaluation of bmed processes finally 109 papers were selected to perform the literature review after two stage screening and selection 3 bmed for acid alkali production 3 1 mechanism of acid alkali production by bipolar membrane the most special feature of bmed is the introduction of bipolar membrane to the traditional electrodialysis bipolar membrane is composed of aem and cem with a catalytic medium in the intermediate layer at present there are only two solvents reported to be dissociated in bipolar membranes fig 2 water h2o into h and oh and methanol ch3oh into h and ch3o as shown in eqs 1 2 huang and xu 2006 especially the theoretical energy for water dissociation in the bipolar membrane is 79 9 kj mol which is significantly lower than that of the electrolysis process 198 5 kj mol jiang et al 2019 which indicates water dissociation by bmed is a greener process with lower consumption chabi et al 2017 1 h 2 o h o h 2 c h 3 oh c h 3 o h as depicted in fig 3 the salt solution named as mn with mm as cations and nn as anions passes through a salt chamber between the aem and cem arrangement and is ionized into mm and nn in a typical three chamber bmed system tongwen 2002 meanwhile water molecules diffuse through the ion exchange membranes of bpm into the catalytic layer accompanying with the water dissociation h cross the cem and combine with anions migrated from the salt chamber to form the corresponding acid in acid chamber pärnamäe et al 2021 similarly oh migrate into the alkali chamber with the cations from the salt chamber in the form of related alkali as a result the simultaneous generation of acids and alkalis from salt solutions is the main application of bmed pärnamäe et al 2021 especially the obtained products are generally more valuable compared with salts which will be further discussed in section 3 3 so bmed method was extensively utilized in saline wastewater treatment to increase the process benefits as shown in eqs 3 8 the conversion of salts such as nacl jiang et al 2021 libr gao et al 2021b na2so4 monat et al 2020 nah2po2 qiu et al 2019 li2b4o7 bunani et al 2017 to acids and alkalis by bmed has been reported by previous studies 3 n a o h naoh 4 c l h hcl 5 l i o h lioh 6 b r h hbr 7 h 2 po 2 h h 3 p o 2 8 b oh 4 h h 3 b o 3 h 2 o nevertheless the acid concentration was generally slightly lower than alkali concentration during simultaneous acid alkali production by bmed it could be ascribed to the higher mobility rate of h than that of oh ions resulting in higher leakage of h ions through anion exchange membranes monat et al 2020 qiu et al 2019 zhang et al 2017a furthermore the lower barrier capacity of aem for h ions than cem for oh ions was also reported as an important reason wang et al 2012 3 2 low grade waste salt to high value acid and alkali as illustrated in the last section bmed could treat saline wastewater and utilize the contained salts to generate usable acids and alkalis which has potential economic benefits by resource regeneration benefitting from this property the components handled by bmed process are abundant including inorganic and organic systems for convenience and straightforward explanation the applied bmed processes were classified according to their products into these four following categories 1 inorganic acid inorganic alkali 2 organic acid inorganic alkali 3 inorganic acid organic alkali 4 organic acid organic alkali 3 2 1 inorganic acid inorganic alkali hcl naoh generation bmed has been widely applied to treat inorganic saline wastewater to regenerate acids and alkalis one of the most widespread applications is the treatment of nacl predominant high salinity wastewater including ro brine du et al 2021 ibáñez et al 2013 wang et al 2014 yang et al 2014 pretreated leachates ilhan et al 2017 and textile wastewater liu et al 2015 although nacl in the wastewater is of low utilization benefits the economic performance could be enhanced by converting it into hcl and naoh resources as illustrated in table 1 ortiz et al investigated a technically alternative option for producing hcl and naoh solutions of more than 1 0 m with current efficiencies of approximately 60 90 by bmed ibáñez et al 2013 ibanez et al utilized ro brine as wastewater and increased the concentrations of the hcl and naoh products to 3 3 m and 3 6 m respectively herrero gonzalez et al 2020 nevertheless there were generally ions with higher valent such as ca2 and mg2 in nacl wastewater under this circumstance softening pretreatment was carried out by a combination of ed and monovalent cation exchange membranes followed by the preparation of acids and alkalis by bmed wang et al 2014 to further simplify this process and improve the performance selective electrodialysis sed was introduced into bmed which could be utilized to obtain highly pure naoh and hcl solutions from concentrated brine chen et al 2018 with the in depth study of the bmed mechanism new strategies have been proposed and validated for complex systems containing multivalent ions the proton leakage was used to avoid the deposition of divalent ions on the membrane surface during the treatment of ro brine with hardness ions after the bmed process 0 6 m naoh solution and 0 7 m hcl solution with relatively high purity were obtained song et al 2021 furthermore bmed has also been gradually applied to practical ro brine treatment brackish water from jinhai lake in tianjin china was treated in the bmed system with bem aem cem membrane stack configuration where 0 7 m hcl and 0 6 m naoh could be generated simultaneously du et al 2021 compared with the ro brine some textile printing and dyeing wastewater also contain high salinity and they are also potential raw materials for acids and alkalis by bmed as shown in table 1 textile printing and dyeing wastewater have also been converted through bmed to produce high value acid and alkali products chen et al 2020 ilhan et al 2017 shen et al 2014 for example simulated textile wastewater was treated by bmed system to extract resources during which 1 28 m naoh and 1 19 m hcl solutions were obtained at constant voltage mode berkessa et al 2019 lin et al 2015b h2so4 naoh generation except for the bmed processes to obtain hcl and naoh another acid alkali combination commonly produced via bmed are h2so4 and naoh the specific details were summarized in table 2 which were mainly sourced from saline textile wastewater berkessa et al 2019 lin et al 2019 concentrated na2so4 stream gao et al 2021a monat et al 2020 tian et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 and cold rolling wastewater jiang et al 2021 in general textile wastewater has a high salinity e g 5 0 wt na2so4 and it could be considered as a potential resource lin et al 2015a 2015c mccarty et al 2011 as depicted in table 2 zhang et al treated the textile wastewater with salt and organic contents by bmed and obtained 0 236 m h2so4 and 0 507 m naoh berkessa et al 2019 furthermore ye et al used highly saline textile wastewater after ultrafiltration to produce 0 29 m h2so4 and 0 4 m naoh lin et al 2019 during this process water migration was found to limit the final acid alkali concentrations as na and so4 2 migrated across the membranes in the form of hydrated ions moreover jiang et al used higher salinity cold rolling wastewater to obtain 2 35 m h2so4 and 2 03 m naoh by adjusting the volume ratios of the solution in each chamber further confirming the excellent inorganic acid and alkali production performance of bmed jiang et al 2021 in addition to product concentration energy consumption and purity are also the main indicators for assessing the economic performance of bmed process as seen in table 2 the lowest energy consumption in the treatment of sodium sulfate wastewater was 1 4 kwh kg na2so4 and the purity of both acid and alkali was as high as 98 gao et al 2021a especially the separation of univalent and divalent anions has also been achieved in bmed to increase the product purity of a complex system by assembling monovalent selective anion exchange membranes msaem into bmed stacks xu et al separated the mixed salts into naoh monoprotic acid hcl and diprotic acid h2so4 with relatively high purity realizing purification of mixed acids yan et al 2020a nevertheless there is trade off between product concentration and energy consumption to address this issue chaudhury et al proposed a two step intermittent bmed process to balance the trade off which could obtain 3 6 m naoh and reduce chemical costs by 50 monat et al 2020 other inorganic acids inorganic alkalis the complexity of chemical processes determines the diversity of the main salts in high salinity wastewater abundant studies on the preparation of inorganic acids and alkalis from different sources e g pure low value salt solutions high salinity wastewater after pre treatment have been reported as shown in table 3 specific liquid salts include nh4 2so4 nabr na2b4o7 nh4cl li2b4o7 5h2o nah2po2 lici nh4 2moo4 could be recycled to generate corresponding acids and alkalis such as h2so4 nh4oh naohhbr naohh3bo3 nh4ohhcl liohh3bo3 and naohh3po2 bunani et al 2017 gao et al 2021b li et al 2016 nagasawa et al 2011 yan et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 2008 among them wastewater containing ammonia chloride receives special attention since ammonia nitrogen pollution has become a serious environmental concern in many countries nevertheless nh3 h2o chamber generally has high resistance which inhibits the performance of bmed zhao et al 2022 to avoid this problem shi et al modified the membrane stack of the bmed from three chamber to two chamber which could obviously reduce energy consumption and obtain 1 47 m hcl and 1 31 m nh3 h2o li et al 2016 in addition to wastewater a wide range of inorganic salts are also available as the inexpensive sources to produce high value inorganic acids and alkalis currently sodium hypophosphite nah2po2 is a potentially cheap raw material to produce hypophosphorous acid h3po2 which is an important chemical product for electroless nickel plating qiu et al 2019 yan et al 2019 considering environmental protection and efficiency issues bmed has the potential to be an alternative method for producing h3po2 for example shen et al integrated bmed with ion exchange adsorption to remove the leakage of na ions and 4 15 m h3po2 and 4 32 m naoh were finally obtained qiu et al 2019 except for this system other salts containing lithium bromine ammonium or boron have also been successfully converted to the corresponding acids and alkalis li et al 2016 lv et al 2018 nagasawa et al 2011 wei et al 2011 zhang et al 2008 as illustrated in table 3 3 2 2 organic acid inorganic alkali other than inorganic salt systems organic salts widely present in high salinity wastewater which could also be treated by bmed moreover the conversion of organic salts using bmed has no special requirements for pumps and spacers since the generated acid has much weaker corrosivity wang et al 2020 the details about the production of organic acids and inorganic alkalis by bmed were summarized in table 4 among the various organic salts sodium formate nacooh is one of the most common salts as its precursor formic acid hcooh is widely used in industries such as textiles natural rubber and leathering ferrer et al 2006 for this circumstance rakib et al researched the extraction of hcooh from nacooh wastewater by bmed and obtained 7 5 m hcooh with energy consumption of 2 6 kwh kg ferrer et al 2006 furthermore xu et al evaluated the economic performance of recovering hcooh from wastewater containing neopentyl glycol npg and the result showed the cost was 1 304 kg hcooh wei et al 2021 similar with formate system the preparation of acetic acid ch3cooh and naoh from sodium acetate residues by bmed has been investigated with the energy consumption of 6 0 19 2 kwh kg for ch3cooh and 8 9 26 2 kwh kg for naoh xue et al 2018 compared with the generation of inorganic acid and alkali via bmed du et al 2021 qiu et al 2019 further research might be performed to reduce the energy consumption for the organic systems different with the small organic acid molecules mentioned above the recovery of macromolecular organics by bmed is a challenge considering their low migrate mobility across aem which might result in higher energy consumption to address this situation the performance especially the energy consumption of bmed could be optimized in two ways including 1 promoting the dissociation of weak acid so that high conductivity and high concentration gradient of the solution would accelerate diffusive transport of ions szczygiełda and prochaska 2017 2 avoiding the migration of ions with large hydration radius across aem by modulating membrane arrangements lei et al 2020 for the first case prochaska et al investigated the generation of alpha ketoglutaric acid akg from sodium alpha ketoglutarate via bmed szczygiełda and prochaska 2017 as shown in eqs 9 10 the dissociation of akg acid reached a maximum level with ph higher than 7 so that the dissociation could be promoted in the alkaline environment szczygiełda and prochaska 2017 for the second situation an example was analyzed via the gluconate ions glu system glu has large ion radius and is difficult to cross the aem resulting in unsatisfied current efficiency and conversion rate lei et al 2020 li et al studied the production of gluconic acid hglu from sodium gluconate naglu and adopted membrane stack into bpm cem to avoid the transmembrane of glu lei et al 2020 during this process the energy consumption could be reduced by half compared with bpm aem and bpm aem cem configurations lei et al 2020 however the bpm cem two chamber arrangement would lead to the mixing of the feed solution and product streams thus reducing the purity of the products except for the salts mentioned above bmed is also available for the regeneration of other large weight organics with significant environmental and economic advantages including niacin li et al 2015 methionine jiang et al 2016 fumaric acid prochaska and woźniak budych 2014 alpha ketoglutaric acid szczygiełda and prochaska 2017 2021 l lactic acid lameloise and lewandowski 2012 ma et al 2019 succinic acid szczygiełda et al 2017 and citric acid sun et al 2017 above all bmed would be a competitive candidate in the preparation and recovery of organic acids and inorganic alkalis to achieve high value conversion of saline wastewaters and cheap salts 9 h 2 akg hak g h k a 1 3 4 10 3 10 hak g ak g 2 h k a 2 2 1 10 5 3 2 3 inorganic acid organic alkali similar with the organic acid inorganic alkali generating processes bmed has also been applied to the preparation of inorganic acid and organic alkalis as shown in table 5 most of the organic alkalis prepared by bmed were derived from halogen salts due to the high solubility and ionization ability of such salts miao et al 2018 yao et al 2020 considering some of the halogen ions might permeate across the bpm into the alkali chamber so the purity of the organic alkalis might be reduced for example shen et al used bpm cem aem cem membrane stack to regenerate tetrapropyl ammonium hydroxide tpaoh and hbr from tetrapropyl ammonium bromine tpabr with 91 6 conversion ratio shen et al 2013a moreover this membrane stack configuration was also used by shen et al to extract choline hydroxide from choline chloride with higher purity 321 75 ppm cl in the 45 wt choline hydroxides aqueous solution and the energy consumption was calculated as 0 7444 kwh kg choline hydroxide yao et al 2020 furthermore xu et al obtained the methyl methoxyacetate from methyl chloroacetate by bmed through alcohol splitting as shown in eq 11 li et al 2011 11 clc h 2 cooc h 3 c h 3 o c h 3 oc h 2 cooc h 3 c l 3 2 4 organic acid organic alkali compared to the applications of bmed in the preparation of inorganic acids inorganic alkalis inorganic acids organic alkalis and organic acids inorganic alkalis there was less research in the simultaneous generation of organic acids and alkalis from saline wastewaters and cheap salts recently a study of shen et al reported the treatment of s 2 amino 1 butanol l tartaric solution by bmed to obtain chiral s 2 amino 1 butanol and l tartaric acid as shown in fig 4 a lv et al 2021 based on this the s 2 amino 1 butanol would react with l tartaric acid to generate s 2 amino 1 butanol l tartaric for subsequent bmed operation achieving the closed production loops in fig 4 b during this process chiral s 2 amino 1 butanol 1 04 m with purity of approximately 98 2 was obtained accompanying with a current efficiency of 54 05 and energy consumption of 1 88 kwh kg s 2 amino 1 butanol respectively lv et al 2021 over the summary of various acid and alkali production by bmed it s suggested more attention should be gave for complex high salinity wastewater furthermore scale up experiments would be recommended to explore industrial production 3 3 economic analysis compared to the enrichment of salt solutions from high salinity wastewater bmed directly converts salt resources into the corresponding valuable acids and alkalis which would significantly improve the economic benefits of resource utilization theoretically herein we outlined an economic analysis of bmed for the conversion of low grade salts into valuable acids and alkalis the prices of process chemicals total costs and treatment capacities were summarized and the results are shown in table 6 as shown in table 6 the total process cost for the recovery of acids and alkalis from salts via bmed mainly includes total energy cost and investment cost the energy cost mainly relates to the energy consumption of the actual bmed process and local electricity charge at present the price of industrial electricity in china is almost 0 08 0 1 kwh qiu et al 2019 wei et al 2021 yan et al 2018 under this situation the total energy cost is mostly dependent on the energy consumption parameters of the bmed process the energy cost column in table 6 displays that hcooh lioh and h3po2 have significantly higher energy costs than hcl and naoh which could be contributed to their lower solubility and hydrolysis properties qiu et al 2019 on the other hand the total investment cost consists of membrane stack cost and peripheral cost qiu et al 2019 it could be found that the corresponding investment costs varied considerably among different types of products which could be ascribed to their different membrane stack membrane type and especially treatment capacity with the increment of the treatment capacity the total investment cost could be significantly reduced and the prices variance between generated acids alkalis and original salts obviously exceeds the total energy cost much this result further implies the potential economic benefits of the bmed processes furthermore considering the potential applications of bmed in wastewater treatment plants there would be almost no raw material cost and even negative cost due to the disposal fees of saline wastewater so the economic profits of the bmed would further increase under this condition to further clarify the process economy an industry scale process from table 6 for extracting h3po2 and naoh from nah2po2 was analyzed the recovery of h3po2 from nah2po2 displays outstanding economic benefits as the sum of the h3po2 price 12 142 86 t and naoh price 179 71 t is significantly larger than the sum of nah2po2 5000 t and total process cost 0 937 kg h3po2 qiu et al 2019 furthermore compared with the traditional ed the oxidization of h3po2 could be avoided in bmed process to ensure the purity qiu et al 2019 above all by comparing the prices of salts and acids bases as well as the total process cost of bmed process it could be found that the utilization of bmed for saline wastewater treatment has significant economic advantages 4 in situ utilization of acid and alkali considering the excellent acid and alkali producing performance environmental effects and economic benefits bmed has been in situ integrated with chemical processes that have special requirements for acids and alkalis moreover in situ utilization will reduce transport costs and enable deeper utilization of the bmed products according to the utilization form it could be divided into the in situ utilization of acid and in situ utilization of alkali generated by bmed 4 1 in situ utilization of acid generated by bmed in situ applications of acid produced by bmed are relatively rare and mainly utilized to extract co2 from seawater as shown in eq 12 for example iizuka et al realized the collection of co2 from carbonate solution via the acid produced by bmed and the regeneration of naoh at the same time iizuka et al 2012 nagasawa et al 2009 moreover xu et al used acid generated by bmed to simultaneously prepare methionine and achieve co2 extraction from methionine salts jiang et al 2017 similar with the extraction process of co2 the electro acidification process has also been used in the acidification purification of soybean protein ali et al 2010 mondor et al used the produced acid by bmed to improve the extraction of soy protein when the ph was reduced from 9 to 4 5 ali et al 2010 12 co 3 2 2 h hco 3 h c o 2 h 2 o the acid solutions produced by bmed was also in situ integrated with other electrochemical processes to obtain coupled electrochemical systems for example xiang et al adopted bmed coupled with a co2 reduction cell to extract and convert co2 from seawater by the generated acid and the schematic illustration is shown in fig 5 a digdaya et al 2020 during this process the co2 capture efficiency was 71 when the current density and seawater flow rate were 3 3 ma cm2 and 37 ml min respectively as depicted in the fig 5 b digdaya et al 2020 4 2 in situ utilization of alkali generated by bmed different from the applications of acid some studies have investigated the in situ applications of alkali from bmed since the generated alkalis are more versatile and convenient to be integrated chen et al 2021b zhao et al 2020b among them the in situ utilization of alkaline streams of bmed for the absorption of acidic gases is widely used especially coupled with carbon capture utilization and storage ccus which is considered as a highly potential technique for carbon neutrality chen et al 2022b tapia et al 2018 zhao et al proposed a membrane arrangement with novel bpm aem aem structure which could in situ utilize the generated alkalis to fix co2 and further mineralize it into functional caco3 zhao et al 2020b as shown in fig 6 a co2 gas was fluxed into the solution of the alkali chamber eqs 13 14 and hco3 and co3 2 ions were obtained eqs 15 16 then these anions would migrate across aem into the salt chamber under the electric field and be precipitated as functional caco3 eq 17 zhao et al 2020b on this foundation co2 was also reported to be captured by the generated alkali via bmed in the form of nesquehonite materials eq 18 chen et al 2022b under the optimum condition the carbon absorption ratio and the magnesium extraction ratio reached 50 85 and 56 71 respectively chen et al 2022b 13 c o 2 g c o 2 aq 14 c o 2 aq h 2 o h 2 c o 3 15 h 2 c o 3 o h hco 3 h 2 o 16 hco 3 o h h 2 o co 3 2 17 c a 2 co 3 2 cac o 3 s 18 m g 2 co 3 2 3 h 2 o mgc o 3 3 h 2 o s similar with the utilization of alkaline solutions for co2 absorption the alkaline streams of bmed have also been applied to the desulphurization of simulated flue gases displaying the versatile in situ applications of alkaline products for acid gas absorption zhao et al 2020c in general bmed could achieve in situ utilization of produced alkali solution by capturing acid gases especially co2 which could be further mineralized in the form of high value added carbonate products nevertheless the energy consumption of caco3 6 46 kwh kg is higher compared to that of naoh generation 1 81 kwh kg to enhance the economic performance zhao et al proposed self crystallization strategy to reduce the energy consumption through the investigation of ion migration rate in fig 6 b chen et al 2021b as illustrated in fig 6 c the energy consumption for treating seawater was reduced by 70 29 from 4 78 to 1 42 kwh t chen et al 2021b as a result it should be mentioned that more attention should be paid to process energy consumption control and membrane fouling prevention in addition to the absorption of acidic gases alkali generated by bmed could also be in situ used for the production of inorganic polymer coagulants zhang et al 2017b dehydrohalogenation reactions and ionic liquid recovery milewski et al 2019 zhang et al used the alkali produced by bpm aem configuration to prepare high alkalinity polymerized ferric sulphate pfs with the basicity attains of 14 72 zhang et al 2017b furthermore andrzej et al developed a method for the synthesis of glycidol from 3 chloro 1 2 propanediol by dehydrohalogenation with in situ production of oh ions by the bpm milewski et al 2019 apart from that the alkali generated by bmed could be used to regenerate the desulphurizing agents as well as the ionic liquids huang et al 2007 liang et al 2020 as illustrated in fig 7 triethylammonium hydrogen sulfate tea hso4 was dissociated in the alkali chamber into tea and hso4 benefiting from the migration of hso4 into the acid chamber the tea and so4 2 could be recovered with ratios of 93 7 and 96 4 during this process respectively liang et al 2020 5 influencing factors during the generation of acids and alkalis by bmed and their deep in situ applications as described above different operating conditions would have significant impacts on the whole process especially the performance and energy consumption these factors mainly include current density initial solution concentration configuration of membrane stack temperature initial volume ratio and electrode solution herein the critical analysis and comparison of these influencing factors were summarized in table 7 5 1 current density constant current operation has been commonly used in bmed processes where the current density is determined by the current applied at both ends of the membrane stack and the effective area of the applied membranes based on the previous studies the influences of current density on bmed could be summarized into four aspects 1 water dissociation 2 ion migration rate 3 operating time and 4 energy consumption according to the second wien effect the water dissociation of the catalytic layer in the bipolar membrane is mainly determined by the strength of the applied electric field pärnamäe et al 2021 besides the water dissociation would increase at high electric fields due to more water being dissociated in the bipolar membrane jiang et al 2014 wei et al 2011 based on these deduction zhao et al investigated the relationship between oh generation rate and current density which exhibited a positive correlation as shown in fig 8 a chen et al 2021b other than water dissociation another important effect originated from the current density is the ion migration rate briefly speaking the increased current density would promote ion migration rate and thus more ions could be transmitted across the membrane wei et al 2022 du et al and ortiz et al concluded that an increase in current density would accelerate the rate of ion migration thereby increased the yield of hcl and naoh at the same operating time du et al 2021 mier et al 2008 the phenomenon above could be further verified by the fact that the concentration of both acid and alkali increased with the current density at the same moment as shown in fig 8b sun et al 2022 on the other hand the increment of current density would promote the migration rate so that it would also contribute to the reduction of operating time at certain saline concentrations for example li et al observed the operation time was reduced from 120 min to 60 min after the current density was increased from 38 to 54 ma cm2 during the extraction of hcl and nh3 h2o from nh4cl by bmed li et al 2016 furthermore shen et al found that higher current densities resulted in lower voltage drops during bmed operation which is an essential factor to the impact of current density shen et al 2013b likewise sun et al found the operation time was reduced by half when the current density was increased from 30 to 70 ma cm2 in treating the high salinity sulfanilic acid wastewater as shown in fig 8c sun et al 2022 nevertheless the elevation of current density would also increase the energy consumption so the reasonable assessment of energy consumption is essential energy consumption represents economic performance as an important indicator of bmed process which has a strong relationship with current density lu et al 2020 yan et al 2020b as illustrated in fig 8 d the energy consumption of both acid and alkali production increased as the rising of current density generally the increment of current density induces enlarged energy consumption owing to a large proportion of total electrical energy being converted into joule heat eisaman et al 2012 similar results on the relationship of energy consumption and current density have been reported by gao et al 2021b liu et al 2020 wei et al 2022 yan et al 2019 on the other hand as another essential energy parameter for bmed current efficiency is actually determined by the combination of the current density and concentrations of the acid and alkali which could be understood as the actual consumption of electrons for the products as observed in fig 8 d the current efficiency decreased with the increment of current density wu et al demonstrated that the current efficiency decreased from 94 1 to 76 2 with the current density was increased from 30 to 70 ma cm2 for the generation of ch3cooh and naoh xue et al 2018 similarly gao et al also found a decrease in current efficiency from 91 61 at 10 ma cm2 to 83 02 at 50 ma cm2 for the production of hbr and lioh gao et al 2021b 5 2 initial solution concentration during bmed operations the initial concentrations of the salt acid alkali chamber solutions play an important role on the final acid alkali concentrations and energy consumption the corresponding influence could be summarized into two categories 1 the influence of initial salt concentration 2 the effect of initial concentrations in acid and alkali chambers 5 2 1 influence of initial salt concentration there are mainly three aspects of the influence of initial salt solution concentration during bmed process including the final concentrations of acid alkali products the solution volume of each chamber and energy consumption among that the influence on final concentrations of acid alkali products is the most significant for example chen et al investigated the generation of lioh and h2so4 from li2so4 and found with the initial li2so4 solution elevated from 0 5 m to 1 5 m the concentrations of acid alkali would increase from 0 49 m and 0 94 m to 1 23 m and 2 16 m respectively chen et al 2021c furthermore monat et al explored the generation of naoh and h2so4 from na2so4 and the concentrations of both acid and alkali increased as the rising of initial salt concentration 0 7 2 m monat et al 2020 the similar results were also reported in the system to produce h3po2 and naoh from nah2po2 during bmed qiu et al 2019 yan et al 2019 in general an appropriate increase of the initial salt concentration is beneficial for obtaining higher concentrations of acid and alkali solutions nevertheless with the further elevation of the initial concentration the products concentration cannot be continuously increased since the restriction of the membrane process during the bmed process of hno3 and naoh from nano3 raissouni et al found that the concentrations of hno3 and naoh reached a plateau when the concentration of nano3 continued to rise from 1 2 m to 3 m raissouni et al 2007 this phenomenon could be attributed to two main reasons 1 leakage of h and oh through anion and cation exchange membranes and 2 the migration of water through aem and cem into acid and alkali chambers raissouni et al 2007 moreover the water migration during bmed process would also result in the change of solution volume which was caused by electroosmosis driven water migration and concentration diffusion jiang et al 2015 the water migration during bmed could mainly be described as the ion migration in form of hydrated ions inducing the increment of acid and alkali volumes tanaka 2004 therefore higher concentration differences between the salt and alkali chambers would improve the driving force for the migration of water molecules thus the significant change of solution volume ye et al 2015 according to a study on the extraction of lioh and hcl from brine the volume of acid alkali solutions has a positive linear trend with the salt chamber concentration fig 9 a zhao et al 2020a for the economical parameters the increment of initial salt solution could reduce the energy consumption by increasing the concentration of products for example gao et al researched the energy consumption of libr during bmed process it decreased when the concentration of libr increased from 0 1 m to 0 5 m gao et al 2021b furthermore li et al also found the higher initial concentration of nh4cl was favored to reduce the unit energy consumption of hcl and nh3 h2o produced by bmed li et al 2016 5 2 2 influence of initial acid alkali concentrations the initial acid alkali solution concentrations also have influence on the final concentrations of acid alkali products the solution volume of each chamber current efficiency acid and alkali conversion ratios and desalination rate during bmed process the initial acid alkali solution concentrations have similar impacts with the initial salt concentration on the solution volume of each chamber and current efficiency for example song et al found that naoh with higher concentrations more than 2 m could be generated from brine when the initial alkali concentration increased from 0 to 2 m and the volume variations of alkali chamber solution increased from 4 to 22 as the rising of initial naoh concentrations song et al 2021 on the other hand raissouni et al demonstrated that current efficiency decreased from 85 to 54 for naoh and from 78 to 38 for hno3 when the initial acid and alkali concentration increased from 1 to 3 m raissouni et al 2007 similarly as shown in fig 9 b for the system recovering hcl and naoh from saline wastewater by bmed the current efficiency decreased slightly with increasing initial acid alkali concentrations sun et al 2022 in addition to the factors above öner et al found that the increment of initial acid alkali solution concentrations would decrease the desalination rate and acid alkali conversion ratios when extracted nh3 h2o and hcl from nh4cl öner et al 2021 this phenomenon could be attributed that high initial acid and alkali concentrations led to increase potential differences for back diffusion of the ions 5 3 configuration of membrane stack bmed is typically performed in two chamber guo et al 2021 lv et al 2018 nagasawa et al 2011 wei et al 2013 and three chamber configurations gao et al 2021a li et al 2011 monat et al 2020 qiu et al 2019 zhao et al 2021 to optimize the extraction and utilization of resources membrane stack configurations with multiple compartments have also been proposed with the progressive development of bmed technology shen et al 2013a the reported membrane stack arrangement of bmed have been summarized in fig 10 as shown in fig 10 a and fig 10 b two chamber membrane stack configurations bpm cem and bpm aem are generally used for acid alkali production and utilization lameloise and lewandowski 2012 li et al 2016 szczygiełda and prochaska 2017 wei et al 2013 guo et al used a bpm cem membrane stack to recovery ammonia and obtain high purity nh4 2so4 from low grade sulfuric acid guo et al 2021 similarly bpm aem membrane stack configuration system was applied to obtain h3bo3 and naoh from the aqueous solution and more than 90 of the boron was removed in this system nagasawa et al 2011 in addition to the preparation of inorganic acids and alkalis two chamber bmed offers unique advantages for the preparation of weak acids or alkalis it is generally considered that two chamber configuration is the best cell structure for the conversion of organic salts into the corresponding acids by bmed wang et al 2011 2010 because the salt solution could be mixed with organic acid solution in one chamber to increase conductivity and reduce energy consumption furthermore it also avoids transmembrane migration of macromolecules which would inhibit the potential membrane pollution lei et al 2020 zheng et al 2022 for example a variety of organic acids including l lactic acid methionine and niacin were prepared by bpm cem configuration as depicted in section 3 2 2 jiang et al 2016 li et al 2015 ma et al 2019 however two chamber configuration would reduce the purity of bmed products due to the existence of mixed chamber to address this situation another ion exchange membrane was introduced into the two chamber system to mitigate leakage of impurity ions and thus the three chamber stack was fabricated compared with two chamber stack three chamber bmed system fig 10c and fig 10d generates or recovers two product streams acid and alkali with high purity having been extensively utilized in resource conversion of multiple salt solutions including nacl du et al 2021 ibáñez et al 2013 na2so4 monat et al 2020 nh4 2so4 zhang et al 2008 nah2po2 qiu et al 2019 yan et al 2019 and ch3coona bunani et al 2017 based on the traditional two chamber electrodialysis bpm aem bpm cem and three chamber electrodialysis bpm aem cem bpm cem aem aem bpm cem ferrer et al 2006 gutiérrez et al 2013 xue et al 2018 new membrane stack structures such as bpm aem aem fig 10e have also been proposed to in situ integrate co2 capture by bmed chen et al 2022b zhao et al 2020b for those systems containing mono valent and bi valent ions a four chamber electrodialysis system was proposed by introducing monovalent selective membrane which promoted the selective recovery of resources from high salinity wastewater as depicted in fig 10 f xu et al adopted the four chamber stack and thus the cl so4 2 could be simultaneously separated and converted into high purity hcl and h2so4 by introducing a msaem into the bpm aem cem stack yan et al 2020a in practical bmed applications the complexity of the system often requires the comparison of multiple membrane stack configurations to determine the optimum configuration therefore we compared and summarized the effects of two chamber and three chamber membrane stack configurations on the acid alkali preparation and their applications in general two chamber stack would reduce the energy consumption of membrane stack for weak electrolytes compared to three chamber configuration for example li et al treated simulated nh4cl wastewater and compared the effect of bpm aem cem and bpm aem stack configuration on the production of hcl and nh3 h2o li et al 2016 during this process the two chamber system was found having faster conductivity drop and higher hcl concentration than the three chamber system resulting in higher current efficiency and lower energy consumption li et al 2016 similarly lei et al compared the effects of bpm cem bpm aem and bpm aem cem on the production of hglu and naoh from naglu lei et al 2020 it has been found that bpm cem had the best overall performance with the highest conversion and the lowest energy consumption 0 104 kg hglu in this process lei et al 2020 on the other hand three chamber stack configuration is generally used in the strong electrolyte systems du et al 2021 gao et al 2021a 2021b moreover the separate two product streams from the salt solutions improve the purity with lower resistance of the membrane stack due to the higher dissociation for instance wang et al used a bpm aem cem membrane stack configuration for the generation of l 10 camphorsulfonic acid l csa since l csa is a strong electrolyte with high dissociation constant yan et al 2022 5 4 temperature temperature would affect bmed system through two effects 1 the dissociation of water in the bipolar membrane into h and oh 2 the rate of ion migration across the membranes for the water dissociation it has been pointed that the kinetics of water dissociation in bpm would be enhanced with elevated temperature alcaraz et al 2001 ramírez et al 1992 however the thermal stability limits high temperature process as commercial bpm cannot withstand temperatures above 40 60 c for long duration pärnamäe et al 2021 sharifian et al 2021 therefore the study on the high temperature performance of bpm is scarce for the trans membrane process the increase of temperature 35 c to 55 c led to an increase in ion migration and thus higher conductivity in the acid and alkali chambers which would improve process current efficiency and reduce energy consumption haddad et al 2016 zhao et al found that the increment of temperature from 20 c to 30 c promoted the transmembrane migration rate of co3 2 ions and reduced the energy consumption when co2 was in situ captured by bmed chen et al 2021b 5 5 initial volume ratio the modulation of initial solution volume ratio is an effective way to obtain product with higher concentration lu et al 2020 in this section the discussion would be categorized into changing the volume ratios of two chambers or three chambers of bmed for the first case yan et al explored the influence of different volume ratios between acid and alkali chambers on the product concentrations it was found that the final hcl concentration increased from 1 95 m to 2 71 m when the ratios decreased from 1 00 to 0 50 lv et al 2018 similarly li et al found that rising ratios of salt to acid chamber or salt to alkali chamber could not only increase the concentration of hcl 29 2 to 48 18 g l and nh3 h2o 26 25 to 43 05 g l but reduce current efficiency and energy consumption li et al 2016 this phenomenon could be ascribed to that the larger volume ratios between salt and product chambers resulted in lower resistance of membrane stack liu et al 2022 the principle of changing the volume ratio of the three chambers is essentially the same as the two chambers condition for instance song et al indicated that when the volume ratios of salt acid and alkali were 5 5 3 5 5 2 and 10 5 2 respectively the concentrations of naoh were 1 2 1 6 and 2 4 m respectively song et al 2021 this suggested that the increment of salt chamber volume ratio and reduction of alkali chamber volume ratio would produce naoh solution with higher concentration song et al 2021 5 6 electrode solution the type of anode or cathode solution electrode solution also has an impact on product purity and energy consumption during bmed processes the choice of electrolyte solutions for the bmed process is based on three main reasons 1 excellent conductivity 2 absence of impurities 3 avoiding membrane fouling or pollution in general nacl dursun et al 2021 na2so4 lv et al 2021 xue et al 2018 yan et al 2019 nano3 chen et al 2022b 2021b are the most commomly used during bmed processes among that it is worth noting that for these systems containing hardness ions such as ca ⅱ and mg ⅱ nano3 was generally chosen as the electrode solution to avoid precipitation chen et al 2022b kravtsov et al 2020 merkel et al 2018 zhao et al 2020c kanca et al first reported the effects of electrolytes concentration on acid and alkali production the conversion rate and the purity for the regeneration of hcl and naoh from binary salt water dursun et al 2021 during this study it was found that higher concentrations of electrolytes resulted in higher product purity and lower energy consumption dursun et al 2021 6 strategies for improving bmed performance 6 1 energy consumption reduction energy consumption is an important indicator for bmed which represents the economic performance of the whole process in particular considering the low hydrolysis degree in weak electrolytes bmed systems these systems generally suffer from higher energy consumption compared with strong electrolytes therefore the improvement of process efficiency and reduction of energy consumption is essential for weak electrolytes bmed systems in the production of weak electrolytes higher energy is consumed due to the poorer conductivity and thus larger resistance of membrane stack for this situation liu at al added the resins to form conductive chains and accelerate ion transportation and it could be considered as an effective method for improving the electrical conductivity of the solution liu et al 2015 furthermore zhang et al studied the effect of adding resins into the chambers and found that the energy consumption decreased from 5 6 kwh kg to 0 6 kwh kg for recovery of acetic acid from simulated acetaldehyde wastewater zhang et al 2011 similarly wu et al reduced the energy consumption from 11 48 to 8 75 kwh kg for ch3cooh and 20 66 to 14 14 kwh kg for naoh by adding strong alkali resins when utilization of ch3coona waste residue xue et al 2015 other than adding resins in situ method by introducing self crystallization during bmed was proposed by zhao et al which decreased almost 76 energy consumption chen et al 2021b 6 2 multi stage operational strategy for the recovery of resources in complex systems through bmed two stage bmed has been proposed to recycle resources step by step two stage bmed is a process that produces separate types of acid or alkali to improve the concentration and purity of the product in a complex system shi et al 2018 for the example in fig 11 a shi et al proposed a novel two stage operational strategy to separate po4 3 volatile fatty acids vfas from cl so4 2 by bmed shi et al 2018 it should be noted that after the voltage started to increase significantly at the inflection point the depletion of strong acidic ions both the alkali and acid chamber solutions were replaced with deionized water shi et al 2018 as illustrated in fig 11 b and fig 11 c two solutions of different compositions and concentrations of alkali alkali i alkali ii and acid acid i and acid ii were produced and the recovery yield of nh4 increased from 52 to 78 shi et al 2018 moreover a multi stage batch bmed process was designed and a maximum concentration of 3 40 m was obtained in the second stage of bmed process hussain et al 2021 therefore multi stage operational strategy could be considered for applications such as the enhancement of product concentrations and the stepwise utilization of ions in bmed systems 6 3 model optimization for bmed although bmed has been extensively researched further research is still needed to predict its functionality to optimize the system and eventually scale it up to an industrial level szczygiełda and prochaska 2017 in this section the modeling of bmed could be categorized as leakage of current efficiency and comprehensive process 6 3 1 leakage of current efficiency current could bypass the effective area of the membranes in bmed due to the potential difference between adjacent compartments resulting in a loss of current efficiency peng and sun 2020 peng et al developed mathematical model by using the current balance equation and the potential balance equation through multisim software for predicting the leakage current peng et al 2022 by using this model the performance of bmed could be improved by optimizing the spacer layers between the membrane stacks peng et al 2022 6 3 2 comprehensive process recently model optimization for bmed about the comprehensive process has also been developed culcasi et al proposed a comprehensive process model based on a multi scale approach with distributed parameters by the process simulator gproms model builder culcasi et al 2022 based on the process for the extraction of hcl and naoh solutions by bmed it has been simulated with a balanced cost of approximately 280 t naoh which demonstrated the enormous potential of industrialization culcasi et al 2022 furthermore lin et al developed a systematic framework based on performance trade off between energy efficiency and process kinetic rates of bmed processes lu et al 2020 7 future applications and prospects based on the summary above the future applications and prospects of bmed were considered including 1 at present large number of bmed applications were reported as batch operation and there was little investigation on continuous operation due to the complexity of the wastewater matrix pärnamäe et al 2021 this might limit the application of bmed and slow down its large scale industrialization inspired by the statements above the continuous bmed processes for different saline wastewater systems are needed to be further developed to facilitate the industrialization of bmed furthermore bmed also has the potential to be integrated with other processes such as electrodialysis metathesis to obtain acid and alkali in the practical industrial applications zhu et al 2022 therefore the research on the continuous bmed based integrated industrial processes is also important 2 during the long period of bmed operation it could be observed that the acid or alkali concentrations decreased as the proceeding of bmed zhao et al 2021 the reasons for the decrement of product concentration and process performance could be ascribed to the limitations of the ion leakage and water migration fernandez gonzalez et al 2016 however the principles for inhibiting ion leakage and water migration haven t been well explored on one hand ion leakage is mainly caused by co ion leakage and the most significant one is proton leakage in the bmed processes pärnamäe et al 2021 qiu et al 2021 zhang et al 2017b to avoid the drop of process performance caused by proton leakage it s suggested to investigate the mechanism and its influence on bmed processes on the other hand water migration originating from the transportation of hydrated ions would also lead to the decrement of product concentrations therefore the relations between hydration number and ions migration during water migration in bmed should appeal more attention 3 the in situ applications of acid and alkali generated by bmed were less reported and the published work were mainly focused on the extraction and capture of acid gases chen et al 2022b zhao et al 2020b considering the extensive requirements of acids and alkalis in chemical industry it is necessary to carry out further research on the in situ acid base integrated application of bmed especially it was observed during in situ applications that the energy consumption of bmed is relatively high chen et al 2022b 2021b noting that a significant part of the bmed cost originate from electricity consumption with the widespread use of clean energy including hydropower and wind power its applications in bmed processes would significantly improve the process economical parameters and enhance the development of bmed based in situ applications 8 conclusion in this review bmed was systematically discussed for high value conversion of saline wastewater based on environmental and economic benefits firstly the applications of bmed to produce acids and alkalis were detailed concluded according to the products intrinsic properties including inorganic acid inorganic alkali organic acid inorganic alkali inorganic acid organic alkali and organic acid organic alkali in addition the economic analysis of bmed processes for extracting acids and alkalis was outlined furthermore the deep in situ utilization of acid alkali generated by bmed were summarized the influence of the operating parameters on the performance of bmed were also reviewed including current density initial solution concentration configuration of membrane stack temperature initial volume ratios and electrode solution in addition methods for enhancing the electrodialysis performance of bipolar membranes were summarized finally considering the current development and application of bmed future applications and prospects for its applications in the saline wastewater resource utilization were presented

15330,with the development of comprehensive utilization of high salinity wastewater salt resources regeneration has been considered as the fundamental requirement for process sustainability and economic benefits as one of the potential candidates bipolar membrane electrodialysis bmed was rapidly developed in recent years for the treatment of saline wastewater different from other methods directly obtaining salts or condensed wastewater bmed could utilize and convert the dissolved waste salt into higher value acid and alkali simultaneously which has various advantages including outstanding environmental effects and economic benefits in this review the recent applications of bmed for waste salt recovery and high value acid alkali generation from saline wastewater were systematically outlined based on the summary above the economy analysis of bmed was further reviewed from the roles of desalination and resources recovery in addition the bmed based processes integrated with in situ utilization of the generated acid alkali resources were discussed furthermore the influence of operating factors on bmed performance were outlined finally the strategies for improving bmed performance were concluded furthermore the future application and prospects of bmed was presented this work would provide guidance for the applications of bipolar membrane

and industry the continuously increasing production of high salinity wastewater presents a significant challenge to both the environment maintenance and resources utilization chen et al 2022a the discharge of saline wastewater would significantly degrade water quality in the environment and thus water cannot be directly used for potable water and industrial applications panagopoulos 2022a 2022b to handle this situation effective treatment of high salinity wastewater was proposed to reduce the negative impacts of salts on the environment and offer a potential route for resources recycling chen et al 2022a lv et al 2022 shao et al 2019 during the treatment of saline wastewater the concept of minimal liquid discharge mld and zero liquid discharge zld have brought a revolution in recent years chen et al 2021a panagopoulos and giannika 2022 qiu et al 2021 tong and elimelech 2016 to meet the objectives of mld zld and achieve efficient salt recycling a range of technologies have been developed such as electrodialysis ed forward osmosis fo and membrane distillation md panagopoulos 2021 panagopoulos and haralambous 2020 among the various technologies ed technology has been widely used in the enrichment and recovery of liquid mineral resources from brine wastewater benefitting from its sustainable and efficient processing characteristics gmar and chagnes 2019 pei et al 2019 ye et al 2018 however ed only achieves solution separation into dilute and concentrated streams after which the concentrated salt solutions are usually crystallized into solid states nevertheless the solid salts are generally cheap compared with the process cost which encourages further research to utilize and upgrade the salt resources into more valuable products based on the traditional electrodialysis process bipolar membrane bpm was introduced to integrate water dissociation at the interface layer and thus bmed was fabricated bunani et al 2017 culcasi et al 2022 huang et al 2006 koter 2007 tian et al 2019 when current is applied to the bpm the ionic current through the membrane cannot be maintained in the bulk solution because neither cations nor anions could pass through the two membranes of the bpm pärnamäe et al 2021 as a result the dissociated h and oh would migrate across the cation exchange membrane cem and anion exchange membrane aem to maintain ionic current at the membrane interface respectively as a result by using bpm produced h and oh in a properly designed bmed membrane configuration salts could be successfully converted into acids and alkalis bmed technology has many advantages including no gas or byproduct generation higher energy utilization space saving and easier installation over traditional chemical technologies sun et al 2017 considering its environmental effects and cost effective benefits hung et al 2022 ye et al 2015 bmed has been emerged as an efficient and green technique in food process ali et al 2011 faucher et al 2020 rozoy et al 2015 co2 capture eisaman et al 2012 iizuka et al 2012 muroyama et al 2020 nagasawa et al 2009 patterson bruce et al 2019 comprehensive utilization of waste residue dai et al 2021 liang et al 2021 xue et al 2015 and high salinity wastewater treatment lin et al 2019 shen et al 2013b wei et al 2013 ye et al 2015 especially for the saline wastewater the contained low grade salts could be converted into concentrated acid and alkali solutions with higher values furthermore in the general industry acids and alkalis are usually used to a variety of acid base neutralization reactions therefore numerous attentions have also been focused on developing in situ reaction system by integrating bmed chambers and neutralization reactions to produce higher valuable chemical products in a unit operation currently significant breakthroughs on the preparation of acids alkalis via bmed have been achieved and some reviews on bmed have also been published for instance fernandez et al summarized the applications of bmed technology for the treatment of concentrated brine streams from reverse osmosis ro desalination and nacl rich industrial wastewater fernandez gonzalez et al 2016 moreover pärnamäe reviewed the mainly principles developments and applications about bpm pärnamäe et al 2021 different from the process oriented reviews above the electrochemical systems with bpm were reviewed by blommaert et al from the aspect of energy conversion blommaert et al 2021 nevertheless these contributions didn t outline the applications of bmed in saline wastewater especially from the role of resources utilization moreover there is no systematic contribution on the applications of bmed for high salinity wastewater treatment and its resources utilization therefore it is essential to review the reported work to provide theoretical and practical guidance for the future research in this review the applications of bmed for high salinity wastewater treatment and its resources utilization into valuable acids and alkalis were summarized based on the summary of acid alkali production by bmed the further in situ utilization of acid and alkali to fabricate integrated bmed processes was discussed furthermore the mechanism and the influence of operation factors during bmed including current density initial solution concentration configuration of membrane stack temperature initial volume ratios and type of electrode solution were outlined finally the prospects and research interests for bmed were also proposed 2 methodology 2 1 search strategy in this section the methodology and process of selecting relevant literature on the reviewed subject were elaborated according to boolean and position operators a literature search was carried out in a systematic manner to exhaustively identify all available literature on bmed based processes in this work fig 1 the literature research in this review mainly derived from two main databases scopus and web of science since these two databases covered a broad range of publications with large variability mongeon and paul hus 2016 as shown in fig 1 the keywords involved in this section could be divided into two parts in the scopus database the first part was consisted of bipolar membrane electrodialysis or bmed or edbm or bipolar w 15 electrodialysis while another part was formed by the words acid base and alkali similarly the keywords in web of science database were made up of bipolar membrane electrodialysis or bmed or edbm or bipolar near 15 electrodialysis and acid base alkali afterwards the number of articles searched via scopus and web of science were 358 and 382 respectively 2 2 screening and selection of article after searching the corresponding articles the two stage screening and selection of articles was conducted the preliminary selection was achieved by eliminating the identical literature retrieved from these two databases furthermore considering the orientation of resources utilization the broad inclusion criteria were mainly concentrated on the applications of bmed in acids and alkalis production consequently 167 papers focusing on acids and alkalis extraction were selected from the first stage of screening as shown in fig 1 the second stage of selecting articles was also based on the purpose of this review i e the high value resources recovery from salt containing solutions by bmed especially the mechanism technology operation and the economic analysis of bmed process should be covered therefore the detailed inclusion criteria were mainly focused on the following four points 1 including the mechanism of bmed 2 including the resources recovery from saline wastewater 3 discussing the influencing factors e g current density initial solution concentration configuration of membrane stack 4 cost evaluation of bmed processes finally 109 papers were selected to perform the literature review after two stage screening and selection 3 bmed for acid alkali production 3 1 mechanism of acid alkali production by bipolar membrane the most special feature of bmed is the introduction of bipolar membrane to the traditional electrodialysis bipolar membrane is composed of aem and cem with a catalytic medium in the intermediate layer at present there are only two solvents reported to be dissociated in bipolar membranes fig 2 water h2o into h and oh and methanol ch3oh into h and ch3o as shown in eqs 1 2 huang and xu 2006 especially the theoretical energy for water dissociation in the bipolar membrane is 79 9 kj mol which is significantly lower than that of the electrolysis process 198 5 kj mol jiang et al 2019 which indicates water dissociation by bmed is a greener process with lower consumption chabi et al 2017 1 h 2 o h o h 2 c h 3 oh c h 3 o h as depicted in fig 3 the salt solution named as mn with mm as cations and nn as anions passes through a salt chamber between the aem and cem arrangement and is ionized into mm and nn in a typical three chamber bmed system tongwen 2002 meanwhile water molecules diffuse through the ion exchange membranes of bpm into the catalytic layer accompanying with the water dissociation h cross the cem and combine with anions migrated from the salt chamber to form the corresponding acid in acid chamber pärnamäe et al 2021 similarly oh migrate into the alkali chamber with the cations from the salt chamber in the form of related alkali as a result the simultaneous generation of acids and alkalis from salt solutions is the main application of bmed pärnamäe et al 2021 especially the obtained products are generally more valuable compared with salts which will be further discussed in section 3 3 so bmed method was extensively utilized in saline wastewater treatment to increase the process benefits as shown in eqs 3 8 the conversion of salts such as nacl jiang et al 2021 libr gao et al 2021b na2so4 monat et al 2020 nah2po2 qiu et al 2019 li2b4o7 bunani et al 2017 to acids and alkalis by bmed has been reported by previous studies 3 n a o h naoh 4 c l h hcl 5 l i o h lioh 6 b r h hbr 7 h 2 po 2 h h 3 p o 2 8 b oh 4 h h 3 b o 3 h 2 o nevertheless the acid concentration was generally slightly lower than alkali concentration during simultaneous acid alkali production by bmed it could be ascribed to the higher mobility rate of h than that of oh ions resulting in higher leakage of h ions through anion exchange membranes monat et al 2020 qiu et al 2019 zhang et al 2017a furthermore the lower barrier capacity of aem for h ions than cem for oh ions was also reported as an important reason wang et al 2012 3 2 low grade waste salt to high value acid and alkali as illustrated in the last section bmed could treat saline wastewater and utilize the contained salts to generate usable acids and alkalis which has potential economic benefits by resource regeneration benefitting from this property the components handled by bmed process are abundant including inorganic and organic systems for convenience and straightforward explanation the applied bmed processes were classified according to their products into these four following categories 1 inorganic acid inorganic alkali 2 organic acid inorganic alkali 3 inorganic acid organic alkali 4 organic acid organic alkali 3 2 1 inorganic acid inorganic alkali hcl naoh generation bmed has been widely applied to treat inorganic saline wastewater to regenerate acids and alkalis one of the most widespread applications is the treatment of nacl predominant high salinity wastewater including ro brine du et al 2021 ibáñez et al 2013 wang et al 2014 yang et al 2014 pretreated leachates ilhan et al 2017 and textile wastewater liu et al 2015 although nacl in the wastewater is of low utilization benefits the economic performance could be enhanced by converting it into hcl and naoh resources as illustrated in table 1 ortiz et al investigated a technically alternative option for producing hcl and naoh solutions of more than 1 0 m with current efficiencies of approximately 60 90 by bmed ibáñez et al 2013 ibanez et al utilized ro brine as wastewater and increased the concentrations of the hcl and naoh products to 3 3 m and 3 6 m respectively herrero gonzalez et al 2020 nevertheless there were generally ions with higher valent such as ca2 and mg2 in nacl wastewater under this circumstance softening pretreatment was carried out by a combination of ed and monovalent cation exchange membranes followed by the preparation of acids and alkalis by bmed wang et al 2014 to further simplify this process and improve the performance selective electrodialysis sed was introduced into bmed which could be utilized to obtain highly pure naoh and hcl solutions from concentrated brine chen et al 2018 with the in depth study of the bmed mechanism new strategies have been proposed and validated for complex systems containing multivalent ions the proton leakage was used to avoid the deposition of divalent ions on the membrane surface during the treatment of ro brine with hardness ions after the bmed process 0 6 m naoh solution and 0 7 m hcl solution with relatively high purity were obtained song et al 2021 furthermore bmed has also been gradually applied to practical ro brine treatment brackish water from jinhai lake in tianjin china was treated in the bmed system with bem aem cem membrane stack configuration where 0 7 m hcl and 0 6 m naoh could be generated simultaneously du et al 2021 compared with the ro brine some textile printing and dyeing wastewater also contain high salinity and they are also potential raw materials for acids and alkalis by bmed as shown in table 1 textile printing and dyeing wastewater have also been converted through bmed to produce high value acid and alkali products chen et al 2020 ilhan et al 2017 shen et al 2014 for example simulated textile wastewater was treated by bmed system to extract resources during which 1 28 m naoh and 1 19 m hcl solutions were obtained at constant voltage mode berkessa et al 2019 lin et al 2015b h2so4 naoh generation except for the bmed processes to obtain hcl and naoh another acid alkali combination commonly produced via bmed are h2so4 and naoh the specific details were summarized in table 2 which were mainly sourced from saline textile wastewater berkessa et al 2019 lin et al 2019 concentrated na2so4 stream gao et al 2021a monat et al 2020 tian et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 and cold rolling wastewater jiang et al 2021 in general textile wastewater has a high salinity e g 5 0 wt na2so4 and it could be considered as a potential resource lin et al 2015a 2015c mccarty et al 2011 as depicted in table 2 zhang et al treated the textile wastewater with salt and organic contents by bmed and obtained 0 236 m h2so4 and 0 507 m naoh berkessa et al 2019 furthermore ye et al used highly saline textile wastewater after ultrafiltration to produce 0 29 m h2so4 and 0 4 m naoh lin et al 2019 during this process water migration was found to limit the final acid alkali concentrations as na and so4 2 migrated across the membranes in the form of hydrated ions moreover jiang et al used higher salinity cold rolling wastewater to obtain 2 35 m h2so4 and 2 03 m naoh by adjusting the volume ratios of the solution in each chamber further confirming the excellent inorganic acid and alkali production performance of bmed jiang et al 2021 in addition to product concentration energy consumption and purity are also the main indicators for assessing the economic performance of bmed process as seen in table 2 the lowest energy consumption in the treatment of sodium sulfate wastewater was 1 4 kwh kg na2so4 and the purity of both acid and alkali was as high as 98 gao et al 2021a especially the separation of univalent and divalent anions has also been achieved in bmed to increase the product purity of a complex system by assembling monovalent selective anion exchange membranes msaem into bmed stacks xu et al separated the mixed salts into naoh monoprotic acid hcl and diprotic acid h2so4 with relatively high purity realizing purification of mixed acids yan et al 2020a nevertheless there is trade off between product concentration and energy consumption to address this issue chaudhury et al proposed a two step intermittent bmed process to balance the trade off which could obtain 3 6 m naoh and reduce chemical costs by 50 monat et al 2020 other inorganic acids inorganic alkalis the complexity of chemical processes determines the diversity of the main salts in high salinity wastewater abundant studies on the preparation of inorganic acids and alkalis from different sources e g pure low value salt solutions high salinity wastewater after pre treatment have been reported as shown in table 3 specific liquid salts include nh4 2so4 nabr na2b4o7 nh4cl li2b4o7 5h2o nah2po2 lici nh4 2moo4 could be recycled to generate corresponding acids and alkalis such as h2so4 nh4oh naohhbr naohh3bo3 nh4ohhcl liohh3bo3 and naohh3po2 bunani et al 2017 gao et al 2021b li et al 2016 nagasawa et al 2011 yan et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 2008 among them wastewater containing ammonia chloride receives special attention since ammonia nitrogen pollution has become a serious environmental concern in many countries nevertheless nh3 h2o chamber generally has high resistance which inhibits the performance of bmed zhao et al 2022 to avoid this problem shi et al modified the membrane stack of the bmed from three chamber to two chamber which could obviously reduce energy consumption and obtain 1 47 m hcl and 1 31 m nh3 h2o li et al 2016 in addition to wastewater a wide range of inorganic salts are also available as the inexpensive sources to produce high value inorganic acids and alkalis currently sodium hypophosphite nah2po2 is a potentially cheap raw material to produce hypophosphorous acid h3po2 which is an important chemical product for electroless nickel plating qiu et al 2019 yan et al 2019 considering environmental protection and efficiency issues bmed has the potential to be an alternative method for producing h3po2 for example shen et al integrated bmed with ion exchange adsorption to remove the leakage of na ions and 4 15 m h3po2 and 4 32 m naoh were finally obtained qiu et al 2019 except for this system other salts containing lithium bromine ammonium or boron have also been successfully converted to the corresponding acids and alkalis li et al 2016 lv et al 2018 nagasawa et al 2011 wei et al 2011 zhang et al 2008 as illustrated in table 3 3 2 2 organic acid inorganic alkali other than inorganic salt systems organic salts widely present in high salinity wastewater which could also be treated by bmed moreover the conversion of organic salts using bmed has no special requirements for pumps and spacers since the generated acid has much weaker corrosivity wang et al 2020 the details about the production of organic acids and inorganic alkalis by bmed were summarized in table 4 among the various organic salts sodium formate nacooh is one of the most common salts as its precursor formic acid hcooh is widely used in industries such as textiles natural rubber and leathering ferrer et al 2006 for this circumstance rakib et al researched the extraction of hcooh from nacooh wastewater by bmed and obtained 7 5 m hcooh with energy consumption of 2 6 kwh kg ferrer et al 2006 furthermore xu et al evaluated the economic performance of recovering hcooh from wastewater containing neopentyl glycol npg and the result showed the cost was 1 304 kg hcooh wei et al 2021 similar with formate system the preparation of acetic acid ch3cooh and naoh from sodium acetate residues by bmed has been investigated with the energy consumption of 6 0 19 2 kwh kg for ch3cooh and 8 9 26 2 kwh kg for naoh xue et al 2018 compared with the generation of inorganic acid and alkali via bmed du et al 2021 qiu et al 2019 further research might be performed to reduce the energy consumption for the organic systems different with the small organic acid molecules mentioned above the recovery of macromolecular organics by bmed is a challenge considering their low migrate mobility across aem which might result in higher energy consumption to address this situation the performance especially the energy consumption of bmed could be optimized in two ways including 1 promoting the dissociation of weak acid so that high conductivity and high concentration gradient of the solution would accelerate diffusive transport of ions szczygiełda and prochaska 2017 2 avoiding the migration of ions with large hydration radius across aem by modulating membrane arrangements lei et al 2020 for the first case prochaska et al investigated the generation of alpha ketoglutaric acid akg from sodium alpha ketoglutarate via bmed szczygiełda and prochaska 2017 as shown in eqs 9 10 the dissociation of akg acid reached a maximum level with ph higher than 7 so that the dissociation could be promoted in the alkaline environment szczygiełda and prochaska 2017 for the second situation an example was analyzed via the gluconate ions glu system glu has large ion radius and is difficult to cross the aem resulting in unsatisfied current efficiency and conversion rate lei et al 2020 li et al studied the production of gluconic acid hglu from sodium gluconate naglu and adopted membrane stack into bpm cem to avoid the transmembrane of glu lei et al 2020 during this process the energy consumption could be reduced by half compared with bpm aem and bpm aem cem configurations lei et al 2020 however the bpm cem two chamber arrangement would lead to the mixing of the feed solution and product streams thus reducing the purity of the products except for the salts mentioned above bmed is also available for the regeneration of other large weight organics with significant environmental and economic advantages including niacin li et al 2015 methionine jiang et al 2016 fumaric acid prochaska and woźniak budych 2014 alpha ketoglutaric acid szczygiełda and prochaska 2017 2021 l lactic acid lameloise and lewandowski 2012 ma et al 2019 succinic acid szczygiełda et al 2017 and citric acid sun et al 2017 above all bmed would be a competitive candidate in the preparation and recovery of organic acids and inorganic alkalis to achieve high value conversion of saline wastewaters and cheap salts 9 h 2 akg hak g h k a 1 3 4 10 3 10 hak g ak g 2 h k a 2 2 1 10 5 3 2 3 inorganic acid organic alkali similar with the organic acid inorganic alkali generating processes bmed has also been applied to the preparation of inorganic acid and organic alkalis as shown in table 5 most of the organic alkalis prepared by bmed were derived from halogen salts due to the high solubility and ionization ability of such salts miao et al 2018 yao et al 2020 considering some of the halogen ions might permeate across the bpm into the alkali chamber so the purity of the organic alkalis might be reduced for example shen et al used bpm cem aem cem membrane stack to regenerate tetrapropyl ammonium hydroxide tpaoh and hbr from tetrapropyl ammonium bromine tpabr with 91 6 conversion ratio shen et al 2013a moreover this membrane stack configuration was also used by shen et al to extract choline hydroxide from choline chloride with higher purity 321 75 ppm cl in the 45 wt choline hydroxides aqueous solution and the energy consumption was calculated as 0 7444 kwh kg choline hydroxide yao et al 2020 furthermore xu et al obtained the methyl methoxyacetate from methyl chloroacetate by bmed through alcohol splitting as shown in eq 11 li et al 2011 11 clc h 2 cooc h 3 c h 3 o c h 3 oc h 2 cooc h 3 c l 3 2 4 organic acid organic alkali compared to the applications of bmed in the preparation of inorganic acids inorganic alkalis inorganic acids organic alkalis and organic acids inorganic alkalis there was less research in the simultaneous generation of organic acids and alkalis from saline wastewaters and cheap salts recently a study of shen et al reported the treatment of s 2 amino 1 butanol l tartaric solution by bmed to obtain chiral s 2 amino 1 butanol and l tartaric acid as shown in fig 4 a lv et al 2021 based on this the s 2 amino 1 butanol would react with l tartaric acid to generate s 2 amino 1 butanol l tartaric for subsequent bmed operation achieving the closed production loops in fig 4 b during this process chiral s 2 amino 1 butanol 1 04 m with purity of approximately 98 2 was obtained accompanying with a current efficiency of 54 05 and energy consumption of 1 88 kwh kg s 2 amino 1 butanol respectively lv et al 2021 over the summary of various acid and alkali production by bmed it s suggested more attention should be gave for complex high salinity wastewater furthermore scale up experiments would be recommended to explore industrial production 3 3 economic analysis compared to the enrichment of salt solutions from high salinity wastewater bmed directly converts salt resources into the corresponding valuable acids and alkalis which would significantly improve the economic benefits of resource utilization theoretically herein we outlined an economic analysis of bmed for the conversion of low grade salts into valuable acids and alkalis the prices of process chemicals total costs and treatment capacities were summarized and the results are shown in table 6 as shown in table 6 the total process cost for the recovery of acids and alkalis from salts via bmed mainly includes total energy cost and investment cost the energy cost mainly relates to the energy consumption of the actual bmed process and local electricity charge at present the price of industrial electricity in china is almost 0 08 0 1 kwh qiu et al 2019 wei et al 2021 yan et al 2018 under this situation the total energy cost is mostly dependent on the energy consumption parameters of the bmed process the energy cost column in table 6 displays that hcooh lioh and h3po2 have significantly higher energy costs than hcl and naoh which could be contributed to their lower solubility and hydrolysis properties qiu et al 2019 on the other hand the total investment cost consists of membrane stack cost and peripheral cost qiu et al 2019 it could be found that the corresponding investment costs varied considerably among different types of products which could be ascribed to their different membrane stack membrane type and especially treatment capacity with the increment of the treatment capacity the total investment cost could be significantly reduced and the prices variance between generated acids alkalis and original salts obviously exceeds the total energy cost much this result further implies the potential economic benefits of the bmed processes furthermore considering the potential applications of bmed in wastewater treatment plants there would be almost no raw material cost and even negative cost due to the disposal fees of saline wastewater so the economic profits of the bmed would further increase under this condition to further clarify the process economy an industry scale process from table 6 for extracting h3po2 and naoh from nah2po2 was analyzed the recovery of h3po2 from nah2po2 displays outstanding economic benefits as the sum of the h3po2 price 12 142 86 t and naoh price 179 71 t is significantly larger than the sum of nah2po2 5000 t and total process cost 0 937 kg h3po2 qiu et al 2019 furthermore compared with the traditional ed the oxidization of h3po2 could be avoided in bmed process to ensure the purity qiu et al 2019 above all by comparing the prices of salts and acids bases as well as the total process cost of bmed process it could be found that the utilization of bmed for saline wastewater treatment has significant economic advantages 4 in situ utilization of acid and alkali considering the excellent acid and alkali producing performance environmental effects and economic benefits bmed has been in situ integrated with chemical processes that have special requirements for acids and alkalis moreover in situ utilization will reduce transport costs and enable deeper utilization of the bmed products according to the utilization form it could be divided into the in situ utilization of acid and in situ utilization of alkali generated by bmed 4 1 in situ utilization of acid generated by bmed in situ applications of acid produced by bmed are relatively rare and mainly utilized to extract co2 from seawater as shown in eq 12 for example iizuka et al realized the collection of co2 from carbonate solution via the acid produced by bmed and the regeneration of naoh at the same time iizuka et al 2012 nagasawa et al 2009 moreover xu et al used acid generated by bmed to simultaneously prepare methionine and achieve co2 extraction from methionine salts jiang et al 2017 similar with the extraction process of co2 the electro acidification process has also been used in the acidification purification of soybean protein ali et al 2010 mondor et al used the produced acid by bmed to improve the extraction of soy protein when the ph was reduced from 9 to 4 5 ali et al 2010 12 co 3 2 2 h hco 3 h c o 2 h 2 o the acid solutions produced by bmed was also in situ integrated with other electrochemical processes to obtain coupled electrochemical systems for example xiang et al adopted bmed coupled with a co2 reduction cell to extract and convert co2 from seawater by the generated acid and the schematic illustration is shown in fig 5 a digdaya et al 2020 during this process the co2 capture efficiency was 71 when the current density and seawater flow rate were 3 3 ma cm2 and 37 ml min respectively as depicted in the fig 5 b digdaya et al 2020 4 2 in situ utilization of alkali generated by bmed different from the applications of acid some studies have investigated the in situ applications of alkali from bmed since the generated alkalis are more versatile and convenient to be integrated chen et al 2021b zhao et al 2020b among them the in situ utilization of alkaline streams of bmed for the absorption of acidic gases is widely used especially coupled with carbon capture utilization and storage ccus which is considered as a highly potential technique for carbon neutrality chen et al 2022b tapia et al 2018 zhao et al proposed a membrane arrangement with novel bpm aem aem structure which could in situ utilize the generated alkalis to fix co2 and further mineralize it into functional caco3 zhao et al 2020b as shown in fig 6 a co2 gas was fluxed into the solution of the alkali chamber eqs 13 14 and hco3 and co3 2 ions were obtained eqs 15 16 then these anions would migrate across aem into the salt chamber under the electric field and be precipitated as functional caco3 eq 17 zhao et al 2020b on this foundation co2 was also reported to be captured by the generated alkali via bmed in the form of nesquehonite materials eq 18 chen et al 2022b under the optimum condition the carbon absorption ratio and the magnesium extraction ratio reached 50 85 and 56 71 respectively chen et al 2022b 13 c o 2 g c o 2 aq 14 c o 2 aq h 2 o h 2 c o 3 15 h 2 c o 3 o h hco 3 h 2 o 16 hco 3 o h h 2 o co 3 2 17 c a 2 co 3 2 cac o 3 s 18 m g 2 co 3 2 3 h 2 o mgc o 3 3 h 2 o s similar with the utilization of alkaline solutions for co2 absorption the alkaline streams of bmed have also been applied to the desulphurization of simulated flue gases displaying the versatile in situ applications of alkaline products for acid gas absorption zhao et al 2020c in general bmed could achieve in situ utilization of produced alkali solution by capturing acid gases especially co2 which could be further mineralized in the form of high value added carbonate products nevertheless the energy consumption of caco3 6 46 kwh kg is higher compared to that of naoh generation 1 81 kwh kg to enhance the economic performance zhao et al proposed self crystallization strategy to reduce the energy consumption through the investigation of ion migration rate in fig 6 b chen et al 2021b as illustrated in fig 6 c the energy consumption for treating seawater was reduced by 70 29 from 4 78 to 1 42 kwh t chen et al 2021b as a result it should be mentioned that more attention should be paid to process energy consumption control and membrane fouling prevention in addition to the absorption of acidic gases alkali generated by bmed could also be in situ used for the production of inorganic polymer coagulants zhang et al 2017b dehydrohalogenation reactions and ionic liquid recovery milewski et al 2019 zhang et al used the alkali produced by bpm aem configuration to prepare high alkalinity polymerized ferric sulphate pfs with the basicity attains of 14 72 zhang et al 2017b furthermore andrzej et al developed a method for the synthesis of glycidol from 3 chloro 1 2 propanediol by dehydrohalogenation with in situ production of oh ions by the bpm milewski et al 2019 apart from that the alkali generated by bmed could be used to regenerate the desulphurizing agents as well as the ionic liquids huang et al 2007 liang et al 2020 as illustrated in fig 7 triethylammonium hydrogen sulfate tea hso4 was dissociated in the alkali chamber into tea and hso4 benefiting from the migration of hso4 into the acid chamber the tea and so4 2 could be recovered with ratios of 93 7 and 96 4 during this process respectively liang et al 2020 5 influencing factors during the generation of acids and alkalis by bmed and their deep in situ applications as described above different operating conditions would have significant impacts on the whole process especially the performance and energy consumption these factors mainly include current density initial solution concentration configuration of membrane stack temperature initial volume ratio and electrode solution herein the critical analysis and comparison of these influencing factors were summarized in table 7 5 1 current density constant current operation has been commonly used in bmed processes where the current density is determined by the current applied at both ends of the membrane stack and the effective area of the applied membranes based on the previous studies the influences of current density on bmed could be summarized into four aspects 1 water dissociation 2 ion migration rate 3 operating time and 4 energy consumption according to the second wien effect the water dissociation of the catalytic layer in the bipolar membrane is mainly determined by the strength of the applied electric field pärnamäe et al 2021 besides the water dissociation would increase at high electric fields due to more water being dissociated in the bipolar membrane jiang et al 2014 wei et al 2011 based on these deduction zhao et al investigated the relationship between oh generation rate and current density which exhibited a positive correlation as shown in fig 8 a chen et al 2021b other than water dissociation another important effect originated from the current density is the ion migration rate briefly speaking the increased current density would promote ion migration rate and thus more ions could be transmitted across the membrane wei et al 2022 du et al and ortiz et al concluded that an increase in current density would accelerate the rate of ion migration thereby increased the yield of hcl and naoh at the same operating time du et al 2021 mier et al 2008 the phenomenon above could be further verified by the fact that the concentration of both acid and alkali increased with the current density at the same moment as shown in fig 8b sun et al 2022 on the other hand the increment of current density would promote the migration rate so that it would also contribute to the reduction of operating time at certain saline concentrations for example li et al observed the operation time was reduced from 120 min to 60 min after the current density was increased from 38 to 54 ma cm2 during the extraction of hcl and nh3 h2o from nh4cl by bmed li et al 2016 furthermore shen et al found that higher current densities resulted in lower voltage drops during bmed operation which is an essential factor to the impact of current density shen et al 2013b likewise sun et al found the operation time was reduced by half when the current density was increased from 30 to 70 ma cm2 in treating the high salinity sulfanilic acid wastewater as shown in fig 8c sun et al 2022 nevertheless the elevation of current density would also increase the energy consumption so the reasonable assessment of energy consumption is essential energy consumption represents economic performance as an important indicator of bmed process which has a strong relationship with current density lu et al 2020 yan et al 2020b as illustrated in fig 8 d the energy consumption of both acid and alkali production increased as the rising of current density generally the increment of current density induces enlarged energy consumption owing to a large proportion of total electrical energy being converted into joule heat eisaman et al 2012 similar results on the relationship of energy consumption and current density have been reported by gao et al 2021b liu et al 2020 wei et al 2022 yan et al 2019 on the other hand as another essential energy parameter for bmed current efficiency is actually determined by the combination of the current density and concentrations of the acid and alkali which could be understood as the actual consumption of electrons for the products as observed in fig 8 d the current efficiency decreased with the increment of current density wu et al demonstrated that the current efficiency decreased from 94 1 to 76 2 with the current density was increased from 30 to 70 ma cm2 for the generation of ch3cooh and naoh xue et al 2018 similarly gao et al also found a decrease in current efficiency from 91 61 at 10 ma cm2 to 83 02 at 50 ma cm2 for the production of hbr and lioh gao et al 2021b 5 2 initial solution concentration during bmed operations the initial concentrations of the salt acid alkali chamber solutions play an important role on the final acid alkali concentrations and energy consumption the corresponding influence could be summarized into two categories 1 the influence of initial salt concentration 2 the effect of initial concentrations in acid and alkali chambers 5 2 1 influence of initial salt concentration there are mainly three aspects of the influence of initial salt solution concentration during bmed process including the final concentrations of acid alkali products the solution volume of each chamber and energy consumption among that the influence on final concentrations of acid alkali products is the most significant for example chen et al investigated the generation of lioh and h2so4 from li2so4 and found with the initial li2so4 solution elevated from 0 5 m to 1 5 m the concentrations of acid alkali would increase from 0 49 m and 0 94 m to 1 23 m and 2 16 m respectively chen et al 2021c furthermore monat et al explored the generation of naoh and h2so4 from na2so4 and the concentrations of both acid and alkali increased as the rising of initial salt concentration 0 7 2 m monat et al 2020 the similar results were also reported in the system to produce h3po2 and naoh from nah2po2 during bmed qiu et al 2019 yan et al 2019 in general an appropriate increase of the initial salt concentration is beneficial for obtaining higher concentrations of acid and alkali solutions nevertheless with the further elevation of the initial concentration the products concentration cannot be continuously increased since the restriction of the membrane process during the bmed process of hno3 and naoh from nano3 raissouni et al found that the concentrations of hno3 and naoh reached a plateau when the concentration of nano3 continued to rise from 1 2 m to 3 m raissouni et al 2007 this phenomenon could be attributed to two main reasons 1 leakage of h and oh through anion and cation exchange membranes and 2 the migration of water through aem and cem into acid and alkali chambers raissouni et al 2007 moreover the water migration during bmed process would also result in the change of solution volume which was caused by electroosmosis driven water migration and concentration diffusion jiang et al 2015 the water migration during bmed could mainly be described as the ion migration in form of hydrated ions inducing the increment of acid and alkali volumes tanaka 2004 therefore higher concentration differences between the salt and alkali chambers would improve the driving force for the migration of water molecules thus the significant change of solution volume ye et al 2015 according to a study on the extraction of lioh and hcl from brine the volume of acid alkali solutions has a positive linear trend with the salt chamber concentration fig 9 a zhao et al 2020a for the economical parameters the increment of initial salt solution could reduce the energy consumption by increasing the concentration of products for example gao et al researched the energy consumption of libr during bmed process it decreased when the concentration of libr increased from 0 1 m to 0 5 m gao et al 2021b furthermore li et al also found the higher initial concentration of nh4cl was favored to reduce the unit energy consumption of hcl and nh3 h2o produced by bmed li et al 2016 5 2 2 influence of initial acid alkali concentrations the initial acid alkali solution concentrations also have influence on the final concentrations of acid alkali products the solution volume of each chamber current efficiency acid and alkali conversion ratios and desalination rate during bmed process the initial acid alkali solution concentrations have similar impacts with the initial salt concentration on the solution volume of each chamber and current efficiency for example song et al found that naoh with higher concentrations more than 2 m could be generated from brine when the initial alkali concentration increased from 0 to 2 m and the volume variations of alkali chamber solution increased from 4 to 22 as the rising of initial naoh concentrations song et al 2021 on the other hand raissouni et al demonstrated that current efficiency decreased from 85 to 54 for naoh and from 78 to 38 for hno3 when the initial acid and alkali concentration increased from 1 to 3 m raissouni et al 2007 similarly as shown in fig 9 b for the system recovering hcl and naoh from saline wastewater by bmed the current efficiency decreased slightly with increasing initial acid alkali concentrations sun et al 2022 in addition to the factors above öner et al found that the increment of initial acid alkali solution concentrations would decrease the desalination rate and acid alkali conversion ratios when extracted nh3 h2o and hcl from nh4cl öner et al 2021 this phenomenon could be attributed that high initial acid and alkali concentrations led to increase potential differences for back diffusion of the ions 5 3 configuration of membrane stack bmed is typically performed in two chamber guo et al 2021 lv et al 2018 nagasawa et al 2011 wei et al 2013 and three chamber configurations gao et al 2021a li et al 2011 monat et al 2020 qiu et al 2019 zhao et al 2021 to optimize the extraction and utilization of resources membrane stack configurations with multiple compartments have also been proposed with the progressive development of bmed technology shen et al 2013a the reported membrane stack arrangement of bmed have been summarized in fig 10 as shown in fig 10 a and fig 10 b two chamber membrane stack configurations bpm cem and bpm aem are generally used for acid alkali production and utilization lameloise and lewandowski 2012 li et al 2016 szczygiełda and prochaska 2017 wei et al 2013 guo et al used a bpm cem membrane stack to recovery ammonia and obtain high purity nh4 2so4 from low grade sulfuric acid guo et al 2021 similarly bpm aem membrane stack configuration system was applied to obtain h3bo3 and naoh from the aqueous solution and more than 90 of the boron was removed in this system nagasawa et al 2011 in addition to the preparation of inorganic acids and alkalis two chamber bmed offers unique advantages for the preparation of weak acids or alkalis it is generally considered that two chamber configuration is the best cell structure for the conversion of organic salts into the corresponding acids by bmed wang et al 2011 2010 because the salt solution could be mixed with organic acid solution in one chamber to increase conductivity and reduce energy consumption furthermore it also avoids transmembrane migration of macromolecules which would inhibit the potential membrane pollution lei et al 2020 zheng et al 2022 for example a variety of organic acids including l lactic acid methionine and niacin were prepared by bpm cem configuration as depicted in section 3 2 2 jiang et al 2016 li et al 2015 ma et al 2019 however two chamber configuration would reduce the purity of bmed products due to the existence of mixed chamber to address this situation another ion exchange membrane was introduced into the two chamber system to mitigate leakage of impurity ions and thus the three chamber stack was fabricated compared with two chamber stack three chamber bmed system fig 10c and fig 10d generates or recovers two product streams acid and alkali with high purity having been extensively utilized in resource conversion of multiple salt solutions including nacl du et al 2021 ibáñez et al 2013 na2so4 monat et al 2020 nh4 2so4 zhang et al 2008 nah2po2 qiu et al 2019 yan et al 2019 and ch3coona bunani et al 2017 based on the traditional two chamber electrodialysis bpm aem bpm cem and three chamber electrodialysis bpm aem cem bpm cem aem aem bpm cem ferrer et al 2006 gutiérrez et al 2013 xue et al 2018 new membrane stack structures such as bpm aem aem fig 10e have also been proposed to in situ integrate co2 capture by bmed chen et al 2022b zhao et al 2020b for those systems containing mono valent and bi valent ions a four chamber electrodialysis system was proposed by introducing monovalent selective membrane which promoted the selective recovery of resources from high salinity wastewater as depicted in fig 10 f xu et al adopted the four chamber stack and thus the cl so4 2 could be simultaneously separated and converted into high purity hcl and h2so4 by introducing a msaem into the bpm aem cem stack yan et al 2020a in practical bmed applications the complexity of the system often requires the comparison of multiple membrane stack configurations to determine the optimum configuration therefore we compared and summarized the effects of two chamber and three chamber membrane stack configurations on the acid alkali preparation and their applications in general two chamber stack would reduce the energy consumption of membrane stack for weak electrolytes compared to three chamber configuration for example li et al treated simulated nh4cl wastewater and compared the effect of bpm aem cem and bpm aem stack configuration on the production of hcl and nh3 h2o li et al 2016 during this process the two chamber system was found having faster conductivity drop and higher hcl concentration than the three chamber system resulting in higher current efficiency and lower energy consumption li et al 2016 similarly lei et al compared the effects of bpm cem bpm aem and bpm aem cem on the production of hglu and naoh from naglu lei et al 2020 it has been found that bpm cem had the best overall performance with the highest conversion and the lowest energy consumption 0 104 kg hglu in this process lei et al 2020 on the other hand three chamber stack configuration is generally used in the strong electrolyte systems du et al 2021 gao et al 2021a 2021b moreover the separate two product streams from the salt solutions improve the purity with lower resistance of the membrane stack due to the higher dissociation for instance wang et al used a bpm aem cem membrane stack configuration for the generation of l 10 camphorsulfonic acid l csa since l csa is a strong electrolyte with high dissociation constant yan et al 2022 5 4 temperature temperature would affect bmed system through two effects 1 the dissociation of water in the bipolar membrane into h and oh 2 the rate of ion migration across the membranes for the water dissociation it has been pointed that the kinetics of water dissociation in bpm would be enhanced with elevated temperature alcaraz et al 2001 ramírez et al 1992 however the thermal stability limits high temperature process as commercial bpm cannot withstand temperatures above 40 60 c for long duration pärnamäe et al 2021 sharifian et al 2021 therefore the study on the high temperature performance of bpm is scarce for the trans membrane process the increase of temperature 35 c to 55 c led to an increase in ion migration and thus higher conductivity in the acid and alkali chambers which would improve process current efficiency and reduce energy consumption haddad et al 2016 zhao et al found that the increment of temperature from 20 c to 30 c promoted the transmembrane migration rate of co3 2 ions and reduced the energy consumption when co2 was in situ captured by bmed chen et al 2021b 5 5 initial volume ratio the modulation of initial solution volume ratio is an effective way to obtain product with higher concentration lu et al 2020 in this section the discussion would be categorized into changing the volume ratios of two chambers or three chambers of bmed for the first case yan et al explored the influence of different volume ratios between acid and alkali chambers on the product concentrations it was found that the final hcl concentration increased from 1 95 m to 2 71 m when the ratios decreased from 1 00 to 0 50 lv et al 2018 similarly li et al found that rising ratios of salt to acid chamber or salt to alkali chamber could not only increase the concentration of hcl 29 2 to 48 18 g l and nh3 h2o 26 25 to 43 05 g l but reduce current efficiency and energy consumption li et al 2016 this phenomenon could be ascribed to that the larger volume ratios between salt and product chambers resulted in lower resistance of membrane stack liu et al 2022 the principle of changing the volume ratio of the three chambers is essentially the same as the two chambers condition for instance song et al indicated that when the volume ratios of salt acid and alkali were 5 5 3 5 5 2 and 10 5 2 respectively the concentrations of naoh were 1 2 1 6 and 2 4 m respectively song et al 2021 this suggested that the increment of salt chamber volume ratio and reduction of alkali chamber volume ratio would produce naoh solution with higher concentration song et al 2021 5 6 electrode solution the type of anode or cathode solution electrode solution also has an impact on product purity and energy consumption during bmed processes the choice of electrolyte solutions for the bmed process is based on three main reasons 1 excellent conductivity 2 absence of impurities 3 avoiding membrane fouling or pollution in general nacl dursun et al 2021 na2so4 lv et al 2021 xue et al 2018 yan et al 2019 nano3 chen et al 2022b 2021b are the most commomly used during bmed processes among that it is worth noting that for these systems containing hardness ions such as ca ⅱ and mg ⅱ nano3 was generally chosen as the electrode solution to avoid precipitation chen et al 2022b kravtsov et al 2020 merkel et al 2018 zhao et al 2020c kanca et al first reported the effects of electrolytes concentration on acid and alkali production the conversion rate and the purity for the regeneration of hcl and naoh from binary salt water dursun et al 2021 during this study it was found that higher concentrations of electrolytes resulted in higher product purity and lower energy consumption dursun et al 2021 6 strategies for improving bmed performance 6 1 energy consumption reduction energy consumption is an important indicator for bmed which represents the economic performance of the whole process in particular considering the low hydrolysis degree in weak electrolytes bmed systems these systems generally suffer from higher energy consumption compared with strong electrolytes therefore the improvement of process efficiency and reduction of energy consumption is essential for weak electrolytes bmed systems in the production of weak electrolytes higher energy is consumed due to the poorer conductivity and thus larger resistance of membrane stack for this situation liu at al added the resins to form conductive chains and accelerate ion transportation and it could be considered as an effective method for improving the electrical conductivity of the solution liu et al 2015 furthermore zhang et al studied the effect of adding resins into the chambers and found that the energy consumption decreased from 5 6 kwh kg to 0 6 kwh kg for recovery of acetic acid from simulated acetaldehyde wastewater zhang et al 2011 similarly wu et al reduced the energy consumption from 11 48 to 8 75 kwh kg for ch3cooh and 20 66 to 14 14 kwh kg for naoh by adding strong alkali resins when utilization of ch3coona waste residue xue et al 2015 other than adding resins in situ method by introducing self crystallization during bmed was proposed by zhao et al which decreased almost 76 energy consumption chen et al 2021b 6 2 multi stage operational strategy for the recovery of resources in complex systems through bmed two stage bmed has been proposed to recycle resources step by step two stage bmed is a process that produces separate types of acid or alkali to improve the concentration and purity of the product in a complex system shi et al 2018 for the example in fig 11 a shi et al proposed a novel two stage operational strategy to separate po4 3 volatile fatty acids vfas from cl so4 2 by bmed shi et al 2018 it should be noted that after the voltage started to increase significantly at the inflection point the depletion of strong acidic ions both the alkali and acid chamber solutions were replaced with deionized water shi et al 2018 as illustrated in fig 11 b and fig 11 c two solutions of different compositions and concentrations of alkali alkali i alkali ii and acid acid i and acid ii were produced and the recovery yield of nh4 increased from 52 to 78 shi et al 2018 moreover a multi stage batch bmed process was designed and a maximum concentration of 3 40 m was obtained in the second stage of bmed process hussain et al 2021 therefore multi stage operational strategy could be considered for applications such as the enhancement of product concentrations and the stepwise utilization of ions in bmed systems 6 3 model optimization for bmed although bmed has been extensively researched further research is still needed to predict its functionality to optimize the system and eventually scale it up to an industrial level szczygiełda and prochaska 2017 in this section the modeling of bmed could be categorized as leakage of current efficiency and comprehensive process 6 3 1 leakage of current efficiency current could bypass the effective area of the membranes in bmed due to the potential difference between adjacent compartments resulting in a loss of current efficiency peng and sun 2020 peng et al developed mathematical model by using the current balance equation and the potential balance equation through multisim software for predicting the leakage current peng et al 2022 by using this model the performance of bmed could be improved by optimizing the spacer layers between the membrane stacks peng et al 2022 6 3 2 comprehensive process recently model optimization for bmed about the comprehensive process has also been developed culcasi et al proposed a comprehensive process model based on a multi scale approach with distributed parameters by the process simulator gproms model builder culcasi et al 2022 based on the process for the extraction of hcl and naoh solutions by bmed it has been simulated with a balanced cost of approximately 280 t naoh which demonstrated the enormous potential of industrialization culcasi et al 2022 furthermore lin et al developed a systematic framework based on performance trade off between energy efficiency and process kinetic rates of bmed processes lu et al 2020 7 future applications and prospects based on the summary above the future applications and prospects of bmed were considered including 1 at present large number of bmed applications were reported as batch operation and there was little investigation on continuous operation due to the complexity of the wastewater matrix pärnamäe et al 2021 this might limit the application of bmed and slow down its large scale industrialization inspired by the statements above the continuous bmed processes for different saline wastewater systems are needed to be further developed to facilitate the industrialization of bmed furthermore bmed also has the potential to be integrated with other processes such as electrodialysis metathesis to obtain acid and alkali in the practical industrial applications zhu et al 2022 therefore the research on the continuous bmed based integrated industrial processes is also important 2 during the long period of bmed operation it could be observed that the acid or alkali concentrations decreased as the proceeding of bmed zhao et al 2021 the reasons for the decrement of product concentration and process performance could be ascribed to the limitations of the ion leakage and water migration fernandez gonzalez et al 2016 however the principles for inhibiting ion leakage and water migration haven t been well explored on one hand ion leakage is mainly caused by co ion leakage and the most significant one is proton leakage in the bmed processes pärnamäe et al 2021 qiu et al 2021 zhang et al 2017b to avoid the drop of process performance caused by proton leakage it s suggested to investigate the mechanism and its influence on bmed processes on the other hand water migration originating from the transportation of hydrated ions would also lead to the decrement of product concentrations therefore the relations between hydration number and ions migration during water migration in bmed should appeal more attention 3 the in situ applications of acid and alkali generated by bmed were less reported and the published work were mainly focused on the extraction and capture of acid gases chen et al 2022b zhao et al 2020b considering the extensive requirements of acids and alkalis in chemical industry it is necessary to carry out further research on the in situ acid base integrated application of bmed especially it was observed during in situ applications that the energy consumption of bmed is relatively high chen et al 2022b 2021b noting that a significant part of the bmed cost originate from electricity consumption with the widespread use of clean energy including hydropower and wind power its applications in bmed processes would significantly improve the process economical parameters and enhance the development of bmed based in situ applications 8 conclusion in this review bmed was systematically discussed for high value conversion of saline wastewater based on environmental and economic benefits firstly the applications of bmed to produce acids and alkalis were detailed concluded according to the products intrinsic properties including inorganic acid inorganic alkali organic acid inorganic alkali inorganic acid organic alkali and organic acid organic alkali in addition the economic analysis of bmed processes for extracting acids and alkalis was outlined furthermore the deep in situ utilization of acid alkali generated by bmed were summarized the influence of the operating parameters on the performance of bmed were also reviewed including current density initial solution

summarized finally considering the current development and application of bmed future applications and prospects for its applications in the saline wastewater resource utilization were presented

15331,membrane based technology has been confirmed as an effective way to treat emulsified oily wastewater however membrane fouling is still one of practical challenges in long term operation herein a novel passive active combined strategy was proposed to control membrane fouling in continuous oily wastewater purification where the δ mno2 decoration layer helped to reduce the total fouling ratio passive strategy for fouling mitigation and the catalytic cleaning effectively removed the irreversible oil fouling active strategy for fouling removal the functional membrane was prepared via in situ modification referred to as δ mno2 ta pes the morphology crystalline phase chemical structure and surface properties of the membranes were systematically characterized compared with pes the δ mno2 ta pes possessed superhydrophilicity enhanced electronegativity and narrowed pore size the δ mno2 ta pes achieved high water permeation flux of 723 9 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 excellent oil rejection with separation efficiency above 98 5 for various emulsions and durable anti oil fouling performance with frrb of 98 0 notably the oil cake layer fouling on δ mno2 ta pes was greatly alleviated owing to its enhanced surface properties in addition δ mno2 ta pes showed high cleaning efficiency in the peroxymonosulfate pms cleaning process where the radical and nonradical pathways occurred simultaneously and the active substances generated in the nonradical process especially 1o2 were considered as the main contributor to the reduction of irreversible fouling overall the novel strategy of fouling control ensured the efficient operation of ultrafiltration membranes for the continuous oily wastewater purification graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords oily wastewater ultrafiltration membrane fouling control superhydrophilic surface catalytic cleaning data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the oily water treatment is crucial since the surging oily wastewater discharged from industrial production daily life and frequent marine oil spill accidents threatens the ecosystem and human health shannon et al 2008 conventional methods including skimmers centrifugation air flotation coagulation flocculation have been employed to purify oily wastewater shi et al 2022 zhu et al 2016 nevertheless these traditional approaches are inapplicable to finely emulsified wastewater chen et al 2022 membrane technology stands out with acknowledged as an efficient technology to solve this challenge not only owing to its facile operation low cost and negligible environmental impact but also its high separation accuracy via a size sieving mechanism kota et al 2012 werber et al 2016 yang et al 2012 however the membrane fouling still remains the achilles heel which restricts its practical application on a large scale in oily wastewater purification nayak et al 2021 yang et al 2018 as a typical type of spreadable foulants oil droplets tend to adhere to the polymeric membrane block pores and then form a continuous oil film on membrane surface resulting in severe fouling during emulsions filtration process therefore effective fouling control strategies are of great importance for continuous oily wastewater purification hydrophilic modification as the important content of the passive antifouling strategies has shown high efficiency in fouling control of spreadable oil zhang et al 2016 through hydrophilic modification the hydrophobic interactions between oil droplets and membrane surface are weakened and the adsorption or settlement of oil to membrane is greatly reduced gao et al 2018 basically the single strategy established only by hydrophilic modification is not efficient enough for fouling control in long term operation since no hydrophilic modified membranes can guarantee the complete rejection of oil once small sized oil droplets come into membrane pores oil adhesion and pore blockages take place with leading to the membrane fouling the reversible fouling is easy to be removed by physical cleaning whereas it is difficult to cope with irreversible fouling kimura et al 2004 porcelli and judd 2010 wang et al 2014 inspired by the active strategies against biofouling qi et al 2018 wang et al 2019b destruction of oil droplets tightly adhered to membrane or trapped in pores is of great significance for fouling control in oily wastewater treatment the catalytic cleaning method has been confirmed to be an effective method to remove the membrane fouling he et al 2019 li et al 2022 zhao et al 2022 sulfate radical based advanced oxidation process sr aop is gaining popularity in fouling removal as sulfate radicals have the advantages of higher activity over a wide ph range and longer half life liu et al 2022 peroxymonosulfate pms as a stable and eco friendly solid with excellent water solubility could be activated to generate sulfate radicals via various methods including heat uv transition metal ions and carbon materials wang et al 2018 the free radicals produced during advanced oxidation process help degrade organic contaminants and perform efficient physicochemical cleaning ma et al 2021 based on the above consideration a passive active combined strategy shows great potential in realization of continuous emulsion separation distinguished from most polymers some inorganic materials possess inherent outstanding robustness hydrophilicity and catalytic characteristic which favor to construct the organic inorganic hybrid membranes with superhydrophilicity and high catalytic cleaning effectiveness ma et al 2022 wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 among them manganese dioxide mno2 emerges with excellent catalytic performances and shows enormous application prospects in the oily wastewater treatment owing to the unique properties of easy synthesis low cost and good environmental compatibility chen et al 2010 kim et al 2013 yang et al 2021 to date mno2 based catalysts applied in wastewater treatment consist of different crystal phases including α mno2 β mno2 δ mno2 and γ mno2 which exhibit multiple morphologies in different dimensions li et al 2016 especially the layered δ mno2 aroused the great interest of researchers and the nanosheet possesses itself with a high specific surface area which is helpful to take full advantage of active sites rong and liu 2019 in boyom tatchemo et al s work boyom tatchemo et al 2020 different kinds of the δ mno2 catalysts were successfully plasma synthesized and the catalysts were active enough to activate dissolved o2 which contributed to the high removal efficiency of tartrazin yellow however how to build bridges between membranes and mno2 remains a challenge blending is a common method munnawar et al 2017 safarpour et al 2016 and it tends to cause the aggregation of mno2 nanoparticles with worsening the compatibility between fillers and polymer networks moreover a large number of mno2 nanoparticles cannot be fully used and the improvement in membrane performance is limited thus hindering the application by contrast in situ strategy should be a reliable way to achieve a hybrid membrane with uniform distribution of inorganic materials li et al 2021 2017 herein a passive active combined strategy was proposed to control fouling in the continuous oily wastewater treatment tannic acid ta was employed to realize the in situ growth of δ mno2 layer from membrane surface the strong coordination bonds between the catechol of ta and mn2 provided abundant nucleation sites for further mineralization the 3d coral reef like micro nanostructures endowed the commercial membrane with superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity showing remarkable anti oil fouling performance in addition the catalytic δ mno2 greatly enhanced the pms cleaning efficiency due to the removal of oil foulants via reactive radicals and nonradical pathways our work provides a new insight into the fouling control strategy for oily wastewater purification 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials polyethersulfone pes ultrafiltration 150 kda membrane utilized as the substrate for in

characterization of the membranes the surface morphologies of the pes ta mn pes mnox ta pes and δ mno2 ta pes membranes were visualized by sem with different magnification times as shown in fig 1 a the surface of the unmodified pes membrane was smooth and the submicron sized pores were evenly distributed on it the morphology fig 1b following ta mn coating was largely unchanged due to the uniform deposition of ta mn complex interestingly the smooth surface changed into ridge like nanostructures after 60 c incubation treatment mnox ta pes fig 1c the increase of temperature accelerated the hydrolysis and oswald ripening of manganese ions resulting in the deposition of amorphous manganese oxides on the surface of ta mn membranes tsai et al 2015 with microcrystalline mno2 growing along the ridge like structures 3d coral reef like δ mno2 morphology was formed on the surface of δ mno2 ta pes fig 1d in terms of surface roughness the average roughness ra of the pes ta mn pes mnox ta pes and δ mno2 ta pes membranes was 5 7 4 0 25 1 and 92 3 nm respectively fig s2 the decreased ra of ta mn pes might be ascribed to the deposition of ta mn complex while the manganese oxides growing from mnox ta pes and δ mno2 ta pes membrane surface dramatically increased membrane roughness surface roughness changes influenced wettability according to wenzel and cassie protocols yang et al 2020 indicated the best hydrophilicity of the δ mno2 ta pes membrane the afm analysis well matched with the sem and other data reported in other literatures xie et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 besides the eds signal of mn was mainly concentrated on the membrane surface whereas the s element was distributed throughout the cross section indicating the coverage of δ mno2 on pes surface fig 1e the crystalline phase of nanosheets grown from membrane surface was characterized by xrd there was no obvious diffraction peak in xrd spectrum of ta mn pes and mnox ta pes fig s3 by contrast as depicted in fig 2 a the xrd pattern of δ mno2 ta showed four diffraction peaks at 13 0 24 2 36 7 and 65 9 which were well assigned to the 001 002 100 and 110 planes of δ mno2 pdf 80 1098 d wang et al 2019 furthermore the microstructure of δ mno2 nanosheets was presented in the hrtem image fig 2b and the lattice fringe with a spacing of 0 69 nm can be clearly observed which corresponds to the 001 planes of δ mno2 zheng et al 2021 the surface chemical compositions of the pes ta mn pes mnox ta pes and δ mno2 ta pes membranes were further investigated by xps and ftir fig s4 as shown in fig 2c the peaks of o 1 s n 1 s c 1 s s 2 s and s 2p were observed from the xps survey spectrum of pes consistent with other reports xia et al 2022 in comparison the percentage of mn and o elements of δ mno2 ta pes was increased to 14 9 and 40 6 table s1 respectively and the peaks of s 2 s and 2p disappeared according to the further xps analysis fig 2d and fig s5 two characteristic peaks assigned to mn4 654 7 and 643 8 ev and mn3 653 7 and 642 0 ev can be clearly observed from the δ mno2 ta pes surface with an energy gap of 11 8 ev lei et al 2020 the binding energy of o 1 s could be divided into different interactions of mn o mn mn oh c o c o o and h o h ko et al 2019 respectively this result suggested the complete oxidation of ta mn complexes to form δ mno2 the results verified the feasibility of the modification method with realizing the successful in situ growth of δ mno2 from commercial membrane surfaces via ta as connections surface charge is an important factor which may greatly affect the electrostatic interactions between membrane surface and foulants compared with pes a more negative surface was observed for δ mno2 ta pes at ph 7 fig 2e protonation deprotonation of hydroxy groups on δ mno2 may account for the enhanced electronegativity of δ mno2 ta pes lu et al 2016 additionally the pore size distribution of membranes was characterized as shown in fig 2f and fig s6 the average pore diameter of pes ta mn pes mnox ta pes and δ mno2 ta pes was 18 8 19 4 16 7 and 15 8 nm respectively the reduction in pore size and narrowed pore size distribution of δ mno2 ta pes were ascribed to the growth of δ mno2 decoration layer membranes with narrowed pore size distribution and smaller pores may help to improve the separation performance fig 2g illustrates the possible process of δ mno2 growth on pes membranes during the incubation process dissolved manganese ions were caught by vast phenolic hydroxyls to promote mnox growth on ta mn pes the amorphous mnox provided abundant active sites for mn7 adsorption followed by rapid formation of covalent linkages via mn o mn confirmed by xps at last growth of microcrystalline δ mno2 proceeded on mnox seeds forming 3d structures the morphology changes of δ mno2 growing on mnox ta pes can be roughly divided into three stages including the formation of coralline structures the growth of coral reef like structures and the evolution of 3d porous structure fig s7 the underlying base determines the superstructure and the ridge like structures on mnox ta pes played an indispensable role in building 3d micro nanostructure when no ridge like structures were present mn7 was rapidly reduced to mn4 by ta mn complexes resulting in a flat surface with large amount of nanospheres and several defects fig s8 3 2 superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity of the membranes the pes membrane possessed steady wca about 70 whose hydrophobicity was ascribed to the inherent feature of pes material introduction of organic inorganic hybrid networks endowed the ta mn pes mnox ta pes and δ mno2 ta pes membranes with outstanding wettability with initial wcas below 40 fig 3 a especially the growth of 3d coral reef like δ mno2 layer enabled the wca of δ mno2 ta pes to be reduced to 0 within 5 s compared with pes and other modified membranes fig 3b and fig s9 the underwater ocas of δ mno2 ta pes were obviously higher with above 150 for different kinds of oil including petroleum ether hexadecane cyclohexane soybean oil dichloroethane and n hexane surprisingly δ mno2 ta pes exhibited remarkable anti oil adhesion properties during static adhesion tests with hexadecane dyed red the hexadecane oil immediately escaped from δ mno2 ta pes once the pre wetted membrane was immersed in water fig 3c it was even not necessary for δ mno2 ta pes to shake to dislodge oil droplets in contrast the pes membrane was still oil covered even after vigorous shaking furthermore δ mno2 ta pes also presented excellent anti oil adhesion property during dynamic adhesion tests video s1 and s2 the synergistic effect of the 3d coral reef micro nanostructure and abundant oxygen functional groups endowed the δ mno2 ta pes membranes with superhydrophilicity lu et al 2016 the achieved characteristics enabled δ mno2 ta pes to capture water molecules to form a defect free protection film that perfectly prevented from the attachment of oil droplets to membrane surface and δ mno2 ta pes was expected to exhibit superior separation efficiency and anti fouling performance 3 3 filtration performance of the membranes 3 3 1 permeation and separation performance of the membranes the high wetting selectivity makes it great potential for the application of δ mno2 ta pes in emulsified wastewater purification fig 4 a shows the water permeation of pes ta mn pes mnox ta pes and δ mno2 ta pes compared with the moderately high permeance of pristine pes 736 3 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 ta mn pes mnox ta pes and δ mno2 ta pes showed surprisingly high water permeance up to 1000 3 878 1 and 723 9 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 respectively notably the existence of δ mno2 layer did not impact the permeation performance indicating its ultralow transmembrane resistance of water various o w emulsions including petroleum ether hexadecane cyclohexane soybean oil dichloroethane and n hexane were used for separation tests as shown in fig 4b the δ mno2 ta pes membrane had good emulsion permeability and its separation efficiency of various o w emulsions was the highest all above 98 5 outperforming others furthermore δ mno2 ta pes was compared with the membranes reported recently for o w emulsion treatment in table 1 size sieving was highly possible to be the main mechanism of ultrafiltration membrane separation the enhanced electronegativity of δ mno2 ta pes led to the redistribution of surfactants around oil droplets contributing to the demulsification process wu et al 2018 the oil droplets aggregation caused by demulsification process table s2 and the pore size reduction resulted from successful growth of the δ mno2 layer jointly promoted the rejection performance of δ mno2 ta pes besides the photographs of hexadecane in water emulsion before and after separation are presented in fig 4c in order to visualize the separation efficiency of δ mno2 ta pes it was obvious that the milky white colored feed emulsion turned transparent numerous oil droplets with uniform size were observed in the optical microscopy image of the feed emulsion whereas a clean version for the collected filtrate moreover the uv vis spectrum of the feed emulsion was strong and broad which was greatly reduced after filtration fig s10 the remarkable changes in color size distribution of dispersed oil droplets together with uv vis spectrum uncovered the effectiveness of δ mno2 ta pes on treating hexadecane in water emulsion 3 3 2 anti oil fouling performances of the membranes to explore the anti oil fouling performance of the membranes the real time separation permeance during the three cycle fouling test is shown in fig 5 a as a common research object in the treatment of oily wastewater hexadecane in water emulsion was selected as the model foulant the initial permeation flux followed the order of ta mn pes mnox ta pes pes δ mno2 ta pes a decline in filtrate permeation flux was observed initially for each membrane which was possibly attributed to pore blockages or the formation of the oil film on surface in addition compared with pes ta mn pes and mnox ta pes the decline rate of δ mno2 ta pes was much slower and it could be observed that the filtrate permeation flux of δ mno2 ta pes gradually transcended other membranes with time elapsing the decrease rate of filtrate permeation flux gradually slowed down until it approached a constant state the filtrate permeation flux of each membrane was recovered to different extent via hydraulic cleaning after three separation cycles the pure water permeance of the δ mno2 ta pes membrane surpassed pes and was very close to that of mnox ta pes although the initial permeation flux of δ mno2 ta pes was lower than other membranes the durable antifouling and high cleaning efficiency of δ mno2 ta pes accounted for this phenomenon also the favorable stability of δ mno2 ta pes fig s11 and s12 promised its excellent filtration performance during three separation cycles fig 5b shows frrb and fouling ratio of pes ta mn pes mnox ta pes and δ mno2 ta pes with hexadecane in water emulsion as a model foulant with respect to frrb the frrb values were 86 3 80 0 95 4 and 98 0 for pes ta mn pes mnox ta pes and δ mno2 ta pes respectively in order to further clarify and investigate the fouling behaviors of the membranes the oil fouling can be represented by the total of oil fouling rt b which consists of reversible oil fouling rr b and irreversible oil fouling rir b the rt b of pes was 72 5 and a 18 1 decrease in the rt b of δ mno2 ta pes was observed the proportion of rr b and rir b was found to follow a rising and declining trend respectively for mnox ta pes and δ mno2 ta pes when rt b kept comparable table s3 the results meant that the total fouling ratio of δ mno2 ta pes was reduced and the oil foulants attached to δ mno2 ta pes were easier to be removed by hydraulic cleaning proving a rising trend for anti oil fouling performance with the successive growth of δ mno2 decoration layer 3 3 3 mechanism of fouling mitigation understanding oil fouling behaviors is important for inferring the foulant membrane interactions and exploring antifouling mechanism wu et al 2022 herein four classic fouling models complete blocking intermediate blocking cake filtration and standard blocking were employed to further understand fouling behaviors dong et al 2022 he et al 2021 as shown in fig 6 the correlation coefficient r 2 of δ mno2 ta pes was highest for the standard blocking model and the highest r 2 values of pes were for intermediate blocking r2 0 982 and cake filtration r2 0 976 for pes the inherent hydrophobicity resulted in a thinner hydration layer and oil adhesion took place oil droplets were prone to be squeezed under operation pressure the intermediate blocking occurred and a dense oil film was formed on membrane surface in a short time fig s13 leading to rapid flux decrease in the early stage of filtration wang et al 2022 however standard blocking model was the dominant mechanism for δ mno2 ta pes and permeation declined gradually due to the pore blockage the difference in the dominated fouling mechanism and the smaller fouling kinetic constants of δ mno2 ta pes indicated that oil fouling of δ mno2 ta pes was greatly mitigated especially the oil cake fouling for δ mno2 ta pes the mechanism of fouling mitigation could be ascribed to the following reasons first the superhydrophilicity of δ mno2 ta pes helped build a robust hydration layer which effectively reduced the adhesion of oil to membrane surface table 2 fundamentally preventing the formation of the oil filtrate cake layer the hydration layer was also beneficial to maintaining enough transport areas of water greatly alleviating the flux decrease tendency during emulsion filtration process second the much stronger electrical repulsion between δ mno2 ta pes and sds stabilized oil droplets not only repulse negatively charged droplets but also drove the migration of surfactants promoting demulsification effect wu et al 2018 the demulsified oil droplets are unstable in the water which could be repulsed by the robust hydration layer part of the demulsified oil droplets agglomerated the oil droplets with larger size might result in a loose oil film and was easier to be removed via hydraulic cleaning third the narrowed pores of δ mno2 ta pes also contributed to the emulsion demulsification he et al 2021 last the higher rejection of δ mno2 ta pes to emulsion was conducive to decreasing pore blockages therefore the oil adhesion to δ mno2 ta pes was significantly inhibited and the passive strategy was confirmed to be effective in oil fouling mitigation to sum up with high water permeability precise separation selectivity durable oil fouling resistance and favorable stability the δ mno2 ta pes membranes showed strong application prospects in the continuous purification of oily wastewater discharged from various industrial processes 3 4 catalytic cleaning performance of the membranes during the long operational time the membrane fouling remains inevitable for δ mno2 ta pes and catalytic activation of pms by δ mno2 ta pes was investigated to evaluate its catalytic cleaning efficiency as shown in fig 7 a either hydraulic cleaning or pms cleaning was conducted after emulsion filtration and δ mno2 ta pes showed pms assisted self cleaning performance in addition δ mno2 ta pes maintained morphology integrity fig s14 and high catalytic cleaning efficiency after multi cleaning cycles indicating the robustness of δ mno2 ta pes for continuous oily wastewater purification during emulsions filtration process oil droplets adhered on surface or stuck in pores resulted in severe fouling owing to the ultra low oil adhesion of δ mno2 ta pes most of the oil droplets adhered on surface and partial oil droplets trapped in pores could be removed via hydraulic cleaning the residual foulants were difficult to remove via hydraulic cleaning causing the irreversible fouling by contrast the active species produced during pms cleaning process went deep into internal pores and conducted thorough physicochemical cleaning endowing δ mno2 ta pes with high catalytic cleaning efficiency the active species generated in the δ mno2 pms system have strong oxidation capability which contributed to the degradation of pollutants and the effective removal of oil fouling therefore the determination of active species is of paramount importance to explore the fouling removal mechanism of δ mno2 ta pes via pms cleaning as shown in fig 7b hydroxyl adduct dmpo oh and sulfate adduct dmpo so4 appeared in the δ mno2 ta pes pms system demonstrating the catalytic activity of δ mno2 ta pes by pms when reaction time was prolonged to 5 min the signals of dmpo oh and sulfate adduct dmpo so4 were gradually enhanced in addition the signal of temp 1o2 was detected in the δ mno2 ta pes pms system fig 7c comparatively no obvious signals of dmpo oh dmpo so4 and temp 1o2 was observed in the pes pms system the contribution of each active substance to the removal of oil fouling was quantitatively studied by classical quenching experiments radicals oh and so4 and singlet oxygen 1o2 in the δ mno2 pms system were captured by meoh and ffa respectively as shown in fig 7d the frri and rir i values of δ mno2 ta pes after pms cleaning were 99 7 and 0 3 outperforming the membrane after hydraulic cleaning whose values were 83 2 and 16 8 respectively the results showed that irreversible fouling could be thoroughly removed via pms cleaning when meoh existed the rir i value increased from 0 3 to 3 4 suggesting that radicals contributed to 19 of reduction in irreversible fouling in the pms cleaning and the rir i value increased to 9 6 after the addition of ffa indicating the major contribution of 1o2 to the decline of rir i in the pms cleaning about 56 in addition other nonradical processes such as reactive δ mno2 pms complexes or a direct electron transfer process might contributed to the removal of the residual irreversible contaminants wang et al 2018 2015 as depicted in fig 8 both radical and non radical oxidation pathways existed in the δ mno2 pms system contributing to fouling removal compared with the radical pathway the nonradical pathway made greater contribution to the removal of irreversible fouling in pms cleaning the high catalytic activity of δ mno2 ta pes was attributed to the high surface area of the δ mno2 decoration layer which provided abundant active sites for pms oxidation rong and liu 2019 the generated active substances helped degrade oil foulants making it easy to escape from membranes yan et al 2019 hence the δ mno2 ta pes membrane possessed high catalytic cleaning efficiency confirming the effectiveness of the active strategy for oil fouling removal in continuous oily wastewater purification 4 conclusions in this work an effective strategy was proposed for fouling control in continuous oily wastewater purification with combining the passive strategy for fouling mitigation and the active strategy for fouling removal the in situ growth of the δ mno2 layer from the membrane surface resulted in the formation of 3d coral reef like structures the synergistic effect of 3d micro nanostructure and abundant oxygen functional groups endowed the δ mno2 ta pes membranes with fascinating superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity the δ mno2 ta pes membrane possessed high water permeation flux 723 9 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 was able to effectively purify various o w emulsions with rejection above 98 5 and showed excellent antifouling properties with frrb of 98 0 benefiting from the enhanced surface properties of δ mno2 ta pes oil adhesion was fundamentally prevented greatly mitigating oil cake layer fouling and ensuring its durable anti oil fouling performance in three cycles of fouling tests furthermore the cleaning efficiency of δ mno2 ta pes was greatly boosted by the pms cleaning both radical and nonradical pathways took place during pms cleaning process and the active substances generated in the nonradical pathway played the dominant role in the removal of oil fouling it was expected to provide a new insight of the design of the fouling control strategy with broadening the application of uf membranes in the oil wastewater treatment in addition further researches are needed to assess whether such combined antifouling strategy can also be applied to the treatment of oily wastewater in other harsh

15331,membrane based technology has been confirmed as an effective way to treat emulsified oily wastewater however membrane fouling is still one of practical challenges in long term operation herein a novel passive active combined strategy was proposed to control membrane fouling in continuous oily wastewater purification where the δ mno2 decoration layer helped to reduce the total fouling ratio passive strategy for fouling mitigation and the catalytic cleaning effectively removed the irreversible oil fouling active strategy for fouling removal the functional membrane was prepared via in situ modification referred to as δ mno2 ta pes the morphology crystalline phase chemical structure and surface properties of the membranes were systematically characterized compared with pes the δ mno2 ta pes possessed superhydrophilicity enhanced electronegativity and narrowed pore size the δ mno2 ta pes achieved high water permeation flux of 723 9 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 excellent oil rejection with separation efficiency above 98 5 for various emulsions and durable anti oil fouling performance with frrb of 98 0 notably the oil cake layer fouling on δ mno2 ta pes was greatly alleviated owing to its enhanced surface properties in addition δ mno2 ta pes showed high cleaning efficiency in the peroxymonosulfate pms cleaning process where the radical and nonradical pathways occurred simultaneously and the active substances generated in the nonradical process especially 1o2 were considered as the main contributor to the reduction of irreversible fouling overall the novel strategy of fouling control ensured the efficient operation of ultrafiltration membranes for the continuous oily wastewater purification graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords oily wastewater ultrafiltration membrane fouling control superhydrophilic surface catalytic cleaning data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the oily water treatment is crucial since the surging oily wastewater discharged from industrial production daily life and frequent marine oil spill accidents threatens the ecosystem and human health shannon et al 2008 conventional methods including skimmers centrifugation air flotation coagulation flocculation have been employed to purify oily wastewater shi et al 2022 zhu et al 2016 nevertheless these traditional approaches are inapplicable to finely emulsified wastewater chen et al 2022 membrane technology stands out with acknowledged as an efficient technology to solve this challenge not only owing to its facile operation low cost and negligible environmental impact but also its high separation accuracy via a size sieving mechanism kota et al 2012 werber et al 2016 yang et al 2012 however the membrane fouling still remains the achilles heel which restricts its practical application on a large scale in oily wastewater purification nayak et al 2021 yang et al 2018 as a typical type of spreadable foulants oil droplets tend to adhere to the polymeric membrane block pores and then form a continuous oil film on membrane surface resulting in severe fouling during emulsions filtration process therefore effective fouling control strategies are of great importance for continuous oily wastewater purification hydrophilic modification as the important content of the passive antifouling strategies has shown high efficiency in fouling control of spreadable oil zhang et al 2016 through hydrophilic modification the hydrophobic interactions between oil droplets and membrane surface are weakened and the adsorption or settlement of oil to membrane is greatly reduced gao et al 2018 basically the single strategy established only by hydrophilic modification is not efficient enough for fouling control in long term operation since no hydrophilic modified membranes can guarantee the complete rejection of oil once small sized oil droplets come into membrane pores oil adhesion and pore blockages take place with leading to the membrane fouling the reversible fouling is easy to be removed by physical cleaning whereas it is difficult to cope with irreversible fouling kimura et al 2004 porcelli and judd 2010 wang et al 2014 inspired by the active strategies against biofouling qi et al 2018 wang et al 2019b destruction of oil droplets tightly adhered to membrane or trapped in pores is of great significance for fouling control in oily wastewater treatment the catalytic cleaning method has been confirmed to be an effective method to remove the membrane fouling he et al 2019 li et al 2022 zhao et al 2022 sulfate radical based advanced oxidation process sr aop is gaining popularity in fouling removal as sulfate radicals have the advantages of higher activity over a wide ph range and longer half life liu et al 2022 peroxymonosulfate pms as a stable and eco friendly solid with excellent water solubility could be activated to generate sulfate radicals via various methods including heat uv transition metal ions and carbon materials wang et al 2018 the free radicals produced during advanced oxidation process help degrade organic contaminants and perform efficient physicochemical cleaning ma et al 2021 based on the above consideration a passive active combined strategy shows great potential in realization of continuous emulsion separation distinguished from most polymers some inorganic materials possess inherent outstanding robustness hydrophilicity and catalytic characteristic which favor to construct the organic inorganic hybrid membranes with superhydrophilicity and high catalytic cleaning effectiveness ma et al 2022 wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 among them manganese dioxide mno2 emerges with excellent catalytic performances and shows enormous application prospects in the oily wastewater treatment owing to the unique properties of easy synthesis low cost and good environmental compatibility chen et al 2010 kim et al 2013 yang et al 2021 to date mno2 based catalysts applied in wastewater treatment consist of different crystal phases including α mno2 β mno2 δ mno2 and γ mno2 which exhibit multiple morphologies in different dimensions li et al 2016 especially the layered δ mno2 aroused the great interest of researchers and the nanosheet possesses itself with a high specific surface area which is helpful to take full advantage of active sites rong and liu 2019 in boyom tatchemo et al s work boyom tatchemo et al 2020 different kinds of the δ mno2 catalysts were successfully plasma synthesized and the catalysts were active enough to activate dissolved o2 which contributed to the high removal efficiency of tartrazin yellow however how to build bridges between membranes and mno2 remains a challenge blending is a common method munnawar et al 2017 safarpour et al 2016 and it tends to cause the aggregation of mno2 nanoparticles with worsening the compatibility between fillers and polymer networks moreover a large number of mno2 nanoparticles cannot be fully used and the improvement in membrane performance is limited thus hindering the application by contrast in situ strategy should be a reliable way to achieve a hybrid membrane with uniform distribution of inorganic materials li et al 2021 2017 herein a passive active combined strategy was proposed to control fouling in the continuous oily wastewater treatment tannic acid ta was employed to realize the in situ growth of δ mno2 layer from membrane surface the strong coordination bonds between the catechol of ta and mn2 provided abundant nucleation sites for further mineralization the 3d coral reef like micro nanostructures endowed the commercial membrane with superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity showing remarkable anti oil fouling performance in addition the catalytic δ mno2 greatly enhanced the pms cleaning efficiency due to the removal of oil foulants via reactive radicals and nonradical pathways our work provides a new insight into the fouling control strategy for oily wastewater purification 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials polyethersulfone pes ultrafiltration 150 kda membrane utilized as the substrate for in

characterization of the membranes the surface morphologies of the pes ta mn pes mnox ta pes and δ mno2 ta pes membranes were visualized by sem with different magnification times as shown in fig 1 a the surface of the unmodified pes membrane was smooth and the submicron sized pores were evenly distributed on it the morphology fig 1b following ta mn coating was largely unchanged due to the uniform deposition of ta mn complex interestingly the smooth surface changed into ridge like nanostructures after 60 c incubation treatment mnox ta pes fig 1c the increase of temperature accelerated the hydrolysis and oswald ripening of manganese ions resulting in the deposition of amorphous manganese oxides on the surface of ta mn membranes tsai et al 2015 with microcrystalline mno2 growing along the ridge like structures 3d coral reef like δ mno2 morphology was formed on the surface of δ mno2 ta pes fig 1d in terms of surface roughness the average roughness ra of the pes ta mn pes mnox ta pes and δ mno2 ta pes membranes was 5 7 4 0 25 1 and 92 3 nm respectively fig s2 the decreased ra of ta mn pes might be ascribed to the deposition of ta mn complex while the manganese oxides growing from mnox ta pes and δ mno2 ta pes membrane surface dramatically increased membrane roughness surface roughness changes influenced wettability according to wenzel and cassie protocols yang et al 2020 indicated the best hydrophilicity of the δ mno2 ta pes membrane the afm analysis well matched with the sem and other data reported in other literatures xie et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 besides the eds signal of mn was mainly concentrated on the membrane surface whereas the s element was distributed throughout the cross section indicating the coverage of δ mno2 on pes surface fig 1e the crystalline phase of nanosheets grown from membrane surface was characterized by xrd there was no obvious diffraction peak in xrd spectrum of ta mn pes and mnox ta pes fig s3 by contrast as depicted in fig 2 a the xrd pattern of δ mno2 ta showed four diffraction peaks at 13 0 24 2 36 7 and 65 9 which were well assigned to the 001 002 100 and 110 planes of δ mno2 pdf 80 1098 d wang et al 2019 furthermore the microstructure of δ mno2 nanosheets was presented in the hrtem image fig 2b and the lattice fringe with a spacing of 0 69 nm can be clearly observed which corresponds to the 001 planes of δ mno2 zheng et al 2021 the surface chemical compositions of the pes ta mn pes mnox ta pes and δ mno2 ta pes membranes were further investigated by xps and ftir fig s4 as shown in fig 2c the peaks of o 1 s n 1 s c 1 s s 2 s and s 2p were observed from the xps survey spectrum of pes consistent with other reports xia et al 2022 in comparison the percentage of mn and o elements of δ mno2 ta pes was increased to 14 9 and 40 6 table s1 respectively and the peaks of s 2 s and 2p disappeared according to the further xps analysis fig 2d and fig s5 two characteristic peaks assigned to mn4 654 7 and 643 8 ev and mn3 653 7 and 642 0 ev can be clearly observed from the δ mno2 ta pes surface with an energy gap of 11 8 ev lei et al 2020 the binding energy of o 1 s could be divided into different interactions of mn o mn mn oh c o c o o and h o h ko et al 2019 respectively this result suggested the complete oxidation of ta mn complexes to form δ mno2 the results verified the feasibility of the modification method with realizing the successful in situ growth of δ mno2 from commercial membrane surfaces via ta as connections surface charge is an important factor which may greatly affect the electrostatic interactions between membrane surface and foulants compared with pes a more negative surface was observed for δ mno2 ta pes at ph 7 fig 2e protonation deprotonation of hydroxy groups on δ mno2 may account for the enhanced electronegativity of δ mno2 ta pes lu et al 2016 additionally the pore size distribution of membranes was characterized as shown in fig 2f and fig s6 the average pore diameter of pes ta mn pes mnox ta pes and δ mno2 ta pes was 18 8 19 4 16 7 and 15 8 nm respectively the reduction in pore size and narrowed pore size distribution of δ mno2 ta pes were ascribed to the growth of δ mno2 decoration layer membranes with narrowed pore size distribution and smaller pores may help to improve the separation performance fig 2g illustrates the possible process of δ mno2 growth on pes membranes during the incubation process dissolved manganese ions were caught by vast phenolic hydroxyls to promote mnox growth on ta mn pes the amorphous mnox provided abundant active sites for mn7 adsorption followed by rapid formation of covalent linkages via mn o mn confirmed by xps at last growth of microcrystalline δ mno2 proceeded on mnox seeds forming 3d structures the morphology changes of δ mno2 growing on mnox ta pes can be roughly divided into three stages including the formation of coralline structures the growth of coral reef like structures and the evolution of 3d porous structure fig s7 the underlying base determines the superstructure and the ridge like structures on mnox ta pes played an indispensable role in building 3d micro nanostructure when no ridge like structures were present mn7 was rapidly reduced to mn4 by ta mn complexes resulting in a flat surface with large amount of nanospheres and several defects fig s8 3 2 superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity of the membranes the pes membrane possessed steady wca about 70 whose hydrophobicity was ascribed to the inherent feature of pes material introduction of organic inorganic hybrid networks endowed the ta mn pes mnox ta pes and δ mno2 ta pes membranes with outstanding wettability with initial wcas below 40 fig 3 a especially the growth of 3d coral reef like δ mno2 layer enabled the wca of δ mno2 ta pes to be reduced to 0 within 5 s compared with pes and other modified membranes fig 3b and fig s9 the underwater ocas of δ mno2 ta pes were obviously higher with above 150 for different kinds of oil including petroleum ether hexadecane cyclohexane soybean oil dichloroethane and n hexane surprisingly δ mno2 ta pes exhibited remarkable anti oil adhesion properties during static adhesion tests with hexadecane dyed red the hexadecane oil immediately escaped from δ mno2 ta pes once the pre wetted membrane was immersed in water fig 3c it was even not necessary for δ mno2 ta pes to shake to dislodge oil droplets in contrast the pes membrane was still oil covered even after vigorous shaking furthermore δ mno2 ta pes also presented excellent anti oil adhesion property during dynamic adhesion tests video s1 and s2 the synergistic effect of the 3d coral reef micro nanostructure and abundant oxygen functional groups endowed the δ mno2 ta pes membranes with superhydrophilicity lu et al 2016 the achieved characteristics enabled δ mno2 ta pes to capture water molecules to form a defect free protection film that perfectly prevented from the attachment of oil droplets to membrane surface and δ mno2 ta pes was expected to exhibit superior separation efficiency and anti fouling performance 3 3 filtration performance of the membranes 3 3 1 permeation and separation performance of the membranes the high wetting selectivity makes it great potential for the application of δ mno2 ta pes in emulsified wastewater purification fig 4 a shows the water permeation of pes ta mn pes mnox ta pes and δ mno2 ta pes compared with the moderately high permeance of pristine pes 736 3 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 ta mn pes mnox ta pes and δ mno2 ta pes showed surprisingly high water permeance up to 1000 3 878 1 and 723 9 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 respectively notably the existence of δ mno2 layer did not impact the permeation performance indicating its ultralow transmembrane resistance of water various o w emulsions including petroleum ether hexadecane cyclohexane soybean oil dichloroethane and n hexane were used for separation tests as shown in fig 4b the δ mno2 ta pes membrane had good emulsion permeability and its separation efficiency of various o w emulsions was the highest all above 98 5 outperforming others furthermore δ mno2 ta pes was compared with the membranes reported recently for o w emulsion treatment in table 1 size sieving was highly possible to be the main mechanism of ultrafiltration membrane separation the enhanced electronegativity of δ mno2 ta pes led to the redistribution of surfactants around oil droplets contributing to the demulsification process wu et al 2018 the oil droplets aggregation caused by demulsification process table s2 and the pore size reduction resulted from successful growth of the δ mno2 layer jointly promoted the rejection performance of δ mno2 ta pes besides the photographs of hexadecane in water emulsion before and after separation are presented in fig 4c in order to visualize the separation efficiency of δ mno2 ta pes it was obvious that the milky white colored feed emulsion turned transparent numerous oil droplets with uniform size were observed in the optical microscopy image of the feed emulsion whereas a clean version for the collected filtrate moreover the uv vis spectrum of the feed emulsion was strong and broad which was greatly reduced after filtration fig s10 the remarkable changes in color size distribution of dispersed oil droplets together with uv vis spectrum uncovered the effectiveness of δ mno2 ta pes on treating hexadecane in water emulsion 3 3 2 anti oil fouling performances of the membranes to explore the anti oil fouling performance of the membranes the real time separation permeance during the three cycle fouling test is shown in fig 5 a as a common research object in the treatment of oily wastewater hexadecane in water emulsion was selected as the model foulant the initial permeation flux followed the order of ta mn pes mnox ta pes pes δ mno2 ta pes a decline in filtrate permeation flux was observed initially for each membrane which was possibly attributed to pore blockages or the formation of the oil film on surface in addition compared with pes ta mn pes and mnox ta pes the decline rate of δ mno2 ta pes was much slower and it could be observed that the filtrate permeation flux of δ mno2 ta pes gradually transcended other membranes with time elapsing the decrease rate of filtrate permeation flux gradually slowed down until it approached a constant state the filtrate permeation flux of each membrane was recovered to different extent via hydraulic cleaning after three separation cycles the pure water permeance of the δ mno2 ta pes membrane surpassed pes and was very close to that of mnox ta pes although the initial permeation flux of δ mno2 ta pes was lower than other membranes the durable antifouling and high cleaning efficiency of δ mno2 ta pes accounted for this phenomenon also the favorable stability of δ mno2 ta pes fig s11 and s12 promised its excellent filtration performance during three separation cycles fig 5b shows frrb and fouling ratio of pes ta mn pes mnox ta pes and δ mno2 ta pes with hexadecane in water emulsion as a model foulant with respect to frrb the frrb values were 86 3 80 0 95 4 and 98 0 for pes ta mn pes mnox ta pes and δ mno2 ta pes respectively in order to further clarify and investigate the fouling behaviors of the membranes the oil fouling can be represented by the total of oil fouling rt b which consists of reversible oil fouling rr b and irreversible oil fouling rir b the rt b of pes was 72 5 and a 18 1 decrease in the rt b of δ mno2 ta pes was observed the proportion of rr b and rir b was found to follow a rising and declining trend respectively for mnox ta pes and δ mno2 ta pes when rt b kept comparable table s3 the results meant that the total fouling ratio of δ mno2 ta pes was reduced and the oil foulants attached to δ mno2 ta pes were easier to be removed by hydraulic cleaning proving a rising trend for anti oil fouling performance with the successive growth of δ mno2 decoration layer 3 3 3 mechanism of fouling mitigation understanding oil fouling behaviors is important for inferring the foulant membrane interactions and exploring antifouling mechanism wu et al 2022 herein four classic fouling models complete blocking intermediate blocking cake filtration and standard blocking were employed to further understand fouling behaviors dong et al 2022 he et al 2021 as shown in fig 6 the correlation coefficient r 2 of δ mno2 ta pes was highest for the standard blocking model and the highest r 2 values of pes were for intermediate blocking r2 0 982 and cake filtration r2 0 976 for pes the inherent hydrophobicity resulted in a thinner hydration layer and oil adhesion took place oil droplets were prone to be squeezed under operation pressure the intermediate blocking occurred and a dense oil film was formed on membrane surface in a short time fig s13 leading to rapid flux decrease in the early stage of filtration wang et al 2022 however standard blocking model was the dominant mechanism for δ mno2 ta pes and permeation declined gradually due to the pore blockage the difference in the dominated fouling mechanism and the smaller fouling kinetic constants of δ mno2 ta pes indicated that oil fouling of δ mno2 ta pes was greatly mitigated especially the oil cake fouling for δ mno2 ta pes the mechanism of fouling mitigation could be ascribed to the following reasons first the superhydrophilicity of δ mno2 ta pes helped build a robust hydration layer which effectively reduced the adhesion of oil to membrane surface table 2 fundamentally preventing the formation of the oil filtrate cake layer the hydration layer was also beneficial to maintaining enough transport areas of water greatly alleviating the flux decrease tendency during emulsion filtration process second the much stronger electrical repulsion between δ mno2 ta pes and sds stabilized oil droplets not only repulse negatively charged droplets but also drove the migration of surfactants promoting demulsification effect wu et al 2018 the demulsified oil droplets are unstable in the water which could be repulsed by the robust hydration layer part of the demulsified oil droplets agglomerated the oil droplets with larger size might result in a loose oil film and was easier to be removed via hydraulic cleaning third the narrowed pores of δ mno2 ta pes also contributed to the emulsion demulsification he et al 2021 last the higher rejection of δ mno2 ta pes to emulsion was conducive to decreasing pore blockages therefore the oil adhesion to δ mno2 ta pes was significantly inhibited and the passive strategy was confirmed to be effective in oil fouling mitigation to sum up with high water permeability precise separation selectivity durable oil fouling resistance and favorable stability the δ mno2 ta pes membranes showed strong application prospects in the continuous purification of oily wastewater discharged from various industrial processes 3 4 catalytic cleaning performance of the membranes during the long operational time the membrane fouling remains inevitable for δ mno2 ta pes and catalytic activation of pms by δ mno2 ta pes was investigated to evaluate its catalytic cleaning efficiency as shown in fig 7 a either hydraulic cleaning or pms cleaning was conducted after emulsion filtration and δ mno2 ta pes showed pms assisted self cleaning performance in addition δ mno2 ta pes maintained morphology integrity fig s14 and high catalytic cleaning efficiency after multi cleaning cycles indicating the robustness of δ mno2 ta pes for continuous oily wastewater purification during emulsions filtration process oil droplets adhered on surface or stuck in pores resulted in severe fouling owing to the ultra low oil adhesion of δ mno2 ta pes most of the oil droplets adhered on surface and partial oil droplets trapped in pores could be removed via hydraulic cleaning the residual foulants were difficult to remove via hydraulic cleaning causing the irreversible fouling by contrast the active species produced during pms cleaning process went deep into internal pores and conducted thorough physicochemical cleaning endowing δ mno2 ta pes with high catalytic cleaning efficiency the active species generated in the δ mno2 pms system have strong oxidation capability which contributed to the degradation of pollutants and the effective removal of oil fouling therefore the determination of active species is of paramount importance to explore the fouling removal mechanism of δ mno2 ta pes via pms cleaning as shown in fig 7b hydroxyl adduct dmpo oh and sulfate adduct dmpo so4 appeared in the δ mno2 ta pes pms system demonstrating the catalytic activity of δ mno2 ta pes by pms when reaction time was prolonged to 5 min the signals of dmpo oh and sulfate adduct dmpo so4 were gradually enhanced in addition the signal of temp 1o2 was detected in the δ mno2 ta pes pms system fig 7c comparatively no obvious signals of dmpo oh dmpo so4 and temp 1o2 was observed in the pes pms system the contribution of each active substance to the removal of oil fouling was quantitatively studied by classical quenching experiments radicals oh and so4 and singlet oxygen 1o2 in the δ mno2 pms system were captured by meoh and ffa respectively as shown in fig 7d the frri and rir i values of δ mno2 ta pes after pms cleaning were 99 7 and 0 3 outperforming the membrane after hydraulic cleaning whose values were 83 2 and 16 8 respectively the results showed that irreversible fouling could be thoroughly removed via pms cleaning when meoh existed the rir i value increased from 0 3 to 3 4 suggesting that radicals contributed to 19 of reduction in irreversible fouling in the pms cleaning and the rir i value increased to 9 6 after the addition of ffa indicating the major contribution of 1o2 to the decline of rir i in the pms cleaning about 56 in addition other nonradical processes such as reactive δ mno2 pms complexes or a direct electron transfer process might contributed to the removal of the residual irreversible contaminants wang et al 2018 2015 as depicted in fig 8 both radical and non radical oxidation pathways existed in the δ mno2 pms system contributing to fouling removal compared with the radical pathway the nonradical pathway made greater contribution to the removal of irreversible fouling in pms cleaning the high catalytic activity of δ mno2 ta pes was attributed to the high surface area of the δ mno2 decoration layer which provided abundant active sites for pms oxidation rong and liu 2019 the generated active substances helped degrade oil foulants making it easy to escape from membranes yan et al 2019 hence the δ mno2 ta pes membrane possessed high catalytic cleaning efficiency confirming the effectiveness of the active strategy for oil fouling removal in continuous oily wastewater purification 4 conclusions in this work an effective strategy was proposed for fouling control in continuous oily wastewater purification with combining the passive strategy for fouling mitigation and the active strategy for fouling removal the in situ growth of the δ mno2 layer from the membrane surface resulted in the formation of 3d coral reef like structures the synergistic effect of 3d micro nanostructure and abundant oxygen functional groups endowed the δ mno2 ta pes membranes with fascinating superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity the δ mno2 ta pes membrane possessed high water permeation flux 723 9 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 was able to effectively purify various o w emulsions with rejection above 98 5 and showed excellent antifouling properties with frrb of 98 0 benefiting from the enhanced surface properties of δ mno2 ta pes oil adhesion was fundamentally prevented greatly mitigating oil cake layer fouling and ensuring its durable anti oil fouling performance in three cycles of fouling tests furthermore the cleaning efficiency of δ mno2 ta pes was greatly boosted by the pms cleaning both radical and nonradical pathways took place during pms cleaning process and the active substances generated in the nonradical pathway played the dominant role in the removal of oil fouling it was expected to provide a new insight of the design of the fouling control strategy with broadening the application of uf membranes in the oil wastewater treatment in addition further researches are needed to assess whether such combined antifouling strategy can also be applied to the treatment of oily wastewater in other harsh conditions or applicable to other commercial membranes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

15332,dissimilatory sulfate reduction based processes have long been a viable option for treating acidic metal laden wastewater amw such processes can be optimized through enhancing sulfidogenic activity and the microbial consortia s resilience against a harsh environment this study investigated how granular and flocculent sulfate reducing bacteria srb sludge respond to amw as well as the mechanisms through which they adapt to the wastewater with particular focuses on the stability of the sulfidogenic activities metal removal and the bacteria s resistance over the long term the flocculent srb lost more than 50 of their treatment capacity after 35 days of treating amw with the presence of cd2 cu2 zn2 and ni2 at 30 mg l each under ph 4 5 in contrast the granular srb maintained its metal removal rate at 91 throughout the 161 day trial despite the srb abundance remaining at approximate 40 organics partial oxidizing genera desulfobulbus and desulfobacter began to dominate due to their kinetic advantage the extracellular glycosyl compositions were revealed to be critical for the stability of the granular structure and microbial activity as the extracellular proteins disintegrated irreversible usage the molecular dynamic simulation the mobility of the metal ions in the srb granular system was suppressed by the presence of a more diverse glycosyl composition compared with the flocculent system 10 50 diffusion coefficients differences all of the identified glycosyls especially xylose and rhamnose exhibited strong interactions with cu2 470 kj mol 1 while the maximum binding strength of cd2 to glycosyls was greater than 40 kj mol 1 suggesting a low cd2 complexation efficiency the findings of this study shed light on the defensive mechanisms of srb granules against multi metal stress and provide clues for efficient amw treatment keywords sulfate reduction granular sludge metal removal sulfate reducing bacteria data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sulfuric metal laden wastewater from such industries as leather tanning kraft pulping and acid mine drainage contains high acidity and high toxic metal content and causes some of the most severe pollution of water and soil across the world kefeni et al 2017 naidu et al 2019 in view of hydrogen sulfide s ability to facilitate in situ metal precipitation via dissimilatory sulfate reduction while also producing alkalinity to neutralize acidic water sulfate reducing bacteria srb mediated biological sulfur conversion bsc has long been considered the primary option for treating acidic metal laden wastewater amw ayangbenro et al 2018 sun et al 2020 srb can survive in a wide variety of environments temperatures ranging from 0 to 100 ºc salinities ranging from freshwater to halite saturated solutions and ph ranging from 3 to 9 8 mackenzie 2005 bsc based treatments are therefore expected to be highly applicable to a variety of industrial wastewater furthermore approximately 0 32 to 0 41 usd m3 was estimated to cover capital operation and maintenance costs for bsc technologies over a 10 to 30 year duration making it nearly the most cost effective method for simultaneously removing sulfate and metals kempton et al 2003 bio fgd and thioteq metal are two recently developed bsc technologies for wet flue gas desulfurization wastewater treatment and metal recovery from acid mine drainage respectively and their practicability and cost effectiveness are widely acknowledged in the industry chen et al 2020 das et al 2022 weijma et al 2022 for such bsc based processes to be effective a high level of sulfidogenic activity as well as a high sludge concentration should be maintained however srb s low sludge yield 0 02 kg vss kg cod chemical oxygen demand and sensitivity to the growth environment e g toxic metals ph temperature cod s ratio undermine its overall practicality and applicability hao et al 2015 abo elsoud and abo alkasem 2022 considering that granular sludge has collective defense against environmental stresses high treatment efficiency and can be easily separated from the effluent srb granules have been developed for sulfate laden municipal wastewater treatment in our previous study hao et al 2013 the granulation was able to attain a sludge concentration of 22 g l with 44 srb abundance desulfobulbus desulfobacter and desulfomicrobium being the predominant genera and an average granule diameter of 420 142 μm hao et al 2013 the organic loading rate for that particular granular system reached 13 3 kg cod m3 day typical loading of 2 0 3 5 kg cod m3 day and the sulfate reduction rate even reached 503 mg s l h or 6 times the typical value for flocculent sludge systems tsui et al 2016 qi et al 2022 such performance has given us the confidence to expect that srb granular sludge has the potential and reliability for a broader range of wastewater treatment applications and a better chance of surviving harsh environments than flocculent sludge this confidence in granules superiority in treating amw however needs to be confirmed through examining and comparing the performance in greater detail over the longer term as there are aspects where granular sludge does not show clear cut superiority over flocculent sludge for instance regardless of reactor scale and influent substrate for both granular and flocculent sludge desulfovibrio desulfobulbus desulfomicrobium and desulfobacter are the most dominant srb genera inside the reactor in other words microbial analysis alone does not verify the superior performance of the srb granules hao et al 2014 kosugi et al 2022 besides extracellular polymeric substances eps which are the microorganisms protective and active slime inside both granular and flocculent sludge have been found to keep steady within a similar range 90 200 mg g vss sahinkaya et al 2018 what the above has indicated is that there are fundamental issues to be addressed before granular sludge based amw treatment can be promulgated these issues can be summarized as one whether or not srb granules can survive an acidic multi metal environment i e the simultaneous presence of cd2 cu2 zn2 and ni2 and still keep up their sulfidogenic activities over an extended period of time two how the granules microorganism consortia will respond to metal stress and three what are their defense mechanisms against such stress this study therefore applies both flocculent and granular srb sludge to treat amw in a long term operation to examine and compare their performance the evaluations are done in terms of metal removal sulfidogenic activities changes in microbial communities and the physicochemical and biological characteristics of the srb the adaptive response mechanisms of the granular and flocculent consortia to the stress presented by the acidic metallic environment are further investigated using molecular dynamic simulation the findings of this study provide first hand information on the potential and reliability of using srb granules to treat sulfuric metal laden industrial wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup and operation the experiments were conducted in two continuous polyvinyl chloride pvc reactors with identical height 600 mm internal diameter 60 mm and working volume 1 5 l for the granular sludge reactor hereafter rg the volume of granular srb sludge was 1 0 l 12 4 1 7 g vss l which had been seeded from a pre cultured sulfate reducing reactor the resulting initial concentration of volatile suspended solids vss was therefore 8 0 0 56 g l for the flocculent sludge reactor hereafter rf the inoculum was obtained from a sulfate reduction reactor treating saline domestic wastewater obtained from sha tin sewage treatment works in hong kong with sludge concentration in terms of vss identical with rg details of the inoculum operating conditions of the reactors and influent substrates are provided in tables s1 and s2 supplementary information and table 1 respectively the wastewater used in the study was synthesized as per our previous research hao et al 2013 and glucose and acetate were used as the sources of organic carbon glucose acetate 4 1 while sulfate was added at a concentration of 500 mgs l to tune the cod sulfate ratio to the desired 2 the ph of the content was adjusted to 4 5 using 1 m hcl cucl2 2h2o zncl2 nicl2 h2o and cd no3 2 were used to prepare metal stock solutions at concentrations of 1 g l jong and parry 2003 which were then added to the influent according to the desired concentrations of the individual metals ni2 cu2 cd2 zn2 table 1 to avoid contamination and putrefaction fresh influent was prepared every 12 h and fed continuously into the reactor via its bottom inlet 2 2 sulfidogenic activity the sulfidogenic activities of the granules and flocs were determined via the biochemical sulfide potential bsp test chen et al 2018 the inocula for which were obtained periodically from the rg and rf the batch reactors were designed to have a sludge concentration of 5000 mgvss l and received the same influent as rg and rf but without the addition of metals to shorten the duration of the test the influent was diluted twice using cod at 1500 mg l and sulfate at 250 mgs l nitrogen gas was used to flush the headspace in the reactors for 15 min prior to each batch cycle to ensure anoxic conditions liquid samples were drawn periodically to analyze the sulfate and sulfide contents as well as ph 2 3 analytical methods liquid samples were collected periodically to determine the metal removal and sulfide production efficiencies of the rg and rf the sulfate concentration was determined using an ion chromatogram hic20a super shimadzu corporation equipped with an ic sa2 analytical column and a conductivity detector the concentration of dissolved sulfide was determined using the methylene blue method eaton et al 2005 the concentrations of the dissolved ions of the metals ni2 cu2 cd2 zn2 were determined using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer optima 5300 dv perkin elmer instruments usa the vss of the inocula was determined using standard methods eaton et al 2005 eps were extracted from the flocs and granules using formaldehyde naoh liu and fang 2002 the content of polysaccharides was determined using the gaudy 1962 anthrone method with glucose as the standard and the protein content was determined using a modified lowry colorimetric method with bovine serum albumin as the standard dc protein assay

which can be found in hao et al 2016 images of the samples were procured using a confocal laser scanning microscope clsm lsm duo7 carl zeiss and analyzed using the imagej software suite national institute of health usa from each sample more than thirty images were taken from randomly selected areas and the presence of live and dead microorganisms was quantified via the relative abundance of green live and red dead pixels 2 4 microbial community and proteomic analysis three samples each were collected from the rg and the rf one at the beginning one at the middle and the other at the end of the experiment to analyze the microbial communities in terms of total 16s rrna gene content via illumina miseq the illumina sequencing was provided by sangon biotech shanghai co ltd the procedures for the dna extraction pcr amplification pyrosequencing and data analysis are detailed in section a of the supplementary information si 2 5 modeling and simulation the main metal resistance mechanism by eps is the formation and sequestration of heavy metals in complexes teitzel and parsek 2003 gupta and diwan 2017 to gain insight into this interaction between the eps and the metal ions molecular dynamics md simulations were performed with the gromacs package version 2018 8 the initial configuration was constructed by uniformly mixing pre determined glycosyl compositions and metal ions in a 6 6 6 nm3 container the concentrations of the components were consistent with the experimental data any excess positive charge was neutralized by cl anions the details are given in table s3 the glycosyl and metal ions were modelled by the gromos54a7 force field schmid et al 2011 the lennard jones lj parameters for ni2 and cd2 were adopted lennard jones 1931 water molecules were characterized using the spc e model berendsen et al 1987 hoffmann et al 1999 de araujo et al 2007 van der waals vdw was calculated in terms of lj potential and electrostatic forces were computed via the particle mesh ewald method with a cutoff of 1 2 nm darden et al 1993 the initial configurations were energy minimized using a steepest descent algorithm followed by a 200 ps equilibration at 298 k and 1 bar then 50 ns md runs were carried out under the npt constant pressure and temperature ensemble at the same temperature and pressure which were respectively controlled by a nosé hoover thermostat hoover 1985 and a parrinello rahman barostat nosé 1984 the leapfrog algorithm was applied to integrate the equations of motion with a time step of 1 fs three dimensional periodic boundary conditions were applied to the simulation systems 3 results and discussion 3 1 metal removal efficiency and sulfidogenic activity fig 1 illustrates the long term performances 161 days of the rg and rf s metal removal as this study is primarily concerned with metal removal and sulfidogenic activity sufficient cod was supplied to ensure that sulfidogensis indeed occurred throughout the course of the experiment the granular sulfidogenic system rg exhibited more stable and efficient metal removal than rf the average concentrations of cd2 cu2 zn2 and ni2 in the effluent were 4 1 0 97 0 4 0 18 1 1 0 46 and 1 3 0 70 mg l respectively in other words the removal efficiencies for all these metals were greater than 90 however the cd2 cu2 and ni2 concentrations in the rf effluent reached approximately 15 20 mg l after about 35 days of operation decreasing the metal removal efficiency from the initial 80 to 32 which is for the most part attributable to insufficient sulfide production as metal sulfide precipitation was the main mechanism of metal removal ni2 was the first metal to break through the rf column reactor and it reached about 14 3 mg l on day 37 with a 50 removal efficiency decreasing to 32 by day 121 in a biological process metals can be removed through 1 adsorption including chemical adsorption onto an organic substrate and biosorption onto microorganisms and 2 chemical precipitation i e sulfide hydroxide li and yu 2014 it is generally believed that adsorption chemical and through microorganisms contributes 5 of metal removal and the adsorbed metals can be released if the bulk liquid undergoes changes in its conditions ph concentration and temperature qian et al 2016 the precipitation potential of metal sulfides in the sulfidogensis systems i e rg and rf was evaluated using visual minteq based on thermodynamic calculations table s4 once the sulfide concentration exceeded 100 mgs l more than 88 of the metals could be precipitated the srb granules outperformed the flocs in terms of metal removal which can be directly ascribed to the decline in sulfidogenic activities of the flocculent srb both rg and rf s sulfidogenic activities continued to be tested periodically to monitor the microbial resistance to the multi metal environment the sulfidogenic activities of granular and flocculent srb were assessed by a bsp test fig 2 for the granules no significant deterioration in sulfide production was observed throughout the course of the experiment the concentration of dissolved sulfide after 80 days and 150 days of operation surpassed 300 19 mgs l in 12 h and the sulfate reduction rate reached 43 5 mgs l h after 150 days of operation the granular sludge was thus able to maintain a relatively stable level of sulfidogenic activity despite long term exposure 161 days to multiple metals in contrast in the flocculent system rf dissolved sulfide was barely detectable after day 40 data not shown and overall only 20 30 of the sulfate was reduced based on the sulfidogenic activity evaluation fig 2 consequently the metal removal profile displayed a breakpoint around 30 to 35 days fig 1 the maximum sulfide concentrations of approximately 350 mgs l in both the rg and rf systems were recorded at reactor startup the rate of sulfate utilization by srb was recorded as being proportional to the sulfide concentration and inhibition occurred when the concentration of the dissolved sulfide exceeded 200 mg l reis et al 1992 this inhibition would be temporary and reversible once the srb adapted to the new conditions higher sulfide levels 800 mg l would be attained bernardez et al 2013 sulfide inhibition was not observed in the rg even with a very high sulfide concentration of over 300 mg l for the srb flocs there is little chance that the sulfide level will have substantial impact considering the resilience of srb and the reversibility of the inhibition for sulfide concentration 460 mgs l kushkevych et al 2019 therefore it can be concluded that the various metals were the primary reason that the metabolism of the floc srb was inhibited which is further investigated below 3 2 response of srb to various metals in multi metal environment the sulfidogenic system s responses to multi metal stress were investigated in the physicochemical and biological aspects the morphology change of the srb sludge was conspicuous particularly for the granules the average particle size of the granules gradually decreased from the initial 388 18 μm to a minimum of 178 19 μm on day 120 before stabilizing at approximately 200 220 μm fig 3 a in their intact state the srb granules had a distinct regular outline a near spherical elliptical shape and a smooth porous surface after 60 days of operation under multi metal conditions the granules became irregular and brittle with additional deposits attached onto their surfaces fig 3c and figure s1 disintegration of the granules were observed after 90 days of operation which was also reflected by the higher concentration of total suspended solids in the effluent despite that the average diameter of the granules remained at 200 μm the structure began to loosen and become fragile for the flocculent sludge the average particle size increased approximately 32 from the initial 75 12 μm after addition of the various metals this can be explained by the coagulation effectiveness of the cations natural particles such as sludge and biomass are usually negatively charged the addition of multivalent cations can facilitate granulation by neutralizing the negative charge on the surface and or by suppressing the double layer by increasing the ionic strength similar strategies have been applied to promote aerobic sludge granulation li et al 2015 however enlarging the particles did not result in the formation of granular sludge in the rf fig 3b even though in theory metal sulfide can act as an inert carrier for bacteria such as poly aluminum chloride and activated carbon failed granulation on the other hand may be attributable to the biomass being inactive due to multi metal stress as the metal or metal sulfdie was concentrated in the vicinity of the srb and effectively blanketed the cells halting their activity utgikar et al 2002 by comparison while the granules had satisfactory metal removal performance within 161 days there was also evidence of process failure viz disintegration of the granules thus in practice regular sludge replacement or reducing the age of the sludge may improve operation in addition to sulfidogenic kinetics and morphology of the srb sludge cell viability was also quantitatively assessed on a periodic basis after 60 days of operation cell viability decreased from 64 to around 55 and then stabilized at approximately 50 despite the granules structure being incomplete the srb granules maintained a 51 cell viability fig 4 a in comparison the cell viability of the srb flocculent sludge dropped to 35 after 40 days in terms of metal removal the efficacy of srb granules was not impacted as seen in fig 1 for the bsc based amw treatment the respective minimum concentrations for inhibition of the individual metals i e cu2 4 64 ni2 13 59 zn2 16 5 65 and cd2 6 40 mg l is not enough indication and the synergistic effect of the mixture of metals on the srb deserves more attention especially considering that in reality wastewater is laden with various metals kaksonen and puhakka 2007 hao et al 2014 for instance a mixture of cd2 cr3 cu2 pb2 and ni2 with individual concentrations of 10 mg l clearly implicates inhibition deschatre et al 2013 in addition to the inhibitory effect from dissolved metals insoluble metal sulfides formed in the reactor can also suppress srb activities figure s1 these metal sulfides act as barriers to prevent the reactants sulfate organic matter from interacting with enzymes such as dsr and sat xie et al 2020 3 3 microbial analyses a microbial analysis was performed to determine any changes to the microbial community of the srb granular and flocculent sludge as a response to stress originating from the multi metal environment fig 5 illustrates the microbial analysis at the genus level and sequence abundance greater than 0 4 the pre cultivated srb granules contained a relative abundance of srb genera of up to 43 the srb granules were dominated by desulfobacter 18 6 desulfobulbus 18 1 desulfomicrobium 4 5 and trichococcus 12 5 after 95 days of operation the total srb genus abundance increased to 54 6 with only desulfobulbus 31 5 and desulfobacter 13 6 being dominant in terms of diversity eight of the initial nine srb genera were identified after 150 days the srb abundance decreased to around 40 and the population became increasingly unitary while the dominant bacteria in these genera are capable of only partial oxidation of organic matter this is actually desirable for metal removal as the sulfide production rate of incomplete oxidizing srb is approximately 20 higher than that of complete oxidizing srb dar et al 2008 according to the gibbs free energy values per unit sulfate reduction in table s5 thauer et al 1977 incomplete oxidation of lactate can generate twice the energy of complete oxidation 160 3 and 84 9 kj mol s respectively for the rf the abundance of the srb genera decreased from the initial 29 3 to 13 6 and 9 2 on days 35 and 120 respectively the dominant srb genera changed from desulfobacter 23 2 to desulfobulbus 4 5 to desulfosarcina 8 1 towards the end of the experiment significant reduction in the abundance of srb was responsible for the collapse of the system after a month of multi metal treatment meanwhile the removal of 50 zn2 15 ni2 and 30 cd2 and cu2 in the rf were attributable to the activities of the remaining srb and biomass adsorption enrichment of desulfosarcina from 1 6 to 8 1 can be explained by metal stimulation for example mercury and lead were found to promote desulfosarcina growth in the presence of acetate which accounted for 15 of the cod in this study in terms of cell viability around 10 and 32 drops in viability were observed in rg and rf respectively this downward trend is consistent with the microbial response for the granules the major genera anaerovorax carnobacterium and streptococcus declined in abundance for the flocculent sludge srb acidogenic bacteria e g lactococcus and prosthecochloris all decreased significantly extinction of prosthecochloris in the rf was projectable as it oxidized reduced sulfur compounds to obtain energy after approximately 40 days of operation there was no detectable dissolved sulfide 3 4 mechanism investigation into the metal resistance of the srb sludge to investigate the mechanism of multi metal resistance of srb the eps of granular and flocculent was examined periodically epss are essential for microbial life and provide a suitable environment for chemical reactions nutrient entrapment and resistance to environmental stresses from metals and toxicants a long term analysis of total eps and main eps compounds polysaccharides and proteins shows that both the rg and rf s total eps content appeared to decrease figure s2 fig 6 the protein content in rg s eps decreased to 45 4 2 mg g vss from the initial 237 14 mg g vss and remained at around 50 mg g vss throughout the rest of the experiment in contrast the polysaccharide content declined at the beginning then recovered and even increased slightly after 60 days the rf s eps protein content had a similar variation profile but the polysaccharide content experienced a drop then maintained the pattern shown in fig 6c d the protein content changed more drastically in comparison to the polysaccharides content with 30 days of multi metal impact approximately 80 of the protein was lost in both rg and rf the proteins in the eps are believed to be responsible for forming complexes with the metals rizvi et al 2019 xie et al 2020 have reported that the adsorption capacity of deproteinized eps to cd2 decreased by 70 3 compared with crude eps the watershed of sulfidogenic activity occurred at around day 35 in the rf whereas no decline in performance of heavy metal removal was observed in the rg the major difference between these two sludges lies within the polysaccharide content of their eps granular activity was maintained after polysaccharide production was restored it can be deduced that the polysaccharides triggered the organisms adaptive mechanism the cells could form a shield of polysaccharides to protect themselves from being penetrated by the toxic metal ions as polysaccharides contain functional groups such as hydroxyl carbonyl carboxyl and sulfhydryl which have a natural affinity for metals such as cd2 and cu2 derco and vrana 2018 when bulk conditions such as concentration and ph change the absorbed metals can be released the reversible process can create a one of a kind mechanism for microgram protection yuan et al 2010 to further reveal the polysaccharide based microbial response to multi metal stress the glycosyl composition of the eps was examined table 2 summarizes the glycosyl composition of the eps from the granular and flocculent sludge glucose had the highest molar percentage 27 5 in the granules followed by galactose 19 2 and rhamnose 16 1 galactose 42 7 was the most abundant carbohydrate in the flocculent whereas rhamnose and xylose were not detected the production of xylose may serve as a marker for the maturation of the granules or biofilms as it is only produced in the stationary phase irie et al 2006 the study performed md simulations to qualitatively illustrate the interactions between the glycosyls and the metals involved figure s3 a mean square displacement msd analysis showed that the metals had stronger mobility in the rf than in the rg system fig 7 a more specifically in the granular system the diffusion coefficients dcs of cu2 and ni2 were 51 5 and 62 of those in the flocculent system respectively while the dc differences of zn2 and cd2 in these two systems were relatively minor fig 7b the suppression of the metals diffusion can be ascribed to the varied glycosyl compositions in these two systems xylose and rhamnose were detected only in rg table 2 the interactions between xylose rhamnose and the metals were analyzed by the radial distribution functions rdf which showed that ni2 could form complexes with rhamnose and cu2 with both xylose and rhamnose fig 8 but the same was not observed between zn2 and cd2 and the two glycosyls other glycosyls such as heptose mannose galactose and glucose also did not show any complexation tendencies with the metals therefore the diffusions of cu2 and ni2 were greatly suppressed in the rg the binding strength between the metal ions and the glycosyl can be attributed to electrostatic interaction energy fig 9 all of the identified glycosyls exhibited stronger interactions with cu2 than the other three metals as indicated by the significant decrease in interaction energy particularly for heptose which had an interaction energy of 470 kj mol 1 in comparison only rhamnose served as the ligand for ni2 immobilization and the zn2 and cd2 had a weaker binding to all of the glycosyls examined in this study for zn2 and cd2 resistance in the sufldogenic system extracellular precipitation viz metal sulfide is recognized as the major mechanism muyzer and stams 2008 which is also supported by the visual minteq thermodynamic calculation performed in this study table s4 nevertheless the contribution or role of the living cell surface and intracellular adsorption should also be investigated mannose exhibited the greatest potential for complexation with cd2 thus induced production of mannose via substrate modification may provide a means for increasing the bacteria s resilience when treating cd2 laden wastewater extracellular carbohydrates appear naturally in polysaccharide form through glycosidic linkage of glycosyl compositions the physicochemical properties of the polysaccharides depend on individual structures e g linear or breached however the characteristics of the glycosyl composition can also be maintained in most cases of linkage lo et al 2011 udayan et al 2017 therefore the md simulation by investigating interactions between glycosyls and metal ions is reasonable to elucidate the adaptive mechanisms of srb in the present study in summary proteins from eps were the microorganisms first defense against stress from the multi metal environment but this mechanism has seemed to be irreversible if conditions prove to be too harmful on the other hand in the longer run the glycosyl content of the eps played a critical role in maintaining the microbial structure and stability thereby acting as an alternative defense mechanism for the microorganisms 3 5 implementation potential the study has found that treating sulfuric metal laden industrial wastewater with srb granules demonstrates not only high efficiency but also long term stability in comparison with floc srb the primary benefits of bsc based technologies for treatment of amw over other methods are low operating costs and scalability to a large scale the sulfide production rate of rg was maintained at greater than 1 0 g s l day throughout the experiment based on the sulfidogenic activity evaluation which is compatible with those previously reported i e 0 10 to 2 10 g s l day sun et al 2020 for the bsc process the electron donor viz carbon source is the driving force which is generally insufficient in amw extra carbon source addition is thus the major cost of the bsc process this cost ranges from 0 01 to 0 06 usd per mole of sulfide production which is about 30 60 of the average cost of chemical addition e g na2s sun et al 2020 nevertheless some observable downsides to the bsc process cannot be ignored the eventual disintegration of the granular structure the simplification of the microbial community after approximately three months of trial and the remedy for which may be to replace the granules on a periodic basis metal rich waste sludge granules or flocs must be disposed of in a safe and economical manner even though metal recovery from waste sludge is an inevitable trend metal recovery in particular requires reactor designs and process conditions that are different from those usually used for sulfate reduction considering the mechanisms of electrokinetic migration electrodialysis and electrocoagulation electrochemical reactors can be an option for metal separation and recovery rodrigues and leão 2020 regardless of whether metal recovery is performed it is essential to stabilize and inertly dispose of sludge through solidification incineration or landfill in order to prevent secondary environmental contamination 4 conclusion this study has examined the performance and adaptive mechanisms of granular and flocculent sulfate reducing sludge for the treatment of amw in terms of metal removal granular srb proved to have better performance than flocs over the long term however even though the sulfate reduction rate was maintained 40 mg s l h over the course of operation the srb granules cell viability decreased from 60 to around 50 after 60 days and the granules were observed to disintegrate after 90 days in addition the srb community became dominated by genera that only partially oxidized organics desulfobulbus and desulfobacter to adapt to the environmental stress the microorganisms mechanism was to first consume proteins from the eps and neither re secretion nor accumulation was reached later based on the molecular dynamic simulations the glycosyls in the eps were critical for maintaining the microbial and granular structures after the proteins in the eps had been exhausted the adaptive mechanisms of srb granules not only offer an alternative for the effective treatment of amw but may also expand the application of bsc technologies declaration of competing

15332,dissimilatory sulfate reduction based processes have long been a viable option for treating acidic metal laden wastewater amw such processes can be optimized through enhancing sulfidogenic activity and the microbial consortia s resilience against a harsh environment this study investigated how granular and flocculent sulfate reducing bacteria srb sludge respond to amw as well as the mechanisms through which they adapt to the wastewater with particular focuses on the stability of the sulfidogenic activities metal removal and the bacteria s resistance over the long term the flocculent srb lost more than 50 of their treatment capacity after 35 days of treating amw with the presence of cd2 cu2 zn2 and ni2 at 30 mg l each under ph 4 5 in contrast the granular srb maintained its metal removal rate at 91 throughout the 161 day trial despite the srb abundance remaining at approximate 40 organics partial oxidizing genera desulfobulbus and desulfobacter began to dominate due to their kinetic advantage the extracellular glycosyl compositions were revealed to be critical for the stability of the granular structure and microbial activity as the extracellular proteins disintegrated irreversible usage the molecular dynamic simulation the mobility of the metal ions in the srb granular system was suppressed by the presence of a more diverse glycosyl composition compared with the flocculent system 10 50 diffusion coefficients differences all of the identified glycosyls especially xylose and rhamnose exhibited strong interactions with cu2 470 kj mol 1 while the maximum binding strength of cd2 to glycosyls was greater than 40 kj mol 1 suggesting a low cd2 complexation efficiency the findings of this study shed light on the defensive mechanisms of srb granules against multi metal stress and provide clues for efficient amw treatment keywords sulfate reduction granular sludge metal removal sulfate reducing bacteria data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sulfuric metal laden wastewater from such industries as leather tanning kraft pulping and acid mine drainage contains high acidity and high toxic metal content and causes some of the most severe pollution of water and soil across the world kefeni et al 2017 naidu et al 2019 in view of hydrogen sulfide s ability to facilitate in situ metal precipitation via dissimilatory sulfate reduction while also producing alkalinity to neutralize acidic water sulfate reducing bacteria srb mediated biological sulfur conversion bsc has long been considered the primary option for treating acidic metal laden wastewater amw ayangbenro et al 2018 sun et al 2020 srb can survive in a wide variety of environments temperatures ranging from 0 to 100 ºc salinities ranging from freshwater to halite saturated solutions and ph ranging from 3 to 9 8 mackenzie 2005 bsc based treatments are therefore expected to be highly applicable to a variety of industrial wastewater furthermore approximately 0 32 to 0 41 usd m3 was estimated to cover capital operation and maintenance costs for bsc technologies over a 10 to 30 year duration making it nearly the most cost effective method for simultaneously removing sulfate and metals kempton et al 2003 bio fgd and thioteq metal are two recently developed bsc technologies for wet flue gas desulfurization wastewater treatment and metal recovery from acid mine drainage respectively and their practicability and cost effectiveness are widely acknowledged in the industry chen et al 2020 das et al 2022 weijma et al 2022 for such bsc based processes to be effective a high level of sulfidogenic activity as well as a high sludge concentration should be maintained however srb s low sludge yield 0 02 kg vss kg cod chemical oxygen demand and sensitivity to the growth environment e g toxic metals ph temperature cod s ratio undermine its overall practicality and applicability hao et al 2015 abo elsoud and abo alkasem 2022 considering that granular sludge has collective defense against environmental stresses high treatment efficiency and can be easily separated from the effluent srb granules have been developed for sulfate laden municipal wastewater treatment in our previous study hao et al 2013 the granulation was able to attain a sludge concentration of 22 g l with 44 srb abundance desulfobulbus desulfobacter and desulfomicrobium being the predominant genera and an average granule diameter of 420 142 μm hao et al 2013 the organic loading rate for that particular granular system reached 13 3 kg cod m3 day typical loading of 2 0 3 5 kg cod m3 day and the sulfate reduction rate even reached 503 mg s l h or 6 times the typical value for flocculent sludge systems tsui et al 2016 qi et al 2022 such performance has given us the confidence to expect that srb granular sludge has the potential and reliability for a broader range of wastewater treatment applications and a better chance of surviving harsh environments than flocculent sludge this confidence in granules superiority in treating amw however needs to be confirmed through examining and comparing the performance in greater detail over the longer term as there are aspects where granular sludge does not show clear cut superiority over flocculent sludge for instance regardless of reactor scale and influent substrate for both granular and flocculent sludge desulfovibrio desulfobulbus desulfomicrobium and desulfobacter are the most dominant srb genera inside the reactor in other words microbial analysis alone does not verify the superior performance of the srb granules hao et al 2014 kosugi et al 2022 besides extracellular polymeric substances eps which are the microorganisms protective and active slime inside both granular and flocculent sludge have been found to keep steady within a similar range 90 200 mg g vss sahinkaya et al 2018 what the above has indicated is that there are fundamental issues to be addressed before granular sludge based amw treatment can be promulgated these issues can be summarized as one whether or not srb granules can survive an acidic multi metal environment i e the simultaneous presence of cd2 cu2 zn2 and ni2 and still keep up their sulfidogenic activities over an extended period of time two how the granules microorganism consortia will respond to metal stress and three what are their defense mechanisms against such stress this study therefore applies both flocculent and granular srb sludge to treat amw in a long term operation to examine and compare their performance the evaluations are done in terms of metal removal sulfidogenic activities changes in microbial communities and the physicochemical and biological characteristics of the srb the adaptive response mechanisms of the granular and flocculent consortia to the stress presented by the acidic metallic environment are further investigated using molecular dynamic simulation the findings of this study provide first hand information on the potential and reliability of using srb granules to treat sulfuric metal laden industrial wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup and operation the experiments were conducted in two continuous polyvinyl chloride pvc reactors with identical height 600 mm internal diameter 60 mm and working volume 1 5 l for the granular sludge reactor hereafter rg the volume of granular srb sludge was 1 0 l 12 4 1 7 g vss l which had been seeded from a pre cultured sulfate reducing reactor the resulting initial concentration of volatile suspended solids vss was therefore 8 0 0 56 g l for the flocculent sludge reactor hereafter rf the inoculum was obtained from a sulfate reduction reactor treating saline domestic wastewater obtained from sha tin sewage treatment works in hong kong with sludge concentration in terms of vss identical with rg details of the inoculum operating conditions of the reactors and influent substrates are provided in tables s1 and s2 supplementary information and table 1 respectively the wastewater used in the study was synthesized as per our previous research hao et al 2013 and glucose and acetate were used as the sources of organic carbon glucose acetate 4 1 while sulfate was added at a concentration of 500 mgs l to tune the cod sulfate ratio to the desired 2 the ph of the content was adjusted to 4 5 using 1 m hcl cucl2 2h2o zncl2 nicl2 h2o and cd no3 2 were used to prepare metal stock solutions at concentrations of 1 g l jong and parry 2003 which were then added to the influent according to the desired concentrations of the individual metals ni2 cu2 cd2 zn2 table 1 to avoid contamination and putrefaction fresh influent was prepared every 12 h and fed continuously into the reactor via its bottom inlet 2 2 sulfidogenic activity the sulfidogenic activities of the granules and flocs were determined via the biochemical sulfide potential bsp test chen et al 2018 the inocula for which were obtained periodically from the rg and rf the batch reactors were designed to have a sludge concentration of 5000 mgvss l and received the same influent as rg and rf but without the addition of metals to shorten the duration of the test the influent was diluted twice using cod at 1500 mg l and sulfate at 250 mgs l nitrogen gas was used to flush the headspace in the reactors for 15 min prior to each batch cycle to ensure anoxic conditions liquid samples were drawn periodically to analyze the sulfate and sulfide contents as well as ph 2 3 analytical methods liquid samples were collected periodically to determine the metal removal and sulfide production efficiencies of the rg and rf the sulfate concentration was determined using an ion chromatogram hic20a super shimadzu corporation equipped with an ic sa2 analytical column and a conductivity detector the concentration of dissolved sulfide was determined using the methylene blue method eaton et al 2005 the concentrations of the dissolved ions of the metals ni2 cu2 cd2 zn2 were determined using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer optima 5300 dv perkin elmer instruments usa the vss of the inocula was determined using standard methods eaton et al 2005 eps were extracted from the flocs and granules using formaldehyde naoh liu and fang 2002 the content of polysaccharides was determined using the gaudy 1962 anthrone method with glucose as the standard and the protein content was determined using a modified lowry colorimetric method with bovine serum albumin as the standard dc protein assay biorad to determine the glycosyl composition methyl glycosides were prepared from a dry sample via methanolysis with 1 m hcl in methanol at 80 c for 18 to 22 h followed by re n acetylation with pyridine and acetic anhydride in methanol merkle and poppe 1994 the samples were then per o trimethylsilylated for 30 min at 80 c using the pierce tri sil reagent the tms methyl glycosides were examined by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms gcms tq8050 nx shimadzu japan monosaccharides were identified by comparing their retention times to the standards cell viability was determined using the cell permeable nucleic acid dye syto 9 and propidium iodide pi live dead baclighttm bacterial viability kit molecular probes inc according to the manufacturer s instructions the details of which can be found in hao et al 2016 images of the samples were procured using a confocal laser scanning microscope clsm lsm duo7 carl zeiss and analyzed using the imagej software suite national institute of health usa from each sample more than thirty images were taken from randomly selected areas and the presence of live and dead microorganisms was quantified via the relative abundance of green live and red dead pixels 2 4 microbial community and proteomic analysis three samples each were collected from the rg and the rf one at the beginning one at the middle and the other at the end of the experiment to analyze the microbial communities in terms of total 16s rrna gene content via illumina miseq the illumina sequencing was provided by sangon biotech shanghai co ltd the procedures for the dna extraction pcr amplification pyrosequencing and data analysis are detailed in section a of the supplementary information si 2 5 modeling and simulation the main metal resistance mechanism by eps is the formation and sequestration of heavy metals in complexes teitzel and parsek 2003 gupta and diwan 2017 to gain insight into this interaction between the eps and the metal ions molecular dynamics md simulations were performed with the gromacs package version 2018 8 the initial configuration was constructed by uniformly mixing pre determined glycosyl compositions and metal ions in a 6 6 6 nm3 container the concentrations of the components were consistent with the experimental data any excess positive charge was neutralized by cl anions the details are given in table s3 the glycosyl and metal ions were modelled by the gromos54a7 force field schmid et al 2011 the lennard jones lj parameters for ni2 and cd2 were adopted lennard jones 1931 water molecules were characterized using the spc e model berendsen et al 1987 hoffmann et al 1999 de araujo et al 2007 van der waals vdw was calculated in terms of lj potential and electrostatic forces were computed via the particle mesh ewald method with a cutoff of 1 2 nm darden et al 1993 the initial configurations were energy minimized using a steepest descent algorithm followed by a 200 ps equilibration at 298 k and 1 bar then 50 ns md runs were carried out under the npt constant pressure and temperature ensemble at the same temperature and pressure which were respectively controlled by a nosé hoover thermostat hoover 1985 and a parrinello rahman barostat nosé 1984 the leapfrog algorithm was applied to integrate the equations of motion with a time step of 1 fs three dimensional periodic boundary conditions were applied to the simulation systems 3 results and discussion 3 1 metal removal efficiency and sulfidogenic activity fig 1 illustrates the long term performances 161 days of the rg and rf s metal removal as this study is primarily concerned with metal removal and sulfidogenic activity sufficient cod was supplied to ensure that sulfidogensis indeed occurred throughout the course of the experiment the granular sulfidogenic system rg exhibited more stable and efficient metal removal than rf the average concentrations of cd2 cu2 zn2 and ni2 in the effluent were 4 1 0 97 0 4 0 18 1 1 0 46 and 1 3 0 70 mg l respectively in other words the removal efficiencies for all these metals were greater than 90 however the cd2 cu2 and ni2 concentrations in the rf effluent reached approximately 15 20 mg l after about 35 days of operation decreasing the metal removal efficiency from the initial 80 to 32 which is for the most part attributable to insufficient sulfide production as metal sulfide precipitation was the main mechanism of metal removal ni2 was the first metal to break through the rf column reactor and it reached about 14 3 mg l on day 37 with a 50 removal efficiency decreasing to 32 by day 121 in a biological process metals can be removed through 1 adsorption including chemical adsorption onto an organic substrate and biosorption onto microorganisms and 2 chemical precipitation i e sulfide hydroxide li and yu 2014 it is generally believed that adsorption chemical and through microorganisms contributes 5 of metal removal and the adsorbed metals can be released if the bulk liquid undergoes changes in its conditions ph concentration and temperature qian et al 2016 the precipitation potential of metal sulfides in the sulfidogensis systems i e rg and rf was evaluated using visual minteq based on thermodynamic calculations table s4 once the sulfide concentration exceeded 100 mgs l more than 88 of the metals could be precipitated the srb granules outperformed the flocs in terms of metal removal which can be directly ascribed to the decline in sulfidogenic activities of the flocculent srb both rg and rf s sulfidogenic activities continued to be tested periodically to monitor the microbial resistance to the multi metal environment the sulfidogenic activities of granular and flocculent srb were assessed by a bsp test fig 2 for the granules no significant deterioration in sulfide production was observed throughout the course of the experiment the concentration of dissolved sulfide after 80 days and 150 days of operation surpassed 300 19 mgs l in 12 h and the sulfate reduction rate reached 43 5 mgs l h after 150 days of operation the granular sludge was thus able to maintain a relatively stable level of sulfidogenic activity despite long term exposure 161 days to multiple metals in contrast in the flocculent system rf dissolved sulfide was barely detectable after day 40 data not shown and overall only 20 30 of the sulfate was reduced based on the sulfidogenic activity evaluation fig 2 consequently the metal removal profile displayed a breakpoint around 30 to 35 days fig 1 the maximum sulfide concentrations of approximately 350 mgs l in both the rg and rf systems were recorded at reactor startup the rate of sulfate utilization by srb was recorded as being proportional to the sulfide concentration and inhibition occurred when the concentration of the dissolved sulfide exceeded 200 mg l reis et al 1992 this inhibition would be temporary and reversible once the srb adapted to the new conditions higher sulfide levels 800 mg l would be attained bernardez et al 2013 sulfide inhibition was not observed in the rg even with a very high sulfide concentration of over 300 mg l for the srb flocs there is little chance that the sulfide level will have substantial impact considering the resilience of srb and the reversibility of the inhibition for sulfide concentration 460 mgs l kushkevych et al 2019 therefore it can be concluded that the various metals were the primary reason that the metabolism of the floc srb was inhibited which is further investigated below 3 2 response of srb to various metals in multi metal environment the sulfidogenic system s responses to multi metal stress were investigated in the physicochemical and biological aspects the morphology change of the srb sludge was conspicuous particularly for the granules the average particle size of the granules gradually decreased from the initial 388 18 μm to a minimum of 178 19 μm on day 120 before stabilizing at approximately 200 220 μm fig 3 a in their intact state the srb granules had a distinct regular outline a near spherical elliptical shape and a smooth porous surface after 60 days of operation under multi metal conditions the granules became irregular and brittle with additional deposits attached onto their surfaces fig 3c and figure s1 disintegration of the granules were observed after 90 days of operation which was also reflected by the higher concentration of total suspended solids in the effluent despite that the average diameter of the granules remained at 200 μm the structure began to loosen and become fragile for the flocculent sludge the average particle size increased approximately 32 from the initial 75 12 μm after addition of the various metals this can be explained by the coagulation effectiveness of the cations natural particles such as sludge and biomass are usually negatively charged the addition of multivalent cations can facilitate granulation by neutralizing the negative charge on the surface and or by suppressing the double layer by increasing the ionic strength similar strategies have been applied to promote aerobic sludge granulation li et al 2015 however enlarging the particles did not result in the formation of granular sludge in the rf fig 3b even though in theory metal sulfide can act as an inert carrier for bacteria such as poly aluminum chloride and activated carbon failed granulation on the other hand may be attributable to the biomass being inactive due to multi metal stress as the metal or metal sulfdie was concentrated in the vicinity of the srb and effectively blanketed the cells halting their activity utgikar et al 2002 by comparison while the granules had satisfactory metal removal performance within 161 days there was also evidence of process failure viz disintegration of the granules thus in practice regular sludge replacement or reducing the age of the sludge may improve operation in addition to sulfidogenic kinetics and morphology of the srb sludge cell viability was also quantitatively assessed on a periodic basis after 60 days of operation cell viability decreased from 64 to around 55 and then stabilized at approximately 50 despite the granules structure being incomplete the srb granules maintained a 51 cell viability fig 4 a in comparison the cell viability of the srb flocculent sludge dropped to 35 after 40 days in terms of metal removal the efficacy of srb granules was not impacted as seen in fig 1 for the bsc based amw treatment the respective minimum concentrations for inhibition of the individual metals i e cu2 4 64 ni2 13 59 zn2 16 5 65 and cd2 6 40 mg l is not enough indication and the synergistic effect of the mixture of metals on the srb deserves more attention especially considering that in reality wastewater is laden with various metals kaksonen and puhakka 2007 hao et al 2014 for instance a mixture of cd2 cr3 cu2 pb2 and ni2 with individual concentrations of 10 mg l clearly implicates inhibition deschatre et al 2013 in addition to the inhibitory effect from dissolved metals insoluble metal sulfides formed in the reactor can also suppress srb activities figure s1 these metal sulfides act as barriers to prevent the reactants sulfate organic matter from interacting with enzymes such as dsr and sat xie et al 2020 3 3 microbial analyses a microbial analysis was performed to determine any changes to the microbial community of the srb granular and flocculent sludge as a response to stress originating from the multi metal environment fig 5 illustrates the microbial analysis at the genus level and sequence abundance greater than 0 4 the pre cultivated srb granules contained a relative abundance of srb genera of up to 43 the srb granules were dominated by desulfobacter 18 6 desulfobulbus 18 1 desulfomicrobium 4 5 and trichococcus 12 5 after 95 days of operation the total srb genus abundance increased to 54 6 with only desulfobulbus 31 5 and desulfobacter 13 6 being dominant in terms of diversity eight of the initial nine srb genera were identified after 150 days the srb abundance decreased to around 40 and the population became increasingly unitary while the dominant bacteria in these genera are capable of only partial oxidation of organic matter this is actually desirable for metal removal as the sulfide production rate of incomplete oxidizing srb is approximately 20 higher than that of complete oxidizing srb dar et al 2008 according to the gibbs free energy values per unit sulfate reduction in table s5 thauer et al 1977 incomplete oxidation of lactate can generate twice the energy of complete oxidation 160 3 and 84 9 kj mol s respectively for the rf the abundance of the srb genera decreased from the initial 29 3 to 13 6 and 9 2 on days 35 and 120 respectively the dominant srb genera changed from desulfobacter 23 2 to desulfobulbus 4 5 to desulfosarcina 8 1 towards the end of the experiment significant reduction in the abundance of srb was responsible for the collapse of the system after a month of multi metal treatment meanwhile the removal of 50 zn2 15 ni2 and 30 cd2 and cu2 in the rf were attributable to the activities of the remaining srb and biomass adsorption enrichment of desulfosarcina from 1 6 to 8 1 can be explained by metal stimulation for example mercury and lead were found to promote desulfosarcina growth in the presence of acetate which accounted for 15 of the cod in this study in terms of cell viability around 10 and 32 drops in viability were observed in rg and rf respectively this downward trend is consistent with the microbial response for the granules the major genera anaerovorax carnobacterium and streptococcus declined in abundance for the flocculent sludge srb acidogenic bacteria e g lactococcus and prosthecochloris all decreased significantly extinction of prosthecochloris in the rf was projectable as it oxidized reduced sulfur compounds to obtain energy after approximately 40 days of operation there was no detectable dissolved sulfide 3 4 mechanism investigation into the metal resistance of the srb sludge to investigate the mechanism of multi metal resistance of srb the eps of granular and flocculent was examined periodically epss are essential for microbial life and provide a suitable environment for chemical reactions nutrient entrapment and resistance to environmental stresses from metals and toxicants a long term analysis of total eps and main eps compounds polysaccharides and proteins shows that both the rg and rf s total eps content appeared to decrease figure s2 fig 6 the protein content in rg s eps decreased to 45 4 2 mg g vss from the initial 237 14 mg g vss and remained at around 50 mg g vss throughout the rest of the experiment in contrast the polysaccharide content declined at the beginning then recovered and even increased slightly after 60 days the rf s eps protein content had a similar variation profile but the polysaccharide content experienced a drop then maintained the pattern shown in fig 6c d the protein content changed more drastically in comparison to the polysaccharides content with 30 days of multi metal impact approximately 80 of the protein was lost in both rg and rf the proteins in the eps are believed to be responsible for forming complexes with the metals rizvi et al 2019 xie et al 2020 have reported that the adsorption capacity of deproteinized eps to cd2 decreased by 70 3 compared with crude eps the watershed of sulfidogenic activity occurred at around day 35 in the rf whereas no decline in performance of heavy metal removal was observed in the rg the major difference between these two sludges lies within the polysaccharide content of their eps granular activity was maintained after polysaccharide production was restored it can be deduced that the polysaccharides triggered the organisms adaptive mechanism the cells could form a shield of polysaccharides to protect themselves from being penetrated by the toxic metal ions as polysaccharides contain functional groups such as hydroxyl carbonyl carboxyl and sulfhydryl which have a natural affinity for metals such as cd2 and cu2 derco and vrana 2018 when bulk conditions such as concentration and ph change the absorbed metals can be released the reversible process can create a one of a kind mechanism for microgram protection yuan et al 2010 to further reveal the polysaccharide based microbial response to multi metal stress the glycosyl composition of the eps was examined table 2 summarizes the glycosyl composition of the eps from the granular and flocculent sludge glucose had the highest molar percentage 27 5 in the granules followed by galactose 19 2 and rhamnose 16 1 galactose 42 7 was the most abundant carbohydrate in the flocculent whereas rhamnose and xylose were not detected the production of xylose may serve as a marker for the maturation of the granules or biofilms as it is only produced in the stationary phase irie et al 2006 the study performed md simulations to qualitatively illustrate the interactions between the glycosyls and the metals involved figure s3 a mean square displacement msd analysis showed that the metals had stronger mobility in the rf than in the rg system fig 7 a more specifically in the granular system the diffusion coefficients dcs of cu2 and ni2 were 51 5 and 62 of those in the flocculent system respectively while the dc differences of zn2 and cd2 in these two systems were relatively minor fig 7b the suppression of the metals diffusion can be ascribed to the varied glycosyl compositions in these two systems xylose and rhamnose were detected only in rg table 2 the interactions between xylose rhamnose and the metals were analyzed by the radial distribution functions rdf which showed that ni2 could form complexes with rhamnose and cu2 with both xylose and rhamnose fig 8 but the same was not observed between zn2 and cd2 and the two glycosyls other glycosyls such as heptose mannose galactose and glucose also did not show any complexation tendencies with the metals therefore the diffusions of cu2 and ni2 were greatly suppressed in the rg the binding strength between the metal ions and the glycosyl can be attributed to electrostatic interaction energy fig 9 all of the identified glycosyls exhibited stronger interactions with cu2 than the other three metals as indicated by the significant decrease in interaction energy particularly for heptose which had an interaction energy of 470 kj mol 1 in comparison only rhamnose served as the ligand for ni2 immobilization and the zn2 and cd2 had a weaker binding to all of the glycosyls examined in this study for zn2 and cd2 resistance in the sufldogenic system extracellular precipitation viz metal sulfide is recognized as the major mechanism muyzer and stams 2008 which is also supported by the visual minteq thermodynamic calculation performed in this study table s4 nevertheless the contribution or role of the living cell surface and intracellular adsorption should also be investigated mannose exhibited the greatest potential for complexation with cd2 thus induced production of mannose via substrate modification may provide a means for increasing the bacteria s resilience when treating cd2 laden wastewater extracellular carbohydrates appear naturally in polysaccharide form through glycosidic linkage of glycosyl compositions the physicochemical properties of the polysaccharides depend on individual structures e g linear or breached however the characteristics of the glycosyl composition can also be maintained in most cases of linkage lo et al 2011 udayan et al 2017 therefore the md simulation by investigating interactions between glycosyls and metal ions is reasonable to elucidate the adaptive mechanisms of srb in the present study in summary proteins from eps were the microorganisms first defense against stress from the multi metal environment but this mechanism has seemed to be irreversible if conditions prove to be too harmful on the other hand in the longer run the glycosyl content of the eps played a critical role in maintaining the microbial structure and stability thereby acting as an alternative defense mechanism for the microorganisms 3 5 implementation potential the study has found that treating sulfuric metal laden industrial wastewater with srb granules demonstrates not only high efficiency but also long term stability in comparison with floc srb the primary benefits of bsc based technologies for treatment of amw over other methods are low operating costs and scalability to a large scale the sulfide production rate of rg was maintained at greater than 1 0 g s l day throughout the experiment based on the sulfidogenic activity evaluation which is compatible with those previously reported i e 0 10 to 2 10 g s l day sun et al 2020 for the bsc process the electron donor viz carbon source is the driving force which is generally insufficient in amw extra carbon source addition is thus the major cost of the bsc process this cost ranges from 0 01 to 0 06 usd per mole of sulfide production which is about 30 60 of the average cost of chemical addition e g na2s sun et al 2020 nevertheless some observable downsides to the bsc process cannot be ignored the eventual disintegration of the granular structure the simplification of the microbial community after approximately three months of trial and the remedy for which may be to replace the granules on a periodic basis metal rich waste sludge granules or flocs must be disposed of in a safe and economical manner even though metal recovery from waste sludge is an inevitable trend metal recovery in particular requires reactor designs and process conditions that are different from those usually used for sulfate reduction considering the mechanisms of electrokinetic migration electrodialysis and electrocoagulation electrochemical reactors can be an option for metal separation and recovery rodrigues and leão 2020 regardless of whether metal recovery is performed it is essential to stabilize and inertly dispose of sludge through solidification incineration or landfill in order to prevent secondary environmental contamination 4 conclusion this study has examined the performance and adaptive mechanisms of granular and flocculent sulfate reducing sludge for the treatment of amw in terms of metal removal granular srb proved to have better performance than flocs over the long term however even though the sulfate reduction rate was maintained 40 mg s l h over the course of operation the srb granules cell viability decreased from 60 to around 50 after 60 days and the granules were observed to disintegrate after 90 days in addition the srb community became dominated by genera that only partially oxidized organics desulfobulbus and desulfobacter to adapt to the environmental stress the microorganisms mechanism was to first consume proteins from the eps and neither re secretion nor accumulation was reached later based on the molecular dynamic simulations the glycosyls in the eps were critical for maintaining the microbial and granular structures after the proteins in the eps had been exhausted the adaptive mechanisms of srb granules not only offer an alternative for the effective treatment of amw but may also expand the application of bsc technologies declaration of competing

15333,widespread contamination of groundwater with per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas has required drinking water producers to quickly adopt practical and efficacious treatments to limit human exposure and deleterious health outcomes this pilot scale study comparatively investigated pfas adsorption behaviors in granular activated carbon gac and two strong base gel anion exchange resin aer columns operated in parallel over a 441 day period to treat contaminated groundwater dominated by short chain perfluorocarboxylic acids pfca highly resolved breakthrough profiles of homologous series of 2 8 cf2 pfca and perfluorosulfonic acids pfsa including ultrashort chain compounds and branched isomers were measured to elucidate adsorption trends sample ports at intermediate bed depths could predict 50 breakthrough of compounds on an accelerated basis but lower empty bed contact times led to conservative estimates of initial breakthrough homologous pfas series displayed linear gac and log linear aer relationships between chain length and breakthrough independent of initial concentration aers generally outperformed gac on a normalized bed volume basis and this advantage widened with increasing pfas chain length as designed all treatments would have short full scale service times 142 days for gac 61 days for aers before initial breakthrough of short chain 2 4 cf2 pfca however aer displayed far longer breakthrough times for pfsa compared to gac 3 treatment time and breakthrough was not observed for pfsa with 4 cf2 in aers gac had a finite molar adsorption capacity for total pfas leading to a stoichiometric replacement of short chain pfca by pfsa and longer chain pfca over time aers quickly reached a finite adsorption capacity for pfca but they showed substantially greater selectivity for pfsa whose capacity was not reached within the duration of the pilot breakthrough characteristics of keto and unsaturated pfsa identified in the groundwater by suspect screening were also evaluated in absence of reference standards modified pfas structures branched keto unsaturated broke through faster than linear and unmodified perfluorinated structures with equal degrees of fluorination and the effects were more pronounced in gac compared to aers the results highlight that the design of robust pfas treatment systems should consider facets beyond current pfas targets including operational complexities and impacts of unregulated and unmonitored co contaminants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords drinking water treatment per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas ion exchange granular activated carbon adsorption data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas are a wide ranging group of persistent fluorine substituted organic chemicals of worldwide environmental health concern widespread pfas detection in drinking water sources has prompted utilities to implement treatments to meet increasingly stringent health guidelines and regulations european union 2020 u s epa 2022 current drinking water regulatory guidelines emphasize treatment of legacy medium to long chain pfas 6 cf2 such as pfhxs pfoa and pfos hu et al 2016 massachusetts department of environmental protection 2020 however a shift in production and regulatory scrutiny to short chain compounds such as pfba pfbs and genx brendel et al 2018 u s epa 2022 has necessitated treatment consideration of these less hydrophobic substitutes pfas particularly persistent anionic perfluoroalkyl acids pfaa are not effectively removed in conventional water treatment processes due to their solubility and the recalcitrance of carbon fluorine bonds appleman et al 2014 rahman et al 2014 however advanced physical chemical separation processes including adsorption and high pressure membranes e g reverse osmosis and nanofiltration have demonstrated efficacious pfas removal under a variety of source water conditions appleman et al 2014 boyer et al 2021 liu et al 2021 adsorptive processes are particularly appealing water treatment options due to their low pressure operating conditions lack of concentrated aqueous waste streams and potential for future regeneration and reuse franke et al 2021 zaggia et al 2016 adsorptive media such as granular activated carbon gac and anion exchange resins aers remove pfas through a combination of electrostatic interactions with charged headgroups and non electrostatic interactions with hydrophobic fluorinated tail groups du et al 2014 gac adsorption can be primarily attributed to attraction to hydrophobic pore surfaces with secondary electrostatic attraction or repulsion depending on the net surface charge of the gac park et al 2020b aer adsorption is based on a combination of selective ion exchange interactions with cationic resin functional groups and hydrophobic interactions with the resin boyer et al 2021 zaggia et al 2016 despite widespread implementation of gac treatment for a variety of micropollutants interest in aers has grown specifically for pfas due to their high capacity and selectivity particularly towards perfluorosulfonic acids pfsa and longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids pfca franke et al 2021 mccleaf et al 2017 murray et al 2021 additionally aer treatments can be designed with shorter empty bed contact times ebct 1 5 3 mins and vessel footprints compared to gac 8 13 min murray et al 2021 purolite 2021 because of the influence of hydrophobic interactions both gac and aer exhibit higher efficacy treating long chain pfas compared to more hydrophilic short chain homologs appleman et al 2014 mccleaf et al 2017 these technologies have not been comprehensively compared for treatment of groundwater dominated by shorter chain pfca pilot scale adsorptive treatability studies are crucial to evaluate the efficacy of different treatment technologies under site specific water matrix characteristics pfas contaminant profiles and treatment goals continuous flow pfas treatment studies to date have been primarily limited to targeted pfaa particularly water with substantial fractions of long chain pfsa boyer et al 2021 gagliano et al 2020 co occurrence of dozens of additional pfas classes have been revealed by suspect screening of contaminated groundwater barzen hanson et al 2017 nickerson et al 2020 however they are rarely evaluated for treatability once identified liu and sun 2021 wang et al 2020 furthermore treatability of co occurring ultrashort chain 2 3 cf2 and branched pfaa isomers in groundwater are not often considered neuwald et al 2022 rahman et al 2014 obscuring a more complete understanding of competitive pfas adsorption behaviors considering the time and cost required to operate pilot scale treatment studies it is important to maximize the analytical value of each tested system to develop a more comprehensive understanding of long term adsorption behavior in complex pfas mixtures this study provides a comparative characterization of pfas adsorption behaviors onto gac and aers based on a 15 month pilot scale treatment of contaminated groundwater using highly resolved multi port breakthrough data systematic treatability trends were elucidated for each adsorbent type based on pfas chain length head group functionality and branching tail structure new insights into competitive adsorption were determined based on a comprehensive molar balance of adsorbed pfas including ultrashort chain compounds several pfas detected by suspect screening were identified and evaluated for adsorptive breakthrough characteristics these novel approaches offer fundamental and practical insights into the behavior and design of adsorptive pfas treatments 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot system the pilot was conducted onsite at a pfas contaminated municipal groundwater well in minnesota usa within an enclosed wellhouse three columns consisting of one

manufacturers including functionalities bulk densities and exchange capacities are listed in supplementary table s1 aer columns contained intermediate sample ports at approximately 1 4 and 1 2 of their total 98 cm bed depths the gac column contained intermediate ports at approximately 1 3 and 2 3 of the total 234 cm bed depth physical and hydraulic properties of each column sample port are given in fig 1 and si section s1 feedwater was sourced from a municipal groundwater well passed through a manganese dioxide granular pretreatment for manganese and iron removal and stored in level controlled intermediate holding tanks for pilot use water was pumped continuously from the holding tanks through a 1 µm cartridge filter into pilot columns which were operated over a 15 month 441 day period with some intermittent pauses in flow for pilot service during pauses columns were hydraulically isolated to prevent bed fluidization and de wetting of column pore space on two occurrences isolation failed and led to minor fluidization and re compaction of column beds each column operated with an uptime of over 89 57 148 bvs of water were treated in gac 211 947 bvs in aer1 and 218 775 bvs in aer2 further pilot operation details are reported in section s1 2 2 sample collection and analysis samples were collected on a weekly basis over the first 159 days of operation every two weeks for the next 147 days and every three weeks for 135 days until the end of the pilot influent p1 and effluent samples were collected consistently throughout pilot operation while p2 sample collection was phased in over the initial 40 days of operation after 6 sample time points the sampling protocol and quality control samples are detailed in the si section s2 additional water quality parameters were measured periodically during pfas sample collection section s3 pfas were extracted from water samples by weak anion exchange wax solid phase extraction spe followed by liquid chromatography

and 2 10 cf2 pfsa pfas concentrations were reported in acid form for their linear isomers unless explicitly stated as branched isomers e g br pfhxs branched isomers were identified in chromatograms as peaks with the same ms ms transitions but earlier retention times as linear isomer reference standards fig s1 in absence of available quantitative standards for most branched isomers reported

of all pfas analytes ms ms parameters quantitation and mdls is given in the si section s4 2 3 top assay and lc hrms analysis to elucidate the presence of unknown pfas a total oxidizable precursor top assay houtz and sedlak 2012 was conducted on influent groundwater to determine the abundance of potential unidentified targeted precursors section s5 lc high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms was employed to screen influent water for additional pfas that were not initially targeted in the lc ms ms method a full description of the suspect screening processes is detailed in the si section s6 briefly spe extracts from influent water samples were analyzed in negative mode with full scan plus data dependent ms2 acquisition using orbitrap ms thermo fisher q exactive hf exact mass features were screened against two curated mass lists containing over 1400 pfas nickerson et al 2020 pfasstructv3 2022 and ms2 fragmentation was compared with diagnostic and expected fragments using compound discoverer software thermo fisher the identified compounds were subsequently included in the lc ms ms method based on the main ms fragments to investigate their behavior in the pilot system select samples were re analyzed retrospectively to generate suspect breakthrough curves the breakthrough behavior was determined without reference standards based on relative response of analyte peak area values normalized to a structurally similar internal standard details of this suspect analysis are given in the si section s7 2 4 data analysis pfas breakthrough was reported as a nondimensional

retention time within respective functional classes independent of fluorinated tail structure fig s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of groundwater pfas contamination the groundwater used in the pilot was contaminated by production and disposal of pfas in the surrounding region historic pfoa and pfos production and contemporary pfbs production resulted in localized plumes of long chain pfas proximal to disposal sites and more widespread plumes of short chain pfas that extended to the study location measured groundwater ph was circumneutral ph 7 51 and background constituents included 0 71 mg l total organic carbon toc 37 1 mg l chloride 0 77 mg l nitrate and 58 0 mg l sulfate supplementary table s8 among the 33 targeted pfas 15 were detected consisting of linear 2 7 cf2 pfca 2 8 cf2 pfsa and 4 6 cf2 perfluorosulfonamides fasa table 1 these included ultrashort chain pfpra and pfets which have not previously been assessed for packed bed adsorptive treatment branched isomers of 4 7 cf2 pfca br pfca and 4 8 cf2 pfsa br pfsa co occurred with linear isomers comprising an increasing fraction of total compound with increasing chain length table 1 the presence of branched isomers was indicative of legacy production of long chain pfas by electrochemical fluorination ecf benskin et al 2009 the top assay results revealed a negligible increase 1 3 in total measured pfas mass post oxidation compared to untreated samples supplementary table s9 suggesting the majority of pfas mass in the pilot groundwater were pfaa identified and measured in this study see section 3 6 for further details on the identification of additional unknown pfas the profile of quantified pfas was uniquely dominated by pfca 79 and short chain 2 4 cf2 pfaa 89 with concentrations of short chain compounds nearly 2 orders of magnitude greater than their 7 8 cf2 homologs table 1 the most abundant pfas detected in groundwater were pfba 915 ng l pfpra 435 ng l pfbs 130 ng l and pfprs 95 ng l compounds expected to be extremely mobile in groundwater neuwald et al 2022 influent pfas concentrations remained generally stable throughout the pilot study table 1 fig s6 with coefficients of variation less than 27 for all analytes 3 2 linear pfas breakthrough characteristics breakthrough curves of targeted pfas showed several common characteristics across the tested adsorbents at full bed depths minimal breakthrough occurred for compounds with 5 cf2 chain lengths thus indicating efficient removal of longer chain compounds within the designed pilot operating period fig 2 a sample port data at intermediate bed depths p1 fig 2b p2 fig s7 yielded more complete breakthrough curves for all pfas enabling analysis of 1 5 4 times greater bv throughput but at reduced ebct discussed further in section 3 5 breakthrough curves at all sample ports generally followed an asymmetric sigmoidal shape illustrating initial periods of complete removal rapid loss of removal efficiency and eventual saturation as bv throughput progressed desorption c c0 100 also occurred for the shorter compounds 4cf2 in all columns suggesting a competitive adsorption process between different pfas discussed in section 3 4 intermittent nitrate and sulfate fig s8 and toc fig s9 measured at sample ports did not reveal discernable adsorption patterns over the duration of the pilot that could be compared to pfas breakthrough discontinuous breaks in the breakthrough curves denoted in fig 2 can be attributed to failed hydraulic isolation disrupting bed packing described in section 2 1 all columns displayed an increasing number of bvs to breakthrough with increasing pfca and pfsa chain length fig 2 characteristic of both gac and aer columns mccleaf et al 2017 park et al 2020b there were noticeable differences in breakthrough characteristics between pfas classes pfsa breakthrough occurred more slowly than equivalent length pfca breakthrough in all columns fig 2 in gac pfsa systematically broke through after pfca analogs containing n 1 cf2 units e g pfbs pfhxa in contrast pfsa breakthrough was drastically delayed in both aers pfsa compounds broke through after n 4 cf2 pfca e g pfets pfhpa breakthrough of fbsa a short chain fasa occurred much later than equivalent length pfpea and marginally later than pfbs in gac fig 2 this was in agreement with previously reported adsorption affinity of fasa pfsa pfca from other gac pilot studies fhxsa rodowa et al 2020 pfosa mccleaf et al 2017 in both aers fbsa breakthrough closely tracked that of pfhxa and preceded all pfsa this suggested relative class affinity for aers was pfsa fasa pfca retention of fbsa on aers suggests that it was present in a deprotonated r nh form in order to undergo anion exchange wang et al 2020 3 3 impacts of pfas branching on breakthrough branched pfaa systematically exhibited faster breakthrough compared to their linear isomers fig 3 illustrates overlaid breakthrough curves of linear and branched isomers from gac and aer1 sampled at p1 for gac breakthrough of both branched pfca and pfsa substantially overlapped those of n 1 cf2 linear homologs e g br pfhpa pfhxa in aer1 breakthrough curves of branched isomers were between those of their linear isomers and n 1 homologs e g pfhxa br pfhxa pfhpa nearly identical patterns were observed in aer2 fig s10 branching generally results in a reduction in hydrophobicity wang et al 2011 however hydrophobicity would not fully explain the observed reduction in adsorption the calculated hydrophobicity of mono methyl br pfhxs isomers log dow 1 39 supplementary table s10 known to predominate ecf derived pfas mixtures wang et al 2011 was marginally lower than for linear pfhxs log dow 1 65 however when compared to the dow value of linear pfpes log dow 0 95 the effects of isomeric structure were substantially smaller than reduction in chain length other factors including steric hinderance wang et al 2011 and variations in atomic charge park et al 2020a may also play a role in determining branched isomer adsorption although branched pfas breakthrough has frequently been reported to occur earlier than linear isomers in adsorptive treatment mccleaf et al 2017 rodowa et al 2020 to the authors knowledge this is the first study demonstrating a consistent pattern in adsorptive breakthrough among homologous series the obtained results demonstrate a potential advantage of aers in treating both branched and linear isomers more equally compared to gac which may be important when treating ecf derived pfas sources where branched isomers are prevalent continued consideration and differentiation of branched isomer treatability in future studies is warranted as toxicological understanding and regulation of these compounds evolves schulz et al 2020 3 4 comparison of pfas mass loading profiles temporal profiles of pfas mass adsorbed to columns during pilot operation were developed using a mass balance at p1 fig s11 and effluent ports fig s12 using accelerated throughput data from p1 mass loadings for all individual pfas branched and linear at the end of the pilot were evaluated supplementary table s11 gac retained 85 µg pfas g adsorbent after passing 165 662 bvs composed of 28 pfca and 71 pfsa mass compared to 79 pfca and 20 pfsa in untreated water aer1 and aer2 passed 704 646 and 724 340 bvs respectively and retained very similar masses of 441 and 460 µg g adsorbed pfsa accounted for 88 89 of adsorbed pfas mass on aers versus only 11 12 for pfca over a 7 fold difference total adsorbed pfas onto aer was over 5 times greater than gac on an adsorbent mass basis this difference would be expected to increase were the pilot to continue operation greater pfas capacity in aers compared to gac has been generally reported in continuous flow systems franke et al 2021 murray et al 2021 however actual adsorbent performance may be highly dependent on the presence of competing groundwater constituents such as natural organic matter nom and nitrate appleman et al 2013 dixit et al 2020 for example murray et al 2021 found an order of magnitude greater mass loading capacity for long and short chain pfas in a low background groundwater σ10pfas 18 9 µg l toc 2 6 mg l no3 0 19 mg l with macroporous calres 2301 aer compared to f400 gac calgon corporation on the other hand franke et al 2021 reported only a two fold greater pfas mass loading 37 µg g onto pfa694 aer also employed in aer1 resin compared to two different gacs 15 18 µg g treating nanofiltration concentrate σ11pfas 570 ng l doc 16 mg l no3 9 mg l although only a single water source was investigated in this pilot our results should be considered in the context of having low levels of competing constituents toc 0 71 mg l no3 0 77 mg l that may have had a minimal impact on adsorbent performance a comparison of mass loadings on a molar concentration basis identified distinct adsorption behaviors not obvious on a strict mass basis fig 4 illustrates the molar loading of pfas onto gac and aer1 beds at p1 over the course of the pilot for gac all measured pfaa appeared to compete for a finite number of adsorption sites as indicated by an asymptotic limit of 270 nmol pfas g adsorbent fig 4 weakly adsorbing short chain pfca initially occupied the majority of adsorption sites but were slowly displaced over time by more strongly adsorbing pfas pfsa and longer chain pfca this competitive replacement can also explain the asymmetric breakthrough curve shapes observed for longer chain pfas where the time to complete breakthrough is delayed relative to initial breakthrough fig 2 this phenomenon has been previously attributed to enhanced pfas adsorption through agglomeration or hemi micelle formation mccleaf et al 2017 which has been observed previously in high concentration batch studies zaggia et al 2016 however the lack of increasing total pfas adsorption capacity within the mass balance does not support that this process is of importance for environmentally relevant pfas concentrations instead competitive replacement offers a more plausible explanation for such behavior in contrast to gac aers did not reach a finite total pfaa adsorption capacity in the duration of the pilot fig 4a fig s13 aers quickly became saturated with pfca at approximate loadings of 175 200 nmol g fig 4b fig s13b pfsa loading increased nearly linearly for the duration of the pilot 1240 1290 nmol g at the final timepoint and low pfsa breakthrough fig 2b suggests substantially greater unused pfsa exchange capacity were the pilot to continue the observed selectivity for pfsa over pfca has been attributed to more negative atomic charges in the sulfonate headgroup compared to carboxylate due to inductive effects from oxygen resonance park et al 2020a based on the observed results the degree to which competitive replacement of more weakly adsorbing pfas occurred in aer was not clear aer2 displayed a loss of adsorbed pfpra and pfba mass over runtime at p1 fig s13 and the effluent fig s11 but aer1 maintained more variable loadings fig 4b the mass balance on pfpra onto aers was negative at p1 indicating poor accounting of this compound this demonstrated a limitation of the mass balance approach to quantify adsorption density where the rapid breakthrough profile of a poorly retained compound such as pfpra may not be adequately captured by a limited number of sample datapoints fig 2b based on the high observed pfsa selectivity it hypothesized that after long operating times pfsa would eventually competitively displace previously adsorbed pfca once unused pfsa exchange capacity was reached these results highlight a potential application of aers as high capacity pfsa selective treatments compared to less selective lower capacity gac to maximize usable bed life a treatment configuration could utilize a combination of aer and gac in series a lead aer bed would initially remove the most selectively adsorbed pfsa from water reserving the full capacity of a lag gac bed for non selective adsorption of pfca without competitive replacement by pfsa 3 5 utility and limitations of intermediate sample port data with reduced ebct a key limitation to pilot scale studies is the duration for which data can be collected at the end of this pilot high pfas removal in aer columns led to limited effluent breakthrough data to evaluate performance intermediate sample ports such as p1 fig 2b and p2 fig s7 can help fill data gaps through accelerated throughput on a bv basis but at reduced ebcts however reduced contact times can lower non equilibrium capacity of an adsorbent and lead to early initial breakthrough bv10 and decreased steepness of breakthrough curves murray et al 2021 park et al 2020b in contrast half breakthrough bv50 should represent apparent adsorption capacity that is less impacted by ebct effects corwin and summers 2011 to assess the magnitude of these ebct effects on this pilot bv10 and bv50 data for varying length pfca were compared across all tested sample ports fig 5 supplementary table s12 bv10 values across all columns decreased at lower ebct values indicating that intermediate sample ports consistently underestimated initial breakthrough compared to full length data effects were most pronounced at the lowest ebcts p1 bv10 values for 3 7 cf2 pfca were 70 81 of effluent values for gac p1 ebct 3 6 min and 21 84 for aers p1 ebct 0 81 min p2 bv10 values were 87 101 of effluent in gac p2 ebct 6 9 min and 67 112 in aers p2 ebct 1 4 min bv10 values of pfpra 2 cf2 showed a substantially higher variability 26 116 pfpra results can be attributed to the low sample bv resolution that poorly captured the shape of the initial breakthrough curve at intermediate sample ports thus leading to an inaccurate interpolation of bv10 interestingly agreement between lower ebct and higher ebct values decreased with chain length for gac but increased with chain length for aers for gac these effects could be related to mass transfer limitations within internal pore structure where pore blocking appleman et al 2013 and decreased diffusivity of higher molecular weight compounds park et al 2020b can negatively affect long chain pfas more than short chain pfas for aers an explanation for this opposite trend is less clear both increased park et al 2020a and decreased dixit et al 2020 aer adsorbent kinetics have been observed with pfas chain length and results may be dependent on aer structure such as hydrophobicity and matrix structure further investigation of structure related trends in breakthrough curve shape is warranted particularly for aers bv50 values were independent of ebct for all columns fig 5 which reflects an apparent equilibrium adsorption capacity independent of when initial breakthrough occurs park et al 2020b gac bv50 values overlapped closely between the different sample ports in contrast aer data showed greater variability between ports but no pattern with ebct the aer variability can most likely be attributed to operational differences such as bed disruptions these results suggest intermediate ports at reduced ebct can provide accurate estimates of half breakthrough and equilibrium adsorption capacity bv50 but conservative lower estimates of initial breakthrough bv10 for full length gac and aer columns in an accelerated manner when multiple intermediate port data are available ports with ebct closest to the full length design can minimize this underestimation of initial breakthrough 3 6 assessment of substituted pfsa treatability using suspect screening lc hrms analysis revealed the presence of three additional pfas that were not included in the targeted lc ms ms analysis exact mass retention time and ms2 data section s6 provide strong evidence that the compounds were unsaturated chain perfluorohexane sulfonic acid u pfhxs m z 360 9396 keto substituted perfluoropentane sulfonic acid k pfpes m z 326 9378 and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid k pfhxs m z 376 9346 pfas were identified with a confidence level of 3a positional isomer candidates since the exact positions of substituent double bond and keto groups in these compounds could not be determined charbonnet et al 2022 each of these substituted pfsa contain two fewer f atoms than their unsubstituted pfsa analog of equivalent chain length these compounds persisted after oxidation in the top assay data not shown suggesting substituted pfas had a similar chemical recalcitrance to their unsubstituted analogues keto substituted and unsaturated pfsa have been shown to co occur in pfas impacted groundwater and are presumed to be impurities formed during manufacturing barzen hanson et al 2017 wang et al 2020 xiao et al 2017 furthermore they have also been detected in human serum from communities consuming such groundwater mcdonough et al 2021 breakthrough curves for the newly identified substituted pfsa were generated to demonstrate how treatability of suspect compounds can be assessed for screened compounds in absence of reference standards fig 6 illustrates breakthrough curves generated for gac at p2 relative to similar length pfsa here distinct differences between compounds were apparent when comparing the obtained bv50 values the suspected substituted pfsa compounds all broke through the gac column more quickly than pfsa of equivalent cf2 length with the breakthrough trend of unsaturated pfsa keto pfsa pfsa e g u pfhxs k pfhxs pfpes this trend is in agreement with xiao et al 2017 who reported lower batch gac adsorption for k pfos and u pfos compared to pfhps in groundwater in the aers limited breakthrough data c c0 10 of the substituted pfsa suggested equally efficacious treatment compared to unsubstituted pfsa fig s14 initial breakthrough for both keto and unsaturated pfsa closely tracked their equivalent unsubstituted pfsa with equal cf2 e g u pfhxs k pfhxs pfpes although this trend necessitates validation at more substantial breakthrough thresholds it indicates a potential advantage of aer relative to gac in treating alternative pfas structures that co occur in contaminated water 3 7 quantitative pfas breakthrough trends using the port selection criteria described in section 3 5 estimated bv10 and bv50 values for all investigated pfas supplementary table s13 were compiled across all sample ports of each column to quantitatively compare estimated bed lives among the tested columns fig 7 a summary of all calculated values and associated sample ports is presented in supplementary table s12 for all homologous series bv10 and bv50 values were positively associated with chain length gac bv10 values for br pfhps and br pfos were outliers to this trend which may have been artifacts of estimating initial breakthrough of low influent concentration c0 2 1 ng l gac bv10 values ranged from 2782 for ultrashort chain pfpra to 85 811 for pfos bv10 values ranged 3629 683 810 for pfpra to pfbs in aer1 and 4852 353 571 for pfpra to pfprs in aer2 breakthrough of longer chain pfsa did not occur in the duration of the study and were therefore at least 700 000 bvs between tested adsorbents bv10 values for the shortest chain pfca and fbsa 2 4 cf2 were comparable between gac and both aers aer bv10 values surpassed gac for pfhxa and were increasingly larger for longer chain pfca and all pfsa supplementary table s13 similarly aer bv50 values were greater for all compounds except ultrashort chain pfpra and pfba 2 3 cf2 these results agree with pilot results reported by mccleaf et al 2017 which showed greater aer bv10 values compared to gac for all pfsa and pfca with 5 cf2 in contrast bv50 bv10 ratios were lower for all compounds in gac 1 2 2 7 compared to either aer 1 4 4 9 supplementary table s13 describing steeper breakthrough curves for gac under the tested conditions steeper breakthrough curves indicate greater utilization of adsorbent capacity before initial breakthrough compared to more gradual breakthrough curves with mass transfer limitations practically greater bv10 values and adsorbent utilization may be achieved by increasing overall ebct through larger sized treatment vessels or multiple columns in series a lead lag configuration despite nominally different resin functionalities indicated by manufacturers aer1 complex amino groups and aer2 tributyl amino groups breakthrough characteristics were very similar fig 7b marginally longer bv values for aer2 supplementary table s13 can likely be attributed to operational variability from single replicate columns rather than true performance improvements correlating breakthrough performance with physical descriptors has potential utility to extrapolate data for compounds with unmeasured breakthrough in a treatment system using readily available log dow and lc retention time data both of which reflect hydrophobicity gac bv10 values showed reasonable linear association r2 of 0 80 and 0 76 respectively fig s15 however these had poor association for aer r2 0 24 for both adsorbents pfsa breakthrough was underpredicted and pfca overpredicted highlighting a limitation for hydrophobicity to account for differences between classes as previously mentioned in section 3 3 total negative molecular charge has been suggested as a descriptor capable of predicting adsorption to aers between classes park et al 2020a however these values require computationally intensive calculations to estimate nor have they been previously published for pfas given the ubiquity of homologous pfas series in contaminated waters and consistent differences in calculated hydrophobicities between homologs δlogd 0 7 per cf2 unit supplementary table s7 a simpler approach is to correlate class specific chain length with breakthrough in gac the relationship between breakthrough bv10 and bv50 and chain length for different classes was approximately linear r2 0 96 0 99 fig 7a interestingly the slopes of the linear correlations between different pfas classes were similar at each breakthrough level supplementary table s14 with an average increase in breakthrough bv of 12 806 and 21 440 per cf2 unit at bv10 and bv50 respectively even though the aer breakthrough data were more limited class specific breakthrough showed a log linear relationship r2 0 92 0 99 with chain length fig 7b slopes were nearly parallel between both aers and between pfas classes supplementary table s14 bv10 increased an average of 0 342 0 371 log per cf2 unit and bv50 0 391 0 399 log equivalent slopes between pfas classes indicate that adsorption affinity increases equally with cf2 addition independent of functional group mccleaf et al 2017 noted previously that percent pfas removal had a linear relationship with chain length in both gac and aer columns and that these trends were parallel between both pfca and pfsa which also supports this consistent additive effect equivalent slopes between both aers also suggest very similar functional characteristics between the aer1 and aer2 adsorbents an important characteristic of the chain length trends observed in this study is that they occurred despite differing individual influent homolog concentrations c0 micropollutants at trace concentrations e g ng l and low µg l range have been previously shown to follow linear isotherms in the presence of more abundant adsorbates e g mg l range nom indicating that equilibrium adsorption density increased proportionally with c0 at low concentrations graham et al 2000 knappe et al 1998 although pfas have been shown to follow nonlinear isotherms on gac and aer at an elevated concentration µg l mg l range boyer et al 2021 du et al 2015 pfas adsorption studies at trace concentrations have supported an independence of percent adsorption from initial concentrations mccleaf et al 2017 wang et al 2020 these concentration independent trends could be useful in approximating the bed lives of more strongly adsorbed pfas based on their shorter chain homologs when pilot runtime is limited for example bv10 relationship for 2 4 cf2 pfsa in aer1 can be leveraged to estimate initial breakthrough times for longer chain pfhxs and pfos to be on the order of 3 106 and 1 107 bvs respectively throughput values that could not reasonably be achieved in the timespan of the pilot fig 7b this could be particularly useful in estimating treatment performance in waters where long chain pfas predominate and drive treatment goals 3 8 practical considerations for adsorbent selection although nondimensionalized bvs provide a scalable performance comparison between adsorbents treatment selection must also consider costs related to adsorptive media usage during operation from a sizing perspective a gac treatment designed with 10 min ebct would require 4 times more media than an aer treatment designed with 2 5 min ebct for an equal volume of water this quantity difference may be offset partially by substantially higher bulk media costs of aers compared to gac franke et al 2021 murray et al 2021 supplier provided prices of aers in this pilot were on average 4 times greater than gac in 2021 and 3 times greater in 2022 on a bulk volume basis supplementary table s15 which approximately balances the differences in media volume spent adsorbent disposal or regeneration costs may vary substantially depending on local regulations but were estimated here and elsewhere franke et al 2021 to be comparable between adsorbent types capital costs such as treatment vessels pretreatment and pump systems may also substantially influence the lifetime cost of each treatment but they will vary greatly depending on design criteria supply chain and location operational costs are greatly impacted by media changeout frequency murray et al 2021 actual media service life before requiring changeout can provide important insight into the practical advantages of different technologies particularly when changeout costs are comparable estimated full scale service times bvs treated ebcteffluent of individual linear pfas were compared for all columns at media changeout thresholds of 10 and 50 breakthrough using bv data from section 3 7 fig 8 a times to 10 breakthrough of 2 4 cf2 pfca were under 142 days in gac and 61 days for aers indicating multiple media changeouts would be required every year to manage short chain pfca gac showed a service time advantage over aer for 10 breakthrough of short chain fbsa and 2 6 cf2 pfca however its advantage at 50 breakthrough was limited to fbsa and the shortest chain 2 4 cf2 pfca for longer pfca and all pfsa aer service times exceeded gac times to 10 breakthrough were at least 3 times greater in aers and were in excess of 1200 days for pfbs and longer chain compounds fig 8a under the current regulatory paradigm treatment goals are often dictated by a summative threshold concentration for multiple compounds in this pilot treatments were compared based on a weighed composite health based index hi equation s3 set by the minnesota department of health 2022 for six pfaa compounds ranging from 15 ng l pfos to 7 µg l pfba supplementary table s16 treatment bed service time was determined based on requisite media changeout after an hi value exceeded a value of 0 5 fig 8b applying only linear pfas concentrations to this hi service times for aer1 731 days and aer2 757 days were approximately 2 3 times higher than for gac 321 days highlighting a clear advantage of aers for minnesota s treatment goal notably the strong retention of short chain pfbs onto aers contributed most to their longer service life if incorporating both branched and linear pfas concentrations into the hi value fig 8b service times would decrease approximately 10 gac and over 8 aers the potential for branched isomers to substantially add to hi values and decrease service times highlights the need for explicit guidance on branched pfas quantitation in analytical methods and regulatory frameworks despite the observed advantages of aer for pfas removal there are other important factors that should be considered for adsorbent selection as noted in section 3 4 site specific water characteristics may have a large influence on the performances of aer and gac waters with elevated levels of hydrophobic nom and inorganic anions have been found to reduce pfas adsorption to different degrees through adsorption site competition and pore blocking appleman et al 2013 dixit et al 2019 2020 inorganic particulate and microbial growth can also clog pore space leading to increased column head loss and a reduction in usable bed life de vera et al 2019 an initial iteration of this pilot setup was aborted after 2 weeks due to iron and manganese particulate causing the system to over pressurize necessitating installation of a pretreatment system upstream of the pilot columns in the current study section s1 even with pretreatment head loss increased 2 6 3 4 fold over the duration of the pilot for all columns supplementary table s17 although microbial growth was not indicated to play a major role in this pilot due to low toc and nutrient concentrations biofouling may be a substantially greater issue in waters with higher organic loadings common mitigation measures to reduce backpressure and fouling for gac such as backwash and chemical oxidant addition de vera et al 2019 are not suitable for aers backwash is not recommended due to poor stratification of uniform resin beads leading to bed disruptions that can disturb bed mass transfer zones purolite 2021 this effect was visible in aer breakthrough curves when bed disruptions occurred fig 2 the gel aers used in this study also cannot be exposed to oxidants such as chlorine which can destroy resin and form nitrosamines purolite 2021 the high selectivity of aers for anionic pfas may limit their application in treating waters where diverse co contaminants also require treatment including nonionic and zwitterionic pfas wang et al 2020 in contrast gac is well suited to treat a wide range of organic co pollutants redding et al 2009 which may be valuable from a holistic water quality perspective the outcomes of this study highlight several important research needs most importantly there is a need for large scale continuous flow treatability data across a wider range of water chemistries pfas profiles and adsorbents standardized and transparent reporting of key design and performance metrics such as breakthrough times e g bv10 model parameters and background water quality can aid inter study comparisons and heuristics crucial to treatment design improvements furthermore developing validated methods to rapidly test and predict treatability of full scale systems in abbreviated timespans will aid more widespread continuous flow data collection pilot studies are very time and capital intensive robust sampling and analytical efforts are critical to yield sufficient breakthrough data that allow for a meaningful interpretation of the results fig 2a although techniques such as rapid small scale columns have begun to be tested for aers schaefer et al 2019 validation of scaling models to full scale data has yet to be achieved finally advances are needed in adsorptive treatment of abundant but poorly adsorbed short chain pfca such as pfba treatment processes that incorporate in situ aer regeneration which shows greatest efficacy in restoring capacity for short chain pfca liu and sun 2021 could be utilized to extend service times for these particularly challenging compounds 4 conclusions intermediate sample ports provided crucial sample data to comprehensively evaluate a long running pilot with low effluent breakthrough sample port data must be interpreted carefully as initial breakthrough can be underestimated at lower ebct sample port data provided a more robust estimation of half breakthrough which is reflective of equilibrium adsorption capacity molar mass balances across adsorbents revealed different adsorption behaviors gac displayed a clear finite capacity for total measured pfas and exhibited competitive replacement of short chain pfca with longer chain pfca and pfsa over the course of operation the aers reached a finite capacity for pfca but not pfsa in the duration of this study evidence of much greater pfsa selectivity with all influent pfas concentrations in the ng l range homologous series of pfca and pfsa followed quantitative relationships between chain length and breakthrough independent of their individual concentrations aers exhibited a log linear relationship between bv10 and bv50 with chain length for gac this relationship was less steep and followed an approximately linear trend similar slopes between compound classes suggested an equal additive effect of increased cf2 unit independent of head group functionality branched pfaa keto pfsa and unsaturated pfsa exhibited faster breakthrough than their unmodified linear structures aer performance was generally superior to gac on a breakthrough and mass adsorption basis tested gel aers outperformed gac marginally for long chain pfca and substantially for all pfsa all adsorbents had short bed lives for the shortest chain 2 4 cf2 pfca both tested aers had similar mass adsorption and bed lives modifications from a linear pfas structure branching keto group unsaturation negatively impacted gac removal more substantially than aers for long term adsorptive design considerations treatment should be considered more holistically in terms

15333,widespread contamination of groundwater with per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas has required drinking water producers to quickly adopt practical and efficacious treatments to limit human exposure and deleterious health outcomes this pilot scale study comparatively investigated pfas adsorption behaviors in granular activated carbon gac and two strong base gel anion exchange resin aer columns operated in parallel over a 441 day period to treat contaminated groundwater dominated by short chain perfluorocarboxylic acids pfca highly resolved breakthrough profiles of homologous series of 2 8 cf2 pfca and perfluorosulfonic acids pfsa including ultrashort chain compounds and branched isomers were measured to elucidate adsorption trends sample ports at intermediate bed depths could predict 50 breakthrough of compounds on an accelerated basis but lower empty bed contact times led to conservative estimates of initial breakthrough homologous pfas series displayed linear gac and log linear aer relationships between chain length and breakthrough independent of initial concentration aers generally outperformed gac on a normalized bed volume basis and this advantage widened with increasing pfas chain length as designed all treatments would have short full scale service times 142 days for gac 61 days for aers before initial breakthrough of short chain 2 4 cf2 pfca however aer displayed far longer breakthrough times for pfsa compared to gac 3 treatment time and breakthrough was not observed for pfsa with 4 cf2 in aers gac had a finite molar adsorption capacity for total pfas leading to a stoichiometric replacement of short chain pfca by pfsa and longer chain pfca over time aers quickly reached a finite adsorption capacity for pfca but they showed substantially greater selectivity for pfsa whose capacity was not reached within the duration of the pilot breakthrough characteristics of keto and unsaturated pfsa identified in the groundwater by suspect screening were also evaluated in absence of reference standards modified pfas structures branched keto unsaturated broke through faster than linear and unmodified perfluorinated structures with equal degrees of fluorination and the effects were more pronounced in gac compared to aers the results highlight that the design of robust pfas treatment systems should consider facets beyond current pfas targets including operational complexities and impacts of unregulated and unmonitored co contaminants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords drinking water treatment per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas ion exchange granular activated carbon adsorption data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas are a wide ranging group of persistent fluorine substituted organic chemicals of worldwide environmental health concern widespread pfas detection in drinking water sources has prompted utilities to implement treatments to meet increasingly stringent health guidelines and regulations european union 2020 u s epa 2022 current drinking water regulatory guidelines emphasize treatment of legacy medium to long chain pfas 6 cf2 such as pfhxs pfoa and pfos hu et al 2016 massachusetts department of environmental protection 2020 however a shift in production and regulatory scrutiny to short chain compounds such as pfba pfbs and genx brendel et al 2018 u s epa 2022 has necessitated treatment consideration of these less hydrophobic substitutes pfas particularly persistent anionic perfluoroalkyl acids pfaa are not effectively removed in conventional water treatment processes due to their solubility and the recalcitrance of carbon fluorine bonds appleman et al 2014 rahman et al 2014 however advanced physical chemical separation processes including adsorption and high pressure membranes e g reverse osmosis and nanofiltration have demonstrated efficacious pfas removal under a variety of source water conditions appleman et al 2014 boyer et al 2021 liu et al 2021 adsorptive processes are particularly appealing water treatment options due to their low pressure operating conditions lack of concentrated aqueous waste streams and potential for future regeneration and reuse franke et al 2021 zaggia et al 2016 adsorptive media such as granular activated carbon gac and anion exchange resins aers remove pfas through a combination of electrostatic interactions with charged headgroups and non electrostatic interactions with hydrophobic fluorinated tail groups du et al 2014 gac adsorption can be primarily attributed to attraction to hydrophobic pore surfaces with secondary electrostatic attraction or repulsion depending on the net surface charge of the gac park et al 2020b aer adsorption is based on a combination of selective ion exchange interactions with cationic resin functional groups and hydrophobic interactions with the resin boyer et al 2021 zaggia et al 2016 despite widespread implementation of gac treatment for a variety of micropollutants interest in aers has grown specifically for pfas due to their high capacity and selectivity particularly towards perfluorosulfonic acids pfsa and longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids pfca franke et al 2021 mccleaf et al 2017 murray et al 2021 additionally aer treatments can be designed with shorter empty bed contact times ebct 1 5 3 mins and vessel footprints compared to gac 8 13 min murray et al 2021 purolite 2021 because of the influence of hydrophobic interactions both gac and aer exhibit higher efficacy treating long chain pfas compared to more hydrophilic short chain homologs appleman et al 2014 mccleaf et al 2017 these technologies have not been comprehensively compared for treatment of groundwater dominated by shorter chain pfca pilot scale adsorptive treatability studies are crucial to evaluate the efficacy of different treatment technologies under site specific water matrix characteristics pfas contaminant profiles and treatment goals continuous flow pfas treatment studies to date have been primarily limited to targeted pfaa particularly water with substantial fractions of long chain pfsa boyer et al 2021 gagliano et al 2020 co occurrence of dozens of additional pfas classes have been revealed by suspect screening of contaminated groundwater barzen hanson et al 2017 nickerson et al 2020 however they are rarely evaluated for treatability once identified liu and sun 2021 wang et al 2020 furthermore treatability of co occurring ultrashort chain 2 3 cf2 and branched pfaa isomers in groundwater are not often considered neuwald et al 2022 rahman et al 2014 obscuring a more complete understanding of competitive pfas adsorption behaviors considering the time and cost required to operate pilot scale treatment studies it is important to maximize the analytical value of each tested system to develop a more comprehensive understanding of long term adsorption behavior in complex pfas mixtures this study provides a comparative characterization of pfas adsorption behaviors onto gac and aers based on a 15 month pilot scale treatment of contaminated groundwater using highly resolved multi port breakthrough data systematic treatability trends were elucidated for each adsorbent type based on pfas chain length head group functionality and branching tail structure new insights into competitive adsorption were determined based on a comprehensive molar balance of adsorbed pfas including ultrashort chain compounds several pfas detected by suspect screening were identified and evaluated for adsorptive breakthrough characteristics these novel approaches offer fundamental and practical insights into the behavior and design of adsorptive pfas treatments 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot system the pilot was conducted onsite at a pfas contaminated municipal groundwater well in minnesota usa within an enclosed wellhouse three columns consisting of one

given in fig 1 and si section s1 feedwater was sourced from a municipal groundwater well passed through a manganese dioxide granular pretreatment for manganese and iron removal and stored in level controlled intermediate holding tanks for pilot use water was pumped continuously from the holding tanks through a 1 µm cartridge filter into pilot columns which were operated over a 15 month 441 day period with some intermittent pauses in flow for pilot service during pauses columns were hydraulically isolated to prevent bed fluidization and de wetting of column pore space on two occurrences isolation failed and led to minor fluidization and re compaction of column beds each column operated with an uptime of over 89 57 148 bvs of water were treated in gac 211 947 bvs in aer1 and 218 775 bvs in aer2 further pilot operation details are reported in section s1 2 2 sample collection and analysis samples were collected on a weekly basis over the first 159 days of operation every two weeks for the next 147 days and every three weeks for 135 days until the end of the pilot influent p1 and effluent samples were collected consistently throughout pilot operation while p2 sample collection was phased in over the initial 40 days of operation after 6 sample time points the sampling protocol and quality control samples are detailed in the si section s2 additional water quality parameters

of all pfas analytes ms ms parameters quantitation and mdls is given in the si section s4 2 3 top assay and lc hrms analysis to elucidate the presence of unknown pfas a total oxidizable precursor top assay houtz and sedlak 2012 was conducted on influent groundwater to determine the abundance of potential unidentified targeted precursors section s5 lc high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms was employed to screen influent water for additional pfas that were not initially targeted in the lc ms ms method a full description of the suspect screening processes is detailed in the si section s6 briefly spe extracts from influent water samples were analyzed in negative mode with full scan plus data dependent ms2 acquisition using orbitrap ms thermo fisher q exactive hf exact mass features were screened against two curated mass lists containing over 1400 pfas nickerson et al 2020 pfasstructv3 2022 and ms2 fragmentation was compared with diagnostic and expected fragments using compound discoverer software thermo fisher the identified compounds were subsequently included in the lc ms ms method based on the main ms fragments to investigate their behavior in the pilot system select samples were re analyzed retrospectively to generate suspect breakthrough curves the breakthrough behavior was determined without reference standards based on relative response of analyte peak area

nonlinear regression algorithm minpack lm r package models were only fitted to data points where c c0 did not exceed 100 to exclude desorption regions of certain breakthrough curves not well described

retention time within respective functional classes independent of fluorinated tail structure fig s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of groundwater pfas contamination the groundwater used in the pilot was contaminated by production and disposal of pfas in the surrounding region historic pfoa and pfos production and contemporary pfbs production resulted in localized plumes of long chain pfas proximal to disposal sites and more widespread plumes of short chain pfas that extended to the study location measured groundwater ph was circumneutral ph 7 51 and background constituents included 0 71 mg l total organic carbon toc 37 1 mg l chloride 0 77 mg l nitrate and 58 0 mg l sulfate supplementary table s8 among the 33 targeted pfas 15 were detected consisting of linear 2 7 cf2 pfca 2 8 cf2 pfsa and 4 6 cf2 perfluorosulfonamides fasa table 1 these included ultrashort chain pfpra and pfets which have not previously been assessed for packed bed adsorptive treatment branched isomers of 4 7 cf2 pfca br pfca and 4 8 cf2 pfsa br pfsa co occurred with linear isomers comprising an increasing fraction of total compound with increasing chain length table 1 the presence of branched isomers was indicative of legacy production of long chain pfas by electrochemical fluorination ecf benskin et al 2009 the top assay results revealed a negligible increase 1 3 in total measured pfas mass post oxidation compared to untreated samples supplementary table s9 suggesting the majority of pfas mass in the pilot groundwater were pfaa identified and measured in this study see section 3 6 for further details on the identification of additional unknown pfas the profile of quantified pfas was uniquely dominated by pfca 79 and short chain 2 4 cf2 pfaa 89 with concentrations of short chain compounds nearly 2 orders of magnitude greater than their 7 8 cf2 homologs table 1 the most abundant pfas detected in groundwater were pfba 915 ng l pfpra 435 ng l pfbs 130 ng l and pfprs 95 ng l compounds expected to be extremely mobile in groundwater neuwald et al 2022 influent pfas concentrations remained generally stable throughout the pilot study table 1 fig s6 with coefficients of variation less than 27 for all analytes 3 2 linear pfas breakthrough characteristics breakthrough curves of targeted pfas showed several common characteristics across the tested adsorbents at full bed depths minimal breakthrough occurred for compounds with 5 cf2 chain lengths thus indicating efficient removal of longer chain compounds within the designed pilot operating period fig 2 a sample port data at intermediate bed depths p1 fig 2b p2 fig s7 yielded more complete breakthrough curves for all pfas enabling analysis of 1 5 4 times greater bv throughput but at reduced ebct discussed further in section 3 5 breakthrough curves at all sample ports generally followed an asymmetric sigmoidal shape illustrating initial periods of complete removal rapid loss of removal efficiency and eventual saturation as bv throughput progressed desorption c c0 100 also occurred for the shorter compounds 4cf2 in all columns suggesting a competitive adsorption process between different pfas discussed in section 3 4 intermittent nitrate and sulfate fig s8 and toc fig s9 measured at sample ports did not reveal discernable adsorption patterns over the duration of the pilot that could be compared to pfas breakthrough discontinuous breaks in the breakthrough curves denoted in fig 2 can be attributed to failed hydraulic isolation disrupting bed packing described in section 2 1 all columns displayed an increasing number of bvs to breakthrough with increasing pfca and pfsa chain length fig 2 characteristic of both gac and aer columns mccleaf et al 2017 park et al 2020b there were noticeable differences in breakthrough characteristics between pfas classes pfsa breakthrough occurred more slowly than equivalent length pfca breakthrough in all columns fig 2 in gac pfsa systematically broke through after pfca analogs containing n 1 cf2 units e g pfbs pfhxa in contrast pfsa breakthrough was drastically delayed in both aers pfsa compounds broke through after n 4 cf2 pfca e g pfets pfhpa breakthrough of fbsa a short chain fasa occurred much later than equivalent length pfpea and marginally later than pfbs in gac fig 2 this was in agreement with previously reported adsorption affinity of fasa pfsa pfca from other gac pilot studies fhxsa rodowa et al 2020 pfosa mccleaf et al 2017 in both aers fbsa breakthrough closely tracked that of pfhxa and preceded all pfsa this suggested relative class affinity for aers was pfsa fasa pfca retention of fbsa on aers suggests that it was present in a deprotonated r nh form in order to undergo anion exchange wang et al 2020 3 3 impacts of pfas branching on breakthrough branched pfaa systematically exhibited faster breakthrough compared to their linear isomers fig 3 illustrates overlaid breakthrough curves of linear and branched isomers from gac and aer1 sampled at p1 for gac breakthrough of both branched pfca and pfsa substantially overlapped those of n 1 cf2 linear homologs e g br pfhpa pfhxa in aer1 breakthrough curves of branched isomers were between those of their linear isomers and n 1 homologs e g pfhxa br pfhxa pfhpa nearly identical patterns were observed in aer2 fig s10 branching generally results in a reduction in hydrophobicity wang et al 2011 however hydrophobicity would not fully explain the observed reduction in adsorption the calculated hydrophobicity of mono methyl br pfhxs isomers log dow 1 39 supplementary table s10 known to predominate ecf derived pfas mixtures wang et al 2011 was marginally lower than for linear pfhxs log dow 1 65 however when compared to the dow value of linear pfpes log dow 0 95 the effects of isomeric structure were substantially smaller than reduction in chain length other factors including steric hinderance wang et al 2011 and variations in atomic charge park et al 2020a may also play a role in determining branched isomer adsorption although branched pfas breakthrough has frequently been reported to occur earlier than linear isomers in adsorptive treatment mccleaf et al 2017 rodowa et al 2020 to the authors knowledge this is the first study demonstrating a consistent pattern in adsorptive breakthrough among homologous series the obtained results demonstrate a potential advantage of aers in treating both branched and linear isomers more equally compared to gac which may be important when treating ecf derived pfas sources where branched isomers are prevalent continued consideration and differentiation of branched isomer treatability in future studies is warranted as toxicological understanding and regulation of these compounds evolves schulz et al 2020 3 4 comparison of pfas mass loading profiles temporal profiles of pfas mass adsorbed to columns during pilot operation were developed using a mass balance at p1 fig s11 and effluent ports fig s12 using accelerated throughput data from p1 mass loadings for all individual pfas branched and linear at the end of the pilot were evaluated supplementary table s11 gac retained 85 µg pfas g adsorbent after passing 165 662 bvs composed of 28 pfca and 71 pfsa mass compared to 79 pfca and 20 pfsa in untreated water aer1 and aer2 passed 704 646 and 724 340 bvs respectively and retained very similar masses of 441 and 460 µg g adsorbed pfsa accounted for 88 89 of adsorbed pfas mass on aers versus only 11 12 for pfca over a 7 fold difference total adsorbed pfas onto aer was over 5 times greater than gac on an adsorbent mass basis this difference would be expected to increase were the pilot to continue operation greater pfas capacity in aers compared to gac has been generally reported in continuous flow systems franke et al 2021 murray et al 2021 however actual adsorbent performance may be highly dependent on the presence of competing groundwater constituents such as natural organic matter nom and nitrate appleman et al 2013 dixit et al 2020 for example murray et al 2021 found an order of magnitude greater mass loading capacity for long and short chain pfas in a low background groundwater σ10pfas 18 9 µg l toc 2 6 mg l no3 0 19 mg l with macroporous calres 2301 aer compared to f400 gac calgon corporation on the other hand franke et al 2021 reported only a two fold greater pfas mass loading 37 µg g onto pfa694 aer also employed in aer1 resin compared to two different gacs 15 18 µg g treating nanofiltration concentrate σ11pfas 570 ng l doc 16 mg l no3 9 mg l although only a single water source was investigated in this pilot our results should be considered in the context of having low levels of competing constituents toc 0 71 mg l no3 0 77 mg l that may have had a minimal impact on adsorbent performance a comparison of mass loadings on a molar concentration basis identified distinct adsorption behaviors not obvious on a strict mass basis fig 4 illustrates the molar loading of pfas onto gac and aer1 beds at p1 over the course of the pilot for gac all measured pfaa appeared to compete for a finite number of adsorption sites as indicated by an asymptotic limit of 270 nmol pfas g adsorbent fig 4 weakly adsorbing short chain pfca initially occupied the majority of adsorption sites but were slowly displaced over time by more strongly adsorbing pfas pfsa and longer chain pfca this competitive replacement can also explain the asymmetric breakthrough curve shapes observed for longer chain pfas where the time to complete breakthrough is delayed relative to initial breakthrough fig 2 this phenomenon has been previously attributed to enhanced pfas adsorption through agglomeration or hemi micelle formation mccleaf et al 2017 which has been observed previously in high concentration batch studies zaggia et al 2016 however the lack of increasing total pfas adsorption capacity within the mass balance does not support that this process is of importance for environmentally relevant pfas concentrations instead competitive replacement offers a more plausible explanation for such behavior in contrast to gac aers did not reach a finite total pfaa adsorption capacity in the duration of the pilot fig 4a fig s13 aers quickly became saturated with pfca at approximate loadings of 175 200 nmol g fig 4b fig s13b pfsa loading increased nearly linearly for the duration of the pilot 1240 1290 nmol g at the final timepoint and low pfsa breakthrough fig 2b suggests substantially greater unused pfsa exchange capacity were the pilot to continue the observed selectivity for pfsa over pfca has been attributed to more negative atomic charges in the sulfonate headgroup compared to carboxylate due to inductive effects from oxygen resonance park et al 2020a based on the observed results the degree to which competitive replacement of more weakly adsorbing pfas occurred in aer was not clear aer2 displayed a loss of adsorbed pfpra and pfba mass over runtime at p1 fig s13 and the effluent fig s11 but aer1 maintained more variable loadings fig 4b the mass balance on pfpra onto aers was negative at p1 indicating poor accounting of this compound this demonstrated a limitation of the mass balance approach to quantify adsorption density where the rapid breakthrough profile of a poorly retained compound such as pfpra may not be adequately captured by a limited number of sample datapoints fig 2b based on the high observed pfsa selectivity it hypothesized that after long operating times pfsa would eventually competitively displace previously adsorbed pfca once unused pfsa exchange capacity was reached these results highlight a potential application of aers as high capacity pfsa selective treatments compared to less selective lower capacity gac to maximize usable bed life a treatment configuration could utilize a combination of aer and gac in series a lead aer bed would initially remove the most selectively adsorbed pfsa from water reserving the full capacity of a lag gac bed for non selective adsorption of pfca without competitive replacement by pfsa 3 5 utility and limitations of intermediate sample port data with reduced ebct a key limitation to pilot scale studies is the duration for which data can be collected at the end of this pilot high pfas removal in aer columns led to limited effluent breakthrough data to evaluate performance intermediate sample ports such as p1 fig 2b and p2 fig s7 can help fill data gaps through accelerated throughput on a bv basis but at reduced ebcts however reduced contact times can lower non equilibrium capacity of an adsorbent and lead to early initial breakthrough bv10 and decreased steepness of breakthrough curves murray et al 2021 park et al 2020b in contrast half breakthrough bv50 should represent apparent adsorption capacity that is less impacted by ebct effects corwin and summers 2011 to assess the magnitude of these ebct effects on this pilot bv10 and bv50 data for varying length pfca were compared across all tested sample ports fig 5 supplementary table s12 bv10 values across all columns decreased at lower ebct values indicating that intermediate sample ports consistently underestimated initial breakthrough compared to full length data effects were most pronounced at the lowest ebcts p1 bv10 values for 3 7 cf2 pfca were 70 81 of effluent values for gac p1 ebct 3 6 min and 21 84 for aers p1 ebct 0 81 min p2 bv10 values were 87 101 of effluent in gac p2 ebct 6 9 min and 67 112 in aers p2 ebct 1 4 min bv10 values of pfpra 2 cf2 showed a substantially higher variability 26 116 pfpra results can be attributed to the low sample bv resolution that poorly captured the shape of the initial breakthrough curve at intermediate sample ports thus leading to an inaccurate interpolation of bv10 interestingly agreement between lower ebct and higher ebct values decreased with chain length for gac but increased with chain length for aers for gac these effects could be related to mass transfer limitations within internal pore structure where pore blocking appleman et al 2013 and decreased diffusivity of higher molecular weight compounds park et al 2020b can negatively affect long chain pfas more than short chain pfas for aers an explanation for this opposite trend is less clear both increased park et al 2020a and decreased dixit et al 2020 aer adsorbent kinetics have been observed with pfas chain length and results may be dependent on aer structure such as hydrophobicity and matrix structure further investigation of structure related trends in breakthrough curve shape is warranted particularly for aers bv50 values were independent of ebct for all columns fig 5 which reflects an apparent equilibrium adsorption capacity independent of when initial breakthrough occurs park et al 2020b gac bv50 values overlapped closely between the different sample ports in contrast aer data showed greater variability between ports but no pattern with ebct the aer variability can most likely be attributed to operational differences such as bed disruptions these results suggest intermediate ports at reduced ebct can provide accurate estimates of half breakthrough and equilibrium adsorption capacity bv50 but conservative lower estimates of initial breakthrough bv10 for full length gac and aer columns in an accelerated manner when multiple intermediate port data are available ports with ebct closest to the full length design can minimize this underestimation of initial breakthrough 3 6 assessment of substituted pfsa treatability using suspect screening lc hrms analysis revealed the presence of three additional pfas that were not included in the targeted lc ms ms analysis exact mass retention time and ms2 data section s6 provide strong evidence that the compounds were unsaturated chain perfluorohexane sulfonic acid u pfhxs m z 360 9396 keto substituted perfluoropentane sulfonic acid k pfpes m z 326 9378 and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid k pfhxs m z 376 9346 pfas were identified with a confidence level of 3a positional isomer candidates since the exact positions of substituent double bond and keto groups in these compounds could not be determined charbonnet et al 2022 each of these substituted pfsa contain two fewer f atoms than their unsubstituted pfsa analog of equivalent chain length these compounds persisted after oxidation in the top assay data not shown suggesting substituted pfas had a similar chemical recalcitrance to their unsubstituted analogues keto substituted and unsaturated pfsa have been shown to co occur in pfas impacted groundwater and are presumed to be impurities formed during manufacturing barzen hanson et al 2017 wang et al 2020 xiao et al 2017 furthermore they have also been detected in human serum from communities consuming such groundwater mcdonough et al 2021 breakthrough curves for the newly identified substituted pfsa were generated to demonstrate how treatability of suspect compounds can be assessed for screened compounds in absence of reference standards fig 6 illustrates breakthrough curves generated for gac at p2 relative to similar length pfsa here distinct differences between compounds were apparent when comparing the obtained bv50 values the suspected substituted pfsa compounds all broke through the gac column more quickly than pfsa of equivalent cf2 length with the breakthrough trend of unsaturated pfsa keto pfsa pfsa e g u pfhxs k pfhxs pfpes this trend is in agreement with xiao et al 2017 who reported lower batch gac adsorption for k pfos and u pfos compared to pfhps in groundwater in the aers limited breakthrough data c c0 10 of the substituted pfsa suggested equally efficacious treatment compared to unsubstituted pfsa fig s14 initial breakthrough for both keto and unsaturated pfsa closely tracked their equivalent unsubstituted pfsa with equal cf2 e g u pfhxs k pfhxs pfpes although this trend necessitates validation at more substantial breakthrough thresholds it indicates a potential advantage of aer relative to gac in treating alternative pfas structures that co occur in contaminated water 3 7 quantitative pfas breakthrough trends using the port selection criteria described in section 3 5 estimated bv10 and bv50 values for all investigated pfas supplementary table s13 were compiled across all sample ports of each column to quantitatively compare estimated bed lives among the tested columns fig 7 a summary of all calculated values and associated sample ports is presented in supplementary table s12 for all homologous series bv10 and bv50 values were positively associated with chain length gac bv10 values for br pfhps and br pfos were outliers to this trend which may have been artifacts of estimating initial breakthrough of low influent concentration c0 2 1 ng l gac bv10 values ranged from 2782 for ultrashort chain pfpra to 85 811 for pfos bv10 values ranged 3629 683 810 for pfpra to pfbs in aer1 and 4852 353 571 for pfpra to pfprs in aer2 breakthrough of longer chain pfsa did not occur in the duration of the study and were therefore at least 700 000 bvs between tested adsorbents bv10 values for the shortest chain pfca and fbsa 2 4 cf2 were comparable between gac and both aers aer bv10 values surpassed gac for pfhxa and were increasingly larger for longer chain pfca and all pfsa supplementary table s13 similarly aer bv50 values were greater for all compounds except ultrashort chain pfpra and pfba 2 3 cf2 these results agree with pilot results reported by mccleaf et al 2017 which showed greater aer bv10 values compared to gac for all pfsa and pfca with 5 cf2 in contrast bv50 bv10 ratios were lower for all compounds in gac 1 2 2 7 compared to either aer 1 4 4 9 supplementary table s13 describing steeper breakthrough curves for gac under the tested conditions steeper breakthrough curves indicate greater utilization of adsorbent capacity before initial breakthrough compared to more gradual breakthrough curves with mass transfer limitations practically greater bv10 values and adsorbent utilization may be achieved by increasing overall ebct through larger sized treatment vessels or multiple columns in series a lead lag configuration despite nominally different resin functionalities indicated by manufacturers aer1 complex amino groups and aer2 tributyl amino groups breakthrough characteristics were very similar fig 7b marginally longer bv values for aer2 supplementary table s13 can likely be attributed to operational variability from single replicate columns rather than true performance improvements correlating breakthrough performance with physical descriptors has potential utility to extrapolate data for compounds with unmeasured breakthrough in a treatment system using readily available log dow and lc retention time data both of which reflect hydrophobicity gac bv10 values showed reasonable linear association r2 of 0 80 and 0 76 respectively fig s15 however these had poor association for aer r2 0 24 for both adsorbents pfsa breakthrough was underpredicted and pfca overpredicted highlighting a limitation for hydrophobicity to account for differences between classes as previously mentioned in section 3 3 total negative molecular charge has been suggested as a descriptor capable of predicting adsorption to aers between classes park et al 2020a however these values require computationally intensive calculations to estimate nor have they been previously published for pfas given the ubiquity of homologous pfas series in contaminated waters and consistent differences in calculated hydrophobicities between homologs δlogd 0 7 per cf2 unit supplementary table s7 a simpler approach is to correlate class specific chain length with breakthrough in gac the relationship between breakthrough bv10 and bv50 and chain length for different classes was approximately linear r2 0 96 0 99 fig 7a interestingly the slopes of the linear correlations between different pfas classes were similar at each breakthrough level supplementary table s14 with an average increase in breakthrough bv of 12 806 and 21 440 per cf2 unit at bv10 and bv50 respectively even though the aer breakthrough data were more limited class specific breakthrough showed a log linear relationship r2 0 92 0 99 with chain length fig 7b slopes were nearly parallel between both aers and between pfas classes supplementary table s14 bv10 increased an average of 0 342 0 371 log per cf2 unit and bv50 0 391 0 399 log equivalent slopes between pfas classes indicate that adsorption affinity increases equally with cf2 addition independent of functional group mccleaf et al 2017 noted previously that percent pfas removal had a linear relationship with chain length in both gac and aer columns and that these trends were parallel between both pfca and pfsa which also supports this consistent additive effect equivalent slopes between both aers also suggest very similar functional characteristics between the aer1 and aer2 adsorbents an important characteristic of the chain length trends observed in this study is that they occurred despite differing individual influent homolog concentrations c0 micropollutants at trace concentrations e g ng l and low µg l range have been previously shown to follow linear isotherms in the presence of more abundant adsorbates e g mg l range nom indicating that equilibrium adsorption density increased proportionally with c0 at low concentrations graham et al 2000 knappe et al 1998 although pfas have been shown to follow nonlinear isotherms on gac and aer at an elevated concentration µg l mg l range boyer et al 2021 du et al 2015 pfas adsorption studies at trace concentrations have supported an independence of percent adsorption from initial concentrations mccleaf et al 2017 wang et al 2020 these concentration independent trends could be useful in approximating the bed lives of more strongly adsorbed pfas based on their shorter chain homologs when pilot runtime is limited for example bv10 relationship for 2 4 cf2 pfsa in aer1 can be leveraged to estimate initial breakthrough times for longer chain pfhxs and pfos to be on the order of 3 106 and 1 107 bvs respectively throughput values that could not reasonably be achieved in the timespan of the pilot fig 7b this could be particularly useful in estimating treatment performance in waters where long chain pfas predominate and drive treatment goals 3 8 practical considerations for adsorbent selection although nondimensionalized bvs provide a scalable performance comparison between adsorbents treatment selection must also consider costs related to adsorptive media usage during operation from a sizing perspective a gac treatment designed with 10 min ebct would require 4 times more media than an aer treatment designed with 2 5 min ebct for an equal volume of water this quantity difference may be offset partially by substantially higher bulk media costs of aers compared to gac franke et al 2021 murray et al 2021 supplier provided prices of aers in this pilot were on average 4 times greater than gac in 2021 and 3 times greater in 2022 on a bulk volume basis supplementary table s15 which approximately balances the differences in media volume spent adsorbent disposal or regeneration costs may vary substantially depending on local regulations but were estimated here and elsewhere franke et al 2021 to be comparable between adsorbent types capital costs such as treatment vessels pretreatment and pump systems may also substantially influence the lifetime cost of each treatment but they will vary greatly depending on design criteria supply chain and location operational costs are greatly impacted by media changeout frequency murray et al 2021 actual media service life before requiring changeout can provide important insight into the practical advantages of different technologies particularly when changeout costs are comparable estimated full scale service times bvs treated ebcteffluent of individual linear pfas were compared for all columns at media changeout thresholds of 10 and 50 breakthrough using bv data from section 3 7 fig 8 a times to 10 breakthrough of 2 4 cf2 pfca were under 142 days in gac and 61 days for aers indicating multiple media changeouts would be required every year to manage short chain pfca gac showed a service time advantage over aer for 10 breakthrough of short chain fbsa and 2 6 cf2 pfca however its advantage at 50 breakthrough was limited to fbsa and the shortest chain 2 4 cf2 pfca for longer pfca and all pfsa aer service times exceeded gac times to 10 breakthrough were at least 3 times greater in aers and were in excess of 1200 days for pfbs and longer chain compounds fig 8a under the current regulatory paradigm treatment goals are often dictated by a summative threshold concentration for multiple compounds in this pilot treatments were compared based on a weighed composite health based index hi equation s3 set by the minnesota department of health 2022 for six pfaa compounds ranging from 15 ng l pfos to 7 µg l pfba supplementary table s16 treatment bed service time was determined based on requisite media changeout after an hi value exceeded a value of 0 5 fig 8b applying only linear pfas concentrations to this hi service times for aer1 731 days and aer2 757 days were approximately 2 3 times higher than for gac 321 days highlighting a clear advantage of aers for minnesota s treatment goal notably the strong retention of short chain pfbs onto aers contributed most to their longer service life if incorporating both branched and linear pfas concentrations into the hi value fig 8b service times would decrease approximately 10 gac and over 8 aers the potential for branched isomers to substantially add to hi values and decrease service times highlights the need for explicit guidance on branched pfas quantitation in analytical methods and regulatory frameworks despite the observed advantages of aer for pfas removal there are other important factors that should be considered for adsorbent selection as noted in section 3 4 site specific water characteristics may have a large influence on the performances of aer and gac waters with elevated levels of hydrophobic nom and inorganic anions have been found to reduce pfas adsorption to different degrees through adsorption site competition and pore blocking appleman et al 2013 dixit et al 2019 2020 inorganic particulate and microbial growth can also clog pore space leading to increased column head loss and a reduction in usable bed life de vera et al 2019 an initial iteration of this pilot setup was aborted after 2 weeks due to iron and manganese particulate causing the system to over pressurize necessitating installation of a pretreatment system upstream of the pilot columns in the current study section s1 even with pretreatment head loss increased 2 6 3 4 fold over the duration of the pilot for all columns supplementary table s17 although microbial growth was not indicated to play a major role in this pilot due to low toc and nutrient concentrations biofouling may be a substantially greater issue in waters with higher organic loadings common mitigation measures to reduce backpressure and fouling for gac such as backwash and chemical oxidant addition de vera et al 2019 are not suitable for aers backwash is not recommended due to poor stratification of uniform resin beads leading to bed disruptions that can disturb bed mass transfer zones purolite 2021 this effect was visible in aer breakthrough curves when bed disruptions occurred fig 2 the gel aers used in this study also cannot be exposed to oxidants such as chlorine which can destroy resin and form nitrosamines purolite 2021 the high selectivity of aers for anionic pfas may limit their application in treating waters where diverse co contaminants also require treatment including nonionic and zwitterionic pfas wang et al 2020 in contrast gac is well suited to treat a wide range of organic co pollutants redding et al 2009 which may be valuable from a holistic water quality perspective the outcomes of this study highlight several important research needs most importantly there is a need for large scale continuous flow treatability data across a wider range of water chemistries pfas profiles and adsorbents standardized and transparent reporting of key design and performance metrics such as breakthrough times e g bv10 model parameters and background water quality can aid inter study comparisons and heuristics crucial to treatment design improvements furthermore developing validated methods to rapidly test and predict treatability of full scale systems in abbreviated timespans will aid more widespread continuous flow data collection pilot studies are very time and capital intensive robust sampling and analytical efforts are critical to yield sufficient breakthrough data that allow for a meaningful interpretation of the results fig 2a although techniques such as rapid small scale columns have begun to be tested for aers schaefer et al 2019 validation of scaling models to full scale data has yet to be achieved finally advances are needed in adsorptive treatment of abundant but poorly adsorbed short chain pfca such as pfba treatment processes that incorporate in situ aer regeneration which shows greatest efficacy in restoring capacity for short chain pfca liu and sun 2021 could be utilized to extend service times for these particularly challenging compounds 4 conclusions intermediate sample ports provided crucial sample data to comprehensively evaluate a long running pilot with low effluent breakthrough sample port data must be interpreted carefully as initial breakthrough can be underestimated at lower ebct sample port data provided a more robust estimation of half breakthrough which is reflective of equilibrium adsorption capacity molar mass balances across adsorbents revealed different adsorption behaviors gac displayed a clear finite capacity for total measured pfas and exhibited competitive replacement of short chain pfca with longer chain pfca and pfsa over the course of operation the aers reached a finite capacity for pfca but not pfsa in the duration of this study evidence of much greater pfsa selectivity with all influent pfas concentrations in the ng l range homologous series of pfca and pfsa followed quantitative relationships between chain length and breakthrough independent of their individual

15334,microplastics mps are considered one of the significant stratigraphic markers of the onset of the anthropocene epoch however the interconnections between historic plastic production waste management as well as social economic and timing of mp accumulation are not well understood here stratigraphic data of mps from a sediment core from xiamen bay china was used to reconstruct the history of plastic pollution generalized additive modeling indicates a complex temporal evolution of mp accumulation the oldest mps deposited in 1952 was 30 332 31 457 items kg dw coincide with the infancy of the plastic industry and onset of the anthropocene the cultural revolution 1966 1976 curtailed these initial increases subsequent rapid growth in mps during the late 1970s was peaked at 189 241 29 495 items kg dw in 1988 and was followed by a drastic decline in the late 1980s to a low value in 1996 16 626 26 371 items kg dw coinciding with proliferation of mp sources coupled with evolution of plastic production consumption and regulation increasing mps over the past decades implies that previous mitigation measures have been compromised by the escalated influx of mps from increasing plastics production legacy mps remaining in circulation and insufficient waste management for a growing population the present methodology and results represent a conceptual advance in understanding how changes in policy and economics over time correlate to changes in mp records in anthropocene strata which may help make decisions on plastic pollution mitigation strategies worldwide

recognized as a marine ecological hazard that had been apparent as early as the 1960s 1970s ryan 2015 plastic pollution has slowly become a global environmental concern since thompson et al 2004 coined the term microplastics mps finding them in plankton samples back to the 1960s and with subsequent increasing abundance over time mps range from 1 μm to 5 mm and include primary plastics such as microbeads or microfibers or secondary plastics formed by fragmention of macroplastics into smaller particles frias and nash 2019 in recent years mps have become considered a marker of the anthropocene epoch dating from the mid 20th century which closely coincides with the start of extensive plastic production zalasiewicz et al 2016 the significance of mps to the concept and understanding of the anthropocene has led to the suggestion of the time interval being alternatively named the plasticene haram et al 2020 the development of the plastic industry and waste management practices lau et al 2020 have driven the evolutionary history of plastic pollution by directly regulating its provenance but the extent to which it temporally correlates with changing human activities remains poorly understood brandon et al 2019 dong et al 2020 matsuguma et al 2017 turner et al 2019 wang et al 2018 there is therefore a pressing need to investigate the historical changes of plastic

bancone et al 2020 waters et al 2016 zalasiewicz et al 2016 will allow us to reconstruct the history of plastic pollution during the anthropocene recent global simulations of marine plastic transport indicate that at least 77 of buoyant marine plastic debris released from land based sources are trapped in coastal areas onink et al 2021 in the coastal zone mps tend to accumulate within low energy environments close to urbanized regions and anthropogenic sources ballent et al 2016 waters et al 2018 especially the coastal reserves around rapid urbanization which provide ideal natural archives for mp records detailed discussion in the section of sampling in supplementary information hereinafter si while mapping mp pollution history through coastal sediment is challenging due to multiple mechanisms controlling spatial and temporal distributions of mps and the time consuming and labor intensive procedure for extracting individual particles from environmental samples reliably leading to often biased and incomparable results löder et al 2015 some literature has discussed the effect of global plastic output on the temporal distribution of mps in coastal sediments brandon et al 2019 claessens et al 2011 martin et al 2020 matsuguma et al 2017 ostle et al 2019 wang et al 2018 but well known information about the multiple impacts of regional and local plastic production use and interventions to reduce plastic waste lau et al 2020 on anthropocene mp strata is scarce which hinders our understanding of the potential hazards and fate of marine mps beyond provenance the influence of the sedimentary environment on the mp records remains unclear and only a few studies have examined this issue notably that sediment grain size is a critical proxy for mp abundance at least for polymer types with higher densities when compared to seawater enders et al 2019 kane and clare 2019 strand et al 2013 therefore investigations on the collective mechanisms governing the potential historical inputs of mps to coastal settings are warranted here we collected marine sediment cores at xiamen bay and dated the deposition rate through 210pb and 137cs analysis using focal plane array micro fourier transform infrared fpa µftir to investigate the characteristics of mp records based on the analysis of the sedimentary environment we reconstructed the anthropocene mp succession since the 1950s meanwhile we identified and quantified the main responsible provenances of mps and established their changing abundance since 1950 we then discuss the interconnections between the mp records in anthropocene strata and historic plastic production waste management and socioeconomics through a general additive model the objective of this paper is to test the hypothesis that the depth distribution of mps in marine sediments is primarily controlled by the historic human activities related to plastics to evaluate the evolution of mp pollution during the anthropocene and to help formulate strategies for human interventions in mitigating plastic pollution 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling methodology xiamen bay of china fig 1 a typical east asian coastal bay was chosen as the study site since it is home to nearly 2000 marine species including protected species such as the little egret egretta garzetta as well as a vital part of the surrounding human socioeconomic development and approximately 76 67 of its plastic debris comes from human activities in the adjacent land chen et al 2019 the sediments in xiamen bay which come from the jiulong river adjacent land and the taiwan strait exhibit a wealth of terrestrial characteristics attributed to intensive human activities surrounding the bay fang et al 2010a e g the historical change in coastline and coastal land reclamation in recent decades fig 1 the surface sediment migration trajectory is shown in fig 1 and the historic patterns of runoff and sediment discharge from the jiulong river over the last 50 years are shown in fig s1 the salinity of xiamen bay is 26 to 30 with an average of 26 in the jiulong estuary controlled by tidal currents and freshwater upstream decreasing from east to west xiamen is one of china s four special economic zones and the largest coastal city near xiamen bay with the 7th and 14th highest container throughputs in china and the world respectively joc 2019 following china s economic reform and opening up that started in 1978 xiamen experienced a rapidly developing residential and industrial economy e g reclamation in fig 1 including the rise of the plastics industry in recent years the annual output of plastic products in xiamen has been beyond 2 0 105 tonnes and the competitiveness of the plastic industry has ranked first in fujian province for many years fujian enterprise information center 2017 the economic and industrial development record related to plastics in xiamen facilitated the assessment of field observations of mps in sediment cores in relation to historical human activities if the jiulong river is a major supplier of mps to the estuary one might expect mps to increase in the core at times of high runoff if it is not a large supplier of mps then conversely times of high sediment loads might be expected to result in dilution of the mps in the core at that time there is no evident systematic relationship between fig s1 and the mp abundance in fig 2 a suggesting that jiulong river didn t have an important contribution the population upstream juilong river is relatively small compared than that along the coast and xiamen city in addition there is inadequate data on mps from the catchment area of the jiulong river therefore plastic discharges from the upstream jiulong river were not considered herein four marine sediment cores were collected at xiamen bay using gravity corer with white polyvinyl chloride pvc tubes outer diameter φ 75 mm on march 18 2017 fig 1 si sampling and table s1 the cores were sealed immediately onsite using pvc end caps which were secured with electrical tape to keep the original state of the sediment with minimal interference and avoid potential atmospheric plastic contamination one of the sediment sites gy is situated in the middle zone of the jiulong estuary close to the jiyu nature reserve although near a wastewater effluent site fig 1 the vertical salinity in the gy core located area is sufficiently mixed and the stratification is not significant in the water column yu et al 2012 zhang et al 2008 sampling sites wy and hs were selected to avoid shipping lanes and are close to the undeveloped coastline with hs located farther out into the bay the characteristics of the sediment cores are shown in table s1 2 2 sampling treatment and core chronology in the laboratory pvc tubes were cut lengthwise using a core splitter geotek ltd uk and then a thin iron wire rinsed with ultrapure water was used to divide the sediment cores along the split line the integrity color change and physical appearance of the core profiles were recorded on july 21 24 2017 given unsuitable chronologies see below only the gy core was fully processed the integrity of the gy core was well retained the sediment was mainly gray argillaceous sand with coarse grained sand between 17 and 27 cm depth the top 1 m of the core was sliced into 1 cm samples while the remaining core was sliced into 2 cm samples using stainless steel cutters in which two aliquots were subsampled and preserved in aluminum foil bags preheated at 300 400 c with samples frozen before analysis note that the depths quoted in this study indicate the base of the 1 or 2 cm samples to prevent contamination the slicing process was performed on a clean laboratory bench the surface sediment was removed and then the undisturbed central portion of each layer was subsampled for mp analysis we did not observe any mps of the same white color as the pvc pipes additionally the spectral fingerprint of particles derived from the pvc pipe was recorded and no matched spectra were found within the mp particles these two results suggest that no traces of plastic particles from the pvc pipes contaminated the subsamples in undisturbed central portions of each core layer the grain size fig s4 and bulk density table s3 of the gy core was measured at 1 and 5 cm intervals using a laser particle analyzer malvern mastersizer 2000 u s a and volumetric flask method respectively the procedure of mp extraction from the sediment core is detailed in si mp sample treatment age models for three cores hs wy and gy were determined via measurement of 210pb activity li et al 2007 wu et al 2013 zeng et al 2015 hs 1 is dominated by medium and coarse sand table s1 and hence was unsuitable for 210pb dating the presence of 137cs in the sediment was measured on an ultralow background hpge spectrometer 0 26 cpm 40 2700 kev located in the china jinping underground laboratory cjpl at a depth of 2450 m wu et al 2013 zeng et al 2015 for details of dating please see si 210pb and 137cs dating fig s2 2 3 mp identification and quantification the abundance polymer composition and size of mps in the stratified sediment cores were characterized using fpa µftir see si mp identification and quantification fig s3 and table s5 this method is robust for unbiased high throughput detection of mps on the filter löder et al 2015 which greatly improves the accuracy of mp identification and the comparability of the results to evaluate the background contamination during the sample treatment and the fpa μftir measurement and recovery rates of the method here three blank samples and three spiked samples with polystyrene ps microspheres were randomly set up the mps averaged from the triplicate blank tests were used as background mp contamination si recovery rate and procedural blanks test table s6 from which the identified mps in stratified sediment samples were subtracted to yield the corrected mp numbers the method for the calculation of mp abundance and depositional flux is provided in the si mp abundance and depositional flux 2 4 the main sources of mps and the generalized additive model the major indicators of regional human activities in relation to macro and micro plastics si the main sources of mps were quantified through estimation of the registered population of xiamen city and annual gross domestic product gdp si economic and population growth in xiamen city fig s6 the land based plastic waste fluxes into the bay from xiamen city were estimated based upon per capita waste generation rates pcwgr and compared with income level changes with time fig s7a vessel sourced plastic debris was estimated based upon annual changes in cargo throughput to xiamen port the degree of containerization and the introduction of strengthened waste handling and disposal practices fig s8 wastewater derived mps were determined from estimates of urban wastewater generation volumes linked with residential populations and increasing construction of wastewater treatment plants wwtps after 1989 fig s9 a generalized additive model gam see si fig s10 table s8 is applied for different scenarios to explore the coupling relationships between the temporal evolution of mps and global national provincial fujian s and local xiamen s plastic production land and ship based plastic wastes and wastewater sourced mps 3 results 3 1 sediment core dating the 210pb activity of the investigated sediment cores is shown in fig s2 the 210pbtotal of the hs and wy cores do not decrease significantly indicating that they are greatly disturbed and cannot be accurately dated the 210pb in the hs 1 sediment core was not measured due to the dominance of the medium and coarse sand the sedimentation rate of gy is 0 49 0 04 cm yr in the top 50 cm 1916 2017 comparable to the published value in the same region in the 1990s of 0 43 cm yr li and li 1991 the 137cs radioactivity in the gy core is below the detection limit suggesting negligible 137cs deposition in this area since 137cs input from land freshwater oceanic currents or the atmosphere is small and unstable cai et al 1988 but the inputs of 210pb from the atmosphere are more stable the slight decadal variations in the sedimentation rate reflect a relatively stable depositional environment thus the gy core is chosen as the target column for this study although the sedimentation rate of gy may include uncertainties it can suggest an approximate time scale to aid the interpretation of the mp records 3 2 characteristics of mps 3 2 1 the abundance of mps a total of 1838 suspected mps were measured using fpa μftir of which 818 encompassing 16 polymer types table s5 were confirmed as mps in the gy core yielding a detection rate of 44 5 the earliest record of mps in the gy core appeared in the 32 cm layer corresponding to 1952 with 30 332 31 457 items kg dw figs 2a and s5 mp abundance declined significantly in sediments corresponding to the 1960s with 6911 23 294 items kg dw in 1968 in 1970s sediments mps increased to a peak abundance of 189 241 29 495 items kg dw in the mid 1980s subsequently they dropped abruptly in sediments dated from the late 1980s to a mid 1990s abundance of 16 626 26 371 items kg dw mp abundance fluctuates in sediment from the 1990s to the 2010s fig s5 3 2 2 the polymer types of mps sixteen types of polymers were detected of which pes mean 41 1 and acrylic 23 1 were dominant followed by pe pp pe pp and pa 20 figs 1b and 2a b phenolic was detected particularly between 40 and 32 cm depth 1952 1936 with a mean proportion of 6 1 meanwhile no phenolic compounds were detected in other layers except at 12 cm depth 1992 at 20 14 cm depth 1988 1976 pes accounted for 66 7 82 0 of the total mps 72 4 on average fig 3 b higher than the average proportion of pes 41 07 fig 3a throughout the entire core 3 2 3 the particle size of mps the particle size of mps spanned from 20 to 1355 μm for the whole gy core of which 82 2 were 100 μm fig 2c d the majority of mps were in the size range of 20 40 μm with sizes of 20 30 μm and 30 40 μm accounting for 20 3 and 19 7 respectively in particular mps of 20 40 μm seemed to accumulate in the 16 to 22 cm layers of the sediment core where there was an abundance of mps and a high fraction of pes was also found figs 1a b and 2b in particular in the 16 to 22 cm interval of the gy core the mps are characterized by high abundance 189 241 88 276 items kg dw and small particle size 30 40 μm figs 1a and 2d which suggests a comparatively stable hydrodynamic environment with little disturbance by extreme events in this region as in the estuarine environment the increased bed shear stress generated by the amplified hydrodynamic forcing of waves and currents before zou 2004 zou and hay 2003 during and after extreme events would have transported a bulk of mps leaving behind only a small amount of mps with larger particle sizes enders et al 2019 4 discussion 4 1 the sedimentary environment in xiamen bay the 210pbex activity profile in gy has maximum values immediately beneath the surface sediment 7 8 cm indicating that the top layer may have been disturbed by currents or through bio or anthro turbation another contributory factor could be the labile organic matter diluting the 210pbex on the top layer not yet reduced to the stable residues appleby and oldfield 1978 the sediment is dominated by coarse grain sizes at depths of 16 to 27 cm which might be assumed to be caused by changes in hydrodynamic conditions or extreme events fig s4 the sediment grain size changes gradually coarsening upwards in the depth interval of 27 to 23 cm and fining upwards between 17 and 13 cm depth c f red arrows in fig s4a the smooth variation in grain size indicates that the deposition is not related to a typhoon event which tends to generate a sharp based bed of coarser sand additionally the 210pb dating record shows that 210pbex at the layers of 14 to 15 cm 25 to 26 cm and 27 to 28 cm comply with the expected radiation decay rate fig s2 suggesting the stability of sedimentary accumulation rates the outliers of 210pbex c f data point 16 22 cm in fig s2 at the 15 to 16 cm and 21 to 22 cm depth intervals may be attributed to the high content of coarse grained sand fig s4 table s1 which has low adsorption capacity thereby increasing the chances of dilution of 210pbex appleby and oldfield 1978 typhoons are one of the most devastating natural extreme events in xiamen coastal areas such as typhoons meranti in 2016 0 5 cm depth dan in 1999 8 5 cm depth and pamela in 1961 ying et al 2014 27 5 cm depth directly hitting xiamen and wreaking catastrophic damage however these extreme events particularly typhoon meranti in 2016 did not cause significant changes in the surface sediment grain size fig s4e this suggests the stability of the sedimentary environment in the well sheltered study area consistent with a prior report concluding that hydrodynamics are somewhat weak and thus muddy deposition dominates in this area cai et al 1999 fang et al 2010a collectively the aforementioned evidence suggests little effect of hydrodynamics and extreme events e g typhoons on the observed distribution of coarse sediment grain size in the layer of 16 to 27 cm given that provenance and hydrodynamics are typically the most crucial controlling factors for sediment distribution patterns enders et al 2019 and having discounted the importance of hydrodynamics in the low energy study area we hypothesize that the provenance is the determining factor for the observed coarse sediment grain sizes at the sediment layer of 16 to 27 cm depth the sources of the sediments in xiamen bay exhibited a wealth of terrestrial characteristics fang et al 2010a fig 1 shows the surface sediment migration pattern in the gy area where sediments are transported westwards into the estuary north of the jiyu nature reserve and out of the estuary to xiamen bay south of the jiyu nature reserve and there is a convergence from three sediment transport pathways southwestward northeastward and eastward c f arrows in fig 1c cai et al 1999 fang et al 2010b zuo et al 2011 the mp in the study area was primarily affected by the population density and human activities around and within the bay before the 1960s below 27 cm depth the population density was low in xiamen bay and economic activity was weak fig s6b hence the sediments within the bay were hardly affected by the coastal human activities but were mainly influenced by the size selective sediment transport with a steady and long distance transport of small grains from the upstream jiulong river figs s3 and s5 from 1960 to the early 1970s 27 to 24 cm depth the still underdeveloped xiamen bay led to limited coastline change within the bay in 1955 1970 fig 1 and a gradual increase of grain size from 1970 to 1984 24 to 16 cm depth rapidly growing coastal development along xiamen bay fig 1 and a lack of environmental protection measures and awareness collectively enhanced the coastal supply of sediment these sediments are poorly sorted coarse grains accumulated in the study area causing as an abrupt change at 24 to 16 cm depth in the gy core fig s4 after the introduction of stricter environmental legislation in 1984 fig 2d the influx of nearshore sediments into the bay declined despite the growing coastal development such as reclamation in 1984 2017 fig 1 this human intervention facilitated a decrease in sediment grain size 16 to 13 cm deph and a stable provenance 13 to 0 cm deph fig s4 fig 4 a suggests that the correlation between high mp amounts and sand content is due to provenance surface sediment transport pattern and composition of terrestrial sediment near xiamen bay salt wedge circulation is one of the controlling factors in the spatial pattern of macro and micro plastics on the seafloor acha et al 2003 simon sánchez et al 2019 and the vertical distribution of mps in the water column in estuarine areas defontaine et al 2020 compared to the provenance and hydrodynamics in the study area the salt wedge is a secondary factor controlling the temporal distribution of mps in the gy sedimentary core 4 2 stratigraphic record of mps in xiamen bay the stratigraphic profiles of mps including abundance polymer types and sizes in the gy core are the result of the comprehensive action of the mp provenance physiochemical features and the sedimentary environment figs s6c and s6d show the decadal variations in mp abundance and depositional fluxes extracted from the stratigraphy of the gy core the onset of mp appearance in the sediments coincided with that of the plastics industry in china china plastics processing industry association 2002 and with the proposed onset of the anthropocene epoch waters et al 2016 small decadal changes in sedimentary mp abundance and depositional fluxes during the 1950 1960s are observed representing only small amounts of plastic entering the coast due to limited plastic production and an undeveloped consumer lifestyle with a low demand for plastic products fig 2c in contrast large mp abundance and depositional fluxes are observed during the 1970 1980s due to rapid economic development population expansion and plastic industry growth in the late 1980s and early 1990s sedimentary mp abundance and depositional fluxes underwent abrupt declines due to mitigation actions to tackle plastic pollution worldwide including the implementation of the marine plastic pollution research and control act marpol for the prevention of pollution from ships however with time the decline was gradually overcome by the accelerated population and plastic industry growth and modern consumer lifestyle that demands a myriad of plastic products the mp abundance in the gy core has been rising slowly again since the 1990s but at a rate less than that witnessed in the 1970s and early 1980s it is possible that benefits from the marpol annex v in 1988 and domestic environmental protection measures were counteracted by the sharp increase in domestic plastic output during the 1990s at an average annual rate of 15 34 anonymity 2007 the high fractions of pes and acrylic in the gy core are consistent with earlier studies showing that pes or acrylic pes copolymers permeate in the subsurface ocean and deep sea sediment and account for a large proportion of the detected mps kanhai et al 2017 woodall et al 2014 the densities of pure pes and acrylic are 1 38 1 40 and 1 18 1 19 g cm3 respectively greater than the seawater density so they tend to sink to the seabed in contrast despite considerably higher production than other polymer types pe and pp are buoyant and typically found at the water surface or in the water column due to their low densities compared to sea water 0 91 0 97 g cm3 and 0 89 0 91 g cm3 for pe and pp respectively however some pe pp and pe pp copolymers can be found in the gy core possibly due to increased densities and reduced re suspension due to colonization of biofouling that facilitates their sinking and settling into the sediment chubarenko et al 2016 clark et al 2016 corcoran et al 2015 kaiser et al 2017 lusher et al 2015 semcesen and wells 2021 van cauwenberghe et al 2013 zhao et al 2017 fig 4 shows that the mp abundance has a significant positive correlation with the proportion of sand components in the sediments which is consistent with the earlier results that high density mps revealed strong correlations with fine sand enders et al 2019 and smaller mps facilitated settling than larger ones under constant environmental conditions semcesen and wells 2021 however mp abundance was inversely correlated with silt and clay concentrations suggesting similar sedimentation behavior of mps and sand but different behaviors of mps with silt and clay the deposition of mps has been studied in recent years defontaine et al 2020 semcesen and wells 2021 yet the potential mp sediment relationship remains unclear enders et al 2019 kane and clare 2019 the sedimentation of mps is different from that of natural particulates even under the same hydrodynamic conditions due to the low density of their constituent polymers hydrophobicity neutrality and corrosion resistance browne et al 2011 waldschläger and schüttrumpf 2019 therefore the empirical rules of natural particulate deposition may not be applicable to mps for example flocculation of clay was limited during mp deposition browne et al 2010 although the distribution and accumulation of mps in marine sediment are influenced by various factors eerkes medrano et al 2015 sources and hydrodynamic regime have been identified as controlling factors enders et al 2019 the distribution of mps and their correlation with natural particulates in the profile of the gy core mirror the varying composition and intensity of mp sources in the different time intervals under a comparatively stable deposition environment considering the surface sediment migration trend in the study area and the fractionation of mps during the depositional process due to differences in physicochemical properties size and density that small sized and high density mps deposited closer to their sources relative to large size and low density ones defontaine et al 2020 semcesen and wells 2021 we believe that the main controlling factors come from the nearshore of xiamen bay rather than through variation in discharges from the jiulong river 4 3 mps and plastic production from the historical profile of mps in the gy core plastic pollution occurred in the early stage of plastic production and consumption in the region plastic waste may enter the environment coincidental with production e g nurdles but the mass of particulate plastic entering an estuarine marine environment comes following use and disposal with a delay caused by indirect transport pathways involving repeated deposition and re working before final burial the mp concentration increased with time in parallel with increased global plastic production brandon et al 2019 dong et al 2020 matsuguma et al 2017 turner et al 2019 wang et al 2018 xue et al 2020 but local contributions e g local plastic production have often been ignored fig 5 shows the historical evolution of sedimentary mps versus plastic production at local regional and global scales between 1950 and 1984 mps were closely correlated with global and china s plastic production despite a global annual increase in plastic production china contributed a limited share of global plastic outputs during this time fig 2c mps in the core therefore appear to link more closely with global plastic production trends the sporadic development of the plastic industry in fujian province and xiamen city yields a weak association of sedimentary mps with regional plastic production between 1988 and 2012 however mps were more related to local plastic production than to provincial or national plastic production a sharp decline in the mps was remarkable from 1984 to 1996 fig 2a despite growing plastic production hence the observed stratigraphic record of the temporal distribution of mps reflected exogenous sources of plastics up to 1984 and local sources from 1988 onwards fishing ropes are considered internationally to be an important source of mps xue et al 2020 but fishing in xiamen bay during recent decades has not been significant gam modeling results show that mps increased nonlinearly with increasing xiamen s plastic output but the confidence intervals increased as well fig 6 a this result suggests that local plastic production was not a major contributor to mps in the marine sediment and that other contributory factors e g plastic waste from upstream cities and local sedimentation patterns account for the primary temporal changes in mps recorded in the sediment core comparison of mps and production rates only provide a component of the story a potentially significant correlation to investigate if not least due to the abundance of production data compared with historical usage and waste management practices the evolution of mp composition with time fig 2b echoes the temporal variation patterns of plastic production and consumption fig 2c although the earliest report of a phenolic production plant in china was from shanghai in 1930 china plastics processing industry association 2002 details on phenolic output scale and distribution are still lacking the mass product usage of plastics in china started in the early 1950s when phenolics were the major plastic product in 1955 china had only 703 small sized plastic companies 80 of which were phenolic plastic manufacturers thus thermoplastics such as pe and pp were mainly imported china plastics processing industry association 2002 phenolic as one type of early plastic product may provide a useful marker for the latest holocene succession i e pre anthropocene however the deposition records of phenolics pre 1952 were not discussed in this study because the available literature is insufficient to expand upon the interpretation of the observed data it is meaningless to discuss this further without sufficient literature support it is generally believed that the onset of the anthropocene coincides with the great acceleration in the 1950s steffen et al 2015 waters et al 2016 and plastic as one of the significant stratigraphic markers of the anthropocene developed during this time in china the literature and data records related to plastics have been gradually enriched from this interval therefore the historical records of mps in the anthropocene stratigraphy and the literature after 1952 can be mutually corroborated to a certain extent the great proletarian cultural revolution 1966 to 1976 in china led to the stagnation of nearly all industries including the manufacture of plastics this may explain why mps increased in the 1950s followed by a downturn in the 1960s although with the lowest concentrations in 1964 fig 2a predating this social stagnation plastic pollution is affected not only by plastic production but also by the type of plastic products and technology development china s economic reform and opening up which started in 1978 facilitated the recovery of the plastic industry for instance during 1978 to 1984 china implemented 170 technological upgrading projects to replace wood with plastics china plastics processing industry association 2002 the explosive growth and a lack of environmental facilities and policies led to enormous emissions of plastic waste which may have resulted in the rapid surge in the mps in the 1970s and a peak of mps in 1984 fig 2a the predominance of pes from 1968 to 1988 fig 2b may be explained by the thriving international imports of the plastics industry during the 1970s to1980s when pes was in large demand due to its popularity as clothing material and after 1976 for a growing chinese demand for fashion the types of plastic products are diverse to meet the needs of not only people s daily lives but also industry requirements china plastics processing industry association 2002 xiamen special economic zone yearbook editorial board 1986 from the 1990s when there was an acceleration of plastic production nationally and locally in xiamen fig 2c the export oriented plastic production and extended plastic lifetime not only significantly reduced the discharge of plastics into the ocean fig 2a but also reflected changes in the nature of plastic consumption pes decreased markedly after 1988 and the proportion of acrylic varied markedly from 86 of mps in 1996 to absent in 2004 table s5 while pe pp abs and pe pp at various times increased in concentrations suggesting the enhanced diversity of mp polymer types due to changes in the plastic industry in xiamen fig 2b pe pp and pvc were produced massively for construction packaging and daily life during that time foreign advanced plastic production technology and machinery introduced to xiamen in 1984 included the production of pp woven bags pvc food grade cling film pvc corrugated pipes and plastic sheets xiamen special economic zone yearbook editorial board 1986 although pvc is not a significant component in the gy core after 1984 4 4 mps and plastic waste regulations changes in plastic waste regulation also explain some of the fluctuations in historical mp records in xiamen bay marine sediments fig 6b shows that mps in the gy core correlate with the net flux of land based plastic debris into the sea p 0 16 suggesting the key role of control measures of terrestrial waste to offshore sedimentary mps the generated municipal solid waste msw in xiamen increased from 9 0 104 to 1 9 106 metric tons tonnes between 1950 and 2016 fig s7c during which plastic waste increased from 360 to 2 1 105 tonnes fig s7e however the volume of land based plastic debris discarded did not follow an upwards trend pink line in fig 1d see also s8e s8f this was due to the improved management of msw after 1980 which resulted in more msw being collected than discarded from 1985 fig s7d counting the increased global recycling and incineration rates of plastic waste geyer et al 2017 and strengthening environmental legislation in xiamen city after the 1980s the amount of plastic debris discarded onto the land and ultimately dumped into the sea fluctuated but remained broadly constant shown by blue and green lines in fig 2d respectively see si land based plastic fluxes into xiamen bay for details furthermore since 1996 marine debris most plastic debris has been routinely collected along xiamen s 52 km2 coastline su et al 2011 approximately 184 tonnes of marine debris were collected each month from the sea surface of xiamen bay between 2009 and 2018 xiamen marine and fisheries bureau 2018 the mitigation efforts for plastic pollution have greatly slowed the growth rate of the net flux of land based plastic debris into the sea despite an overall increase from 160 tonnes in 1950 to 4884 tonnes in 2016 brown line in fig 2d the proportion of plastic waste influx to the sea compared with the generated plastic waste has decreased from 43 7 to 2 32 the effectiveness of regulatory efforts to reduce plastic pollution however has been overpowered by plastic production and consumption leading to the massive accumulation of plastic waste in regional marine environments lau et al 2020 ship derived litter is a major source of plastic pollution in the ocean hagen 1990 horsman 1982 ryan et al 2019 however quantifying the volume of ship generated plastic debris is challenging cantin et al 1990 here we estimated the input of non container ship based plastic debris to xiamen bay assuming three settings of reduced discharges fig 2e see si vessel source plastic debris to xiamen bay using gam simulation we found that ship littering played a role in marine sediment mps fig 6c particularly before 1989 the mps in the gy core showed a positive correlation between increased ship based plastic waste littering and rising cargo throughput in xiamen port fig s8c despite the rapid development of xiamen port between 1989 and 2018 the cargo throughput increased by 42 times plastic waste from ships entering the sea has not increased concomitantly and at times has shown rapid declines this may be due to the rapid development of containerization in xiamen port after 1983 the container throughput of xiamen port grew by 29 5 per annum from 3300 to 1 07 107 teu twenty foot equivalent unit between 1983 and 2018 fig s8a accounting for 2 1 to 83 6 of the total port throughput respectively xiamen municipal bureau of statistics 2019 nearly all garbage from container cargo is disposed onshore and thus the rapid development of containerization resulted in a sharp decline in ship plastic littering cantin et al 1990 additionally the laws and regulations banning ship plastic waste further reduced the vessel source marine litter process china started to enforce the marine environment protection law in 1983 which prevented vessel based waste dumping the world bank 1992 subsequently china s regulation of control over dumping wastes into the sea was enforced in 1985 food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2019 marpol annex v prohibiting direct marine plastic debris dumping came into force in 1988 ninaber 1997 sheavly and register 2007 although the legal validity of marpol is still controversial a large number of studies have documented its effectiveness in reducing plastic waste from ships into the ocean cantin et al 1990 edyvane et al 2004 johnson 1994 xiamen is one of the first six ports in china to establish onshore ship generated waste reception and handling facilities the world bank 1992 the gam simulation results fig s9 table s8 also showed that the number of ships that achieved zero emissions of plastic waste after 1989 may be closer to the real scenario suggesting successful implementation of marpol annex v in xiamen port the rigorous enforcement of annex v as well as national and regional environmental laws and regulations collectively bar the direct dumping of ship generated plastic waste in xiamen bay and emissions are modeled as zero by 2016 fig 2e fig 6d confirms that municipal wastewater was one of the main contributors to historical marine mp pollution before 1989 lacking wastewater treatment plants wwtps in xiamen untreated urban wastewater was directly discharged into the coast providing an estimated mp influx of 4 4 6 1 1013 items yr to xiamen bay during 1950to 1989 fig s9b especially during 1980 to 1989 the mass production and use of pes collectively led to the large discharge flux of wastewater based mps which may be one of the main reasons for the observed peak of mps in marine sediments during that period from 1989 with the establishment of wwtps in xiamen the wastewater treatment rate changed from 18 2 to 96 02 between 1989 and 2018 preventing 1 38 1013 to 1 97 1014 items 20 9 87 4 of mps from flowing into the sea each year the green part in fig s9b assuming the absence of wwtps and other sources we estimate that the abundance of mps in sediment would reach 2 2 105 and 3 2 105 items kg dw in 2012 and 2018 respectively one order of magnitude higher than the current values despite the important role of wwtps in reducing marine mp pollution we cannot neglect the mp outputs from continuous wastewater effluent emissions long et al 2019 5 conclusion the evolution of plastic production use and waste management is recorded by the temporal variations in the abundance size distribution and chemical composition of mps in a marine sediment core from xiamen bay the stratigraphic profile of mps is the result of the combined influence of multiple factors including mp provenances physicochemical properties and sedimentation environment their appearance and abundance provide a useful marker for recognizing the mid 20th century beginning of the anthropocene epoch and component anthropocene strata through to the present day local populations started to commonly use plastic for example the onset of nonphenolic mps in the sediment core c f 1952 despite no known local production source at that time despite the production of plastic at the global to national scales showing an accelerating curve since 1950 the sedimentary record of mp abundance may be used as potential chronostratigraphic horizons a dip in 1960s values is considered to result from the effects of the cultural revolution in china and a peak value in the mid 1980s following the political drive for industrialization mp abundance has declined rapidly since the late 1980s through improved management of municipal solid waste on land introduction of wastewater treatment plants and regulation of plastic waste discarding by ships over the past two decades mp pollution has started to slowly rise again combined with the evidence of stratigraphic data targeted measures are clearly necessary including banning nonessential and single use plastics efficient waste management and plastic removal to mitigate mp pollution and to lessen the impacts of development in the anthropocene the potential uncertainty associated with the chronology of the gy core in this study may be reduced by adopting a more robust sediment core chronology to link socioeconomic patterns of plastic production use and waste management with mp stratigraphic record in future research it was assumed that mps remained stable without significant geochemical changes and vertical migration once they were buried in sediments and taphonomic processes should be considered to extract the historical mp records for future studies bancone et al 2020 although mps have been recognized as an anthropocene marker the longevity and potential fragmentation of mps in sediments are not well understood waters et al 2018 the deposition of mps from water column to seabed the resuspension and burial and aggregation of mps under the action of turbulence and ambient flow play an important role in mp distribution in the sediment core especially in high energy environments peng et al 2018 waldschläger and schüttrumpf 2019 also worth further investigation in low energy coastal environments close to urban and industrial areas such as the present study area however sources are the most critical influencing factor on the long term trend of mps in marine sediment due to the complexity of human and natural activities in coastal areas the sources of mps in marine sediments are diverse and uncertain and not fully understood the regional and global applicability of mps as markers of the anthropocene epoch shall be investigated through global collaborative efforts credit authorship

15334,microplastics mps are considered one of the significant stratigraphic markers of the onset of the anthropocene epoch however the interconnections between historic plastic production waste management as well as social economic and timing of mp accumulation are not well understood here stratigraphic data of mps from a sediment core from xiamen bay china was used to reconstruct the history of plastic pollution generalized additive modeling indicates a complex temporal evolution of mp accumulation the oldest mps deposited in 1952 was 30 332 31 457 items kg dw coincide with the infancy of the plastic industry and onset of the anthropocene the cultural revolution 1966 1976 curtailed these initial increases subsequent rapid growth in mps during the late 1970s was peaked at 189 241 29 495 items kg dw in 1988 and was followed by a drastic decline in the late 1980s to a low value in 1996 16 626 26 371 items kg dw coinciding with proliferation of mp sources coupled with evolution of plastic production consumption and regulation increasing mps over the past decades implies that previous mitigation measures have been compromised by the escalated influx of mps from increasing plastics production legacy mps remaining in circulation and insufficient waste management for a growing population the present methodology and results represent a conceptual advance in understanding how changes in policy and economics over time correlate to changes in mp records in anthropocene strata which may help make decisions on plastic pollution mitigation strategies worldwide

recognized as a marine ecological hazard that had been apparent as early as the 1960s 1970s ryan 2015 plastic pollution has slowly become a global environmental concern since thompson et al 2004 coined the term microplastics mps finding them in plankton samples back to the 1960s and with subsequent increasing abundance over time mps range from 1 μm to 5 mm and include primary plastics such as microbeads or microfibers or secondary plastics formed by fragmention of macroplastics into smaller particles frias and nash 2019 in recent years mps have become considered a marker of the anthropocene epoch dating from the mid 20th century which closely coincides with the start of extensive plastic production zalasiewicz et al 2016 the significance of mps to the concept and understanding of the anthropocene has led to the suggestion of the time interval being alternatively named the plasticene haram et al 2020 the development of the plastic industry and waste management practices lau et al 2020 have driven the evolutionary history of plastic pollution by directly regulating its provenance but the extent to which it temporally correlates with changing human activities remains poorly understood brandon et al 2019 dong et al 2020 matsuguma et al 2017 turner et al 2019 wang et al 2018 there is therefore a pressing need to investigate the historical changes of plastic

bancone et al 2020 waters et al 2016 zalasiewicz et al 2016 will allow us to reconstruct the history of plastic pollution during the anthropocene recent global simulations of marine plastic transport indicate that at least 77 of buoyant marine plastic debris released from land based sources are trapped in coastal areas onink et al 2021 in the coastal zone mps tend to accumulate within low energy environments close to urbanized regions and anthropogenic sources ballent et al 2016 waters et al 2018 especially the coastal reserves around rapid urbanization which provide ideal natural archives for mp records detailed discussion in the section of sampling in supplementary information hereinafter si while mapping mp pollution history through coastal sediment is challenging due to multiple mechanisms controlling spatial and temporal distributions of mps and the time consuming and labor intensive procedure for extracting individual particles from environmental samples reliably leading to often biased and incomparable results löder et al 2015 some literature has discussed the effect of global plastic output on the temporal distribution of mps in coastal sediments brandon et al 2019 claessens et al 2011 martin et al 2020 matsuguma et al 2017 ostle et al 2019 wang et al 2018 but well known information about the multiple impacts of regional and local plastic production use and interventions to reduce plastic waste lau et al 2020 on anthropocene mp strata is scarce which hinders our understanding of the potential hazards and fate of marine mps beyond provenance the influence of the sedimentary environment on the mp records remains unclear and only a few studies have examined this issue notably that sediment grain size is a critical proxy for mp abundance at least for polymer types with higher densities when compared to seawater enders et al 2019 kane and clare 2019 strand et al 2013 therefore investigations on the collective mechanisms governing the potential historical inputs of mps to coastal settings are warranted here we collected marine sediment cores at xiamen bay and dated the deposition rate through 210pb and 137cs analysis using focal plane array micro fourier transform infrared fpa µftir to investigate the characteristics of mp records based on the analysis of the sedimentary environment we reconstructed the anthropocene mp succession since the 1950s meanwhile we identified and quantified the main responsible provenances of mps and established their changing abundance since 1950 we then discuss the interconnections between the mp records in anthropocene strata and historic plastic production waste management and socioeconomics through a general additive model the objective of this paper is to test the hypothesis that the depth distribution of mps in marine sediments is primarily controlled by the historic human activities related to plastics to evaluate the evolution of mp pollution during the anthropocene and to help formulate strategies for human interventions in mitigating plastic pollution 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling methodology xiamen bay of china fig 1 a typical east asian coastal bay was chosen as the study site since it is home to nearly 2000 marine species including protected species such as the little egret egretta garzetta as well as a vital part of the surrounding human socioeconomic development and approximately 76 67 of its plastic debris comes from human activities in the adjacent land chen et al 2019 the sediments in xiamen bay which come from the jiulong river adjacent land and the taiwan strait exhibit a wealth of terrestrial characteristics attributed to intensive human activities surrounding the bay fang et al 2010a e g the historical change in coastline and coastal land reclamation in recent decades fig 1 the surface sediment migration trajectory is shown in fig 1 and the historic patterns of runoff and sediment discharge from the jiulong river over the last 50 years are shown in fig s1 the salinity of xiamen bay is 26 to 30 with an average of 26 in the jiulong estuary controlled by tidal currents and freshwater upstream decreasing from east to west xiamen is one of china s four special economic zones and the largest coastal city near xiamen bay with the 7th and 14th highest container throughputs in china and the world respectively joc 2019 following china s economic reform and opening up that started in 1978 xiamen experienced a rapidly developing residential and industrial economy e g reclamation in fig 1 including the rise of the plastics industry in recent years the annual output of plastic products in xiamen has been beyond 2 0 105 tonnes and the competitiveness of the plastic industry has ranked first in fujian province for many years fujian enterprise information center 2017 the economic and industrial development record related to plastics in xiamen facilitated the assessment of field observations of mps in sediment cores in relation to historical human activities if the jiulong river is a major supplier of mps to the estuary one might expect mps to increase in the core at times of high runoff if it is not a large supplier of mps then conversely times of high sediment loads might be expected to result in dilution of the mps in the core at that time there is no evident systematic relationship between fig s1 and the mp abundance in fig 2 a suggesting that jiulong river didn t have an important contribution the population upstream juilong river is relatively small compared than that along the coast and xiamen city in addition there is inadequate data on mps from the catchment area of the jiulong river therefore plastic discharges from the upstream jiulong river were not considered herein four marine sediment cores were collected at xiamen bay using gravity corer with white polyvinyl chloride pvc tubes outer diameter φ 75 mm on march 18 2017 fig 1 si sampling and table s1 the cores were sealed immediately onsite using pvc end caps which were secured with electrical tape to keep the original state of the sediment with minimal interference and avoid potential atmospheric plastic contamination one of the sediment sites gy is situated in the middle zone of the jiulong estuary close to the jiyu nature reserve although near a wastewater effluent site fig 1 the vertical salinity in the gy core located area is sufficiently mixed and the stratification is not significant in the water column yu et al 2012 zhang et al 2008 sampling sites wy and hs were selected to avoid shipping lanes and are close to the undeveloped coastline with hs located farther out into the bay the characteristics of the sediment cores are shown in table s1 2 2 sampling treatment and core chronology in the laboratory pvc tubes were cut lengthwise using a core splitter geotek ltd uk and then a thin iron wire rinsed with ultrapure water was used to divide the sediment cores along the split line the integrity color change and physical appearance of the core profiles were recorded on july 21 24 2017 given unsuitable chronologies see below only the gy core was fully processed the integrity of the gy core was well retained the sediment was mainly gray argillaceous sand with coarse grained sand between 17 and 27 cm depth the top 1 m of the core was sliced into 1 cm samples while the remaining core was sliced into 2 cm samples using stainless steel cutters in which two aliquots were subsampled and preserved in aluminum foil bags preheated at 300 400 c with samples frozen before analysis note that the depths quoted in this study indicate the base of the 1 or 2 cm samples to prevent contamination the slicing process was performed on a clean laboratory bench the surface sediment was removed and then the undisturbed central portion of each layer was subsampled for mp analysis we did not observe any mps of the same white color as the pvc pipes additionally the spectral fingerprint of particles derived from the pvc pipe was recorded and no matched spectra were found within the mp particles these two results suggest that no traces of plastic particles from the pvc pipes contaminated the subsamples in undisturbed central portions of each core layer the grain size fig s4 and bulk density table s3 of the gy core was measured at 1 and 5 cm intervals using a laser particle analyzer malvern mastersizer 2000 u s a and volumetric flask method respectively the procedure of mp extraction from the sediment core is detailed in si mp sample treatment age models for three cores hs wy and gy were determined via measurement of 210pb activity li et al 2007 wu et al 2013 zeng et al 2015 hs 1 is dominated by medium and coarse sand table s1 and hence was unsuitable for 210pb dating the presence of 137cs in the sediment was measured on an ultralow background hpge spectrometer 0 26 cpm 40 2700 kev located in the china jinping underground laboratory cjpl at a depth of 2450 m wu et al 2013 zeng et al 2015 for details of dating please see si 210pb and 137cs dating fig s2 2 3 mp identification and quantification the abundance polymer composition and size of mps in the stratified sediment cores were characterized using fpa µftir see si mp identification and quantification fig s3 and table s5 this method is robust for unbiased high throughput detection of mps on the filter löder et al 2015 which greatly improves the accuracy of mp identification and the comparability of the results to evaluate the background contamination during the sample treatment and the fpa μftir measurement and recovery rates of the method here three blank samples and three spiked samples with polystyrene ps microspheres were randomly set up the mps averaged from the triplicate blank tests were used as background mp contamination si recovery rate and procedural blanks test table s6 from which the identified mps in stratified sediment samples were subtracted to yield the corrected mp numbers the method for the calculation of mp abundance and depositional flux is provided in the si mp abundance and depositional flux 2 4 the main sources of mps and the generalized additive model the major indicators of regional human activities in relation to macro and micro plastics si the main sources of mps were quantified through estimation of the registered population of xiamen city and annual gross domestic product gdp si economic and population growth in xiamen city fig s6 the land based plastic waste fluxes into the bay from xiamen city were estimated based upon per capita waste generation rates pcwgr and compared with income level changes with time fig s7a vessel sourced plastic debris was estimated based upon annual changes in cargo throughput to xiamen port the degree of containerization and the introduction of strengthened waste handling and disposal practices fig s8 wastewater derived mps were determined from estimates of urban wastewater generation volumes linked with residential populations and increasing construction of wastewater treatment plants wwtps after 1989 fig s9 a generalized additive model gam see si fig s10 table s8 is applied for different scenarios to explore the coupling relationships between the temporal evolution of mps and global national provincial fujian s and local xiamen s plastic production land and ship based plastic wastes and wastewater sourced mps 3 results 3 1 sediment core dating the 210pb activity of the investigated sediment cores is shown in fig s2 the 210pbtotal of the hs and wy cores do not decrease significantly indicating that they are greatly disturbed and cannot be accurately dated the 210pb in the hs 1 sediment core was not measured due to the dominance of the medium and coarse sand the sedimentation rate of gy is 0 49 0 04 cm yr in the top 50 cm 1916 2017 comparable to the published value in the same region in the 1990s of 0 43 cm yr li and li 1991 the 137cs radioactivity in the gy core is below the detection limit suggesting negligible 137cs deposition in this area since 137cs input from land freshwater oceanic currents or the atmosphere is small and unstable cai et al 1988 but the inputs of 210pb from the atmosphere are more stable the slight decadal variations in the sedimentation rate reflect a relatively stable depositional environment thus the gy core is chosen as the target column for this study although the sedimentation rate of gy may include uncertainties it can suggest an approximate time scale to aid the interpretation of the mp records 3 2 characteristics of mps 3 2 1 the abundance of mps a total of 1838 suspected mps were measured using fpa μftir of which 818 encompassing 16 polymer types table s5 were confirmed as mps in the gy core yielding a detection rate of 44 5 the earliest record of mps in the gy core appeared in the 32 cm layer corresponding to 1952 with 30 332 31 457 items kg dw figs 2a and s5 mp abundance declined significantly in sediments corresponding to the 1960s with 6911 23 294 items kg dw in 1968 in 1970s sediments mps increased to a peak abundance of 189 241 29 495 items kg dw in the mid 1980s subsequently they dropped abruptly in sediments dated from the late 1980s to a mid 1990s abundance of 16 626 26 371 items kg dw mp abundance fluctuates in sediment from the 1990s to the 2010s fig s5 3 2 2 the polymer types of mps sixteen types of polymers were detected of which pes mean 41 1 and acrylic 23 1 were dominant followed by pe pp pe pp and pa 20 figs 1b and 2a b phenolic was detected particularly between 40 and 32 cm depth 1952 1936 with a mean proportion of 6 1 meanwhile no phenolic compounds were detected in other layers except at 12 cm depth 1992 at 20 14 cm depth 1988 1976 pes accounted for 66 7 82 0 of the total mps 72 4 on average fig 3 b higher than the average proportion of pes 41 07 fig 3a throughout the entire core 3 2 3 the particle size of mps the particle size of mps spanned from 20 to 1355 μm for the whole gy core of which 82 2 were 100 μm fig 2c d the majority of mps were in the size range of 20 40 μm with sizes of 20 30 μm and 30 40 μm accounting for 20 3 and 19 7 respectively in particular mps of 20 40 μm seemed to accumulate in the 16 to 22 cm layers of the sediment core where there was an abundance of mps and a high fraction of pes was also found figs 1a b and 2b in particular in the 16 to 22 cm interval of the gy core the mps are characterized by high abundance 189 241 88 276 items kg dw and small particle size 30 40 μm figs 1a and 2d which suggests a comparatively stable hydrodynamic environment with little disturbance by extreme events in this region as in the estuarine environment the increased bed shear stress generated by the amplified hydrodynamic forcing of waves and currents before zou 2004 zou and hay 2003 during and after extreme events would have transported a bulk of mps leaving behind only a small amount of mps with larger particle sizes enders et al 2019 4 discussion 4 1 the sedimentary environment in xiamen bay the 210pbex activity profile in gy has maximum values immediately beneath the surface sediment 7 8 cm indicating that the top layer may have been disturbed by currents or through bio or anthro turbation another contributory factor could be the labile organic matter diluting the 210pbex on the top layer not yet reduced to the stable residues appleby and oldfield 1978 the sediment is dominated by coarse grain sizes at depths of 16 to 27 cm which might be assumed to be caused by changes in hydrodynamic conditions or extreme events fig s4 the sediment grain size changes gradually coarsening upwards in the depth interval of 27 to 23 cm and fining upwards between 17 and 13 cm depth c f red arrows in fig s4a the smooth variation in grain size indicates that the deposition is not related to a typhoon event which tends to generate a sharp based bed of coarser sand additionally the 210pb dating record shows that 210pbex at the layers of 14 to 15 cm 25 to 26 cm and 27 to 28 cm comply with the expected radiation decay rate fig s2 suggesting the stability of sedimentary accumulation rates the outliers of 210pbex c f data point 16 22 cm in fig s2 at the 15 to 16 cm and 21 to 22 cm depth intervals may be attributed to the high content of coarse grained sand fig s4 table s1 which has low adsorption capacity thereby increasing the chances of dilution of 210pbex appleby and oldfield 1978 typhoons are one of the most devastating natural extreme events in xiamen coastal areas such as typhoons meranti in 2016 0 5 cm depth dan in 1999 8 5 cm depth and pamela in 1961 ying et al 2014 27 5 cm depth directly hitting xiamen and wreaking catastrophic damage however these extreme events particularly typhoon meranti in 2016 did not cause significant changes in the surface sediment grain size fig s4e this suggests the stability of the sedimentary environment in the well sheltered study area consistent with a prior report concluding that hydrodynamics are somewhat weak and thus muddy deposition dominates in this area cai et al 1999 fang et al 2010a collectively the aforementioned evidence suggests little effect of hydrodynamics and extreme events e g typhoons on the observed distribution of coarse sediment grain size in the layer of 16 to 27 cm given that provenance and hydrodynamics are typically the most crucial controlling factors for sediment distribution patterns enders et al 2019 and having discounted the importance of hydrodynamics in the low energy study area we hypothesize that the provenance is the determining factor for the observed coarse sediment grain sizes at the sediment layer of 16 to 27 cm depth the sources of the sediments in xiamen bay exhibited a wealth of terrestrial characteristics fang et al 2010a fig 1 shows the surface sediment migration pattern in the gy area where sediments are transported westwards into the estuary north of the jiyu nature reserve and out of the estuary to xiamen bay south of the jiyu nature reserve and there is a convergence from three sediment transport pathways southwestward northeastward and eastward c f arrows in fig 1c cai et al 1999 fang et al 2010b zuo et al 2011 the mp in the study area was primarily affected by the population density and human activities around and within the bay before the 1960s below 27 cm depth the population density was low in xiamen bay and economic activity was weak fig s6b hence the sediments within the bay were hardly affected by the coastal human activities but were mainly influenced by the size selective sediment transport with a steady and long distance transport of small grains from the upstream jiulong river figs s3 and s5 from 1960 to the early 1970s 27 to 24 cm depth the still underdeveloped xiamen bay led to limited coastline change within the bay in 1955 1970 fig 1 and a gradual increase of grain size from 1970 to 1984 24 to 16 cm depth rapidly growing coastal development along xiamen bay fig 1 and a lack of environmental protection measures and awareness collectively enhanced the coastal supply of sediment these sediments are poorly sorted coarse grains accumulated in the study area causing as an abrupt change at 24 to 16 cm depth in the gy core fig s4 after the introduction of stricter environmental legislation in 1984 fig 2d the influx of nearshore sediments into the bay declined despite the growing coastal development such as reclamation in 1984 2017 fig 1 this human intervention facilitated a decrease in sediment grain size 16 to 13 cm deph and a stable provenance 13 to 0 cm deph fig s4 fig 4 a suggests that the correlation between high mp amounts and sand content is due to provenance surface sediment transport pattern and composition of terrestrial sediment near xiamen bay salt wedge circulation is one of the controlling factors in the spatial pattern of macro and micro plastics on the seafloor acha et al 2003 simon sánchez et al 2019 and the vertical distribution of mps in the water column in estuarine areas defontaine et al 2020 compared to the provenance and hydrodynamics in the study area the salt wedge is a secondary factor controlling the temporal distribution of mps in the gy sedimentary core 4 2 stratigraphic record of mps in xiamen bay the stratigraphic profiles of mps including abundance polymer types and sizes in the gy core are the result of the comprehensive action of the mp provenance physiochemical features and the sedimentary environment figs s6c and s6d show the decadal variations in mp abundance and depositional fluxes extracted from the stratigraphy of the gy core the onset of mp appearance in the sediments coincided with that of the plastics industry in china china plastics processing industry association 2002 and with the proposed onset of the anthropocene epoch waters et al 2016 small decadal changes in sedimentary mp abundance and depositional fluxes during the 1950 1960s are observed representing only small amounts of plastic entering the coast due to limited plastic production and an undeveloped consumer lifestyle with a low demand for plastic products fig 2c in contrast large mp abundance and depositional fluxes are observed during the 1970 1980s due to rapid economic development population expansion and plastic industry growth in the late 1980s and early 1990s sedimentary mp abundance and depositional fluxes underwent abrupt declines due to mitigation actions to tackle plastic pollution worldwide including the implementation of the marine plastic pollution research and control act marpol for the prevention of pollution from ships however with time the decline was gradually overcome by the accelerated population and plastic industry growth and modern consumer lifestyle that demands a myriad of plastic products the mp abundance in the gy core has been rising slowly again since the 1990s but at a rate less than that witnessed in the 1970s and early 1980s it is possible that benefits from the marpol annex v in 1988 and domestic environmental protection measures were counteracted by the sharp increase in domestic plastic output during the 1990s at an average annual rate of 15 34 anonymity 2007 the high fractions of pes and acrylic in the gy core are consistent with earlier studies showing that pes or acrylic pes copolymers permeate in the subsurface ocean and deep sea sediment and account for a large proportion of the detected mps kanhai et al 2017 woodall et al 2014 the densities of pure pes and acrylic are 1 38 1 40 and 1 18 1 19 g cm3 respectively greater than the seawater density so they tend to sink to the seabed in contrast despite considerably higher production than other polymer types pe and pp are buoyant and typically found at the water surface or in the water column due to their low densities compared to sea water 0 91 0 97 g cm3 and 0 89 0 91 g cm3 for pe and pp respectively however some pe pp and pe pp copolymers can be found in the gy core possibly due to increased densities and reduced re suspension due to colonization of biofouling that facilitates their sinking and settling into the sediment chubarenko et al 2016 clark et al 2016 corcoran et al 2015 kaiser et al 2017 lusher et al 2015 semcesen and wells 2021 van cauwenberghe et al 2013 zhao et al 2017 fig 4 shows that the mp abundance has a significant positive correlation with the proportion of sand components in the sediments which is consistent with the earlier results that high density mps revealed strong correlations with fine sand enders et al 2019 and smaller mps facilitated settling than larger ones under constant environmental conditions semcesen and wells 2021 however mp abundance was inversely correlated with silt and clay concentrations suggesting similar sedimentation behavior of mps and sand but different behaviors of mps with silt and clay the deposition of mps has been studied in recent years defontaine et al 2020 semcesen and wells 2021 yet the potential mp sediment relationship remains unclear enders et al 2019 kane and clare 2019 the sedimentation of mps is different from that of natural particulates even under the same hydrodynamic conditions due to the low density of their constituent polymers hydrophobicity neutrality and corrosion resistance browne et al 2011 waldschläger and schüttrumpf 2019 therefore the empirical rules of natural particulate deposition may not be applicable to mps for example flocculation of clay was limited during mp deposition browne et al 2010 although the distribution and accumulation of mps in marine sediment are influenced by various factors eerkes medrano et al 2015 sources and hydrodynamic regime have been identified as controlling factors enders et al 2019 the distribution of mps and their correlation with natural particulates in the profile of the gy core mirror the varying composition and intensity of mp sources in the different time intervals under a comparatively stable deposition environment considering the surface sediment migration trend in the study area and the fractionation of mps during the depositional process due to differences in physicochemical properties size and density that small sized and high density mps deposited closer to their sources relative to large size and low density ones defontaine et al 2020 semcesen and wells 2021 we believe that the main controlling factors come from the nearshore of xiamen bay rather than through variation in discharges from the jiulong river 4 3 mps and plastic production from the historical profile of mps in the gy core plastic pollution occurred in the early stage of plastic production and consumption in the region plastic waste may enter the environment coincidental with production e g nurdles but the mass of particulate plastic entering an estuarine marine environment comes following use and disposal with a delay caused by indirect transport pathways involving repeated deposition and re working before final burial the mp concentration increased with time in parallel with increased global plastic production brandon et al 2019 dong et al 2020 matsuguma et al 2017 turner et al 2019 wang et al 2018 xue et al 2020 but local contributions e g local plastic production have often been ignored fig 5 shows the historical evolution of sedimentary mps versus plastic production at local regional and global scales between 1950 and 1984 mps were closely correlated with global and china s plastic production despite a global annual increase in plastic production china contributed a limited share of global plastic outputs during this time fig 2c mps in the core therefore appear to link more closely with global plastic production trends the sporadic development of the plastic industry in fujian province and xiamen city yields a weak association of sedimentary mps with regional plastic production between 1988 and 2012 however mps were more related to local plastic production than to provincial or national plastic production a sharp decline in the mps was remarkable from 1984 to 1996 fig 2a despite growing plastic production hence the observed stratigraphic record of the temporal distribution of mps reflected exogenous sources of plastics up to 1984 and local sources from 1988 onwards fishing ropes are considered internationally to be an important source of mps xue et al 2020 but fishing in xiamen bay during recent decades has not been significant gam modeling results show that mps increased nonlinearly with increasing xiamen s plastic output but the confidence intervals increased as well fig 6 a this result suggests that local plastic production was not a major contributor to mps in the marine sediment and that other contributory factors e g plastic waste from upstream cities and local sedimentation patterns account for the primary temporal changes in mps recorded in the sediment core comparison of mps and production rates only provide a component of the story a potentially significant correlation to investigate if not least due to the abundance of production data compared with historical usage and waste management practices the evolution of mp composition with time fig 2b echoes the temporal variation patterns of plastic production and consumption fig 2c although the earliest report of a phenolic production plant in china was from shanghai in 1930 china plastics processing industry association 2002 details on phenolic output scale and distribution are still lacking the mass product usage of plastics in china started in the early 1950s when phenolics were the major plastic product in 1955 china had only 703 small sized plastic companies 80 of which were phenolic plastic manufacturers thus thermoplastics such as pe and pp were mainly imported china plastics processing industry association 2002 phenolic as one type of early plastic product may provide a useful marker for the latest holocene succession i e pre anthropocene however the deposition records of phenolics pre 1952 were not discussed in this study because the available literature is insufficient to expand upon the interpretation of the observed data it is meaningless to discuss this further without sufficient literature support it is generally believed that the onset of the anthropocene coincides with the great acceleration in the 1950s steffen et al 2015 waters et al 2016 and plastic as one of the significant stratigraphic markers of the anthropocene developed during this time in china the literature and data records related to plastics have been gradually enriched from this interval therefore the historical records of mps in the anthropocene stratigraphy and the literature after 1952 can be mutually corroborated to a certain extent the great proletarian cultural revolution 1966 to 1976 in china led to the stagnation of nearly all industries including the manufacture of plastics this may explain why mps increased in the 1950s followed by a downturn in the 1960s although with the lowest concentrations in 1964 fig 2a predating this social stagnation plastic pollution is affected not only by plastic production but also by the type of plastic products and technology development china s economic reform and opening up which started in 1978 facilitated the recovery of the plastic industry for instance during 1978 to 1984 china implemented 170 technological upgrading projects to replace wood with plastics china plastics processing industry association 2002 the explosive growth and a lack of environmental facilities and policies led to enormous emissions of plastic waste which may have resulted in the rapid surge in the mps in the 1970s and a peak of mps in 1984 fig 2a the predominance of pes from 1968 to 1988 fig 2b may be explained by the thriving international imports of the plastics industry during the 1970s to1980s when pes was in large demand due to its popularity as clothing material and after 1976 for a growing chinese demand for fashion the types of plastic products are diverse to meet the needs of not only people s daily lives but also industry requirements china plastics processing industry association 2002 xiamen special economic zone yearbook editorial board 1986 from the 1990s when there was an acceleration of plastic production nationally and locally in xiamen fig 2c the export oriented plastic production and extended plastic lifetime not only significantly reduced the discharge of plastics into the ocean fig 2a but also reflected changes in the nature of plastic consumption pes decreased markedly after 1988 and the proportion of acrylic varied markedly from 86 of mps in 1996 to absent in 2004 table s5 while pe pp abs and pe pp at various times increased in concentrations suggesting the enhanced diversity of mp polymer types due to changes in the plastic industry in xiamen fig 2b pe pp and pvc were produced massively for construction packaging and daily life during that time foreign advanced plastic production technology and machinery introduced to xiamen in 1984 included the production of pp woven bags pvc food grade cling film pvc corrugated pipes and plastic sheets xiamen special economic zone yearbook editorial board 1986 although pvc is not a significant component in the gy core after 1984 4 4 mps and plastic waste regulations changes in plastic waste regulation also explain some of the fluctuations in historical mp records in xiamen bay marine sediments fig 6b shows that mps in the gy core correlate with the net flux of land based plastic debris into the sea p 0 16 suggesting the key role of control measures of terrestrial waste to offshore sedimentary mps the generated municipal solid waste msw in xiamen increased from 9 0 104 to 1 9 106 metric tons tonnes between 1950 and 2016 fig s7c during which plastic waste increased from 360 to 2 1 105 tonnes fig s7e however the volume of land based plastic debris discarded did not follow an upwards trend pink line in fig 1d see also s8e s8f this was due to the improved management of msw after 1980 which resulted in more msw being collected than discarded from 1985 fig s7d counting the increased global recycling and incineration rates of plastic waste geyer et al 2017 and strengthening environmental legislation in xiamen city after the 1980s the amount of plastic debris discarded onto the land and ultimately dumped into the sea fluctuated but remained broadly constant shown by blue and green lines in fig 2d respectively see si land based plastic fluxes into xiamen bay for details furthermore since 1996 marine debris most plastic debris has been routinely collected along xiamen s 52 km2 coastline su et al 2011 approximately 184 tonnes of marine debris were collected each month from the sea surface of xiamen bay between 2009 and 2018 xiamen marine and fisheries bureau 2018 the mitigation efforts for plastic pollution have greatly slowed the growth rate of the net flux of land based plastic debris into the sea despite an overall increase from 160 tonnes in 1950 to 4884 tonnes in 2016 brown line in fig 2d the proportion of plastic waste influx to the sea compared with the generated plastic waste has decreased from 43 7 to 2 32 the effectiveness of regulatory efforts to reduce plastic pollution however has been overpowered by plastic production and consumption leading to the massive accumulation of plastic waste in regional marine environments lau et al 2020 ship derived litter is a major source of plastic pollution in the ocean hagen 1990 horsman 1982 ryan et al 2019 however quantifying the volume of ship generated plastic debris is challenging cantin et al 1990 here we estimated the input of non container ship based plastic debris to xiamen bay assuming three settings of reduced discharges fig 2e see si vessel source plastic debris to xiamen bay using gam simulation we found that ship littering played a role in marine sediment mps fig 6c particularly before 1989 the mps in the gy core showed a positive correlation between increased ship based plastic waste littering and rising cargo throughput in xiamen port fig s8c despite the rapid development of xiamen port between 1989 and 2018 the cargo throughput increased by 42 times plastic waste from ships entering the sea has not increased concomitantly and at times has shown rapid declines this may be due to the rapid development of containerization in xiamen port after 1983 the container throughput of xiamen port grew by 29 5 per annum from 3300 to 1 07 107 teu twenty foot equivalent unit between 1983 and 2018 fig s8a accounting for 2 1 to 83 6 of the total port throughput respectively xiamen municipal bureau of statistics 2019 nearly all garbage from container cargo is disposed onshore and thus the rapid development of containerization resulted in a sharp decline in ship plastic littering cantin et al 1990 additionally the laws and regulations banning ship plastic waste further reduced the vessel source marine litter process china started to enforce the marine environment protection law in 1983 which prevented vessel based waste dumping the world bank 1992 subsequently china s regulation of control over dumping wastes into the sea was enforced in 1985 food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2019 marpol annex v prohibiting direct marine plastic debris dumping came into force in 1988 ninaber 1997 sheavly and register 2007 although the legal validity of marpol is still controversial a large number of studies have documented its effectiveness in reducing plastic waste from ships into the ocean cantin et al 1990 edyvane et al 2004 johnson 1994 xiamen is one of the first six ports in china to establish onshore ship generated waste reception and handling facilities the world bank 1992 the gam simulation results fig s9 table s8 also showed that the number of ships that achieved zero emissions of plastic waste after 1989 may be closer to the real scenario suggesting successful implementation of marpol annex v in xiamen port the rigorous enforcement of annex v as well as national and regional environmental laws and regulations collectively bar the direct dumping of ship generated plastic waste in xiamen bay and emissions are modeled as zero by 2016 fig 2e fig 6d confirms that municipal wastewater was one of the main contributors to historical marine mp pollution before 1989 lacking wastewater treatment plants wwtps in xiamen untreated urban wastewater was directly discharged into the coast providing an estimated mp influx of 4 4 6 1 1013 items yr to xiamen bay during 1950to 1989 fig s9b especially during 1980 to 1989 the mass production and use of pes collectively led to the large discharge flux of wastewater based mps which may be one of the main reasons for the observed peak of mps in marine sediments during that period from 1989 with the establishment of wwtps in xiamen the wastewater treatment rate changed from 18 2 to 96 02 between 1989 and 2018 preventing 1 38 1013 to 1 97 1014 items 20 9 87 4 of mps from flowing into the sea each year the green part in fig s9b assuming the absence of wwtps and other sources we estimate that the abundance of mps in sediment would reach 2 2 105 and 3 2 105 items kg dw in 2012 and 2018 respectively one order of magnitude higher than the current values despite the important role of wwtps in reducing marine mp pollution we cannot neglect the mp outputs from continuous wastewater effluent emissions long et al 2019 5 conclusion the evolution of plastic production use and waste management is recorded by the temporal variations in the abundance size distribution and chemical composition of mps in a marine sediment core from xiamen bay the stratigraphic profile of mps is the result of the combined influence of multiple factors including mp provenances physicochemical properties and sedimentation environment their appearance and abundance provide a useful marker for recognizing the mid 20th century beginning of the anthropocene epoch and component anthropocene strata through to the present day local populations started to commonly use plastic for example the onset of nonphenolic mps in the sediment core c f 1952 despite no known local production source at that time despite the production of plastic at the global to national scales showing an accelerating curve since 1950 the sedimentary record of mp abundance may be used as potential chronostratigraphic horizons a dip in 1960s values is considered to result from the effects of the cultural revolution in china and a peak value in the mid 1980s following the political drive for industrialization mp abundance has declined rapidly since the late 1980s through improved management of municipal solid waste on land introduction of wastewater treatment plants and regulation of plastic waste discarding by ships over the past two decades mp pollution has started to slowly rise again combined with the evidence of stratigraphic data targeted measures are clearly necessary including banning nonessential and single use plastics efficient waste management and plastic removal to mitigate mp pollution and to lessen the impacts of development in the anthropocene the potential uncertainty associated with the chronology of the gy core in this study may be reduced by adopting a more robust sediment core chronology to link socioeconomic patterns of plastic production use and waste management with mp stratigraphic record in future research it was assumed that mps remained stable without significant geochemical changes and vertical migration once they were buried in sediments and taphonomic processes should be considered to extract the historical mp records for future studies bancone et al 2020 although mps have been recognized as an anthropocene marker the longevity and potential fragmentation of mps in sediments are not well understood waters et al 2018 the deposition of mps from water column to seabed the resuspension and burial and aggregation of mps under the action of turbulence and ambient flow play an important role in mp distribution in the sediment core especially in high energy environments peng et al 2018 waldschläger and schüttrumpf 2019 also worth further investigation in low energy coastal environments close to urban and industrial areas such as the present study area however sources are the most critical influencing factor on the long term trend of mps in marine sediment due to the complexity of human and natural activities in coastal areas the sources of mps in marine sediments are diverse and uncertain and not fully understood the regional and global applicability of mps as markers of the anthropocene epoch shall be investigated through global collaborative efforts credit authorship
