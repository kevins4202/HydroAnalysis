sustainable water resources management and ecosystem sustenance while tws changes have been increasingly studied based on gravity recovery and climate experiment grace derived tws dataset spatio temporal changes in tws and the driving factors remain unexplored herein mann kendall test theil sen s slope estimator empirical orthogonal functions eofs component contribution ratio ccr and soil and water assessment tool swat models were employed we found a slight spatial fluctuation of tws and groundwater could affect tws variability in the ea region new hydrological insights high annual twsc was observed in the southwestern and northern regions reaching values of 220 and 100 mm yr respectively among lake basins the maximum and minimum twsc values attained 97 5 28 2 mm yr and 24 8 7 7 mm yr in victoria and tana basins respectively the regional level groundwater contribution was about 42 while 48 53 and 46 were in abaya chamo turkana and victoria basins respectively however surface runoff contribution was 52 and 35 in tana and tanganyika basins respectively the seasonal tws changes show substantial linkage with the lake basins seasonal precipitation distribution our findings highlight the driving factors of tws variability which could help guiding water management policies and promote satellite remote sensing datasets graphical abstract ga1 keywords grace east africa lake basins total water storage component contribution ratio swat model 1 introduction total water storage tws the sum of all water stored on the earth s surface and subsurface is a critical component of the global water and energy budget it plays a vital role in defining the hydrological cycle and water resources availability rodell et al 2018 the effects of changes in tws exhibited serious challenges in sustainable water resources management and ecosystem sustenance in the world mcclain and ambio 2013 pellet et al 2020 in addition tws changes is linked to lake level shrink droughts famine and triggered due to anthropogenic causes of climate change despite such importance the spatio temporal tws change remains less studied relative to hydrological fluxes due to the lack of observation data and challenges in determining all tws components in hydrological modeling pokhrel et al 2015 these hinder our current understanding of change in spatial and temporal tws however this missing tangible information is helpful for stakeholders water managers and policymakers to better understand and plan sustainable water resources management therefore a dataset of tws has important practical significance to monitor changes in land surface water storage and the hydrological characteristics leading to their variations in space and time the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission constitute an essential tool for such analysis as it was used for water storage change discharge effects of large reservoirs drought monitoring and groundwater inversion dankwa et al 2018 feng et al 2017 tapley et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 fortunately grace derived tws has been used for wide range applications including monitoring the spatial and temporal water storage distributions and estimating hydrological flux on the regional and continental scale dankwa et al 2018 feng et al 2013 landerer and swenson 2012 ramillien et al 2008 reager et al 2014 rodell et al 2009 seyoum and milewski 2017 shang et al 2015 wouters et al 2014 yang et al 2017 moreover grace tws model simulations and global land assimilation system gldas datasets often in combination have been used for wide ranging applications including assessing water resources and anthropogenic activities d√∂ll et al 2014 these studies have an unconventional understanding of continually changing global tws under natural hydroclimatic variability and accelerating water management activities further the combining grace and gldas datasets with hydro climatological data have been used to quantify potential factors of extreme events in inter annual tws change in the tarim river basin in asia becker et al 2010 forootan et al 2014 yang et al 2017 2015 previous studies attempted to illustrate tws change in east africa ea and its adjacent regions based on grace data and received important findings awange 2006 becker et al 2010 swenson and wahr 2009 for instance hassan et al 2014 reported that the total water discharge of selected lakes in the ea great rift valley region experienced a significant decline in the average lake level between 2003 and 2006 obtained based on grace csr spherical harmonics altimetry data and hydrological models moore and williams 2014 investigated the variations in tws and the lake level over the ea region from 2002 to 2008 and found a great decline in lake level and inter annual tws variability due to forcing by the 2006 indian ocean dipole iod the effect of drought and anthropogenic factors hitherto most of the existing studies in the ea have been limited to specific basins and the contribution of water balance components to tws variability and the spatio temporal characteristics of tws changes have not been explicitly quantified in addition only a few researchers are implementing grace derived tws datasets to understand hydrological systems in the ea region after 2008 further an increasing number of tws change studies have shown that the lake water storage fluctuation is due to climate change exposed land degradation desertification land use changes frequent floods sediment deposit and drought and displacement of the population awange 2006 kirui and mirzabaev 2014 kirui et al 2021 marchant et al 2007 nicholson 2017 willemen et al 2018 because tws directly replies change in precipitation modulates runoff generation and integrates soil moisture however the prevailing status and tendencies of tws changes in evaluating risk reduction and resilience strategies in the region are still open scientific issues under these circumstances it is essential to properly understand and estimate the spatio temporal tws change based on characterizing water resource changes and improving regional water cycle prediction and interactions with the earth s climate system famiglietti 2004 which reflect the imbalance of water fluxes here we present the spatio temporal variability of tws at regional and lake basins scale over major great rift valley lake basins fig 1 we explore the recurring extreme events on tws variability and the possibility of future dependency on groundwater over surface water sources we analyzed tws distribution from changing trends in spatial and temporal scales from 2002 to 2020 we consider the rainfall season for each country to identify the tremendous role of rainfall variability in tws change the general hypothesis of this study is that there is great spatio temporal heterogeneity in tws and the contribution of water balance components plays a vital role in the variability of tws we aimed to 1 analyze the spatial and temporal patterns of tws variation on the annual and seasonal scale using grace data and a hydrological model and 2 identify the key water balance components that contribute to the variability in tws at seasonal and annual scales the results of this study could help to understand the current regional and basin scale tws changes and are of great value to improve sustainable water management and mitigation strategies for the east africa tws 2 study area datasets and methodology 2 1 study area the study area is located between latitudes 12 s and 22 n and longitudes 22 e and 52 e fig 1 east africa ea is a region located within the horns of the african continent the region can be divided into 11 countries based on topographic drainage divisions we consider five lake basins victoria tana abaya chamo turkana and tanganyika represented in fig 1 the lake basins were selected based on their significant socio economic development importance for the region and their special characteristics such as a transboundary basin victoria turkana and tana basin in contrast the twine basin abaya chamo lake shares ecological manners under seasonal rainfall variability seka and mohammed 2016 the climate of the ea region is complex and diverse it ranges from hot arid and semi arid in most of djibouti eritrea somalia and sudan and the eastern half of ethiopia and kenya to tropical rains in western ethiopia kenya south sudan and uganda the distribution of rainfall in the region is drastic warm temperate rains are also found in the highlands of ethiopia the region has a primary distinguished bimodal rainfall season mean annual rainfall fluctuates from over 2000 mm in southwest ethiopia to less than 250 mm in the arid areas of djibouti eritrea ethiopia kenya somalia and sudan in our work we have used the climate condition of the region based on the hydro climatic characteristics of the countries within the ea region which has not been applied in earlier investigations 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 hydrological datasets tws represents the combined total of all forms of water stored above and below the land surface there are two ways of tws data products direct from satellite monitoring and hydrological model simulation datasets the change in tws in the ea region includes soil moisture sm surface runoff sr and groundwater storage gw the monthly scale simulated tws was derived by vertically integrating the stored surface and subsurface water storage tws derived from gravity recovery and climate experiment grace rl06 mascon solutions was used to evaluate the simulated tws changes from april 2002 to december 2020 the grace satellite mission tapley et al 2004 and its successor mission grace follow on flechtner et al 2016 kornfeld et al 2019 was the first dedicated satellite time variable gravity mission and provides an alternative and unique approach for monitoring large scale mass changes in the earth system we use the latest version of the grace solution due to several advantages related to the spherical harmonics sh solutions these includes less leakage error suitable to use basin level and can be used without any post processing save et al 2016 wiese et al 2016 and is suitable for obtaining more detailed surface mass changes than sh solutions li et al 2022 which is required to understand water storage characteristics on another note xiang et al 2022 recently found that destriping of mascons can be imperfect in some areas of the world which must be considered in the interpretation of results recent studies suggest estimating the long time tws change by filling in the missing grace and grace follow on grace fo data our study region is approximately 6472 404 km2 which is large enough to be observed by grace mission satellites we also processed grace data at the basin scale in tana abaya chamo turkana victoria and tanganyika basins separately to identify the main driving component of water storage change the uncertainty of basin scale grace tws data was estimated by applying grace processing truncation and filtering to simulated sm from the global land data assimilation system gldas crowley et al 2008 ferreira et al 2014 xie et al 2012 in addition to direct tws monitoring from grace there are many other hydrological models including gldas wghm swat and pcr globwb providing tws components biancamaria et al 2019 gldas and swat were used in this work gldas is an uncoupled land surface modeling system that drives multiple models runs globally at the resolution of 0 25 and produces results in near real time the monthly hydrological fluxes variables sm et p and sr were applied from gldas to estimate the basin s water balance rodell et al 2004 the variables are used to address the variations of water storage components gldas drives four land surface models mosaic community land model clm noah and variable infiltration capacity vic we used the noah land surface model of gldas water storage because the tws estimated from the noah ensemble means good agreement with grace derived tws mo et al 2016 its purpose is to ingest satellite and ground based observations using advanced land surface modeling and data assimilation techniques to generate optimal fields of land surface states and fluxes in this study groundwater is represented by estimated gws derived from water balance component which includes soil moisture change sm and surface water change sr data to estimate gws eq 4 gldas water storage without groundwater component can be combined with estimated gws satellite altimetry dataset provides lake level variations computed from topex poseidon t p jason 1 altimetry provided by the united states department of agriculture usda was used to analyze surface water storage in the lake basins the data covering 2002 2020 were used in to analyze the lake level height variation 2 2 2 climate forcing input data to better understand the tws anomaly twsa variation we used three climates variables of the climatic research unit time series cru a monthly gridded climate temperature and precipitation dataset time series dataset from 2000 to 2019 with 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution for consistent spatial resolution hydrological data the 0 5 data observation was effectively downscaled to 0 25 using gldas output data to investigate the relationship between water storage variation and climate factors this climate data was investigated for relationships between twsa and climate variables and the control factors affecting the twsa variations for the swat model simulation meteorological data such as precipitation and temperature daily time series dataset from 2000 to 2020 digital elevation model dem land use and soil were used to be consistent with the temporal resolution table 1 2 3 methods the detailed methodological flow and analytical data structure adopted for this study is presented in fig 2 the grace derived twsa was used to identify annual and seasonal tws variabilities in the ea region specifically in the lake basins of lake victoria lake turkana lake tana lake abaya chamo and lake tanganyika the obtained monthly twsa and water balance components derived from gldas output are used to examine tws change based on the combined analysis of grace measurement twsa the gldas model dataset and hydrological modeling the grace derived twsa were re constructed to 0 25 spatial resolutions and basin level spatial average was evaluated we also the inter annual trends were derived from seasonal and trend decomposition using loess stl the overall methods of the study are presented in detail in the methodological sections below 2 3 1 singular spectrum analysis algorithm the spatio temporal dispersion of the missing grace derived tws data in time series and between two missions grace and grace fo is shown the missing data were filled in using the single spectral analysis ssa method dividing time series into components ordered by variance intensity vautard et al 1992 ssa is created based on singular value decomposition svd a well known factorization matrix process derived from the karhunen loeve decomposition theory of the principal component analysis method for analyzing one dimensional time series drazin et al 1992 the missing data were filled by adding two loops to the original ssa method and gradually updating the gap value this study follows a comprehensive methodology of grace derived tws data filling found in previous studies li et al 2019 wang et al 2021 yi and sneeuw 2021 the regional based missing data for 33 months from april 2002 to december 2020 fig 3 were filled using the ssa gap filling method in the mat lab script to test the ability and evaluate the performance of properly processing missing data an ssa gap filling method in the time series data the root mean square error rmse was used which is obtained with 1 r m s e i 1 n x i y i 2 n we have checked the consistency of ssa gap filling by using the rmse computed between the original tws derived from the water balance equation and the reconstructed data by the ssa algorithm along each pixel of the time series 2 3 2 calculation of long term spatio temporal tws variations the terrestrial water storage tws in the vertical integrations of water storage components considered a water balance approach for land hydrological applications in a specific region the change in tws equates to the difference between the two preceding and following months estimates grace derived tws data was investigated for tws change according to the water balance equation eq 2 the variation in tws includes a vertically integrated measurement of changes in groundwater storage Œ¥gws soil moisture storage Œ¥sms and surface water storage in rivers lakes and wetlands Œ¥sws snow and biomass due to the arid climate conditions snow and biomass storage contributions are negligible the tws was calculated using the three water storage components of monthly time series data in this approach the change in water storage Œ¥tws was monitored from grace derived tws anomalies at monthly seasonal and inter annual time scales from 2002 to 2020 2 p e t s r Œ¥ t w

methods several statistical methods were employed in this section to record effective signals and extract valuable information from our study results first for time series decomposition and uncertainty we used seasonal trend decomposition using loess stl for monthly time series decomposition jing et al 2019 robert et al 1990 the harmonic analysis approach to remove seasonality from the original data similar to the study by andrew et al 2017 which reported a valuable technique to estimate the time series trend of tws the stl method based on a locally weighted regression local regression decomposition approach consists of a sequence of smoothing operations of the time series tws data the decomposition method is applied based on locally weighted smoothing of deseasonalized time series the smoothing parameters are analytically optimized to minimize spectral leakage between high and low frequency components 5 s t o t a l s l o n g t e r m s s e a s o n a l i t y residuals where stotal is the original signal slong term is the long term trend sseasonality is the seasonality signal and residuals is the residual component the uncertainty of grace derived twsa was calculated from the residuals after removing long term trends and interannual annual and semiannual amplitudes as described in eq 6 the uncertainty in the data was derived by considering both measurement and leakage errors the uncertainty of the twsa component is determined from the sum of the standard deviation and monthly trend value the method coincides with the one by hasan et al 2019 and their linear trends were calculated respectively jing et al 2019 the uncertainty is calculated with 6 œÖ s t d t w s a i s t d t w s a t r e n d s i where œÖ is uncertainty of twsa std is standard deviation of twsa previous studies used this technique as a useful statistical tool for a dataset panda and wahr 2016 the null hypothesis of no correlation r 0 against the alternative hypothesis that there is a significant correlation is evaluated at the significance level p 0 05 unless the exact significance level p is mentioned moreover to understand the spatial evolution the spatial anomalies of hydro climatic variables are mapped using the inverse distance weighting method in the arcgis toolbox secondly we applied the mann kendall trend test m k test to identify trends from deseasonalized precipitation and the tws series computed as described by hamed 2008 we used the python programming language to analyze the temporal characteristics of hydrological and climate factors the kendall test is widely applied to detect trends in hydro climate data to calculate linear trends birara et al 2018 mishra et al 2010 hence the time series statistical analysis to estimate the trend of precipitation and tws in long term annual and seasonal distribution is determined using the mann kendall analysis however we derived the linear trend by using the linear least square method with the significance tested by the student s t test at the 95 p 0 05 and the 99 p 0 01 confidence levels 7 s i 1 n j 1 i 1 s i g n x i x j 8 s i g n x i x j 1 x i x j 0 0 x i x j 0 1 x i x j 0 and 9 z s n n 1 2 n 5 18 s 0 0 s 0 s 1 n n 1 2 n 5 18 s 0 if z is greater than 0 the data shows an increasing trend if z is less than 0 the data shows a decreasing trend at z values greater than or equal to 1 28 1 64 and 2 32 the data passed the significant test reliability of 90 95 and 99 respectively the pearson correlation coefficient exhibits the linear correlation between two variables giving a value between 1 and 1 if the value is less than 0 this implies a negative correlation between the two variables 10 r x y i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where r xy is simple linear correlation coefficient between the twsa variations and deriving factors xi is the twsa or twsa of the ith year yi is the driving factor results with p 0 05 were considered significant the magnitude of the trend estimated using theil sen s estimator by calculating the slope it is a robust trend statistical method used to calculate the median slopes and estimate the magnitude of a trend the magnitude is estimated by 11 s t w s m e d i a n t w s j t w s i t j t i j i where stws theil sen s median i and j are the time series sequences and xj and xi are the tws values at tj and ti respectively when stws 0 the tws in the corresponding pixel reveals an increasing trend when s tws 0 the tws in this pixel reveals a decreasing trend the significance test was explored using the man kendall test with p 0 05 the trend analysis was calculated with python 2 7 thirdly we used the empirical orthogonal function eof a common method to decompose time series of variable fields into two components the spatial component with no change over time and the temporal function that only considers temporal variations eof is a widely applied statistical method for analyzing large spatio temporal datasets bj√∂rnsson and venegas 1997 xie 2019 and performing a decomposition into dominant spatio temporal modes to reduce the input time series datasets to a smaller set of orthogonal patterns this method is consistent with the study zhu et al 2021 used to identify variability patterns in climate datasets the technique s basic attitude is to decompose the variable s empirical orthogonal function eofs uncorrelated in space principal components pcs are uncorrelated in time we can explore the data from the eofs and principal components as follows 12 y s t y t e o f 1 s p c 1 t e o f 2 s p c 2 t eof analysis was applied in this study to characterize the spatio temporal variation of tws anomaly and precipitation in the ea region mainly lake basin areas pc was carried out to derive the preferred storage variations described by the eof patterns the variance covariance data are primarily used to organize the technique they explain the variability and have orthogonal spatial patterns and uncorrelated time series navarra and simoncini 2010 the decomposition approach considers the processing by establishing that matrix x tends to spatial point values m and several observation values n at different temporal points p the expression is described as matrix x xij i 1 2 m j 1 2 n next the covariance matrix c xxt p is calculated then the matrix is decomposed orthogonally c e et then the eigen vector can be calculated to decompose the spatial domain orthogonally finally we have calculated the pcs pc e y as the corresponding main components in temporal change trends we employed the eof analysis concept used in hu et al 2014 and ndehedehe et al 2016 to quantify spatial climate variability patterns and analyse the dominant spatio temporal variability of tws and precipitation by considering regional tws change we identified regional tws change trends and spatio temporal patterns from decomposing grace tws data and precipitation data into sets of pcs and eofs this normalization method was computed using climate data operators cdo software and python 2 3 4 tws component estimation to estimate the influence of individual storage components in tws variation we determine the component contribution ratio ccr kim et al 2009 these were used to quantify the mean percentage contribution of the individual water storage component to the temporal variability of the tws derived from grace we evaluated surface water storage groundwater and soil moisture ccr is a ratio of mean absolute deviation mad of components to summed tws at each time t 13 c c r 1 t t 1 t m a d t w s t where t is the total length of the time series hydrological modeling is the second method we used to identify individual components that contribute to water storage variation the hydrological model is commonly developed for calculating the water balance component which has a great role in the spatio temporal variability of tws therefore a physically based hydrological model soil and water assessment tool swat was applied to project the impact on different water balance components of water resources across the lake basins of the ea region the swat model is a semi distributed continuous daily time step model that represents the main hydrological processes to predict basin hydrologic responses e g flow percolation infiltration using static topography soil and land use and meteorological inputs arnold et al 2000 the model has addressed different environmental issues particularly climate and land use change effects gassman et al 2007 in contrast we compared tws change from grace solutions between the gldas and the swat models the simulation of water budgets from 2002 to 2020 the water balance equations based on the swat model can be expressed as 14 Œ¥ s i p i a e t i w y l d i 15 w y l d i s r

discharge of the ith hydrologic response unit hru 3 results 3 1 spatio temporal variations distribution of tws in the ea region 3 1 1 long term spatial temporal variability in grace tws here we first examine how tws variations that occur seasonally and annually have evolved over the study period regionally fig 4 illustrates annual average tws changes in spatial patterns coefficient of variation cv and trends in the ea region from 2002 to 2020 fig 4a b and c represent changes in a annual spatial distribution b coefficient of variations and c the m k trend tests under historical conditions the magnitude of change in tws signal is maximum in the southwestern region at 220 mm yr equivalent to water height ewh or 1423 9 km3 yr in volume and the minimum magnitude is observed in the northern parts of the region at 100 mm yr ewh or 647 74 km3 yr in volume mainly over eritrea south and north sudan and the southeast of kenya with the maximum water storage reduction fig 4a overall it can be seen that the long term mean annual change in tws over the ea region reveals a decreasing trend from the central region to the northern parts which indicates that the tws anomaly is negatively correlated over the northern part of the sudan region these areas are mostly made up of dry land which has been dramatically exposed by desertification from fig 4 we observe that the change reflects a strong spatial heterogeneity in tws changes across the region the long term monthly regional mean tws and its linear trend were calculated using the grace and gldas solutions expressed in mm month in the ea as shown in fig 5 the pearson correlation coefficients r2 analysis shows that twss change is significantly correlated with grace derived and gldas estimated in the ea region with an r2 value of 0 54 overall fig 5 shows the linear trend of tws changes in spatial mean over the region with a slight increase of 42 4 mm yr or about 276 2 km3 yr since the distributed tws fluctuated throughout the entire study period 2002 2020 the period was divided into four sub periods i e 2002 2006 2007 2011 2012 2016 and 2017 2020 to explore more details on the pattern of the changes the change in tws showed a slightly decreasing trend with a loss of 3 50 mm yr 22 66 km3 yr from 2002 to 2006 and 2 95 mm yr 19 089 km3 yr from 2012 to 2016 respectively on the other hand the tws changes showed a moderately increasing 1 33 mm yr 8 61 km3 yr from 2007 to 2011 and a sharp increase after 2017 with 60 99 mm yr 394 72 km3 yr overall we used precipitation p evapotranspiration et runoff r and temperature t to verify the grace derived tws change based on the water balance closure explicitly tws decreased during 2005 2006 and mid 2016 the long term dry condition corresponds to persistent negative precipitation surface runoff anomalies and apparent tws slightly increased in the periods after 2019 which is attributed to positive precipitation anomalies from long term monthly time series anomalies fig 6a b as well as a significant decline in temperature and et anomalies fig 6c d the drought event process is consistent with water deficits from 2005 to 2006 and 2016 caused largely by persistent precipitation runoff reduction and the increment of et these are consistent with the study conducted by forootan et al 2019 who indicated that precipitation contributes to the overall water balance and directly affects the tws variations and volumes as indicated here precipitation dominantly boosts water storage and et and temperature have opposite features whereas surface runoff integrates with precipitation and et fig 6 shows the change rate of annual precipitation runoff et and temperature which are significant climate factors that trigger the variability conditions of tws at the regional scale 3 1 2 seasonal spatial variability in tws the changes in the seasonal cycle of tws vary spatially among regions as estimated by grace derived tws datasets from 2002 to 2020 using eq 1 fig 7 with significant increases and decreasing patterns that amplify the regional water resources changes the change in seasonal tws is observed in different patterns between the southwest northwest and east of ea overall fig 7 shows the seasonal spatial distribution of estimated tws change showing 38 9 mm yr 251 8 km3 yr and 18 9 mm yr 122 8 km3 yr during the djf and mam seasons respectively on the other hand tws change showed a negative value of 50 3 mm yr 325 7 km3 yr and 7 55 mm yr 48 9 km3 yr in jja and son respectively in addition the seasonal trend analysis of tws change was carried out using the mann kendall trends z statistics and sen s slope estimator q for the magnitude of trends the result of the seasonal trends analysis is shown in table 2 the mam and jja seasons are showing a negative change with z statistic values of 1 98 and 0 18 and sen s slopes of 0 26 and 0 031 mm yr respectively while djf and son show positive change with z statistic values of 2 9 and 1 08 and sen s slopes of 0 32 and 0 16 mm yr respectively fig 7 shows the temporal regional averaged changes in tws anomalies precipitation et anomalies and soil moisture in all seasons djf mam jja son over the ea region from 2002 to 2020 the temporal pattern is attained according to the derived seasonal signals by exploring the intra annual distributions of tws et and precipitation the tws amplitude and sign of the anomalies advocate that jja and son seasons have maximum water storage losses in 2005 2006 and 2016 modulated by high et and precipitation reduction in mam season respectively these contribute to mam season precipitation and et influencing the inter annual surface and subsurface components of hydrological cycles however the jja season precipitation shows a high loss which modulates the trend in water storage variability generally the long term trend analysis in seasonal tws showed a non significant change which exhibited statistically significant at the 95 confidence level positive tws trends in the region fig 8 3 1 3 components contribution to tws changes in the ea region based on simulated sms from noah land surface models lsms in the gldas and monitored sr changes from satellite altimetry gws was estimated using eq 4 the long time trend of gws was significantly increasing with 13 mm yr from 2002 to 2020 on the other hand sm and sr have significantly decreasing trends of 5 8 and 2 3 mm yr respectively on a regional scale ccr was investigated and calculated by eq 13 to estimate the contribution of water balance components to tws change from the used water balance components ccr in the region the contributions of gws sm and sr to tws change are 42 29 and 20 respectively in the ea region it was concluded that the gw contribution is dominant in water storage variation at the ea region level 3 2 lake basins tws variations and trend analysis here we first examine how tws variation and its trends changed over lake basins over our study period from 2002 2020 we calculated the spatial and temporal change trends of the tws in each lake basin fig 10 we selected five lake basins lake tana basin ltb abaya chamo lake basin aclb turkana lake basin tulb lake victoria basin lvb and tanganyika lake basin tlb to study the spatial and temporal variation of tws we used the theil sen median analysis method eq 11 to calculate the long term monthly tws change trend in the lake basins the results obtained the lowest water storage ranges in ltb and aclb whereas tulb lvb and tlb obtained the largest variation range the change in tws indicated the increasing tendency over the lvb fig 10 also shows a decreasing tendency of trends in the southern lvb tlb ltb and northern parts of aclb and tulb according to the spatio temporal variable characteristics shown in figs 9 and 10 twsa tends to increase in all lake basins we applied change in annual trend analysis of tws calculated in the lake basins fig 11 using the mann kendall trend test the water storage variations have shown significant increases in victoria and tanganyika basins 0 85 and 0 605 mm yr respectively but moderate in turkana abaya chamo and tana lake basins 0 533 0 49 0 27 mm yr respectively fig 11 these results were consistent with the finding by hassan et al 2014 some studies have indicated that water hyacinth which covers 30 of the lake area solomon 2017 blocks the hydrological cycles over the lake area influencing the lake water storage change the rate of water storage variation in the victoria basin is higher than in all the other lake basins with an annual trend rate 97 5 28 2 mm yr tws extremely decreased from 2002 to 2006 approximately between 1 and 3 mm yr these decreasing values could be attributed to severe drought events the annual trend is shown as water storage change providing a more reliable representation of twsc in the basin fig 11 illustrates the increasing trend in lake basin water storage with a clear increment in the grace data especially after 2018 in all lake basin areas which shows the influence of heavy rainfall and unexpected silt deposits from the tributary river basins however from 2002 to 2006 all lake basins had a decreasing trend related to the drought event these results match those observed earlier hassan et al 2014 the increment does not show that the lake water volume is increasing and lake water volume estimation is not calculated in this study 3 2 1 the seasonal tws change analysis to examine and understand the seasonal and annual fluctuations of surface water in the lake basins we analyzed basin averaged changes of tws and climate forcing variables in whole seasons the long term trend analysis in seasonal water storage change showed a significant trend in lake victoria and abaya chamo basins in all seasons while the long term tws change has shown a significant trend towards increase observed during jja mam and djf in lake tana turkana and tanganyika basins respectively see supplementary table s 1 a non significant trend is observed during djf and mam in lake tanganyika basin in lake tana abaya chamo and lake turkana basins seasonal tws change shows a negative tendency in djf with 4 2 4 7 and 13 5 km3 yr and mam with 1 8 0 8 and 4 8 km3 yr while in victoria and tanganyika lake basins the negative tendency is explored in jja with 13 78 and 75 1 km3 yr respectively and in son season showed 3 29 and 47 1 km3 yr respectively these showed a significant agreement with the climate distributions of the basin 3 2 2 connection of lakes basin tws changes and hydrological fluxes the temporal correlation between tws and rainfall exhibited a remarkable lag correlation corresponding to the lake basins see supplementary fig s 4 fig s 4 shows that tws lags behind rainfall for approximately 2 3 months in the lake basins the lag correlation influences the seasonal and annual water storage patterns from table 3 the correlation coefficients cc between hydrological fluxes et and tws anomaly over all lake basins were approximately 0 51 with the p value less than 0 001 which indicates et greatly influences the lake water storage variability the sr and et were correlated well to grace tws with high ccs of 0 80 and 0 7 respectively in the tana lake basin the correlation between precipitation and tws is quantified with lagged cc and the result is shown in table 3 the one month lag correlation between grace tws and prcp in abaya chamo lake was negatively correlated cc 0 03 in table 4 lists the summarized correlation root means square error and mean error between grace tws and gldas tws during the dry and wet season respectively to address discrepancies in lake basins the cc between grace and gldas in the wet season is lowest in the victoria lake basin cc 0 18 and the highest is in the lake tana basin cc 0 77 although it is lowest in victoria cc 0 01 and highest in lake tana cc 0 55 in the dry season compared with the regional seasonal climate influence gldas tws underestimates grace derived tws in the tana lake basin and overestimates it in the tanganyika lake basin in the dry season with mean errors of 2 05 and 6 51 respectively the maximum mean error of gldas tws against grace twsa in the tanganyika basin exhibits the influence of gws the results showed that precipitation has stronger interannual variability in the tana lake basin and tanganyika lake basin in contrast the cc between grace and gldas in the wet season of the abaya chamo lake basin is the lowest cc 0 37 compared with those in the dry season cc 0 54 which indicates that low cc is low between grace and gldas mainly attributed to low cc values in the wet season 3 3 identifying key water balance components to tws change 3 3 1 components contribution to tws changes in the lake basins we applied the same approaches in section 3 1 4 over each lake basin to identify the individual water balance component contribution to water storage change the result shown in table 5 shows that gws is the dominant component in the abaya chamo turkana and victoria lake basins with ccr values of 48 53 and 46 respectively with a long time trend significantly increasing with at least 0 76 mm yr sr is the main water balance component that alters the water storage change over lake tana and tanganyika basins with ccr values of 52 and 35 with long time trend of non significant change with 0 001 and 0 001 mm yr respectively 3 3 2 water balance components from swat model the inter annual temporal correlation between the tws anomaly and the climate variables over the lake basin areas of the ea region is strong we have analyzed our correlation using the most driving components that influence the water storage changes like precipitation evapotranspiration and surface runoff the correlation in fig 12 illustrates temporal variations of the time series of annual tws anomaly and the hydro climatological variables over the lake basins the water balance components are estimated from swat hydrological modeling simulated monthly over the lake basin areas using eq 14 15 fig 12 illustrates the swat simulation analysis results that describe the water balance components showing an apparent annual water storage variability the swat model simulation work here mainly aims to identify the most sensitive parameter that will alter the change in tws over the entire basin the simulation result was correlated with the tws increase in the lake basins which was detected starting in 2018 in all lake basins the result showed the swat model estimated gw recharge dominantly alters the tws of abaya chamo turkana and victoria lake basin with cc values of 0 74 0 63 and 0 79 respectively while soil water et and sr were key components that dominated the estimated cc value of 0 41 0 29 and 0 49 respectively over tana lake basin additionally the swat model estimated the water balance components in the southern parts of victoria which is the tanganyika basin and found that gw and sr are the main contributing components showing water storage variability this is in contrast to research findings indicating that land cover change influences the variability of tws over the ea region lake basin areas we come back to that in detail in the discussion section 3 4 spatio temporal patterns of twsa determined by pca method fig 13 shows the pca decomposition of tws over east africa the first pca mode which explains 76 3 of the variance represents the annual variability of tws changes in the region the first pca mode of change in tws shows the strongest annual variability over the northwestern parts of the region and to a lesser extent over northeastern furthermore eof1 and its corresponding pcs shows an increasing trend in tws change over the ea for the study period the second eof and its corresponding pc shows 11 5 of the annual tws variability fig s 3 illustrates the tws spatial array of the first two eof s estimated for the wet season jjas mam and ond eof1 and eof2 describe 76 3 and 11 5 respectively of the variability and show a significantly high value in the central and northern parts of the region indicating impacts on jjas season water storage distribution over the ea region to further analyze the spatial distribution patterns of seasonal cycle tws change and precipitation over the lake basins the main rain fall seasons were selected from june to september jjas with a long rain season and march to may mam with a short rain season the result obtained from the time series analysis of pca shows that two extreme conditions exist over lake tana abaya chamo and lake turkana basins during the jjas season average precipitation fig 14 a the values are hydrologically indicative of floods and droughts over the basins which can have a big impact on how much water is stored interestingly the pca shows the same conditions over the victoria and tanganyika lake basins during the long rain season mam of the ea region with a remarkable declining drought condition fig 14 b which declares that the mam rainfall has an insignificant influence on the tws change however the long term monthly tws change showed remarkable agreements with the seasonal precipitation due to the lag correlation effect 4 discussion we investigated at how tws changed from 2002 2020 in different parts of the ea region and we provided a map that shows how that changed over time changes in tws result in a decrease in precipitation and mitigate future hydrological and climate variability impacts leading to water storage changes there is a general tendency to focus on extreme events and more intensive farming as sources of tws variability hassan et al 2014 besides comparing the change in tws and the validity of our hypothesis the contributions of the fundamental water balance component of tws variations were quantified using the ccr and swat model and the method was configured at the regional and basin level the ccr provided the gw estimated at 42 of the total tws in the ea region while sm and sr contributed only 29 and 20 of the total tws respectively this indicates that gw mainly dominates the total discharge of water storage through the region on the lake basin level lake tana abaya chamo turkana victoria and tanganyika basins ccr was identified as inconsistent with the regional domain chao et al 2021 estimated that gw contributes 48 to the tws in the yangtze river basin and sm and sr contribute 25 and 12 respectively to the total tws this roughly agrees to our values although it concerns a completely different environment in contrast to a large proportion of these studies the contribution of individual components was estimated sr is dominant with ccr of 57 43 and 38 in lake tana victoria and the tanganyika basins respectively hassan et al 2014 support our finding which estimated that surface runoff and soil moisture content are the key components in lake tanganyika victoria and malawi this dominancy of surface runoff is due to the basins rainfall variability and topographic conditions while gw contributes 53 and 48 in the lake turkana and abaya chamo basin respectively it is similar to regional water balance component estimation in addition the study estimated the component contributions using the hydrological swat model at the lake basin level the result showed that the swat model estimated gw recharge significantly altered the tws of abaya chamo turkana and victoria lake basins with cc values of 0 74 0 63 and 0 79 respectively while soil water et and sr were key components that dominated the estimated cc values of 0 35 0 41 and 0 55 respectively in the lake tana basin the water storage changed in the basin this method is consistent with previous studies houphou√´t boigny and lom√© 2020 which used the swat model to estimate water balance components in west africa at the same time the lake tana basin shows that precipitation is the most fundamental water balance component influencing water storage variability which is the major recharging source of water resources andualem et al 2020 dessie et al 2014 worqlul et al 2018 remarkably groundwater also influences the water storage change over the turkana lake basin severely influenced by active tectonic geology and groundwater linkage the result coincides with the finding of a previous study bo√´s et al 2019 which identified lake sediments with dated horizons constraining basin dynamics fig 12 b shows again that swat can detect an important tws component in the lake abaya chamo basin precipitation is significantly influencing key components of the variability of tws furthermore the increasing surface and subsurface runoff over the basin over time indicates that another variable influences the variability of tws the finding is supported by gebeyehu et al 2019 who predicted agricultural ecological and hydrological processes the basin has a high temperate zone with a bimodal rainfall season land use land cover change has affected water resources woldeyohannes et al 2018 in the victoria lake basin fig 12 c tws declined significantly in 2006 influenced by et which dominantly controlled the variability our findings are supported by earlier studies e g sewagudde 2009 who considered the effect of the drought that persisted between 2003 and 2006 in the region however similar to the other lake areas in 2019 and 2020 the basin has a high tws trend mainly indicating the influence of rainfall at the same time the direct fluctuation trend of all water balance components shows their direct influence on the variability of annual twsa globally many studies have reported an abrupt reduction of water volume with abnormal sediment deposits causing flooding which is consistent with our results for example in lake michigan and huron heavy rainfall and higher water levels are seen in 2019 and 2020 leading to erosion and flooding along with many parts of the great lake shoreline carter and steinschneider 2018 in recent decades the rapid decline in lake tws volume has been a growing concern creating a global movement towards establishing rehabilitation work since then there has been a need to develop a framework that assists in informed decision making the eofs analysis efficiently extracted large scale spatial patterns of precipitation derived from cru for the ea regions the test result shows the first two eofs separately and we used the first two most variable indicators efficiently eofs analysis has the advantage of illustrating the main spatial pattern of variability the first pca mode which explains 76 3 of the variance represents the region s annual variability of tws changes fig 13 the time series analysis pcs shows the observable extreme in this study we have seen two extreme rainfall season tws patterns over the lake basins areas the findings in fig 14 a show that jjas season rainfall primarily influences lake tana lake abaya chamo and the lake turkana basins all of which were affected by drought 2008 2007 and 2017 however there were flooding events in 2015 2014 and 2006 in lake tana abaya chamo and turkana basins the mam rainfall season tws pattern over the lake basins was also investigated fig 14b these results mainly show extreme events over the two lake basins lake victoria and lake tanganyika the estimated extreme flooding events occurred in 2005 and 2008 respectively the result tells us the fluctuation of tws over the basin due to climate and anthropogenic activity inconsistent with our results the pattern showed flooding events for both lake basins in 2020 this study delivered a fruitful observation and model based results can be linked to assess the statistical relationships of water balance components and open directions to examine how future changes in tws might offset drought impacts hopefully this study will provide valuable insight into lake basins available water resources management using an emerging remote sensing dataset 5 conclusions and perspectives this study investigated the spatio temporal variations of tws and its driving components across the ea region and lake basins scale from the perspectives of water storage components and water fluxes the results indicated a slight fluctuation of the annual average spatial tws especially in the south west which increased by 220 mm yr ewh or 1423 9 km3 yr in volume in the northern part tws decreased by 100 mm yr ewh or 647 74 km3 yr in volume climatic factors mainly caused theses variations as for the temporal change in tws unusual fluctuation patterns were observed with a significant decrease in 2005 2006 and 2016 and a slight increase after 2017 however at the regional scale long term seasonal twsc tends to be non significant across the ea region the variations of lake basin level water storage are significant in victoria and tanganyika basins 0 85 and 0 605 mm yr respectively but moderate in turkana 0 533 mm yr abaya chamo 0 49 mm yr and tana basins 0 27 mm yr a strong long term trend was found among seasonal tws changes in lake tana turkana and tanganyika basins showing a significantly increase during jja mam and djf pearson correlation coefficients r2 0 54 showed twss had a significant correlation with grace derived and gldas estimated in the ea region based on the ccr and data used in this study the relative contributions of individual tws components in the ea region and the lake basins revealed new insights for understanding the distributions of water resources the ccr investigation in the whole ea region found gw contribution to the tws variations was 42 while sm and sr contributions were 29 and 20 respectively in the lake basins gw is the main contributor in lake turkana abaya chamo and victoria basins with ccr of 48 53 and 46 respectively however in the lake tana and tanganyika basins sr was proven to be the dominant component accounting for 57 and 38 respectively the swat model established a strong correlation between water balance components for the lake basins and the tws in all basins the two methods ccr and swat model used to estimate the components could be applied to other lake basins globally eofs analysis was utilized to identify the spatio temporal patterns of tws change and seasonal precipitation based on decomposition s regional remote sensing database the first two eofs employed to explain the annual and seasonal variability demonstrated that seasonal water storage distribution is strongly correlated to precipitation this study used twsc estimation in connection with climate teleconnection which could be important to predict the impact of droughts on water yields it provides guidelines to investigate serious water management issues using grace twsa data overall the results provide information to better understand water resources potentials and controlling measures however there exist some uncertainties and scarcity of in situ data in large scale regional based datasets for estimating tws changes estimating the influence of extreme climate events on water storage and providing appropriate mitigation measures over the lake basin should be a priority for future studies credit authorship contribution statement ayalkibet m seka conceptualization validation formal analysis

temporal changes in tws and the driving factors remain unexplored herein mann kendall test theil sen s slope estimator empirical orthogonal functions eofs component contribution ratio ccr and soil and water assessment tool swat models were employed we found a slight spatial fluctuation of tws and groundwater could affect tws variability in the ea region new hydrological insights high annual twsc

runoff contribution was 52 and 35 in tana and tanganyika basins respectively the seasonal tws changes show substantial linkage with the lake basins seasonal precipitation distribution our findings highlight the driving factors of tws variability which could help guiding water management policies and promote satellite remote sensing datasets graphical abstract ga1 keywords grace east africa lake basins total water storage component contribution ratio swat model 1 introduction total water storage tws the sum of all water stored on the earth s surface and subsurface is a critical component of the global water and energy budget it plays a vital role in defining the hydrological cycle and water resources availability rodell et al 2018 the effects of changes in tws exhibited serious challenges in sustainable water resources management and ecosystem sustenance in the world mcclain and ambio 2013 pellet et al 2020 in addition tws changes is linked to lake level shrink droughts famine and triggered due to anthropogenic causes of climate change despite such importance the spatio temporal tws change remains less studied relative to hydrological fluxes due to the lack of observation data and challenges in determining all tws components in hydrological modeling pokhrel et al 2015 these hinder our current understanding of change in spatial and temporal tws however this missing tangible information is helpful for stakeholders water managers and policymakers to better understand and plan sustainable water resources management therefore a dataset of tws has important practical significance to monitor changes in land surface water storage and the hydrological characteristics leading to their variations in space and time the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission constitute an essential tool for such analysis as it was used for water storage change discharge effects of large reservoirs drought monitoring and groundwater inversion dankwa et al 2018 feng et al 2017 tapley et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 fortunately grace derived tws has been used for wide range applications including monitoring the spatial and temporal water storage distributions and estimating hydrological flux on the regional and continental scale dankwa et al 2018 feng et al 2013 landerer and swenson 2012 ramillien et al 2008 reager et al 2014 rodell et al 2009 seyoum and milewski 2017 shang et al 2015 wouters et al 2014 yang et al 2017 moreover grace tws model simulations and global land assimilation system gldas datasets often in combination have been used for wide ranging applications including assessing water resources and anthropogenic activities d√∂ll et al 2014 these studies have an unconventional understanding of continually changing global tws under natural hydroclimatic variability and accelerating water management activities further the combining grace and gldas datasets with hydro climatological data have been used to quantify potential factors of extreme events in inter annual tws change in the tarim river basin in asia becker et al 2010 forootan et al 2014 yang et al 2017 2015 previous studies attempted to illustrate tws change in east africa ea and its adjacent regions based on grace data and received important findings awange 2006 becker et al 2010 swenson and wahr 2009 for instance hassan et al 2014 reported that the total water discharge of selected lakes in the ea great rift valley region experienced a significant decline in the average lake level between 2003 and 2006 obtained based on grace csr spherical harmonics altimetry data and hydrological models moore and williams 2014 investigated the variations in tws and the lake level over the ea region from 2002 to 2008 and found a great decline in lake level and inter annual tws variability due to forcing by the 2006 indian ocean dipole iod the effect of drought and anthropogenic factors hitherto most of the existing studies in the ea have been limited to specific basins and the contribution of water balance components to tws variability and the spatio temporal characteristics of tws changes have not been explicitly quantified in addition only a few researchers are implementing grace derived tws datasets to understand hydrological systems in the ea region after 2008 further an increasing number of tws change studies have shown that the lake water storage fluctuation is due to climate change exposed land degradation desertification land use changes frequent floods sediment deposit and drought and displacement of the population awange 2006 kirui and mirzabaev 2014 kirui et al 2021 marchant et al 2007 nicholson 2017 willemen et al 2018 because tws directly replies change in precipitation modulates runoff generation and integrates soil moisture however the prevailing status and tendencies of tws changes in evaluating risk reduction and resilience strategies in the region are still open scientific issues under these circumstances it is essential to properly understand and estimate the spatio temporal tws change based on characterizing water resource changes and improving regional water cycle prediction and interactions with the earth s climate system famiglietti 2004 which reflect the imbalance of water fluxes here we present the spatio temporal variability of tws at regional and lake basins scale over major great rift valley lake basins fig 1 we explore the recurring extreme events on tws variability and the possibility of future dependency on groundwater over surface water sources we analyzed tws distribution from changing trends in spatial and temporal scales from 2002 to 2020 we consider the rainfall season for each country to identify the tremendous role of rainfall variability in tws change the general hypothesis of this study is that there is great spatio temporal heterogeneity in tws and the contribution of water balance components plays a vital role in the variability of tws we aimed to 1 analyze the spatial and temporal patterns of tws variation on the annual and seasonal scale using grace data and a hydrological model and 2 identify the key water balance components that contribute to the variability in tws at seasonal and annual scales the results of this study could help to understand the current regional and basin scale tws changes and are of great value to improve sustainable water management and mitigation strategies for the east africa tws 2 study area datasets and methodology 2 1 study area the study area is located between latitudes 12 s and 22 n and longitudes 22 e and 52 e fig 1 east africa ea is a region located within the horns of the african continent the region can be divided into 11 countries based on topographic drainage divisions we consider five lake basins victoria tana abaya chamo turkana and tanganyika represented in fig 1 the lake basins were selected based on their significant socio economic development importance for the region and their special characteristics such as a transboundary basin victoria turkana and tana basin in contrast the twine basin abaya chamo lake shares ecological manners under seasonal rainfall variability seka and mohammed 2016 the climate of the ea region is complex and diverse it ranges from hot arid and semi arid in most of djibouti eritrea somalia and sudan and the eastern half of ethiopia and kenya to tropical rains in western ethiopia kenya south sudan and uganda the distribution of rainfall in the region is drastic warm temperate rains are also found in the highlands of ethiopia the region has a primary distinguished bimodal rainfall season mean annual rainfall fluctuates from over 2000 mm in southwest ethiopia to less than 250 mm in the arid areas of djibouti eritrea ethiopia kenya somalia and sudan in our work we have used the climate condition of the region based on the hydro climatic characteristics of the countries within the ea region which has not been applied in earlier investigations 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 hydrological datasets tws represents the combined total of all forms of water stored above and below the land surface there are two ways of tws data products direct from satellite monitoring and hydrological model simulation datasets the change in tws in the ea region includes soil moisture sm surface runoff sr and groundwater storage gw the monthly scale simulated tws was derived by vertically integrating the stored surface and subsurface water storage tws derived from gravity recovery and climate experiment grace rl06 mascon solutions was used to evaluate the simulated tws changes from april 2002 to december 2020 the grace satellite mission tapley et al 2004 and its successor mission grace follow on flechtner et al 2016 kornfeld et al 2019 was the first dedicated satellite time variable gravity mission and provides an alternative and unique approach for monitoring large scale mass changes in the earth system we use the latest version of the grace solution due to several advantages related to the spherical harmonics sh solutions these includes less leakage error suitable to use basin level and can be used without any post processing save et al 2016 wiese et al 2016 and is suitable for obtaining more detailed surface mass changes than sh solutions li et al 2022 which is required to understand water storage characteristics on another note xiang et al 2022 recently found that destriping of mascons can be imperfect in some areas of the world which must be considered in the interpretation of results recent studies suggest estimating the long time tws change by filling in the missing grace and grace follow on grace fo data our study region is approximately 6472 404 km2 which is large enough to be observed by grace mission satellites we also processed grace data at the basin scale in tana abaya chamo turkana victoria and tanganyika basins separately to identify the main driving component of water storage change the uncertainty of basin scale grace tws data was estimated by applying grace processing truncation and filtering to simulated sm from the global land data assimilation system gldas crowley et al 2008 ferreira et al 2014 xie et al 2012 in addition to direct tws monitoring from grace there are many other hydrological models including gldas wghm swat and pcr globwb providing tws components biancamaria et al 2019 gldas and swat were used in this work gldas is an uncoupled land surface modeling system that drives multiple models runs globally at the resolution of 0 25 and produces results in near real time the monthly hydrological fluxes variables sm et p and sr were applied from gldas to estimate the basin s water balance rodell et al 2004 the variables are used to address the variations of water storage components gldas drives four land surface models mosaic community land model clm noah and variable infiltration capacity vic we used the noah land surface model of gldas water storage because the tws estimated from the noah ensemble means good agreement with grace derived tws mo et al 2016 its purpose is to ingest satellite and ground based observations using advanced land surface modeling and data assimilation techniques to generate optimal fields of land surface states and fluxes in this study groundwater is represented by estimated gws derived from water balance component which includes soil moisture change sm and surface water change sr data to estimate gws eq 4 gldas water storage without groundwater component can be combined with estimated gws satellite altimetry dataset provides lake level variations computed from topex poseidon t p jason 1 altimetry provided by the united states department of agriculture usda was used to analyze surface water storage in the lake basins the data covering 2002 2020 were used in to analyze the lake level height variation 2 2 2 climate forcing input data to better understand the tws anomaly twsa variation we used three climates variables of the climatic research unit time series cru a monthly gridded climate temperature and precipitation dataset time series dataset from 2000 to 2019 with 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution for consistent spatial resolution hydrological data the 0 5 data observation was effectively downscaled to 0 25 using gldas output data to investigate the relationship between water storage variation and climate factors this climate data was investigated for relationships between twsa and climate variables and the control factors affecting the twsa variations for the swat model simulation meteorological data such as precipitation and temperature daily time series dataset from 2000 to 2020 digital elevation model dem land use and soil were used to be consistent with the temporal resolution table 1 2 3 methods the detailed methodological flow and analytical data structure adopted for this study is presented in fig 2 the grace derived twsa was used to identify annual and seasonal tws variabilities in the ea region specifically in the lake basins of lake victoria lake turkana lake tana lake abaya chamo and lake tanganyika the obtained monthly twsa and water balance components derived from gldas output are used to examine tws change based on the combined analysis of grace measurement twsa the gldas model dataset and hydrological modeling the grace derived twsa were re constructed to 0 25 spatial resolutions and basin level spatial average was evaluated we also the inter annual trends were derived from seasonal and trend decomposition using loess stl the overall methods of the study are presented in detail in the methodological sections below 2 3 1 singular spectrum analysis algorithm the spatio temporal dispersion of the missing grace derived tws data in time series and between two missions grace and grace fo is shown the missing data were filled in using the single spectral analysis ssa method dividing time series into components ordered by variance intensity vautard et al 1992 ssa is created based on singular value decomposition svd a well known factorization matrix process derived from the karhunen loeve decomposition theory of the principal component analysis method for analyzing one dimensional time series drazin et al 1992 the missing data were filled by adding two loops to the original ssa method and gradually updating the gap value this study follows a comprehensive methodology of grace derived tws data filling found in previous studies li et al 2019 wang et al 2021 yi and sneeuw 2021 the regional based missing data for 33 months from april 2002 to december 2020 fig 3 were filled using the ssa gap filling method in the mat lab script to test the ability and evaluate the performance of properly processing missing data an ssa gap filling method in the time series data the root mean square error rmse was used which is obtained with 1 r m s e i 1 n x i y i 2 n we have checked the consistency of ssa gap filling by using the rmse computed between the original tws derived from the water balance equation and the reconstructed data by the ssa algorithm along each pixel of the time series 2 3 2 calculation of long term spatio temporal tws variations the terrestrial water storage tws in the vertical integrations of water storage components considered a water balance approach for land hydrological applications in a specific region the change in tws equates to the difference between the two preceding and following months estimates grace derived tws data was investigated for tws change according to the water balance equation eq 2 the variation in tws includes a vertically integrated measurement of changes in groundwater storage Œ¥gws soil moisture storage Œ¥sms and surface water storage in rivers lakes and wetlands Œ¥sws snow and biomass due to the arid climate conditions snow and biomass storage contributions are negligible the tws was calculated using the three water storage components of monthly

methods several statistical methods were employed in this section to record effective signals and extract valuable information from our study results first for time series decomposition and uncertainty we used seasonal trend decomposition using loess stl for monthly time series decomposition jing et al 2019 robert et al 1990 the harmonic analysis approach to remove seasonality from the original data similar to the study by andrew et al 2017 which reported a valuable technique to estimate the time series trend of tws the stl method based on a locally weighted regression local regression decomposition approach consists of a sequence of smoothing operations of the time series tws data the decomposition method is applied based on locally weighted smoothing of deseasonalized time series the smoothing parameters are analytically optimized to minimize spectral leakage between high and low frequency components 5 s t o t a l s l o n g t e r m s s e a s o n a l i t y residuals where stotal is the original signal slong term is the long term trend sseasonality is the seasonality signal and residuals is the residual component the uncertainty of grace derived twsa was calculated from the residuals after removing long term trends and interannual annual and semiannual amplitudes as described in eq 6 the uncertainty in the data was derived by considering both measurement and leakage errors the uncertainty of the twsa component is determined from the sum of the standard deviation and monthly trend value the method coincides with the one by hasan et al 2019 and their linear trends were calculated respectively jing et al 2019 the uncertainty is calculated with 6 œÖ s t d t w s a i s t d t w s a t r e n d s i where œÖ is uncertainty of twsa std is standard deviation of twsa previous studies used this technique as a useful statistical tool for a dataset panda and wahr 2016 the null hypothesis of no correlation r 0 against the alternative hypothesis that there is a significant correlation is evaluated at the significance level p 0 05 unless the exact significance level p is mentioned moreover to understand the spatial evolution the spatial anomalies of hydro climatic variables are mapped using the inverse distance weighting method in the arcgis toolbox secondly we applied the mann kendall trend test m k test to identify trends from deseasonalized precipitation and the tws series computed as described by hamed 2008 we used the python programming language to analyze the temporal characteristics of hydrological and climate factors the kendall test is widely applied to detect trends in hydro climate data to calculate linear trends birara et al 2018 mishra et al 2010 hence the time series statistical analysis to estimate the trend of precipitation and tws in long term annual and seasonal distribution is determined using the mann kendall analysis however we derived the linear trend by using the linear least square method with the significance tested by the student s t test at the 95 p 0 05 and the 99 p 0 01 confidence levels 7 s i 1 n j 1 i 1 s i g n x i x j 8 s i g n x i x j 1 x i x j 0 0 x i x j 0 1 x i x j 0 and 9 z s n n 1 2 n 5 18 s 0 0 s 0 s 1 n n 1 2 n 5 18 s 0 if z is greater than 0 the data shows an increasing trend if z is less than 0 the data shows a decreasing trend at z values greater than or equal to 1 28 1 64 and 2 32 the data passed the significant test reliability of 90 95 and 99 respectively the pearson correlation coefficient exhibits the linear correlation between two variables giving a value between 1 and 1 if the value is less than 0 this implies a negative correlation between the two variables 10 r x y i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where r xy is simple linear correlation coefficient between the twsa variations and deriving factors xi is the twsa or twsa of the ith year yi is the driving factor results with p 0 05 were considered significant the magnitude of the trend estimated using theil sen s estimator by calculating the slope it is a robust trend statistical method used to calculate the median slopes and estimate the magnitude of a trend the magnitude is estimated by 11 s t w s m e d i a n t w s j t w s i t j t i j i where stws theil sen s median i and j are the time series sequences and xj and xi are the tws values at tj and ti respectively when stws 0 the tws in the corresponding pixel reveals an increasing trend when s tws 0 the tws in this pixel reveals a decreasing trend the significance test was explored using the man kendall test with p 0 05 the trend analysis was calculated with python 2 7 thirdly we used the empirical orthogonal function eof a common method to decompose time series of variable fields into two components the spatial component with no change over time and the temporal function that only considers temporal variations eof is a widely applied statistical method for analyzing large spatio temporal datasets bj√∂rnsson and venegas 1997 xie 2019 and performing a decomposition into dominant spatio temporal modes to reduce the input time series datasets to a smaller set of orthogonal patterns this method is consistent with the study zhu et al 2021 used to identify variability patterns in climate datasets the technique s basic attitude is to decompose the variable s empirical orthogonal function eofs uncorrelated in space principal components pcs are uncorrelated in time we can explore the data from the eofs and principal components as follows 12 y s t y t e o f 1 s p c 1 t e o f 2 s p c 2 t eof analysis was applied in this study to characterize the spatio temporal variation of tws anomaly and precipitation in the ea region mainly lake basin areas pc was carried out to derive the preferred storage variations described by the eof patterns the variance covariance data are primarily used to organize the technique they explain the variability and have orthogonal spatial patterns and uncorrelated time series navarra and simoncini 2010 the decomposition approach considers the processing by establishing that matrix x tends to spatial point values m and several observation values n at different temporal points p the expression is described as matrix x xij i 1 2 m j 1 2 n next the covariance matrix c xxt p is calculated then the matrix is decomposed orthogonally c e et then the eigen vector can be calculated to decompose the spatial domain orthogonally finally we have calculated the pcs pc e y as the corresponding main components in temporal change trends we employed the eof analysis concept used in hu et al 2014 and ndehedehe et al 2016 to quantify spatial climate variability patterns and analyse the dominant spatio temporal variability of tws and precipitation by considering regional tws change we identified regional tws change trends and spatio temporal patterns from decomposing grace tws data and precipitation data into sets of pcs and eofs this normalization method was computed using climate data operators cdo software and python 2 3 4 tws component estimation to estimate the influence of individual storage components in tws variation we determine the component contribution ratio ccr kim et al 2009 these were used to quantify the mean percentage contribution of the individual water storage component to the temporal variability of the tws derived from grace we evaluated surface water storage groundwater and soil moisture ccr is a ratio of mean absolute deviation mad of components to summed tws at each time t 13 c c r 1 t t 1 t m a d t w s t where t is the total length of the time series hydrological modeling is the second method we used to identify individual components that contribute to water storage variation the hydrological model is commonly developed for calculating the water balance component which has a great role in the spatio temporal variability of tws therefore a physically based hydrological model soil and water assessment tool swat was applied to project the impact on different water balance components of water resources across the lake basins of the ea region the swat model is a semi distributed continuous daily time step model that represents the main hydrological processes to predict basin hydrologic responses e g flow percolation infiltration using static topography soil and land use and meteorological inputs arnold et al 2000 the model has addressed different environmental issues particularly climate and land use change effects gassman et al 2007 in contrast we compared tws change from grace solutions between the gldas and the swat models the simulation of water budgets from 2002 to 2020 the water balance equations based on the swat model can be expressed as 14 Œ¥ s i p i a e t i w y l d i 15 w y l d i s r

discharge of the ith hydrologic response unit hru 3 results 3 1 spatio temporal variations distribution of tws in the ea region 3 1 1 long term spatial temporal variability in grace tws here we first examine how tws variations that occur seasonally and annually have evolved over the study period regionally fig 4 illustrates annual average tws changes in spatial patterns coefficient of variation cv and trends in the ea region from 2002 to 2020 fig 4a b and c represent changes in a annual spatial distribution b coefficient of variations and c the m k trend tests under historical conditions the magnitude of change in tws signal is maximum in the southwestern region at 220 mm yr equivalent to water height ewh or 1423 9 km3 yr in volume and the minimum magnitude is observed in the northern parts of the region at 100 mm yr ewh or 647 74 km3 yr in volume mainly over eritrea south and north sudan and the southeast of kenya with the maximum water storage reduction fig 4a overall it can be seen that the long term mean annual change in tws over the ea region reveals a decreasing trend from the central region to the northern parts which indicates that the tws anomaly is negatively correlated over the northern part of the sudan region these areas are mostly made up of dry land which has been dramatically exposed by desertification from fig 4 we observe that the change reflects a strong spatial heterogeneity in tws changes across the region the long term monthly regional mean tws and its linear trend were calculated using the grace and gldas solutions expressed in mm month in the ea as shown in fig 5 the pearson correlation coefficients r2 analysis shows that twss change is significantly correlated with grace derived and gldas estimated in the ea region with an r2 value of 0 54 overall fig 5 shows the linear trend of tws changes in spatial mean over the region with a slight increase of 42 4 mm yr or about 276 2 km3 yr since the distributed tws fluctuated throughout the entire study period 2002 2020 the period was divided into four sub periods i e 2002 2006 2007 2011 2012 2016 and 2017 2020 to explore more details on the pattern of the changes the change in tws showed a slightly decreasing trend with a loss of 3 50 mm yr 22 66 km3 yr from 2002 to 2006 and 2 95 mm yr 19 089 km3 yr from 2012 to 2016 respectively on the other hand the tws changes showed a moderately increasing 1 33 mm yr 8 61 km3 yr from 2007 to 2011 and a sharp increase after 2017 with 60 99 mm yr 394 72 km3 yr overall we used precipitation p evapotranspiration et runoff r and temperature t to verify the grace derived tws change based on the water balance closure explicitly tws decreased during 2005 2006 and mid 2016 the long term dry condition corresponds to persistent negative precipitation surface runoff anomalies and apparent tws slightly increased in the periods after 2019 which is attributed to positive precipitation anomalies from long term monthly time series anomalies fig 6a b as well as a significant decline in temperature and et anomalies fig 6c d the drought event process is consistent with water deficits from 2005 to 2006 and 2016 caused largely by persistent precipitation runoff reduction and the increment of et these are consistent with the study conducted by forootan et al 2019 who indicated that precipitation contributes to the overall water balance and directly affects the tws variations and volumes as indicated here precipitation dominantly boosts water storage and et and temperature have opposite features whereas surface runoff integrates with precipitation and et fig 6 shows the change rate of annual precipitation runoff et and temperature which are significant climate factors that trigger the variability conditions of tws at the regional scale 3 1 2 seasonal spatial variability in tws the changes in the seasonal cycle of tws vary spatially among regions as estimated by grace derived tws datasets from 2002 to 2020 using eq 1 fig 7 with significant increases and decreasing patterns that amplify the regional water resources changes the change in seasonal tws is observed in different patterns between the southwest northwest and east of ea overall fig 7 shows the seasonal spatial distribution of estimated tws change showing 38 9 mm yr 251 8 km3 yr and 18 9 mm yr 122 8 km3 yr during the djf and mam seasons respectively on the other hand tws change showed a negative value of 50 3 mm yr 325 7 km3 yr and 7 55 mm yr 48 9 km3 yr in jja and son respectively in addition the seasonal trend analysis of tws change was carried out using the mann kendall trends z statistics and sen s slope estimator q for the magnitude of trends the result of the seasonal trends analysis is shown in table 2 the mam and jja seasons are showing a negative change with z statistic values of 1 98 and 0 18 and sen s slopes of 0 26 and 0 031 mm yr respectively while djf and son show positive change with z statistic values of 2 9 and 1 08 and sen s slopes of 0 32 and 0 16 mm yr respectively fig 7 shows the temporal regional averaged changes in tws anomalies precipitation et anomalies and soil moisture in all seasons djf mam jja son over the ea region from 2002 to 2020 the temporal pattern is attained according to the derived seasonal signals by exploring the intra annual distributions of tws et and precipitation the tws amplitude and sign of the anomalies advocate that jja and son seasons have maximum water storage losses in 2005 2006 and 2016 modulated by high et and precipitation reduction in mam season respectively these contribute to mam season precipitation and et influencing the inter annual surface and subsurface components of hydrological cycles however the jja season precipitation shows a high loss which modulates the trend in water storage variability generally the long term trend analysis in seasonal tws showed a non significant change which exhibited statistically significant at the 95 confidence level positive tws trends in the region fig 8 3 1 3 components contribution to tws changes in the ea region based on simulated sms from noah land surface models lsms in the gldas and monitored sr changes from satellite altimetry gws was estimated using eq 4 the long time trend of gws was significantly increasing with 13 mm yr from 2002 to 2020 on the other hand sm and sr have significantly decreasing trends of 5 8 and 2 3 mm yr respectively on a regional scale ccr was investigated and calculated by eq 13 to estimate the contribution of water balance components to tws change from the used water balance components ccr in the region the contributions of gws sm and sr to tws change are 42 29 and 20 respectively in the ea region it was concluded that the gw contribution is dominant in water storage variation at the ea region level 3 2 lake basins tws variations and trend analysis here we first examine how tws variation and its trends changed over lake basins over our study period from 2002 2020 we calculated the spatial and temporal change trends of the tws in each lake basin fig 10 we selected five lake basins lake tana basin ltb abaya chamo lake basin aclb turkana lake basin tulb lake victoria basin lvb and tanganyika lake basin tlb to study the spatial and temporal variation of tws we used the theil sen median analysis method eq 11 to calculate the long term monthly tws change trend in the lake basins the results obtained the lowest water storage ranges in ltb and aclb whereas tulb lvb and tlb obtained the largest variation range the change in tws indicated the increasing tendency over the lvb fig 10 also shows a decreasing tendency of trends in the southern lvb tlb ltb and northern parts of aclb and tulb according to the spatio temporal variable characteristics shown in figs 9 and 10 twsa tends to increase in all lake basins we applied change in annual trend analysis of tws calculated in the lake basins fig 11 using the mann kendall trend test the water storage variations have shown significant increases in victoria and tanganyika basins 0 85 and 0 605 mm yr respectively but moderate in turkana abaya chamo and tana lake basins 0 533 0 49 0 27 mm yr respectively fig 11 these results were consistent with the finding by hassan et al 2014 some studies have indicated that water hyacinth which covers 30 of the lake area solomon 2017 blocks the hydrological cycles over the lake area influencing the lake water storage change the rate of water storage variation in the victoria basin is higher than in all the other lake basins with an annual trend rate 97 5 28 2 mm yr tws extremely decreased from 2002 to 2006 approximately between 1 and 3 mm yr these decreasing values could be attributed to severe drought events the annual trend is shown as water storage change providing a more reliable representation of twsc in the basin fig 11 illustrates the increasing trend in lake basin water storage with a clear increment in the grace data especially after 2018 in all lake basin areas which shows the influence of heavy rainfall and unexpected silt deposits from the tributary river basins however from 2002 to 2006 all lake basins had a decreasing trend related to the drought event these results match those observed earlier hassan et al 2014 the increment does not show that the lake water volume is increasing and lake water volume estimation is not calculated in this study 3 2 1 the seasonal tws change analysis to examine and understand the seasonal and annual fluctuations of surface water in the lake basins we analyzed basin averaged changes of tws and climate forcing variables in whole seasons the long term trend analysis in seasonal water storage change showed a significant trend in lake victoria and abaya chamo basins in all seasons while the long term tws change has shown a significant trend towards increase observed during jja mam and djf in lake tana turkana and tanganyika basins respectively see supplementary table s 1 a non significant trend is observed during djf and mam in lake tanganyika basin in lake tana abaya chamo and lake turkana basins seasonal tws change shows a negative tendency in djf with 4 2 4 7 and 13 5 km3 yr and mam with 1 8 0 8 and 4 8 km3 yr while in victoria and tanganyika lake basins the negative tendency is explored in jja with 13 78 and 75 1 km3 yr respectively and in son season showed 3 29 and 47 1 km3 yr respectively these showed a significant agreement with the climate distributions of the basin 3 2 2 connection of lakes basin tws changes and hydrological fluxes the temporal correlation between tws and rainfall exhibited a remarkable lag correlation corresponding to the lake basins see supplementary fig s 4 fig s 4 shows that tws lags behind rainfall for approximately 2 3 months in the lake basins the lag correlation influences the seasonal and annual water storage patterns from table 3 the correlation coefficients cc between hydrological fluxes et and tws anomaly over all lake basins were approximately 0 51 with the p value less than 0 001 which indicates et greatly influences the lake water storage variability the sr and et were correlated well to grace tws with high ccs of 0 80 and 0 7 respectively in the tana lake basin the correlation between precipitation and tws is quantified with lagged cc and the result is shown in table 3 the one month lag correlation between grace tws and prcp in abaya chamo lake was negatively correlated cc 0 03 in table 4 lists the summarized correlation root means square error and mean error between grace tws and gldas tws during the dry and wet season respectively to address discrepancies in lake basins the cc between grace and gldas in the wet season is lowest in the victoria lake basin cc 0 18 and the highest is in the lake tana basin cc 0 77 although it is lowest in victoria cc 0 01 and highest in lake tana cc 0 55 in the dry season compared with the regional seasonal climate influence gldas tws underestimates grace derived tws in the tana lake basin and overestimates it in the tanganyika lake basin in the dry season with mean errors of 2 05 and 6 51 respectively the maximum mean error of gldas tws against grace twsa in the tanganyika basin exhibits the influence of gws the results showed that precipitation has stronger interannual variability in the tana lake basin and tanganyika lake basin in contrast the cc between grace and gldas in the wet season of the abaya chamo lake basin is the lowest cc 0 37 compared with those in the dry season cc 0 54 which indicates that low cc is low between grace and gldas mainly attributed to low cc values in the wet season 3 3 identifying key water balance components to tws change 3 3 1 components contribution to tws changes in the lake basins we applied the same approaches in section 3 1 4 over each lake basin to identify the individual water balance component contribution to water storage change the result shown in table 5 shows that gws is the dominant component in the abaya chamo turkana and victoria lake basins with ccr values of 48 53 and 46 respectively with a long time trend significantly increasing with at least 0 76 mm yr sr is the main water balance component that alters the water storage change over lake tana and tanganyika basins with ccr values of 52 and 35 with long time trend of non significant change with 0 001 and 0 001 mm yr respectively 3 3 2 water balance components from swat model the inter annual temporal correlation between the tws anomaly and the climate variables over the lake basin areas of the ea region is strong we have analyzed our correlation using the most driving components that influence the water storage changes like precipitation evapotranspiration and surface runoff the correlation in fig 12 illustrates temporal variations of the time series of annual tws anomaly and the hydro climatological variables over the lake basins the water balance components are estimated from swat hydrological modeling simulated monthly over the lake basin areas using eq 14 15 fig 12 illustrates the swat simulation analysis results that describe the water balance components showing an apparent annual water storage variability the swat model simulation work here mainly aims to identify the most sensitive parameter that will alter the change in tws over the entire basin the simulation result was correlated with the tws increase in the lake basins which was detected starting in 2018 in all lake basins the result showed the swat model estimated gw recharge dominantly alters the tws of abaya chamo turkana and victoria lake basin with cc values of 0 74 0 63 and 0 79 respectively while soil water et and sr were key components that dominated the estimated cc value of 0 41 0 29 and 0 49 respectively over tana lake basin additionally the swat model estimated the water balance components in the southern parts of victoria which is the tanganyika basin and found that gw and sr are the main contributing components showing water storage variability this is in contrast to research findings indicating that land cover change influences the variability of tws over the ea region lake basin areas we come back to that in detail in the discussion section 3 4 spatio temporal patterns of twsa determined by pca method fig 13 shows the pca decomposition of tws over east africa the first pca mode which explains 76 3 of the variance represents the annual variability of tws changes in the region the first pca mode of change in tws shows the strongest annual variability over the northwestern parts of the region and to a lesser extent over northeastern furthermore eof1 and its corresponding pcs shows an increasing trend in tws change over the ea for the study period the second eof and its corresponding pc shows 11 5 of the annual tws variability fig s 3 illustrates the tws spatial array of the first two eof s estimated for the wet season jjas mam and ond eof1 and eof2 describe 76 3 and 11 5 respectively of the variability and show a significantly high value in the central and northern parts of the region indicating impacts on jjas season water storage distribution over the ea region to further analyze the spatial distribution patterns of seasonal cycle tws change and precipitation over the lake basins the main rain fall seasons were selected from june to september jjas with a long rain season and march to may mam with a short rain season the result obtained from the time series analysis of pca shows that two extreme conditions exist over lake tana abaya chamo and lake turkana basins during the jjas season average precipitation fig 14 a the values are hydrologically indicative of floods and droughts over the basins which can have a big impact on how much water is stored interestingly the pca shows the same conditions over the victoria and tanganyika lake basins during the long rain season mam of the ea region with a remarkable declining drought condition fig 14 b which declares that the mam rainfall has an insignificant influence on the tws change however the long term monthly tws change showed remarkable agreements with the seasonal precipitation due to the lag correlation effect 4 discussion we investigated at how tws changed from 2002 2020 in different parts of the ea region and we provided a map that shows how that changed over time changes in tws result in a decrease in precipitation and mitigate future hydrological and climate variability impacts leading to water storage changes there is a general tendency to focus on extreme events and more intensive farming as sources of tws variability hassan et al 2014 besides comparing the change in tws and the validity of our hypothesis the contributions of the fundamental water balance component of tws variations were quantified using the ccr and swat model and the method was configured at the regional and basin level the ccr provided the gw estimated at 42 of the total tws in the ea region while sm and sr contributed only 29 and 20 of the total tws respectively this indicates that gw mainly dominates the total discharge of water storage through the region on the lake basin level lake tana abaya chamo turkana victoria and tanganyika basins ccr was identified as inconsistent with the regional domain chao et al 2021 estimated that gw contributes 48 to the tws in the yangtze river basin and sm and sr contribute 25 and 12 respectively to the total tws this roughly agrees to our values although it concerns a completely different environment in contrast to a large proportion of these studies the contribution of individual components was estimated sr is dominant with ccr of 57 43 and 38 in lake tana victoria and the tanganyika basins respectively hassan et al 2014 support our finding which estimated that surface runoff and soil moisture content are the key components in lake tanganyika victoria and malawi this dominancy of surface runoff is due to the basins rainfall variability and topographic conditions while gw contributes 53 and 48 in the lake turkana and abaya chamo basin respectively it is similar to regional water balance component estimation in addition the study estimated the component contributions using the hydrological swat model at the lake basin level the result showed that the swat model estimated gw recharge significantly altered the tws of abaya chamo turkana and victoria lake basins with cc values of 0 74 0 63 and 0 79 respectively while soil water et and sr were key components that dominated the estimated cc values of 0 35 0 41 and 0 55 respectively in the lake tana basin the water storage changed in the basin this method is consistent with previous studies houphou√´t boigny and lom√© 2020 which used the swat model to estimate water balance components in west africa at the same time the lake tana basin shows that precipitation is the most fundamental water balance component influencing water storage variability which is the major recharging source of water resources andualem et al 2020 dessie et al 2014 worqlul et al 2018 remarkably groundwater also influences the water storage change over the turkana lake basin severely influenced by active tectonic geology and groundwater linkage the result coincides with the finding of a previous study bo√´s et al 2019 which identified lake sediments with dated horizons constraining basin dynamics fig 12 b shows again that swat can detect an important tws component in the lake abaya chamo basin precipitation is significantly influencing key components of the variability of tws furthermore the increasing surface and subsurface runoff over the basin over time indicates that another variable influences the variability of tws the finding is supported by gebeyehu et al 2019 who predicted agricultural ecological and hydrological processes the basin has a high temperate zone with a bimodal rainfall season land use land cover change has affected water resources woldeyohannes et al 2018 in the victoria lake basin fig 12 c tws declined significantly in 2006 influenced by et which dominantly controlled the variability our findings are supported by earlier studies e g sewagudde 2009 who considered the effect of the drought that persisted between 2003 and 2006 in the region however similar to the other lake areas in 2019 and 2020 the basin has a high tws trend mainly indicating the influence of rainfall at the same time the direct fluctuation trend of all water balance components shows their direct influence on the variability of annual twsa globally many studies have reported an abrupt reduction of water volume with abnormal sediment deposits causing flooding which is consistent with our results for example in lake michigan and huron heavy rainfall and higher water levels are seen in 2019 and 2020 leading to erosion and flooding along with many parts of the great lake shoreline carter and steinschneider 2018 in recent decades the rapid decline in lake tws volume has been a growing concern creating a global movement towards establishing rehabilitation work since then there has been a need to develop a framework that assists in informed decision making the eofs analysis efficiently extracted large scale spatial patterns of precipitation derived from cru for the ea regions the test result shows the first two eofs separately and we used the first two most variable indicators efficiently eofs analysis has the advantage of illustrating the main spatial pattern of variability the first pca mode which explains 76 3 of the variance represents the region s annual variability of tws changes fig 13 the time series analysis pcs shows the observable extreme in this study we have seen two extreme rainfall season tws patterns over the lake basins areas the findings in fig 14 a show that jjas season rainfall primarily influences lake tana lake abaya chamo and the lake turkana basins all of which were affected by drought 2008 2007 and 2017 however there were flooding events in 2015 2014 and 2006 in lake tana abaya chamo and turkana basins the mam rainfall season tws pattern over the lake basins was also investigated fig 14b these results mainly show extreme events over the two lake basins lake victoria and lake tanganyika the estimated extreme flooding events occurred in 2005 and 2008 respectively the result tells us the fluctuation of tws over the basin due to climate and anthropogenic activity inconsistent with our results the pattern showed flooding events for both lake basins in 2020 this study delivered a fruitful observation and model based results can be linked to assess the statistical relationships of water balance components and open directions to examine how future changes in tws might offset drought impacts hopefully this study will provide valuable insight into lake basins available water resources management using an emerging remote sensing dataset 5 conclusions and perspectives this study investigated the spatio temporal variations of tws and its driving components across the ea region and lake basins scale from the perspectives of water storage components and water fluxes the results indicated a slight fluctuation of the annual average spatial tws especially in the south west which increased by 220 mm yr ewh or 1423 9 km3 yr in volume in the northern part tws decreased by 100 mm yr ewh or 647 74 km3 yr in volume climatic factors mainly caused theses variations as for the temporal change in tws unusual fluctuation patterns were observed with a significant decrease in 2005 2006 and 2016 and a slight increase after 2017 however at the regional scale long term seasonal twsc tends to be non significant across the ea region the variations of lake basin level water storage are significant in victoria and tanganyika basins 0 85 and 0 605 mm yr respectively but moderate in turkana 0 533 mm yr abaya chamo 0 49 mm yr and tana basins 0 27 mm yr a strong long term trend was found among seasonal tws changes in lake tana turkana and tanganyika basins showing a significantly increase during jja mam and djf pearson correlation coefficients r2 0 54 showed twss had a significant correlation with grace derived and gldas estimated in the ea region based on the ccr and data used in this study the relative contributions of individual tws components in the ea region and the lake basins revealed new insights for understanding the distributions of water resources the ccr investigation in the whole ea region found gw contribution to the tws variations was 42 while sm and sr contributions were 29 and 20 respectively in the lake basins gw is the main contributor in lake turkana abaya chamo and victoria basins with ccr of 48 53 and 46 respectively however in the lake tana and tanganyika basins sr was proven to be the dominant component accounting for 57 and 38 respectively the swat model established a strong correlation between water balance components for the lake basins and the tws in all basins the two methods ccr and swat model used to estimate the components could be applied to other lake basins globally eofs analysis was utilized to identify the spatio temporal patterns of tws change and seasonal precipitation based on decomposition s regional remote sensing database the first two eofs employed to explain the annual and seasonal variability demonstrated that seasonal water storage distribution is strongly correlated to precipitation this study used twsc estimation in connection with climate teleconnection which could be important to predict the impact of droughts on water yields it provides guidelines to investigate serious water management issues using grace twsa data overall the results provide information to better understand water resources potentials and controlling measures however there exist some uncertainties and scarcity of in situ data in large scale regional based datasets for estimating tws changes estimating the influence of extreme climate events on water storage and providing appropriate mitigation measures over the lake basin should be a priority for future studies credit authorship contribution statement ayalkibet m seka conceptualization validation formal analysis

geochemistry 1 introduction the alberta oil sands region aosr which comprises an area of 142 000 km2 located in the boreal forest of northeastern alberta constitutes the largest energy reserve in canada and third largest in the world with over 165 billion barrels of proven bitumen reserves canadian association of petroleum producers capp 2018 the aosr is comprised of three regulatory districts established by the alberta energy regulator aer including athabasca cold lake beaver river clbr and peace river regions while a significant energy resource for the country there is a recognized need to ensure that current and future development of the petroleum resources do not pose significant risk to surface and groundwater quantity or quality as a critical component of the hydrological cycle groundwater supports a variety of ecosystems called groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes such as wetland fens i e the dominant land cover type in the aosr volik et al 2020 rivers i e groundwater provides 40 of flow to tributaries on the east bank of the lower athabasca river gibson et al 2016 lakes i e groundwater provides 5 20 of input to small headwater lakes schmidt et al 2010 and riparian zones groundwater also directly affects the health of humans in the aosr where it is used for domestic water supply and indirectly through human reliance on fish waterfowl berries plants and mammals harvested from gdes as part of alberta s efforts to ensure more sustainable development of oil sands resources groundwater management frameworks gwmf have been developed under the lower athabasca regional plan larp for three sub regions north athabasca oil sands naos south athabasca oil sands saos and cold lake beaver river clbr fig 1 with an overall objective to understand groundwater

2009a the importance of monitoring evaluating and reporting on potential impacts of oil sands development has prompted formation of a provincial federal oil sands monitoring osm program funded by industry and jointly designed implemented and overseen by environment and climate change canada and alberta environment and parks the program is mandated to include integrated reporting and regular assessment of environment condition to inform ongoing policy and management decisions government of alberta 2017 one of the aims of osm was to implement an adaptive management strategy by developing a perspective of baseline conditions based on water quality indicators and establishing a set of decision making triggers and limits that could be acted upon in cases where deleterious changes to the natural system are detected see nie and shultz 2012 the first phase of comprehensive groundwater monitoring in the oil sands region was initiated in 2009 and has proceeded annually amassing a

regional groundwater quality were recognized as important steps to advance the current understanding of groundwater characteristics variability and vulnerability across the aosr specific recommendations of the scientific review included interpretation of existing data in the context of proximity to development hydrogeological setting and natural variability to facilitate a rigorous

jasechko 2018 however a regional synthesis of water quality data from aquifers spanning the entire region has yet to be conducted the objective of this study was to compile groundwater quality data available for clbr naos and saos into a combined aosr dataset to interpret the new dataset in the context of conceptual hydrogeological models that describe potential impacts from mining and in situ oil sands activities across the region and to use the new combined aosr groundwater quality dataset to evaluate the efficacy of the current groundwater monitoring program the groundwater quality dataset was compiled and is used for the following purposes i to characterize the geochemical composition of each of the hydrostratigraphic units to better understand the variability of parameters across the aosr ii to compare the range and variability of parameters in the hydrostratigraphic units to interim triggers proposed by gwmf larp and iii to assess whether baseline results identify geochemical anomalies indicating vertical connectivity between aquifers that might require additional monitoring efforts the new regional dataset arising from our analysis is found to have many potential applications for water management in the region as we show it can be used to improve conceptual hydrogeological models for the area and demonstrates approaches to augment traditional groundwater monitoring in data sparse areas through statistical methods and using geochemical data to identify potential aquifer vulnerability 2 study area 2 1 oil sands activities economic bitumen deposits are largely emplaced within the cretaceous mcmurray formation situated at the base of mannville group strata fig 2 depth to the bitumen layer is the main determinant of whether surface mining or in situ methods are used the latter being required at depths below surface of greater than 75 m a range of specific impacts are associated with each type of extraction see s1 supplementary material mining impacts within the naos include dewatering of overburden depressurization of the basal mcmurray aquifer around the mine pits storage of tailings and disturbance to the landscape during development and eventually during reclamation depressurization of the basal mcmurray aquifer is needed for mine stability during excavation and reductions in hydraulic head in the mcmurray and overlying quaternary aquifers fig 2 may result in decreased groundwater contributions to some wetlands tributaries and the main stem of the athabasca river during the operational period these changes in hydraulic head could also alter groundwater flowpaths which could impact groundwater quality by changing the mixing between fresh and saline aquifers numerical groundwater modeling of the hydraulic head response in aquifers adjacent to surface mining over the duration of mine development operation and reclamation predict recovery to pre development levels after pumping for dewatering and depressurization is stopped e g frontier project teck 2011 potential leakage of contaminated process water containing elevated organic contaminants and metals from tailings ponds is another potential threat to groundwater quality water supplies for surface water operations are primarily obtained from the lower athabasca river although some basal mcmurray dewatering sources are also in use in situ extraction methods are typically used in areas where the mcmurray formation is present at greater than 75 m depth including parts of the naos and across the saos and clbr areas fig 2 bitumen is immobile at reservoir temperatures however when heated to 200 c it approaches the viscosity of water enhanced thermal recovery methods e g steam assisted gravity drainage sagd or cyclic steam stimulation css are used to increase the temperature of the bitumen to decrease its viscosity where oil sands are extracted using steam injection groundwater is used for steam production typically 0 4 0 5 m3 of water per m3 of bitumen produced hrudy et al 2010 the majority of this water is withdrawn from permeable cretaceous sandstone formations fig 2 with supplementary quantities taken from relatively deep unconsolidated sand and gravel deposits matrix 2012 heating of aquifer sediment adjacent to the injector wells can result in the release of metals and organics present naturally in the sediment both of which have the potential to affect groundwater quality in the immediate vicinity of operations 2 2 geological and hydrogeological setting the terrain of the aosr region is characterized by low lying plains 550 masl and adjacent broad rolling uplands 700 masl andriashek 2003 fig 1a in this boreal forest ecosystem where 50 of land cover is wetlands and the majority of those wetlands are fens that are sustained by groundwater alberta environment and parks aep 2018 large accumulations of peat and recent soils formed since the final retreat of the continental ice sheets around 10 000 15 000 years ago make up the region s surficial deposits surficial unconsolidated sediments also known as drift are comprised of tills lacustrine clays and fluvial sands and gravels of glacial and pre glacial origin typically ranging from 10 to 30 m thick note that drift deposits can exceed 100 m or more in deeply incised pre glacial and glacial channels eroded into bedrock fig 1a andriashek 2003 the thickness of the quaternary aquifers increases towards the south and in the saos and clbr there are thick sequences of neogene and quaternary sediments the quaternary aquifers in the clbr are well characterized across this region include alternating aquifer and aquitard units intersected by a network of pre glacial and glacial buried channels parks et al 2005 in the clbr the following quaternary hsu s are used for domestic supply grand centre sand river marie creek ethel lake bonnyville muriel lake and empress parks et al 2005 bedrock units are comprised mainly of lower cretaceous formations resting unconformably on upper devonian aged units fig 2 the sedimentary sequence dips to the southwest so the depth to the mcmurray formation becomes progressively deeper towards the southern portion of the study area and the subcropping units differ between the three oil sands sub regions fig 2 thus rivers within incised river valleys of the aosr have the potential for diffuse or localized e g springs interaction with groundwater from formations with different water quality along the river s course shale dominated formations of the colorado group cap the aquifers of the cretaceous mannville group which include in descending order the grand rapids mcmurray and clearwater formations these manville group aquifers are of particular interest since they are used as industrial low quality water sources the dissolution edge of the deeper prairie evaporite formation of middle devonian age forms a prominent structural feature in the aosr broughton 2013 2015 schneider and cotterill 2017 soluble salts e g halite and anhydrite have been removed in that interval which has led to formation collapse a reversal in the usual south west dip on the overlying mannville group formations creating a north easterly dip and formation of a structural trap for hydrocarbons these collapse features provide vertical connectivity between the devonian and the overlying mcmurray formation and are co located with areas of very high tds water in the mcmurray birks et al 2019 cowie et al 2015 the degree of connectivity is influenced by low permeability bitumen deposits in the mcmurray formation which can act as effective aquitards removing this bitumen barrier during operations can increase the potential for saline devonian groundwater to enter the mine pit walker et al 2017 the potential for cross formational groundwater flow also occurs near buried channels fig 1b eroded into and in one area through the underlying bedrock formations as deep as the upper devonian andriashek 2003 in general groundwater flows across the aosr are topographically controlled with more localized shallow groundwater flows originating from regional uplands such as the birch muskeg and stony mountains and flowing to adjacent lowlands incised channels and river valleys bachu 1996 bachu et al 1993 regional flow of deep groundwaters within cretaceous and older strata include deep basin brines originating at depth within the western canada sedimentary basin or glaciogenic brines originating from glacial waters undergoing pressurized recharge under the ice sheet grasby and chen 2005 the latter are commonly encountered in springs or seeps along the athabasca and clearwater rivers see s2 supplementary material 2 3 groundwater monitoring groundwater monitoring of various forms has been a recurring activity for decades in the oil sands region see s3 supplementary material although geochemical parameters and operational details have varied somewhat over time regional provincial groundwater monitoring efforts unrelated to oil sands development has included surveys conducted by the alberta geological survey ags and routine water quality monitoring conducted by the government of alberta s groundwater observation well network gown that was initiated in the 1970s and continued until the mid 1990s there was a monitoring hiatus for the gown that continued until resumption of surveys in 2008 clbr 2009 naos and 2012 saos groundwater quality data are still available for the hiatus due to site specific monitoring of groundwater conditions on and adjacent to active leases that oil sands operators were required to conduct to meet environmental protection and enhancement act epea conditions in the clbr area groundwater is widely used as a source of domestic drinking water so comprehensive groundwater quality data are available from alberta health ah assessments focused on drinking water quality government of alberta 2014 however each of the agencies involved in groundwater monitoring within the oil sands areas aep aer ah have operated according to their respective mandates and jurisdictions and monitoring decisions were generally made to satisfy the specific agencies own objectives 2 4 water quality indicators the types of water quality impacts expected from oil sands activities differs between mining and in situ operations so the gmwf identified different primary secondary and tertiary water quality indicators for each region table 1 primary and secondary indicators are measured on all groundwater samples whereas tertiary indicators are parameters that may be measured as part of investigations to determine the cause of water quality changes the gmwfs did not recommend specific stable or radiogenic isotopes but Œ¥18o Œ¥2h Œ¥13c dic Œ¥34s so4 and Œ¥18o so4 3h and 14c have been measured on selected oil sands monitoring wells to provide information about the sources and ages of water and solutes the gmwf identifies two types of thresholds for detecting changes in water quality triggers which are early warning signs of negative change from the natural variability in aquifer conditions and limits which are conditions beyond which the potential for impacts is considered unacceptable interim regional groundwater quality triggers were developed for each aquifer in the gwmf using oil sands monitoring well and baseline groundwater data to define upper and lower control triggers for the range of natural variability within each aquifer alberta environment and parks aep 2012 in addition to these regional triggers and limits as a part of the gwmf s management system temporal trend analysis on data from individual wells can be used to detect changes in groundwater quality that might occur without exceeding regional triggers or limits the spatial variability of water quality parameters across each aquifer or aquifer management unit makes selection of a single trigger value for each aquifer challenging matrix solutions inc matrix 2014a for this reason final trigger values and selection of the appropriate approach for establishing these limits e g aquifer wide limits vs limits for individual wells or clusters of wells has been postponed pending improved characterization of baseline conditions for each aquifer 3 methods 3 1 data sources this study includes compilation and interpretation of two types of groundwater data oil sands monitoring well mw data these data are from groundwater wells that were selected to be part of aep s oil sands regional groundwater monitoring network to support the osm program and larp gwmf this monitoring network included groundwater wells installed specifically for regional groundwater assessments and oil sands monitoring as well as data from groundwater wells owned by industry who sample and provide the data to aep baseline groundwater data this category of data included all other groundwater quality data from groundwater wells located in each of the regions which were installed and monitored to serve a wide range of applications e g industrial water supply wells domestic groundwater wells industry and government owned monitoring wells installed for non oil sands monitoring programs data from environmental impact assessments eias see s4 supplementary material for this study the term baseline refers to the regional aosr dataset extending from 1958 to 2015 recognizing that some of these data do not represent conditions prior to development the baseline data compiled here were used to evaluate the range of natural variability in hydrostratigraphic units across the region to represent the current state of regional groundwater quality against which future changes can be evaluated and to compare against the data from the oil sands groundwater monitoring wells note that hydrostratigraphic assignments that were adopted to intercompare all three sub regions are provided in s5 supplementary material the oil sands mw data were obtained for each of the three regions from aep and included groundwater wells identified as oil sands monitoring wells in the naos and saos and from a de facto network consisting of gown wells already undergoing monitoring in the clbr the baseline dataset included water quality databases assembled during development of the gwmfs for the three regions alberta environment and parks aep 2013a 2013b 2013c table 2 and were updated with water quality data available from eias see s4 supplementary material for full list and other publicly available datasets e g alberta health these baseline databases included previous provincial monitoring well data and water supply well data submitted as part of industrial and private well reporting however we should note that annual compliance data epea reporting were not available or included 3 2 field methods water quality qa qc and statistical treatment the mw and baseline water quality datasets were from a variety of programs each of which followed standard groundwater sampling protocols and used accredited laboratories but there was undoubtedly some variations in methods used between programs and over time the data were initially screened to remove data without sufficient metadata related to hydrostratigraphic formation or location and were then screened using quality assurance quality control criteria prior to inclusion in the current analysis out of the 27 000 groundwater samples available with water quality data approximately 15 000 met the qa qc criteria and were kept in the database after data cleaning of the geochemical parameters reported in the various databases fifteen of the primary and secondary indicator parameters were selected for statistical analysis na cl so4 tds no3 nh3 doc toc as b si naphthelene pyrene naphthenic acids and temperature statistical treatment of the compiled dataset included use of probabilistic bootstrap technique described in manchuk et al 2021 to model stable values quantify variance and uncertainty and identify temporal anomalies for selected water quality parameters the smoothed bootstrap approach was used to provide an estimate of the stable value of selected water quality parameters that was representative of a specified time interval such values are referred to as stable measured values since the smoothed bootstrap approach filters noise and mitigates outliers for each variable and monitoring well the five most recently available data points were used in the smoothed bootstrap approach to estimate the mean over the resulting window of time and to specify confidence intervals the statistical analysis determined stable values and temporal anomalies for fifteen indicator parameters for each hydrostratigraphic unit that were represented spatially using global ordinary kriging see s6 s8 supplementary material 4 results the combined mw and baseline database included data from the main hydrostratigraphic units used by the oil sands industry fig 3 and covers 1958 2014 fig 4 data from the surficial deposits channel deposits the grand rapids and mcmurray formation are presented here to represent key water supply aquifers for oil sands activities grand rapids and some channel deposits the formation where the majority of oil sands activities are occurring mcmurray formation and the aquifers that could be acting as conduits between the surface and deeper formations channel deposits figs 5 7 4 1 data density the spatial and temporal data density in the compiled dataset of oil sands mw and baseline data highlights differences in groundwater data availability in the main aquifers across the three main oil sands regions fig 3 and variations in monitoring effort that occurred over the programs history fig 4 there is a high density of baseline groundwater quality data available for surficial aquifers in the clbr due to the large numbers of domestic water supply wells in the southwestern portion of the study area fig 3a routine water quality parameters are available from the entire monitoring period but metals and organics were included in the analyzes in the more recent data fig 4 the availability of groundwater quality data from mws coincide with various provincial monitoring initiatives with increased efforts towards groundwater quality monitoring from the 2008 onwards 4 2 geochemical facies the major ion geochemical facies can be used to evaluate the degree of water rock interaction which can be used to infer information about the geochemical evolution and history of the groundwater figs 5 and 6 groundwater typically evolves geochemically along a flowpath from low tds ca hco3 type composition near recharge areas towards na hco3 or so4 dominated types in deeper aquifers with greater water rock interaction time and eventually to deep basin brines where the cl anion often dominates see freeze and cherry 1979 p 241 247 shifts in the dominant cations occur due to ion exchange and precipitation dissolution reactions that are dependent on the mineralogy of aquifer material along the flowpath in shallow aquifers the more soluble minerals have typically been removed from the shallow zone and only mineral phases with lower solubilities remain deeper into the flow system more soluble mineral phases may be present and dissolution of these phases can be influential in determining dominant ions quaternary hydrostratigraphic units showed a wide variety in major ion type classifications fig 5a b for the surficial sand aquifer baseline data show primarily mixed cation bicarbonate waters consistent with recent recharge however there were some wells with na cl baseline wells or so4 type waters baseline and mw which are more typical in deeper flow systems fig 5a the na cl type waters were sampled from wells in the northwestern portion of the surficial sands aquifer west of the athabasca river fig 6a none of the oil sands monitoring wells completed within quaternary units had na cl type compositions even though na cl type waters were identified in the baseline dataset the channel groundwater samples had fewer mixed cations type waters than the surficial sands and were dominated by ca to na consistent with ion exchange fig 5b there were isolated locations with na cl type waters in baseline samples along the gregoire channel in the saos and helina channel in the clbr which may indicate mixing with deeper formation waters where channels are incised into underlying cretaceous formations fig 6b grand rapids formation groundwaters had a ca na hco3 to na cl composition fig 5c this aquifer dips to the southwest and as a result has been eroded away completely in many areas of the naos and is present at increasing depths in the southwest the na cl type waters were found in the saos and clbr where the overlying colorado group aquitard has been removed north of the wiau channel or west of the christina river fig 6c ca mg hco3 type waters tend to occur in the northern extent of the aquifer and also had lower tds concentrations consistent with a shallower flow system fig 7c the wide range of geochemical facies in the mcmurray formation aquifer fig 5d are consistent with previous studies that have hypothesized that vertical connectivity between the mcmurray formation and the underlying saline devonian formations has resulted in widely varying salinity and water type cowie et al 2015 birks et al 2019 the mcmurray formation groundwaters range from ca hco3 type waters more consistent with shallow flow systems in the northern portion of the study region fig 6d to na cl waters sampled in some areas in the naos west of the athabasca river and in the saos in the saos there were isolated samples from the mcmurray formation with hco3 type waters fig 5d in most cases these samples were from groundwater wells located near the thalwegs of buried channels or near river valleys where there may be greater connectivity to shallow flow systems however methanogenesis and or bacterially mediated sulfate reduction can also lead to increased hco3 concentrations and a shift towards this water type 4 3 distribution of stable tds baseline values relative to oil sands mw data the estimated stable measured values that represent the most recently available samples taken from all mw and baseline wells combined are used as a best estimate of the stable values for each water quality parameter based on the combined oil sands groundwater database the modeled distribution of stable tds values provides a useful baseline with outliers and noise removed that can be applied to interpret the current distribution of oil sands mw values kriged stable values for tds shading on fig 7 are shown with control points used for the model indicated by circles and monitoring well data indicated by triangles maps are shown for the surficial sands channel aquifers grand rapids and mcmurray formations but similar maps were developed for each of the hydrostratigraphic units listed in table 2 the shading was only extended to areas with an estimation variance less than 0 9 to highlight areas with sufficient data to infer stable values the distribution of mw and baseline data across the surficial sands aquifer was sufficient to estimate stable values for most of the aquifer only a small portion of this aquifer did not have sufficient data to model stable tds concentrations fig 7a this aquifer had a fairly narrow range of tds concentrations 176 mg l to 3400 mg l compared to deeper units the northwest area of this aquifer contained the highest stable tds values according to the model and was where most of the na cl type waters were detected fig 6a the channel aquifers had a wider range of modeled tds values ranging from 164 mg l in buried channel aquifers in the naos to values approaching 7000 mg l in some deeper buried channel aquifers in the clbr area this aquifer category incorporates a wide range of depths e g drift thickness gregoire 100 m leismer channel 240 m kearl channel 25 70 m helina 50 100 m parks et al 2005 andriashek and atkinson 2007 and the wider range in tds appear to reflect depth of the various channel aquifers as well as tds in adjacent formations highest tds values were measured in groundwater wells in the helina channel fig 7b in contrast low tds in the naos channel aquifers and in the saos leismer channel are consistent with shallower occurrences where greater influence of recently recharged meteoric water would be expected large areas of the grand rapids formation had insufficient baseline data to model stable tds values fig 7c these areas were typically located away from oil sands development the lack of control points and oil sands monitoring well data available at the time of compilation 2015 indicate a need for improved characterization of this important water supply aquifer where data are available a trend of higher tds in the southern portion of this aquifer compared to the northern extent is evident fig 7c the wells with na cl type waters identified in fig 6c occurred in the saos and clbr areas where tds concentrations were higher the modeled stable tds values for the mcmurray formation show some limitations of kriging fig 7d related to the sparse distribution of data away from the central portion of the map the modeled stable tds values capture the higher tds values in the mcmurray formation west of the athabasca river in the naos compared to on the eastern side similar to patterns identified by both cowie et al 2015 and birks et al 2019 however the bootstrapping and variance criteria resulted in omission of some of the high tds groundwater data coinciding with the prairie evaporite dissolution scarp broughton 2013 this highlights one of the challenges in establishing baseline water quality distributions in a region with a high degree of spatial variability due to complex discontinuous geological features in such cases secondary information relating to geochemical sources would need to be included in the kriging equations as a drift term as an additional variable for cokriging or as a locally varying mean for example proximity to the dissolution scarp may be a valid secondary variable if it is found to have sufficient correlation with tds differences between the mw tds shading and the modeled stable values also highlight the challenge of working with water quality data that can be heterogeneous in some aquifers and hydrogeological settings within the region 4 4 spatial anomalies considering typical patterns for geochemical evolution of groundwater from recharge to discharge along flowpaths in sedimentary basins some geochemical indicators of vertical connectivity can be identified in the combined aosr database i e influence of shallow aquifer recharge at depth or indicators of discharge of deep groundwater sources in shallow aquifers in the surficial sands aquifer groundwater with anomalously high concentrations of tds and na cl water type were found near the confluence of the mckay and athabasca rivers in the naos likely indicating deeper more saline groundwater may be discharging at this location several anomalous groundwater compositions were encountered in the vicinity of buried channel aquifers including higher tds and na cl water type that could indicate greater mixing with the adjacent more saline formations in groundwater the gregoire beverly bronson and kikino channels in the grand rapids formation the hco3 type water fig 6 and low tds concentrations near the northern edges of the formation where the colorado group is thin or absent fig 7 suggest mixing with shallower flow the east west divide in tds concentrations and water type for the mcmurray formation aligns with the location of the devonian scarp and are consistent with greater connectivity with saline devonian aquifers near this feature cowie et al 2015 birks et al 2019 4 5 temporal anomalies temporal anomalies for a subset of parameters na cl so4 tds no3 nh3 doc toc as b si naphthelene pyrene naphthenic acids and temperature were evaluated in the combined mw and baseline dataset for each hydrostratigraphic unit and over each of the data rich time periods fig 8 sampling scores and temporal anomalies are shown for the periods before and after 1990 2003 and 2008 in fig 8 the sampling score is a measure of the uniformity of mw and baseline samples for a given indicator relative to the global distribution of the associated indicator and formation sampling scores with values 0 3 indicate a sampling bias either that the parameters is under or over represented for that hydrostratigraphic unit parameters with data from 1 well or with no data are also flagged the direction and significance of temporal anomalies are indicated by the color and thickness outline of each of the boxes in fig 8 the anomaly plots does not indicate any consistent trends in groundwater quality that are present in the entire region over the three time periods which is not surprising based on the discontinuous nature of the hydrostratigraphic units across the region comparison of water quality parameters before and after 1990 indicated primarily decreasing trends but before and after the 2003 and 2008 periods include more increasing or mixed trends comparison of data before and after 2008 indicated the fewest temporal anomalies with about half of them indicating decreases in concentration across the entire dataset sampling scores for naphthalene pyrene and naphthenic acid tended to have the greatest sampling bias likely because these organics are not part of routine water quality analyses and would only have been analyzed for selected wells note that temporal changes in routine field parameters such as ph temperature and redox were not given as much weight in the assessment since methodology used to acquire these data has the potential to influence the results and recognizing that there was little information available on whether consistent historical field and analytical practices were used for some parameters analytical detection limits may have improved over the time period covered by the dataset leading to detectable concentrations for parameters in more recent data that were previously below detection limits however most of the parameters with increasing trends fig 8 were for routine parameters e g tds cl na so4 no3 where significant changes in detection limits are not expected but this will be more thoroughly reviewed in follow up investigations the location of the temporal anomalies relative to hydrogeological features and potential groundwater stressors are also of interest and they were found to occur in distinct clusters in the naos saos and clbr areas fig 9 closer inspection of these clusters shows that all are located in areas where enhanced vertical connectivity due to the presence of buried channels incised rivers or where there is limited to no colorado group cover occur fig 9 the parameter scores within each of the clusters were used to identify the direction of changes in groundwater quality for indicator parameters in each hydrostratigraphic units summary tables in fig 9 parameter score plots for each anomaly are included in s9 supplementary material temporal anomaly 1 occurs in the naos in a group of wells screened in the surficial sands till and mcmurray formations in an area adjacent and east of the athabasca river where surface mining occurs this is an area where the mcmurray and devonian formations have high concentrations of solutes and these formations are directly overlain by quaternary sediments this area is also notable because it coincides with locations where there is evidence of natural saline groundwater seepage discharging to the athabasca river birks et al 2018 gibson et al 2013 gue et al 2015 the temporal anomalies included increasing trends in tds cl and no3 in the till and mcmurray formations as well as decreasing concentrations in so4 in the surficial sands till and mcmurray formations temporal anomaly 2 is in the naos and includes a small group of wells screened in the birch channel clearwater and mcmurray formations located over a buried quaternary channel at this location increases in no3 were observed in all three formations whereas dissolved as concentrations decreased temporal anomaly 3 includes a group of wells in the naos screened in the surficial sands mcmurray and devonian formations adjacent to the athabasca river and near the lewis and clark buried channel and characterized by trends of increasing concentrations of tds na cl and decreasing concentrations of naphthenic acids and so4 this area has previously been identified as a potential investigation area fig 1c for oil sands monitoring worleyparsons 2009b but there are currently no mw located in this area temporal anomalies in the mcmurray formation include increases in cl tds b and naphthenic acids and decreases in so4 temporal anomalies for as in the mcmurray formation are time dependant with increasing trends noted for 1990 and 2003 and decreasing trends after 2008 temporal anomaly 4 is located in the saos over the northern portion of the leismer channel in wells screened in undifferentiated overburden deposits and is the only temporal anomaly not located over an active oil sands lease this portion of the saos is located near the edge of colorado group cover at the margin where the grand rapids formation directly underlies quaternary deposits the changes in groundwater quality at this location include decreases in tds na so4 no3 and as and increases in cl and nh3 temporal anomaly 5 is located in the clbr area and includes a group of wells screened in the grand centre marie creek bonnyville and empress formations centered over the confluence of the helina sinclair and beverly channels in an area of in situ oil sands development fig 9 temporal anomalies were detected in the ethel lake formation a formation that has naturally elevated concentrations of as due to the presence of as bearing minerals moncur et al 2015a the changes in groundwater quality in these locations included increased concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc in all of the formations except the shallowest the grand centre formation 5 discussion analysis of the new compiled aosr dataset has provided better understanding of the range and spatial distribution of water quality parameters in the different hydrostratigraphic units across the region this information can be used to help refine conceptual models of groundwater flow birks et al 2019 to identify areas of aquifer connectivity and vulnerability and to provide insight into the establishment and applicability of water quality limits and triggers detection of spatial geochemical anomalies and areas with temporal changes in groundwater geochemistry may be helpful for identifying areas of greater cross aquifer connectivity to focus future sampling campaigns geochemical indicators of shallow groundwater flow in deep aquifers or the opposite pattern of geochemical indicators of deep groundwater in shallow aquifers may be a useful proxy for hydraulic connectivity between surface and underlying aquifers and can be a key indicator of potential vulnerability conversely where aquifers are poorly connected to surface or adjacent aquifers there may be a reduced likelihood that groundwaters are impacted by surface activities or contamination or that aquifer drawdown will affect groundwater reliant ecosystems 5 1 distribution of water quality parameters relative to hydrogeological controls the maps of stable water quality values e g fig 7 that have been developed from the new mw and baseline datasets provides an archive that can be checked against future values and to help identify potential areas for subsequent monitoring based on identifying areas with high uncertainty in the existing data the distribution of geochemical parameters in the surficial sands aquifer support the hypothesis that shallow aquifers are dominated by topographically driven groundwater flow from uplands to lowlands geochemical anomalies in this formation are interpreted as being the result of differing degrees of flow path interaction between shallow aquifers and the more saline underlying cretaceous formations topographically driven flow is also evident the distribution of tds and water type in the neogene and quaternary aquifers from the clbr area with lower values associated with recharge areas beneath the moostoos uplands and higher values observed progressively along the flow systems e g fig 5b increasing tds along helina channel the general trend of increasing dissolved solids along the flowpath appears to occur consistently as revealed by the baseline data higher tds and cl concentrations were also observed in aquifers in the southwest beaver river flow system in the whitefish uplands in some locations within the channel aquifers the composition of the groundwater is more consistent with deeper formation waters consistent with mixing with adjacent units some of the geochemical anomalies were detected in the baseline dataset that hasn t been as rigorously vetted as the groundwater mw data and so other factors e g well integrity sampling error influencing water quality cannot be excluded however these areas coincide with elevated values of mean stable tds fig 7 and cl we expect that this conclusion is not due to spurious data also several of the observed anomalies in major ion type fig 5 and tds fig 7 are present in approximately the same location within multiple aquifers bonnyville muriel lake and empress formations which strongly suggests that they are related not outliers the compiled oil sands mw and baseline data for some of the deeper cretaceous formations are considerably sparse although available results are consistent with recent geochemical and isotopic data that have recently been made available for the saos birks et al 2019 groundwater in the grand rapids formation increases in tds and shifts towards more na cl waters in the southwest portion of the aquifer where the formation is present at greater depths and overlain by a thicker colorado group cover birks et al 2019 this trend is evident in the compiled mw and baseline data and the new data compiled for this study has shown that this trend extends to the naos where even more dilute ca hco3 rich groundwaters are present consistent with their shallower depth and greater potential for mixing with overlying aquifers lower tds and more hco3 dominant groundwaters are found in the grand rapids formation near the christina river which was an area identified as having greater vertical connectivity based on the presence of glaciogenic isotopic signatures originating from the underlying devonian aquifers birks et al 2019 the importance of geochemical anomalies adjacent to buried channels is also evident e g hco3 dominant groundwaters present within deeper formations and cl dominant groundwaters in shallow formations the distribution of geochemical facies fig 6d and tds fig 7d in the mcmurray formation show the importance of vertical features especially the prairie evaporite dissolution scarp broughton 2013 cowie et al 2015 birks et al 2018 the stable tds values modeled for this formation highlights the challenge in establishing baseline values in areas with very heterogeneous water quality and sparse data vertical preferential flow features such as faults and dissolution scarps can create highly variable water quality distributions that are hard to detect with sparse networks and not suited for many interpolation methods 5 2 comparison with interim triggers the data in the compiled aosr database was used to look at the range of concentrations for the main indicator parameters defined under larp gwmf in each of the hydrostratigraphic units relative to the interim triggers currently in place for each region fig 10 supplemental material s3 there is a fairly narrow range in water quality parameters in most of the quaternary formations in the naos and saos fig 10a but greater ranges observed in the bedrock units fig 10b the clbr region had a very large quaternary water quality dataset due to the large number of wells located in this region and there were many outliers one prevalent trend is that of increasing na and cl concentrations with depth in the stratigraphic sequence from shallower grand centre to deeper empress formations the median values found for some parameters are higher than the interim triggers e g empress formation as tds na and so4 muriel lake as mcmurray formation naphthenic acids devonian naphthenic acids in the clbr naturally occurring as has been measured in groundwater from a number of the surficial deposits e g 180 Œºg l in buried channels moncur et al 2015a median naphthenic acid concentrations for mcmurray and devonian formations in the naos are higher than the interim trigger consistent with other measurements of groundwater from bitumen saturated portions of this formation kilgour et al 2019 the analysis of the new aosr dataset has highlighted the variability in individual aquifers and shown that in some aquifers even the median values are well above the interim triggers fig 10 the presence of highly variable and saline aquifers birks et al 2019 cowie et al 2015 gibson et al 2013 and glacial sediments with the potential to release metals during weathering parameters moncur et al 2015a are potential causes for the naturally high concentrations of some parameters and exceedances detected across the region 5 3 implications for oil sands groundwater monitoring network design there are many approaches for optimizing groundwater monitoring network design including simple random sampling stratified random sampling systematic grid sampling and random sampling within blocks gilbert 1987 alley 1993 however given the large size of the aosr 50 000 km2 and remoteness of some locations it is not economically or logistically feasible to implement high data density collection programs across all aquifers over the entire region so an approach for prioritizing areas based on vulnerability to potential impacts from oil sands activities is needed to help guide monitoring network design the original oil sands monitoring design for the naos and the saos used risk based modeling worleyparsons 2009b matrix solutions inc matrix 2013 to identify vulnerable areas based on proximity to oil sands activities and potential hydrogeological pathways connecting the surface to aquifers used for water sources this approach may not capture all of the potential risks from oil sands activities where some of the potential stressors occur at depth e g groundwater withdrawals and disposal and in complex hydrogeological settings where all of the potential hydrogeological pathways have not been well defined the interpretation of the new combined groundwater quality dataset show how temporal and spatial geochemical anomalies can be used as an additional source of information about potential groundwater vulnerability and connectivity spatial and temporal geochemical anomalies can indicate areas where groundwater conditions are changing or have been subject to interactions with overlying or underlying formations recently or in the past both of which are potential indicators of vulnerability the location of spatial geochemical anomalies section 4 4 and temporal geochemical anomalies section 4 5 were compiled and summarized on fig 11 to identify potential areas requiring additional monitoring areas of potential vulnerability can be identified based on indicators of cross formation mixing and using temporal trends in water quality temporal geochemical anomalies signify a change in the state of groundwater quality that can be from a variety of natural or anthropogenic stressors and can be used to identify areas for further investigation for example the temporal anomalies detected in the mw and baseline dataset could be due to a natural shifts in groundwater flow systems due to changes in recharge or changes in flow systems due to groundwater withdrawals by domestic or industrial users or due to contamination the spatial geochemical anomalies do not necessarily indicate influence of oil sands activities but indicators of vertical connectivity between shallow and deep formations suggest a more dynamic hydrogeological settings that may be more vulnerable to oil sands stressors the current distribution of oil sands monitoring network mws on fig 3 are summarized by hydrostratigraphic unit table 3 with reference to whether spatial or temporal anomalies have been identified to identify potential improvements to the network although the required number of observation wells needed to examine a system will ultimately depend on the objectives of the monitoring program and available budget approaches used in other regional programs include prescribing a minimum number of monitoring sites by aquifer or prescribing a sampling density by aquifer national groundwater water monitoring network ngwmn subcommittee on ground water of the advisory committee on water information 2013 the well density for the oil sands mw ranges from 1 well 311 km2 to 1 well 8694 km2 which can be compared to the us national groundwater monitoring program for principal aquifers where the well density ranges from 1 well 3 km2 to 1 well 82 288 km2 average density across entire program 1 well 5755 km2 subcommittee on ground water of the advisory committee on water information 2013 the grand rapids formation is the most heavily used aquifer for in situ water sourcing and this aquifer has fairly limited monitoring in the aosr with a density of 1 well 6868 km2 the limited number of regional mw that are operating in the saos fig 11 do not include the thousands of on lease monitoring wells that industry are required as part of regulatory compliance monitoring these industry owned wells are another source of monitoring data that could be further utilized for characterizing baseline groundwater quality conditions changes over time the results from numerical groundwater modeling done in eia s to predict the cumulative impacts of oil sands operators withdrawals and injections are another source of information that could be used to identify groundwater vulnerability that have not yet been fully utilized for monitoring design eias require predictions of the potential changes to the groundwater flow systems under full development conditions which are compared to base case scenarios with no development to identify potential environmental impacts to groundwater these predictions of the impacts from groundwater withdrawals e g changes to hydraulic head distributions around groundwater withdrawal and injection wells have not been compared to monitoring data and could be used to help guide monitoring network design examples of other monitoring programs around oil and gas activities e g colorado oil and gas association voluntary baseline groundwater quality sampling program colorado oil and gas association 2011 wheaton and donato 2004 entrix inc 2009 australia pacific lng 2012 australia pacific lng upstream project 2016 give insights into network design approaches that have worked in other resource development areas but they also highlight some of the specific challenges in groundwater monitoring in the aosr such as the large spatial extent remote access the discontinuous distribution of oil sands deposits the variety of resource development approaches surface mining vs in situ conducted by multiple different operators and the natural variability of groundwater quality due to discontinuous features like the prairie evaporite dissolution scarp and buried channels four of the five clusters of temporal anomalies occur in areas where oil sands activities coincide with areas of enhanced vertical connectivity due to buried channels or incised rivers and where adjacent formations have contrasting geochemical compositions fig 11 in most cases the areas with spatial and temporal geochemical anomalies had previously been identified as potential investigation areas and already have oil sands mws there are some interesting groupings in the geochemical parameters with increasing trends across the naos and clbr that are consistent with conceptual models of potential groundwater stressors in these regions decreasing trends in as concentrations were observed in a few of the temporal anomalies 2 3 and 4 and this could indicate a shift in redox conditions at these locations in the naos muskeg drainage and dewatering are needed prior to surface mine development nitrate in groundwater is typically associated with fertilizer use or septic system effluent but can also be released from drainage from peatlands wind mulder et al 1996 munir et al 2017 the increasing trend in no3 across all aquifers in the naos could be consistent with this potential effect of large scale peat drainage in the clbr area increasing trends in doc were identified in multiple wells in this area heating of quaternary sediments from the clbr has been found to result in increased tds and doc concentrations moncur et al 2015b however the increases in no3 and doc identified in the combined mw and baseline dataset could also be due to other natural or anthropogenic sources and more detailed causal investigations including review of the mw data and expanded set of water quality parameters in these areas would be required 6 conclusions given the large size of the aosr and remoteness of some locations it is not feasible to collect groundwater data at high spatial resolutions so methods including spatial and temporal data analyses can improve our ability to assess groundwater quality in these data sparse areas approaches are needed to identify and prioritize groundwater aquifers most vulnerable to impacts from oil sands developments overlaying spatial and temporal anomalies can assist to characterize aquifer connectivity and other approaches such as vulnerability mapping ideally using the results of groundwater modeling can be used to identify potential new oil sands groundwater monitoring locations the interpretation of the combined aosr groundwater geochemistry dataset provides support that conceptual models of vulnerability guiding the initial selection of mw locations appear valid the focus on areas where the colorado group aquitard is absent due to incised rivers or buried channels is considered appropriate the results of comparisons between the new aosr database and the interim triggers in the naos saos and clbr provides strong support for the idea that aquifer based triggers and limits may not be suitable for groundwater monitoring in the aosr especially given the limited amount of available data in some aquifers single number triggers or limits for large and heterogeneous aquifers may not be representative of the entire aquifer and it is recommended that approaches that account for wide range in aquifer quality such as well specific limits of change or limits more closely linked to geological mapping should be explored the newly compiled aosr baseline database has highlighted the value of groundwater quality data originally collected for other purposes to define baseline conditions at a regional scale provided that the associated metadata contain reliable information about completions and hydrostratigraphic units and that data are required to pass the appropriate qa qc screening large volumes of groundwater quality data collected for other regulatory and monitoring purposes e g epea compliance monitoring applications for water use permits domestic water well data are likely to be an extremely valuable data source of baseline and timeseries information one that is complementary to operation of a dedicated set of groundwater monitoring reference wells that are sampled and maintained by the appropriate monitoring agency additional recommendations for enhancing understanding of regional groundwater quality in the aosr include continued groundwater monitoring with expansion coverage in the central area and in regions with high potential for surface water groundwater interaction collection of a consistent set of water quality parameters and recurring database maintenance updates and analysis appropriate statistical techniques such as bootstrapping manchuk et al 2021 can remove anomalous data points and can be extremely valuable for incorporating these large regional datasets into distilled baseline data products this assessment of a regional groundwater dataset from the aosr highlights the challenges of groundwater monitoring in an area with diverse resource development activities associated with establishing baseline water quality distributions in a region with a high degree of spatial variability due to discontinuous geological features as a foundational step of adaptive monitoring this study improved understanding of baseline groundwater quality in the aosr conditions by statistically defining and spatially mapping baseline water quality conditions in the naos saos and clbr sub regions for a subset of the primary and secondary water quality indicators in the larp gwmf such as tds due to data limitations there are still some areas where baseline groundwater quality has yet to be defined e g for some parameters in some aquifers as well as in the peace river region changes in groundwater quality over time were observed in 5 areas 3 in the naos one in the saos and one in the clbr confirmation of groundwater quality changes and investigation of cause are recommended as next steps to ensure that current and future development of oil sands resources do not pose a significant risk to groundwater and the connected groundwater dependent ecosystems further characterization of regional baseline and natural

geochemistry 1 introduction the alberta oil sands region aosr which comprises an area of 142 000 km2 located in the boreal forest of northeastern alberta constitutes the largest energy reserve in canada and third largest in the world with over 165 billion barrels of proven bitumen reserves canadian association of petroleum producers capp 2018 the aosr is comprised of three regulatory districts established by the alberta energy regulator aer including athabasca cold lake beaver river clbr and peace river regions while a significant energy resource for the country there is a recognized need to ensure that current and future development of the petroleum resources do not pose significant risk to surface and groundwater quantity or quality as a critical component of the hydrological cycle groundwater supports a variety of ecosystems called groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes such as wetland fens i e the dominant land cover type in the aosr volik et al 2020 rivers i e groundwater provides 40 of flow to tributaries on the east bank of the lower athabasca river gibson et al 2016 lakes i e groundwater provides 5 20 of input to small headwater lakes schmidt et al 2010 and riparian

2009a the importance of monitoring evaluating and reporting on potential impacts of oil sands development has prompted formation of a provincial federal oil sands monitoring osm program funded by industry and jointly designed implemented and overseen by environment and climate change canada and alberta environment and parks the program is mandated to include integrated reporting and regular assessment of environment condition to inform ongoing policy and management decisions government of alberta 2017 one of the aims of osm was to implement an adaptive management strategy by developing a perspective of baseline conditions based on water quality indicators and establishing a set of decision making triggers and limits that could be acted upon in cases where deleterious changes to the natural system are detected see nie and shultz 2012 the first phase of comprehensive groundwater monitoring in the oil sands region was initiated in 2009 and has proceeded annually amassing a

jasechko 2018 however a regional synthesis of water quality data from aquifers spanning the entire region has yet to be conducted the objective of this study was to compile groundwater quality data available for clbr naos and saos into a combined aosr dataset to interpret the new dataset in the context of conceptual hydrogeological models that describe potential impacts from mining and in situ oil sands activities across the region and to use the new combined aosr groundwater quality dataset to evaluate the efficacy of the current groundwater monitoring program the groundwater quality dataset was compiled and is used for the following purposes i to characterize the geochemical composition of each of the hydrostratigraphic units to better understand the variability of parameters across the aosr ii to compare the range and variability of parameters in the hydrostratigraphic units to interim triggers proposed by gwmf larp and iii to assess whether baseline results identify geochemical anomalies indicating vertical connectivity between aquifers that might require additional monitoring efforts the new regional dataset arising from our analysis is found to have many potential applications for water management in the region as we show it can be used to improve conceptual hydrogeological models for the area and demonstrates approaches to augment traditional groundwater monitoring in data sparse areas through statistical methods and using geochemical data to identify potential aquifer vulnerability 2 study area 2 1 oil sands activities economic bitumen deposits are largely emplaced within the cretaceous mcmurray formation situated at the base of mannville group strata fig 2 depth to the bitumen layer is the main determinant of whether surface mining or in situ methods are used the latter being required at depths below surface of greater than 75 m a range of specific impacts are associated with each type of extraction see s1 supplementary material mining impacts within the naos include dewatering of overburden depressurization of the basal mcmurray aquifer around the mine pits storage of tailings and disturbance to the landscape during development and eventually during reclamation depressurization of the basal mcmurray aquifer is needed for mine stability during excavation and reductions in hydraulic head in the mcmurray and overlying quaternary aquifers fig 2 may result in decreased groundwater contributions to some wetlands tributaries and the main stem of the athabasca river during the operational period these changes in hydraulic head could also alter groundwater flowpaths which could impact groundwater quality by changing the mixing between fresh and saline aquifers numerical groundwater modeling of the hydraulic head response in aquifers adjacent to surface mining over the duration of mine development operation and reclamation predict recovery to pre development levels after pumping for dewatering and depressurization is stopped e g frontier project teck 2011 potential leakage of contaminated process water containing elevated organic contaminants and metals from tailings ponds is another potential threat to groundwater quality water supplies for surface water operations are primarily obtained from the lower athabasca river although some basal mcmurray dewatering sources are also in use in situ extraction methods are typically used in areas where the mcmurray formation is present at greater than 75 m depth including parts of the naos and across the saos and clbr areas fig 2 bitumen is immobile at reservoir temperatures however when heated to 200 c it approaches the viscosity of water enhanced thermal recovery methods e g steam assisted gravity drainage sagd or cyclic steam stimulation css are used to increase the temperature of the bitumen to decrease its viscosity where oil sands are extracted using steam injection groundwater is used for steam production typically 0 4 0 5 m3 of water per m3 of bitumen produced hrudy et al 2010 the majority of this water is withdrawn from permeable cretaceous sandstone formations fig 2 with supplementary quantities taken from relatively deep unconsolidated sand and gravel deposits matrix 2012 heating of aquifer sediment adjacent to the injector wells can result in the release of metals and organics present naturally in the sediment both of which have the potential to affect groundwater quality in the immediate vicinity of operations 2 2 geological and hydrogeological setting the terrain of the aosr region is characterized by low lying plains 550 masl and adjacent broad rolling uplands 700 masl andriashek 2003 fig 1a in this boreal forest ecosystem where 50 of land cover is wetlands and the majority of those wetlands are fens that are sustained by groundwater alberta environment and parks aep 2018 large accumulations of peat and recent soils formed since the final retreat of the continental ice sheets around 10 000 15 000 years ago make up the region s surficial deposits surficial unconsolidated sediments also known as drift are comprised of tills lacustrine clays and fluvial sands and gravels of glacial and pre glacial origin typically ranging from 10 to 30 m thick note that drift deposits can exceed 100 m or more in deeply incised pre glacial and glacial channels eroded into bedrock fig 1a andriashek 2003 the thickness of the quaternary aquifers increases towards the south and in the saos and clbr there are thick sequences of neogene and quaternary sediments the quaternary aquifers in the clbr are well characterized across this region include alternating aquifer and aquitard units intersected by a network of pre glacial and glacial buried channels parks et al 2005 in the clbr the following quaternary hsu s are used for domestic supply grand centre sand river marie creek ethel lake bonnyville muriel lake and empress parks et al 2005 bedrock units are comprised mainly of lower cretaceous formations resting unconformably on upper devonian aged units fig 2 the sedimentary sequence dips to the southwest so the depth to the mcmurray formation becomes progressively deeper towards the southern portion of the study area and the subcropping units differ between the three oil sands sub regions fig 2 thus rivers within incised river valleys of the aosr have the potential for diffuse or localized e g springs interaction with groundwater from formations with different water quality along the river s course shale dominated formations of the colorado group cap the aquifers of the cretaceous mannville group which include in descending order the grand rapids mcmurray and clearwater formations these manville group aquifers are of particular interest since they are used as industrial low quality water sources the dissolution edge of the deeper prairie evaporite formation of middle devonian age forms a prominent structural feature in the aosr broughton 2013 2015 schneider and cotterill 2017 soluble salts e g halite and anhydrite have been removed in that interval which has led to formation collapse a reversal in the usual south west dip on the overlying mannville group formations creating a north easterly dip and formation of a structural trap for hydrocarbons these collapse features provide vertical connectivity between the devonian and the overlying mcmurray formation and are co located with areas of very high tds water in the mcmurray birks et al 2019 cowie et al 2015 the degree of connectivity is influenced by low permeability bitumen deposits in the mcmurray formation which can act as effective aquitards removing this bitumen barrier during operations can increase the potential for saline devonian groundwater to enter the mine pit walker et al 2017 the potential for cross formational groundwater flow also occurs near buried channels fig 1b eroded into and in one area through the underlying bedrock formations as deep as the upper devonian andriashek 2003 in general groundwater flows across the aosr are topographically controlled with more localized shallow groundwater flows originating from regional uplands such as the birch muskeg and stony mountains and flowing to adjacent lowlands incised channels and river valleys bachu 1996 bachu et al 1993 regional flow of deep groundwaters within cretaceous and older strata include deep basin brines originating at depth within the western canada sedimentary basin or glaciogenic brines originating from glacial waters undergoing pressurized recharge under the ice sheet grasby and chen 2005 the latter are commonly encountered in springs or seeps along the athabasca and clearwater rivers see s2 supplementary material 2 3 groundwater monitoring groundwater monitoring of various forms has been a recurring activity for decades in the oil sands region see s3 supplementary material although geochemical parameters and operational details have varied somewhat over time regional provincial groundwater monitoring efforts unrelated to oil sands development has included surveys conducted by the alberta geological survey ags and routine water quality monitoring conducted by the government of alberta s groundwater observation well network gown that was initiated in the 1970s and continued until the mid 1990s there was a monitoring hiatus for the gown that continued until resumption of surveys in 2008 clbr 2009 naos and 2012 saos groundwater quality data are still available for the hiatus due to site specific monitoring of groundwater conditions on and adjacent to active leases that oil sands operators were required to conduct to meet environmental protection and enhancement act epea conditions in the clbr area groundwater is widely used as a source of domestic drinking water so comprehensive groundwater quality data are available from alberta health ah assessments focused on drinking water quality government of alberta 2014 however each of the agencies involved in groundwater monitoring within the oil sands areas aep aer ah have operated according to their respective mandates and jurisdictions and monitoring decisions were generally made to satisfy the specific agencies own objectives 2 4 water quality indicators the types of water quality impacts expected from oil sands activities differs between mining and in situ operations so the gmwf identified different primary secondary and tertiary water quality indicators for each region table 1 primary and secondary indicators are measured on all groundwater samples whereas tertiary indicators are parameters that may be measured as part of investigations to determine the cause of water quality changes the gmwfs did not recommend specific stable or radiogenic isotopes but Œ¥18o Œ¥2h Œ¥13c dic Œ¥34s so4 and Œ¥18o so4 3h and 14c have been measured on selected oil sands monitoring wells to provide information about the sources and ages of water and solutes the gmwf identifies two types of thresholds for detecting changes in water quality triggers which are early warning signs of negative change from the natural variability in aquifer conditions and limits which are conditions beyond which the potential for impacts is considered unacceptable interim regional groundwater quality triggers were developed for each aquifer in the gwmf using oil sands monitoring well and baseline groundwater data to define upper and lower control triggers for the range of natural variability within each aquifer alberta environment and parks aep 2012 in addition to these regional triggers and limits as a part of the gwmf s management system temporal trend analysis on data from individual wells can be used to detect changes in groundwater quality that might occur without exceeding regional triggers or limits the spatial variability of water quality parameters across each aquifer or aquifer management unit makes selection of a single trigger value for each aquifer challenging matrix solutions inc matrix 2014a for this reason final trigger values and selection of the appropriate approach for establishing these limits e g aquifer wide limits vs limits for individual wells or clusters of wells has been postponed pending improved characterization of baseline conditions for each aquifer 3 methods 3 1 data sources this study includes compilation and interpretation of two types of groundwater data oil sands monitoring well mw data these data are from groundwater wells that were selected to be part of aep s oil sands regional groundwater monitoring network to support the osm program and larp gwmf this monitoring network included groundwater wells installed specifically for regional groundwater assessments and oil sands monitoring as well as data from groundwater wells owned by industry who sample and provide the data to aep baseline groundwater data this category of data included all other groundwater quality data from groundwater wells located in each of the regions which were installed and monitored to serve a wide range of applications e g industrial water supply wells domestic groundwater wells industry and government owned monitoring wells installed for non oil sands monitoring programs data from environmental impact assessments eias see s4 supplementary material for this study the term baseline refers to the regional aosr dataset extending from 1958 to 2015 recognizing that some of these data do not represent conditions prior to development the baseline data compiled here were used to evaluate the range of natural variability in hydrostratigraphic units across the region to represent the current state of regional groundwater quality against which future changes can be evaluated and to compare against the data from the oil sands groundwater monitoring wells note that hydrostratigraphic assignments that were adopted to intercompare all three sub regions are provided in s5 supplementary material the oil sands mw data were obtained for each of the three regions from aep and included groundwater wells identified as oil sands monitoring wells in the naos and saos and from a de facto network consisting of gown wells already undergoing monitoring in the clbr the baseline dataset included water quality databases assembled during development of the gwmfs for the three regions alberta environment and parks aep 2013a 2013b 2013c table 2 and were updated with water quality data available from eias see s4 supplementary material for full list and other publicly available datasets e g alberta health these baseline databases included previous provincial monitoring well data and water supply well data submitted as part of industrial and private well reporting however we should note that annual compliance data epea reporting were not available or included 3 2 field methods water quality qa qc and statistical treatment the mw and baseline water quality datasets were from a variety of programs each of which followed standard groundwater sampling protocols and used accredited laboratories but there was undoubtedly some variations in methods used between programs and over time the data were initially screened to remove data without sufficient metadata related to hydrostratigraphic formation or location and were then screened using quality assurance quality control criteria prior to inclusion in the current analysis out of the 27 000 groundwater samples available with water quality data approximately 15 000 met the qa qc criteria and were kept in the database after data cleaning of the geochemical parameters reported in the various databases fifteen of the primary and secondary indicator parameters were selected for statistical analysis na cl so4 tds no3 nh3 doc toc as b si naphthelene pyrene naphthenic acids and temperature statistical treatment of the compiled dataset included use of probabilistic bootstrap technique described in manchuk et al 2021 to model stable values quantify variance and uncertainty and identify temporal anomalies for selected water quality parameters the smoothed bootstrap approach was used to provide an estimate of the stable value of selected water quality parameters that was representative of a specified time interval such values are referred to as stable measured values since the smoothed bootstrap approach filters noise and mitigates outliers for each variable and monitoring well the five most recently available data points were used in the smoothed bootstrap approach to estimate the mean over the resulting window of time and to specify confidence intervals the statistical analysis determined stable values and temporal anomalies for fifteen indicator parameters for each hydrostratigraphic unit that were represented spatially using global ordinary kriging see s6 s8 supplementary material 4 results the combined mw and baseline database included data from the main hydrostratigraphic units used by the oil sands industry fig 3 and covers 1958 2014 fig 4 data from the surficial deposits channel deposits the grand rapids and mcmurray formation are presented here to represent key water supply aquifers for oil sands activities grand rapids and some channel deposits the formation where the majority of oil sands activities are occurring mcmurray formation and the aquifers that could be acting as conduits between the surface and deeper formations channel deposits figs 5 7 4 1 data density the spatial and temporal data density in the compiled dataset of oil sands mw and baseline data highlights differences in groundwater data availability in the main aquifers across the three main oil sands regions fig 3 and variations in monitoring effort that occurred over the programs history fig 4 there is a high density of baseline groundwater quality data available for surficial aquifers in the clbr due to the large numbers of domestic water supply wells in the southwestern portion of the study area fig 3a routine water quality parameters are available from the entire monitoring period but metals and organics were included in the analyzes in the more recent data fig 4 the availability of groundwater quality data from mws coincide with various provincial monitoring initiatives with increased efforts towards groundwater quality monitoring from the 2008 onwards 4 2 geochemical facies the major ion geochemical facies can be used to evaluate the degree of water rock interaction which can be used to infer information about the geochemical evolution and history of the groundwater figs 5 and 6 groundwater typically evolves geochemically along a flowpath from low tds ca hco3 type composition near recharge areas towards na hco3 or so4 dominated types in deeper aquifers with greater water rock interaction time and eventually to deep basin brines where the cl anion often dominates see freeze and cherry 1979 p 241 247 shifts in the dominant cations occur due to ion exchange and precipitation dissolution reactions that are dependent on the mineralogy of aquifer material along the flowpath in shallow aquifers the more soluble minerals have typically been removed from the shallow zone and only mineral phases with lower solubilities remain deeper into the flow system more soluble mineral phases may be present and dissolution of these phases can be influential in determining dominant ions quaternary hydrostratigraphic units showed a wide variety in major ion type classifications fig 5a b for the surficial sand aquifer baseline data show primarily mixed cation bicarbonate waters consistent with recent recharge however there were some wells with na cl baseline wells or so4 type waters baseline and mw which are more typical in deeper flow systems fig 5a the na cl type waters were sampled from wells in the northwestern portion of the surficial sands aquifer west of the athabasca river fig 6a none of the oil sands monitoring wells completed within quaternary units had na cl type compositions even though na cl type waters were identified in the baseline dataset the channel groundwater samples had fewer mixed cations type waters than the surficial sands and were dominated by ca to na consistent with ion exchange fig 5b there were isolated locations with na cl type waters in baseline samples along the gregoire channel in the saos and helina channel in the clbr which may indicate mixing with deeper formation waters where channels are incised into underlying cretaceous formations fig 6b grand rapids formation groundwaters had a ca na hco3 to na cl composition fig 5c this aquifer dips to the southwest and as a result has been eroded away completely in many areas of the naos and is present at increasing depths in the southwest the na cl type waters were found in the saos and clbr where the overlying colorado group aquitard has been removed north of the wiau channel or west of the christina river fig 6c ca mg hco3 type waters tend to occur in the northern extent of the aquifer and also had lower tds concentrations consistent with a shallower flow system fig 7c the wide range of geochemical facies in the mcmurray formation aquifer fig 5d are consistent with previous studies that have hypothesized that vertical connectivity between the mcmurray formation and the underlying saline devonian formations has resulted in widely varying salinity and water type cowie et al 2015 birks et al 2019 the mcmurray formation groundwaters range from ca hco3 type waters more consistent with shallow flow systems in the northern portion of the study region fig 6d to na cl waters sampled in some areas in the naos west of the athabasca river and in the saos in the saos there were isolated samples from the mcmurray formation with hco3 type waters fig 5d in most cases these samples were from groundwater wells located near the thalwegs of buried channels or near river valleys where there may be greater connectivity to shallow flow systems however methanogenesis and or bacterially mediated sulfate reduction can also lead to increased hco3 concentrations and a shift towards this water type 4 3 distribution of stable tds baseline values relative to oil sands mw data the estimated stable measured values that represent the most recently available samples taken from all mw and baseline wells combined are used as a best estimate of the stable values for each water quality parameter based on the combined oil sands groundwater database the modeled distribution of stable tds values provides a useful baseline with outliers and noise removed that can be applied to interpret the current distribution of oil sands mw values kriged stable values for tds shading on fig 7 are shown with control points used for the model indicated by circles and monitoring well data indicated by triangles maps are shown for the surficial sands channel aquifers grand rapids and mcmurray formations but similar maps were developed for each of the hydrostratigraphic units listed in table 2 the shading was only extended to areas with an estimation variance less than 0 9 to highlight areas with sufficient data to infer stable values the distribution of mw and baseline data across the surficial sands aquifer was sufficient to estimate stable values for most of the aquifer only a small portion of this aquifer did not have sufficient data to model stable tds concentrations fig 7a this aquifer had a fairly narrow range of tds concentrations 176 mg l to 3400 mg l compared to deeper units the northwest area of this aquifer contained the highest stable tds values according to the model and was where most of the na cl type waters were detected fig 6a the channel aquifers had a wider range of modeled tds values ranging from 164 mg l in buried channel aquifers in the naos to values approaching 7000 mg l in some deeper buried channel aquifers in the clbr area this aquifer category incorporates a wide range of depths e g drift thickness gregoire 100 m leismer channel 240 m kearl channel 25 70 m helina 50 100 m parks et al 2005 andriashek and atkinson 2007 and the wider range in tds appear to reflect depth of the various channel aquifers as well as tds in adjacent formations highest tds values were measured in groundwater wells in the helina channel fig 7b in contrast low tds in the naos channel aquifers and in the saos leismer channel are consistent with shallower occurrences where greater influence of recently recharged meteoric water would be expected large areas of the grand rapids formation had insufficient baseline data to model stable tds values fig 7c these areas were typically located away from oil sands development the lack of control points and oil sands monitoring well data available at the time of compilation 2015 indicate a need for improved characterization of this important water supply aquifer where data are available a trend of higher tds in the southern portion of this aquifer compared to the northern extent is evident fig 7c the wells with na cl type waters identified in fig 6c occurred in the saos and clbr areas where tds concentrations were higher the modeled stable tds values for the mcmurray formation show some limitations of kriging fig 7d related to the sparse distribution of data away from the central portion of the map the modeled stable tds values capture the higher tds values in the mcmurray formation west of the athabasca river in the naos compared to on the eastern side similar to patterns identified by both cowie et al 2015 and birks et al 2019 however the bootstrapping and variance criteria resulted in omission of some of the high tds groundwater data coinciding with the prairie evaporite dissolution scarp broughton 2013 this highlights one of the challenges in establishing baseline water quality distributions in a region with a high degree of spatial variability due to complex discontinuous geological features in such cases secondary information relating to geochemical sources would need to be included in the kriging equations as a drift term as an additional variable for cokriging or as a locally varying mean for example proximity to the dissolution scarp may be a valid secondary variable if it is found to have sufficient correlation with tds differences between the mw tds shading and the modeled stable values also highlight the challenge of working with water quality data that can be heterogeneous in some aquifers and hydrogeological settings within the region 4 4 spatial anomalies considering typical patterns for geochemical evolution of groundwater from recharge to discharge along flowpaths in sedimentary basins some geochemical indicators of vertical connectivity can be identified in the combined aosr database i e influence of shallow aquifer recharge at depth or indicators of discharge of deep groundwater sources in shallow aquifers in the surficial sands aquifer groundwater with anomalously high concentrations of tds and na cl water type were found near the confluence of the mckay and athabasca rivers in the naos likely indicating deeper more saline groundwater may be discharging at this location several anomalous groundwater compositions were encountered in the vicinity of buried channel aquifers including higher tds and na cl water type that could indicate greater mixing with the adjacent more saline formations in groundwater the gregoire beverly bronson and kikino channels in the grand rapids formation the hco3 type water fig 6 and low tds concentrations near the northern edges of the formation where the colorado group is thin or absent fig 7 suggest mixing with shallower flow the east west divide in tds concentrations and water type for the mcmurray formation aligns with the location of the devonian scarp and are consistent with greater connectivity with saline devonian aquifers near this feature cowie et al 2015 birks et al 2019 4 5 temporal anomalies temporal anomalies for a subset of parameters na cl so4 tds no3 nh3 doc toc as b si naphthelene pyrene naphthenic acids and temperature were evaluated in the combined mw and baseline dataset for each hydrostratigraphic unit and over each of the data rich time periods fig 8 sampling scores and temporal anomalies are shown for the periods before and after 1990 2003 and 2008 in fig 8 the sampling score is a measure of the uniformity of mw and baseline samples for a given indicator relative to the global distribution of the associated indicator and formation sampling scores with values 0 3 indicate a sampling bias either that the parameters is under or over represented for that hydrostratigraphic unit parameters with data from 1 well or with no data are also flagged the direction and significance of temporal anomalies are indicated by the color and thickness outline of each of the boxes in fig 8 the anomaly plots does not indicate any consistent trends in groundwater quality that are present in the entire region over the three time periods which is not surprising based on the discontinuous nature of the hydrostratigraphic units across the region comparison of water quality parameters before and after 1990 indicated primarily decreasing trends but before and after the 2003 and 2008 periods include more increasing or mixed trends comparison of data before and after 2008 indicated the fewest temporal anomalies with about half of them indicating decreases in concentration across the entire dataset sampling scores for naphthalene pyrene and naphthenic acid tended to have the greatest sampling bias likely because these organics are not part of routine water quality analyses and would only have been analyzed for selected wells note that temporal changes in routine field parameters such as ph temperature and redox were not given as much weight in the assessment since methodology used to acquire these data has the potential to influence the results and recognizing that there was little information available on whether consistent historical field and analytical practices were used for some parameters analytical detection limits may have improved over the time period covered by the dataset leading to detectable concentrations for parameters in more recent data that were previously below detection limits however most of the parameters with increasing trends fig 8 were for routine parameters e g tds cl na so4 no3 where significant changes in detection limits are not expected but this will be more thoroughly reviewed in follow up investigations the location of the temporal anomalies relative to hydrogeological features and potential groundwater stressors are also of interest and they were found to occur in distinct clusters in the naos saos and clbr areas fig 9 closer inspection of these clusters shows that all are located in areas where enhanced vertical connectivity due to the presence of buried channels incised rivers or where there is limited to no colorado group cover occur fig 9 the parameter scores within each of the clusters were used to identify the direction of changes in groundwater quality for indicator parameters in each hydrostratigraphic units summary tables in fig 9 parameter score plots for each anomaly are included in s9 supplementary material temporal anomaly 1 occurs in the naos in a group of wells screened in the surficial sands till and mcmurray formations in an area adjacent and east of the athabasca river where surface mining occurs this is an area where the mcmurray and devonian formations have high concentrations of solutes and these formations are directly overlain by quaternary sediments this area is also notable because it coincides with locations where there is evidence of natural saline groundwater seepage discharging to the athabasca river birks et al 2018 gibson et al 2013 gue et al 2015 the temporal anomalies included increasing trends in tds cl and no3 in the till and mcmurray formations as well as decreasing concentrations in so4 in the surficial sands till and mcmurray formations temporal anomaly 2 is in the naos and includes a small group of wells screened in the birch channel clearwater and mcmurray formations located over a buried quaternary channel at this location increases in no3 were observed in all three formations whereas dissolved as concentrations decreased temporal anomaly 3 includes a group of wells in the naos screened in the surficial sands mcmurray and devonian formations adjacent to the athabasca river and near the lewis and clark buried channel and characterized by trends of increasing concentrations of tds na cl and decreasing concentrations of naphthenic acids and so4 this area has previously been identified as a potential investigation area fig 1c for oil sands monitoring worleyparsons 2009b but there are currently no mw located in this area temporal anomalies in the mcmurray formation include increases in cl tds b and naphthenic acids and decreases in so4 temporal anomalies for as in the mcmurray formation are time dependant with increasing trends noted for 1990 and 2003 and decreasing trends after 2008 temporal anomaly 4 is located in the saos over the northern portion of the leismer channel in wells screened in undifferentiated overburden deposits and is the only temporal anomaly not located over an active oil sands lease this portion of the saos is located near the edge of colorado group cover at the margin where the grand rapids formation directly underlies quaternary deposits the changes in groundwater quality at this location include decreases in tds na so4 no3 and as and increases in cl and nh3 temporal anomaly 5 is located in the clbr area and includes a group of wells screened in the grand centre marie creek bonnyville and empress formations centered over the confluence of the helina sinclair and beverly channels in an area of in situ oil sands development fig 9 temporal anomalies were detected in the ethel lake formation a formation that has naturally elevated concentrations of as due to the presence of as bearing minerals moncur et al 2015a the changes in groundwater quality in these locations included increased concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc in all of the formations except the shallowest the grand centre formation 5 discussion analysis of the new compiled aosr dataset has provided better understanding of the range and spatial distribution of water quality parameters in the different hydrostratigraphic units across the region this information can be used to help refine conceptual models of groundwater flow birks et al 2019 to identify areas of aquifer connectivity and vulnerability and to provide insight into the establishment and applicability of water quality limits and triggers detection of spatial geochemical anomalies and areas with temporal changes in groundwater geochemistry may be helpful for identifying areas of greater cross aquifer connectivity to focus future sampling campaigns geochemical indicators of shallow groundwater flow in deep aquifers or the opposite pattern of geochemical indicators of deep groundwater in shallow aquifers may be a useful proxy for hydraulic connectivity between surface and underlying aquifers and can be a key indicator of potential vulnerability conversely where aquifers are poorly connected to surface or adjacent aquifers there may be a reduced likelihood that groundwaters are impacted by surface activities or contamination or that aquifer drawdown will affect groundwater reliant ecosystems 5 1 distribution of water quality parameters relative to hydrogeological controls the maps of stable water quality values e g fig 7 that have been developed from the new mw and baseline datasets provides an archive that can be checked against future values and to help identify potential areas for subsequent monitoring based on identifying areas with high uncertainty in the existing data the distribution of geochemical parameters in the surficial sands aquifer support the hypothesis that shallow aquifers are dominated by topographically driven groundwater flow from uplands to lowlands geochemical anomalies in this formation are interpreted as being the result of differing degrees of flow path interaction between shallow aquifers and the more saline underlying cretaceous formations topographically driven flow is also evident the distribution of tds and water type in the neogene and quaternary aquifers from the clbr area with lower values associated with recharge areas beneath the moostoos uplands and higher values observed progressively along the flow systems e g fig 5b increasing tds along helina channel the general trend of increasing dissolved solids along the flowpath appears to occur consistently as revealed by the baseline data higher tds and cl concentrations were also observed in aquifers in the southwest beaver river flow system in the whitefish uplands in some locations within the channel aquifers the composition of the groundwater is more consistent with deeper formation waters consistent with mixing with adjacent units some of the geochemical anomalies were detected in the baseline dataset that hasn t been as rigorously vetted as the groundwater mw data and so other factors e g well integrity sampling error influencing water quality cannot be excluded however these areas coincide with elevated values of mean stable tds fig 7 and cl we expect that this conclusion is not due to spurious data also several of the observed anomalies in major ion type fig 5 and tds fig 7 are present in approximately the same location within multiple aquifers bonnyville muriel lake and empress formations which strongly suggests that they are related not outliers the compiled oil sands mw and baseline data for some of the deeper cretaceous formations are considerably sparse although available results are consistent with recent geochemical and isotopic data that have recently been made available for the saos birks et al 2019 groundwater in the grand rapids formation increases in tds and shifts towards more na cl waters in the southwest portion of the aquifer where the formation is present at greater depths and overlain by a thicker colorado group cover birks et al 2019 this trend is evident in the compiled mw and baseline data and the new data compiled for this study has shown that this trend extends to the naos where even more dilute ca hco3 rich groundwaters are present consistent with their shallower depth and greater potential for mixing with overlying aquifers lower tds and more hco3 dominant groundwaters are found in the grand rapids formation near the christina river which was an area identified as having greater vertical connectivity based on the presence of glaciogenic isotopic signatures originating from the underlying devonian aquifers birks et al 2019 the importance of geochemical anomalies adjacent to buried channels is also evident e g hco3 dominant groundwaters present within deeper formations and cl dominant groundwaters in shallow formations the distribution of geochemical facies fig 6d and tds fig 7d in the mcmurray formation show the importance of vertical features especially the prairie evaporite dissolution scarp broughton 2013 cowie et al 2015 birks et al 2018 the stable tds values modeled for this formation highlights the challenge in establishing baseline values in areas with very heterogeneous water quality and sparse data vertical preferential flow features such as faults and dissolution scarps can create highly variable water quality distributions that are hard to detect with sparse networks and not suited for many interpolation methods 5 2 comparison with interim triggers the data in the compiled aosr database was used to look at the range of concentrations for the main indicator parameters defined under larp gwmf in each of the hydrostratigraphic units relative to the interim triggers currently in place for each region fig 10 supplemental material s3 there is a fairly narrow range in water quality parameters in most of the quaternary formations in the naos and saos fig 10a but greater ranges observed in the bedrock units fig 10b the clbr region had a very large quaternary water quality dataset due to the large number of wells located in this region and there were many outliers one prevalent trend is that of increasing na and cl concentrations with depth in the stratigraphic sequence from shallower grand centre to deeper empress formations the median values found for some parameters are higher than the interim triggers e g empress formation as tds na and so4 muriel lake as mcmurray formation naphthenic acids devonian naphthenic acids in the clbr naturally occurring as has been measured in groundwater from a number of the surficial deposits e g 180 Œºg l in buried channels moncur et al 2015a median naphthenic acid concentrations for mcmurray and devonian formations in the naos are higher than the interim trigger consistent with other measurements of groundwater from bitumen saturated portions of this formation kilgour et al 2019 the analysis of the new aosr dataset has highlighted the variability in individual aquifers and shown that in some aquifers even the median values are well above the interim triggers fig 10 the presence of highly variable and saline aquifers birks et al 2019 cowie et al 2015 gibson et al 2013 and glacial sediments with the potential to release metals during weathering parameters moncur et al 2015a are potential causes for the naturally high concentrations of some parameters and exceedances detected across the region 5 3 implications for oil sands groundwater monitoring network design there are many approaches for optimizing groundwater monitoring network design including simple random sampling stratified random sampling systematic grid sampling and random sampling within blocks gilbert 1987 alley 1993 however given the large size of the aosr 50 000 km2 and remoteness of some locations it is not economically or logistically feasible to implement high data density collection programs across all aquifers over the entire region so an approach for prioritizing areas based on vulnerability to potential impacts from oil sands activities is needed to help guide monitoring network design the original oil sands monitoring design for the naos and the saos used risk based modeling worleyparsons 2009b matrix solutions inc matrix 2013 to identify vulnerable areas based on proximity to oil sands activities and potential hydrogeological pathways connecting the surface to aquifers used for water sources this approach may not capture all of the potential risks from oil sands activities where some of the potential stressors occur at depth e g groundwater withdrawals and disposal and in complex hydrogeological settings where all of the potential hydrogeological pathways have not been well defined the interpretation of the new combined groundwater quality dataset show how temporal and spatial geochemical anomalies can be used as an additional source of information about potential groundwater vulnerability and connectivity spatial and temporal geochemical anomalies can indicate areas where groundwater conditions are changing or have been subject to interactions with overlying or underlying formations recently or in the past both of which are potential indicators of vulnerability the location of spatial geochemical anomalies section 4 4 and temporal geochemical anomalies section 4 5 were compiled and summarized on fig 11 to identify potential areas requiring additional monitoring areas of potential vulnerability can be identified based on indicators of cross formation mixing and using temporal trends in water quality temporal geochemical anomalies signify a change in the state of groundwater quality that can be from a variety of natural or anthropogenic stressors and can be used to identify areas for further investigation for example the temporal anomalies detected in the mw and baseline dataset could be due to a natural shifts in groundwater flow systems due to changes in recharge or changes in flow systems due to groundwater withdrawals by domestic or industrial users or due to contamination the spatial geochemical anomalies do not necessarily indicate influence of oil sands activities but indicators of vertical connectivity between shallow and deep formations suggest a more dynamic hydrogeological settings that may be more vulnerable to oil sands stressors the current distribution of oil sands monitoring network mws on fig 3 are summarized by hydrostratigraphic unit table 3 with reference to whether spatial or temporal anomalies have been identified to identify potential improvements to the network although the required number of observation wells needed to examine a system will ultimately depend on the objectives of the monitoring program and available budget approaches used in other regional programs include prescribing a minimum number of monitoring sites by aquifer or prescribing a sampling density by aquifer national groundwater water monitoring network ngwmn subcommittee on ground water of the advisory committee on water information 2013 the well density for the oil sands mw ranges from 1 well 311 km2 to 1 well 8694 km2 which can be compared to the us national groundwater monitoring program for principal aquifers where the well density ranges from 1 well 3 km2 to 1 well 82 288 km2 average density across entire program 1 well 5755 km2 subcommittee on ground water of the advisory committee on water information 2013 the grand rapids formation is the most heavily used aquifer for in situ water sourcing and this aquifer has fairly limited monitoring in the aosr with a density of 1 well 6868 km2 the limited number of regional mw that are operating in the saos fig 11 do not include the thousands of on lease monitoring wells that industry are required as part of regulatory compliance monitoring these industry owned wells are another source of monitoring data that could be further utilized for characterizing baseline groundwater quality conditions changes over time the results from numerical groundwater modeling done in eia s to predict the cumulative impacts of oil sands operators withdrawals and injections are another source of information that could be used to identify groundwater vulnerability that have not yet been fully utilized for monitoring design eias require predictions of the potential changes to the groundwater flow systems under full development conditions which are compared to base case scenarios with no development to identify potential environmental impacts to groundwater these predictions of the impacts from groundwater withdrawals e g changes to hydraulic head distributions around groundwater withdrawal and injection wells have not been compared to monitoring data and could be used to help guide monitoring network design examples of other monitoring programs around oil and gas activities e g colorado oil and gas association voluntary baseline groundwater quality sampling program colorado oil and gas association 2011 wheaton and donato 2004 entrix inc 2009 australia pacific lng 2012 australia pacific lng upstream project 2016 give insights into network design approaches that have worked in other resource development areas but they also highlight some of the specific challenges in groundwater monitoring in the aosr such as the large spatial extent remote access the discontinuous distribution of oil sands deposits the variety of resource development approaches surface mining vs in situ conducted by multiple different operators and the natural variability of groundwater quality due to discontinuous features like the prairie evaporite dissolution scarp and buried channels four of the five clusters of temporal anomalies occur in areas where oil sands activities coincide with areas of enhanced vertical connectivity due to buried channels or incised rivers and where adjacent formations have contrasting geochemical compositions fig 11 in most cases the areas with spatial and temporal geochemical anomalies had previously been identified as potential investigation areas and already have oil sands mws there are some interesting groupings in the geochemical parameters with increasing trends across the naos and clbr that are consistent with conceptual models of potential groundwater stressors in these regions decreasing trends in as concentrations were observed in a few of the temporal anomalies 2 3 and 4 and this could indicate a shift in redox conditions at these locations in the naos muskeg drainage and dewatering are needed prior to surface mine development nitrate in groundwater is typically associated with fertilizer use or septic system effluent but can also be released from drainage from peatlands wind mulder et al 1996 munir et al 2017 the increasing trend in no3 across all aquifers in the naos could be consistent with this potential effect of large scale peat drainage in the clbr area increasing trends in doc were identified in multiple wells in this area heating of quaternary sediments from the clbr has been found to result in increased tds and doc concentrations moncur et al 2015b however the increases in no3 and doc identified in the combined mw and baseline dataset could also be due to other natural or anthropogenic sources and more detailed causal investigations including review of the mw data and expanded set of water quality parameters in these areas would be required 6 conclusions given the large size of the aosr and remoteness of some locations it is not feasible to collect groundwater data at high spatial resolutions so methods including spatial and temporal data analyses can improve our ability to assess groundwater quality in these data sparse areas approaches are needed to identify and prioritize groundwater aquifers most vulnerable to impacts from oil sands developments overlaying spatial and temporal anomalies can assist to characterize aquifer connectivity and other approaches such as vulnerability mapping ideally using the results of groundwater modeling can be used to identify potential new oil sands groundwater monitoring locations the interpretation of the combined aosr groundwater geochemistry dataset provides support that conceptual models of vulnerability guiding the initial selection of mw locations appear valid the focus on areas where the colorado group aquitard is absent due to incised rivers or buried channels is considered appropriate the results of comparisons between the new aosr database and the interim triggers in the naos saos and clbr provides strong support for the idea that aquifer based triggers and limits may not be suitable for groundwater monitoring in the aosr especially given the limited amount of available data in some aquifers single number triggers or limits for large and heterogeneous aquifers may not be representative of the entire aquifer and it is recommended that approaches that account for wide range in aquifer quality such as well specific limits of change or limits more closely linked to geological mapping should be explored the newly compiled aosr baseline database has highlighted the value of groundwater quality data originally collected for other purposes to define baseline conditions at a regional scale provided that the associated metadata contain reliable information about completions and hydrostratigraphic units and that data are required to pass the appropriate qa qc screening large volumes of groundwater quality data collected for other regulatory and monitoring purposes e g epea compliance monitoring applications for water use permits domestic water well data are likely to be an extremely valuable data source of baseline and timeseries information one that is complementary to operation of a dedicated set of groundwater monitoring reference wells that are sampled and maintained by the appropriate monitoring agency additional recommendations for enhancing understanding of regional groundwater quality in the aosr include continued groundwater monitoring with expansion coverage in the central area and in regions with high potential for surface water groundwater interaction collection of a consistent set of water quality parameters and recurring database maintenance updates and analysis appropriate statistical techniques such as bootstrapping manchuk et al 2021 can remove anomalous data points and can be extremely valuable for incorporating these large regional datasets into distilled baseline data products this assessment of a regional groundwater dataset from the aosr highlights the challenges of groundwater monitoring in an area with diverse resource development activities associated with establishing baseline water quality distributions in a region with a high degree of spatial variability due to discontinuous geological features as a foundational step of adaptive monitoring this study improved understanding of baseline groundwater quality in the aosr conditions by statistically defining and spatially mapping baseline water quality conditions in the naos saos and clbr sub regions for a subset of the primary and secondary water quality indicators in the larp gwmf such as tds due to data limitations there are still some areas where baseline groundwater quality has yet to be defined e g for some parameters in some aquifers as well as in the peace river region changes in groundwater quality over time were observed in 5 areas 3 in the naos one in the saos and one in the clbr confirmation of groundwater quality changes and investigation of cause are recommended as next steps to ensure that current and future development of oil sands resources do not pose a significant risk to groundwater and the connected groundwater dependent ecosystems further characterization of regional baseline and natural variability of groundwater quantity and groundwater discharge to rivers lakes and wetlands is also needed to serve as a basis for evaluating and attributing change and cumulative effects on the

very high in both absolute and relative terms in a few densely populated countries of south east asia such as bangladesh cambodia and vietnam absolute terms refer to the number of people as well as

and generated damages in infrastructure houses roads bridges etc reaching several tens of billions of euros there are a number of mechanisms influencing flood generation in central europe wy≈ºga et al 2016 explained that heavy precipitation and processes of snowmelt snow cover ice jam soil freezing are factors of relevance for the flood occurrences in poland furthermore intense precipitation in poland has caused urban flash floods in many cities e g pozna≈Ñ gda≈Ñsk and warsaw in the last decades kundzewicz and kowalczak 2014 bryndal et al 2017 climate change has a direct influence on river floods due to the shifts in climatic parameters such as precipitation and temperature consequently the increase of river flood hazard has become relevant due to the increase of the atmosphere water holding capacity field et al 2012 bl√∂schl et al 2019 and seneviratne et al 2021 moreover studies based on observations showed how the climate change has intensified the water cycle resulting in changes of the magnitude frequency and timing of river floods bl√∂schl et al 2017 model based studies aimed at assessment of future climate change impact on floods project a gradual increase in the magnitude and frequency of floods for a large part of the central european region under the rcp8 5 scenario alfieri et al 2015 the usage of the term flood in the present paper follows neither the colloquial understanding of destructive abundance of water nor the meaning accepted in the eu floods directive eu 2007 where the term flood is defined as follows the temporary covering by water of land not normally covered by water in the present paper we follow a stance taken in many scientific papers on flood trend change detection tackling high river discharges either via the notion of annual maximum flow amf or peak over threshold pot discharge there is a caveat though that in the former case the highest flow in a dry year may actually be in the zone of what is normally considered to be a medium discharge in contrast the latter approach deals only with really high discharges higher that a selected threshold in recent years several flood trend detection studies have been carried out at the national mediero et al 2014 petrow and merz 2009 and the european bertola et al 2020 bl√∂schl et al 2017 bl√∂schl et al 2019 kemter et al 2020 mangini et al 2018 levels methodologically such studies frequently use the non parametric mann kendall test mk and sen slope sen 1968 e g mediero et al 2014 mediero et al 2015 bl√∂schl et al 2017 mangini et al 2018 and bl√∂schl et al 2019 the test is applicable for non normal data distribution that is also for flood time series kundzewicz and robson 2004 stahl et al 2010 mediero et al 2014 moreover detection of trends in frequency of floods has been typically assessed using the chi square test frei and sch√§r 2001 vormoor et al 2016 and mangini et al 2018 at the national scale mediero et al 2014 analyzed the trends in magnitude frequency and timing of floods in spain finding a decreasing trend in annual maximum flow amf while the results for the peak over threshold pot showed a general decrease of magnitude and frequency petrow and merz 2009 detected positive trends in flood magnitude and frequency for a considerable number of studied basins in winter especially in the western and the eastern region of germany while mixed changes were found for the summer season in the south and the east parts of the country in a similar national study for poland piniewski et al 2018 found a general decreasing trend for the annual maximum flow with only 21 of gauges with an upward tendency over the country while grygoruk et al 2021 identified no trends in floods in the lower basin of the biebrza valley in north east of poland at the european level bl√∂schl et al 2017 2019 detected patterns in the magnitude and timing of floods with an earlier flood occurrence in the north east of europe and a flood magnitude decreasing in the eastern part due to an earlier snowmelt produced by a temperature rise they also mentioned that the flood discharge would decline in the southern poland from 0 1 m3 s 1 km 2 to approximately 0 075 m3 s 1 km 2 if a continuous decrease of discharge is present for the next years mangini et al 2018 searched for trends in magnitude and frequency of floods using both the annual maximum flow and peak over threshold methods reporting the highest positive trend in pot magnitude occurring in central europe also bertola et al 2020 who studied the difference in changes in small and large floods over the european region found an upward tendency in the northwestern europe similar to results of bl√∂schl et al 2017 2019 mangini et al 2018 mentioned that trend with both approaches is not always consistent which suggests that both methods should be used to capture uncertainty in flood trend detection moreover global scale and pan european studies e g villarini et al 2011b mangini et al 2018 do et al 2020 wasko et al 2020 on annual maximum daily discharge and flood trends have partially or completely left poland out of the analyses due to the lack of free access to polish data that persisted until recently meanwhile studies that included poland in their analysis e g bl√∂schl et al 2017 bl√∂schl et al 2019 bertola et al 2020 usually included the pre 2010 data floods can be characterized in quantitative terms in a number of different ways e g by magnitude frequency and timing indicators which belong together with duration and rate of change to the set of five components of flow regime which regulate the ecological processes in river systems duan and cai 2018 poff et al 1997 richter et al 1996 poff et al 1997 zhang and wei 2014 and duan and cai 2018 used these indicators to characterize high river discharges including floods in addition studies have shown the importance of these indicators for an overall and accurate description that allows a better understanding of flood processes and characteristics burn and whitfield 2017 mostofi zadeh et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 in this study detection of trends in a comprehensive set of indicators of floods in poland is carried out to fill in the knowledge gaps identified above the trend analysis focuses on observed daily discharge data processed using amf and pot methods the analyses are carried out for two different periods 1956 2019 and 1981 2019 characterized by different spatial coverage of flow gauge data 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area this study was carried out for a large set of catchments distributed across poland fig 1 located mainly in drainage basins of two large rivers the vistula and the odra vob region for the sake of synthetizing results we used the generalized boundaries of river basin districts aligned with those assumed in the eu floods directive reports provided by the polish water authorities to the european commission since some of these so called water regions were very small we merged them with their larger neighbors in result 12 water regions hereafter called river basins were distinguished fig 1 the median area of these river basins is equal to 26 761 km2 the climate of poland is characterized by the influence of air masses from the atlantic ocean and the eurasian land the country is located in a transitional warm temperate climatic zone b≈Çazejczyk 2006 the annual average temperature 7 9 c kundzewicz and matczak 2012 is increasing with the global warming spatially it ranges from 6 c in the northeast to 10 c in the southwest and in the highest mountain it is below 0 c in addition the annual total precipitation for the northern and central belt is approximately 500 700 mm year while in the southern and the mountain region the total precipitation attain values around 780 and 1100 mm respectively b≈Çazejczyk 2006 two dominant land use and land cover classes are agriculture and forests that occupy 63 and 32 of polish territory respectively there is no strong spatial gradient in land use but agricultural areas prevail mainly in the central part of the country southern higher elevated part of poland features more impermeable soils soil cover in the rest of the country that was shaped by numerous glaciations is highly variable in space soil permeability ranges from very low e g in the vistula river delta to high different clusters located mainly in central poland 2 2 river flow data the data analyzed in this study were extracted from the institute of meteorology and water management national research institute imgw pib holdings the selection took into account the balance between the number of gauges in particular regions and the available length of the time series as described in piniewski et al 2018 who used 147 flow gauges in poland the selected gauges are also free of important human influences on the flow regime such as presence of large dams located upstream since flow gauges differed with respect to the start date of hydrologic measurements it was decided to conduct the analyses separately for two scenarios the subset a consisting of 58 gauges with data available from 1956 to 2019 thus maximizing the temporal coverage and the subset b including all 146 gauges thus maximizing spatial coverage with data from 1981 to 2019 fig 1 the choice followed the database initially assembled by piniewski et al 2018 and updated here by adding data from three recent years 2017 2019 the median of catchment areas is equal to 551 km2 with a minimum and maximum catchment area of 6 and 6931 km2 respectively for the whole dataset 2 3 indices of floods the indices to determine the changes in indicators of floods are compiled in table 1 the annual maximum river flow denoted as q max is the maximum of the discharge recorded in a hydrological year in poland it is assumed as 1 november 30 october while the concept of peak over threshold pot is based on the peaks above a defined threshold level cunnane 1973 madsen et al 1997 mangini et al 2018 the q max series were extracted from the daily discharge data set as the maximum value in a hydrological year for each of the gauges for determination of the half year indicators denoted as q maxtwi and q maxtsu for winter and summer respectively maximum flow values per half year were extracted from the data set the pot approach detects all high flows exceeding a specific threshold not just one high flow event per year such as in annual maximum flow davison and smith 1990 villarini et al 2011a that is the number of episodes in one year can be different from one being zero or an integer number 1 2 3 hence the magnitude and the frequency of high flows above a threshold can be determined in this case pot series were identified from a predefined quantile 92 5th 95th or 97 5th percentile as a threshold the percentiles were selected as a threshold depending on the variable study conditions villarini et al 2011a ward et al 2018 kumar et al 2020 gupta and dhanya 2020 in order to obtain an appropriate number of events during the year at least 30 and not more than 3 n for the whole pot time series where n is the length of time series the great majority of gauges 123 of the whole dataset were assigned to the 97 5th threshold however for some gauges located mainly in the northern part of poland but not very close to the coast this threshold had to be reduced in order to grasp a higher number of pot events in our study a dependence criterion of 30 day was arbitrarily selected to define independent peaks between two consecutive events mallakpour and villarini 2015 for describing the changes in magnitude of floods the analyses were processed with both pot magnitude and q max magnitude denoted as potm and q maxm respectively while for flood frequency they were focused on pot approach and the frequency of exceedance was denoted as potf the changes in flood timing were assessed based on q max approach separately for annual and sub annual periods summer and winter half years i e november april and may october respectively to detect the day of occurrence of the events the trends of q max timing is presented with an annual and a seasonal approach summer and winter half year by the application of mean day of high flow mdf where the dates of flood timing were converted into an angular value macdonald et al 2010 mediero et al 2014 bl√∂schl et al 2017 do et al 2020 wasko et al 2020 as per the following equations 1 ij df ij 2 œÄ j d 2 j t a n 1 y x when x 0 y 0 j t a n 1 y x œÄ when x 0 j t a n 1 y x 2 œÄ when x 0 y 0 3 x 1 p i 1 e cos ij 4 y 1 p i 1 e sin ij 5 mdf j j j d 2 œÄ where df ij is the date of occurrence of a maximum flow in a hydrological year j represents the direction of the angle x and »≥ are the cosine and sine components of the mean date of a maximum flow j d shows the average number of days per year 365 25 used and p is the number of peaks in the time series the reader is referred to literature such as bl√∂schl et al 2017 and mediero et al 2014 for more details on mdf calculation 2 4 trend analyses following studies on river flood indicators bl√∂schl et al 2017 2019 mangini et al 2018 mediero et al 2014 we used the non parametric mann kendall test mk and sen slope sen 1968 in the trend detection process for potm q maxm and for flood timing based on q maxtan q maxtwi and q maxtsu sen method sen 1968 was applied to estimate magnitude of trends due to its greater robustness to outliers than the parametric analysis piniewski et al 2018 in this process the median slope of every possible ordered pair of the time series is calculated additionally the trends detected were evaluated for significance using the mk test with p values at a significance level of 10 0 1 in consistence with other recent flood trend studies such as vormoor et al 2016 bl√∂schl et al 2017 bl√∂schl et al 2019 tramblay et al 2019 and do et al 2020 kundzewicz and robson 2004 as well as mediero et al 2014 explained that the mk test is applicable for flood time series especially because hydrological data usually have a non normal distribution for more details on trend calculation the reader is referred to mediero et al 2014 and mangini et al 2018 in this study the mann kendall test is based on eqs 7 8 7 s i 1 n 1 j 1 1 n sgn x j x i 8 sgn x j x i 1 if x j x i 0 0 if x j x i 0 1 if x j x i 0 where x j and x i are the values sorted by data sequence and n is the length of the data set frei and sch√§r 2001 vormoor et al 2016 and mangini et al 2018 detected that the chi square test on parametric poisson regression is a feasible alternative for trends in potf because it is able to fit the series of count assuming that such count has a poisson distribution that varies linearly over time mangini et al 2018 this analysis was carried out in r kendall and zyp packages by the implementation of a code developed by mangini et al 2018 trend results of potm and q maxm were converted into a percent change per decade gudmundsson et al 2019 stahl et al 2012 which eases interpretation and comparability of results the percent change per decade sm is defined by eq 9 9 s m s c x 10 years x x 100 where sm is the trend in percentage change per decade s c is the sen slope and x is the average of the annual flood time series then changes in potf and q maxt with an annual and a seasonal approach are presented in events per decade by eq 10 10 sf sc x 10 years where sf is the trend in events per decade and s c is the sen slope by chi square test on parametric poisson regression in the case of frequency 3 results 3 1 trends in q max and pot magnitude the analyses of the q maxm showed a strong and consistent pattern a general downward trend for both subsets and both approaches was observed with statistically significant decreases of more than 15 per decade at some gauges the time series of q maxm manifests stronger changes fig 2 a b than potm fig 2 c d for instance in the north east region lower vistula pregolya narew q maxm has the highest downward tendency in both subsets in comparison to potm fig 2 c d changes are less pronounced for the subset a with smaller number of gauges but longer time series of records than for the subset b this holds for pot and q max method where a positive tendency is found in the south east region particularly in the upper vistula basin where the percentage increase for q maxm is around 5 15 fig 2b but with no statistical significance for potm the variation of change is between 0 and 5 per decade in the south east region fig 2 d the trend results for all river basins are summarized in table 2 where the percentage of gauges exhibiting significant positive or negative trends is shown for the two subsets a general downward trend is observed for almost all the river basins for both subsets at the national level for q maxm there is a temporal stability in detected trends with roughly 75 of gauges with decreasing trends irrespective of the starting year for potm the evidence for decreasing trends is stronger for subset a 76 of gauges and 28 with significance than b 64 and 11 with significance for q maxm nine river basins all but the upper vistula east and west as well as the bug exhibit downward trends in at least 73 of gauges for both subsets it is interesting that although downward trend magnitude is lower for the subset a statistical significance is much more frequent 53 of gauges than for the subset b 17 the largest difference between two approaches can be found for the middle vistula basin in subset b for which 47 of gauges show insignificant decreasing trend in potm and 73 in q maxm 3 2 trends in pot frequency the frequency of flood events is determined on the basis of pot series fig 3 illustrates the spatial changes of flood events per decade with higher variability for the long time series this result is similar to findings for q maxm and potm presented in fig 2 the pattern of potf has a negative trend for the northern part of the country for each period while in the southern regions various trend directions were found but upward trends prevail some gauges in the eastern regions are characterized by a positive tendency in both periods the narew the bug and the upper vistula west and east have the higher values for the period 1981 2019 detected trends in flood frequency have low magnitude and in great majority they are insignificant in both periods subsets a and b none of the gauges from subset a has an upward trend higher than 0 2 events per decade and only two one gauge in the northeast region with significant change out of 146 gauges from the subset b have such trend indeed the main similarity between the two subsets is the increasing trend in the southern part of poland mostly in vicinity of the slovakian border and the decreasing tendency in the north east region one difference is detected in the eastern part bug region with a downward pattern in the subset a and an upward in the subset b table 3 supports the findings from fig 3 where a common decreasing trend is found at the national level potf has a decreasing trend in 71 7 with significance and 66 3 with significance of gauges for the subsets a and b respectively which shows that the temporal stability is in place in some river basins there is no clear pattern for example in the upper vistula west half of gauges point at upward downward trend in pot frequency irrespective of the time period another extreme case is the noteƒá basin for which upward trends occur in all two gauges from subset a whereas all eight gauges exhibit downward trends in subset b just one with statistically significant change an insignificant upward tendency for 67 six out of nine of gauges was found in the bug basin for the subset b however the subset a displayed an insignificant increase of 14 one gauge for the same area in addition an insignificant downward trend in 100 of gauges for the subset a in the pregolya and upper odra was detected similar to the period of 1981 2019 with 100 and 75 for pregolya and upper odra basin respectively the potf at the national scale presents an increase for the subset b of 34 of gauges with a positive trend in summary based on potf results we have detected a moderate but mostly insignificant downward change in flood frequency mainly in the northern part of poland for the subset b the notec the warta the pregolya and the lower vistula basins where the decrease is consistent and described by values not exceeding 0 2 flood events per decade 3 3 trends in q max timing before results on trends in q max timing are presented the average timing of river floods in the observation record is shown in fig 4 the spatial pattern in the subsets a and b for the q maxtan fig 4 a b shows that average flood timing varies between february and april for most of the country lowland part whereas in mountainous south the average flood timing is from may till july due to different flood generation mechanisms in different parts of poland a mixture of snowmelt heavy rainfall in summer and winter precipitation the average timing of annual floods reflects both years with spring or winter floods predominant in the centre and north and summer floods prevailing in the south a different trend pattern can arise once the flood timing is analyzed separately for winter and summer half years for which flood generation mechanisms are more consistent the q maxtsu for both subsets fig 4 c d exhibit an interesting spatial pattern with the earliest occurrence of summer half year flood peaks in north eastern and central part of poland typically june gauges located close to the coast and in the upland part in the south are characterized by flood peaks occurring in july june july is the average flood timing period in summer half year for the southern most gauges in the carpathian and the sudety mountains a more spatially uniform pattern occurs in winter half year flood peak timing fig 4 e f in this case the pattern resembles to much extent that for the annual timing except for gauges in southern mountainous area the earliest occurrence of winter floods february occurs in the coastal parts of the country and the latest in the north east the results of changes for the time occurrences of flood series are presented in fig 5 the changes are expressed as number of days per decade which allows to detect an earlier or later incidence of flood peaks spatial pattern of trends shown in fig 5 a b is more complex than respective patterns in flood magnitude and frequency across poland and there is a lower statistical significance in comparison to q maxm the patterns for two subsets a and b are not fully consistent and also the magnitude of trends is higher for the second subset in general decreasing trends prevail especially in the southern part of the country both mountains and upland regions in the north east the pattern is highly mixed with neighboring gauges showing changes of large magnitude and opposing directions in the north western part of poland there is a dominant increasing trend with significant changes for one gauge in the subset b though a different pattern with more robust results for the larger subset restricted to the period 1981 2019 than for the smaller subset restricted to 1956 2019 can be found for trends in q maxtsu fig 5c d in this case a tendency for earlier flood occurrence dominates throughout the whole country especially for subset b the largest magnitude of this decrease exceeding 8 days per decade can be observed for gauges located in the upland part in the south and in the proximity of the coast in the north for subset a increasing statistically significant trends can be found mostly for the eastern part for q maxtwi fig 5 e f the country is roughly divided into two halves with increasing trends dominating in the north except for the northern part of the lower vistula basin and decreasing in the south except for the southern part of the upper vistula west basin which generally resembles trends for the annual flood timing the pattern is generally consistent across two subsets with lower magnitude of trends detected for the longer period statistical significance occurs only in several gauges located mainly in the northeast subset b in summary the trends in q max timing for annual and sub annual data with the percentage and number of gauges with statistical significance are presented in tables 4 and 5 respectively when looking at particular basins in some cases we can observe high sensitivity to the time period selected for analysis for example in the upper odra and the upper vistula west basins significantly higher fraction of gauges was pointing at insignificant decreasing trends for subset a than b this may be related to the acceleration of warming and in consequence snowmelt in the second part of the analyzed period on the other hand for summer and winter flood timing the trends were more consistent between the two time periods table 5 the summer half year illustrated a strong decreasing trend in almost all the regions of poland for both subsets with 10 of gauges showing statistical significance for 1956 2019 7 for 1981 2019 an upward tendency was detected for the winter half year timing in the northern regions where in the lower odra and narew basins there were later occurrences in 75 and 68 of gauges for subset b while in the lower vistula basin increasing trend was detected in 80 of gauges for subset a nevertheless for only 5 of all streamflow gauges the change for q maxtwin was statistically significant 4 discussion the trend detection of various flood indicators is important for understanding of the observed changes in flood pattern in poland the use of two complimentary methods pot and q max series allows for a more comprehensive examination of the magnitude frequency and timing of high flow episodes this topic has been rarely studied in poland while pan european and global scale studies dealing with changes in flood hazard have typically left the country out of analysis due to the lack of free access to flow data to our knowledge there is no study that used comparably recent data for trend detection in flood indices in this region with an exception of piniewski et al 2018 who nevertheless studied only one flood indicator q maxm 4 1 trends in flood magnitude the trend detection in flood magnitude via q maxm showed a visible spatial variability and statistical significance in both periods including 58 of all the gauges in subset a and 18 in subset b the decreases were detected mainly in the northern river basins while the increases were present in the south of the country the highest downward change in percent per decade in all the cases was detected in the northeast with values about 15 per decade the statistical significance was also most frequent in this region for example in the narew basin changes at 87 5 of all gauges for the period 1956 2019 were significant for q maxm this overall result is in agreement with that reported by piniewski et al 2018 who found the strongest decreasing trend in the northern part of poland and a moderate increase in the southern most mountainous part close to the border with slovakia direct comparison of our results with those from other authors of publications on changes in flood hazard is a challenge due to different study emphases and coverage area nevertheless our results show a generally coherent pattern with previous european studies of bl√∂schl et al 2019 bertola et al 2020 and slater et al 2021 bl√∂schl et al 2019 who studied trends in flood magnitude in europe based on european flood database by hall et al 2015 for 1960 2010 using the time series of annual maxima of daily mean or instantaneous discharge data found a rather complex pattern in mean annual flood change over poland while the majority of the territory including the entire eastern and interior parts exhibited downward trend below 5 per decade upward trends were also noted in two regions the northern edge close to the baltic sea coast weak trend and a smaller south eastern edge with a slightly stronger magnitude of trend the spatial pattern revealed by our analyses matches the one discovered by bl√∂schl et al 2019 quite well although we have not found a weak increasing trend in the coastal region a different pattern of trends in the northern regions of poland was found by bertola et al 2020 who analyzed trends in 100 year and 2 year floods in europe for small and large catchments based on the same european flood database of hall et al 2015 as bl√∂schl et al 2019 they found that northern poland features a decrease in flood magnitude for both recurrence levels and catchment size classes as supported by our findings in contrast kundzewicz et al 2018 studied the spatial temporal change of numbers of large floods in the whole of europe based on flood data from the dartmouth flood observatory dataset where large floods were defined as those with severity and magnitude greater than a selected threshold they detected larger floods between 1985 and 2016 in the southern part of poland as our main results for q maxm where heavy and prolonged precipitation 2 5 days are the most common flood generators in the area kundzewicz et al 2014b and ruiz villanueva et al 2016 our findings are also consistent with slater et al 2021 who analyzed global changes in river floods with different probabilities of occurrence using annual maximum daily streamflow they found decreases in 20 and 50 year floods for central europe a region containing poland and this is consistent with our q maxm results the 20 and 50 year floods exhibited a clear downward pattern in most of the country except for a few gauges located in mountainous south a similar pattern as in our study in some river basins we identified a lack of robustness between the analysis performed for two subsets a and b characterized by different spatial and temporal coverage for example in the upper vistula west basin a decreasing trend in potm was found for the longer period 1956 2019 while an upward trend for the shorter time period 1981 2019 table 2 a similar pattern was observed by vormoor et al 2016 who studied trends for daily peak flow series in norway and found a higher number of stations with decrease in the longer time period than in the shorter period in addition mostofi zadeh et al 2020 mentioned that a predominantly increasing trend in a short period recent years could indicate a possible common driver of floods in a specific area this is consistent with our findings for the subset b for 1981 2019 overall the spatial patterns of change are different depending on the scale observed data and method applied for example masseroni et al 2021 who used daily streamflow data for 1950 2013 showed a general positive trend in annual streamflow volumes in the continental region of europe but with an opposite pattern for the majority of stations in slovakia close to the polish border this is a different pattern from the majority of reported literature and our study however it should be noted that their main focus was on annual discharge volumes and not on river floods as in our case drivers of changes in flood magnitude are still debated due to the lack of hydrometric gauges and large scale evidence bl√∂schl et al 2019 but one common result was determined in the northeastern europe where studies such as estilow et al 2015 bl√∂schl et al 2017 2019 and bertola et al 2020 mentioned an association between this downward trend and the increasing air temperature and earlier snowmelt this drop in flood magnitude closely follows larger decreases in mean snow cover depth in eastern poland szwed et al 2017 which have an impact on snow storage with low magnitude values negative changes per decade in both methods such as the downward trend flood in europe that madsen et al 2014 found for snowmelt dominated areas the downward trends in the north are related to a decrease in river discharge which is the dominant factor in this region kundzewicz et al 2018 indeed this decreasing trend over north western regions may also be associated with a negative phase of azores scandinavia oscillation aso index defined as the sea level pressure difference between the oscillations of gibraltar the azores and haparandain sweden and gibraltar and vestervig in denmark generating a dry climate over north and central western europe willems 2013 the increases prevailing in the southern part are associated with heavy and prolonged precipitation 2 5 days especially in the mountain areas kundzewicz et al 2014b and ruiz villanueva et al 2016 in fact both patterns decreases in the north and small increases in the south are corroborated by the results of piniewski et al 2018 who also studied q maxm indicator for the time period reaching 2016 4 2 trends in flood frequency analysis of changes in pot frequency did not demonstrate an evident and significant trend due to the low values of changes in events per decade detected even though the spatial distribution showed a particular decrease in northern part of poland and a mixed behavior in the south statistical significance of flood frequency was the lowest among all flood indices studied in the paper table 3 displayed a robust result of decreasing trend for potf in the pregolya basin in both subsets while a weaker robustness for the warta and the bug basins therefore it should be noted that the increase of flood frequency in the country is less common and it refers mainly to the southern area there are very few studies dealing with trends in flood frequency that we could use as a reference for comparison with our results for example mudelsee et al 2003 analyzed the occurrence rate of summer and winter extreme floods in the elbe and odra rivers and found a downward trend in winter floods for the past 50 80 and 100 years where the decreasing pattern was attributed to less severe freezing events during the study period they also showed a downward trend in frequency of extreme floods for the central europe area but with some increase during the past decades that could be explained by nonhomogeneous historical data records mangini et al 2018 analyzed the pot frequency for different regions in europe using mean daily streamflow data and found consistent negative trends in potf in the continental part of europe where many stations had results with change in the range from 0 2 0 events per decade similarly to our findings unfortunately the study did not include analyses with gauges over poland that could be compared directly with our results in contrast the global scale study of berghuijs et al 2017 reported increases in magnitude and occurrences of extreme corresponding to 1 30 annual exceedance probability floods in europe but the results were not presented at a finer than continental spatial scale and flow data from poland were not used in the analysis similar decreasing results in flood frequency was found by tramblay et al 2019 who used daily discharge data and associated the less frequent occurrence of floods above 95th and 99th flow percentile in the mediterranean region to the soil moisture decrease this decrease may compensate the increasing rainfall amount even more in areas with observed crop yields and a lack of urban areas tramblay et al 2019 the general downward trend found in our paper could be directly associated with the anomalies in the soil moisture around poland as detected by piniewski et al 2020 and pi≈Ñskwar et al 2020 also in their study on flood regime changes in europe hall et al 2014 reported a marked decrease in the number of observed flood events in the east of central europe with a variation of floods over poland strupczewski et al 2001 found a decreasing number of flood events between the decades of 1920 and 1990 while kundzewicz et al 2012 mentioned an increase of the number of regional flood occurrences during 1946 2010 in addition it is difficult to have direct comparison due to a lack of trend detection studies in flood frequency in poland and the results are still debated due to the lack of large scale evidence moreover the frequency as well as magnitude of floods could vary due to different factors such as deforestation river regulations climate variations and land use change for a specific area which would have a direct effect on the occurrence of flood events kundzewicz and schellnhuber 2004 in fact a recent finding of seneviratne et al 2021 at the sixth assessment report of climate change 2021 showed that the changes in frequency and magnitude of fluvial floods are more complex while pluvial floods are on the rise with increasing intense precipitation 4 3 trends in flood timing the river basins in northern and central poland showed a concentrated annual flood timing in february april while may june was the period of average flood timing in the southern most basins this is in agreement with studies of flood timing in europe based on observed data bl√∂schl et al 2017 hall and bl√∂schl 2018 wasko et al 2020 who studied trends in flood timing based on daily streamflow data at global scale showed an average flood timing in february march for the eastern part of germany and a limited part of western poland not fully included in the study which coincides with our results as well the flood timing between march may could be linked with the north atlantic oscillation nao and the snowmelt processes determining the runoff generation in spring march may due to the increasing winter temperature and changing precipitation pattern kaczmarek 2003 moreover nao characterized by a quasi cyclical change of atmospheric pressure in the icelandic low and the azores high influences the winter conditions over a large part of europe kaczmarek 2003 and kundzewicz et al 2019 detected trends in annual flood timing exhibited considerable spatial variability only 10 11 of gauges showed statistical significance which is less than for flood magnitude and more than for flood frequency the detected pattern of trends in annual q max timing partly agrees with the one identified by bl√∂schl et al 2017 who studied flood timing in europe using the european flood database of hall et al 2015 they detected two large clusters of increasing trends over north western and south eastern poland the north western part of poland specifically the lower odra basin and the northern part of the notec basin coincide completely with the increasing trend later occurrences for the subset b and partially for the subset a however in our study the south eastern region was characterized mostly by trends in the opposite direction especially for the subset of gauges with higher data availability 1981 2019 the end year of gauge data in the study of bl√∂schl et al 2017 was 2010 which may partly explain the different behavior given that the decade of 2010 s was extremely warm in this region of europe bl√∂schl et al 2017 also identified a strong trend of earlier flood timing in lithuania neighboring poland in the northeast in our case the results are slightly different because in the north eastern poland e g the narew and pregolya basins the pattern is mixed but increasing trends slightly dominate advances in timing of floods were found in the southern basins and the lower vistula basin for the annual data and for winter half years where the increased river runoff in winter is associated with a positive nao phase in this particular area of poland and over the north and north east europe wrzesi≈Ñski 2008 wrzesi≈Ñski and paluszkiewicz 2011 and kundzewicz et al 2019 also wrzesi≈Ñski and paluszkiewicz 2011 mentioned that after occurrence of a positive nao phase in a warmer winter with less snow meltwater floods are visibly lower this trend is also associated with the general behavior of north eastern parts of europe with warming and spring incidence of snowmelt bl√∂schl et al 2017 bl√∂schl et al 2019 in addition the floods in the lower vistula basin and the southern region of poland have been associated with cyclones which can move from the mediterranean region to central eastern europe that generates high precipitation amounts in the area van bebber 1891 wy≈ºga et al 2016 in fact volosciuk et al 2016 and tabari and willems 2018 mentioned that factors from the mediterranean sea such as atmospheric moisture and evaporation can be associated to flood events in central europe caused by intense precipitation in summer a global study of do et al 2020 investigating trends in the ordinal year of annual maximum streamflow showed that prediction of flood timing in central european region including poland is associated with low confidence which may partly explain the complex pattern of trends in this indicator in our study interestingly they also showed that three out of five global hydroclimate zones intersect poland which confirms the complexity of flood generation mechanisms and resulting flood timing patterns across the country 5 concluding remarks this study analyzed trends in magnitude frequency and timing of river floods over two periods 1956 2019 and 1981 2019 in poland the indices described annual maximum discharge and peak over threshold flow series the use of both methods allowed for a better understanding of changes in river flood indicators comparison of two different subsets of flow gauges demonstrates stronger trends for the more abundant subset with shorter time series 1981 2019 than for the less abundant subset with longer time series 1956 2019 trends in magnitude of floods calculated for pot and q max series illustrate a visible spatial variability over the river basins of the country with an evident statistical significance especially for the longer of two considered periods 1956 2019 a relatively strong downward pattern was found in the northeastern part of poland for both subsets analyzed while an increasing trend was obtained usually in the southern part of the country evidence for changes in frequency of river floods in poland was weak in contrast a strong pattern of advanced river flood timing was found over southern poland and an opposite trend in northeastern and northwestern poland all these changes that were detected for recent years may not necessarily continue in the future due to climate change and other factors this leaves an opportunity to study the attribution of changes in river floods as well as their future projections as a next step in addition the influence of climate variation on trend detection should be considered tabari and willems 2018 and tabari et al 2020 stated that climate fluctuations occur on different times and scales over a region e g in the rhythm of multi decadal oscillations which may impact the precipitation patterns that can turn into flood events in this case precipitation variability over europe is influenced mainly by ocean atmosphere circulation especially the north atlantic oscillation nao therefore the complexity of interaction between oceans and atmosphere makes it difficult to detect the principal driving forces of the oscillations and their influence on the variation of floods over the region willems 2013 finally the observed changes in magnitude frequency and timing of floods obtained in our research provide one of the first analyses of this under studied topic in poland we show that the patterns are complex and not always consistent with previous research which means that further studies are required it is especially important to enrich the knowledge

7982,study region poland representative sample of 146 flow gauges free of major human modifications located in 12 major river basins study focus the objective was to present trends in selected river flood indicators magnitude frequency and timing in poland using the annual maximum daily flow and peak overthreshold approaches two periods 1956 2019 and 1981 2019 were analyzed the first period maximized the temporal coverage and featured 58 gauges while the second period maximized spatial coverage and featured 146 gauges trends were computed using the non parametric mann kendall test mk and sen slope for changes in magnitude and timing while flood frequency trend was detected by chisquare test on parametric poisson regression new hydrological insights for the region we found a general decreasing trend in flood magnitude with frequently occurring statistical significance for the majority of river basins particularly in north eastern poland the strongest of these trends exceeded 15 per decade a positive trend was detected in the southern part particularly in the upper vistula basin no substantial and significant trends were detected in flood frequency where identified changes mostly did not exceed values of 0 2 events per decade trend in flood timing showed a strong pattern of earlier flood occurrences in the southern half of the country for both periods and an opposite behaviour in the north eastern and northwestern regions graphical abstract ga1 keywords trend detection flood peak over threshold annual maximum flow poland 1 introduction flood is a catastrophic natural hazard that leads to human and economic losses each year in many countries floods account for 43 of the number of global disasters between 1994 and 2013 affecting approximately 2 5 billion people and causing 0 16 million deaths cred 2015 hu et al 2018 in the last decade large river floods occurred in many countries at all continents except the antarctic the floods in 2010 in china set a damage record close to us 70 billion in inflation adjusted currency for 2015 kundzewicz et al 2019 in addition kundzewicz et al 2014a demonstrated that the exposure of people and material assets is very high in both absolute and relative terms in a few densely populated countries of south east asia such as bangladesh cambodia and vietnam absolute terms refer to the number of people as well as the value of assets and gdp gross domestic product exposed to floods while relative terms refer to share of population and percentage of economy exposed to floods jonkman 2005 demonstrated that floods have a major impact on people ecosystems and historical cultural aspects the central european region is not free of major flood risk kundzewicz et al 2005 mentioned major river floods in the region on the odra in 1997 on the vistula in 2001 and on the elbe in 2002 also recent events such as floods in germany in 2013 bl√∂schl et al 2013 schr√∂ter et al 2015 and in particular floods in germany and belgium in july of 2021 kreienkamp et al 2021 caused huge losses in the region the latter deluge killed over 210 people that is far more than any other flood in the european union eu in last 50 years and generated damages in infrastructure houses roads bridges etc reaching several tens of billions of euros there are a number of mechanisms influencing flood generation in central europe wy≈ºga et al 2016 explained that heavy precipitation and processes of snowmelt snow cover ice jam soil freezing are factors of relevance for the flood occurrences in poland furthermore intense precipitation in poland has caused urban flash floods in many cities e g pozna≈Ñ gda≈Ñsk and warsaw in the last decades kundzewicz and kowalczak 2014 bryndal et al 2017 climate change has a direct influence on river floods due to the shifts in climatic parameters such as precipitation and temperature consequently the increase of river flood hazard has become relevant due to the increase of the atmosphere water holding capacity field et al 2012 bl√∂schl et al 2019 and seneviratne et al 2021 moreover studies based on observations showed how the climate change has intensified the water cycle resulting in changes of the magnitude frequency and timing of river floods bl√∂schl et al 2017 model based studies aimed at assessment of future climate change impact on floods project a gradual increase in the magnitude and frequency of floods for a large part of the central european region under the rcp8 5 scenario alfieri et al 2015 the usage of the term flood in the present paper follows neither the colloquial understanding of destructive abundance of water nor the meaning accepted in the eu floods directive eu 2007 where the term flood is defined as follows the temporary covering by water of land not normally covered by water in the present paper we follow a stance taken in many scientific papers on flood trend change detection tackling high river discharges either via the notion of annual maximum flow amf or peak over threshold pot discharge there is a caveat though that in the former case the highest flow in a dry year may actually be in the zone of what is normally considered to be a medium discharge in contrast the latter approach deals only with really high discharges higher that a selected threshold in recent years several flood trend detection studies have been carried out at the national mediero et al 2014 petrow and merz 2009 and the european bertola et al 2020 bl√∂schl et al 2017 bl√∂schl et al 2019 kemter et al 2020 mangini et al 2018 levels methodologically such studies frequently use the non parametric mann kendall test mk and sen slope sen 1968 e g mediero et al 2014 mediero et al 2015 bl√∂schl et al 2017 mangini et al 2018 and bl√∂schl et al 2019 the test is applicable for non normal data distribution that is also for flood time series kundzewicz and robson 2004 stahl et al 2010 mediero et al 2014 moreover detection of trends in frequency of floods has been typically assessed using the chi square test frei and sch√§r 2001 vormoor et al 2016 and mangini et al 2018 at the national scale mediero et al 2014 analyzed the trends in magnitude frequency and timing of floods in spain finding a decreasing trend in annual maximum flow amf while the results for the peak over threshold pot showed a general decrease of magnitude and frequency petrow and merz 2009 detected positive trends in flood magnitude and frequency for a considerable number of studied basins in winter especially in the western and the eastern region of germany while mixed changes were found for the summer season in the south and the east parts of the country in a similar national study for poland piniewski et al 2018 found a general decreasing trend for the annual maximum flow with only 21 of gauges with an upward tendency over the country while grygoruk et al 2021 identified no trends in floods in the lower basin of the biebrza valley in north east of poland at the european level bl√∂schl et al 2017 2019 detected patterns in the magnitude and timing of floods with an earlier flood occurrence in the north east of europe and a flood magnitude decreasing in the eastern part due to an earlier snowmelt produced by a temperature rise they also mentioned that the flood discharge would decline in the southern poland from 0 1 m3 s 1 km 2 to approximately 0 075 m3 s 1 km 2 if a continuous decrease of discharge is present for the next years mangini et al 2018 searched for trends in magnitude and frequency of floods using both the annual maximum flow and peak over threshold methods reporting the highest positive trend in pot magnitude occurring in central europe also bertola et al 2020 who studied the difference in changes in small and large floods over the european region found an upward tendency in the northwestern europe similar to results of bl√∂schl et al 2017 2019 mangini et al 2018 mentioned that trend with both approaches is not always consistent which suggests that both methods should be used to capture uncertainty in flood trend detection moreover global scale and pan european studies e g villarini et al 2011b mangini et al 2018 do et al 2020 wasko et al 2020 on annual maximum daily discharge and flood trends have partially or completely left poland out of the analyses due to the lack of free access to polish data that persisted until recently meanwhile studies that included poland in their analysis e g bl√∂schl et al 2017 bl√∂schl et al 2019 bertola et al 2020 usually included the pre 2010 data floods can be characterized in quantitative terms in a number of different ways e g by magnitude frequency and timing indicators which belong together with duration and rate of change to the set of five components of flow regime which regulate the ecological processes in river systems duan and cai 2018 poff et al 1997 richter et al 1996 poff et al 1997 zhang and wei 2014 and duan and cai 2018 used these indicators to characterize high river discharges including floods in addition studies have shown the importance of these indicators for an overall and accurate description that allows a better understanding of flood processes and characteristics burn and whitfield 2017 mostofi zadeh et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 in this study detection of trends in a comprehensive set of indicators of floods in poland is carried out to fill in the knowledge gaps identified above the trend analysis focuses on observed daily discharge data processed using amf and pot methods the analyses are carried out for two different periods 1956 2019 and 1981 2019 characterized by different spatial coverage of flow gauge data 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area this study was carried out for a large set of catchments distributed across poland fig 1 located mainly in drainage basins of two large rivers the vistula and the odra vob region for the sake of synthetizing results we used the generalized boundaries of river basin districts aligned with those assumed in the eu floods directive reports provided by the polish water authorities to the european commission since some of these so called water regions were very small we merged them with their larger neighbors in result 12 water regions hereafter called river basins were distinguished fig 1 the median area of these river basins is equal to 26 761 km2 the climate of poland is characterized by the influence of air masses from the atlantic ocean and the eurasian land the country is located in a transitional warm temperate climatic zone b≈Çazejczyk 2006 the annual average temperature 7 9 c kundzewicz and matczak 2012 is increasing with the global warming spatially it ranges from 6 c in the northeast to 10 c in the southwest and in the highest mountain it is below 0 c in addition the annual total precipitation for the northern and central belt is approximately 500 700 mm year while in the southern and the mountain region the total precipitation attain values around 780 and 1100 mm respectively b≈Çazejczyk 2006 two dominant land use and land cover classes are agriculture and forests that occupy 63 and 32 of polish territory respectively there is no strong spatial gradient in land use but agricultural areas prevail mainly in the central part of the country southern higher elevated part of poland features more impermeable soils soil cover in the rest of the country that was shaped by numerous glaciations is highly variable in space soil permeability ranges from very low e g in the vistula river delta to high different clusters located mainly in central poland 2 2 river flow data the data analyzed in this study were extracted from the institute of meteorology and water management national research institute imgw pib holdings the selection took into account the balance between the number of gauges in particular regions and the available length of the time series as described in piniewski et al 2018 who used 147 flow gauges in poland the selected gauges are also free of important human influences on the flow regime such as presence of large dams located upstream since flow gauges differed with respect to the start date of hydrologic measurements it was decided to conduct the analyses separately for two scenarios the subset a consisting of 58 gauges with data available from 1956 to 2019 thus maximizing the temporal coverage and the subset b including all 146 gauges thus maximizing spatial coverage with data from 1981 to 2019 fig 1 the choice followed the database initially assembled by piniewski et al 2018 and updated here by adding data from three recent years 2017 2019 the median of catchment areas is equal to 551 km2 with a minimum and maximum catchment area of 6 and 6931 km2 respectively for the whole dataset 2 3 indices of floods the indices to determine the changes in indicators of floods are compiled in table 1 the annual maximum river flow denoted as q max is the maximum of the discharge recorded in a hydrological year in poland it is assumed as 1 november 30 october while the concept of peak over threshold pot is based on the peaks above a defined threshold level cunnane 1973 madsen et al 1997 mangini et al 2018 the q max series were extracted from the daily discharge data set as the maximum value in a hydrological year for each of the gauges for determination of the half year indicators denoted as q maxtwi and q maxtsu for winter and summer respectively maximum flow values per half year were extracted from the data set the pot approach detects all high flows exceeding a specific threshold not just one high flow event per year such as in annual maximum flow davison and smith 1990 villarini et al 2011a that is the number of episodes in one year can be different from one being zero or an integer number 1 2 3 hence the magnitude and the frequency of high flows above a threshold can be determined in this case pot series were identified from a predefined quantile 92 5th 95th or 97 5th percentile as a threshold the percentiles were selected as a threshold depending on the variable study conditions villarini et al 2011a ward et al 2018 kumar et al 2020 gupta and dhanya 2020 in order to obtain an appropriate number of events during the year at least 30 and not more than 3 n for the whole pot time series where n is the length of time series the great majority of gauges 123 of the whole dataset were assigned to the 97 5th threshold however for some gauges located mainly in the northern part of poland but not very close to the coast this threshold had to be reduced in order to grasp a higher number of pot events in our study a dependence criterion of 30 day was arbitrarily selected to define independent peaks between two consecutive events mallakpour and villarini 2015 for describing the changes in magnitude of floods the analyses were processed with both pot magnitude and q max magnitude denoted as potm and q maxm respectively while for flood frequency they were focused on pot approach and the frequency of exceedance was denoted as potf the changes in flood timing were assessed based on q max approach separately for annual and sub annual periods summer and winter half years i e november april and may october respectively to detect the day of occurrence of the events the trends of q max timing is presented with an annual and a seasonal approach summer and winter half year by the application of mean day of high flow mdf where the dates of flood timing were converted into an angular value macdonald et al 2010 mediero et al 2014 bl√∂schl et al 2017 do et al 2020 wasko et al 2020 as per the following equations 1 ij df ij 2 œÄ j d 2 j t a n 1 y x when x 0 y 0 j t a n 1 y x œÄ when x 0 j t a n 1 y x 2 œÄ when x 0 y 0 3 x 1 p i 1 e cos ij 4 y 1 p i 1 e sin ij 5 mdf j j j d 2 œÄ where df ij is the date of occurrence of a maximum flow in a hydrological year j represents the direction of the angle x and »≥ are the cosine and sine components of the mean date of a maximum flow j d shows the average number of days per year 365 25 used and p is the number of peaks in the time series the reader is referred to literature such as bl√∂schl et al 2017 and mediero et al 2014 for more details on mdf calculation 2 4 trend analyses following studies on river flood indicators bl√∂schl et al 2017 2019 mangini et al 2018 mediero et al 2014 we used the non parametric mann kendall test mk and sen slope sen 1968 in the trend detection process for potm q maxm and for flood timing based on q maxtan q maxtwi and q maxtsu sen method sen 1968 was applied to estimate magnitude of trends due to its greater robustness to outliers than the parametric analysis piniewski et al 2018 in this process the median slope of every possible ordered pair of the time series is calculated additionally the trends detected were evaluated for significance using the mk test with p values at a significance level of 10 0 1 in consistence with other recent flood trend studies such as vormoor et al 2016 bl√∂schl et al 2017 bl√∂schl et al 2019 tramblay et al 2019 and do et al 2020 kundzewicz and robson 2004 as well as mediero et al 2014 explained that the mk test is applicable for flood time series especially because hydrological data usually have a non normal distribution for more details on trend calculation the reader is referred to mediero et al 2014 and mangini et al 2018 in this study the mann kendall test is based on eqs 7 8 7 s i 1 n 1 j 1 1 n sgn x j x i 8 sgn x j x i 1 if x j x i 0 0 if x j x i 0 1 if x j x i 0 where x j and x i are the values sorted by data sequence and n is the length of the data set frei and sch√§r 2001 vormoor et al 2016 and mangini et al 2018 detected that the chi square test on parametric poisson regression is a feasible alternative for trends in potf because it is able to fit the series of count assuming that such count has a poisson distribution that varies linearly over time mangini et al 2018 this analysis was carried out in r kendall and zyp packages by the implementation of a code developed by mangini et al 2018 trend results of potm and q maxm were converted into a percent change per decade gudmundsson et al 2019 stahl et al 2012 which eases interpretation and comparability of results the percent change per decade sm is defined by eq 9 9 s m s c x 10 years x x 100 where sm is the trend in percentage change per decade s c is the sen slope and x is the average of the annual flood time series then changes in potf and q maxt with an annual and a seasonal approach are presented in events per decade by eq 10 10 sf sc x 10 years where sf is the trend in events per decade and s c is the sen slope by chi square test on parametric poisson regression in the case of frequency 3 results 3 1 trends in q max and pot magnitude the analyses of the q maxm showed a strong and consistent pattern a general downward trend for both subsets and both approaches was observed with statistically significant decreases of more than 15 per decade at some gauges the time series of q maxm manifests stronger changes fig 2 a b than potm fig 2 c d for instance in the north east region lower vistula pregolya narew q maxm has the highest downward tendency in both subsets in comparison to potm fig 2 c d changes are less pronounced for the subset a with smaller number of gauges but longer time series of records than for the subset b this holds for pot and q max method where a positive tendency is found in the south east region particularly in the upper vistula basin where the percentage increase for q maxm is around 5 15 fig 2b but with no statistical significance for potm the variation of change is between 0 and 5 per decade in the south east region fig 2 d the trend results for all river basins are summarized in table 2 where the percentage of gauges exhibiting significant positive or negative trends is shown for the two subsets a general downward trend is observed for almost all the river basins for both subsets at the national level for q maxm there is a temporal stability in detected trends with roughly 75 of gauges with decreasing trends irrespective of the starting year for potm the evidence for decreasing trends is stronger for subset a 76 of gauges and 28 with significance than b 64 and 11 with significance for q maxm nine river basins all but the upper vistula east and west as well as the bug exhibit downward trends in at least 73 of gauges for both subsets it is interesting that although downward trend magnitude is lower for the subset a statistical significance is much more frequent 53 of gauges than for the subset b 17 the largest difference between two approaches can be found for the middle vistula basin in subset b for which 47 of gauges show insignificant decreasing trend in potm and 73 in q maxm 3 2 trends in pot frequency the frequency of flood events is determined on the basis of pot series fig 3 illustrates the spatial changes of flood events per decade with higher variability for the long time series this result is similar to findings for q maxm and potm presented in fig 2 the pattern of potf has a negative trend for the northern part of the country for each period while in the southern regions various trend directions were found but upward trends prevail some gauges in the eastern regions are characterized by a positive tendency in both periods the narew the bug and the upper vistula west and east have the higher values for the period 1981 2019 detected trends in flood frequency have low magnitude and in great majority they are insignificant in both periods subsets a and b none of the gauges from subset a has an upward trend higher than 0 2 events per decade and only two one gauge in the northeast region with significant change out of 146 gauges from the subset b have such trend indeed the main similarity between the two subsets is the increasing trend in the southern part of poland mostly in vicinity of the slovakian border and the decreasing tendency in the north east region one difference is detected in the eastern part bug region with a downward pattern in the subset a and an upward in the subset b table 3 supports the findings from fig 3 where a common decreasing trend is found at the national level potf has a decreasing trend in 71 7 with significance and 66 3 with significance of gauges for the subsets a and b respectively which shows that the temporal stability is in place in some river basins there is no clear pattern for example in the upper vistula west half of gauges point at upward downward trend in pot frequency irrespective of the time period another extreme case is the noteƒá basin for which upward trends occur in all two gauges from subset a whereas all eight gauges exhibit downward trends in subset b just one with statistically significant change an insignificant upward tendency for 67 six out of nine of gauges was found in the bug basin for the subset b however the subset a displayed an insignificant increase of 14 one gauge for the same area in addition an insignificant downward trend in 100 of gauges for the subset a in the pregolya and upper odra was detected similar to the period of 1981 2019 with 100 and 75 for pregolya and upper odra basin respectively the potf at the national scale presents an increase for the subset b of 34 of gauges with a positive trend in summary based on potf results we have detected a moderate but mostly insignificant downward change in flood frequency mainly in the northern part of poland for the subset b the notec the warta the pregolya and the lower vistula basins where the decrease is consistent and described by values not exceeding 0 2 flood events per decade 3 3 trends in q max timing before results on trends in q max timing are presented the average timing of river floods in the observation record is shown in fig 4 the spatial pattern in the subsets a and b for the q maxtan fig 4 a b shows that average flood timing varies between february and april for most of the country lowland part whereas in mountainous south the average flood timing is from may till july due to different flood generation mechanisms in different parts of poland a mixture of snowmelt heavy rainfall in summer and winter precipitation the average timing of annual floods reflects both years with spring or winter floods predominant in the centre and north and summer floods prevailing in the south a different trend pattern can arise once the flood timing is analyzed separately for winter and summer half years for which flood generation mechanisms are more consistent the q maxtsu for both subsets fig 4 c d exhibit an interesting spatial pattern with the earliest occurrence of summer half year flood peaks in north eastern and central part of poland typically june gauges located close to the coast and in the upland part in the south are characterized by flood peaks occurring in july june july is the average flood timing period in summer half year for the southern most gauges in the carpathian and the sudety mountains a more spatially uniform pattern occurs in winter half year flood peak timing fig 4 e f in this case the pattern resembles to much extent that for the annual timing except for gauges in southern mountainous area the earliest occurrence of winter floods february occurs in the coastal parts of the country and the latest in the north east the results of changes for the time occurrences of flood series are presented in fig 5 the changes are expressed as number of days per decade which allows to detect an earlier or later incidence of flood peaks spatial pattern of trends shown in fig 5 a b is more complex than respective patterns in flood magnitude and frequency across poland and there is a lower statistical significance in comparison to q maxm the patterns for two subsets a and b are not fully consistent and also the magnitude of trends is higher for the second subset in general decreasing trends prevail especially in the southern part of the country both mountains and upland regions in the north east the pattern is highly mixed with neighboring gauges showing changes of large magnitude and opposing directions in the north western part of poland there is a dominant increasing trend with significant changes for one gauge in the subset b though a different pattern with more robust results for the larger subset restricted to the period 1981 2019 than for the smaller subset restricted to 1956 2019 can be found for trends in q maxtsu fig 5c d in this case a tendency for earlier flood occurrence dominates throughout the whole country especially for subset b the largest magnitude of this decrease exceeding 8 days per decade can be observed for gauges located in the upland part in the south and in the proximity of the coast in the north for subset a increasing statistically significant trends can be found mostly for the eastern part for q maxtwi fig 5 e f the country is roughly divided into two halves with increasing trends dominating in the north except for the northern part of the lower vistula basin and decreasing in the south except for the southern part of the upper vistula west basin which generally resembles trends for the annual flood timing the pattern is generally consistent across two subsets with lower magnitude of trends detected for the longer period statistical significance occurs only in several gauges located mainly in the northeast subset b in summary the trends in q max timing for annual and sub annual data with the percentage and number of gauges with statistical significance are presented in tables 4 and 5 respectively when looking at particular basins in some cases we can observe high sensitivity to the time period selected for analysis for example in the upper odra and the upper vistula west basins significantly higher fraction of gauges was pointing at insignificant decreasing trends for subset a than b this may be related to the acceleration of warming and in consequence snowmelt in the second part of the analyzed period on the other hand for summer and winter flood timing the trends were more consistent between the two time periods table 5 the summer half year illustrated a strong decreasing trend in almost all the regions of poland for both subsets with 10 of gauges showing statistical significance for 1956 2019 7 for 1981 2019 an upward tendency was detected for the winter half year timing in the northern regions where in the lower odra and narew basins there were later occurrences in 75 and 68 of gauges for subset b while in the lower vistula basin increasing trend was detected in 80 of gauges for subset a nevertheless for only 5 of all streamflow gauges the change for q maxtwin was statistically significant 4 discussion the trend detection of various flood indicators is important for understanding of the observed changes in flood pattern in poland the use of two complimentary methods pot and q max series allows for a more comprehensive examination of the magnitude frequency and timing of high flow episodes this topic has been rarely studied in poland while pan european and global scale studies dealing with changes in flood hazard have typically left the country out of analysis due to the lack of free access to flow data to our knowledge there is no study that used comparably recent data for trend detection in flood indices in this region with an exception of piniewski et al 2018 who nevertheless studied only one flood indicator q maxm 4 1 trends in flood magnitude the trend detection in flood magnitude via q maxm showed a visible spatial variability and statistical significance in both periods including 58 of all the gauges in subset a and 18 in subset b the decreases were detected mainly in the northern river basins while the increases were present in the south of the country the highest downward change in percent per decade in all the cases was detected in the northeast with values about 15 per decade the statistical significance was also most frequent in this region for example in the narew basin changes at 87 5 of all gauges for the period 1956 2019 were significant for q maxm this overall result is in agreement with that reported by piniewski et al 2018 who found the strongest decreasing trend in the northern part of poland and a moderate increase in the southern most mountainous part close to the border with slovakia direct comparison of our results with those from other authors of publications on changes in flood hazard is a challenge due to different study emphases and coverage area nevertheless our results show a generally coherent pattern with previous european studies of bl√∂schl et al 2019 bertola et al 2020 and slater et al 2021 bl√∂schl et al 2019 who studied trends in flood magnitude in europe based on european flood database by hall et al 2015 for 1960 2010 using the time series of annual maxima of daily mean or instantaneous discharge data found a rather complex pattern in mean annual flood change over poland while the majority of the territory including the entire eastern and interior parts exhibited downward trend below 5 per decade upward trends were also noted in two regions the northern edge close to the baltic sea coast weak trend and a smaller south eastern edge with a slightly stronger magnitude of trend the spatial pattern revealed by our analyses matches the one discovered by bl√∂schl et al 2019 quite well although we have not found a weak increasing trend in the coastal region a different pattern of trends in the northern regions of poland was found by bertola et al 2020 who analyzed trends in 100 year and 2 year floods in europe for small and large catchments based on the same european flood database of hall et al 2015 as bl√∂schl et al 2019 they found that northern poland features a decrease in flood magnitude for both recurrence levels and catchment size classes as supported by our findings in contrast kundzewicz et al 2018 studied the spatial temporal change of numbers of large floods in the whole of europe based on flood data from the dartmouth flood observatory dataset where large floods were defined as those with severity and magnitude greater than a selected threshold they detected larger floods between 1985 and 2016 in the southern part of poland as our main results for q maxm where heavy and prolonged precipitation 2 5 days are the most common flood generators in the area kundzewicz et al 2014b and ruiz villanueva et al 2016 our findings are also consistent with slater et al 2021 who analyzed global changes in river floods with different probabilities of occurrence using annual maximum daily streamflow they found decreases in 20 and 50 year floods for central europe a region containing poland and this is consistent with our q maxm results the 20 and 50 year floods exhibited a clear downward pattern in most of the country except for a few gauges located in mountainous south a similar pattern as in our study in some river basins we identified a lack of robustness between the analysis performed for two subsets a and b characterized by different spatial and temporal coverage for example in the upper vistula west basin a decreasing trend in potm was found for the longer period 1956 2019 while an upward trend for the shorter time period 1981 2019 table 2 a similar pattern was observed by vormoor et al 2016 who studied trends for daily peak flow series in norway and found a higher number of stations with decrease in the longer time period than in the shorter period in addition mostofi zadeh et al 2020 mentioned that a predominantly increasing trend in a short period recent years could indicate a possible common driver of floods in a specific area this is consistent with our findings for the subset b for 1981 2019 overall the spatial patterns of change are different depending on the scale observed data and method applied for example masseroni et al 2021 who used daily streamflow data for 1950 2013 showed a general positive trend in annual streamflow volumes in the continental region of europe but with an opposite pattern for the majority of stations in slovakia close to the polish border this is a different pattern from the majority of reported literature and our study however it should be noted that their main focus was on annual discharge volumes and not on river floods as in our case drivers of changes in flood magnitude are still debated due to the lack of hydrometric gauges and large scale evidence bl√∂schl et al 2019 but one common result was determined in the northeastern europe where studies such as estilow et al 2015 bl√∂schl et al 2017 2019 and bertola et al 2020 mentioned an association between this downward trend and the increasing air temperature and earlier snowmelt this drop in flood magnitude closely follows larger decreases in mean snow cover depth in eastern poland szwed et al 2017 which have an impact on snow storage with low magnitude values negative changes per decade in both methods such as the downward trend flood in europe that madsen et al 2014 found for snowmelt dominated areas the downward trends in the north are related to a decrease in river discharge which is the dominant factor in this region kundzewicz et al 2018 indeed this decreasing trend over north western regions may also be associated with a negative phase of azores scandinavia oscillation aso index defined as the sea level pressure difference between the oscillations of gibraltar the azores and haparandain sweden and gibraltar and vestervig in denmark generating a dry climate over north and central western europe willems 2013 the increases prevailing in the southern part are associated with heavy and prolonged precipitation 2 5 days especially in the mountain areas kundzewicz et al 2014b and ruiz villanueva et al 2016 in fact both patterns decreases in the north and small increases in the south are corroborated by the results of piniewski et al 2018 who also studied q maxm indicator for the time period reaching 2016 4 2 trends in flood frequency analysis of changes in pot frequency did not demonstrate an evident and significant trend due to the low values of changes in events per decade detected even though the spatial distribution showed a particular decrease in northern part of poland and a mixed behavior in the south statistical significance of flood frequency was the lowest among all flood indices studied in the paper table 3 displayed a robust result of decreasing trend for potf in the pregolya basin in both subsets while a weaker robustness for the warta and the bug basins therefore it should be noted that the increase of flood frequency in the country is less common and it refers mainly to the southern area there are very few studies dealing with trends in flood frequency that we could use as a reference for comparison with our results for example mudelsee et al 2003 analyzed the occurrence rate of summer and winter extreme floods in the elbe and odra rivers and found a downward trend in winter floods for the past 50 80 and 100 years where the decreasing pattern was attributed to less severe freezing events during the study period they also showed a downward trend in frequency of extreme floods for the central europe area but with some increase during the past decades that could be explained by nonhomogeneous historical data records mangini et al 2018 analyzed the pot frequency for different regions in europe using mean daily streamflow data and found consistent negative trends in potf in the continental part of europe where many stations had results with change in the range from 0 2 0 events per decade similarly to our findings unfortunately the study did not include analyses with gauges over poland that could be compared directly with our results in contrast the global scale study of berghuijs et al 2017 reported increases in magnitude and occurrences of extreme corresponding to 1 30 annual exceedance probability floods in europe but the results were not presented at a finer than continental spatial scale and flow data from poland were not used in the analysis similar decreasing results in flood frequency was found by tramblay et al 2019 who used daily discharge data and associated the less frequent occurrence of floods above 95th and 99th flow percentile in the mediterranean region to the soil moisture decrease this decrease may compensate the increasing rainfall amount even more in areas with observed crop yields and a lack of urban areas tramblay et al 2019 the general downward trend found in our paper could be directly associated with the anomalies in the soil moisture around poland as detected by piniewski et al 2020 and pi≈Ñskwar et al 2020 also in their study on flood regime changes in europe hall et al 2014 reported a marked decrease in the number of observed flood events in the east of central europe with a variation of floods over poland strupczewski et al 2001 found a decreasing number of flood events between the decades of 1920 and 1990 while kundzewicz et al 2012 mentioned an increase of the number of regional flood occurrences during 1946 2010 in addition it is difficult to have direct comparison due to a lack of trend detection studies in flood frequency in poland and the results are still debated due to the lack of large scale evidence moreover the frequency as well as magnitude of floods could vary due to different factors such as deforestation river regulations climate variations and land use change for a specific area which would have a direct effect on the occurrence of flood events kundzewicz and schellnhuber 2004 in fact a recent finding of seneviratne et al 2021 at the sixth assessment report of climate change 2021 showed that the changes in frequency and magnitude of fluvial floods are more complex while pluvial floods are on the rise with increasing intense precipitation 4 3 trends in flood timing the river basins in northern and central poland showed a concentrated annual flood timing in february april while may june was the period of average flood timing in the southern most basins this is in agreement with studies of flood timing in europe based on observed data bl√∂schl et al 2017 hall and bl√∂schl 2018 wasko et al 2020 who studied trends in flood timing based on daily streamflow data at global scale showed an average flood timing in february march for the eastern part of germany and a limited part of western poland not fully included in the study which coincides with our results as well the flood timing between march may could be linked with the north atlantic oscillation nao and the snowmelt processes determining the runoff generation in spring march may due to the increasing winter temperature and changing precipitation pattern kaczmarek 2003 moreover nao characterized by a quasi cyclical change of atmospheric pressure in the icelandic low and the azores high influences the winter conditions over a large part of europe kaczmarek 2003 and kundzewicz et al 2019 detected trends in annual flood timing exhibited considerable spatial variability only 10 11 of gauges showed statistical significance which is less than for flood magnitude and more than for flood frequency the detected pattern of trends in annual q max timing partly agrees with the one identified by bl√∂schl et al 2017 who studied flood timing in europe using the european flood database of hall et al 2015 they detected two large clusters of increasing trends over north western and south eastern poland the north western part of poland specifically the lower odra basin and the northern part of the notec basin coincide completely with the increasing trend later occurrences for the subset b and partially for the subset a however in our study the south eastern region was characterized mostly by trends in the opposite direction especially for the subset of gauges with higher data availability 1981 2019 the end year of gauge data in the study of bl√∂schl et al 2017 was 2010 which may partly explain the different behavior given that the decade of 2010 s was extremely warm in this region of europe bl√∂schl et al 2017 also identified a strong trend of earlier flood timing in lithuania neighboring poland in the northeast in our case the results are slightly different because in the north eastern poland e g the narew and pregolya basins the pattern is mixed but increasing trends slightly dominate advances in timing of floods were found in the southern basins and the lower vistula basin for the annual data and for winter half years where the increased river runoff in winter is associated with a positive nao phase in this particular area of poland and over the north and north east europe wrzesi≈Ñski 2008 wrzesi≈Ñski and paluszkiewicz 2011 and kundzewicz et al 2019 also wrzesi≈Ñski and paluszkiewicz 2011 mentioned that after occurrence of a positive nao phase in a warmer winter with less snow meltwater floods are visibly lower this trend is also associated with the general behavior of north eastern parts of europe with warming and spring incidence of snowmelt bl√∂schl et al 2017 bl√∂schl et al 2019 in addition the floods in the lower vistula basin and the southern region of poland have been associated with cyclones which can move from the mediterranean region to central eastern europe that generates high precipitation amounts in the area van bebber 1891 wy≈ºga et al 2016 in fact volosciuk et al 2016 and tabari and willems 2018 mentioned that factors from the mediterranean sea such as atmospheric moisture and evaporation can be associated to flood events in central europe caused by intense precipitation in summer a global study of do et al 2020 investigating trends in the ordinal year of annual maximum streamflow showed that prediction of flood timing in central european region including poland is associated with low confidence which may partly explain the complex pattern of trends in this indicator in our study interestingly they also showed that three out of five global hydroclimate zones intersect poland which confirms the complexity of flood generation mechanisms and resulting flood timing patterns across the country 5 concluding remarks this study analyzed trends in magnitude frequency and timing of river floods over two periods 1956 2019 and 1981 2019 in poland the indices described annual maximum discharge and peak over threshold flow series the use of both methods allowed for a better understanding of changes in river flood indicators comparison of two different subsets of flow gauges demonstrates stronger trends for the more abundant subset with shorter time series 1981 2019 than for the less abundant subset with longer time series 1956 2019 trends in magnitude of floods calculated for pot and q max series illustrate a visible spatial variability over the river basins of the country with an evident statistical significance especially for the longer of two considered periods 1956 2019 a relatively strong downward pattern was found in the northeastern part of poland for both subsets analyzed while an increasing trend was obtained usually in the southern part of the country evidence for changes in frequency of river floods in poland was weak in contrast a strong pattern of advanced river flood timing was found over southern poland and an opposite trend in northeastern and northwestern poland all these changes that were detected for recent years may not necessarily continue in the future due to climate change and other factors this leaves an opportunity to study the attribution of changes in river floods as well as their future projections as a next step in addition the influence of climate variation on trend detection should be considered tabari and willems 2018 and tabari et al 2020 stated that climate fluctuations occur on different times and scales over a region e g in the rhythm of multi decadal oscillations which may impact the precipitation patterns that can turn into flood events in this case precipitation variability over europe is influenced mainly by ocean atmosphere circulation especially the north atlantic oscillation nao therefore the complexity of interaction between oceans and atmosphere makes it difficult to detect the principal driving forces of the oscillations and their influence on the variation of floods over the region willems 2013 finally the observed changes in magnitude frequency and timing of floods obtained in our research provide one of the first analyses of this under studied topic in poland we show that the patterns are complex and not always consistent with previous research which means that further studies are required it is especially important to enrich the knowledge

7983,study region the upper forested reaches of the ota river 24 4 km northwest of the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant was studied study focus there is concern about the effects of dissolved radiocesium 137cs released from forest litter on long term contamination of aquatic ecosystems caused by the fukushima nuclear accident therefore hydrology and water quality measurements were performed under base flow and storm flow conditions in a high dose rate forest watershed in fukushima prefecture to investigate the involvement of litter in 137cs release new hydrological insights for the region under base flow conditions the dissolved 137cs activity concentration significantly positively correlated with the dissolved organic carbon and potassium ion concentrations the main components leached from litter over the entire study period differences in the annual variations in the 137cs activity concentrations and potassium ion concentrations indicated that litter indirectly increased 137cs concentrations in river water by releasing potassium ions that caused 137cs to desorb from river sediment and riparian soil in each large runoff event the dissolved 137cs activity concentration was higher at the time of maximum runoff than at the start of the event the relationships between the dissolved 137cs dissolved organic carbon and potassium ion concentrations strongly suggested that 137cs leached from litter in runoff was directly responsible for the increase in the 137cs activity concentration in river water graphical abstract ga1 keywords 137cs litter dissolved organic carbon potassium ion leaching runoff 1 introduction it has been more than 10 a since the tepco fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant fdnpp accident in 2011 the general characteristics and behavior of radiocesium deposited on land and expected future changes in radioactive contamination of local river systems have been investigated in many studies onda et al 2020 there is great concern about forest and freshwater ecosystems near the fdnpp staying contaminated for a long time hashimoto et al 2020 imamura et al 2021 ishii et al 2020 wada et al 2019 it is therefore important to investigate the behavior of bioavailable radiocesium which is predominantly in the dissolved form in river catchments around the fdnpp forested areas are important sources of dissolved radiocesium in river catchments most of the highly contaminated areas in fukushima prefecture are forested and few attempts have been made to decontaminate these areas it has been found that dissolved radiocesium activity concentrations in streams and rivers in forested areas vary seasonally and are highest in summer iwagami et al 2017 nakanishi and sakuma 2019 and increase during rain runoff events iwagami et al 2017 muto et al 2017 shinomiya et al 2014 tsuji et al 2016 it has been estimated that dissolved radiocesium accounts for 30 of total annual radiocesium runoff in highly contaminated areas meaning runoff from such areas cannot be ignored tsuji et al 2016 dissolved radiocesium can be released through ion exchange desorption of radiocesium from suspended solids and bottom sediment or through radiocesium being leached from forest litter weakly hydrated ammonium and potassium ions can selectively desorb radiocesium sorbed to frayed edge sites fess on clay particles in soil and sediment fuller et al 2014 wauters et al 1994 it has previously been found that radiocesium leached from forest litter is one of the main sources of radiocesium to aquatic systems gomi et al 2018 kurihara et al 2018 muto et al 2017 nakanishi et al 2014 sakai et al 2015 however those studies only indicated the potential for litter leachate to act as a source of dissolved radiocesium to rivers because of the amounts of dissolved 137cs leached from litter in field or laboratory experiments using lysimeters kurihara et al 2018 nakanishi et al 2014 or because of the differences in 137cs activity concentrations found in litter and water before and after litter samples were submerged in stream water or distilled water gomi et al 2018 kurihara et al 2020 sakai et al 2015 sakuma et al 2020 few studies have been performed to determine how litter leachate directly contributes dissolved radiocesium to rain runoff and rivers iwagami et al 2019 analyzed soil water groundwater and surface runoff water during rainfall events in a small forest watershed and suggested that dissolved 137cs stored in surface soil after being leached from litter and subjected to lateral slope flow directly increases the dissolved 137cs activity concentration in runoff early in a rainfall event tsuji et al 2016 performed a survey but could not confirm that surface soil pore water contained sufficient dissolved 137cs to act as an important source of 137cs during dry periods preceding rain events probably because of 137cs adsorbing to the solid phase of the soil iwagami et al 2019 suggested that a hydrochemical approach using other chemicals as tracers is one of the most effective ways of improving our understanding of radiocesium concentrations in rivers in forested areas dissolved organic carbon doc and potassium ions are two of the most useful tracers radiocesium and doc have been found to be leached from organic soil or litter to similar degrees in laboratory and field experiments nakanishi et al 2014 tegen and dorr 1996 potassium ions are more readily eluted than other cations from the organic material in typical japanese coniferous and broadleaf forests in the earliest stage of litter decomposition nambu and yonebayashi 1999 and it has been suggested that potassium ions and radiocesium will be leached to similar degrees hilton and spezzano 1994 kurihara et al 2020 sakai et al 2015 potassium ions can cause cesium ions to be desorbed from clay minerals a detailed study in which variations in the concentrations of doc and potassium ions are compared with variations in the concentration of dissolved 137cs would improve our understanding of the effect of forest litter on the dissolved radiocesium concentration in river water the aim of the study presented here was to determine the degree to which forest litter leachate contributes to the dissolved radiocesium concentration in a river running through a forest and the mechanisms involved a hydrochemical approach was used to process data acquired in a multi year study involving regular measurements taken under base flow conditions and more intensive measurements made during several rain runoff events the study area was a highly contaminated forested river catchment that is partly in the difficult to return zone around the fdnpp here we first present temporal variations in the dissolved 137cs activity concentration in the river water when the river was at base flow conditions over 4 fiscal years 2014 2017 and when rain runoff events occurred because of three consecutive typhoons chanthu mindulle and lionrock in august 2016 the potential for 137cs to be leached from litter was confirmed by performing a simple batch experiment involving soaking litter from the catchment in distilled water direct involvement of litter in the dissolved 137cs activity concentration in the forest river and the release of 137cs into litter leachate produced through runoff was assessed from the relationships between variations in the concentrations of dissolved 137cs doc and potassium ions which would mainly have been supplied by soil organic matter including litter the effects of precipitation were investigated using data for multiple consecutive rain runoff events in a short period to improve our understanding of direct contributions of radiocesium in litter to the dissolved radiocesium concentration in river water tsuji et al 2016 previously described the dissolved 137cs concentrations in river water when the river was at base and high flow rates between april 2014 and july 2015 here data for the subsequent 32 months august 2015 to march 2018 are added and used to perform analyses for base flow conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study site was in minami soma city fukushima prefecture japan 24 4 km northwest of the fdnpp fig 1 the upstream part of the ota river on which the study was focused has a 21 0 km2 catchment area that is almost completely 99 2 covered with forest mainly of japanese cedar and oak the altitude of the study area is 160 720 m fig 1b and the bedrock is mainly granite and diorite national institute of advanced science and technology 2021 annual precipitation measured near the yokokawa dam discharge point 3 6 km northeast of the sampling point by staff at the dam control office was 1230 1885 mm in the study period water samples were collected from the upstream part of the ota river 37 57463 n 140 88126 e where the flow rate was automatically measured by staff from the dam control office mean 137cs deposition in the study area after the fdnpp accident calculated from data collected in the third airborne survey performed by the ministry of education culture sports science and technology 2011 was 1 9 mbq m2 the upstream part of the ota river was classed as a difficult to return zone even 10 a after the fdnpp accident litter and surface soil supply 137cs to the river water the 137cs activity concentrations in litter and surface soil from near the points at which litter was collected for the batch experiments described below were determined in august 2018 the 137cs activity concentrations in the litter layer l litter layer fh soil 0 5 cm deep soil 5 10 cm deep and soil 10 20 cm deep samples were 21 900 126 000 127 000 42 400 and 4010 bq kg dry weight respectively for a japanese cedar forest and 29 200 207 000 83 000 19 800 and 4170 bq kg dry weight respectively for a deciduous broadleaf forest the concentration sharply decreased as the soil depth increased like in studies at other locations in fukushima prefecture imamura et al 2017 takahashi et al 2019 this indicated that radiocesium was strongly adsorbed to the soil particles and would not readily become resolubilized and migrate the river flows downstream from the heavily contaminated forested area via yokokawa dam which is just downstream of the monitoring point and then toward cultivated land and residential areas 2 2 sampling and monitoring a 20 40 l river water sample was collected every 2 4 weeks from 24 april 2014 when the river was at the base flow rate a total of 56 river water samples were collected the samples were collected from the center of the stream using a bucket the radiocesium and dissolved component concentrations in the samples were determined river water samples were also collected from adjacent to a bridge using a bucket at the center of the stream or using an isco 6712 automatic water sampler teledyne technologies lincoln ne usa at 20 min to 1 h intervals during rain runoff events caused by three typhoons chanthu 16 17 august 2016 mindulle 22 23 august 2016 and lionrock 30 august 2016 the total amounts of precipitation measured near the yokokawa dam discharge point in the chanthu mindulle and lionrock rainfall events were 128 104 and 131 mm respectively a small rainfall event total precipitation 16 mm occurred 7 d before the first major rainfall event surface runoff water samples 2 l each were collected intermittently from the gully that was depleted under base flow conditions fig 1 using a polypropylene bottle during the three runoff events mean 137cs deposition in the valley area including the depleted gully was 1 1 mbq m2 the radiocesium activity concentrations in these samples were determined and the results were used to improve our understanding of the effect of direct runoff on the dissolved radiocesium activity concentration in the river during the rain runoff events direct runoff consisted of the return flow and this could be a pathway for released radiocesium because of the high infiltration capacity the forest soil river flow rates determined by applying a head versus flow rate equation to the water depth measured using a water gauge were determined by staff at the dam control office the flow rate was generally measured every hour but was measured every 10 min when the flow rate was high the river was considered to be at base flow rate when specific runoff was 1 0 m3 s specific discharge 0 17 mm h a hydrograph for the monitoring period is shown in fig s1 a tc 500 turbidity meter optex shiga japan was placed at the monitoring point in the river on 29 may 2014 and collected turbidity measurements in ftu at 5 10 min intervals the turbidity measurements were used to estimate suspended solid ss concentrations in the river water the relationship between the turbidity and ss concentration was established using separately measured ss concentrations as described in the next section the least mean square method was used to establish an equation to describe the relationship between the turbidity and ss concentration n 56 to allow the continuous turbidity data to be converted into continuous ss concentration data throughfall water samples were collected during the rain events and soil pore water and spring water shallow groundwater samples were collected under base flow conditions from the sites marked on fig 1b to allow the degree to which each source of water was involved in supplying dissolved radiocesium to the river to be determined the sampling methods were previously described in detail by tsuji et al 2016 2 3 litter batch experiment a simple batch experiment was performed using forest litter samples collected from japanese cedar cn and deciduous broadleaf bl forests in the most contaminated part of the catchment fig 1 on 5 april 2018 the aim of the study was to investigate radiocesium leaching from contaminated forest litter bulk litter in various states of decay was collected from an area of about 1 m 1 m at each of three points in each of the cn and bl forests near the river in the study area each litter sample was placed in a vinyl bag and mixed well then 850 g was transferred to the laboratory on reaching the laboratory each sample was immediately placed in a 20 l plastic container at 20 c then 17 l of distilled water at 20 c was added to give a wet litter to distilled water ratio of 1 20 this was the start of the experiment each container was kept covered with a plastic sheet to prevent evaporation as much as possible during the leaching experiment at 10 min 30 min 150 min 18 h and 1 week after the experiment was started the leaching water was gentle mixed and then 0 25 l was removed and passed through a hawp04700 0 45 ¬µm membrane filter millipore billerica ma usa the concentrations of radiocesium and other solutes in each leachate sample were determined it was necessary to determine the leachable radiocesium fraction ratio and temporal changes to allow this the total radiocesium activity in each litter sample before the leaching experiment was calculated by adding together the products of the sample water volume 0 25 l and the dissolved radiocesium activity concentration at times 10 min 30 min 150 min and 18 h the product of the water volume remaining in the container and the dissolved radiocesium activity concentration at 1 week and the total radiocesium activity remaining in the litter after the leaching experiment had finished at the end of the experiment each litter sample was allowed to dry in air and then mixed well three 100 g samples of each litter sample were dried at 110 c for 24 h and then ground the total carbon and potassium contents of the litter samples before the leaching experiment were calculated in the same way as the total radiocesium contents 2 4 measurements the influence of 137cs re distribution between the liquid and solid phases was minimized by collecting particulate bound and dissolved radiocesium in river water and shallow groundwater separately using two different types of cartridge filter the water samples were passed through the cartridges immediately after being collected a nonwoven fabric cartridge filter with 1 ¬µm pores rp13 011 japan vilene tokyo japan was used to collect ss tsuji et al 2014 and a nonwoven fabric cartridge filter impregnated with potassium zinc ferrocyanide cs 13zn japan vilene was used to collect dissolved radiocesium yasutaka et al 2015 the cartridge for collecting ss was guaranteed to collect 80 of the total ss with diameters of 0 45 1 ¬µm tsuji et al 2014 during the storm flow events large particles such as leaves and sticks were removed before a sample was pumped through a cartridge each throughfall water and soil water sample was transported to the laboratory and then passed through an hawp04700 0 45 ¬µm membrane filter millipore each 2 l river water sample was transported to the laboratory and the ss concentration was determined by passing the sample through a whatman gf f filter with 0 7 ¬µm pores cytiva tokyo japan the concentrations of the cations ca2 k mg2 na and nh4 and the anions cl no2 no3 po4 3 and so4 2 in each sample that had been passed through a 0 45 ¬µm membrane filter were determined using an ics 1600 ion chromatograph thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa the si concentration was determined using an icpe 9820 inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer shimadzu kyoto japan the doc concentration was determined using a toc l total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu after adding a certain volume of hydrochloric acid the total carbon contents of the litter samples after the batch experiments had been performed were determined using a sumigraph nc trinity total nitrogen and total carbon analyzer sumika chemical analysis services tokyo japan the potassium contents of the litter samples after the batch experiments had been performed were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy after each sample had been digested with a hno3 hclo4 hf mixture using a modified method published by takamatsu et al 2010 each cartridge filter or gf f filter with ss attached was dried at 105 c for 24 48 h the mass of ss attached to the cartridge or gf f filter was calculated by subtracting the dry weight of the used filter from the dry weight of the unused filter the 137cs activity concentration in the ss in bq kg was calculated by dividing the amount of 137cs found in a cartridge filter with ss attached in bq by the mass of ss attached to the cartridge filter in kg 2 5 radioactivity analysis the radiocesium activities in bq of the cartridge filters containing ss cartridge filters containing dissolved radiocesium and filtered throughfall rainfall soil and leaching water samples were determined using a gc2518 coaxial high purity germanium detector canberra japan tokyo japan and a seg ems gem 35 70 coaxial high purity germanium detector seiko eg g tokyo japan using gammastudio software seiko eg g the radioisotope sources mx033u8pp the japan radioisotope association tokyo japan and eg ml eckert ziegler isotope products valencia ca usa were used to calibrate the system the cartridge filters were analyzed directly using the system following a method previously described by tsuji et al 2014 and yasutaka et al 2015 throughfall rainfall or soil water was added to a 1 or 2 l marinelli container and then analyzed using the system 134cs and 137cs were detected but only the 137cs results are shown here because the 134cs concentrations in most samples were lower than the detection limit the detected 137cs radioactivity in each sample was decay corrected to the sampling date 2 6 statistical analysis 2 6 1 correlations between dissolved 137cs concentrations and water soluble substance concentrations the relationships between the dissolved 137cs activity concentrations and the concentrations of the main water soluble substances ca2 cl doc k mg2 na no3 si and so4 2 in the river water samples were investigated by performing single regression analyses using the dissolved 137cs activity concentration as the objective variable and the concentration of each water soluble substance as the explanatory variable the data acquired under base flow conditions and during the rain runoff events were used separately in these regression analyses for the base flow condition data correlation coefficients were calculated for each fiscal year and the entire study period to allow temporal changes in the relationships to be identified for the rain runoff event data correlation coefficients were calculated for each rain runoff event and for all of the events combined since the decrease in concentration due to natural decay within the year was within the measurement error range and was not significant enough to be taken into account the measured dissolved 137cs activity concentrations were used in the analysis without correction the single regression analysis results led us to investigate the effects of doc and potassium ions on the 137cs activity concentration by developing a linear mixed model for base flow conditions most of the 137cs that was deposited on the forest floor after the fdnpp accident was transferred from the litter layer to the surface part of the inorganic soil layer and has been retained and the 137cs activity concentration in the litter has decreased over time imamura et al 2017 takahashi et al 2019 however supplies of doc and potassium ions from litter to river water in the forested watershed will have been stable over time because there have been no large natural or anthropogenic disturbances that would have affected doc and potassium ions the 137cs activity concentration would therefore have tended to decrease each year the intercept changed and the effect of the doc or potassium ion concentration on the 137cs activity concentration may also have changed each year the slope changed we fitted a linear mixed model to the data using the log transformed 137cs activity concentration as the objective variable the doc or potassium ion concentration as the fixed effect and a random intercept and random slope for the fiscal years of interest as random effects the models with and without random intercepts and random slopes for the different fiscal years were compared using the akaike information criterion to assess the annual changes in the effects of the doc and potassium ion concentrations on the 137cs activity concentration the linear mixed model analyses were performed using package lme4 in r version 4 1 0 software r core team 2021 2 6 2 dissolved 137cs runoff the amount of dissolved 137cs in runoff during each runoff event was estimated using a power law relationship between the load l in kbq s calculated by multiplying the measured discharge q in m3 s by the observed concentration c in bq l and q determined by plotting l and q on a double logarithmic chart the constants a and b in eq 1 that gave the best fit for the log l log q relationship were calculated 1 l a q b the duration of each runoff event was determined from the times at which the flood hydrograph increased and decreased the start of surface runoff was indicated by a sharp increase in the hydrograph and the end of surface runoff was indicated by an inflection point in the decreasing part of the hydrograph the total amount of dissolved 137cs in runoff was calculated by adding together the estimated loads calculated using eq 1 for the duration of the runoff event the exponent in the power law relationship or the slope of the load discharge relationship plotted using logarithmic axes indicated the physical characteristics of the runoff event for example a slope of 1 indicated that the catchment behaved chemostatically i e the concentration remained constant as the discharge volume varied godsey et al 2009 therefore eq 1 was applied to the main water soluble substances as well as dissolved 137cs to assess the relationships between the concentrations and discharge volumes and the processes involved in dissolved 137cs runoff 2 6 3 temporal changes in dissolved 137cs activity concentrations a single exponential model eq 2 was used to assess the mid to long term decreases in dissolved 137cs activity concentrations and amounts of 137cs associated with ss excluding the effects of natural decay the equation did not include the effects of the period shortly after the fdnpp accident the equation was applied to the measurements made under base flow conditions like in a study performed by nakanishi and sakuma 2019 during the study period 2 c ÔΩî Œ≤ exp Œª k 2 t in eq 2 c t is the dissolved 137cs activity concentration bq l or the amount of 137cs associated with ss bq kg at time t after deposition a and Œª 0 023 is the 137cs decay constant 1 a constants Œ≤ bq l and k 2 1 a were determined using the least squares fitting method Œ≤ is the exponential term parameter k 2 is a coefficient describing the decrease caused by environmental factors the environmental half life t env a was calculated using the equation 3 t env ln 2 k 2 3 results 3 1 dissolved 137cs activity concentration under base flow conditions 3 1 1 temporal changes in the dissolved 137cs activity concentration the dissolved 137cs activity concentrations bq l 137cs associated with ss activity concentrations bq kg ss concentrations mg l and apparent distribution coefficients kd a l kg in river water under base flow conditions between april 2014 and march 2018 are shown in fig 2 the distribution coefficient kd was calculated assuming that the system was in equilibrium i e at steady state equilibrium and involving totally reversible processes but such a state will not be fully achieved in a fast flowing river in a mountainous forested area kd a l kg was therefore defined as the ratio between the 137cs associated with ss activity concentration bq kg and the dissolved 137cs activity concentration bq l in river water i e for the apparent distribution the dissolved 137cs activity concentration varied cyclically reaching a maximum in summer like in previous studies of rivers in contaminated areas under base flow conditions after the fdnpp accident iwagami et al 2017 nakanishi and sakuma 2019 the dissolved 137cs activity concentration corrected to 11 march 2011 significantly positively correlated with the mean temperature during the preceding dry period r2 0 55 p 0 001 as shown in fig s2 this implied that microbiological processes were involved in the supply of dissolved 137cs it has been suggested that forest litter decomposition is involved in the dissolution of radiocesium nakanishi et al 2014 sakai et al 2015 tsuji et al 2016 the calculated constant k 2 and half life t env were 0 27 r2 0 46 p 0 001 and 2 6 a respectively the half life was similar to the half lives calculated by nakanishi and sakuma 2019 from measurements made in the lower reaches of the ukedo river half life 3 7 a and ota river half life 2 4 a between 2015 and 2018 the 137cs associated with ss activity concentration geometric mean was 65 000 bq kg and the geometric standard deviation was 2 3 during the study period and did not have marked seasonal variations the k 2 and t env values were 0 39 r2 0 16 p 0 0046 and 1 8 a respectively dissolved 137cs was usually dominant and contributed 80 of the total 137cs activity concentration under base flow conditions because of the low ss concentration geometric mean 0 60 mg l geometric standard deviation 2 1 the lack of seasonal variation in the 137cs concentration and the different decay rates for dissolved 137cs and 137cs associated with ss strongly suggested that the sources and behaviors of dissolved and suspended 137cs are independent in the ota river under base flow conditions similar conclusions were drawn by ochiai et al 2015 and nakanishi and sakuma 2019 for rivers near the coast of fukushima prefecture consequently the kd a value fluctuated widely and did not have a statistically significant temporal trend as shown in fig 2 3 1 2 relationships between the 137cs concentration and the concentrations of other water soluble substances the results of single regression analysis of the dissolved 137cs activity concentration and the concentrations of the main water soluble substances ca2 cl doc k mg2 na no3 si and so4 2 in river water under base flow conditions in each fiscal year and the entire study period are shown in table 1 only the doc and potassium ion concentrations significantly positively correlated with the dissolved 137cs activity concentration in each fiscal year and the entire study period ammonium ions which can strongly affect desorption of radiocesium from the solid phase of soil were generally found at low concentrations often below the detection limit 6 ¬µg l so it was not possible to assess the relationship between the ammonium and dissolved 137cs concentrations the relationships between the dissolved 137cs activity concentration and the doc and potassium ion concentrations varied temporally in different ways fig 3a and b the best linear mixed model included a random slope for doc and a random intercept for potassium ions table s1 the estimated values for the best model are shown in table 2 the slope of the regression line between the doc and 137cs concentrations in 2014 had the steepest slope the decreasing random slope for the doc model shown in table 2 but the slopes of the regression lines for the relationships between the potassium ion and dissolved 137cs concentrations in the different years varied relatively little over the 4 a study period however the intercept of the regression line for the relationship between the potassium ion and dissolved 137cs concentrations decreased each year the decreasing random intercept for the potassium model shown in table 2 3 2 dissolved 137cs in runoff during the rain runoff events 3 2 1 137cs runoff characteristics the dissolved and particulate phase 137cs activity concentrations bq l and the ss doc and potassium ion concentrations mg l in the river water were plotted as hyeto hydrographs developed from the data acquired during each rain runoff event caused by three typhoons typhoons chanthu mindulle and lionrock in 2 weeks in august 2016 fig 4 for all of the samples collected during the three rainfall events n 59 the particulate 137cs activity concentration significantly positively correlated with the flow rate of the river r 0 65 p 0 001 and the ss concentration r 0 92 p 0 001 however no clear effect of the flow rate or ss concentration on the 137cs associated with ss activity concentration bq kg ss was found fig s3 like in previous studies of radiocesium dynamics during rain runoff events eyrolle boyer et al 2016 iwagami et al 2017 the maximum dissolved 137cs concentration around the time of maximum runoff during each rainfall event was higher than the dissolved 137cs concentration found at the start of the runoff event 0 40 bq l at the beginning and 0 58 bq l at the peak of typhoon chanthu 0 27 bq l at the beginning and 0 35 bq l at the peak of typhoon mindulle and 0 33 bq l at the beginning and 0 35 bq l at the peak of typhoon lionrock similar results were found for previous rain runoff events in the ota river watershed in 2014 by tsuji et al 2016 however the maximum concentrations and the concentrations throughout the runoff periods were lower in the second and third storm events than the first storm event the concentration ranges during typhoons chanthu mindulle and lionrock being 0 49 0 58 0 29 0 35 and 0 22 0 35 bq l respectively similarly the 137cs concentrations during the first second and third runoff events were 0 56 0 96 0 47 0 50 and 0 38 bq l respectively in the gully that was depleted under base flow conditions as shown in fig 1 the estimated total amounts of dissolved 137cs in runoff during the first second and third typhoons calculated using eq 1 using the estimated constants a and b shown in table 3 and the measured flow rates were 370 470 and 530 mbq respectively the total volume of runoff was lower for the first runoff event than the second and third runoff events even though the maximum dissolved 137cs activity concentration was higher for the first runoff event than the second and third runoff events which reflected the differences in scale of runoff during the typhoons the total runoff volumes in the first second and third runoff events were 0 96 106 1 7 106 and 1 8 106 m3 respectively the constant b values for the concentration discharge relationships for dissolved 137cs and the other soluble substances are shown in table 3 the constant b values for potassium ions and dissolved 137cs were very close to 1 0 for all of the runoff events this indicated that the potassium ion and dissolved 137cs concentrations in the river water during the runoff events were little affected by the flow rate of the river the constant b values for the geologically derived weathering products such as silica and calcium magnesium and sodium ions were all 1 0 for each rainfall event these substances tend to behave chemostatiscally even during runoff events godsey et al 2009 but it was interesting that the dissolved 137cs and potassium ion concentrations were more stable than the concentrations of the other substances as the flow rate varied doc was also the only substance with a b value 1 0 for each runoff event doc had particularly high b values for the second and third runoff events the apparent ss to river water partition coefficients kd a for 137cs for the three runoff events were between 7 8 104 and 3 1 105 but the partition coefficients for the different events were not significantly different the kd a values significantly but weakly negatively correlated r 0 29 p 0 024 with the ss concentrations under high flow conditions as shown in fig s3 which reflected the significant positive correlation r 0 32 p 0 012 between the dissolved 137cs and ss concentrations fig s3 3 2 2 relationships between the 137cs activity concentration and water soluble substance concentrations the correlation coefficients for the relationships between the dissolved 137cs activity concentration and the concentrations of the main water soluble substances in the river water are shown in table 4 significant positive correlations were found between the dissolved 137cs concentration and the doc concentration r 0 74 p 0 001 and the concentrations of potassium ions r 0 71 p 0 001 nitrate ions r 0 62 p 0 001 and calcium ions r 0 28 p 0 03 for all three runoff events suggesting that rainfall was directly involved in the dissolution and runoff of 137cs however this did not necessarily indicate that there were significant positive correlations during the individual runoff events in the third runoff event only weak positive correlations were found between the dissolved 137cs concentration and the doc concentration r 0 28 and potassium ion concentration r 0 13 plots of the dissolved 137cs activity concentration against the doc and potassium ion concentrations in the river water under base flow in 2016 and rain runoff conditions are shown in fig 5a and b respectively only the data under base flow conditions in 2016 were used for the comparison in consideration for the decreasing trend of 137cs concentration with time the dissolved 137cs activity concentration and doc and potassium ion concentrations in the surface runoff water samples collected in the gully that was depleted under base flow conditions were also plotted the slopes of the regression lines fitted to the plots of the dissolved 137cs activity concentrations against the doc and potassium ion concentrations were smaller for the rain runoff events than the base flow conditions this was particularly the case for the slopes of the regression lines fitted to the plots of the dissolved 137cs activity concentrations against the doc concentrations the dissolved 137cs concentration in runoff water collected from the gully that was depleted under base flow conditions increased as the doc and potassium ion concentrations increased and the datapoints were mostly above the regression line for the river water samples collected during the runoff events the ss concentration significantly positively correlated with the dissolved 137cs concentration for all three runoff events r 0 32 p 0 012 but not for all three separate events a statistically significant positive correlation was found only for the first event r 0 57 p 0 01 the ss and dissolved 137cs activity concentrations increased when the flow rate increased but not necessarily synchronously as shown in fig 4 additionally the percentage of exchangeable 137cs to 137c associated with ss did not vary significantly ranging from 5 5 to 7 3 regardless of ss runoff conditions or rainfall events in this study takechi et al 2021 it was therefore difficult to identify a direct causal relationship between the ss and dissolved 137cs activity concentrations during the runoff events similar conclusions were drawn from the results of a simulation study performed by sakuma et al 2019 using a kd absorption desorption model for the same river watershed sakuma et al 2019 were not able to reproduce increases in dissolved 137cs activity concentrations during rainfall runoff events 3 3 137cs leaching from litter leaching of 137cs started immediately after the cn and bl litter samples were soaked and continued throughout the soaking period the cumulative leached 137cs fractions after 10 min 30 min 150 min and 18 h of soaking of the initial amount of 137cs in the cn and bl litter samples were 0 42 1 3 and 1 9 5 8 respectively as shown in fig 6 these values were similar to the values after 20 min 140 min and 1 d of soaking 0 13 2 and 0 81 6 6 for cn and bl litter found by sakuma et al 2020 in a leaching test using litter samples after a litter bag experiment at a point close to where our litter samples were collected 137cs was leached more readily from the bl litter than the cn litter the leaching rates for both litter samples were highest immediately after soaking started as shown in fig 7 similar results were found in similar experiments performed by kurihara et al 2020 and sakuma et al 2020 even though different solid liquid ratios were used these results indicated that 137cs would be readily released from litter in the riparian area valley and lower parts of the slope when a water channel expands because of the water level rising or rain runoff this would directly affect the 137cs concentration in the river water the cumulative amounts of doc and potassium ions leached after 18 h of soaking were 0 089 0 0033 and 16 0 67 respectively of the total concentrations in the cn litter and 0 12 0 0066 and 20 2 9 respectively of the total concentrations in the bl litter as shown in fig 6 this indicated that doc in litter was much less readily solubilized than 137cs but that potassium ions were more readily solubilized than 137cs however like 137cs doc and potassium ions were leached fastest immediately after soaking started as shown in fig 7 it was therefore appropriate to focus on the behaviors of doc and potassium ions when evaluating the direct contribution of litter leachate to the dissolved radiocesium activity concentration in river water 4 discussion 4 1 effect of leachate from litter on the dissolved radiocesium activity concentration in river water under base flow conditions 4 1 1 direct involvement of litter indicated by the relationship between the radiocesium and doc concentrations the similar litter leaching patterns for 137cs doc and potassium ions indicated that litter leaching was directly related to the significant positive correlations between the dissolved 137cs activity concentration and doc and potassium ion concentrations in river water under base flow conditions shown in table 1 however the temporal changes in the relationships between the dissolved 137cs activity concentration and doc and potassium ion concentrations found through linear mixed model analysis the results of which are shown in table 2 and s1 indicated that doc and potassium ions were related in different ways to changes in the dissolved 137cs activity concentration in the river water doc as has previously been stated nakanishi et al 2014 can be used as an indicator of litter directly supplying dissolved radiocesium to runoff and river water the field lysimeter experiment results found by nakanishi et al 2014 indicated that the potential for 137cs in litter to dissolve decreased over time this supports the conclusion that the slope of the line describing the relationship between the doc concentration and dissolved 137cs activity concentration decreased year by year koarashi et al 2016 found that the downward 137cs flux decreased over time during a 4 a study and suggested that the amount of mobile 137cs in litter will decrease over time because the total amount of 137cs in the litter will decrease over time this conclusion was supported by manaka et al 2019 who found that the proportion of exchangeable 137cs in organic layer samples decreased markedly 2 4 a after the fdnpp accident and had become almost constant at 2 4 of total 137cs at the end of the study an annual soil survey in the study area indicated that the 137cs activity concentrations in the l and fh litter layers decreased over time and the concentrations in 2017 were less than half the concentrations in 2014 in both cn and bl forests takechi et al 2021 the decreases in the 137cs concentration in litter supported our conclusion that the potential for radiocesium in litter in the study area dissolving decreased over time 4 1 2 indirect involvement of litter indicated by the relationship between the radiocesium and potassium ion concentrations the small annual changes in the slope of the line describing the relationship between the dissolved 137cs and potassium ion concentrations indicated that unlike doc potassium ions played roles in addition to being useful for indicating the solubilization of radiocesium in litter the data indicated that the presence of potassium ions increased the radiocesium concentration in the study river and therefore that potassium ions were directly involved in radiocesium dissolution in other words potassium ions caused radiocesium to desorb from the solid phase of soil this would have occurred through potassium ions causing the selective desorption of radiocesium from clay particles in soil and sediment the soil and sediment in the fukushima area contain large proportions of clay particles which have many fess konoplev et al 2016 yamaguchi et al 2017 most exchangeable 137cs in soil and sediment in the study area would have been retained by fess tachi et al 2020 weakly hydrated potassium ions can selectively exchange with radiocesium attached to fess fuller et al 2014 wauters et al 1994 so can facilitate the solubilization of 137cs in soil and sediment murota et al 2016 found that 40 of the total amount of 137cs in a soil sample from around the fdnpp was desorbed by soaking the soil in a solution containing potassium chloride at a relatively low concentration 10 5 m k 0 39 mg l for a long period 139 d the potassium ion concentrations in the study river under base flow conditions throughout the year were 0 28 0 56 mg l but the concentrations tended to be higher in summer than at other times of the year the ss concentrations in the study river under base flow conditions were usually 1 mg l as shown in fig 2 this suggested that contact between potassium ions and river sediment or riverbank soil caused 137cs to become desorbed it has been found that 137cs fixation aging onto clay particles occurs more slowly in river sediment and riverbank soil because of the consistently wet conditions than in soil on a slope which repeatedly cycles between being wet and dry roig et al 2007 a lack of aging would mean the amount of exchangeable 137cs attached to fess and regular exchange sites would not decrease very much over time and that exchange with potassium ions the concentration of which remains stable over time would not markedly vary this may explain the lack of a clear temporal decrease in the slope describing the relationship between the 137cs and potassium ion concentrations however if there is a decline in total 137cs activity concentrations in river sediment and riverbank soil or if aging proceeds gradually in the future the slope will become more gentle the intercept of the regression line decreased markedly over time and this was confirmed by the linear mixed model analysis results table 2 a decrease in the ability of litter to supply 137cs may have contributed to this although more detailed analysis using a larger dataset will be required to reach a firm conclusion 4 1 3 mechanisms controlling the concentration of dissolved radiocesium in litter leachate and the effect on the radiocesium concentration in the forest river under base flow conditions groundwater runoff will be dominant most of the time under base flow conditions so contact between litter and river water will be limited to the river bed or near the river channel where the litter has accumulated increased microbial activity in summer because of higher temperatures will promote the leaching of potassium ions and radiocesium from accumulated litter on the river bed or near the river channel which will increase the dissolved radiocesium activity concentration by allowing radiocesium to be leached from the litter and by causing radiocesium to be supplied by river sediment through selective exchange with potassium ions the flow of a river under base flow conditions in summer will fluctuate because of the humid and rainy climate of the asian monsoon area ohte et al 2010 fluctuations in the river flow conditions will increase the chance and time of contact between the litter accumulated near the river channel and river water which will promote the supply of dissolved radiocesium and potassium ions the 137cs activity concentration in the litter decreased over time as indicated by the linear mixed model analysis results shown in table 2 so we concluded that the dissolved 137cs activity concentration in river water was more strongly affected by indirect contributions from potassium leached from the litter than direct leaching from litter under base flow conditions a future task would be to determine how to quantitatively estimate the ratio of the two contributions 4 2 effects of litter on the dissolved 137cs activity concentration in river water during rain runoff events 4 2 1 effects of litter leachate on direct runoff processes the flow rate of a river in a forested area will increase during a rain even because of direct runoff consisting of surface flow and subsurface flow on the nearby slopes direct runoff will therefore strongly affect the water quality in a river during a rain runoff event the slopes of the lines describing the relationship between the dissolved 137cs activity concentration and doc concentration were markedly lower during the rain events than under base flow conditions as shown in fig 5a this would mainly have been caused by constituents of the pore water in the surface soil layer being released and transported in flowing subsurface water as shown in table s2 regardless of the species of trees present pore water in surface soil to 20 cm deep in the riverine area or on the slopes generally contained doc at a higher concentration 8 7 17 mg l than the concentration in river water during a rain runoff event the increases in the doc concentrations in the river water during the rain runoff events were concluded to have been caused by influxes of substances leached from litter by rainfall and surface flow and substances released from soil pore water this conclusion was supported by the constant b values representing the load discharge relationship for doc being 1 0 during all the three rainfall events table 3 in a previous study the increases in the concentrations of biologically active constituents as the flow rate increased were attributed to leaching of the constituents from the organic soil horizons during periods of high flow rates walling and webb 1986 the dissolved 137cs activity concentrations in the soil pore water samples were all below the detection limit 0 55 bq l and were much lower than the concentrations in the solution after litter had been immersed in water for 10 min in the batch tests 12 4 1 and 46 4 9 bq l for the cn and bl areas respectively so mixing with soil pore water probably decreased the slope of the regression line for the dissolved 137cs activity and doc concentrations relative to the slope found under base flow conditions however as shown in fig 5a significant positive correlations between the doc and dissolved 137cs concentrations were found throughout the study indicating that substances leached from the litter were the dominant contributors to the concentrations in the river water during the runoff events the same conclusion was drawn from the relationship between the 137cs and potassium ion concentrations unlike the doc concentration the potassium ion concentration in the river water did not clearly increase during each rain runoff event because of the influx of litter leachate and soil pore water as shown in fig 5b this would have been because the potassium ion concentration in pore water in soil 20 cm deep 1 3 2 1 and 1 8 2 2 mg l for the cn and bl areas respectively as shown in table s2 was lower than the concentration in the river water however the potassium ion and dissolved 137cs concentrations significantly positively correlated supporting the conclusion that litter leachate directly contributed to the dissolved 137cs activity concentration in the river water during each runoff event the results for the water samples from the depleted gully that became a runoff channel only during the rain runoff events suggested that the water quality of the direct runoff was strongly affected by litter leachate the slopes of the lines describing the relationships between the dissolved 137cs activity concentration and doc and potassium ion concentrations were larger than the slopes of the lines describing the relationships in the river water during runoff events as shown in fig 5a and b the increase in the potassium ion concentration caused by potassium ions being leached from litter may have led to desorption of selectively adsorbed 137cs on clay particles in ss and river sediment like under base flow conditions however the 137cs desorption process has been found to be slow rather than instantaneous at the potassium ion concentrations we found liu et al 2003 murota et al 2016 sakuma et al 2019 found that even taking the effects of competing ions potassium and ammonium ions into consideration in a physically based numerical runoff model for the ota river catchment and decreasing the distribution coefficient 137cs kd from 2 105 to 5 104 l kg the increase in the dissolved 137cs activity concentration during a runoff event relative to the 137cs activity concentration under base flow conditions just before the event could not be reproduced but rather the concentration decreased these results indicated that desorption of 137cs caused by potassium ions did not strongly affect the dissolved 137cs concentration in river water during the runoff unsteady events during this study 4 2 2 mechanism involved in maintaining a high dissolved 137cs activity concentration under high flow conditions temporal changes in river channels occur particularly during runoff events caused by heavy rain in other words the river channel network expands meaning the direct runoff source area increases this greatly increases the likelihood of litter leachate directly flowing into the river this will probably cause a high dissolved 137cs concentration in the river water to be maintained during a runoff event expansion of the source area was also suggested from the relationship between the 137cs concentration in river water and the amount of 137cs discharged the dissolved 137cs activity concentration and potassium ion concentration were little affected by fluctuations in discharges in any of the runoff events as indicated by the constant b values shown in table 3 the simplest mechanisms for maintaining the concentration of a chemical as the amount of chemical discharged increases are the reactive surface area increasing and the reaction rate increasing godsey et al 2009 the batch experiment data clearly indicated that the amount of 137cs leached from the litter decreased as the soaking time increased it was therefore reasonable to conclude that the increase in the area contributing direct runoff strongly contributed to the 137cs activity concentration in the river water being maintained the almost instantaneous leaching of 137cs from litter although not as fast as leaching of potassium ions particularly bl litter during a runoff event as shown in fig 6 would have increased the supply of 137cs to the mainstream of the river as the source area expanded this conclusion was supported by the amounts of 137cs that could be leached from litter in the areas contributing to direct runoff being much larger than the total amount of dissolved 137cs in runoff during each rainfall event the estimated area of the valley that could have contributed to direct runoff was 3 2 km2 this was calculated from the topographic position index weiss 2001 using a moving window average of 20 cells and the topographic landform definition for a valley 1 0 standard deviation weiss 2001 these calculations were performed using the digital elevation model with a spatial resolution of 5 m geospatial information authority of japan 2012 and the arcgis 10 1 topography tools dilts 2015 in arcgis 10 3 software the estimated total amount of 137cs retained by the litter layer in the valley area was 5 5 105 mbq which was equivalent to 0 17 mbq m2 this was calculated by multiplying the total amount of 137cs deposited in the valley determined from the results of the third airborne monitoring study ministry of education culture sports science and technology 2011 by the proportion of deposited 137cs retained in the litter layer a retention ratio of 10 was used because that ratio was found in previous surveys imamura et al 2017 takahashi et al 2019 and in surveys of the study area the 137cs leaching potential for litter deposited in the valley was calculated by multiplying the estimated retention time in the litter layer by the cumulative leaching fraction determined in the litter batch tests fig 6 it is difficult to accurately estimate the time that litter in the field is soaked i e the litter leaching duration because of rainfall infiltration and surface flow so the cumulative leaching rates for litter in areas containing cn and bl trees were assumed to be 0 7 and 6 0 respectively the time from the flow increasing because of rainfall to the maximum flow rate 3 5 4 8 h for the three events was used as the leaching duration the estimated 137cs leaching potential for the litter in the valley calculated using the conditions described above was 3 9 103 mbq when all of the litter was from cn trees and 3 3 104 mbq when all of the litter was from bl trees these values were much higher than the total amount of dissolved 137cs in runoff during the three direct runoff events 420 600 mbq decay corrected to 2 july 2011 the third airborne monitoring day after the fdnpp accident this supported the conclusion that litter affected the dissolved 137cs activity concentration in the river water during the runoff events because the direct runoff area expanded during the rainfall events the results for the three runoff events caused by typhoons that struck the study area within about 2 weeks indicated that the dissolved 137cs activity concentration did not increase to the same degree in every runoff event even though direct runoff would have caused 137cs to be leached from the litter the potential for 137cs to be leached from litter was so much higher in the first storm event than the subsequent two events that the dissolved 137cs concentration in the river water increased markedly only during the first event sakuma et al 2020 soaked cedar and hardwood litter that had been used in degradation tests in litterbags and found that the potential for 137cs to be leached from the litter was affected by the degree of litter decomposition that had occurred which in the field will depend on the air temperature during the preceding dry period they also found that the potential for 137cs to be leached was decreased by prior precipitation three typhoons in a row struck the study area during the study period in summer when litter would have been decomposing faster than at other times of year the relatively dry period 7 d before the first typhoon would have allowed a relatively large amount of 137cs to become available for leaching however the leaching potential may also have increased during the dry periods before the second and third rainfall events but we concluded that the brevity of each of these dry periods and wash off that occurred in the preceding rainfall events explained the dissolved 137cs activity concentration in the river water not markedly increasing during the second and third runoff events the constant a values determined by fitting a line to the relationship between load and discharge a values 0 40 0 26 and 0 26 for the first second and third events respectively as shown in table 3 reflected the differences between the leaching potentials for the first and subsequent events we concluded that an increase in the dissolved radiocesium concentration in a river in a forested area during a rain runoff event would require both direct runoff to deliver litter leachate to the river and microbial degradation to have made radiocesium able to be leached little decontamination has been performed in the forest area so it is expected that dissolved radiocesium will continue to be released from litter in the future however the radiocesium content of forest litter tends to decrease over time by more than the decrease caused by natural decay as mentioned above so the leaching potential will also decrease over time the amount of dissolved radiocesium in runoff from a terrestrial area will therefore continue to decrease over time and the degree to which a rainfall event will increase the concentration of dissolved radiocesium in river water will decrease 5 conclusions the results of the water quality surveys under base flow conditions for 4 years and runoff observations during extremely intense rainfall events in the forested area strongly affected by the fdnpp accident led us to make the conclusions shown below 1 the dissolved 137cs activity concentration decreased over time but had a temporal cycle with a maximum in summer the dissolved 137cs activity concentration significantly correlated with the doc and potassium ion concentrations for each year and the entire period 2 the slope of the line describing the relationship between the dissolved 137cs activity concentration and doc concentration under base flow conditions decreased each year but the slope of the line describing the relationship between the dissolved 137cs activity concentration and the potassium ion concentration did not markedly change this suggested that the dissolved 137cs activity concentration was increased more by indirect contributions of 137cs desorbed from river sediment and riparian soil by potassium ions leached from litter than by direct contributions of 137cs leached from litter 3 during each runoff event that occurred in a short period during the study the dissolved 137cs activity concentration was higher when maximum runoff occurred than at the beginning of the runoff event however the maximum dissolved 137cs activity concentrations were lower during the second and third events than the first event 4 during the runoff events positive correlations between the dissolved 137cs activity concentration and the doc and potassium ion concentrations strongly suggested that direct contributions of substances leached from litter were important and that direct runoff was mainly responsible for the increases in dissolved 137cs doc and potassium ion concentrations in the river water however a clear increase in the dissolved 137cs concentration was found to require an increase in the 137cs leaching potential caused by microbial degradation during the preceding dry period and the effects of direct runoff credit authorship contribution statement seiji hayashi

7983,study region the upper forested reaches of the ota river 24 4 km northwest of the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant was studied study focus there is concern about the effects of dissolved radiocesium 137cs released from forest litter on long term contamination of aquatic ecosystems caused by the fukushima nuclear accident therefore hydrology and water quality measurements were performed under base flow and storm flow conditions in a high dose rate forest watershed in fukushima prefecture to investigate the involvement of litter in 137cs release new hydrological insights for the region under base flow conditions the dissolved 137cs activity concentration significantly positively correlated with the dissolved organic carbon and potassium ion concentrations the main components leached from litter over the entire study period differences in the annual variations in the 137cs activity concentrations and potassium ion concentrations indicated that litter indirectly increased 137cs concentrations in river water by releasing potassium ions that caused 137cs to desorb from river sediment and riparian soil in each large runoff event the dissolved 137cs activity concentration was higher at the time of maximum runoff than at the start of the event the relationships between the dissolved 137cs dissolved organic carbon and potassium ion concentrations strongly suggested that 137cs leached from litter in runoff was directly responsible for the increase in the 137cs activity concentration in river water graphical abstract ga1 keywords 137cs litter dissolved organic carbon potassium ion leaching runoff 1 introduction it has been more than 10 a since the tepco fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant fdnpp accident in 2011 the general characteristics and behavior of radiocesium deposited on land and expected future changes in radioactive contamination of local river systems have been investigated in many studies onda et al 2020 there is great concern about forest and freshwater ecosystems near the fdnpp staying contaminated for a long time hashimoto et al 2020 imamura et al 2021 ishii et al 2020 wada et al 2019 it is therefore important to investigate the behavior of bioavailable radiocesium which is predominantly in the dissolved form in river catchments around the fdnpp forested areas are important sources of dissolved radiocesium in river catchments most of the highly contaminated areas in fukushima prefecture are forested and few attempts have been made to decontaminate these areas it has been found that dissolved radiocesium activity concentrations in streams and rivers in forested areas vary seasonally and are highest in summer iwagami et al 2017 nakanishi and sakuma 2019 and increase during rain runoff events iwagami et al 2017 muto et al 2017 shinomiya et al 2014 tsuji et al 2016 it has been estimated that dissolved radiocesium accounts for 30 of total annual radiocesium runoff in highly contaminated areas meaning runoff from such areas cannot be ignored tsuji et al 2016 dissolved radiocesium can be released through ion exchange desorption of radiocesium from suspended solids and bottom sediment or through radiocesium being leached from forest litter weakly hydrated ammonium and potassium ions can selectively desorb radiocesium sorbed to frayed edge sites fess on clay particles in soil and sediment fuller et al 2014 wauters et al 1994 it has previously been found that radiocesium leached from forest litter is one of the main sources of radiocesium to aquatic systems gomi et al 2018 kurihara et al 2018 muto et al 2017 nakanishi et al 2014 sakai et al 2015 however those studies only indicated the potential for litter leachate to act as a source of dissolved radiocesium to rivers because of the amounts of dissolved 137cs leached from litter in field or laboratory experiments using lysimeters kurihara et al 2018 nakanishi et al 2014 or because of the differences in 137cs activity concentrations found in litter and water before and after litter samples were submerged in stream water or distilled water gomi et al 2018 kurihara et al 2020 sakai et al 2015 sakuma et al 2020 few studies have been performed to determine how litter leachate directly contributes dissolved radiocesium to rain runoff and rivers iwagami et al 2019 analyzed soil water groundwater and surface runoff water during rainfall events in a small forest watershed and suggested that dissolved 137cs stored in surface soil after being leached from litter and subjected to lateral slope flow directly increases the dissolved 137cs activity concentration in runoff early in a rainfall event tsuji et al 2016 performed a survey but could not confirm that surface soil pore water contained sufficient dissolved 137cs to act as an important source of 137cs during dry periods preceding rain events probably because of 137cs adsorbing to the solid phase of the soil iwagami et al 2019 suggested that a hydrochemical approach using other chemicals as tracers is one of the most effective ways of improving our understanding of radiocesium concentrations in rivers in forested areas dissolved organic carbon doc and potassium ions are two of the most useful tracers radiocesium and doc have been found to be leached from organic soil or litter to similar degrees in laboratory and field experiments nakanishi et al 2014 tegen and dorr 1996 potassium ions are more readily eluted than other cations from the organic material in typical japanese coniferous and broadleaf forests in the earliest stage of litter decomposition nambu and yonebayashi 1999 and it has been suggested that potassium ions and radiocesium will be leached to similar degrees hilton and spezzano 1994 kurihara et al 2020 sakai et al 2015 potassium ions can cause cesium ions to be desorbed from clay minerals a detailed study in which variations in the concentrations of doc and potassium ions are compared with variations in the concentration of dissolved 137cs would improve our understanding of the effect of forest litter on the dissolved radiocesium concentration in river water the aim of the study presented here was to determine the degree to which forest litter leachate contributes to the dissolved radiocesium concentration in a river running through a forest and the mechanisms involved a hydrochemical approach was used to process data acquired in a multi year study involving regular measurements taken under base flow conditions and more intensive measurements made during several rain runoff events the study area was a highly contaminated forested river catchment that is partly in the difficult to return zone around the fdnpp here we first present temporal variations in the dissolved 137cs activity concentration in the river water when the river was at base flow conditions over 4 fiscal years 2014 2017 and when rain runoff events occurred because of three consecutive typhoons chanthu mindulle and lionrock in august 2016 the potential for 137cs to be leached from litter was confirmed by performing a simple batch experiment involving soaking litter from the catchment in distilled water direct involvement of litter in the dissolved 137cs activity concentration in the forest river and the release of 137cs into litter leachate produced through runoff was assessed from the relationships between variations in the concentrations of dissolved 137cs doc and potassium ions which would mainly have been supplied by soil organic matter including litter the effects of precipitation were investigated using data for multiple consecutive rain runoff events in a short period to improve our understanding of direct contributions of radiocesium in litter to the dissolved radiocesium concentration in river water tsuji et al 2016 previously described the dissolved 137cs concentrations in river water when the river was at base and high flow rates between april 2014 and july 2015 here data for the subsequent 32 months august 2015 to march 2018 are added and used to perform analyses for base flow conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study site was in minami soma city fukushima prefecture japan 24 4 km northwest of the fdnpp fig 1 the upstream part of the ota river on which the study was focused has a 21 0 km2 catchment area that is almost completely 99 2 covered with forest mainly of japanese cedar and oak the altitude of the study area is 160 720 m fig 1b and the bedrock is mainly granite and diorite national institute of advanced science and technology 2021 annual precipitation measured near the yokokawa dam discharge point 3 6 km northeast of the sampling point by staff at the dam control office was 1230 1885 mm in the study period water samples were collected from the upstream part of the ota river 37 57463 n 140 88126 e where the flow rate was automatically measured by staff from the dam control office mean 137cs deposition in the study area after the fdnpp accident calculated from data collected in the third airborne survey performed by the ministry of education culture sports science and technology 2011 was 1 9 mbq m2 the upstream part of the ota river was classed as a difficult to return zone even 10 a after the fdnpp accident litter and surface soil supply 137cs to the river water the 137cs activity concentrations in litter and surface soil from near the points at which litter was collected for the batch experiments described below were determined in august 2018 the 137cs activity concentrations in the litter layer l litter layer fh soil 0 5 cm deep soil 5 10 cm deep and soil 10 20 cm deep samples were 21 900 126 000 127 000 42 400 and 4010 bq kg dry weight respectively for a japanese cedar forest and 29 200 207 000 83 000 19 800 and 4170 bq kg dry weight respectively for a deciduous broadleaf forest the concentration sharply decreased as the soil depth increased like in studies at other locations in fukushima prefecture imamura et al 2017 takahashi et al 2019 this indicated that radiocesium was strongly adsorbed to the soil particles and would not readily become resolubilized and migrate the river flows downstream from the heavily contaminated forested area via yokokawa dam which is just downstream of the monitoring point and then toward cultivated land and residential areas 2 2 sampling and monitoring a 20 40 l river water sample was collected every 2 4 weeks from 24 april 2014 when the river was at the base flow rate a total of 56 river water samples were collected the samples were collected from the center of the stream using a bucket the radiocesium and dissolved component concentrations in the samples were determined river water samples were also collected from adjacent to a bridge using a bucket at the center of the stream or using an isco 6712 automatic water sampler teledyne technologies lincoln ne usa at 20 min to 1 h intervals during rain runoff events caused by three typhoons chanthu 16 17 august 2016 mindulle 22 23 august 2016 and lionrock 30 august 2016 the total amounts of precipitation measured near the yokokawa dam discharge point in the chanthu mindulle and lionrock rainfall events were 128 104 and 131 mm respectively a small rainfall event total precipitation 16 mm occurred 7 d before the first major rainfall event surface runoff water samples 2 l each were collected intermittently from the gully that was depleted under base flow conditions fig 1 using a polypropylene bottle during the three runoff events mean 137cs deposition in the valley area including the depleted gully was 1 1 mbq m2 the radiocesium activity concentrations in these samples were determined and the results were used to improve our understanding of the effect of direct runoff on the dissolved radiocesium activity concentration in the river during the rain runoff events direct runoff consisted of the return flow and this could be a pathway for released radiocesium because of the high infiltration capacity the forest soil river flow rates determined by applying a head versus flow rate equation to the water depth measured using a water gauge were determined by staff at the dam control office the flow rate was generally measured every hour but was measured every 10 min when the flow rate was high the river was considered to be at base flow rate when specific runoff was 1 0 m3 s specific discharge 0 17 mm h a hydrograph for the monitoring period is shown in fig s1 a tc 500 turbidity meter optex shiga japan was placed at the monitoring point in the river on 29 may 2014 and collected turbidity measurements in ftu at 5 10 min intervals the turbidity measurements were used to estimate suspended solid ss concentrations in the river water the relationship between the turbidity and ss concentration was established using separately measured ss concentrations as described in the next section the least mean square method was used to establish an equation to describe the relationship between the turbidity and ss concentration n 56 to allow the continuous turbidity data to be converted into continuous ss concentration data throughfall water samples were collected during the rain events and soil pore water and spring water shallow groundwater samples were collected under base flow conditions from the sites marked on fig 1b to allow the degree to which each source of water was involved in supplying dissolved radiocesium to the river to be determined the sampling methods were previously described in detail by tsuji et al 2016 2 3 litter batch experiment a simple batch experiment was performed using forest litter samples collected from japanese cedar cn and deciduous broadleaf bl forests in the most contaminated part of the catchment fig 1 on 5 april 2018 the aim of the study was to investigate radiocesium leaching from contaminated forest litter bulk litter in various states of decay was collected from an area of about 1 m 1 m at each of three points in each of the cn and bl forests near the river in the study area each litter sample was placed in a vinyl bag and mixed well then 850 g was transferred to the laboratory on reaching the laboratory each sample was immediately placed in a 20 l plastic container at 20 c then 17 l of distilled water at 20 c was added to give a wet litter to distilled water ratio of 1 20 this was the start of the experiment each container was kept covered with a plastic sheet to prevent evaporation as much as possible during the leaching experiment at 10 min 30 min 150 min 18 h and 1 week after the experiment was started the leaching water was gentle mixed and then 0 25 l was removed and passed through a hawp04700 0 45 ¬µm membrane filter millipore billerica ma usa the concentrations of radiocesium and other solutes in each leachate sample were determined it was necessary to determine the leachable radiocesium fraction ratio and temporal changes to allow this the total radiocesium activity in each litter sample before the leaching experiment was calculated by adding together the products of the sample water volume 0 25 l and the dissolved radiocesium activity concentration at times 10 min 30 min 150 min and 18 h the product of the water volume remaining in the container and the dissolved radiocesium activity concentration at 1 week and the total radiocesium activity remaining in the litter after the leaching experiment had finished at the end of the experiment each litter sample was allowed to dry in air and then mixed well three 100 g samples of each litter sample were dried at 110 c for 24 h and then ground the total carbon and potassium contents of the litter samples before the leaching experiment were calculated in the same way as the total radiocesium contents 2 4 measurements the influence of 137cs re distribution between the liquid and solid phases was minimized by collecting particulate bound and dissolved radiocesium in river water and shallow groundwater separately using two different types of cartridge filter the water samples were passed through the cartridges immediately after being collected a nonwoven fabric cartridge filter with 1 ¬µm pores rp13 011 japan vilene tokyo japan was used to collect ss tsuji et al 2014 and a nonwoven fabric cartridge filter impregnated with potassium zinc ferrocyanide cs 13zn japan vilene was used to collect dissolved radiocesium yasutaka et al 2015 the cartridge for collecting ss was guaranteed to collect 80 of the total ss with diameters of 0 45 1 ¬µm tsuji et al 2014 during the storm flow events large particles such as leaves and sticks were removed before a sample was pumped through a cartridge each throughfall water and soil water sample was transported to the laboratory and then passed through an hawp04700 0 45 ¬µm membrane filter millipore each 2 l river water sample was transported to the laboratory and the ss concentration was determined by passing the sample through a whatman gf f filter with 0 7 ¬µm pores cytiva tokyo japan the concentrations of the cations ca2 k mg2 na and nh4 and the anions cl no2 no3 po4 3 and so4 2 in each sample that had been passed through a 0 45 ¬µm membrane filter were determined using an ics 1600 ion chromatograph thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa the si concentration was determined using an icpe 9820 inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer shimadzu kyoto japan the doc concentration was determined using a toc l total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu after adding a certain volume of hydrochloric acid the total carbon contents of the litter samples after the batch experiments had been performed were determined using a sumigraph nc trinity total nitrogen and total carbon analyzer sumika chemical analysis services tokyo japan the potassium contents of the litter samples after the batch experiments had been performed were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy after each sample had been digested with a hno3 hclo4 hf mixture using a modified method published by takamatsu et al 2010 each cartridge filter or gf f filter with ss attached was dried at 105 c for 24 48 h the mass of ss attached to the cartridge or gf f filter was calculated by subtracting the dry weight of the used filter from the dry weight of the unused filter the 137cs activity concentration in the ss in bq kg was calculated by dividing the amount of 137cs found in a cartridge filter with ss attached in bq by the mass of ss attached to the cartridge filter in kg 2 5 radioactivity analysis the radiocesium activities in bq of the cartridge filters containing ss cartridge filters containing dissolved radiocesium and filtered throughfall rainfall soil and leaching water samples were determined using a gc2518 coaxial high purity germanium detector canberra japan tokyo japan and a seg ems gem 35 70 coaxial high purity germanium detector seiko eg g tokyo japan using gammastudio software seiko eg g the radioisotope sources mx033u8pp the japan radioisotope association tokyo japan and eg ml eckert ziegler isotope products valencia ca usa were used to calibrate the system the cartridge filters were analyzed directly using the system following a method previously described by tsuji et al 2014 and yasutaka et al 2015 throughfall rainfall or soil water was added to a 1 or 2 l marinelli container and then analyzed using the system 134cs and 137cs were detected but only the 137cs results are shown here because the 134cs concentrations in most samples were lower than the detection limit the detected 137cs radioactivity in each sample was decay corrected to the sampling date 2 6 statistical analysis 2 6 1 correlations between dissolved 137cs concentrations and water soluble substance concentrations the relationships between the dissolved 137cs activity concentrations and the concentrations of the main water soluble substances ca2 cl doc k mg2 na no3 si and so4 2 in the river water samples were investigated by performing single regression analyses using the dissolved 137cs activity concentration as the objective variable and the concentration of each water soluble substance as the explanatory variable the data acquired under base flow conditions and during the rain runoff events were used separately in these regression analyses for the base flow condition data correlation coefficients were calculated for each fiscal year and the entire study period to allow temporal changes in the relationships to be identified for the rain runoff event data correlation coefficients were calculated for each rain runoff event and for all of the events combined since the decrease in concentration due to natural decay within the year was within the measurement error range and was not significant enough to be taken into account the measured dissolved 137cs activity concentrations were used in the analysis without correction the single regression analysis results led us to investigate the effects of doc and potassium ions on the 137cs activity concentration by developing a linear mixed model for base flow conditions most of the 137cs that was deposited on the forest floor after the fdnpp accident was transferred from the litter layer to the surface part of the inorganic soil layer and has been retained and the 137cs activity concentration in the litter has decreased over time imamura et al 2017 takahashi et al 2019 however supplies of doc and potassium ions from litter to river water in the forested watershed will have been stable over time because there have been no large natural or anthropogenic disturbances that would have affected doc and potassium ions the 137cs activity concentration would therefore have tended to decrease each year the intercept changed and the effect of the doc or potassium ion concentration on the 137cs activity concentration may also have changed each year the slope changed we fitted a linear mixed model to the data using the log transformed 137cs activity concentration as the objective variable the doc or potassium ion concentration as the fixed effect and a random intercept and random slope for the fiscal years of interest as random effects the models with and without random intercepts and random slopes for the different fiscal years were compared using the akaike information criterion to assess the annual changes in the effects of the doc and potassium ion concentrations on the 137cs activity concentration the linear mixed model analyses were performed using package lme4 in r version 4 1 0 software r core team 2021 2 6 2 dissolved 137cs runoff the amount of dissolved 137cs in runoff during each runoff event was estimated using a power law relationship between the load l in kbq s calculated by multiplying the measured discharge q in m3 s by the observed concentration c in bq l and q determined by plotting l and q on a double logarithmic chart the constants a and b in eq 1 that gave the best fit for the log l log q relationship were calculated 1 l a q b the duration of each runoff event was determined from the times at which the flood hydrograph increased and decreased the start of surface runoff was indicated by a sharp increase in the hydrograph and the end of surface runoff was indicated by an inflection point in the decreasing part of the hydrograph the total amount of dissolved 137cs in runoff was calculated by adding together the estimated loads calculated using eq 1 for the duration of the runoff event the exponent in the power law relationship or the slope of the load discharge relationship plotted using logarithmic axes indicated the physical characteristics of the runoff event for example a slope of 1 indicated that the catchment behaved chemostatically i e the concentration remained constant as the discharge volume varied godsey et al 2009 therefore eq 1 was applied to the main water soluble substances as well as dissolved 137cs to assess the relationships between the concentrations and discharge volumes and the processes involved in dissolved 137cs runoff 2 6 3 temporal changes in dissolved 137cs activity concentrations a single exponential model eq 2 was used to assess the mid to long term decreases in dissolved 137cs activity concentrations and amounts of 137cs associated with ss excluding the effects of natural decay the equation did not include the effects of the period shortly after the fdnpp accident the equation was applied to the measurements made under base flow conditions like in a study performed by nakanishi and sakuma 2019 during the study period 2 c ÔΩî Œ≤ exp Œª k 2 t in eq 2 c t is the dissolved 137cs activity concentration bq l or the amount of 137cs associated with ss bq kg at time t after deposition a and Œª 0 023 is the 137cs decay constant 1 a constants Œ≤ bq l and k 2 1 a were determined using the least squares fitting method Œ≤ is the exponential term parameter k 2 is a coefficient describing the decrease caused by environmental factors the environmental half life t env a was calculated using the equation 3 t env ln 2 k 2 3 results 3 1 dissolved 137cs activity concentration under base flow conditions 3 1 1 temporal changes in the dissolved 137cs activity concentration the dissolved 137cs activity concentrations bq l 137cs associated with ss activity concentrations bq kg ss concentrations mg l and apparent distribution coefficients kd a l kg in river water under base flow conditions between april 2014 and march 2018 are shown in fig 2 the distribution coefficient kd was calculated assuming that the system was in equilibrium i e at steady state equilibrium and involving totally reversible processes but such a state will not be fully achieved in a fast flowing river in a mountainous forested area kd a l kg was therefore defined as the ratio between the 137cs associated with ss activity concentration bq kg and the dissolved 137cs activity concentration bq l in river water i e for the apparent distribution the dissolved 137cs activity concentration varied cyclically reaching a maximum in summer like in previous studies of rivers in contaminated areas under base flow conditions after the fdnpp accident iwagami et al 2017 nakanishi and sakuma 2019 the dissolved 137cs activity concentration corrected to 11 march 2011 significantly positively correlated with the mean temperature during the preceding dry period r2 0 55 p 0 001 as shown in fig s2 this implied that microbiological processes were involved in the supply of dissolved 137cs it has been suggested that forest litter decomposition is involved in the dissolution of radiocesium nakanishi et al 2014 sakai et al 2015 tsuji et al 2016 the calculated constant k 2 and half life t env were 0 27 r2 0 46 p 0 001 and 2 6 a respectively the half life was similar to the half lives calculated by nakanishi and sakuma 2019 from measurements made in the lower reaches of the ukedo river half life 3 7 a and ota river half life 2 4 a between 2015 and 2018 the 137cs associated with ss activity concentration geometric mean was 65 000 bq kg and the geometric standard deviation was 2 3 during the study period and did not have marked seasonal variations the k 2 and t env values were 0 39 r2 0 16 p 0 0046 and 1 8 a respectively dissolved 137cs was usually dominant and contributed 80 of the total 137cs activity concentration under base flow conditions because of the low ss concentration geometric mean 0 60 mg l geometric standard deviation 2 1 the lack of seasonal variation in the 137cs concentration and the different decay rates for dissolved 137cs and 137cs associated with ss strongly suggested that the sources and behaviors of dissolved and suspended 137cs are independent in the ota river under base flow conditions similar conclusions were drawn by ochiai et al 2015 and nakanishi and sakuma 2019 for rivers near the coast of fukushima prefecture consequently the kd a value fluctuated widely and did not have a statistically significant temporal trend as shown in fig 2 3 1 2 relationships between the 137cs concentration and the concentrations of other water soluble substances the results of single regression analysis of the dissolved 137cs activity concentration and the concentrations of the main water soluble substances ca2 cl doc k mg2 na no3 si and so4 2 in river water under base flow conditions in each fiscal year and the entire study period are shown in table 1 only the doc and potassium ion concentrations significantly positively correlated with the dissolved 137cs activity concentration in each fiscal year and the entire study period ammonium ions which can strongly affect desorption of radiocesium from the solid phase of soil were generally found at low concentrations often below the detection limit 6 ¬µg l so it was not possible to assess the relationship between the ammonium and dissolved 137cs concentrations the relationships between the dissolved 137cs activity concentration and the doc and potassium ion concentrations varied temporally in different ways fig 3a and b the best linear mixed model included a random slope for doc and a random intercept for potassium ions table s1 the estimated values for the best model are shown in table 2 the slope of the regression line between the doc and 137cs concentrations in 2014 had the steepest slope the decreasing random slope for the doc model shown in table 2 but the slopes of the regression lines for the relationships between the potassium ion and dissolved 137cs concentrations in the different years varied relatively little over the 4 a study period however the intercept of the regression line for the relationship between the potassium ion and dissolved 137cs concentrations decreased each year the decreasing random intercept for the potassium model shown in table 2 3 2 dissolved 137cs in runoff during the rain runoff events 3 2 1 137cs runoff characteristics the dissolved and particulate phase 137cs activity concentrations bq l and the ss doc and potassium ion concentrations mg l in the river water were plotted as hyeto hydrographs developed from the data acquired during each rain runoff event caused by three typhoons typhoons chanthu mindulle and lionrock in 2 weeks in august 2016 fig 4 for all of the samples collected during the three rainfall events n 59 the particulate 137cs activity concentration significantly positively correlated with the flow rate of the river r 0 65 p 0 001 and the ss concentration r 0 92 p 0 001 however no clear effect of the flow rate or ss concentration on the 137cs associated with ss activity concentration bq kg ss was found fig s3 like in previous studies of radiocesium dynamics during rain runoff events eyrolle boyer et al 2016 iwagami et al 2017 the maximum dissolved 137cs concentration around the time of maximum runoff during each rainfall event was higher than the dissolved 137cs concentration found at the start of the runoff event 0 40 bq l at the beginning and 0 58 bq l at the peak of typhoon chanthu 0 27 bq l at the beginning and 0 35 bq l at the peak of typhoon mindulle and 0 33 bq l at the beginning and 0 35 bq l at the peak of typhoon lionrock similar results were found for previous rain runoff events in the ota river watershed in 2014 by tsuji et al 2016 however the maximum concentrations and the concentrations throughout the runoff periods were lower in the second and third storm events than the first storm event the concentration ranges during typhoons chanthu mindulle and lionrock being 0 49 0 58 0 29 0 35 and 0 22 0 35 bq l respectively similarly the 137cs concentrations during the first second and third runoff events were 0 56 0 96 0 47 0 50 and 0 38 bq l respectively in the gully that was depleted under base flow conditions as shown in fig 1 the estimated total amounts of dissolved 137cs in runoff during the first second and third typhoons calculated using eq 1 using the estimated constants a and b shown in table 3 and the measured flow rates were 370 470 and 530 mbq respectively the total volume of runoff was lower for the first runoff event than the second and third runoff events even though the maximum dissolved 137cs activity concentration was higher for the first runoff event than the second and third runoff events which reflected the differences in scale of runoff during the typhoons the total runoff volumes in the first second and third runoff events were 0 96 106 1 7 106 and 1 8 106 m3 respectively the constant b values for the concentration discharge relationships for dissolved 137cs and the other soluble substances are shown in table 3 the constant b values for potassium ions and dissolved 137cs were very close to 1 0 for all of the runoff events this indicated that the potassium ion and dissolved 137cs concentrations in the river water during the runoff events were little affected by the flow rate of the river the constant b values for the geologically derived weathering products such as silica and calcium magnesium and sodium ions were all 1 0 for each rainfall event these substances tend to behave chemostatiscally even during runoff events godsey et al 2009 but it was interesting that the dissolved 137cs and potassium ion concentrations were more stable than the concentrations of the other substances as the flow rate varied doc was also the only substance with a b value 1 0 for each runoff event doc had particularly high b values for the second and third runoff events the apparent ss to river water partition coefficients kd a for 137cs for the three runoff events were between 7 8 104 and 3 1 105 but the partition coefficients for the different events were not significantly different the kd a values significantly but weakly negatively correlated r 0 29 p 0 024 with the ss concentrations under high flow conditions as shown in fig s3 which reflected the significant positive correlation r 0 32 p 0 012 between the dissolved 137cs and ss concentrations fig s3 3 2 2 relationships between the 137cs activity concentration and water soluble substance concentrations the correlation coefficients for the relationships between the dissolved 137cs activity concentration and the concentrations of the main water soluble substances in the river water are shown in table 4 significant positive correlations were found between the dissolved 137cs concentration and the doc concentration r 0 74 p 0 001 and the concentrations of potassium ions r 0 71 p 0 001 nitrate ions r 0 62 p 0 001 and calcium ions r 0 28 p 0 03 for all three runoff events suggesting that rainfall was directly involved in the dissolution and runoff of 137cs however this did not necessarily indicate that there were significant positive correlations during the individual runoff events in the third runoff event only weak positive correlations were found between the dissolved 137cs concentration and the doc concentration r 0 28 and potassium ion concentration r 0 13 plots of the dissolved 137cs activity concentration against the doc and potassium ion concentrations in the river water under base flow in 2016 and rain runoff conditions are shown in fig 5a and b respectively only the data under base flow conditions in 2016 were used for the comparison in consideration for the decreasing trend of 137cs concentration with time the dissolved 137cs activity concentration and doc and potassium ion concentrations in the surface runoff water samples collected in the gully that was depleted under base flow conditions were also plotted the slopes of the regression lines fitted to the plots of the dissolved 137cs activity concentrations against the doc and potassium ion concentrations were smaller for the rain runoff events than the base flow conditions this was particularly the case for the slopes of the regression lines fitted to the plots of the dissolved 137cs activity concentrations against the doc concentrations the dissolved 137cs concentration in runoff water collected from the gully that was depleted under base flow conditions increased as the doc and potassium ion concentrations increased and the datapoints were mostly above the regression line for the river water samples collected during the runoff events the ss concentration significantly positively correlated with the dissolved 137cs concentration for all three runoff events r 0 32 p 0 012 but not for all three separate events a statistically significant positive correlation was found only for the first event r 0 57 p 0 01 the ss and dissolved 137cs activity concentrations increased when the flow rate increased but not necessarily synchronously as shown in fig 4 additionally the percentage of exchangeable 137cs to 137c associated with ss did not vary significantly ranging from 5 5 to 7 3 regardless of ss runoff conditions or rainfall events in this study takechi et al 2021 it was therefore difficult to identify a direct causal relationship between the ss and dissolved 137cs activity concentrations during the runoff events similar conclusions were drawn from the results of a simulation study performed by sakuma et al 2019 using a kd absorption desorption model for the same river watershed sakuma et al 2019 were not able to reproduce increases in dissolved 137cs activity concentrations during rainfall runoff events 3 3 137cs leaching from litter leaching of 137cs started immediately after the cn and bl litter samples were soaked and continued throughout the soaking period the cumulative leached 137cs fractions after 10 min 30 min 150 min and 18 h of soaking of the initial amount of 137cs in the cn and bl litter samples were 0 42 1 3 and 1 9 5 8 respectively as shown in fig 6 these values were similar to the values after 20 min 140 min and 1 d of soaking 0 13 2 and 0 81 6 6 for cn and bl litter found by sakuma et al 2020 in a leaching test using litter samples after a litter bag experiment at a point close to where our litter samples were collected 137cs was leached more readily from the bl litter than the cn litter the leaching rates for both litter samples were highest immediately after soaking started as shown in fig 7 similar results were found in similar experiments performed by kurihara et al 2020 and sakuma et al 2020 even though different solid liquid ratios were used these results indicated that 137cs would be readily released from litter in the riparian area valley and lower parts of the slope when a water channel expands because of the water level rising or rain runoff this would directly affect the 137cs concentration in the river water the cumulative amounts of doc and potassium ions leached after 18 h of soaking were 0 089 0 0033 and 16 0 67 respectively of the total concentrations in the cn litter and 0 12 0 0066 and 20 2 9 respectively of the total concentrations in the bl litter as shown in fig 6 this indicated that doc in litter was much less readily solubilized than 137cs but that potassium ions were more readily solubilized than 137cs however like 137cs doc and potassium ions were leached fastest immediately after soaking started as shown in fig 7 it was therefore appropriate to focus on the behaviors of doc and potassium ions when evaluating the direct contribution of litter leachate to the dissolved radiocesium activity concentration in river water 4 discussion 4 1 effect of leachate from litter on the dissolved radiocesium activity concentration in river water under base flow conditions 4 1 1 direct involvement of litter indicated by the relationship between the radiocesium and doc concentrations the similar litter leaching patterns for 137cs doc and potassium ions indicated that litter leaching was directly related to the significant positive correlations between the dissolved 137cs activity concentration and doc and potassium ion concentrations in river water under base flow conditions shown in table 1 however the temporal changes in the relationships between the dissolved 137cs activity concentration and doc and potassium ion concentrations found through linear mixed model analysis the results of which are shown in table 2 and s1 indicated that doc and potassium ions were related in different ways to changes in the dissolved 137cs activity concentration in the river water doc as has previously been stated nakanishi et al 2014 can be used as an indicator of litter directly supplying dissolved radiocesium to runoff and river water the field lysimeter experiment results found by nakanishi et al 2014 indicated that the potential for 137cs in litter to dissolve decreased over time this supports the conclusion that the slope of the line describing the relationship between the doc concentration and dissolved 137cs activity concentration decreased year by year koarashi et al 2016 found that the downward 137cs flux decreased over time during a 4 a study and suggested that the amount of mobile 137cs in litter will decrease over time because the total amount of 137cs in the litter will decrease over time this conclusion was supported by manaka et al 2019 who found that the proportion of exchangeable 137cs in organic layer samples decreased markedly 2 4 a after the fdnpp accident and had become almost constant at 2 4 of total 137cs at the end of the study an annual soil survey in the study area indicated that the 137cs activity concentrations in the l and fh litter layers decreased over time and the concentrations in 2017 were less than half the concentrations in 2014 in both cn and bl forests takechi et al 2021 the decreases in the 137cs concentration in litter supported our conclusion that the potential for radiocesium in litter in the study area dissolving decreased over time 4 1 2 indirect involvement of litter indicated by the relationship between the radiocesium and potassium ion concentrations the small annual changes in the slope of the line describing the relationship between the dissolved 137cs and potassium ion concentrations indicated that unlike doc potassium ions played roles in addition to being useful for indicating the solubilization of radiocesium in litter the data indicated that the presence of potassium ions increased the radiocesium concentration in the study river and therefore that potassium ions were directly involved in radiocesium dissolution in other words potassium ions caused radiocesium to desorb from the solid phase of soil this would have occurred through potassium ions causing the selective desorption of radiocesium from clay particles in soil and sediment the soil and sediment in the fukushima area contain large proportions of clay particles which have many fess konoplev et al 2016 yamaguchi et al 2017 most exchangeable 137cs in soil and sediment in the study area would have been retained by fess tachi et al 2020 weakly hydrated potassium ions can selectively exchange with radiocesium attached to fess fuller et al 2014 wauters et al 1994 so can facilitate the solubilization of 137cs in soil and sediment murota et al 2016 found that 40 of the total amount of 137cs in a soil sample from around the fdnpp was desorbed by soaking the soil in a solution containing potassium chloride at a relatively low concentration 10 5 m k 0 39 mg l for a long period 139 d the potassium ion concentrations in the study river under base flow conditions throughout the year were 0 28 0 56 mg l but the concentrations tended to be higher in summer than at other times of the year the ss concentrations in the study river under base flow conditions were usually 1 mg l as shown in fig 2 this suggested that contact between potassium ions and river sediment or riverbank soil caused 137cs to become desorbed it has been found that 137cs fixation aging onto clay particles occurs more slowly in river sediment and riverbank soil because of the consistently wet conditions than in soil on a slope which repeatedly cycles between being wet and dry roig et al 2007 a lack of aging would mean the amount of exchangeable 137cs attached to fess and regular exchange sites would not decrease very much over time and that exchange with potassium ions the concentration of which remains stable over time would not markedly vary this may explain the lack of a clear temporal decrease in the slope describing the relationship between the 137cs and potassium ion concentrations however if there is a decline in total 137cs activity concentrations in river sediment and riverbank soil or if aging proceeds gradually in the future the slope will become more gentle the intercept of the regression line decreased markedly over time and this was confirmed by the linear mixed model analysis results table 2 a decrease in the ability of litter to supply 137cs may have contributed to this although more detailed analysis using a larger dataset will be required to reach a firm conclusion 4 1 3 mechanisms controlling the concentration of dissolved radiocesium in litter leachate and the effect on the radiocesium concentration in the forest river under base flow conditions groundwater runoff will be dominant most of the time under base flow conditions so contact between litter and river water will be limited to the river bed or near the river channel where the litter has accumulated increased microbial activity in summer because of higher temperatures will promote the leaching of potassium ions and radiocesium from accumulated litter on the river bed or near the river channel which will increase the dissolved radiocesium activity concentration by allowing radiocesium to be leached from the litter and by causing radiocesium to be supplied by river sediment through selective exchange with potassium ions the flow of a river under base flow conditions in summer will fluctuate because of the humid and rainy climate of the asian monsoon area ohte et al 2010 fluctuations in the river flow conditions will increase the chance and time of contact between the litter accumulated near the river channel and river water which will promote the supply of dissolved radiocesium and potassium ions the 137cs activity concentration in the litter decreased over time as indicated by the linear mixed model analysis results shown in table 2 so we concluded that the dissolved 137cs activity concentration in river water was more strongly affected by indirect contributions from potassium leached from the litter than direct leaching from litter under base flow conditions a future task would be to determine how to quantitatively estimate the ratio of the two contributions 4 2 effects of litter on the dissolved 137cs activity concentration in river water during rain runoff events 4 2 1 effects of litter leachate on direct runoff processes the flow rate of a river in a forested area will increase during a rain even because of direct runoff consisting of surface flow and subsurface flow on the nearby slopes direct runoff will therefore strongly affect the water quality in a river during a rain runoff event the slopes of the lines describing the relationship between the dissolved 137cs activity concentration and doc concentration were markedly lower during the rain events than under base flow conditions as shown in fig 5a this would mainly have been caused by constituents of the pore water in the surface soil layer being released and transported in flowing subsurface water as shown in table s2 regardless of the species of trees present pore water in surface soil to 20 cm deep in the riverine area or on the slopes generally contained doc at a higher concentration 8 7 17 mg l than the concentration in river water during a rain runoff event the increases in the doc concentrations in the river water during the rain runoff events were concluded to have been caused by influxes of substances leached from litter by rainfall and surface flow and substances released from soil pore water this conclusion was supported by the constant b values representing the load discharge relationship for doc being 1 0 during all the three rainfall events table 3 in a previous study the increases in the concentrations of biologically active constituents as the flow rate increased were attributed to leaching of the constituents from the organic soil horizons during periods of high flow rates walling and webb 1986 the dissolved 137cs activity concentrations in the soil pore water samples were all below the detection limit 0 55 bq l and were much lower than the concentrations in the solution after litter had been immersed in water for 10 min in the batch tests 12 4 1 and 46 4 9 bq l for the cn and bl areas respectively so mixing with soil pore water probably decreased the slope of the regression line for the dissolved 137cs activity and doc concentrations relative to the slope found under base flow conditions however as shown in fig 5a significant positive correlations between the doc and dissolved 137cs concentrations were found throughout the study indicating that substances leached from the litter were the dominant contributors to the concentrations in the river water during the runoff events the same conclusion was drawn from the relationship between the 137cs and potassium ion concentrations unlike the doc concentration the potassium ion concentration in the river water did not clearly increase during each rain runoff event because of the influx of litter leachate and soil pore water as shown in fig 5b this would have been because the potassium ion concentration in pore water in soil 20 cm deep 1 3 2 1 and 1 8 2 2 mg l for the cn and bl areas respectively as shown in table s2 was lower than the concentration in the river water however the potassium ion and dissolved 137cs concentrations significantly positively correlated supporting the conclusion that litter leachate directly contributed to the dissolved 137cs activity concentration in the river water during each runoff event the results for the water samples from the depleted gully that became a runoff channel only during the rain runoff events suggested that the water quality of the direct runoff was strongly affected by litter leachate the slopes of the lines describing the relationships between the dissolved 137cs activity concentration and doc and potassium ion concentrations were larger than the slopes of the lines describing the relationships in the river water during runoff events as shown in fig 5a and b the increase in the potassium ion concentration caused by potassium ions being leached from litter may have led to desorption of selectively adsorbed 137cs on clay particles in ss and river sediment like under base flow conditions however the 137cs desorption process has been found to be slow rather than instantaneous at the potassium ion concentrations we found liu et al 2003 murota et al 2016 sakuma et al 2019 found that even taking the effects of competing ions potassium and ammonium ions into consideration in a physically based numerical runoff model for the ota river catchment and decreasing the distribution coefficient 137cs kd from 2 105 to 5 104 l kg the increase in the dissolved 137cs activity concentration during a runoff event relative to the 137cs activity concentration under base flow conditions just before the event could not be reproduced but rather the concentration decreased these results indicated that desorption of 137cs caused by potassium ions did not strongly affect the dissolved 137cs concentration in river water during the runoff unsteady events during this study 4 2 2 mechanism involved in maintaining a high dissolved 137cs activity concentration under high flow conditions temporal changes in river channels occur particularly during runoff events caused by heavy rain in other words the river channel network expands meaning the direct runoff source area increases this greatly increases the likelihood of litter leachate directly flowing into the river this will probably cause a high dissolved 137cs concentration in the river water to be maintained during a runoff event expansion of the source area was also suggested from the relationship between the 137cs concentration in river water and the amount of 137cs discharged the dissolved 137cs activity concentration and potassium ion concentration were little affected by fluctuations in discharges in any of the runoff events as indicated by the constant b values shown in table 3 the simplest mechanisms for maintaining the concentration of a chemical as the amount of chemical discharged increases are the reactive surface area increasing and the reaction rate increasing godsey et al 2009 the batch experiment data clearly indicated that the amount of 137cs leached from the litter decreased as the soaking time increased it was therefore reasonable to conclude that the increase in the area contributing direct runoff strongly contributed to the 137cs activity concentration in the river water being maintained the almost instantaneous leaching of 137cs from litter although not as fast as leaching of potassium ions particularly bl litter during a runoff event as shown in fig 6 would have increased the supply of 137cs to the mainstream of the river as the source area expanded this conclusion was supported by the amounts of 137cs that could be leached from litter in the areas contributing to direct runoff being much larger than the total amount of dissolved 137cs in runoff during each rainfall event the estimated area of the valley that could have contributed to direct runoff was 3 2 km2 this was calculated from the topographic position index weiss 2001 using a moving window average of 20 cells and the topographic landform definition for a valley 1 0 standard deviation weiss 2001 these calculations were performed using the digital elevation model with a spatial resolution of 5 m geospatial information authority of japan 2012 and the arcgis 10 1 topography tools dilts 2015 in arcgis 10 3 software the estimated total amount of 137cs retained by the litter layer in the valley area was 5 5 105 mbq which was equivalent to 0 17 mbq m2 this was calculated by multiplying the total amount of 137cs deposited in the valley determined from the results of the third airborne monitoring study ministry of education culture sports science and technology 2011 by the proportion of deposited 137cs retained in the litter layer a retention ratio of 10 was used because that ratio was found in previous surveys imamura et al 2017 takahashi et al 2019 and in surveys of the study area the 137cs leaching potential for litter deposited in the valley was calculated by multiplying the estimated retention time in the litter layer by the cumulative leaching fraction determined in the litter batch tests fig 6 it is difficult to accurately estimate the time that litter in the field is soaked i e the litter leaching duration because of rainfall infiltration and surface flow so the cumulative leaching rates for litter in areas containing cn and bl trees were assumed to be 0 7 and 6 0 respectively the time from the flow increasing because of rainfall to the maximum flow rate 3 5 4 8 h for the three events was used as the leaching duration the estimated 137cs leaching potential for the litter in the valley calculated using the conditions described above was 3 9 103 mbq when all of the litter was from cn trees and 3 3 104 mbq when all of the litter was from bl trees these values were much higher than the total amount of dissolved 137cs in runoff during the three direct runoff events 420 600 mbq decay corrected to 2 july 2011 the third airborne monitoring day after the fdnpp accident this supported the conclusion that litter affected the dissolved 137cs activity concentration in the river water during the runoff events because the direct runoff area expanded during the rainfall events the results for the three runoff events caused by typhoons that struck the study area within about 2 weeks indicated that the dissolved 137cs activity concentration did not increase to the same degree in every runoff event even though direct runoff would have caused 137cs to be leached from the litter the potential for 137cs to be leached from litter was so much higher in the first storm event than the subsequent two events that the dissolved 137cs concentration in the river water increased markedly only during the first event sakuma et al 2020 soaked cedar and hardwood litter that had been used in degradation tests in litterbags and found that the potential for 137cs to be leached from the litter was affected by the degree of litter decomposition that had occurred which in the field will depend on the air temperature during the preceding dry period they also found that the potential for 137cs to be leached was decreased by prior precipitation three typhoons in a row struck the study area during the study period in summer when litter would have been decomposing faster than at other times of year the relatively dry period 7 d before the first typhoon would have allowed a relatively large amount of 137cs to become available for leaching however the leaching potential may also have increased during the dry periods before the second and third rainfall events but we concluded that the brevity of each of these dry periods and wash off that occurred in the preceding rainfall events explained the dissolved 137cs activity concentration in the river water not markedly increasing during the second and third runoff events the constant a values determined by fitting a line to the relationship between load and discharge a values 0 40 0 26 and 0 26 for the first second and third events respectively as shown in table 3 reflected the differences between the leaching potentials for the first and subsequent events we concluded that an increase in the dissolved radiocesium concentration in a river in a forested area during a rain runoff event would require both direct runoff to deliver litter leachate to the river and microbial degradation to have made radiocesium able to be leached little decontamination has been performed in the forest area so it is expected that dissolved radiocesium will continue to be released from litter in the future however the radiocesium content of forest litter tends to decrease over time by more than the decrease caused by natural decay as mentioned above so the leaching potential will also decrease over time the amount of dissolved radiocesium in runoff from a terrestrial area will therefore continue to decrease over time and the degree to which a rainfall event will increase the concentration of dissolved radiocesium in river water will decrease 5 conclusions the results of the water quality surveys under base flow conditions for 4 years and runoff observations during extremely intense rainfall events in the forested area strongly affected by the fdnpp accident led us to make the conclusions shown below 1 the dissolved 137cs activity concentration decreased over time but had a temporal cycle with a maximum in summer the dissolved 137cs activity concentration significantly correlated with the doc and potassium ion concentrations for each year and the entire period 2 the slope of the line describing the relationship between the dissolved 137cs activity concentration and doc concentration under base flow conditions decreased each year but the slope of the line describing the relationship between the dissolved 137cs activity concentration and the potassium ion concentration did not markedly change this suggested that the dissolved 137cs activity concentration was increased more by indirect contributions of 137cs desorbed from river sediment and riparian soil by potassium ions leached from litter than by direct contributions of 137cs leached from litter 3 during each runoff event that occurred in a short period during the study the dissolved 137cs activity concentration was higher when maximum runoff occurred than at the beginning of the runoff event however the maximum dissolved 137cs activity concentrations were lower during the second and third events than the first event 4 during the runoff events positive correlations between the dissolved 137cs activity concentration and the doc and potassium ion concentrations strongly suggested that direct contributions of substances leached from litter were important and that direct runoff was mainly responsible for the increases in dissolved 137cs doc and potassium ion concentrations in the river water however a clear increase in the dissolved 137cs concentration was found to require an increase in the 137cs leaching potential caused by microbial degradation during the preceding dry period and the effects of direct runoff credit authorship contribution statement seiji hayashi

7984,the region studied is the 137 000 km2 north china plain ncp a region with high population density and a major agricultural production leading to unsustainable exploitation of groundwater resources previous modeling studies in the region have utilized simplified representations of model boundary fluxes both regarding lateral inflows from surface and groundwater and related to water demands and consumptions the current study focusses on developing a hydrological modeling framework with better spatial descriptions of major water balance components regarding water demands model boundary conditions of surface and groundwater inflows and evaporative losses due to irrigation compared to previous efforts the modeling framework utilizes a novel multi objective parameter optimization strategy combined with an ensemble modeling approach to illuminate optimization trade offs and impacts of parameter uncertainty groundwater storage declines are estimated to be in the order of 25 55 mm y for the period 2000 2013 the impacts of water management strategies are explored using the model ensemble and show that this decline can be counterbalanced by approximately 15 20 mm y by substantial reductions in irrigation 20 or implementation of planned inter basin water transfers managed aquifer recharge in the form of infiltrating excess river peak flows can only reduce groundwater storage declines to a limited degree however at the local to regional scale storage decline reductions from mar are in the same order of magnitude as other extensive water management

been experiencing groundwater overdraft driven by human consumption taylor et al 2013 the overdraft is a result of a rapid industrialization and population growth combined with extensive irrigation based agriculture huang et al 2015 pan et al 2017 the high water demand has over the past decades resulted in declining groundwater tables across the entire ncp as observed by both in situ and satellite based gravimetrical observations shen et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 some of the cascading effects from the declining groundwater tables are land subsidence drying riverbeds deterioration of water quality and a need for deeper wells zheng et al 2010 the emergence of these effects has caused the government of the people s republic of china to put the problem of water scarcity and quality high on the political agenda thus a stringent management of the water resources in china has been put forward in recent policies to minimize the gap between water supply and demand ambitious political goals of capping water demand increasing water use efficiency and improving water quality in the regions of china with major water problems has been formalized in policy documents such as the no 1 policy document ministry of agriculture of the people s republic of china 2010 three red lines global water partnership 2015 and the water ten plan the state council the people s republic of china 2015 the goal of reducing groundwater overdraft in haihe river basin is clear but the solutions are manifold so far an emphasis has been put on large scale inter basin transfer projects as the south to north water transfer snwt project but such cost intensive engineering solutions cannot stand alone in solving the water scarcity issues of the ncp jiang 2015 increasing attention has been given to alternative storage solutions such as managed aquifer recharge mar mar is a well known technology where aquifer storage capacity is utilized to actively store various excess water resources in the subsurface dillon et al 2019 in contrast to spontaneous incidental aquifer recharge mar is a way to optimize the water resources management in areas with depleted or unreliable groundwater aquifer storage mar does not create new water resources but with local water sources a natural underground storage with benefits such as limited evaporation increased baseflow and resilience towards aquifer storage depletion can potentially alleviate water scarcity the technology is widespread across the world but is still fairly immature in china zheng et al 2016 in 2019 the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china mwrprc issued the comprehensive recovery and regulation plan of groundwater exploitation in north china district ÂçéÂåóÂú∞Âå∫Âú∞‰∏ãÊ∞¥Ë∂ÖÈááÁªºÂêàÊ≤ªÁêÜÊñπÊ°à from hereon abbreviated as the ncd groundwater plan the plan consists of goals for 2022 and 2035 focusing on fully utilizing the snwt capacity as well as managed groundwater recharge in presently dried out riverbeds with such a paradigm shift from incidental aquifer recharge to mar groundwater recharge can be managed in a way that benefits socio economic environmental and supply enhancement objectives several studies have investigated the effect of overexploitation of the groundwater resource in the ncp these studies use both in situ observations of groundwater level decline large scale storage change estimates from gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data and groundwater modeling among the observationally based studies shen et al 2015 estimated a 17 mm y groundwater storage decline for the entire haihe river basin using both in situ water level observations and grace observations for the period 2003 2012 since drawdown in the haihe river basin mainly occurs in the ncp the corresponding number for ncp would be considerably higher such observation based estimates are indispensable in the documentation and communication of the severe consequences of groundwater overdraft however these observations typically represent either a very small scale well observations or a very large footprint without spatial detail or encompassing more than the ncp alone grace in addition the observation based monitoring does not allow for scenario testing such as climate change projection or water management groundwater modeling can potentially fill both the spatial scale gap and enable scenario testing and thereby serve as decision support on how to reach good water management alternatives previous studies have modeled the entire groundwater system of the ncp cao et al 2013 developed a regional groundwater model calibrating spatio temporal groundwater recharge in order to evaluate groundwater storage declines in time 1970 2008 obtaining an estimated 17 60 mm y in storage decline qin et al 2013 added to the understanding of the groundwater dynamics of the ncp by calibrating a distributed surface water groundwater model to observed groundwater head time series to calculate the water balance components and test water management scenarios they estimated a 55 mm y storage decline for the period 2000 2008 in the highly engineered and complex water system of haihe river basin hydrological modeling must consider both major water infrastructure projects and a dominating human consumption with the past and ongoing groundwater overdraft on the ncp scenario analysis on future water management has been a focus of multiple studies more recently qin et al 2019 focused on regional water balance impacts from future water management scenarios in a coupled hydrological and system dynamic model adding effects of future climate change on the smaller scale long et al 2020 used a multi objective calibrated hydrological model to evaluate the impact of future snwt allocation to beijing in combination with climate change scenarios studies evaluating the effect of mar as a water management option on the ncp has been carried out in small regional studies e g hao et al 2014 rong et al 2017 or as crude contributions to the overall groundwater balance of the ncp cao et al 2013 to our knowledge no distributed modeling studies evaluating the potential of large scale implementation of mar on the ncp has been carried out in relation to previous large scale groundwater modeling studies of the ncp two modeling aspects have been simplified and should be investigated further the first is the better representation of model boundary fluxes both lateral boundaries and the second are detailed spatially distributed demands and consumptions we hypothesize that by improving these model inputs the uncertainty on predicted storage changes can be reduced lastly a better acknowledgement of model uncertainty especially related to model parameterization can help quantify uncertainties we address the model boundary flux issues by incorporating lateral boundary fluxes for both surface and groundwater from a larger scale hydrological model of the entire haihe river basin and by specifying spatio temporal irrigation consumption data at the model grid scale obtained from remote sensing data koch et al 2020 in addition we utilize national sector specific data on water demands and inter basin water transfers and distribute these according to source proximity and population density the model parameter uncertainty is addressed through a calibration framework based on multiple objectives of groundwater head amplitudes trends and bias spatial patterns of evapotranspiration and river discharge the applied pareto achieving parameter optimization approach using multiple objective functions swayne and hrebicek 2007 enables the selection of an ensemble of parameter sets from a five dimensional pareto front the selected model ensemble is subsequently utilized in an assessment of water management scenarios including a first estimate of large scale mar implementation in the ncp the mar scenarios based on managed recharge of surface water peak flow from the taihang and yan mountains are benchmarked against both a baseline scenario and water management scenarios related to the snwt and irrigation 2 methods 2 1 study site description the model region is located in the north china plain often referred to as the food basket of china it covers megacities as beijing and tianjin as well as parts of the provinces hebei henan and shandong amounting to a total area of 137 200 km2 the agricultural intensive plain area of the ncp model region is bordered by the taihang and yan mountains to the west and north respectively which altogether makes up the haihe river basin the yellow river defines the southern border of the model region where it flows to the bohai sea through its lower reaches fig 1 outlines the haihe river basin and the ncp model region the area is dominated by a continental semi arid climate with a distinct rainy season during the months june september accounting for 70 85 of the 475 mm yearly precipitation 2002 2016 koch et al 2020 agricultural land covers 80 of the area koch et al 2020 which is dominated by a double cropping system where summer maize is grown june september in rotation with winter wheat grown october june zhang et al 2011 approximately 70 of the annual water supply goes into the agricultural sector national bureau of statistics of china 2017a with a discrepancy between timing in peak irrigation demands for winter wheat in may and the start of the rainy season in june human consumption has been identified as a cause for the over exploitation of the groundwater resources of the region rodell et al 2018 and especially agricultural irrigation and industrial water are key drivers for water use in china zhou et al 2020 surface water made up approximately 30 of the regions water supply 2000 2013 national bureau of statistics of china 2017a and natural runoff from the taihang and yan mountains are regulated by major surface water reservoirs at the fringe of the model region over the same period groundwater covered approximately 65 of the water supply an approach to close the demand supply gap has been the construction of the major snwt water infrastructure project from 2014 the snwt middle route was fully operational all the way to beijing and has since allocated up to 4 5 km3 yearly to beijing tianjin and hebei provinces from the sources in the yangtze river basin 2 2 the hydrological model the hydrological model was set up using the mike she modeling software mike she provides a deterministic distributed physically based model set up where the hydrological processes of saturated flow overland flow and channel flow are simulated using the finite differences method unsaturated flow and evapotranspiration was simulated by a simplified 2 layer uz et model for the unsaturated zone compartment of the model dhi 2017a the model domain was discretized into a 1 1km grid and computed with a time step interval of 1 day channel flow was simulated using the mike hydro river modeling package solving the saint venant flow equations for hydrodynamic river network modeling dhi 2017b 2 2 1 conceptual model setup a conceptual illustration of the major water balance components of the ncp model can be seen in fig 2 lateral groundwater recharge natural surface water inflow from the upstream mountainous regions as well as precipitation and irrigation are inputs to the ncp groundwater model distributed total water demands are calculated separately for irrigation urban uwd industrial iwd and ecological water demands ewd which are all withdrawn from the saturated zone surface water bodies in the area are highly regulated with dikes and reservoirs and most river stretches are known to run dry hence a part of the surface water inflow will recharge the saturated zone and thus be available for subsequent groundwater pumping effectively as river bank infiltration this partitioning is controlled by a calibrated leakage coefficient the inter basin transfers yellow river and snwt imported to the model region are deducted from the full water demands groundwater and surface water boundaries as well as the irrigation input to the model are based on the hydrological modeling work of the haihe river basin published by koch et al 2020 run with the same climate forcing data used in the model setup of this study these model boundary estimates are explained in more detail in later sections fig 1 shows the areal extent of the haihe river basin model the major river inflows to the ncp model region as well as adjacent areas dominated by groundwater recharge resulting in a lateral groundwater flux to the ncp model boundaries the model irrigation input is based on a dual modeling approach using satellite estimates and a hydrological model to produce spatially distributed estimates of net irrigation at monthly time steps for the haihe river basin from a study by koch et al 2020 net irrigation corresponds to the water used for irrigation that ultimately leaves the land surface through et the net irrigation was used in two terms of model inputs 1 as an addition to natural precipitation in order to match the observed et patterns in the subsequent model calibration 2 as a part of the distributed groundwater pumping for irrigation multiplied a return flow correction factor to represent the full applied irrigation descriptions of the hydrological model input data boundary flows numerical calculations of each component in the water balance including the irrigation return flow factor can be found in the subsequent sections see also tables 1 and 2 for details 2 2 2 model input data for this study the mswep v2 beck et al 2019 data was used as precipitation forcing data the potential evapotranspiration forcing data was calculated by koch et al 2020 with the pyeto package in python based on the fao 56 penman monteith method allen et al 1998 based on era interim data provided by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf both forcing data sets were processed to a 10 10km spatial resolution and a temporal resolution of daily time steps in the model setup the main drivers for computing actual evapotranspiration are the meteorological data and vegetation properties in the simplified 2 layer uz et model actual evapotranspiration is based on potential et and vegetation properties according to the fao guidelines allen et al 1998 vegetation properties used in the model setup to determine actual et are leaf area index lai crop coefficient kc and root depth rd kc and rd were regionalized based on the following equations with a spatio temporally varying lai input 1 k c t k c min k c diff 1 e a kc la i t 2 r d t r d min r d max la i min la i max la i t la i min r d min the modis mcd15a2h 006 product was used to acquire data on lai and was processed to monthly time steps at 1 km resolution laimin and laimax were fixed at 0 1 and 3 respectively kc min kc diff akc rdmin and rdmax were calibration parameters the 2 layer unsaturated zone module was parameterized based on the spatially distributed soil property data set of sand silt clay and bulk density from the harmonized world soil database v 1 2 by food and agriculture organization fao fischer et al 2019 a weighted average of the four soil properties over the depth of the soil profile was re calculated into a 1 1km grid by using the python sci kit learn package the resulting soil classes were re classified into 37 new soil classes with the k means clustering algorithm based on the depth averaged soil properties hydraulic properties of hydrological conductivity as well as saturation field capacity and wilting point soil moisture for these 37 soil classes were found using the neural network algorithm of the rosetta module in the hydrus software ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2008 and from the van genuchten equation van genuchten 1980 the resulting 37 classes of hydrological properties were again re classified using k means into a total of 10 classes based on their hydrogeological properties the saturated zone of the model consisted of a multi layered heterogeneous and anisotropic representation of the subsurface geology each geological unit was delineated based on the dominating hydrogeological features of the subsurface in the region this study adopted the conceptual understanding of the subsurface geology represented by a shallow aquifer and two deeper confined aquifers from previous conceptualizations of the groundwater aquifer system proposed by cao et al 2013 and qin et al 2013 the deepest sections of the shallow and deep aquifer systems were 220 and 560 mbsl respectively the shallow and deep aquifers were delineated into six and five geological sub units respectively based on maps of hydrogeological features produced by the china geological survey boundary conditions were parted into coastline and the boundaries on land lateral groundwater flow to the piedmont region of the shallow aquifer were found from the distributed groundwater recharge estimated by a regional hydrological model of the haihe river basin fig 1 koch et al 2020 this regional model was setup in the mhm model code samaniego et al 2010 and the model was run with the same climate forcing data as used for this study and calibrated against remotely sensed evapotranspiration and river discharge koch et al 2020 recharge areas were delineated based on watershed delineation of minor rivers and channels along the fringe of the piedmont area resulting in six recharge areas sloping towards piedmont region of the model with a maximum distance from the model boundary of 130 km fig 1 inflows from the larger upstream rivers are dominated by the surface water component and not included in the lateral groundwater inflow boundaries based on the groundwater recharge estimates and recharge source areas time series of daily lateral groundwater flux along the six sections of the piedmont fringe could be estimated lateral groundwater recharge was implemented as boundary flux to the shallow aquifer only a lateral groundwater inflow of 1 26 km3 year for the whole ncp model domain was estimated over the period 1996 2005 this corresponds well to previous findings ranging from 1 to 2 km3 year cao et al 2013 the shallow aquifer coastline had a fixed head boundary whereas the boundary condition along the yellow river was set to no flow for the deep aquifer layers the boundary conditions were set to no flow in the entire domain the model river network outlined in fig 1 represents the major river systems in the haihe river basin upstream inflow boundaries were based on modeling results from the regional scale haihe river basin hydrological model koch et al 2020 all of the rivers are heavily regulated by dam operations at their inlet to the ncp model domain most rivers experience substantial surface water depletion on their path through the ncp this was simulated with a leakage coefficient calibrated against observed outflow to the bohai gulf to the east resulting upstream river inflow boundaries accounts for 4 4 km3 year on average over the period 1996 2005 as a comparison in the period 2000 2005 approximately 1 5 km3 year reached the bohai sea from the haihe river basin according to haihe river water conservancy commission 2016 2 2 3 water abstractions official data on water use in the model region is highly aggregated with the smallest scale being prefecture city level and irrigation estimates are even more difficult to obtain distributed water demands of the model were therefore calculated from remote sensing based data sets major cones of depression have been documented near the big cities within the region as well as in the irrigation intensive areas e g feng et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 supporting the assumption of the water demand being closely related to the population density and irrigation demand distribution in the region population density maps were used to correlate aggregated provincial statistics on water demand to a spatially distributed water demand estimate irrigation demands were as already mentioned based on dual modeling relying on remote sensing data sets and estimated in a previous study by koch et al 2020 the water infrastructure of the haihe river basin is highly engineered allowing for transfers of surface water sources as well as inter basin transfers around the basin in the calculation of a distributed water demand estimate inter basin transfers are deducted from the full water demand estimate as a function of distance from the water infrastructure importing the water transfers the result is a fully distributed water abstraction data set correlated with the region population density and influenced by its vicinity to surface and inter basin water sources the following sections will elaborate further on the methodology 2 2 3 1 irrigation demand a substantial amount of water from the yellow river is diverted for agricultural use in henan shandong and hebei province ranging from 6 to 11 km3 year during 1998 2016 according to the yellow river conservancy commission 2020 from the lower reaches of the yellow river major diversion channels exist into all three provinces again data of yellow river diversions is not publicly available at a resolution higher than province level to account for surface water irrigation in the distributed irrigation product a proximity optimization algorithm was developed based on linear programming using the docplex package in python the algorithm reduced groundwater based irrigation in each cell of the model domain as a function of vicinity to the yellow river constrained by yearly time series of yellow river diversions to mimic that irrigation is sustained by yellow river water rather than groundwater min c x 3 s t t 1 t n 1 n irr n t x n t q y r t t 1 t n 1 n 1 f n n 1 x n x n 1 0 x n 1 where c is a cost vector with equal costs of 1 for all irrigation demand decision variables x sorted according to their proximity to the yellow river n is the number of model cells within 100 km proximity from the yellow river t is the number of model time steps irr is the irrigation qyr is the time series of area weighted average of diversions to agriculture in hebei shandong and henan province and f is a relative yellow river proximity factor between xn and xn 1 representing the relative proximity of model cells to the river in order to correlate the net irrigation estimate from koch et al 2020 with irrigation groundwater pumping in the model setup a return flow factor was calculated a model setup with a well performing parametrization was run with net irrigation as the groundwater pumping for irrigation both with and without the net irrigation added to the precipitation input a pumping correction factor firr was calculated which increased groundwater pumping to match a zero change in long term groundwater storage between the two model setups the resulting return flow correction factor firr of 1 34 corresponding to a return flow fraction of 34 was multiplied to the distributed irrigation data and implemented as groundwater pumping for irrigation 2 2 3 2 urban industrial and ecological water demands in addition to irrigation water demands the model region is densely populated with an average population density of 550 people km2 national bureau of statistics of china 2017b distributed water demands were estimated from water supply statistics and population density data publicly available statistics on urban industrial and ecological water supply are available from the china statistical yearbook published by the national bureau of statistics of china 2017 reported on province level at a yearly basis per capita water supply time series from 1998 to 2016 for each of the three aforementioned sectors were found from statistics as an area weighted average of the five provinces beijing tianjin hebei henan and shandong covered by the model region groundwater pumping times series were based on yearly province water supply statistics corrected for the inter basin yellow river and snwt water transfer allocations losses re circulation and re infiltration of supplied water is accounted for by using sector specific consumption rates provided by the hai river water conservancy commission the inter basin transfers were assumed allocated to each sector proportionally to their relative supply eq 4 exemplify the calculation of the domestic water demand 4 dem dom cap t f rc dom i 1 i f a i ws dom i

each sector and is 0 5 0 5 and 0 8 for domestic industrial and ecological use respectively based on 2009 2016 statistics in the haihe river water conservancy commission 2016 water resources bulletins in each sector these fractions will not return to the local water cycle and is considered a consumptive demand per capita water demand statistics were estimated separately for beijing and tianjin provinces while the rest of the model domain was represented by an area weighted per capita water demand of the provinces hebei shandong and henan per capita water demand estimates were based on the landscan high resolution global population data set bright et al 2017 from 2000 to 2016 which was also used to create the distributed population density correlated groundwater pumping map water demands were implemented in the model with a 4 4 km resolution resulting long term averages of groundwater pumping time series for domestic industrial ecological and irrigation water demand can be seen in fig 3 2 3 calibration method the model was calibrated with a split sample approach covering the period 1996 2008 the 1996 2000 input data set was used as a calibration spin up period and the model performance was evaluated for the 2000 2005 calibration period a final model validation was performed on the 2006 2008 period data used for calibration and validation were observed groundwater heads satellite based evapotranspiration and river outflow statistics groundwater head observations covered the period 2000 2008 qin et al 2013 from a total of 201 wells 141 in the shallow aquifer unit and 60 wells in the deep aquifers fig 1 actual evapotranspiration were evaluated against long term means of satellite based evapotranspiration using the pt jpl thermal model 2002 2016 koch et al 2020 the river leakage from 12 major natural river stretches in the luanhe chaobaihe yongdinghe daqinghe ziyahe and zhangweihe river systems were calibrated against average yearly statistics of river to sea flow fractions 2000 2005 from the haihe river water conservancy commission 2016 calibration was performed with the model independent ostrich optimization software matott 2017 using the parapadds search algorithm swayne and hrebicek 2007 parapadds is a parallelized multi objective dynamically dimension search dds tolson and shoemaker 2007 algorithm that identifies a pareto front of non dominated optimal solutions which is useful for multi criteria calibration the parapadds algorithm was run with the user settings of maximum 800 iteration a 0 2 perturbation value and the exacthypervolumecontribution as the selection metric in this study a total of five objective functions of were used for the model calibration within three overall data categories of evapotranspiration

horizontal hydraulic conductivity while a uniform anisotropy factor was shared for all geological units with the exception of a single geounit with large groundwater drawdowns specific storage and specific yields for each geological unit were tied in two categories for geological units in the shallow and deep aquifers respectively parameters for calculating distributed root depth and crop coefficients were also included as calibration parameters along with a leakage factor for river network surface water groundwater interactions 2 4 water management scenarios the calibrated model was used to explore scenarios for future water management on the ncp compared to a business as usual baseline the scenarios were developed in collaboration with water experts in china from southern university of science and technology sustech university of jinan and institute of hydropower beijing water science and technology institute and water resources research iwhr whom have a close connection to the water resources management sector in haihe river basin with an onset in the political plan comprehensive recovery and regulation plan of groundwater exploitation in north china district ncd groundwater plan issued by the mwrprc three overarching scenarios with a total of eight sub scenarios for future water management were outlined the scenarios concerned three different aspects of water management re allocation of water resources using mar supply augmentation from the snwt middle route and demand reduction of agricultural irrigation the model implementation of the baseline and three water management scenarios are described below 2 4 1 baseline scenario the baseline scenario was run for the 14 year reference period 2000 2013 representing a wide range of climatic and hydrological conditions model inputs of water demands river boundaries climatic data etc covered the full reference period in total 15 sets of model parameterizations sampled from the ostrich parapadds non dominated solutions were run for the baseline scenario reflecting a range of diverse but equally plausible model parameterizations the same sub set of 15 model parameterizations were used in all water management scenarios 2 4 2 mar scenario the mar scenarios in the current study utilized peak flood water for riverbed infiltration in the selected infiltration zones in the piedmont region fig 1 peak flows of natural runoff exceeding the 85th percentile for each of the river boundary inflow time series were assumed to be flood water suitable and applicable for mar similar to the 80 90th percentile approach suggested by alam et al 2020 and kocis and dahlke 2017 for the central valley in california for the reference period 2000 2013 these peak flows on average equaled 0 74 km3 year three scenarios utilizing 100 50 and 25 of the total peak flows were simulated to represent various levels of efficiencies capturing the available peak flow for mar mar was implemented in the model by reducing the river inflow boundary monthly runoff time series with the respective peak flow time series resulting in reduced upstream peak inflows to the model domain the corresponding peaks were infiltrated as negative pumping during the four wet months june september in injection wells distributed at a 4 km distance along both sides of the downstream river network passing through the piedmont mar sites outlined in fig 1 2 4 3 snwt scenario snwt middle route allocations as of year 2017 and the goals of increase by year 2035 as stated in the ncd groundwater plan snwt middle route allocations to hebei beijing and tianjin provinces were in total 4 5 km3 in year 2017 and with an increase of 1 2 km3 it is expected to rise to 5 7 km3 in year 2035 snwt are allocated to substitute groundwater pumping for the water demands in the three sectors domestic industrial and ecological the supply augmentation from the snwt middle route is assumed to reduce water consumption within a 100 km buffer zone from the snwt middle route outlined in fig 1 the reduced consumption is calculated as the snwt allocation fraction fsnwt of the total population scaled water demand as presented earlier in fig 3 within the 100 km buffer zone from the snwt middle route water demands of all groundwater pumping wells located within this buffer is recalculated considering also the fraction of consumption frc used to calculate the distributed water demand estimates below is an example recalculating domestic water demand dom within the buffer zone 14 do m snwt dom f rc dom 1 f snwt 2 4 4 irrigation scenario this scenario describes a reduction of irrigation to simulate either increased water use efficiency decreased demand by land use change or a combination of the two the irrigation scenarios are implemented as reduced groundwater pumping for irrigation the distributed estimate of groundwater pumping for irrigation is reduced by 5 10 and 20 the reduction is done after subtracting surface water allocations from the yellow river for irrigation resulting in a less pronounced effect in surface water fed irrigation areas the corresponding reduction in net irrigation is also subtracted the precipitation term including both precipitation and net irrigation 3 results 3 1 model calibration the model calibration based on the five objective functions using the ostrich parapadds optimizer with five parallel model executions lasted 600 hrs on a xeon e5 4620 2 6ghz server the calibration resulted in 298 non dominated solutions forming a five dimensional pareto front 15 model parameterizations were chosen from the 298 non dominated solutions through a two step procedure first a pre screening was performed with a cutoff of 3 standard deviations above the minimum objective function error ofe for each of which will remove solutions that perform very poorly on individual ofs subsequently the ofe of the remaining 171 solutions fig 4a are normalized by their ofe between ofmin and ofmax for each of summing the normalized ofes enables a balanced score across all ofs based on the balance of score the five best balanced solutions are selected along with the two best solutions for each individual of that still fall with the 50 best balanced solutions the selection is a compromise between representing all of s and an ensemble size requiring reasonable computational resources a manageable ensemble size was set at 15 ensemble members five of the 15 ensemble members represented the balanced solutions while two parameter sets from each of the specific of s were included to make up the 15 member ensemble this ensured a selection with most emphasis on a balanced parameter set the selected 15 solutions are displayed in fig 4b this selection secures a representation of each of and enables analysis of the tradeoff between of while also enabling a balanced solution all subsequent results will represent these 15 parameter sets table 3 which are carried forward in model performance evaluation and scenario modeling whereby acknowledging and quantifying effects of model parameter uncertainty model performance on simulated groundwater head for all observation wells is given in fig 5 for both the calibration period and validation period the bias me is 3 80 m 0 79 m for the calibration period and 1 5 m 1 72 m for the validation period rmse s are large at 20 59 m 0 71 m and 21 60 m 0 41 m for calibration and validation respectively the large rmse s are mainly caused by the inability of the model to reproduce some very large observed drawdowns in the coastal region around tianjin south of beijing where observed heads are down to 90 m below sea level simulated and observed groundwater head trends and annual amplitudes are illustrated in fig 6 as means across all shallow and deep wells used for calibration this comparison shows a good overall agreement on the direction of the trends and for the deep wells also on the slope which is important for the model s ability to estimate drawdowns as a result of groundwater consumption and climate variability annual amplitudes are on average greatly underestimated for the shallow wells and also underestimated for the deep wells fig 6 the underestimation of annual amplitudes could owe to a temporal smoothing by delayed groundwater recharge for the shallow aquifer while the amplitudes in the deep aquifer is assumed to be more controlled by a combination of temporal patterns in recharge and abstraction a key element of the model application is the estimation of annual groundwater storage and groundwater head decline both spatially and across the entire ncp the spatial pattern in simulated groundwater head for the deep aquifer for the year 2000 is illustrated in fig 7a showing the expected gradient from high groundwater levels along the mountain range boundary in the south and west towards lower values at the bohai sea region and drawdowns around tianjin fig 7b displays the simulated groundwater head change drawdown for the period 2000 2013 here the influence of the major urban centers at beijing tianjin and shijiazhuang is visible with general head declines in the order of 15 25 m over 14 years for the agriculturally dominated piedmont plain where irrigation is the main consumer of groundwater the decline is typically 2 7 m over 14 years with an average for the entire model area of 4 2 m 0 3 mm year for the deep aquifer in addition to groundwater level changes which are a combination of storage change and aquifer properties the groundwater storage change itself expressed in mm year is the common metric for volumetric water deficits the simulated groundwater storage decline 2000 2013 expressed in mm year for the entire ncp and all modeled aquifers is 50 15 mm year when averaged for all 15 parameter sets however fig 8 reveals that there is a substantial spread in this estimate among the different solution depending on which objective function the parameter set was selected to favor the five balanced solutions dominate the average estimate representing 5 of 15 solutions and therefore results in a similar value of 55 mm year while the gwbias and gwtrend of s are lower at around 25 33 mm the gwamp and spaef are around 50 mm year and the q2sea of is at 74 mm year in the subsequent scenario analysis all 15 parameter sets are utilized while some results are also presented based on parameter sets selected based on the gwtrend of only the discussion will address the impact of parameter set selection and considerations for such selections 3 2 water management scenarios the three main water management scenarios based on managed aquifer recharge of excess river peak flow mar irrigation reduction irr and substitution of groundwater abstractions by snwt water snwt are implemented in the model for mar three sub scenarios are formulated recharging 25 50 and 100 of the excess river peak flows to upstream surface water reservoirs for irr there are also three sub scenarios of 5 10 and 20 reduction in irrigation water loss and for snwt the are two scenarios based on the 2017 allocations and the planned 2035 allocations all eight scenarios are run for the period 2000 2013 as a what if scenario where the original model simulation will act as a baseline reference the baseline and each scenario are run for the full 15 model ensemble fig 9a shows the resulting groundwater storage decline in mm year for the integrated model for ncp with the baseline in blue and the mar scenarios in orange irrigation scenarios in green and snwt scenarios in red none of the tested management scenarios can revert the general groundwater storage decline which is positive for all cases however the decline can be reduced compared to the baseline scenario for the entirety of the ncp the mar scenarios have little impact on groundwater storage decline as would be expected given the relatively small volume and local scale recharge increase irrigation has a large impact with an estimated reduction of 16 mm year 30 when reduced by 20 more moderate and perhaps more realistic irrigation reductions of 5 10 results in reductions of 4 and 8 mm year respectively the snwt scenario based on 2017 allocations can reduce the groundwater storage decline by 13 and 17 mm year respectively which is a significant contribution to the overexploitation challenge the effect of model parameter uncertainty expressed by the standard deviation between the 15 ensemble members is in the order of 15 mm year and very similar for all scenarios fig 9b depicts the same scenario analysis as 9a but based on just two parameter sets selected based on the gwtrend of this parameter set predicts generally lower storage changes around half compared to the full ensemble comparable to the analysis in fig 8 the impact of scenarios in fig 9b is similar to a in absolute terms mm year however the percentages are higher as a result of the generally lower storage change in the baseline this indicates that although the baseline storage change is associated with quite some uncertainty dependent on choice of of weight and parameter set the simulated impact of management scenario is quite robust the temporal evolution of the groundwater head changes in the deep aquifer for the baseline model and three selected scenarios is shown in fig 10 for the period 2000 2013 the figure illustrates how the groundwater head decline evolves gradually and the variability across the ensemble members likewise increases over time due to accumulation of differences in recharge rates for the irrigation scenario climate variability is a factor since it influences the annual irrigation abstraction and thereby the effect of a fixed percentage change the three scenarios mar100 irr20 and snwt2017 were chosen because they represent the largest individual impact among the main scenarios snwt2035 being an addition to snwt2017 further investigation of the spatial distribution in groundwater head changes are made for these three scenarios in fig 11 here the difference in groundwater head change between baseline and scenarios are mapped for the entire ncp model domain illustrating the spatially distributed impacts for the three scenarios the mar scenario has the smallest overall impact and are overall concentrated in the infiltration zones close to the mountain boundary where stormwater from boundary rivers enters the ncp via surface water reservoirs the irrigation scenario has a widespread impact across the ncp in the order of 2 m over 14 years with higher impacts in the drawdown cone south of tianjin this is a result of the general groundwater overdraft due to irrigation combined with the large cone of depression facilitating a larger rebound as a result of irrigation reduction the impact of the snwt scenario is concentrated around tianjin and beijing where most snwt water is allocated in the scenario due to the high population and consumption in these areas simulated head recovery relative to the baseline are as high as 10 m over the 14 year period since the impact of the mar scenarios is limited to the assigned infiltration zones an impact assessment for the entire ncp does not illustrate the local potential appropriately therefore a specific analysis is performed for the infiltration zone around the wei river fig 11 which has a large potential for infiltration of excess river peak flow this analysis is illustrated in fig 12 which is similar to fig 9 but calculated for the wei river area only for this area the mar scenarios have a relatively much larger impact than for the ncp in general and the mar impacts here are larger compared to the irrigation and snwt scenarios this exemplifies that mar can be a very impactful and valuable water management measure for reducing groundwater decline locally when suitable mar resources are available in combination with suitable infiltration conditions however as illustrated in fig 13 focusing on the shallow aquifer in the wei river recharge area the impact of the mar scenario tends to be dependent on very large recharge rates associated with individual wet years and storm events such as in 2003 for the mar100 modeling scenario where most of the groundwater storage recovery relative to the baseline happens in a single year 4 discussion the current study has improved the quantification of major water balance components for the ncp in a modeling framework the improvements have focused on the quantification of model boundary fluxes of lateral groundwater and surface water flow into the ncp better description and spatial distribution of water use within ncp and a better quantification of irrigation and evapotranspiration patterns in total these improvements will facilitate high resolution model results for better local water management while still accounting for the overall water balance for the ncp besides reducing the uncertainties on model boundary fluxes model calibration and subsequent scenario simulations were conducted in a multi objective ensemble framework which has allowed for increased insight into tradeoffs between calibration targets and the uncertainties associated with model parameterization the estimated baseline storage change 2000 2013 was estimated to be between 25 74 mm year depending on the calibration target fig 8 with an ensemble average of 55 mm y fig 9a the groundwater head trend gwtrend is considered the calibration target which is most directly related to simulated storage change out of the parameter ensemble the parameter sets that were selected based on the lowest gwtrend error had the lowest estimated storage change rate of 25 mm y this indicates a significant tradeoff between objective functions and that the ensemble mean of 55 mm y could represent an overestimation of the rate specifically owing to estimates from the ensemble members favoring the ssrq2sea objective function several previous studies have attempted to estimate the rate of groundwater storage change for the ncp based on hydrological models and grace data while the grace data allow for an observationally based estimate the region of interest is harder to define and a range of studies have documented storage change rates in the order of 8 46 mm year for the years since 2000 for areas overlapping with but not necessarily limited to the ncp huang et al 2015 moiwo et al 2009 tang et al 2013 model based estimates cover more varying time periods dating back from 1960 s and 70 s however studies with more recent coverage similar to both grace and the current study typically find drawdown rates in the range 30 55 mm y cao et al 2014 2013 qin et al 2013 which is very comparable to our findings a limitation of the current study might be that besides the gwtrend objective function none of the other calibration targets constrain the water balance effectively allowing the simulated groundwater recharge to vary considerably between the ensemble members based on the significant tradeoff between ensemble members this suggests that parameter sets which honor the gwtrend objective functions the most are likely to represent the most robust storage change estimates likewise previous modeling studies which have all been evaluated and optimized with respect to the rmse of groundwater heads but not specifically to the groundwater trend might suffer from a similar lack of constraint with respect to storage change the careful selection and examination of objective function design is particularly important in a hydrological system like the ncp where the catchment scale water balance cannot be constrained well with downstream river discharge observations in the ncp only a small fraction of the precipitation enters the rivers and subsequently the sea through river discharge on the contrary the system is dominated by evaporation and human consumption which is more difficult to measure and quantify in an aggregated form in spite of the large spread in simulated storage change between ensemble members there is generally agreement on the impact of management scenarios between the ensemble average and the models favoring the ssrgwtrend objective function fig 9 this indicates that the impact of management scenario can be estimated robustly even under uncertainty in the simulated historical storage change the mar scenario simulations indicate that the potential for reverting the large scale overdraft in the ncp is limited when considering the infiltration of excess river peak flow alone figs 9 11 in comparison the irrigation and snwt scenarios have a substantially larger potential and the three should be considered in combination the three management scenarios have not been evaluated in combination in this simulation study evaluating the summed impact of implementing all three types of management scenarios is not necessarily straight forward local effects from redirecting excess river water for mar could impact supply and demand of the groundwater resource the river water used for mar in this study is limited to excess peak flows why we assume that the spill over effects to the other management scenarios are limited impacts of the mar scenarios are largely unevenly distributed due to varying vicinity to rivers and upstream stormwater potential as indicated by the analysis of the wei river site the mar potential can be comparable to the other management scenarios locally and as such mar by stormwater infiltration could be a valuable water management option in such areas undoubtedly exploiting this potential will require substantial management infrastructures to secure infiltration of peak stormwater flows likewise the water quality of stormwater is a separate issue beyond the scope of this analysis the water source for mar is not restricted to excess river peak flow alone and additional sources like reclaimed water urban runoff etc could be considered to reveal the full potential for local groundwater recovery at the mar sites the model parameterization of the hydrogeology could be refined to reveal more detailed local impacts on the groundwater system but this has not been the focus of this study instead the focus has been on analyzing integrated management solutions to the ncp water shortage considering both small and large scale solutions the current study on water management scenarios is limited to what if scenarios for the period 2000 2013 without inclusion of additional drivers such as changes in population and water demands or climate the focus has been on establishing the best possible hydrological dataset and model for describing the distributed water resource of the ncp for the study period potentially climate change and changes in demand will increase the pressure on groundwater resources in the ncp which has been investigated in other studies qin et al 2019 from the mar scenario perspective climate change induced increases in stormwater peak flow could increase the mar infiltration potential however this analysis should be seen in the context of other climate change impacts such as increased irrigation demand and general changes in precipitation recent studies have documented an increased water use efficiency wue in the ncp koch et al 2020 liu et al 2015 mo et al 2017 indicating that irrigation water consumption reductions in the order of 10 20 might be realistic while maintaining the current crop production other studies have however described the irrigation efficiency paradox where efficiency improvements are countered by increase in production to the level of previous water consumption grafton et al 2018 this illustrates the strong need for a combined effort on irrigation efficiently crop selection and legislation to effectively reduce water consumption in the ncp 5 conclusion compared to previous modeling studies on the ncp the current study has made improvements to major water balance components especially regarding their spatial distribution these improvements include spatially distributed water demand maps and better boundary conditions for both surface and groundwater flow from the upstream mountains of the haihe region in addition detailed spatial maps of irrigation water consumption from a recent study koch et al 2020 has been utilized to improve the quantification of irrigation which is the major anthropogenic control of the water balance across the ncp the hydrological modeling work has been performed in a multi objective uncertainty framework where five different data sources have been exploited in guiding model parameter optimization the optimization resulted in a range of plausible parameter sets representing the trade offs between calibration targets and finally a subset of 15 non dominated solution was chosen to represent an ensemble of parameter sets that can shed light on the impact of parameter uncertainties the modeling on historical data resulted in an estimated ensemble mean storage change for the ncp of 55 mm y 2000 2013 tradeoff between objective functions was however substantial and parameter sets resulting in the lowest error for the groundwater head trend objective function gwtrend suggested storage change rates of around 25 mm y the model ensemble was subsequently utilized for assessing impacts of different water management scenarios these illustrated that at the scale of the ncp mar in the form of infiltration of excess river peak flow volumes has relatively little impact in comparison to reduction in irrigation or expansion of the south north water transfer however for a local region in the piedmont area along the western boundary of the basin mar could have a substantial impact on local groundwater resources comparable to major water management strategies such as reduction in irrigation and increased in inter basin water transfers

7984,the region studied is the 137 000 km2 north china plain ncp a region with high population density and a major agricultural production leading to unsustainable exploitation of groundwater resources previous modeling studies in the region have utilized simplified representations of model boundary fluxes both regarding lateral inflows from surface and groundwater and related to water demands and consumptions the current study focusses on developing a hydrological modeling framework with better spatial descriptions of major water balance components regarding water demands model boundary conditions of surface and groundwater inflows and evaporative losses due to irrigation compared to previous efforts the modeling framework utilizes a novel multi objective parameter optimization strategy combined with an ensemble modeling approach to illuminate optimization trade offs and impacts of parameter uncertainty groundwater storage declines are estimated to be in the order of 25 55 mm y for the period 2000 2013 the impacts of water management strategies are explored using the model ensemble and show that this decline can be counterbalanced by approximately 15 20 mm y by substantial reductions in irrigation 20 or implementation of planned inter basin water transfers managed aquifer recharge in the form of infiltrating excess river peak flows can only reduce groundwater storage declines to a limited degree however at the local to regional scale storage decline reductions from mar are in the same order of magnitude as other extensive water management strategies graphical abstract ga1 keywords large scale modeling multi objective calibration managed aquifer recharge water resources management 1 introduction the north china plain ncp has for decades been experiencing groundwater overdraft driven by human consumption taylor et al 2013 the overdraft is a result of a rapid industrialization and population growth combined with extensive irrigation based agriculture huang et al 2015 pan et al 2017 the high water demand has over the past decades resulted in declining groundwater tables across the entire ncp as observed by both in situ and satellite based gravimetrical observations shen et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 some of the cascading effects from the declining groundwater tables are land subsidence drying riverbeds deterioration of water quality and a need for deeper wells zheng et al 2010 the emergence of these effects has caused the government of the people s republic of china to put the problem of water scarcity and quality high on the political agenda thus a stringent management of the water resources in china has been put forward in recent policies to minimize the gap between water supply and demand ambitious political goals of capping water demand increasing water use efficiency and improving water quality in the regions of china with major water problems has been formalized in policy documents such as the no 1 policy document ministry of agriculture of the people s republic of china 2010 three red lines global water partnership 2015 and the water ten plan the state council the people s republic of china 2015 the goal of reducing groundwater overdraft in haihe river basin is clear but the solutions are manifold so far an emphasis has been put on large scale inter basin transfer projects as the south to north water transfer snwt project but such cost intensive engineering solutions cannot stand alone in solving the water scarcity issues of the ncp jiang 2015 increasing attention has been given to alternative storage solutions such as managed aquifer recharge mar mar is a well known technology where aquifer storage capacity is utilized to actively store various excess water resources in the subsurface dillon et al 2019 in contrast to spontaneous incidental aquifer recharge mar is a way to optimize the water resources management in areas with depleted or unreliable groundwater aquifer storage mar does not create new water resources but with local water sources a natural underground storage with benefits such as limited evaporation increased baseflow and resilience towards aquifer storage depletion can potentially alleviate water scarcity the technology is widespread across the world but is still fairly immature in china zheng et al 2016 in 2019 the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china mwrprc issued the comprehensive recovery and regulation plan of groundwater exploitation in north china district ÂçéÂåóÂú∞Âå∫Âú∞‰∏ãÊ∞¥Ë∂ÖÈááÁªºÂêàÊ≤ªÁêÜÊñπÊ°à from hereon abbreviated as the ncd groundwater plan the plan consists of goals for 2022 and 2035 focusing on fully utilizing the snwt capacity as well as managed groundwater recharge in presently dried out riverbeds with such a paradigm shift from incidental aquifer recharge to mar groundwater recharge can be managed in a way that benefits socio economic environmental and supply enhancement objectives several studies have investigated the effect of overexploitation of the groundwater resource in the ncp these studies use both in situ observations of groundwater level decline large scale storage change estimates from gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data and groundwater modeling among the observationally based studies shen et al 2015 estimated a 17 mm y groundwater storage decline for the entire haihe river basin using both in situ water level observations and grace observations for the period 2003 2012 since drawdown in the haihe river basin mainly occurs in the ncp the corresponding number for ncp would be considerably higher such observation based estimates are indispensable in the documentation and communication of the severe consequences of groundwater overdraft however these observations typically represent either a very small scale well observations or a very large footprint without spatial detail or encompassing more than the ncp alone grace in addition the observation based monitoring does not allow for scenario testing such as climate change projection or water management groundwater modeling can potentially fill both the spatial scale gap and enable scenario testing and thereby serve as decision support on how to reach good water management alternatives previous studies have modeled the entire groundwater system of the ncp cao et al 2013 developed a regional groundwater model calibrating spatio temporal groundwater recharge in order to evaluate groundwater storage declines in time 1970 2008 obtaining an estimated 17 60 mm y in storage decline qin et al 2013 added to the understanding of the groundwater dynamics of the ncp by calibrating a distributed surface water groundwater model to observed groundwater head time series to calculate the water balance components and test water management scenarios they estimated a 55 mm y storage decline for the period 2000 2008 in the highly engineered and complex water system of haihe river basin hydrological modeling must consider both major water infrastructure projects and a dominating human consumption with the past and ongoing groundwater overdraft on the ncp scenario analysis on future water management has been a focus of multiple studies more recently qin et al 2019 focused on regional water balance impacts from future water management scenarios in a coupled hydrological and system dynamic model adding effects of future climate change on the smaller scale long et al 2020 used a multi objective calibrated hydrological model to evaluate the impact of future snwt allocation to beijing in combination with climate change scenarios studies evaluating the effect of mar as a water management option on the ncp has been carried out in small regional studies e g hao et al 2014 rong et al 2017 or as crude contributions to the overall groundwater balance of the ncp cao et al 2013 to our knowledge no distributed modeling studies evaluating the potential of large scale implementation of mar on the ncp has been carried out in relation to previous large scale groundwater modeling studies of the ncp two modeling aspects have been simplified and should be investigated further the first is the better representation of model boundary fluxes both lateral boundaries and the second are detailed spatially distributed demands and consumptions we hypothesize that by improving these model inputs the uncertainty on predicted storage changes can be reduced lastly a better acknowledgement of model uncertainty especially related to model parameterization can help quantify uncertainties we address the model boundary flux issues by incorporating lateral boundary fluxes for both surface and groundwater from a larger scale hydrological model of the entire haihe river basin and by specifying spatio temporal irrigation consumption data at the model grid scale obtained from remote sensing data koch et al 2020 in addition we utilize national sector specific data on water demands and inter basin water transfers and distribute these according to source proximity and population density the model parameter uncertainty is addressed through a calibration framework based on multiple objectives of groundwater head amplitudes trends and bias spatial patterns of evapotranspiration and river discharge the applied pareto achieving parameter optimization approach using multiple objective functions swayne and hrebicek 2007 enables the selection of an ensemble of parameter sets from a five dimensional pareto front the selected model ensemble is subsequently utilized in an assessment of water management scenarios including a first estimate of large scale mar implementation in the ncp the mar scenarios based on managed recharge of surface water peak flow from the taihang and yan mountains are benchmarked against both a baseline scenario and water management scenarios related to the snwt and irrigation 2 methods 2 1 study site description the model region is located in the north china plain often referred to as the food basket of china it covers megacities as beijing and tianjin as well as parts of the provinces hebei henan and shandong amounting to a total area of 137 200 km2 the agricultural intensive plain area of the ncp model region is bordered by the taihang and yan mountains to the west and north respectively which altogether makes up the haihe river basin the yellow river defines the southern border of the model region where it flows to the bohai sea through its lower reaches fig 1 outlines the haihe river basin and the ncp model region the area is dominated by a continental semi arid climate with a distinct rainy season during the months june september accounting for 70 85 of the 475 mm yearly precipitation 2002 2016 koch et al 2020 agricultural land covers 80 of the area koch et al 2020 which is dominated by a double cropping system where summer maize is grown june september in rotation with winter wheat grown october june zhang et al 2011 approximately 70 of the annual water supply goes into the agricultural sector national bureau of statistics of china 2017a with a discrepancy between timing in peak irrigation demands for winter wheat in may and the start of the rainy season in june human consumption has been identified as a cause for the over exploitation of the groundwater resources of the region rodell et al 2018 and especially agricultural irrigation and industrial water are key drivers for water use in china zhou et al 2020 surface water made up approximately 30 of the regions water supply 2000 2013 national bureau of statistics of china 2017a and natural runoff from the taihang and yan mountains are regulated by major surface water reservoirs at the fringe of the model region over the same period groundwater covered approximately 65 of the water supply an approach to close the demand supply gap has been the construction of the major snwt water infrastructure project from 2014 the snwt middle route was fully operational all the way to beijing and has since allocated up to 4 5 km3 yearly to beijing tianjin and hebei provinces from the sources in the yangtze river basin 2 2 the hydrological model the hydrological model was set up using the mike she modeling software mike she provides a deterministic distributed physically based model set up where the hydrological processes of saturated flow overland flow and channel flow are simulated using the finite differences method unsaturated flow and evapotranspiration was simulated by a simplified 2 layer uz et model for the unsaturated zone compartment of the model dhi 2017a the model domain was discretized into a 1 1km grid and computed with a time step interval of 1 day channel flow was simulated using the mike hydro river modeling package solving the saint venant flow equations for hydrodynamic river network modeling dhi 2017b 2 2 1 conceptual model setup a conceptual illustration of the major water balance components of the ncp model can be seen in fig 2 lateral groundwater recharge natural surface water inflow from the upstream mountainous regions as well as precipitation and irrigation are inputs to the ncp groundwater model distributed total water demands are calculated separately for irrigation urban uwd industrial iwd and ecological water demands ewd which are all withdrawn from the saturated zone surface water bodies in the area are highly regulated with dikes and reservoirs and most river stretches are known to run dry hence a part of the surface water inflow will recharge the saturated zone and thus be available for subsequent groundwater pumping effectively as river bank infiltration this partitioning is controlled by a calibrated leakage coefficient the inter basin transfers yellow river and snwt imported to the model region are deducted from the full water demands groundwater and surface water boundaries as well as the irrigation input to the model are based on the hydrological modeling work of the haihe river basin published by koch et al 2020 run with the same climate forcing data used in the model setup of this study these model boundary estimates are explained in more detail in later sections fig 1 shows the areal extent of the haihe river basin model the major river inflows to the ncp model region as well as adjacent areas dominated by groundwater recharge resulting in a lateral groundwater flux to the ncp model boundaries the model irrigation input is based on a dual modeling approach using satellite estimates and a hydrological model to produce spatially distributed estimates of net irrigation at monthly time steps for the haihe river basin from a study by koch et al 2020 net irrigation corresponds to the water used for irrigation that ultimately leaves the land surface through et the net irrigation was used in two terms of model inputs 1 as an addition to natural precipitation in order to match the observed et patterns in the subsequent model calibration 2 as a part of the distributed groundwater pumping for irrigation multiplied a return flow correction factor to represent the full applied irrigation descriptions of the hydrological model input data boundary flows numerical calculations of each component in the water balance including the irrigation return flow factor can be found in the subsequent sections see also tables 1 and 2 for details 2 2 2 model input data for this study the mswep v2 beck et al 2019 data was used as precipitation forcing data the potential evapotranspiration forcing data was calculated by koch et al 2020 with the pyeto package in python based on the fao 56 penman monteith method allen et al 1998 based on era interim data provided by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf both forcing data sets were processed to a 10 10km spatial resolution and a temporal resolution of daily time steps in the model setup the main drivers for computing actual evapotranspiration are the meteorological data and vegetation properties in the simplified 2 layer uz et model actual evapotranspiration is based on potential et and vegetation properties according to the fao guidelines allen et al 1998 vegetation properties used in the model setup to determine actual et are leaf area index lai crop coefficient kc and root depth

diff akc rdmin and rdmax were calibration parameters the 2 layer unsaturated zone module was parameterized based on the spatially distributed soil property data set of sand silt clay and bulk density from the harmonized world soil database v 1 2 by food and agriculture organization fao fischer et al 2019 a weighted average of the four soil properties over the depth of the soil profile was re calculated into a 1 1km grid by using the python sci kit learn package the resulting soil classes were re classified into 37 new soil classes with the k means clustering algorithm based on the depth averaged soil properties hydraulic properties of hydrological conductivity as well as saturation field capacity and wilting point soil moisture for these 37 soil classes were found using the neural network algorithm of the rosetta module in the hydrus software ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2008 and from the van genuchten equation van genuchten 1980 the resulting 37 classes of hydrological properties were again re classified using k means into a total of 10 classes based on their hydrogeological properties the saturated zone of the model consisted of a multi layered heterogeneous and anisotropic representation of the subsurface geology each geological unit was delineated based on the dominating hydrogeological features of the subsurface in the region this study adopted the conceptual understanding of the subsurface geology represented by a shallow aquifer and two deeper confined aquifers from previous conceptualizations of the groundwater aquifer system proposed by cao et al 2013 and qin et al 2013 the deepest sections of the shallow and deep aquifer systems were 220 and 560 mbsl respectively the shallow and deep aquifers were delineated into six and five geological sub units respectively based on maps of hydrogeological features produced by the china geological survey boundary conditions were parted into coastline and the boundaries on land lateral groundwater flow to the piedmont region of the shallow aquifer were found from the distributed groundwater recharge estimated by a regional hydrological model of the haihe river basin fig 1 koch et al 2020 this regional model was setup in the mhm model code samaniego et al 2010 and the model was run with the same climate forcing data as used for this study and calibrated against remotely sensed evapotranspiration and river discharge koch et al 2020 recharge areas were delineated based on watershed delineation of minor rivers and channels along the fringe of the piedmont area resulting in six recharge areas sloping towards piedmont region of the model with a maximum distance from the model boundary of 130 km fig 1 inflows from the larger upstream rivers are dominated by the surface water component and not included in the lateral groundwater inflow boundaries based on the groundwater recharge estimates and recharge source areas time series of daily lateral groundwater flux along the six sections of the piedmont fringe could be estimated lateral groundwater recharge was implemented as boundary flux to the shallow aquifer only a lateral groundwater inflow of 1 26 km3 year for the whole ncp model domain was estimated over the period 1996 2005 this corresponds well to previous findings ranging from 1 to 2 km3 year cao et al 2013 the shallow aquifer coastline had a fixed head boundary whereas the boundary condition along the yellow river was set to no flow for the deep aquifer layers the boundary conditions were set to no flow in the entire domain the model river network outlined in fig 1 represents the major river systems in the haihe river basin upstream inflow boundaries were based on modeling results from the regional scale haihe river basin hydrological model koch et al 2020 all of the rivers are heavily regulated by dam operations at their inlet to the ncp model domain most rivers experience substantial surface water depletion on their path through the ncp this was simulated with a leakage coefficient calibrated against observed outflow to the bohai gulf to the east resulting upstream river inflow boundaries accounts for 4 4 km3 year on average over the period 1996 2005 as a comparison in the period 2000 2005 approximately 1 5 km3 year reached the bohai sea from the haihe river basin according to haihe river water conservancy commission 2016 2 2 3 water abstractions official data on water use in the model region is highly aggregated with the smallest scale being prefecture city level and irrigation estimates are even more difficult to obtain distributed water demands of the model were therefore calculated from remote sensing based data sets major cones of depression have been documented near the big cities within the region as well as in the irrigation intensive areas e g feng et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 supporting the assumption of the water demand being closely related to the population density and irrigation demand distribution in the region population density maps were used to correlate aggregated provincial statistics on water demand to a spatially distributed water demand estimate irrigation demands were as already mentioned based on dual modeling relying on remote sensing data sets and estimated in a previous study by koch et al 2020 the water infrastructure of the haihe river basin is highly engineered allowing for transfers of surface water sources as well as inter basin transfers around the basin in the calculation of a distributed water demand estimate inter basin transfers are deducted from the full water demand estimate as a function of distance from the water infrastructure importing the water transfers the result is a fully distributed water abstraction data set correlated with the region population density and influenced by its vicinity to surface and inter basin water sources the following sections will elaborate further on the methodology 2 2 3 1 irrigation demand a substantial amount of water from the yellow river is diverted for agricultural use in henan shandong and hebei province ranging from 6 to 11 km3 year during 1998 2016 according to the yellow river conservancy commission 2020 from the lower reaches of the yellow river major diversion channels exist into all three provinces again data of yellow river diversions is not publicly available at a resolution higher than province level to account for surface water irrigation in the distributed irrigation product a proximity optimization algorithm was developed based on linear programming using the docplex package in python the algorithm reduced groundwater based irrigation in each cell of the model domain as a function of vicinity to the yellow river constrained by yearly time series of yellow river diversions to mimic that irrigation is sustained by yellow river water rather than groundwater min c x 3 s t t 1 t n 1 n irr n t x n t q y r t t 1 t n 1 n 1 f n n 1 x n x n 1 0 x n 1 where c is a cost vector with equal costs

of model time steps irr is the irrigation qyr is the time series of area weighted average of diversions to agriculture in hebei shandong and henan province and f is a relative yellow river proximity factor between xn and xn 1 representing the relative proximity of model cells to the river in order to correlate the net irrigation estimate from koch et al 2020 with irrigation groundwater pumping in the model setup a return flow factor was calculated a model setup with a well performing parametrization was run with net irrigation as the groundwater pumping for irrigation both with and without the net irrigation added to the precipitation input a pumping correction factor firr was calculated which increased groundwater pumping to match a zero change in long term groundwater storage between the two model setups the resulting return flow correction factor firr of 1 34 corresponding to a return flow fraction of 34 was multiplied to the distributed irrigation data and implemented as groundwater pumping for irrigation 2 2 3 2 urban industrial and ecological water demands in addition to irrigation water demands the model region is densely populated with an average population density of 550 people km2 national bureau of statistics of china 2017b distributed water demands were estimated from water supply statistics and population density data publicly available statistics on urban industrial and ecological water supply are available from the china statistical yearbook published by the national bureau of statistics of china 2017 reported on province level at a yearly basis per capita water supply time series from 1998 to 2016 for each of the three aforementioned sectors were found from statistics as an area weighted average of the five provinces beijing tianjin hebei henan and shandong covered by the model region groundwater pumping times series were based on yearly province water supply statistics corrected for the inter basin yellow river and snwt water transfer allocations losses re circulation and re infiltration of supplied water is accounted for by using sector specific consumption rates provided by the hai river water conservancy commission the inter basin transfers were assumed allocated to each sector proportionally to their relative supply eq 4 exemplify the calculation of the domestic water demand 4 dem dom cap t f rc dom i 1 i f a i ws dom i

in each sector these fractions will not return to the local water cycle and is considered a consumptive demand per capita water demand statistics were estimated separately for beijing and tianjin provinces while the rest of the model domain was represented by an area weighted per capita water demand of the provinces hebei shandong and henan per capita water demand estimates were based on the landscan high resolution global population data set bright et al 2017 from 2000 to 2016 which was also used to create the distributed population density correlated groundwater pumping map water demands were implemented in the model with a 4 4 km resolution resulting long term averages of groundwater pumping time series for domestic industrial ecological and irrigation water demand can be seen in fig 3 2 3 calibration method the model was calibrated with a split sample approach covering the period 1996 2008 the 1996 2000 input data set was used as a calibration spin up period and the model performance was evaluated for the 2000 2005 calibration period a final model validation was performed on the 2006 2008 period data used for calibration and validation were observed groundwater heads satellite based evapotranspiration and river outflow statistics groundwater head observations covered the period 2000 2008 qin et al 2013 from a total of 201 wells 141 in the shallow aquifer unit and 60 wells in the deep aquifers fig 1 actual evapotranspiration were evaluated against long term means of satellite based evapotranspiration using the pt jpl thermal model 2002 2016 koch et al 2020 the river leakage from 12 major natural river stretches in the luanhe chaobaihe yongdinghe daqinghe ziyahe and zhangweihe river systems were calibrated against average yearly statistics of river to sea flow fractions 2000 2005 from the haihe river water conservancy commission 2016 calibration was performed with the model independent ostrich optimization software matott 2017 using the parapadds search algorithm swayne and hrebicek 2007 parapadds is a parallelized multi objective dynamically dimension search dds tolson and shoemaker 2007 algorithm that identifies a pareto front of non dominated optimal solutions which is useful for multi criteria calibration the parapadds algorithm was run with the user settings of maximum 800 iteration a 0 2 perturbation value and the

horizontal hydraulic conductivity while a uniform anisotropy factor was shared for all geological units with the exception of a single geounit with large groundwater drawdowns specific storage and specific yields for each geological unit were tied in two categories for geological units in the shallow and deep aquifers respectively parameters for calculating distributed root depth and crop coefficients were also included as calibration parameters along with a leakage factor for river network surface water groundwater interactions 2 4 water management scenarios the calibrated model was used to explore scenarios for future water management on the ncp compared to a business as usual baseline the scenarios were developed in collaboration with water experts in china from southern university of science and technology sustech university of jinan and institute of hydropower beijing water science and technology institute and water resources research iwhr whom have a close connection to the water resources management sector in haihe river basin with an onset in the political plan comprehensive recovery and regulation plan of groundwater exploitation in north china district ncd groundwater plan issued by the mwrprc three overarching scenarios with a total of eight sub scenarios for future water management were outlined the scenarios concerned three different aspects of water management re allocation of water resources using mar supply augmentation from the snwt middle route and demand reduction of agricultural irrigation the model implementation of the baseline and three water management scenarios are described below 2 4 1 baseline scenario the baseline scenario was run for the 14 year reference period 2000 2013 representing a wide range of climatic and hydrological conditions model inputs of water demands river boundaries climatic data etc covered the full reference period in total 15 sets of model parameterizations sampled from the ostrich parapadds non dominated solutions were run for the baseline scenario reflecting a range of diverse but equally plausible model parameterizations the same sub set of 15 model parameterizations were used in all water management scenarios 2 4 2 mar scenario the mar scenarios in the current study utilized peak flood water for riverbed infiltration in the selected infiltration zones in the piedmont region fig 1 peak flows of natural runoff exceeding the 85th percentile for each of the river boundary inflow time series were assumed to be flood water suitable and applicable for mar similar to the 80 90th percentile approach suggested by alam et al 2020 and kocis and dahlke 2017 for the central valley in california for the reference period 2000 2013 these peak flows on average equaled 0 74 km3 year three scenarios utilizing 100 50 and 25 of the total peak flows were simulated to represent various levels of efficiencies capturing the available peak flow for mar mar was implemented in the model by reducing the river inflow boundary monthly runoff time series with the respective peak flow time series resulting in reduced upstream peak inflows to the model domain the corresponding peaks were infiltrated as negative pumping during the four wet months june september in injection wells distributed at a 4 km distance along both sides of the downstream river network passing through the piedmont mar sites outlined in fig 1 2 4 3 snwt scenario snwt middle route allocations as of year 2017 and the goals of increase by year 2035 as stated in the ncd groundwater plan snwt middle route allocations to hebei beijing and tianjin provinces were in total 4 5 km3 in year 2017 and with an increase of 1 2 km3 it is expected to rise to 5 7 km3 in year 2035 snwt are allocated to substitute groundwater pumping for the water demands in the three sectors domestic industrial and ecological the supply augmentation from the snwt middle route is assumed to reduce water consumption within a 100 km buffer zone from the snwt middle route outlined in fig 1 the reduced consumption is calculated as the snwt allocation fraction fsnwt of the total population scaled water demand as presented earlier in fig 3 within the 100 km buffer zone from the snwt middle route water demands of all groundwater pumping wells located within this buffer is recalculated considering also the fraction of consumption frc used to calculate the distributed water demand estimates below is an example recalculating domestic water demand dom within the buffer zone 14 do m snwt dom f rc dom 1 f snwt 2 4 4 irrigation scenario this scenario describes a reduction of irrigation to simulate either increased water use efficiency decreased demand by land use change or a combination of the two the irrigation scenarios are implemented as reduced groundwater pumping for irrigation the distributed estimate of groundwater pumping for irrigation is reduced by 5 10 and 20 the reduction is done after subtracting surface water allocations from the yellow river for irrigation resulting in a less pronounced effect in surface water fed irrigation areas the corresponding reduction in net irrigation is also subtracted the precipitation term including both precipitation and net irrigation 3 results 3 1 model calibration the model calibration based on the five objective functions using the ostrich parapadds optimizer with five parallel model executions lasted 600 hrs on a xeon e5 4620 2 6ghz server the calibration resulted in 298 non dominated solutions forming a five dimensional pareto front 15 model parameterizations were chosen from the 298 non dominated solutions through a two step procedure first a pre screening was performed with a cutoff of 3 standard deviations above the minimum objective function error ofe for each of which will remove solutions that perform very poorly on individual ofs subsequently the ofe of the remaining 171 solutions fig 4a are normalized by their ofe between ofmin and ofmax for each of summing the normalized ofes enables a balanced score across all ofs based on the balance of score the five best balanced solutions are selected along with the two best solutions for each individual of that still fall with the 50 best balanced solutions the selection is a compromise between representing all of s and an ensemble size requiring reasonable computational resources a manageable ensemble size was set at 15 ensemble members five of the 15 ensemble members represented the balanced solutions while two parameter sets from each of the specific of s were included to make up the 15 member ensemble this ensured a selection with most emphasis on a balanced parameter set the selected 15 solutions are displayed in fig 4b this selection secures a representation of each of and enables analysis of the tradeoff between of while also enabling a balanced solution all subsequent results will represent these 15 parameter sets table 3 which are carried forward in model performance evaluation and scenario modeling whereby acknowledging and quantifying effects of model parameter uncertainty model performance on simulated groundwater head for all observation wells is given in fig 5 for both the calibration period and validation period the bias me is 3 80 m 0 79 m for the calibration period and 1 5 m 1 72 m for the validation period rmse s are large at 20 59 m 0 71 m and 21 60 m 0 41 m for calibration and validation respectively the large rmse s are mainly caused by the inability of the model to reproduce some very large observed drawdowns in the coastal region around tianjin south of beijing where observed heads are down to 90 m below sea level simulated and observed groundwater head trends and annual amplitudes are illustrated in fig 6 as means across all shallow and deep wells used for calibration this comparison shows a good overall agreement on the direction of the trends and for the deep wells also on the slope which is important for the model s ability to estimate drawdowns as a result of groundwater consumption and climate variability annual amplitudes are on average greatly underestimated for the shallow wells and also underestimated for the deep wells fig 6 the underestimation of annual amplitudes could owe to a temporal smoothing by delayed groundwater recharge for the shallow aquifer while the amplitudes in the deep aquifer is assumed to be more controlled by a combination of temporal patterns in recharge and abstraction a key element of the model application is the estimation of annual groundwater storage and groundwater head decline both spatially and across the entire ncp the spatial pattern in simulated groundwater head for the deep aquifer for the year 2000 is illustrated in fig 7a showing the expected gradient from high groundwater levels along the mountain range boundary in the south and west towards lower values at the bohai sea region and drawdowns around tianjin fig 7b displays the simulated groundwater head change drawdown for the period 2000 2013 here the influence of the major urban centers at beijing tianjin and shijiazhuang is visible with general head declines in the order of 15 25 m over 14 years for the agriculturally dominated piedmont plain where irrigation is the main consumer of groundwater the decline is typically 2 7 m over 14 years with an average for the entire model area of 4 2 m 0 3 mm year for the deep aquifer in addition to groundwater level changes which are a combination of storage change and aquifer properties the groundwater storage change itself expressed in mm year is the common metric for volumetric water deficits the simulated groundwater storage decline 2000 2013 expressed in mm year for the entire ncp and all modeled aquifers is 50 15 mm year when averaged for all 15 parameter sets however fig 8 reveals that there is a substantial spread in this estimate among the different solution depending on which objective function the parameter set was selected to favor the five balanced solutions dominate the average estimate representing 5 of 15 solutions and therefore results in a similar value of 55 mm year while the gwbias and gwtrend of s are lower at around 25 33 mm the gwamp and spaef are around 50 mm year and the q2sea of is at 74 mm year in the subsequent scenario analysis all 15 parameter sets are utilized while some results are also presented based on parameter sets selected based on the gwtrend of only the discussion will address the impact of parameter set selection and considerations for such selections 3 2 water management scenarios the three main water management scenarios based on managed aquifer recharge of excess river peak flow mar irrigation reduction irr and substitution of groundwater abstractions by snwt water snwt are implemented in the model for mar three sub scenarios are formulated recharging 25 50 and 100 of the excess river peak flows to upstream surface water reservoirs for irr there are also three sub scenarios of 5 10 and 20 reduction in irrigation water loss and for snwt the are two scenarios based on the 2017 allocations and the planned 2035 allocations all eight scenarios are run for the period 2000 2013 as a what if scenario where the original model simulation will act as a baseline reference the baseline and each scenario are run for the full 15 model ensemble fig 9a shows the resulting groundwater storage decline in mm year for the integrated model for ncp with the baseline in blue and the mar scenarios in orange irrigation scenarios in green and snwt scenarios in red none of the tested management scenarios can revert the general groundwater storage decline which is positive for all cases however the decline can be reduced compared to the baseline scenario for the entirety of the ncp the mar scenarios have little impact on groundwater storage decline as would be expected given the relatively small volume and local scale recharge increase irrigation has a large impact with an estimated reduction of 16 mm year 30 when reduced by 20 more moderate and perhaps more realistic irrigation reductions of 5 10 results in reductions of 4 and 8 mm year respectively the snwt scenario based on 2017 allocations can reduce the groundwater storage decline by 13 and 17 mm year respectively which is a significant contribution to the overexploitation challenge the effect of model parameter uncertainty expressed by the standard deviation between the 15 ensemble members is in the order of 15 mm year and very similar for all scenarios fig 9b depicts the same scenario analysis as 9a but based on just two parameter sets selected based on the gwtrend of this parameter set predicts generally lower storage changes around half compared to the full ensemble comparable to the analysis in fig 8 the impact of scenarios in fig 9b is similar to a in absolute terms mm year however the percentages are higher as a result of the generally lower storage change in the baseline this indicates that although the baseline storage change is associated with quite some uncertainty dependent on choice of of weight and parameter set the simulated impact of management scenario is quite robust the temporal evolution of the groundwater head changes in the deep aquifer for the baseline model and three selected scenarios is shown in fig 10 for the period 2000 2013 the figure illustrates how the groundwater head decline evolves gradually and the variability across the ensemble members likewise increases over time due to accumulation of differences in recharge rates for the irrigation scenario climate variability is a factor since it influences the annual irrigation abstraction and thereby the effect of a fixed percentage change the three scenarios mar100 irr20 and snwt2017 were chosen because they represent the largest individual impact among the main scenarios snwt2035 being an addition to snwt2017 further investigation of the spatial distribution in groundwater head changes are made for these three scenarios in fig 11 here the difference in groundwater head change between baseline and scenarios are mapped for the entire ncp model domain illustrating the spatially distributed impacts for the three scenarios the mar scenario has the smallest overall impact and are overall concentrated in the infiltration zones close to the mountain boundary where stormwater from boundary rivers enters the ncp via surface water reservoirs the irrigation scenario has a widespread impact across the ncp in the order of 2 m over 14 years with higher impacts in the drawdown cone south of tianjin this is a result of the general groundwater overdraft due to irrigation combined with the large cone of depression facilitating a larger rebound as a result of irrigation reduction the impact of the snwt scenario is concentrated around tianjin and beijing where most snwt water is allocated in the scenario due to the high population and consumption in these areas simulated head recovery relative to the baseline are as high as 10 m over the 14 year period since the impact of the mar scenarios is limited to the assigned infiltration zones an impact assessment for the entire ncp does not illustrate the local potential appropriately therefore a specific analysis is performed for the infiltration zone around the wei river fig 11 which has a large potential for infiltration of excess river peak flow this analysis is illustrated in fig 12 which is similar to fig 9 but calculated for the wei river area only for this area the mar scenarios have a relatively much larger impact than for the ncp in general and the mar impacts here are larger compared to the irrigation and snwt scenarios this exemplifies that mar can be a very impactful and valuable water management measure for reducing groundwater decline locally when suitable mar resources are available in combination with suitable infiltration conditions however as illustrated in fig 13 focusing on the shallow aquifer in the wei river recharge area the impact of the mar scenario tends to be dependent on very large recharge rates associated with individual wet years and storm events such as in 2003 for the mar100 modeling scenario where most of the groundwater storage recovery relative to the baseline happens in a single year 4 discussion the current study has improved the quantification of major water balance components for the ncp in a modeling framework the improvements have focused on the quantification of model boundary fluxes of lateral groundwater and surface water flow into the ncp better description and spatial distribution of water use within ncp and a better quantification of irrigation and evapotranspiration patterns in total these improvements will facilitate high resolution model results for better local water management while still accounting for the overall water balance for the ncp besides reducing the uncertainties on model boundary fluxes model calibration and subsequent scenario simulations were conducted in a multi objective ensemble framework which has allowed for increased insight into tradeoffs between calibration targets and the uncertainties associated with model parameterization the estimated baseline storage change 2000 2013 was estimated to be between 25 74 mm year depending on the calibration target fig 8 with an ensemble average of 55 mm y fig 9a the groundwater head trend gwtrend is considered the calibration target which is most directly related to simulated storage change out of the parameter ensemble the parameter sets that were selected based on the lowest gwtrend error had the lowest estimated storage change rate of 25 mm y this indicates a significant tradeoff between objective functions and that the ensemble mean of 55 mm y could represent an overestimation of the rate specifically owing to estimates from the ensemble members favoring the ssrq2sea objective function several previous studies have attempted to estimate the rate of groundwater storage change for the ncp based on hydrological models and grace data while the grace data allow for an observationally based estimate the region of interest is harder to define and a range of studies have documented storage change rates in the order of 8 46 mm year for the years since 2000 for areas overlapping with but not necessarily limited to the ncp huang et al 2015 moiwo et al 2009 tang et al 2013 model based estimates cover more varying time periods dating back from 1960 s and 70 s however studies with more recent coverage similar to both grace and the current study typically find drawdown rates in the range 30 55 mm y cao et al 2014 2013 qin et al 2013 which is very comparable to our findings a limitation of the current study might be that besides the gwtrend objective function none of the other calibration targets constrain the water balance effectively allowing the simulated groundwater recharge to vary considerably between the ensemble members based on the significant tradeoff between ensemble members this suggests that parameter sets which honor the gwtrend objective functions the most are likely to represent the most robust storage change estimates likewise previous modeling studies which have all been evaluated and optimized with respect to the rmse of groundwater heads but not specifically to the groundwater trend might suffer from a similar lack of constraint with respect to storage change the careful selection and examination of objective function design is particularly important in a hydrological system like the ncp where the catchment scale water balance cannot be constrained well with downstream river discharge observations in the ncp only a small fraction of the precipitation enters the rivers and subsequently the sea through river discharge on the contrary the system is dominated by evaporation and human consumption which is more difficult to measure and quantify in an aggregated form in spite of the large spread in simulated storage change between ensemble members there is generally agreement on the impact of management scenarios between the ensemble average and the models favoring the ssrgwtrend objective function fig 9 this indicates that the impact of management scenario can be estimated robustly even under uncertainty in the simulated historical storage change the mar scenario simulations indicate that the potential for reverting the large scale overdraft in the ncp is limited when considering the infiltration of excess river peak flow alone figs 9 11 in comparison the irrigation and snwt scenarios have a substantially larger potential and the three should be considered in combination the three management scenarios have not been evaluated in combination in this simulation study evaluating the summed impact of implementing all three types of management scenarios is not necessarily straight forward local effects from redirecting excess river water for mar could impact supply and demand of the groundwater resource the river water used for mar in this study is limited to excess peak flows why we assume that the spill over effects to the other management scenarios are limited impacts of the mar scenarios are largely unevenly distributed due to varying vicinity to rivers and upstream stormwater potential as indicated by the analysis of the wei river site the mar potential can be comparable to the other management scenarios locally and as such mar by stormwater infiltration could be a valuable water management option in such areas undoubtedly exploiting this potential will require substantial management infrastructures to secure infiltration of peak stormwater flows likewise the water quality of stormwater is a separate issue beyond the scope of this analysis the water source for mar is not restricted to excess river peak flow alone and additional sources like reclaimed water urban runoff etc could be considered to reveal the full potential for local groundwater recovery at the mar sites the model parameterization of the hydrogeology could be refined to reveal more detailed local impacts on the groundwater system but this has not been the focus of this study instead the focus has been on analyzing integrated management solutions to the ncp water shortage considering both small and large scale solutions the current study on water management scenarios is limited to what if scenarios for the period 2000 2013 without inclusion of additional drivers such as changes in population and water demands or climate the focus has been on establishing the best possible hydrological dataset and model for describing the distributed water resource of the ncp for the study period potentially climate change and changes in demand will increase the pressure on groundwater resources in the ncp which has been investigated in other studies qin et al 2019 from the mar scenario perspective climate change induced increases in stormwater peak flow could increase the mar infiltration potential however this analysis should be seen in the context of other climate change impacts such as increased irrigation demand and general changes in precipitation recent studies have documented an increased water use efficiency wue in the ncp koch et al 2020 liu et al 2015 mo et al 2017 indicating that irrigation water consumption reductions in the order of 10 20 might be realistic while maintaining the current crop production other studies have however described the irrigation efficiency paradox where efficiency improvements are countered by increase in production to the level of previous water consumption grafton et al 2018 this illustrates the strong need for a combined effort on irrigation efficiently crop selection and legislation to effectively reduce water consumption in the ncp 5 conclusion compared to previous modeling studies on the ncp the current study has made improvements to major water balance components especially regarding their spatial distribution these improvements include spatially distributed water demand maps and better boundary conditions for both surface and groundwater flow from the upstream mountains of the haihe region in addition detailed spatial maps of irrigation water consumption from a recent study koch et al 2020 has been utilized to improve the quantification of irrigation which is the major anthropogenic control of the water balance across the ncp the hydrological modeling work has been performed in a multi objective uncertainty framework where five different data sources have been exploited in guiding model parameter optimization the optimization resulted in a range of plausible parameter sets representing the trade offs between calibration targets and finally a subset of 15 non dominated solution was chosen to represent an ensemble of parameter sets that can shed light on the impact of parameter uncertainties the modeling on historical data resulted in an estimated ensemble mean storage change for the ncp of 55 mm y 2000 2013 tradeoff between objective functions was however substantial and parameter sets resulting in the lowest error for the groundwater head trend objective function gwtrend suggested storage change rates of around 25 mm y the model ensemble was subsequently utilized for assessing impacts of different water management scenarios these illustrated that at the scale of the ncp mar in the form of infiltration of excess river peak flow volumes has relatively little impact in comparison to reduction in irrigation or expansion of the south north water transfer however for a local region in the piedmont area along the western boundary of the basin mar could have a substantial impact on local groundwater resources comparable to major water management strategies such as reduction in irrigation and increased in inter basin water transfers
