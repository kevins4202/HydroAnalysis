15085,lakes are sentinels of environmental changes within their watersheds including those induced by a changing climate and anthropogenic activities in particular contamination originating from point or non point sources nps within watersheds might be reflected in changes in the bacterial composition of lake water we assessed the abundance of potentially pathogenic bacteria ppb sampled in 413 lakes within 8 southern canadian ecozones that represent a wide diversity of lakes and watershed land use the study objectives were 1 to explore the diversity of ppb 2 to build a fecal multi indicator from a cluster of co occurring ppb and 3 to predict the fecal multi indicator over thousands of lakes we identified bacterial taxa based on 16s rrna amplicon sequencing and clustered 33 ppb matching taxa in the canadian epathogen database using a sørensen dissimilarity index on binary data across the sampled lakes one cluster contained erysipelothrix desulfovibrio bacteroides vibrio and acholeplasma and was related to the nps fraction of agriculture and pasture within the watershed as its main driver and thus it was determined as the fecal multi indicator we subsequently developed a fecal multi indicator predictive model across 200 212 southern canadian lakes which explained 55 1 of the deviance mapping the predictions showed higher fecal multi indicator abundances in the prairies and boreal plains compared to the other ecozones these results represent the first attempt to map a potential fecal multi indicator at the continental scale which may be further improved in the future lastly the study demonstrates the capacity of a multi disciplinary approach leveraging both datasets derived from remote sensing and dna sequencing to provide mapping information for public

surface runoff or directly from wastewaters pathogens originating from fecal contamination might cause waterborne diseases and can be linked to various non point sources nps of pollution from anthropogenic activities i e agriculture using manure livestock and untreated human wastewater and or wildlife and waterfowls vogel et al 2007 in freshwater ecosystems total coliforms and enterococci and specifically e coli are traditionally and commonly used fecal indicators but monitoring of these limited groups has been widely criticized as they do not represent the wide diversity of enteric pathogens schwab 2007 wu et al 2011 moreover contamination from fecal nps is often difficult to assess in recreational waterbodies and many studies show no correlation between nps and traditional fecal indicators schwab 2007 fecal contamination from nps is typically low discontinuous in time and is a heterogeneous signal that fluctuates greatly with precipitation curriero et al 2001 in addition the study of fecal contamination in water involves sampling and culture based analysis on growth media that is labor intensive and preferably performed on lakes with high recreational activities however many lakes that do not have recreational facilities might also be accessible to the public and pose a risk for human health studies have listed various potential microbial indicators as well as chemical tracers to detect fecal contamination in nps impacted waters haack et al 2009 tran et al 2019 these results suggested that using only one indicator is often insufficient to track fecal contamination whereas some chemicals and genes can trace specific sources back to their hosts e g stx1 stx2 and stx2c genes associated with cattle thus utilizing pathogenic multi indicators i e assessing several pathogens simultaneously may better capture the heterogeneity of fecal contamination ishii et al 2014 satellites and in situ sensors collect constant information that might serve as proxies of enteric microbial contamination for example data collected on agricultural and urban areas can reflect fecal nps precipitation level can indicate the effects of surface runoffs and bio optical variables including uv attenuation can inform on the growth conditions of bacteria dila et al 2018 oliva et al 2022 the use of both remote sensing bio optical and land use

marechal et al 2008 canada harbors 20 of the world s freshwater resources and 50 of the world s lakes distributed over nearly 10 million km² cott et al 2016 behind these numbers there is a wide diversity of lakes from near pristine deep oligotrophic mountain lakes to shallow eutrophic prairie lakes heavily impacted by oil and gas exploitation this study explores the diversity of potentially pathogenic bacteria ppb found in 413 canadian lakes with a specific focus on ppb potentially related to fecal nps here 1 we identified groups of ppb using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing followed by a clustering approach based on distribution across lakes 2 we identified the most important satellite derived and geospatial variables associated with the abundance of ppb clusters 3 we identified the ppb cluster most related to fecal nps that will serve as a fecal multi indicator 4 we developed a boosted regression tree brt model to infer fecal multi indicator abundance and lastly 5 we applied the model to 200 000 lakes in southern canada to predict fecal multi indicator abundance at large scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and data collection we sampled 413 lakes once either in the summer of 2017 or 2018 june september in southern canadian ecozones as part of the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada nserc lake pulse network huot et al 2019 to ensure the representation of a wide diversity of lakes the selection process involved a stratified random selection based on the ecozone i e ecological regions the size of the lake and a calculated human impact

watershed at each lake surface water was collected above the deepest point of each lake and pre filtered through a 100 µm mesh from this sample up to 500 ml of water was filtered using a 0 22 µm

water filtered through a 0 45 µm syringe filter the bottle was wrapped in aluminum foil and stored at 4 c all samples were stored at the required temperatures on the sampling day until their transfer

inference taxonomic assignment and rarefaction primer sequences were removed in cutadapt v 3 1 martin 2011 r v 4 1 2 was used for all subsequent analyses r core team 2021 trimmed reads were processed into amplicon sequence variants asvs using the dada2 pipeline v 1 16 which consisted of trimming low quality positions from the 3 ends of forward and reverse reads inferring asvs based on machine learned sequencing error rates merging paired reads and removing chimeric contigs callahan et al 2016 asv inference was performed across pooled samples using otherwise default parameters taxonomy was assigned in taxass which classified asvs against the freshtrain v 2020 06 15 database which is curated for freshwater bacteria and the silva v 138 reference database rohwer et al 2018 asvs were aligned in sina v 1 7 2 pruesse et al 2012 against the silva 138 1 ssu ref nr 99 rrna gene database released august 27 2020 quast et al 2013 asvs with fragment lengths under 250 bp or over 260 bp were removed asvs not assigned at the kingdom rank or assigned to archaea eukaryotes or chloroplasts were removed samples totalling fewer than 10 000 sequences were removed to compare the bacterial diversity across lakes despite uneven sequence abundances across samples asv composition was randomly subsampled i e rarefied to the lowest sequence abundance across all samples i e 12 139 sequences using the function rrarefy as implemented in the vegan package oksanen 2019 2 2 4 clusters of potentially pathogenic bacteria fecal contamination originating from nps usually has a low and noisy signal which is difficult to model where the presence of an organism can be missed due to low concentration or temporal variability due to source fluctuation or other drivers such as weather to identify a stronger signal and mitigate this limitation instead of working with an individual indicator species we opted to identify a group of ppb i e identified as a cluster of pbb occurring in similar locations related to potential fecal contamination that might originate from nps to build clusters of ppb 1 we retrieved bacteria matching taxa within the epathogen database public health agency of canada 2021 from risk group 2 and above 2 we computed a distance matrix on the binary asv data with occurrences in between 5 and 95 of lakes i e removing very rare and very occurrent species using the r function dist binary from ade4 package gower and legendre 1986 and 3 we performed hierarchical clustering using the sørensen dissimilarity index function hclust from r stats package murtagh and legendre 2014 to build clusters of ppb co occurring within the same lakes for each cluster we summed the abundances i e rarefied counts of all the species and analysed the total abundances of several species for each cluster abundance outliers were determined to the 99 quantile lastly we identified the cluster most related to fecal contamination through two steps 1 we identified potential fecal ppb based on the literature and 2 we performed a statistical analysis see section 2 4 on the different clusters in relation to a set of environmental variables and subsequently selected the cluster most closely related to potential nps in the results the selected cluster was used as fecal multi indicator 2 3 quality control and upscaling of datasets we selected environmental variables that could be related to potential fecal nps transport and survival of the ppb within watersheds and lakes table 1 focusing on variables that would be available for thousands of lakes to this end we included variables obtained or derived mainly from publicly available datasets i e s 100 t a i r f a g r i p a s f u r b a n and ecozones as well as bio optical variables i e a c d o m 400 tss with a potential to be estimated in the future via remote sensing table s1 our approach used two types of datasets recovering variables from the same sources but with different processing methods the quality controlled qc dataset was made of sampled variables as well as manually verified and or corrected geospatial variables the upscaled dataset used slightly different approaches to obtain the environmental variables i e more automated watershed delineation both qc and upscaled datasets recovered the variables on the 413 sampled lakes to train brt models additionally the upscaled dataset collected variables from 200 212 lakes in the sampled ecozones i e prairies boreal plains boreal shield mixedwood plains atlantic maritimes atlantic highlands excluding the montane cordillera and semi arid plateaux as we did not have enough sampled lakes for those regions selected lakes were between 0 1 and 100 km² and we excluded those with potential watershed area or lake area boundary issues i e usually lakes with digital elevation model issues from the geomatics analyses tss and a c d o m 400 were directly sampled from 413 lakes and included in the qc dataset but not in the upscaled dataset while tss and a c d o m 400 are in principle retrievable from satellite sensors there is currently no validated bio optical algorithm enabling their estimations over thousands of small canadian lakes however the effect of both bio optical variables on microbial clusters might still be perceived through other environmental variables retrieved for modeling see section 3 2 while brt models are robust with respect to the correlation between variables we only kept variables for which the pearson correlation was below 0 7 fig s1 dormann et al 2013 and the generalized variance inflated factor gvif was below 2 table s2 for parsimony reasons 2 4 boosted regression tree models two types of brt models were developed and applied on ppb rarefied cluster counts i e abundance with poisson distributions the first type focussed on finding relationships between abundance of ppb clusters and the qc dataset of environmental variables from each watershed those models are referred to as qc we followed this step to identify the cluster with the closest relationships with potential fecal nps which was selected as the fecal multi indicator the upscaled model was only applied to the cluster selected as the fecal multi indicator from the upscaled dataset i e 200 212 lakes we extracted the variables for the 413 sampled lakes to develop a second poisson distribution model we refer to the model as upscaled because a full qc of the dataset was not possible this model was subsequently used to predict and map the bacterial multi indicator for the 200 212 lakes to map the upscaled results and improve legibility we used a hexagonal tessellation of 50 km² hexagons arcgis pro 2 6 0 esri 2020 the value per hexagon corresponds to the median of lake values within each hexagon for validation we used qc variables and qc model as references and compared the upscaled variables and upscaled model for the 413 sampled lakes for all the brt models we processed the data using the method developed in oliva et al 2022 and the gbm step function from dismo package elith et al 2008 in brief we first tuned the brt parameters i e bag fraction tree complexity and step size with a learning rate of 0 03 second we simulated 1000 brt bootstrapped samples with replacement using the best tuned parameters and a 10 fold cross validation lastly we extracted median prediction values and confidence intervals i e 2 5 and 97 5 along with model performances scripts used from sections 2 2 4 to 2 4 are available at https github com anoliva brt lakepulse 3 results 3 1 composition of ppb clusters using 43 594 16s rrna asvs 820 909 rarefied sequences in 413 lakes we retrieved 1 197 asvs matching 76 taxa contained in the epathogen database by keeping only species with occurrences above 5 and below 95 in the sampled lakes 33 ppb were retained for further analyses ppb were clustered into four groups according to their sørensen dissimilarity index clusters 1 and 3 were separated from cluster 2 and 4 at 1 5 dissimilarity degrees fig 2 a lower separations between clusters 1 and 3 occurred at 1 3 indicating more dissimilarity between the species of those clusters than the species of clusters 2 and 4 the rarefied asv counts within each cluster showed that clusters 2 157 occurrences and maximum 60 rarefied counts and 4 297 occurrences and 140 rarefied counts contained asvs with typically low abundances and low occurrences in the sampled lakes while clusters 1 347 occurrences and 767 rarefied counts and 3 409 occurrences and 1810 rarefied counts tended to contain asvs with higher abundances and occurrences fig 2b 3 2 environmental drivers of ppb clusters the qc models were used to determine the environmental drivers associated with each ppb cluster the highest deviances explained were found for cluster 2 59 9 followed by cluster 4 with 34 7 deviance explained cluster 1 with 29 9 and cluster 3 with 25 2 table 2 all the cluster models selected the climatological indicator t air as a main driver the three most abundant and occurrent clusters 1 3 and 4 were positively associated 22 4 27 8 and 32 of relative influence respectively while cluster 2 was negatively related 14 6 fig s2a bio optical variables were highly represented within the main drivers of clusters 2 3 and 4 tss was positively associated with cluster 2 26 7 and negatively related to cluster 3 16 3 a c d o m 400 was positively associated with cluster 4 31 9 ecozones were selected as significant predictors for clusters 1 and 2 with the western mountains 16 6 and the prairies 17 5 as ecozones with the highest predicted abundances respectively lastly cluster 2 was positively related to f a g r i p a s 19 9 while cluster 1 was negatively associated to f u r b a n 18 2 environmental variables selected for this model mainly originated from public datasets with continental scale availability this criterion limited the choice of variables that might be included or tested in our approach other environmental variables below a pearson correlation cutoff of 0 7 have been tested in preliminary brt models such as a l a k e z l a k e and c h l a fig s1a however they did not increase the amount of deviance explained and our analysis showed that their effects were partially explained by other variables already present in the dataset for example z l a k e was usually explained by s 100 while c h l a was explained by tss and the models could not distinguish the effects between these similar variables additionally bio optical variables i e tss and a c d o m 400 were unavailable at wider scale over 200 000 lakes tss was the most important driver of the fecal multi indicator i e cluster 2 abundance in the qc model thus removing it from the upscaled model could have lowered the predictive power however we observed that both a c d o m 400 and tss effects could be replaced by other environmental variables already present in the upscaled model there was only a small performance difference between the models this assumption was also verified by checking the deviance explained by the environmental variables i e s 100 t a i r f a g r i p a s f u r b a n and ecozones in brt gaussian models for tss 67 1 and a c d o m 400 52 9 table s3 f a g r i p a s and ecozones were the main drivers of both the tss gaussian model 27 and 19 9 relative influence respectively table s3 and fecal multi indicator upscaled model 41 7 and 36 6 relative influence respectively fig s2b therefore the effect of tss might be accounted in the upscaled model through these other drivers regarding a c d o m 400 since it was not an important driver of the fecal multi indicator qc model capturing its effect is less necessary nevertheless we may expect future predictions to be enhanced by the addition of bio optical estimates from remote sensing 3 3 fecal multi indicator selection selection of the fecal multi indicator occurred in two steps firstly we selected clusters with ppb composition most strongly related to fecal nps based on a literature review the low occurrence low abundance cluster 2 was the most related to fecal nps compared to the other clusters because all the ppb in this cluster may be linked to fecal contamination table 3 erysipelothrix desulfovibrio bacteroides vibrio and acholeplama bacteria are common human and or animal gastrointestinal species könönen et al 2015 tarr et al 2015 waites and taylor robinson 2015 wellinghausen 2015 cluster 4 is the second group most likely related to fecal nps with potential pathogens of fecal origin such as staphylococcus lactococcus and plesiomonas becker et al 2015 forsythe et al 2015 lastly the highly occurrent and abundant clusters 1 and 3 tended to be composed mainly of freshwater and or environmental species such as legionella edelstein and lück 2015 or aeromonas horneman 2015 therefore clusters 2 and 4 were potential candidates to be selected as fecal multi indicator secondly we determined the clusters with the closest relationship to potential fecal nps i e f a g r i p a s f u r b a n f a g r i p a s can be considered as a potential nps of fecal contamination through its correlations with the number of animal units within the watershed pearson correlation 0 75 fig s1a and the computed fraction of the watershed where manure was applied pearson correlation 0 84 in contrast f u r b a n is a proxy for human population density pearson correlation 0 85 cluster 2 had a higher deviance explained than the other clusters and depicted the only positive correlation with the fecal nps f a g r i p a s lastly the ecozones driver indicated that the prairies tended to have higher abundances of cluster 2 ppb than the other ecozones although prairies lakes are naturally shallower and more eutrophic the ecozone is also highly altered by farmland activities wilken 1986 that might be another indirect effect of fecal nps based on these results we selected cluster 2 as a fecal multi indicator for further analysis 3 4 validation of the upscaled data and model we modelled the abundance of the fecal multi indicator using the upscaled dataset using the qc dataset and model as references we assessed the reliability of the upscaled dataset and model over the 413 sampled lakes firstly the upscaled variables fitted against the qc variables showed high correlations with r squared between 0 96 and 1 fig 3 secondly the observed abundance of fecal multi indicator showed a hotspot in the prairies ecozone fig 4 a which was strongly detected by both qc fig 4b and upscaled model predictions fig 4c overall the qc model r² 0 49 deviance explained 59 9 seemed to have a better fit between observations and predictions and a higher deviance explained than the upscaled model r² 0 46 deviance explained 55 1 specifically the qc model tended to perform better at discriminating the abundance values between individual lakes in the prairies and boreal plains compared to the upscaled model which nearly classified all the lakes in the prairies above 2 rarefied counts however both qc and upscaled predictions failed to detect small variations in the remaining ecozones where all predictions were underestimated and below 2 3 5 upscaled predictions of fecal multi indicator abundances predictions of the fecal multi indicator in 200 212 lakes using the upscaled dataset are shown in fig 5 a and cis ranges width between 2 5 and 97 5 in fig 5b the predicted upscaled model abundances ranged from 0 to 56 rarefied counts compared to 0 to 60 in the 413 observations fig s3 lakes with abundances above 2 were mainly localized in the prairies and to a lesser extent in the boreal plains in the prairies 48 4 of the lakes were between 3 7 rarefied counts and 37 5 above 7 which is considerably higher than in the other ecozones table 4 in the boreal shield and atlantic maritimes 100 of lakes were classified below 2 the ci range corresponding to the degree of uncertainty for new predictions was between 0 and 310 rarefied counts importantly the ci range reflects the variability that is not captured by the models and does not necessarily correspond to the degree of representation of the ecozones the highest uncertainty was localized in the prairies boreal plains and mixedwood plains usually corresponding to the lakes with the highest f a g r i p a s in the watersheds in contrast the smallest ci range hotspots were observed in the boreal shield atlantic maritimes and atlantic highlands a horizontal line of 2 5 counts crossing the boreal shield was detected which is likely an artefact caused by the t a i r around 2 c as shown in fig s4d in fig s2b we also saw that predictions around 2 c tended to be much more spread out it likely arose from two lakes in that band of t a i r that showed higher observed abundances fig 4a 4 discussion in this study we leveraged continental scale dna based analysis of bacterial communities in situ measured bio optical variables and publicly available geomatics data to develop predictive models of fecal multi indicators in canadian freshwater lakes in a previous study we predicted the occurrences of potentially pathogenic eukaryotic parasites and microfungi in an overlapping set of canadian lakes oliva et al 2022 the current study extends the objective of the previous study toward assessing the potential of canadian lakes to act as sentinels for pathogenic contamination specifically from fecal nps origin we expect that the combination of large scale ecological datasets with satellite and in situ sensing of inland waters will expand the development and use of tele epidemiological applications and methods for freshwater resources in the near future 4 1 experimental and methodological limitations we sampled lakes at their deepest point which is not necessarily practical or relevant for a public health study as sampling conventionally occurs at the shoreline near fecal nps and or recreational areas kotchi et al 2015 turgeon et al 2011 however representative sampling at the deepest point of the lake is standard practice in many limnological studies hilton et al 1989 and data for this project were collected in the context of a wider lake research campaign huot et al 2019 where shore sampling was not possible due to logistical constraints moreover bias might have been introduced within the molecular genetic analysis workflows ppb absence from a lake may be due to 1 sampling limitations i e the species was present but we did not sample it within the volume of water filtered or the mass of dna extracted 2 molecular genetic analysis limitations i e the species dna was not amplified or sequenced due to pcr biases or sequencing effort or sequences were removed during data curation or rarefaction see fig s5a or 3 the species was truly not present at the site or time of sampling for these reasons we cannot distinguish true negatives from false negatives for rare species our clustering approach likely helped to decrease the effects of false negatives by compensating with bacteria defined by similar distributions i e co occurrences across lakes regardless environmental variables associated with the abundance of the ppb clusters should be interpreted with caution as they might be related to the most occurrent and abundant species within each cluster and not to all the species that composed the cluster fig s5b additionally ppb were identified through 16s rrna gene sequencing which cannot distinguish pathogenic species or strains at lower taxonomical levels janda and abbott 2007 mende et al 2013 however even in the absence of more targeted information on in situ pathogenicity we analyzed groups of ppb considered public health threats by the public health agency of canada phac and or the canadian food inspection agency cfia asvs were classified in risk groups 2 and above by epathogen which brings together human pathogens regulated by the human pathogens and toxins act and the human pathogens and toxins regulations and animal pathogens regulated by the health of animals act and health of animals regulations phac 2018 however in the future virulence genes or specific pathogenic species targeted by public policies may be interesting targets for a tele epidemiological approach 4 2 upscaled map considerations this work shows the first map of a ppb fecal multi indicator in lakes at large scale and within southern canadian ecozones the upscaled fecal multi indicator map fig 5 seemed to reveal abundance hotspots in highly agricultural and livestock impacted ecozones such as the prairies and boreal plains which overlap with densely agricultural regions of canada according to the ecumene governmental maps statistics canada 2016 we only detected a few discrepancies between the upscaled variables in comparison to the qc variables indicating that the upscaled dataset does not represent a significant source of errors fig 3 regardless we advise caution while interpreting this figure and would like to point out that values represented in the upscaled map used a hexagonal tessellation of 50 km² hexagons which calculated the median of lake values within each hexagon this method which helps us to better visualize the values over so many lakes could also hide more subtle variabilities between individual lakes moreover the upscaled model tended to overestimate ppb abundances in the prairies ecozone and to underestimate abundances in the other eastern ecozones the cis map fig 5b indicated high uncertainty associated with the predicted high abundance areas in the prairies and boreal plains and moderate uncertainty in the mixedwood plains this uncertainty appears to be associated with watersheds impacted by agriculture and pasture f a g r i p a s fig s4a which are also major drivers of the fecal multi indicator abundance even considering these limits we observe a general trend in the prairies and boreal plains lakes with proportionally higher fecal multi indicator abundances than in the other ecozones conversely underestimation was probably due to the low number of lake observations above 2 counts in the eastern ecozones as large as a dataset of 413 sampled lakes may appear this sample is not sufficient to capture some smaller variability among lakes and within each ecozone the brt machine learning approach used here is very sensitive to the size of the dataset and performance is generally poorer with small datasets fewer than 500 observations elith et al 2008 larger training data sets are needed to build more complex models that consider more specificity in the sample these small variabilities might also be improved by the addition of bio optical variables such as a c d o m 400 and tss which may have contributed to improve the performances of the qc model fig 4 overall the upscaled model predictions was able to capture the global patterns between ecozones but not the smaller variations between individual lakes 4 3 method capacity to support governmental policies land use and climate changes are modifying the geographic spreads of micro organisms including fecal pathogens through nps anthropogenic activities temperature precipitations and other environmental variables related to microbial sources transports or survival however monitoring this changing geographic distribution of fecal pathogens in thousands of lakes over a wide territory such as canada is not covered by current public health surveillance strategies kotchi et al 2019 terrestrial or inland water remote sensing and geomatics products that might serve as proxies of enteric microbial contamination could help to predict and map pathogens at large spatial scale and complement the traditional labor intensive sampling of fecal contamination at individual sites previous public health studies have developed predictive large scale maps over eastern canada for vector diseases linked to satellite observations lyme disease kotchi et al 2021 west nile virus moua et al 2021 our work is inspired by previous public health studies on fecal contamination in canadian lakes brazeau et al 2013 guy et al 2018 kotchi et al 2015 and is an attempt to broaden the scope of existing tele epidemiological prediction and mapping approaches in the future such mapped predictions could support government policies on water regulations food security and species conservation an operational model will require more efforts toward collecting environmental dna and variables in lakes at continental scale as well as more model calibration 5 conclusion a broad diversity of ppb were identified in 413 lakes samples across southern canadian ecozones using 16s rrna gene amplicon analysis fecal ppb with similar distributions as revealed by clustering analysis and related to the fraction of agriculture and pasture within the watershed were combined into a multi indicator the fecal multi indicator was mapped over 200 212 lakes within 6 ecozones at the canadian continental scale predictions might be improved by future bio optical satellite estimations while our model was able to capture global ppb abundance patterns between ecozones more efforts are required to build an operational model that can capture smaller variabilities between lakes future tele epidemiological research should investigate the capacity of such predictive work to support governmental policies as well as analyze other genes i e antibiotic resistance and or virulence genes to predict pathogens through direct satellite estimations authorship contributions ao built the

lakes within 8 southern canadian ecozones that represent a wide diversity of lakes and watershed land use the study objectives were 1 to explore the diversity of ppb 2 to build a fecal multi indicator from a cluster of co occurring ppb and 3 to predict the fecal multi indicator over thousands of lakes we identified bacterial taxa based on 16s rrna amplicon sequencing and clustered 33 ppb matching taxa in the canadian epathogen database using a sørensen dissimilarity index on binary data across the sampled lakes one cluster contained erysipelothrix desulfovibrio bacteroides vibrio and acholeplasma and was related to the nps fraction of agriculture and pasture within the watershed as its main driver and thus it was determined as the fecal multi indicator we subsequently developed a fecal multi indicator predictive model across 200 212 southern canadian lakes which explained 55 1 of the deviance mapping the predictions showed higher fecal multi indicator abundances in the prairies and boreal plains compared to the other ecozones these results represent the first attempt to map a potential fecal multi indicator at the continental scale which may be further improved in

anthropogenic activities i e agriculture using manure livestock and untreated human wastewater and or wildlife and waterfowls vogel et al 2007 in freshwater ecosystems total coliforms and enterococci and specifically e coli are traditionally and commonly used fecal indicators but monitoring of these limited groups has been widely criticized as they do not represent the wide diversity of enteric pathogens schwab 2007 wu et al 2011 moreover contamination from fecal nps is often difficult to assess in recreational waterbodies and many studies show no correlation between nps and traditional fecal indicators schwab 2007 fecal contamination from nps is typically low discontinuous in time and is a heterogeneous signal that fluctuates greatly with precipitation curriero et al 2001 in addition the study of fecal contamination in water involves sampling and culture based analysis on growth media that is labor intensive and preferably performed on lakes with high recreational activities however many lakes that do not have recreational facilities might also be accessible to the public and pose a risk for human health studies have listed various potential microbial indicators as well as chemical tracers to detect fecal contamination in nps impacted waters haack et al 2009 tran et al 2019 these results suggested that using only one indicator is often insufficient to track fecal contamination whereas some chemicals and genes can trace specific sources back to their hosts e g stx1 stx2 and stx2c genes associated with cattle thus utilizing pathogenic multi indicators i e assessing several pathogens simultaneously may better capture the heterogeneity of fecal contamination ishii et al 2014 satellites and in situ sensors collect constant information that

diversity of lakes from near pristine deep oligotrophic mountain lakes to shallow eutrophic prairie lakes heavily impacted by oil and gas exploitation this study explores the diversity of potentially pathogenic bacteria ppb found in 413 canadian lakes with a specific focus on ppb potentially related to fecal nps here 1 we identified groups of ppb using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing followed by a clustering approach based on distribution across lakes 2 we identified the most important satellite derived and geospatial variables associated with the abundance of ppb clusters 3 we identified the ppb cluster most related to fecal nps that will serve as a fecal multi indicator 4 we developed a boosted regression tree brt model to infer fecal multi indicator abundance and lastly 5 we applied the model to 200 000 lakes in southern canada to predict fecal multi indicator abundance at large scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and data collection we sampled 413 lakes once either in the summer of 2017 or 2018 june september in southern canadian ecozones as part of the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada nserc lake pulse network huot et al 2019 to ensure the

inference taxonomic assignment and rarefaction primer sequences were removed in cutadapt v 3 1 martin 2011 r v 4 1 2 was used for all subsequent analyses r core team 2021 trimmed reads were processed into amplicon sequence variants asvs using the dada2 pipeline v 1 16 which consisted of trimming low quality positions from the 3 ends of forward and reverse reads inferring asvs based on machine learned sequencing error rates merging paired reads and removing chimeric contigs callahan et al 2016 asv inference was performed across pooled samples using otherwise default parameters taxonomy was assigned in taxass which classified asvs against the freshtrain v 2020 06 15 database which is curated for freshwater bacteria and the silva v 138 reference database rohwer et al 2018 asvs were aligned in sina v 1 7 2 pruesse et al 2012 against the silva 138 1 ssu ref nr 99 rrna gene database released august 27 2020 quast et al 2013 asvs with fragment lengths under 250 bp or over 260 bp were removed asvs not assigned at the kingdom rank or assigned to archaea eukaryotes or chloroplasts were removed samples totalling fewer than 10 000 sequences were removed to compare the bacterial diversity across lakes despite uneven sequence abundances across samples asv composition was randomly subsampled i e rarefied to the lowest sequence abundance across all samples i e 12 139 sequences using the function rrarefy as implemented in the vegan package oksanen 2019 2 2 4 clusters of potentially pathogenic bacteria fecal contamination originating from nps usually has a low and noisy signal which is difficult to model where the presence of an organism can be missed due to low concentration or temporal variability due to source fluctuation or other drivers such as weather to identify a stronger signal and mitigate this limitation instead of working with an individual indicator species we opted to identify a group of ppb i e identified as a cluster of pbb occurring in similar locations related to potential fecal contamination that might originate from nps to build clusters of ppb 1 we retrieved bacteria matching taxa within the epathogen database public health agency of canada 2021 from risk group 2 and above 2 we computed a distance matrix on the binary asv data with occurrences in between 5 and 95 of lakes i e removing very rare and very occurrent species using the r function dist binary from ade4 package gower and legendre 1986 and 3 we performed hierarchical clustering using the sørensen dissimilarity index function hclust from r stats package murtagh and legendre 2014 to build clusters of ppb co occurring within the same lakes for each cluster we summed the abundances i e rarefied counts of all the species and analysed the total abundances of several species for each cluster abundance outliers were determined to the 99 quantile lastly we identified the cluster most related to fecal contamination through two steps 1 we identified potential fecal ppb based on the literature and 2 we performed a statistical analysis see section 2 4 on the different clusters in relation to a set of environmental variables and subsequently selected the cluster most closely related to potential nps in the results the selected cluster was used as fecal multi indicator 2 3 quality control and upscaling of datasets we selected environmental variables that could be related to potential fecal nps transport and survival of the ppb within watersheds and lakes table 1 focusing on variables that would be available for thousands of lakes to this end we included variables obtained or derived mainly from publicly available datasets i e s 100 t a i r f a g r i p a s f u r b a n and ecozones as well as bio optical variables i e a c d o m 400 tss with a potential to be estimated in the future via remote sensing table s1 our approach used two types of datasets recovering variables from the same sources but with different processing methods the quality controlled qc dataset was made of sampled variables as well as manually verified and or corrected geospatial variables the upscaled dataset used slightly different approaches to obtain the environmental variables i e more automated watershed delineation both qc and upscaled datasets recovered the variables on the 413 sampled lakes to train brt models additionally the upscaled dataset collected variables from 200 212 lakes in the sampled ecozones i e prairies boreal plains boreal shield mixedwood plains atlantic maritimes atlantic highlands excluding the montane cordillera and semi arid plateaux as we did not have enough sampled lakes for those regions selected lakes were between 0 1 and 100 km² and we excluded those with potential watershed area or lake area boundary issues i e usually lakes with digital elevation model issues from the geomatics analyses tss and a c d o m 400 were directly sampled from 413 lakes and included in the qc dataset but not in the upscaled dataset while tss and a c d o m 400 are in principle retrievable from satellite sensors there is currently no validated bio optical algorithm enabling their estimations over thousands of small canadian lakes however the effect of both bio optical variables on microbial clusters might still be perceived through other environmental variables retrieved for modeling see section 3 2 while brt models are robust with respect to the correlation between variables we only kept variables for which the pearson correlation was below 0 7 fig s1 dormann et al 2013 and the generalized variance inflated factor gvif was below 2 table s2 for parsimony reasons 2 4 boosted regression tree models two types of brt models were developed and applied on ppb rarefied cluster counts i e abundance with poisson distributions the first type focussed on finding relationships between abundance of ppb clusters and the qc dataset of environmental variables from each watershed those models are referred to as qc we followed this step to identify the cluster with the closest relationships with potential fecal nps which was selected as the fecal multi indicator the upscaled model was only applied to the cluster selected as the fecal multi indicator from the upscaled dataset i e 200 212 lakes we extracted the variables for the 413 sampled lakes to develop a second poisson distribution model we refer to the model as upscaled because a full qc of the dataset was not possible this model was subsequently used to predict and map the bacterial multi indicator for the 200 212 lakes to map the upscaled results and improve legibility we used a hexagonal tessellation of 50 km² hexagons arcgis pro 2 6 0 esri 2020 the value per hexagon corresponds to the median of lake values within each hexagon for validation we used qc variables and qc model as references and compared the upscaled variables and upscaled model for the 413 sampled lakes for all the brt models we processed the data using the method developed in oliva et al 2022 and the gbm step function from dismo package elith et al 2008 in brief we first tuned the brt parameters i e bag fraction tree complexity and step size with a learning rate of 0 03 second we simulated 1000 brt bootstrapped samples with replacement using the best tuned parameters and a 10 fold cross validation lastly we extracted median prediction values and confidence intervals i e 2 5 and 97 5 along with model performances scripts used from sections 2 2 4 to 2 4 are available at https github com anoliva brt lakepulse 3 results 3 1 composition of ppb clusters using 43 594 16s rrna asvs 820 909 rarefied sequences in 413 lakes we retrieved 1 197 asvs matching 76 taxa contained in the epathogen database by keeping only species with occurrences above 5 and below 95 in the sampled lakes 33 ppb were retained for further analyses ppb were clustered into four groups according to their sørensen dissimilarity index clusters 1 and 3 were separated from cluster 2 and 4 at 1 5 dissimilarity degrees fig 2 a lower separations between clusters 1 and 3 occurred at 1 3 indicating more dissimilarity between the species of those clusters than the species of clusters 2 and 4 the rarefied asv counts within each cluster showed that clusters 2 157 occurrences and maximum 60 rarefied counts and 4 297 occurrences and 140 rarefied counts contained asvs with typically low abundances and low occurrences in the sampled lakes while clusters 1 347 occurrences and 767 rarefied counts and 3 409 occurrences and 1810 rarefied counts tended to contain asvs with higher abundances and occurrences fig 2b 3 2 environmental drivers of ppb clusters the qc models were used to determine the environmental drivers associated with each ppb cluster the highest deviances explained were found for cluster 2 59 9 followed by cluster 4 with 34 7 deviance explained cluster 1 with 29 9 and cluster 3 with 25 2 table 2 all the cluster models selected the climatological indicator t air as a main driver the three most abundant and occurrent clusters 1 3 and 4 were positively associated 22 4 27 8 and 32 of relative influence respectively while cluster 2 was negatively related 14 6 fig s2a bio optical variables were highly represented within the main drivers of clusters 2 3 and 4 tss was positively associated with cluster 2 26 7 and negatively related to cluster 3 16 3 a c d o m 400 was positively associated with cluster 4 31 9 ecozones were selected as significant predictors for clusters 1 and 2 with the western mountains 16 6 and the prairies 17 5 as ecozones with the highest predicted abundances respectively lastly cluster 2 was positively related to f a g r i p a s 19 9 while cluster 1 was negatively associated to f u r b a n 18 2 environmental variables selected for this model mainly originated from public datasets with continental scale availability this criterion limited the choice of variables that might be included or tested in our approach other environmental variables below a pearson correlation cutoff of 0 7 have been tested in preliminary brt models such as a l a k e z l a k e and c h l a fig s1a however they did not increase the amount of deviance explained and our analysis showed that their effects were partially explained by other variables already present in the dataset for example z l a k e was usually explained by s 100 while c h l a was explained by tss and the models could not distinguish the effects between these similar variables additionally bio optical variables i e tss and a c d o m 400 were unavailable at wider scale over 200 000 lakes tss was the most important driver of the fecal multi indicator i e cluster 2 abundance in the qc model thus removing it from the upscaled model could have lowered the predictive power however we observed that both a c d o m 400 and tss effects could be replaced by other environmental variables already present in the upscaled model there was only a small performance difference between the models this assumption was also verified by checking the deviance explained by the environmental variables i e s 100 t a i r f a g r i p a s f u r b a n and ecozones in brt gaussian models for tss 67 1 and a c d o m 400 52 9 table s3 f a g r i p a s and ecozones were the main drivers of both the tss gaussian model 27 and 19 9 relative influence respectively table s3 and fecal multi indicator upscaled model 41 7 and 36 6 relative influence respectively fig s2b therefore the effect of tss might be accounted in the upscaled model through these other drivers regarding a c d o m 400 since it was not an important driver of the fecal multi indicator qc model capturing its effect is less necessary nevertheless we may expect future predictions to be enhanced by the addition of bio optical estimates from remote sensing 3 3 fecal multi indicator selection selection of the fecal multi indicator occurred in two steps firstly we selected clusters with ppb composition most strongly related to fecal nps based on a literature review the low occurrence low abundance cluster 2 was the most related to fecal nps compared to the other clusters because all the ppb in this cluster may be linked to fecal contamination table 3 erysipelothrix desulfovibrio bacteroides vibrio and acholeplama bacteria are common human and or animal gastrointestinal species könönen et al 2015 tarr et al 2015 waites and taylor robinson 2015 wellinghausen 2015 cluster 4 is the second group most likely related to fecal nps with potential pathogens of fecal origin such as staphylococcus lactococcus and plesiomonas becker et al 2015 forsythe et al 2015 lastly the highly occurrent and abundant clusters 1 and 3 tended to be composed mainly of freshwater and or environmental species such as legionella edelstein and lück 2015 or aeromonas horneman 2015 therefore clusters 2 and 4 were potential candidates to be selected as fecal multi indicator secondly we determined the clusters with the closest relationship to potential fecal nps i e f a g r i p a s f u r b a n f a g r i p a s can be considered as a potential nps of fecal contamination through its correlations with the number of animal units within the watershed pearson correlation 0 75 fig s1a and the computed fraction of the watershed where manure was applied pearson correlation 0 84 in contrast f u r b a n is a proxy for human population density pearson correlation 0 85 cluster 2 had a higher deviance explained than the other clusters and depicted the only positive correlation with the fecal nps f a g r i p a s lastly the ecozones driver indicated that the prairies tended to have higher abundances of cluster 2 ppb than the other ecozones although prairies lakes are naturally shallower and more eutrophic the ecozone is also highly altered by farmland activities wilken 1986 that might be another indirect effect of fecal nps based on these results we selected cluster 2 as a fecal multi indicator for further analysis 3 4 validation of the upscaled data and model we modelled the abundance of the fecal multi indicator using the upscaled dataset using the qc dataset and model as references we assessed the reliability of the upscaled dataset and model over the 413 sampled lakes firstly the upscaled variables fitted against the qc variables showed high correlations with r squared between 0 96 and 1 fig 3 secondly the observed abundance of fecal multi indicator showed a hotspot in the prairies ecozone fig 4 a which was strongly detected by both qc fig 4b and upscaled model predictions fig 4c overall the qc model r² 0 49 deviance explained 59 9 seemed to have a better fit between observations and predictions and a higher deviance explained than the upscaled model r² 0 46 deviance explained 55 1 specifically the qc model tended to perform better at discriminating the abundance values between individual lakes in the prairies and boreal plains compared to the upscaled model which nearly classified all the lakes in the prairies above 2 rarefied counts however both qc and upscaled predictions failed to detect small variations in the remaining ecozones where all predictions were underestimated and below 2 3 5 upscaled predictions of fecal multi indicator abundances predictions of the fecal multi indicator in 200 212 lakes using the upscaled dataset are shown in fig 5 a and cis ranges width between 2 5 and 97 5 in fig 5b the predicted upscaled model abundances ranged from 0 to 56 rarefied counts compared to 0 to 60 in the 413 observations fig s3 lakes with abundances above 2 were mainly localized in the prairies and to a lesser extent in the boreal plains in the prairies 48 4 of the lakes were between 3 7 rarefied counts and 37 5 above 7 which is considerably higher than in the other ecozones table 4 in the boreal shield and atlantic maritimes 100 of lakes were classified below 2 the ci range corresponding to the degree of uncertainty for new predictions was between 0 and 310 rarefied counts importantly the ci range reflects the variability that is not captured by the models and does not necessarily correspond to the degree of representation of the ecozones the highest uncertainty was localized in the prairies boreal plains and mixedwood plains usually corresponding to the lakes with the highest f a g r i p a s in the watersheds in contrast the smallest ci range hotspots were observed in the boreal shield atlantic maritimes and atlantic highlands a horizontal line of 2 5 counts crossing the boreal shield was detected which is likely an artefact caused by the t a i r around 2 c as shown in fig s4d in fig s2b we also saw that predictions around 2 c tended to be much more spread out it likely arose from two lakes in that band of t a i r that showed higher observed abundances fig 4a 4 discussion in this study we leveraged continental scale dna based analysis of bacterial communities in situ measured bio optical variables and publicly available geomatics data to develop predictive models of fecal multi indicators in canadian freshwater lakes in a previous study we predicted the occurrences of potentially pathogenic eukaryotic parasites and microfungi in an overlapping set of canadian lakes oliva et al 2022 the current study extends the objective of the previous study toward assessing the potential of canadian lakes to act as sentinels for pathogenic contamination specifically from fecal nps origin we expect that the combination of large scale ecological datasets with satellite and in situ sensing of inland waters will expand the development and use of tele epidemiological applications and methods for freshwater resources in the near future 4 1 experimental and methodological limitations we sampled lakes at their deepest point which is not necessarily practical or relevant for a public health study as sampling conventionally occurs at the shoreline near fecal nps and or recreational areas kotchi et al 2015 turgeon et al 2011 however representative sampling at the deepest point of the lake is standard practice in many limnological studies hilton et al 1989 and data for this project were collected in the context of a wider lake research campaign huot et al 2019 where shore sampling was not possible due to logistical constraints moreover bias might have been introduced within the molecular genetic analysis workflows ppb absence from a lake may be due to 1 sampling limitations i e the species was present but we did not sample it within the volume of water filtered or the mass of dna extracted 2 molecular genetic analysis limitations i e the species dna was not amplified or sequenced due to pcr biases or sequencing effort or sequences were removed during data curation or rarefaction see fig s5a or 3 the species was truly not present at the site or time of sampling for these reasons we cannot distinguish true negatives from false negatives for rare species our clustering approach likely helped to decrease the effects of false negatives by compensating with bacteria defined by similar distributions i e co occurrences across lakes regardless environmental variables associated with the abundance of the ppb clusters should be interpreted with caution as they might be related to the most occurrent and abundant species within each cluster and not to all the species that composed the cluster fig s5b additionally ppb were identified through 16s rrna gene sequencing which cannot distinguish pathogenic species or strains at lower taxonomical levels janda and abbott 2007 mende et al 2013 however even in the absence of more targeted information on in situ pathogenicity we analyzed groups of ppb considered public health threats by the public health agency of canada phac and or the canadian food inspection agency cfia asvs were classified in risk groups 2 and above by epathogen which brings together human pathogens regulated by the human pathogens and toxins act and the human pathogens and toxins regulations and animal pathogens regulated by the health of animals act and health of animals regulations phac 2018 however in the future virulence genes or specific pathogenic species targeted by public policies may be interesting targets for a tele epidemiological approach 4 2 upscaled map considerations this work shows the first map of a ppb fecal multi indicator in lakes at large scale and within southern canadian ecozones the upscaled fecal multi indicator map fig 5 seemed to reveal abundance hotspots in highly agricultural and livestock impacted ecozones such as the prairies and boreal plains which overlap with densely agricultural regions of canada according to the ecumene governmental maps statistics canada 2016 we only detected a few discrepancies between the upscaled variables in comparison to the qc variables indicating that the upscaled dataset does not represent a significant source of errors fig 3 regardless we advise caution while interpreting this figure and would like to point out that values represented in the upscaled map used a hexagonal tessellation of 50 km² hexagons which calculated the median of lake values within each hexagon this method which helps us to better visualize the values over so many lakes could also hide more subtle variabilities between individual lakes moreover the upscaled model tended to overestimate ppb abundances in the prairies ecozone and to underestimate abundances in the other eastern ecozones the cis map fig 5b indicated high uncertainty associated with the predicted high abundance areas in the prairies and boreal plains and moderate uncertainty in the mixedwood plains this uncertainty appears to be associated with watersheds impacted by agriculture and pasture f a g r i p a s fig s4a which are also major drivers of the fecal multi indicator abundance even considering these limits we observe a general trend in the prairies and boreal plains lakes with proportionally higher fecal multi indicator abundances than in the other ecozones conversely underestimation was probably due to the low number of lake observations above 2 counts in the eastern ecozones as large as a dataset of 413 sampled lakes may appear this sample is not sufficient to capture some smaller variability among lakes and within each ecozone the brt machine learning approach used here is very sensitive to the size of the dataset and performance is generally poorer with small datasets fewer than 500 observations elith et al 2008 larger training data sets are needed to build more complex models that consider more specificity in the sample these small variabilities might also be improved by the addition of bio optical variables such as a c d o m 400 and tss which may have contributed to improve the performances of the qc model fig 4 overall the upscaled model predictions was able to capture the global patterns between ecozones but not the smaller variations between individual lakes 4 3 method capacity to support governmental policies land use and climate changes are modifying the geographic spreads of micro organisms including fecal pathogens through nps anthropogenic activities temperature precipitations and other environmental variables related to microbial sources transports or survival however monitoring this changing geographic distribution of fecal pathogens in thousands of lakes over a wide territory such as canada is not covered by current public health surveillance strategies kotchi et al 2019 terrestrial or inland water remote sensing and geomatics products that might serve as proxies of enteric microbial contamination could help to predict and map pathogens at large spatial scale and complement the traditional labor intensive sampling of fecal contamination at individual sites previous public health studies have developed predictive large scale maps over eastern canada for vector diseases linked to satellite observations lyme disease kotchi et al 2021 west nile virus moua et al 2021 our work is inspired by previous public health studies on fecal contamination in canadian lakes brazeau et al 2013 guy et al 2018 kotchi et al 2015 and is an attempt to broaden the scope of existing tele epidemiological prediction and mapping approaches in the future such mapped predictions could support government policies on water regulations food security and species conservation an operational model will require more efforts toward collecting environmental dna and variables in lakes at continental scale as well as more model calibration 5 conclusion a broad diversity of ppb were identified in 413 lakes samples across southern canadian ecozones using 16s rrna gene amplicon analysis fecal ppb with similar distributions as revealed by clustering analysis and related to the fraction of agriculture and pasture within the watershed were combined into a multi indicator the fecal multi indicator was mapped over 200 212 lakes within 6 ecozones at the canadian continental scale predictions might be improved by future bio optical satellite estimations while our model was able to capture global ppb abundance patterns between ecozones more efforts are required to build an operational model that can capture smaller variabilities between lakes future tele epidemiological research should investigate the capacity of such predictive work to support governmental policies as well as analyze other genes i e antibiotic resistance and or virulence genes to predict pathogens through direct satellite estimations authorship contributions ao built the

immobilization results reveal that the adsorption capacities of tife chy for as iii and as v are considerably higher than the commonly used amendments i e layered double hydroxide ldh and phoslock respectively more importantly tife chy exhibits a strong anti interference capability of as immobilization in soils compared to those commercial products due to this unique incorporation approach fixed bed leaching experiments indciate that this tife chy nanoreactor can efficiently decrase the as iii and as v concentrations by 81 8 87 3 within a period of ten years significantly improving the long term stability of as immobilization in soils life cycle assessment analysis reveals that tife chy can reduce negative environmental impacts such as carbon emissions resulting in a low cost for soils and groundwater remediation the findings of this work open a new avenue for sustainable heavy metal loid s remediation in groundwater and soils graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords arsenic chrysotile contaminant immobilization life cycle assessment iron hydro oxides data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction arsenic as contamination in surface water and soils is becoming increasingly severe from both natural and anthropogenic activities posing a significant threat to human health and food security sun et al 2022 arsenic is mainly present in the natural environment in the form of arsenite as iii and arsenate as v basu et al 2014 meanwhile the existence of as highly depends on ph conditions for example as iii exists as neutral h3aso3 when the solution ph is lower than 9 2 while the dominant species of as v are h2aso4 and haso4 2 at a wide ph environment li et al 2020 leading to a remarkable challenge for as remediation therefore it is imperative to develop effective measures for controlling as contamination in groundwater and soils chemical immobilization is one of the promising techniques for as contamination remediation through adsorption because of low cost and high efficiency tajudin et al 2016 xu et al 2021 recently iron based materials such as hematite goethite limonite siderite and magnetite have been extensively used in the remediation of as contaminated groundwater and soils mainly due to the fact that iron oxides have a strong chemical bonding ability to as ajith et al 2021 liu et al 2020a 2021 qiao et al 2018 however iron oxides tend to agglomerate during the preparation and result in insufficient adsorption sites and mobility in groundwater and soil diephuis et al 2022 meanwhile the presence of additional components in soils such as mineral colloids and organic matter will compete with as for the adsorption sites on the surface of iron oxides and subsequently hinder the direct interaction between as and the iron oxides this can reduce the capability of iron oxides for as immobilization zhang et al 2016 additionally the reduction of iron driven by soil microorganisms and the phase transformation of iron oxides can trigger immobilized as to be released again which leads to the insufficient long term stability of iron oxides for as immobilization xu et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 hence improving the immobilization efficiency and long term stability of iron oxides is an urgent problem to be solved for the remediation of as contamination to solve these problems studies have used substrates with high specific surface areas to improve the dispersibility of iron oxides such as carbon nanotubes ma et al 2018 biochar liu et al 2020a clay minerals song et al 2021 however dispersing iron oxides on the surface of substrates is still interfered by mineral colloids and organic matter in soils resulting in insufficient anti interference and low immobilization efficiency of heavy metals chrysotile is a type of naturally available silicate mineral with a hollow nanotubular structure lazaratou et al 2020 the silicon oxygen tetrahedron in the inner layer and the magnesium hydroxide octahedron in the outer layer is connected by covalent bonds resulting in a hollow structure that is very stable and provides a cylindrical cavity space with an approximate diameter of 10 nm foresti et al 2009 yu et al 2019 the unique tubular characteristics of chrysotile provide a possibility to load iron oxides on its inner cylindrical cavity space in addition to tackle the drawback of instability of iron oxides the incorporation of secondary metals such as titanium ti into fe lattices may improve the stability of iron oxides razani et al 2017 yalçın et al 2010 more importantly ti incorporated iron oxides show a great synergistic effect for as removal and the stability of iron oxides can be substantially improved zhou et al 2008 in this study a chrysotile based nanoreactor was prepared using a co precipitation method exhibiting a better long term stability and a high efficiency for as immobilization in soils and groundwater thus the specific objectives of this work are 1 to characterize the physicochemical properties and adsorption capacity of the chrysotile based nanoreactor 2 to examine the anti interference of this chrysotile based nanoreactor in soils and to reveal its immobilization mechanisms of as 3 to systematically investigate the long term stability of this chrysotile based nanoreactor for immobilizing as and 4 to assess the economic benefits and the environmental sustainability of chrysotile based nanoreactor the findings of this study provide new insights into the remediation of as contaminated groundwater and soils 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation and characterization of chrysotile based nanoreactor the detailed chemical reagents are provided in supporting information text s1 a modified version of the procedure described by zhan and co workers was used to prepare the chrysotile based nanoreactor zhan et al 2011 in brief the pristine chrysotile was washed three times to remove impurities the dried chrysotile 0 80 g was transferred to 400 ml of deionized water and sonicated for 20 min a total of 1 20 g fecl3 6h2o and 0 13 g tiso4 were dissolved in 40 ml of ultrapure water then the chrysotile was immersed in a fecl3 and tiso4 mixed solution which was then stirred at 40 c for 10 min subsequently to precipitate the surface immobilized fe3 10 nh4oh was applied dropwise the ph of the reaction mixture was kept at roughly 10 ensuring the complete conversion of fe3 to iron oxides next the acquired sample was washed three times and dried overnight at 60 c finally the samples were immediately transferred to a muffle furnace and heated at 350 c for 2 h the obtained powder was a chrysotile based fe ti nanoreactor named tife chy the characterization methods are provided in supporting information text s2 2 2 adsorption experiments in water all batch experiments were examined in the 50 ml centrifuge tube containing 20 mg adsorbents tife chy ldh and phoslock and 40 ml as solution the concentrations of as iii and as v were 20 mg l in adsorption kinetics experiments and maintained solution ph at 7 0 0 1 with 5 mm mops these centrifuge tubes oscillated at 200 rpm and 25 at certain sampling times the resulting solution was passed through a 0 22 μm membrane filter and the concentration of as was determined in addition the adsorption isotherms were conducted with an initial as concentration ranging from 10 to 250 mg l similarly the ph of the solution was kept constant at 7 0 0 1 using 5 mm mops then these solutions oscillated for 8 h and the resulting solution was collected for as concentration determination all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 3 batch experiments in soils to assess the anti interference capability of tife chy ldh and phoslock as immobilization kinetic experiments were conducted in soil suspensions in brief dried soil 4 g was mixed with three adsorbents tife chy ldh and phoslock at dosages of 0 5 g l and 40 0 ml of 20 mg l as iii or as v solution control experiments without adsorbents were also performed dissolved as iii and as v were collected at predetermined times 15 min to 8 h the anti interference value of different adsorbents can be determined according to the following equation eq 1 1 r r a r s r w where r is anti interference ra is the immobilization rate of as in the soil by the adsorbents rs is the immobilization rate of as in the soil without adding adsorbents rw is the removal rate of as in aqueous solutions by the adsorbents for investigating immobilization of as by tife chy in soil dried soil 3 g was placed in centrifuge tubes and 30 ml of 20 mg l as iii or as v solution was then added to the soil the tife chy ldh and phoslock were added to the soil at a rate of 5 w w control experiments without adsorbents were also conducted the centrifuge tube was placed in a shaker 200 rpm at 25 c for three days three duplicates of each treatment were carried out after the reaction dissolved and different soil extracted as were collected specifically a 0 5 m nahco3 solution with a soil to solution ratio of 1 25 w v was used to extract available as in soils woolson et al 1971 the immobilization performance was evaluated by utilizing the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure tclp and h2so4 hno3 leaching procedure for each step 10 ml h2so4 hno3 2 1 w w ph 3 20 or 20 ml ch3cooh ph 2 88 was added to the soil sample and the mixtures were shaken for 18 h at 100 rpm us epa 1992 liu et al 2012 after centrifugation the concentrations of as were examined after passing through a 0 22 μm membrane filter 2 4 leaching experiments to assess the long term stability of adsorbents for as immobilization in soil a fixed bed leaching device was used to simulate the leaching effect of the adsorbents on as immobilization in the as contaminated soil under simulated acidic rain and landfill conditions liao et al 2021 sulfuric nitric acid or tclp with 10 mg l as v represents as contained acid rain ph 3 and 5 and landfill leachate respectively dai et al 2013 usepa 1996 in this study long term stability performance over 10 years was simulated for example in the past ten years the guangdong provincial environmental status bulletin showed that the annual average rainfall was approximately 1863 45 mm and the average ph was 5 29 table s1 the simulation time and leaching solution volume were calculated using eqs 2 and 3 2 v q s 1 25 3 t v r where v is the volume of the leaching solution required to simulate one year ml q is average annual precipitation cm s is the elution column cross sectional area 1 0048 cm2 and r is the peristaltic pump speed 0 77 ml min considering the loss of surface runoff the loss was set to 25 liao et al 2021 in order to explore the long term stability of tife chy on as immobilization in different regions of china the whole country is divided into five regions of a1 a5 from the southeast to northwest of china according to the difference of precipitation in china the annual precipitation in different regions were shown in table s2 tife chy and phoslock were added to the sand soil mixture sand soil is 3 7 at a rate of 5 w w respectively then the leaching time and solution volume of different regions were calculated according to the given formula eqs 2 and 3 2 5 environmental sustainability assessment life cycle assessment lca was used to evaluate the environmental sustainability of the application tife chy for the remediation of as contaminated soil liu et al 2022a 2022b life cycle impact assessment was based the recipe method to evaluate the potential environmental impacts including ecosystems human health and resource consumption three aspects huijbregts et al 2017 a details description of the scenarios and environmental sustainability assessment process was listed in text s3 the lca inventory data were given in table s3 2 6 analytical methods the as iii and as v concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography coupled with atomic fluorescence spectroscopy elspe 2 prin cen inc china the fe ii concentration after the reaction was analyzed using a phenanthroline method on a microplate reader imark bio rad inc beijing china fang et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations of tife chy the micro morphologies of the as prepared chrysotile and tife chy were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy sem and transmission electron microscopy tem fig 1 a b results show that chrysotile exhibits a uniform hollow tubular structure fig s1a after doping with fe and ti multiple particles are well dispersed on the surface of tife chy fig 1a and the tem results show that significant amounts of nanoparticles have successfully entered the cylindrical cavity of chrysotile this result indicates that chrysotile can improve the dispersibility of iron oxide nanoparticles confining them into the inner cylindrical cavity a possible reason is that alkaline conditions can etch the inner layer of silicon dioxide during the synthesis of tife chy deb et al 2022 resulting in a slight increase in the cylindrical cavity diameter and facilitating the entry of iron oxides loading fe and ti on the surface and inner cylindrical cavity of chrysotile can be beneficial for improving the immobilization capacity and anti interference of tife chy in groundwater and soils meanwhile the results of the high angle annular dark field haadf tem elemental distribution also support that the observed ti and fe locates in the surface and inner cylindrical cavity of the chrysotile fig 1c this is with previous studies showing that fe3o4 nanoparticles can enter the hollow lumen of halloysite deb et al 2022 zheng et al 2015 additionally xrd was used to examine the crystal structures of chrysotile and tife chy fig 1d new peaks at 33 2 and 25 3 were observed in tife chy compared with chrysotile which can be attributed to the standard patterns of α fe2o3 pdf 33 0664 and tio2 pdf 21 1272 however the diffraction peak intensity of chrysotile in tife chy is significantly reduced owing to the dehydroxylation of tife chy during calcination the adsorption kinetic was conducted to investigate the as adsorption performance by tife chy and the ldh and phoslock that are avaiable in the commerical market were selected for comparison as shown in fig 1e f the as iii removal efficiency of tife chy is 54 3 which is obviously higher than that of ldh 36 4 and phoslock 26 5 respectively notably tife chy have a better as v removal efficiency 65 1 than that of as iii furthermore the adsorption kinetics of as iii and as v by tife chy ldh and phoslock were fitted with the pseudo second order and the r 2 was 0 98 0 99 fig s2a b table s4 indicating that chemisorption is likely the primary factor influencing the adsorption of as iii and as v by tife chy gao et al 2022 moreover the pseudo second order rate constant k 2 of as v adsorption by tife chy is 1 60 10 3 g mg min which is higher than that of ldh and phoslock of 1 18 10 3 and 9 47 10 4 g mg min respectively table s4 the higher k2 value for the removal of as v indicates that tife chy adsorbs as v considerably faster than as iii the adsorption isotherms were used to explore the adsorption capacity of tife chy ldh and phoslock for as as shown in fig s2c d and table s5 the adsorption isotherms of tife chy ldh and phoslock were well fitted by the langmuir model r 2 0 94 0 99 this suggests that the non uniform surfaces of tife chy ldh and phoslock dominate monolayer adsorption gao et al 2022 the langmuir model reveals that as iii and as v on tife chy have maximal adsorption capacities of 25 80 mg g and 44 43 mg g respectively table s5 these results demonstrate that the removal capacity and rate of tife chy are higher than those of ldh and phoslock the possible reason is that the surface area of tife chy is larger than that of ldh and phoslock which can provide more adsorption sites for as adsorption table s6 3 2 anti interference of tife chy to immobilize as to investigate the anti interference of tife chy in immobilizing as in groundwater soil particles were introduced to simulate the groundwater environment as shown in fig 2 a and b the concentrations of as iii and as v in different reaction systems decline dramatically within 120 min and then gradually stabilize after the reaction the immobilization efficiencies of tife chy for as iii 97 3 and as v 96 5 are higher than that of the ldh phoslock in addition the as immobilization kinetics data were fitted well with the pseudo second order kinetics model r 2 0 99 and the parameters are summarized in table s7 these results demonstrate that the adsorption process of tife chy is dependent on chemical adsorption fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir results show that an as v o group appears on the surface of tife chy fig s3a which indicates that hydroxyl groups on the surface of the tife chy can react with as to form a complex wu et al 2018 guo et al 2019 fig 2c shows that the removal rate constants k2 of as iii and as v in the presence of tife chy were 1 03 10 2 and 4 19 10 3 g mg min respectively which were also higher than those of the ldh phoslock and ck reaction systems fig 2c these results indicate that tife chy exhibites a stronger ability to immobilize as than ldh and phoslock in our simulated groundwater moreover to evaluate the anti interference performance of different materials for immobilizing as in soil suspensions the adsorption kinetic results in pure water were used as references to calculate the anti interference r value of each adsorbents as shown in fig 2d the r values of as iii and as v by tife chy are 0 10 and 0 07 respectively which are higher than that of ldh and phoslock these results suggest that tife chy have a stronger anti interference ability in groundwater than ldh and phoslock which can improve the immobilization of as the possible reasons for this are as follows the immobilization capacity of tife chy for as is higher than that of ldh and phoslock in aqueous solutions fig 1e and f this is possible because of that chrysotile as a candidate improves iron oxide dispersibility allowing a large iron oxide to react with as shao et al 2016 singh et al discovered that the large surface area of biochar could allow for well dispersed iron oxide exposing a significant surface area of iron oxide to the as iii aqueous solution and improving as adsorption singh et al 2020 more importantly partial fe and ti particles are likely to locate in the inner cylindrical cavity of the chrysotile fig 1c and as can enter the cylindrical cavity of tife chy and react with fe2o3 and tio2 which minimize soil particles interference for example deb et al successfully dispersed fe3o4 nanoparticles into the inner cavity of halloysite resulting in a greater adsorption capability than pristine halloysite for as deb et al 2022 thus the structural properties of tife chy indicate that there has a strong anti interference ability for the immobilization of as this result can also further prove that fe and ti oxides have been successfully incorporated into the inner cylindrical cavity of chrysotile to further study the mechanisms of as immobilization and anti interference by tife chy hr tem was used to analyze the morphology of tife chy after the reaction fig 2e shows that the spatial distribution paterns of fe ti and as are highly consistent which is likely ascribed to the formation of fe ti and as complexes and these can infer that part of as adsorb in the inner cylindrical cavity space of tife chy according to the above discussion fig 2g provides an illustration of the as immobilization mechanisms by tife chy arsenic can be immobilized mainly by surface complexation and electrostatic attraction with tife chy studies have shown that iron oxides and tio2 s surfaces contain abundant hydroxyl groups which are conducive to the formation of as iii as v fe ti complexes pena et al 2006 song et al 2021 tian et al 2015 accordingly as can form binary mixed oxides as bidentate mononuclear complexes or bidentate binuclear corner sharing complexes with hydroxyl groups on the iron oxide surface deb et al 2022 song et al 2018 moreover as can form bidentate binuclear surface complexes with the hydroxyl groups on the tio2 surface dutta et al 2004 pena et al 2006 as shown in fig s3a a new adsorption peak appeared at 829 cm 1 after the tife chy adsorbed as v which represents the stretching vibration of as v o liu et al 2020b this is solid evidence that as v forms complexes with hydroxyl groups on the surface of tife chy there is no obvious difference in xrd patterns after tife chy adsorbed as v which indicates that amorphous minerals are formed at the surface of tife chy after as v reacted with tife chy fig s3b in addition the points of zero charge pzc of tio2 and fe2o3 have been reported to be ph 6 8 0 2 and 8 0 1 0 respectively which can explain well with observed pzc value of tife chy is ph 7 9 dutta et al 2004 fernandez ibanez et al 2000 parks and bruyn 1962 notably h2aso4 is the primary form for as v under our experimental conditions hence this can favor a strong electrostatic attraction with positive charges on the materials surface at ph phpzc deb et al 2022 3 3 immobilization of as in soil by tife chy the immobilization stability of tife chy to as in soil was further studied as depicted in fig 3 the addition of tife chy ldh and phoslock significantly reduces the concentrations of dissolved nahco3 tclp and h2so4 hno3 extracted as the dissolved as iii and as v concentrations after adding tife chy decrease by 94 1 and 88 8 respectively which are higher than those after adding ldh and phoslock fig 3a and e previous studies have shown that the concentration of nahco3 as represents as bioavailability with a high mobility in soils wu et al 2018 among them the nahco3 as concentrations decrease by 57 3 21 4 and 34 6 after adding tife chy fig 3b d ldh and phoslock in soils with as iii respectively similarly the addition of tife chy results in a 74 1 reduction in nahco3 as concentration arsenic is mainly adsorbed by organic matters or minerals in soils hussain et al 2021 this result demonstrates that the addition of tife chy can effectively reduce the migration of as from soil surface to the solution and then can decrease the concentration of as in groundwater on the one hand adding tife chy can provide fe ti oh groups to soil and oh forms a complex with as which leads to a reduction of nahco3 as reducing the mobility of as wu et al 2018 on the other hand yan et al also discovered that iron oxides can transform specifically and non specifically adsorbed as fractions in soils into stable hydrated fe and al oxide bound as fractions yan et al 2020 which may further explain our results the concentrations of ch3cooh as and h2so4 as can represent as leaching from soils under the influence of acid rain and landfill leachate respectively as displayed in fig 3 the concentrations of h2so4 as and ch3cooh as in soils after adding three adsorbents are dramatically lowered and the concentrations of h2so4 as and ch3cooh as after tife chy treatment are found to be the the lowest the h2so4 as and ch3cooh as concentrations in tife chy treated soils decrease to 13 31 mg kg and 2 22 mg kg for as iii respectively in addition the addition of tife chy to the as v contaminated soil results in a low level of 1 mg kg for h2so4 as and ch3cooh as furthermore the immobilization performances are better by increasing tife chy dosage fig s4 previous studies have reported that fe2o3 can transform as from non specifically adsorbed and obligately adsorbed states to crystalline iron manganese or iron aluminum hydrated oxide bound states thereby reducing the leachability of as hu et al 2014 mansouri et al 2017 thus our results indicate that tife chy can effectively immobilize as in soils with a satisfactory chemical stability 3 4 long term stability of tife chy for as immobilization in soil long term stability is an important criterion for evaluating the developed adsorbents for sustainable soil and groundwater remediation we therefore simulated ten year as solution input through filter column experiments based on annual rainfall to evaluate the long term stability of tife chy fig 4 a the breakthrough curves of the different adsorbents absorbing as iii and as v are presented in fig 4b and c respectively with the addition of different adsorbents there is almost no leaching of as iii and as v in 3 5 years of the tife chy treatment while the cumulative leaching concentrations of as iii and as v increase gradually in the phoslock treatment the cumulative leaching concentrations of as iii and as v in the tife chy treatment are significantly lower than those in the ck and phoslock treatments compared to the ck the leaching concentrations of as iii and as v in the tife chy treatment decrease by 81 8 and 87 3 respectively this indicates that tife chy has a long term stabilizing advantage in as immobilization moreover the effect of ph was simulated the leaching concentrations of as iii at ph 3 and 5 were only 1 00 1 50 mg l in fig 4d indicating that tife chy is very stable and will not be affected by acid rain ph furthermore as iii leaching concentration decreases with the ph decrease demonstrating thata lower ph promotes as immobilization by tife chy the potential performances of tife chy in as spiked landfill leachate were further investigated using the tclp solution the cumulative leaching concentrations of as iii and as v are shown in fig 4e f the concentration of as iii in tife chy treatment is 2 14 mg l after the simulated 10 year leaching which decreases by 70 7 and 52 7 respectively compared to ck and phoslock the concentration of as v in the tife chy treatment is only 1 85 mg l which decreases by 76 8 and 64 0 respectively compared to ck and phoslock notably the fe ii concentration released into the solution is below 0 80 mg l fig 4g suggesting that tife chy has a good stability therefore this result indicates that tife chy exhibits strong long term stability for as immobilization in soil the influence of precipitation in different regions of china on the long term stability of tife chy for as immobilization was simulated according to the above results the removal and immobilization performances of tife chy on as v in aqueous and soil is better than that of as iii thus as v was selected as the leaching solution in this experiment as depicted in fig 5 the leaching concentrations of as v are reduced by 86 3 98 8 in five regions a1 a5 of china this result suggests that the long term stability of tife chy is applicable to different regions in china 3 5 environmental sustainability and cost efficiency analyses sustainable soil and groundwater remediation require a holistic consideration of the environmental impact during the remediation process the environmental sustainability of the tife chy remediation scenario was systematically evaluated based on lca and compared with the ldh and phoslock scenarios the results show that the environmental impact of the tife chy scenario is 5 86 pt pt is a standardized indicator that can indicate the total impact on the environment which is only 5 8 of the ldh and phoslock scenarios besides ecosystems human health and resources in ldh and phoslock scenarios are found to be 26 60 20 70 and 1 62 times higher than the tife chy scenario respectively therefore the application of tife chy in soil remediation has a lower negative impact on the environment the lcia midpoint results show that the tife chy scenario generates lower emissions such as co2 53 16 kg eq nox 0 32 kg eq and so2 0 20 kg eq compared with the ldh and phoslock scenarios table s8 the main reason is that the tife chy preparation process is facile which reduces energy and resource consumption these results indicate that the addition of tife chy for as contaminated soil remediation can decrease carbon emissions reducing carbon emissions is one of the goals of sustainable land management sims et al 2020 thus compared with ldh and phoslock the application of tife chy for remediation of as contaminated site soil is more conducive to promoting environmental sustainability fig 6 b shows the cost of adding three absorbents per hectare to achieve the same immobilization aim the tife chy cost for treating each hectare of as contaminated soil is only 8925 which is notably lower than that of ldh and phoslock this cost estimation suggests that tife chy offers tremendous application possibilities for the practical remediation of as contaminated soil and groundwater in summary tife chy offers enormous potential to advance sustainable remediation reduce carbon emissions and reduce costs 4 conclusion in this study a novel fe and ti doped chrysotile tife chy nanoreactor has been developed the maximum adsorption capacities of tife chy for as iii and as v reach 25 80 and 44 43 mg g at ph 7 0 respectively which are higher than the commonly used ldh and phoslock importantly tife chy exhibits a strong anti interference ability for as immobilization in soil suspensions compared with the commerical products like ldh and phoslock which is mainly attributed to the incorporation of fe and ti oxides into its inner cylindrical cavity fixed bed leaching experiment results indicate that tife chy has strong long term stability for as immobilization by simulating the input of as containing rainfall over ten years in addition the application of tife chy for as contaminated soil remediation can reduce the negative impact on the environment and decrease the cost thus the findings of this study provide a novel strategy for achieving efficient and sustainable remediation of as contaminated groundwater and soils declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

15086,iron based materials for arsenic as immobilization in practical groundwater and soil remediation suffer from a low removal capacity and an insufficient long term stability herein a unique chrysotile based nanoreactor has been developed by incorporating iron titanium oxides into the cylindrical cavity of chrysotile tife chy providing sufficient internal reaction sites for as immobilization results reveal that the adsorption capacities of tife chy for as iii and as v are considerably higher than the commonly used amendments i e layered double hydroxide ldh and phoslock respectively more importantly tife chy exhibits a strong anti interference capability of as immobilization in soils compared to those commercial products due to this unique incorporation approach fixed bed leaching experiments indciate that this tife chy nanoreactor can efficiently decrase the as iii and as v concentrations by 81 8 87 3 within a period of ten years significantly improving the long term stability of as immobilization in soils life cycle assessment analysis reveals that tife chy can reduce negative environmental impacts such as carbon emissions resulting in a low cost for soils and groundwater remediation the findings of this work open a new avenue for sustainable heavy metal loid s remediation in groundwater and soils graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords arsenic chrysotile contaminant immobilization life cycle assessment iron hydro oxides data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction arsenic as contamination in surface water and soils is becoming increasingly severe from both natural and anthropogenic activities posing a significant threat to human health and food security sun et al 2022 arsenic is mainly present in the natural environment in the form of arsenite as iii and arsenate as v basu et al 2014 meanwhile the existence of as highly depends on ph conditions for example as iii exists as neutral h3aso3 when the solution ph is lower than 9 2 while the dominant species of as v are h2aso4 and haso4 2 at a wide ph environment li et al 2020 leading to a remarkable challenge for as remediation therefore it is imperative to develop effective measures for controlling as contamination in groundwater and soils chemical immobilization is one of the promising techniques for as contamination remediation through adsorption because of low cost and high efficiency tajudin et al 2016 xu et al 2021 recently iron based materials such as hematite goethite limonite siderite and magnetite have been extensively used in the remediation of as contaminated groundwater and soils mainly due to the fact that iron oxides have a strong chemical bonding ability to as ajith et al 2021 liu et al 2020a 2021 qiao et al 2018 however iron oxides tend to agglomerate during the preparation and result in insufficient adsorption sites and mobility in groundwater and soil diephuis et al 2022 meanwhile the presence of additional components in soils such as mineral colloids and organic matter will compete with as for the adsorption sites on the surface of iron oxides and subsequently hinder the direct interaction between as and the iron oxides this can reduce the capability of iron oxides for as immobilization zhang et al 2016 additionally the reduction of iron driven by soil microorganisms and the phase transformation of iron oxides can trigger immobilized as to be released again which leads to the insufficient long term stability of iron oxides for as immobilization xu et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 hence improving the immobilization efficiency and long term stability of iron oxides is an urgent problem to be solved for the remediation of as contamination to solve these problems studies have used substrates with high specific surface areas to improve the dispersibility of iron oxides such as carbon nanotubes ma et al 2018 biochar liu et al 2020a clay minerals song et al 2021 however dispersing iron oxides on the surface of substrates is still interfered by mineral colloids and organic matter in soils resulting in insufficient anti interference and low immobilization efficiency of heavy metals chrysotile is a type of naturally available silicate mineral with a hollow nanotubular structure lazaratou et al 2020 the silicon oxygen tetrahedron in the inner layer and the magnesium hydroxide octahedron in the outer layer is connected by covalent bonds resulting in a hollow structure that is very stable and provides a cylindrical cavity space with an approximate diameter of 10 nm foresti et al 2009 yu et al 2019 the unique tubular characteristics of chrysotile provide a possibility to load iron oxides on its inner cylindrical cavity space in addition to tackle the drawback of instability of iron oxides the incorporation of secondary metals such as titanium ti into fe lattices may improve the stability of iron oxides razani et al 2017 yalçın et al 2010 more importantly ti incorporated iron oxides show a great synergistic effect for as removal and the stability of iron oxides can be substantially improved zhou et al 2008 in this study a chrysotile based nanoreactor was

preparation and characterization of chrysotile based nanoreactor the detailed chemical reagents are provided in supporting information text s1 a modified version of the procedure described by zhan and co workers was used to prepare the chrysotile based nanoreactor zhan et al 2011 in brief the pristine chrysotile was washed three times to remove impurities the dried chrysotile 0 80 g was transferred to 400 ml of deionized water and sonicated for 20 min a total of 1 20 g fecl3 6h2o and 0 13 g tiso4 were dissolved in 40 ml of ultrapure water then the chrysotile was immersed in a fecl3 and tiso4 mixed solution which was then stirred at 40 c for 10 min subsequently to precipitate the surface immobilized fe3 10 nh4oh was applied dropwise the ph of the reaction mixture was kept at roughly 10 ensuring the complete conversion of fe3 to iron oxides next the acquired sample was washed three times and dried overnight at 60 c finally the samples were immediately transferred to a muffle furnace and heated at 350 c for 2 h the obtained powder was a chrysotile based fe ti nanoreactor named tife chy the characterization methods are provided in supporting information text s2 2 2 adsorption experiments in water all batch experiments were examined in the 50 ml centrifuge tube containing 20 mg adsorbents tife chy ldh and phoslock and 40 ml as solution the concentrations of as iii and as v were 20 mg l in adsorption kinetics experiments and maintained solution ph at 7 0 0 1 with 5 mm mops these centrifuge tubes oscillated at 200 rpm and 25 at certain sampling times the resulting solution was passed through a 0 22 μm membrane filter and the concentration of as was determined in addition the adsorption isotherms were conducted with an initial as concentration ranging from 10 to 250 mg l similarly the ph of the solution was kept constant at 7 0 0 1 using 5 mm mops then these solutions oscillated for 8 h and the resulting solution was collected for as concentration determination all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 3 batch experiments in soils to assess the anti interference capability of tife chy ldh and phoslock as immobilization kinetic experiments were conducted in soil suspensions in brief dried soil 4 g was mixed with three adsorbents tife chy ldh and phoslock at dosages of 0 5 g l and 40 0 ml of 20 mg l as iii or as v solution control experiments without adsorbents were also performed dissolved as iii and as v were collected at predetermined times 15 min to 8 h the anti interference value of different adsorbents can be determined according to the following equation eq 1 1 r r a r s r w where r is anti interference ra is the immobilization rate of as in the soil by the adsorbents rs is the immobilization rate of as in the soil without adding adsorbents rw is the removal rate of as in aqueous solutions by the adsorbents for investigating immobilization of as by tife chy in soil dried soil 3 g was placed in centrifuge tubes and 30 ml of 20 mg l as iii or as v solution was then added to the soil the tife chy ldh and phoslock were added to the soil at a rate of 5 w w control experiments without adsorbents were also conducted the centrifuge tube was placed in a shaker 200 rpm at 25 c for three days three duplicates of each treatment were carried out after the reaction dissolved and different soil extracted as were collected specifically a 0 5 m nahco3 solution with a soil to solution ratio of 1 25 w v was used to extract available as in soils woolson et al 1971 the immobilization performance was evaluated by utilizing the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure tclp and h2so4 hno3 leaching procedure for each step 10 ml h2so4 hno3 2 1 w w ph 3 20 or 20 ml ch3cooh ph 2 88 was added to the soil sample and the mixtures were shaken for 18 h at 100 rpm us epa 1992 liu et al 2012 after centrifugation the concentrations of as were examined after passing through a 0 22 μm membrane filter 2 4 leaching experiments to assess the long term stability of adsorbents for as immobilization in soil a fixed bed leaching device was used to simulate the leaching effect of the adsorbents on as immobilization in the as contaminated soil under simulated acidic rain and landfill conditions liao et al 2021 sulfuric nitric acid or tclp with 10 mg l as v represents as contained acid rain ph 3 and 5 and landfill leachate respectively dai et al 2013 usepa 1996 in this study long term stability performance over 10 years was simulated for example in the past ten years the guangdong provincial environmental status bulletin showed that the annual average rainfall was approximately 1863 45 mm and the average ph was 5 29 table s1 the simulation time and leaching solution volume were calculated using eqs 2 and 3 2 v q s 1 25 3 t v r where v is the volume of the leaching solution required to simulate one year ml q is average annual precipitation cm s is the elution column cross sectional area 1 0048 cm2 and r is the peristaltic pump speed 0 77 ml min considering the loss of surface runoff the loss was set to 25 liao et al 2021 in order to explore the long term stability of tife chy on as immobilization in different regions of china the whole country is divided into five regions of a1 a5 from the southeast to northwest of china according to the difference of precipitation in china the annual precipitation in different regions were shown in table s2 tife chy and phoslock were added to the sand soil mixture sand soil is 3 7 at a rate of 5 w w respectively then the leaching time and solution volume of different regions were calculated according to the given formula eqs 2 and 3 2 5 environmental sustainability assessment life cycle assessment lca was used to evaluate the environmental sustainability of the application tife chy for the remediation of as contaminated soil liu et al 2022a 2022b life cycle impact assessment was based the recipe method to evaluate the potential environmental impacts including ecosystems human health and resource consumption three aspects huijbregts et al 2017 a details description of the scenarios and environmental sustainability assessment process was listed in text s3 the lca inventory data were given in table s3 2 6 analytical methods the as iii and as v concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography coupled with atomic fluorescence spectroscopy elspe 2 prin cen inc china the fe ii concentration after the reaction was analyzed using a phenanthroline method on a microplate reader imark bio rad inc beijing china fang et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations of tife chy the micro morphologies of the as prepared chrysotile and tife chy were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy sem and transmission electron microscopy tem fig 1 a b results show that chrysotile exhibits a uniform hollow tubular structure fig s1a after doping with fe and ti multiple particles are well dispersed on the surface of tife chy fig 1a and the tem results show that significant amounts of nanoparticles have successfully entered the cylindrical cavity of chrysotile this result indicates that chrysotile can improve the dispersibility of iron oxide nanoparticles confining them into the inner cylindrical cavity a possible reason is that alkaline conditions can etch the inner layer of silicon dioxide during the synthesis of tife chy deb et al 2022 resulting in a slight increase in the cylindrical cavity diameter and facilitating the entry of iron oxides loading fe and ti on the surface and inner cylindrical cavity of chrysotile can be beneficial for improving the immobilization capacity and anti interference of tife chy in groundwater and soils meanwhile the results of the high angle annular dark field haadf tem elemental distribution also support that the observed ti and fe locates in the surface and inner cylindrical cavity of the chrysotile fig 1c this is with previous studies showing that fe3o4 nanoparticles can enter the hollow lumen of halloysite deb et al 2022 zheng et al 2015 additionally xrd was used to examine the crystal structures of chrysotile and tife chy fig 1d new peaks at 33 2 and 25 3 were observed in tife chy compared with chrysotile which can be attributed to the standard patterns of α fe2o3 pdf 33 0664 and tio2 pdf 21 1272 however the diffraction peak intensity of chrysotile in tife chy is significantly reduced owing to the dehydroxylation of tife chy during calcination the adsorption kinetic was conducted to investigate the as adsorption performance by tife chy and the ldh and phoslock that are avaiable in the commerical market were selected for comparison as shown in fig 1e f the as iii removal efficiency of tife chy is 54 3 which is obviously higher than that of ldh 36 4 and phoslock 26 5 respectively notably tife chy have a better as v removal efficiency 65 1 than that of as iii furthermore the adsorption kinetics of as iii and as v by tife chy ldh and phoslock were fitted with the pseudo second order and the r 2 was 0 98 0 99 fig s2a b table s4 indicating that chemisorption is likely the primary factor influencing the adsorption of as iii and as v by tife chy gao et al 2022 moreover the pseudo second order rate constant k 2 of as v adsorption by tife chy is 1 60 10 3 g mg min which is higher than that of ldh and phoslock of 1 18 10 3 and 9 47 10 4 g mg min respectively table s4 the higher k2 value for the removal of as v indicates that tife chy adsorbs as v considerably faster than as iii the adsorption isotherms were used to explore the adsorption capacity of tife chy ldh and phoslock for as as shown in fig s2c d and table s5 the adsorption isotherms of tife chy ldh and phoslock were well fitted by the langmuir model r 2 0 94 0 99 this suggests that the non uniform surfaces of tife chy ldh and phoslock dominate monolayer adsorption gao et al 2022 the langmuir model reveals that as iii and as v on tife chy have maximal adsorption capacities of 25 80 mg g and 44 43 mg g respectively table s5 these results demonstrate that the removal capacity and rate of tife chy are higher than those of ldh and phoslock the possible reason is that the surface area of tife chy is larger than that of ldh and phoslock which can provide more adsorption sites for as adsorption table s6 3 2 anti interference of tife chy to immobilize as to investigate the anti interference of tife chy in immobilizing as in groundwater soil particles were introduced to simulate the groundwater environment as shown in fig 2 a and b the concentrations of as iii and as v in different reaction systems decline dramatically within 120 min and then gradually stabilize after the reaction the immobilization efficiencies of tife chy for as iii 97 3 and as v 96 5 are higher than that of the ldh phoslock in addition the as immobilization kinetics data were fitted well with the pseudo second order kinetics model r 2 0 99 and the parameters are summarized in table s7 these results demonstrate that the adsorption process of tife chy is dependent on chemical adsorption fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir results show that an as v o group appears on the surface of tife chy fig s3a which indicates that hydroxyl groups on the surface of the tife chy can react with as to form a complex wu et al 2018 guo et al 2019 fig 2c shows that the removal rate constants k2 of as iii and as v in the presence of tife chy were 1 03 10 2 and 4 19 10 3 g mg min respectively which were also higher than those of the ldh phoslock and ck reaction systems fig 2c these results indicate that tife chy exhibites a stronger ability to immobilize as than ldh and phoslock in our simulated groundwater moreover to evaluate the anti interference performance of different materials for immobilizing as in soil suspensions the adsorption kinetic results in pure water were used as references to calculate the anti interference r value of each adsorbents as shown in fig 2d the r values of as iii and as v by tife chy are 0 10 and 0 07 respectively which are higher than that of ldh and phoslock these results suggest that tife chy have a stronger anti interference ability in groundwater than ldh and phoslock which can improve the immobilization of as the possible reasons for this are as follows the immobilization capacity of tife chy for as is higher than that of ldh and phoslock in aqueous solutions fig 1e and f this is possible because of that chrysotile as a candidate improves iron oxide dispersibility allowing a large iron oxide to react with as shao et al 2016 singh et al discovered that the large surface area of biochar could allow for well dispersed iron oxide exposing a significant surface area of iron oxide to the as iii aqueous solution and improving as adsorption singh et al 2020 more importantly partial fe and ti particles are likely to locate in the inner cylindrical cavity of the chrysotile fig 1c and as can enter the cylindrical cavity of tife chy and react with fe2o3 and tio2 which minimize soil particles interference for example deb et al successfully dispersed fe3o4 nanoparticles into the inner cavity of halloysite resulting in a greater adsorption capability than pristine halloysite for as deb et al 2022 thus the structural properties of tife chy indicate that there has a strong anti interference ability for the immobilization of as this result can also further prove that fe and ti oxides have been successfully incorporated into the inner cylindrical cavity of chrysotile to further study the mechanisms of as immobilization and anti interference by tife chy hr tem was used to analyze the morphology of tife chy after the reaction fig 2e shows that the spatial distribution paterns of fe ti and as are highly consistent which is likely ascribed to the formation of fe ti and as complexes and these can infer that part of as adsorb in the inner cylindrical cavity space of tife chy according to the above discussion fig 2g provides an illustration of the as immobilization mechanisms by tife chy arsenic can be immobilized mainly by surface complexation and electrostatic attraction with tife chy studies have shown that iron oxides and tio2 s surfaces contain abundant hydroxyl groups which are conducive to the formation of as iii as v fe ti complexes pena et al 2006 song et al 2021 tian et al 2015 accordingly as can form binary mixed oxides as bidentate mononuclear complexes or bidentate binuclear corner sharing complexes with hydroxyl groups on the iron oxide surface deb et al 2022 song et al 2018 moreover as can form bidentate binuclear surface complexes with the hydroxyl groups on the tio2 surface dutta et al 2004 pena et al 2006 as shown in fig s3a a new adsorption peak appeared at 829 cm 1 after the tife chy adsorbed as v which represents the stretching vibration of as v o liu et al 2020b this is solid evidence that as v forms complexes with hydroxyl groups on the surface of tife chy there is no obvious difference in xrd patterns after tife chy adsorbed as v which indicates that amorphous minerals are formed at the surface of tife chy after as v reacted with tife chy fig s3b in addition the points of zero charge pzc of tio2 and fe2o3 have been reported to be ph 6 8 0 2 and 8 0 1 0 respectively which can explain well with observed pzc value of tife chy is ph 7 9 dutta et al 2004 fernandez ibanez et al 2000 parks and bruyn 1962 notably h2aso4 is the primary form for as v under our experimental conditions hence this can favor a strong electrostatic attraction with positive charges on the materials surface at ph phpzc deb et al 2022 3 3 immobilization of as in soil by tife chy the immobilization stability of tife chy to as in soil was further studied as depicted in fig 3 the addition of tife chy ldh and phoslock significantly reduces the concentrations of dissolved nahco3 tclp and h2so4 hno3 extracted as the dissolved as iii and as v concentrations after adding tife chy decrease by 94 1 and 88 8 respectively which are higher than those after adding ldh and phoslock fig 3a and e previous studies have shown that the concentration of nahco3 as represents as bioavailability with a high mobility in soils wu et al 2018 among them the nahco3 as concentrations decrease by 57 3 21 4 and 34 6 after adding tife chy fig 3b d ldh and phoslock in soils with as iii respectively similarly the addition of tife chy results in a 74 1 reduction in nahco3 as concentration arsenic is mainly adsorbed by organic matters or minerals in soils hussain et al 2021 this result demonstrates that the addition of tife chy can effectively reduce the migration of as from soil surface to the solution and then can decrease the concentration of as in groundwater on the one hand adding tife chy can provide fe ti oh groups to soil and oh forms a complex with as which leads to a reduction of nahco3 as reducing the mobility of as wu et al 2018 on the other hand yan et al also discovered that iron oxides can transform specifically and non specifically adsorbed as fractions in soils into stable hydrated fe and al oxide bound as fractions yan et al 2020 which may further explain our results the concentrations of ch3cooh as and h2so4 as can represent as leaching from soils under the influence of acid rain and landfill leachate respectively as displayed in fig 3 the concentrations of h2so4 as and ch3cooh as in soils after adding three adsorbents are dramatically lowered and the concentrations of h2so4 as and ch3cooh as after tife chy treatment are found to be the the lowest the h2so4 as and ch3cooh as concentrations in tife chy treated soils decrease to 13 31 mg kg and 2 22 mg kg for as iii respectively in addition the addition of tife chy to the as v contaminated soil results in a low level of 1 mg kg for h2so4 as and ch3cooh as furthermore the immobilization performances are better by increasing tife chy dosage fig s4 previous studies have reported that fe2o3 can transform as from non specifically adsorbed and obligately adsorbed states to crystalline iron manganese or iron aluminum hydrated oxide bound states thereby reducing the leachability of as hu et al 2014 mansouri et al 2017 thus our results indicate that tife chy can effectively immobilize as in soils with a satisfactory chemical stability 3 4 long term stability of tife chy for as immobilization in soil long term stability is an important criterion for evaluating the developed adsorbents for sustainable soil and groundwater remediation we therefore simulated ten year as solution input through filter column experiments based on annual rainfall to evaluate the long term stability of tife chy fig 4 a the breakthrough curves of the different adsorbents absorbing as iii and as v are presented in fig 4b and c respectively with the addition of different adsorbents there is almost no leaching of as iii and as v in 3 5 years of the tife chy treatment while the cumulative leaching concentrations of as iii and as v increase gradually in the phoslock treatment the cumulative leaching concentrations of as iii and as v in the tife chy treatment are significantly lower than those in the ck and phoslock treatments compared to the ck the leaching concentrations of as iii and as v in the tife chy treatment decrease by 81 8 and 87 3 respectively this indicates that tife chy has a long term stabilizing advantage in as immobilization moreover the effect of ph was simulated the leaching concentrations of as iii at ph 3 and 5 were only 1 00 1 50 mg l in fig 4d indicating that tife chy is very stable and will not be affected by acid rain ph furthermore as iii leaching concentration decreases with the ph decrease demonstrating thata lower ph promotes as immobilization by tife chy the potential performances of tife chy in as spiked landfill leachate were further investigated using the tclp solution the cumulative leaching concentrations of as iii and as v are shown in fig 4e f the concentration of as iii in tife chy treatment is 2 14 mg l after the simulated 10 year leaching which decreases by 70 7 and 52 7 respectively compared to ck and phoslock the concentration of as v in the tife chy treatment is only 1 85 mg l which decreases by 76 8 and 64 0 respectively compared to ck and phoslock notably the fe ii concentration released into the solution is below 0 80 mg l fig 4g suggesting that tife chy has a good stability therefore this result indicates that tife chy exhibits strong long term stability for as immobilization in soil the influence of precipitation in different regions of china on the long term stability of tife chy for as immobilization was simulated according to the above results the removal and immobilization performances of tife chy on as v in aqueous and soil is better than that of as iii thus as v was selected as the leaching solution in this experiment as depicted in fig 5 the leaching concentrations of as v are reduced by 86 3 98 8 in five regions a1 a5 of china this result suggests that the long term stability of tife chy is applicable to different regions in china 3 5 environmental sustainability and cost efficiency analyses sustainable soil and groundwater remediation require a holistic consideration of the environmental impact during the remediation process the environmental sustainability of the tife chy remediation scenario was systematically evaluated based on lca and compared with the ldh and phoslock scenarios the results show that the environmental impact of the tife chy scenario is 5 86 pt pt is a standardized indicator that can indicate the total impact on the environment which is only 5 8 of the ldh and phoslock scenarios besides ecosystems human health and resources in ldh and phoslock scenarios are found to be 26 60 20 70 and 1 62 times higher than the tife chy scenario respectively therefore the application of tife chy in soil remediation has a lower negative impact on the environment the lcia midpoint results show that the tife chy scenario generates lower emissions such as co2 53 16 kg eq nox 0 32 kg eq and so2 0 20 kg eq compared with the ldh and phoslock scenarios table s8 the main reason is that the tife chy preparation process is facile which reduces energy and resource consumption these results indicate that the addition of tife chy for as contaminated soil remediation can decrease carbon emissions reducing carbon emissions is one of the goals of sustainable land management sims et al 2020 thus compared with ldh and phoslock the application of tife chy for remediation of as contaminated site soil is more conducive to promoting environmental sustainability fig 6 b shows the cost of adding three absorbents per hectare to achieve the same immobilization aim the tife chy cost for treating each hectare of as contaminated soil is only 8925 which is notably lower than that of ldh and phoslock this cost estimation suggests that tife chy offers tremendous application possibilities for the practical remediation of as contaminated soil and groundwater in summary tife chy offers enormous potential to advance sustainable remediation reduce carbon emissions and reduce costs 4 conclusion in this study a novel fe and ti doped chrysotile tife chy nanoreactor has been developed the maximum adsorption capacities of tife chy for as iii and as v reach 25 80 and 44 43 mg g at ph 7 0 respectively which are higher than the commonly used ldh and phoslock importantly tife chy exhibits a strong anti interference ability for as immobilization in soil suspensions compared with the commerical products like ldh and phoslock which is mainly attributed to the incorporation of fe and ti oxides into its inner cylindrical cavity fixed bed leaching experiment results indicate that tife chy has strong long term stability for as immobilization by simulating the input of as containing rainfall over ten years in addition the application of tife chy for as contaminated soil remediation can reduce the negative impact on the environment and decrease the cost thus the findings of this study provide a novel strategy for achieving efficient and sustainable remediation of as contaminated groundwater and soils declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

15087,the photoinduced transformation of ferrihydrite is an important process that can predict the geochemical cycle of fe in anoxic environments as well as the fate of trace elements bonded to fe minerals we report that the photooxidation of sulfite by uv irradiation produces hydrated electrons super reductants which significantly promote ferrihydrite reduction to fe ii and so3 a moderate oxidant enabling its further oxidation to more crystalline fe iii products the experimental results show that the concentration of sulfite was key in influencing the rate and extent of surface bound fe ii formation which ultimately determined the distribution of individual products for example fitting of the mössbauer spectroscopy data revealed that the relative abundances of mineral species after 8 h of treatment in the uv sulfite systems were 41 9 lepidocrocite and 58 1 ferrihydrite at 2 mm so3 2 41 8 goethite 28 2 lepidocrocite and 29 1 ferrihydrite at 5 mm so3 2 and 100 goethite at 10 mm so3 2 the combined results of the chemical speciation analysis and the cd k edge exafs characterization provided compelling evidence that cd was firmly incorporated into the structure of newly formed minerals particularly at high sulfite concentrations these findings provide an understanding of the role of uv sulfite in facilitating ferrihydrite transformation and promoting cd stabilization in oxygen deficit soils and aquatic environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fe ii catalysis ferrihydrite transformation photoinduced reactive species cd immobilization advanced reduction process fe cycle data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction ferrihydrite is an important product that results from pyrite oxidation in the presence of water and o2 and it is a natural reservoir for heavy metals due to its relatively large surface area and abundant surface groups hiemstra 2013 liu et al 2021b michel et al 2007 shi et al 2021 under reducing conditions ferrihydrite is susceptible to reduction in a biotical or abiotic manner while releasing fe ii a reactive species adsorbed on the fe oxide surface subsequently inducing its structural transformation to more stable phases such as lepidocrocite goethite magnetite and hematite boland et al 2014 hansel et al 2005 larsen and postma 2001 lovley 1997 this naturally occurring process results in the release of adsorbed heavy metals from the primary hosts and their repartitioning in secondary minerals for example cd bearing ferrihydrite is subjected to mineral dissolution in the presence of fe ii which mobilizes cd and it is then immobilized by newly formed fe iii oxyhydr oxides due to surface binding and structural incorporation burton et al 2019 yan et al 2021 zhao et al 2022a zhou et al 2020 for several decades an understanding of the underlying reaction mechanisms and driving forces of this process has attracted considerable attention many studies have shown that the reductive dissolution of ferrihydrite in aqueous systems is facilitated by organics either chemically or more frequently microbially by bacteria under the anaerobic conditions aeppli et al 2019 chen et al 2015 dong et al 2020 in addition inorganic electron donors such as sulfide and sulfite in organic matter deficient environments are also important contributors to ferrihydrite reduction to fe ii ma and banfield 2011 saalfield et al 2009 schoepfer and lindsay 2022 the photoinduced reduction of ferrihydrite also plays a crucial role in the fe cycle of aquatic environments this process can be achieved through pathways including i fe iii reduction by photogenerated electrons from fe iii oxyhydr oxide semiconductors lv et al 2022 shu et al 2019 ii fe iii reduction by direct ligand to metal charge transfer lmct kong et al 2016 xing et al 2019 and iii fe iii reduction by indirect reactions with exogenous photoelectrons from coexistent semiconductors or with photoinduced o2 from the excitation of photosensitive natural organic matter under aerobic conditions shu et al 2019 xing et al 2019 of particular pertinence to this article is the investigation of the photoinduced reduction of ferrihydrite by hydrated electrons eaq or hydrogen radicals h a photoexcited super reductant produced from anaerobic environments which surprisingly receives limited attention in the literature based on the knowledge that sulfite stimulated by uv irradiation can produce eaq h chen et al 2022 li et al 2012 yang et al 2020b it is anticipated that this super reductant can be produced in natural environments containing sulfite for instance sulfite is an intermediate species that originates from the microbial oxidation of pyrite ma and banfield 2011 sim et al 2017 or the microbial reduction of sulfate li and bao 2021 lohmayer et al 2014 in acid mine drainage amd sites previous studies have shown that sulfite and other sulfoxy compounds are detectable at the micromolar to millimolar levels in amd sediments or solutions druschel et al 2004 ma and banfield 2011 moreover the coexistence of sulfite ferrihydrite heavy metals and uv in amd relevant environments is possible because i the metastable phases of ferrihydrite are also frequently found in the system of pyrite oxidation balistrieri et al 1999 sánchez españa et al 2005 ii ferrihydrite generally entraps a variety of heavy metals i e cd as cr pb cu etc hiemstra 2013 shi et al 2021 and iii solar irradiation can penetrate water in a depth of several meters and sediments with a thickness of several millimeters ciani et al 2005 liu et al 2021b these considerations stimulate in depth research to understand the behavior of uv sulfite induced ferrihydrite dissolution and transformation and its importance to fe geochemistry and the relevant mobility immobility of heavy metals therefore the objectives of the current study were to i demonstrate the phenomenon that the combination of uv light and aqueous sulfite is conducive to ferrihydrite transformation to more crystalline minerals which in turn affects the mobility of cd ii elucidate the mechanism governing the reduction dissolution and phase transformation in the uv sulfite system that is supposed to generate both reductive species e g eaq and oxidative species e g so3 and oh and iii identify the evolution of secondary minerals and their interactions with cd at the molecular level to achieve these goals a series of experiments were conducted with and without uv irradiation and in the absence and presence of sulfite at different concentrations electron paramagnetic resonance epr and scavenging tests were performed to examine the generation of reactive species and to reveal their roles in ferrihydrite transformation the extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs spectroscopy mössbauer spectroscopy and other physicochemical techniques were used to obtain information regarding the fe local structure in ferrihydrite and the

schwertmann and cornell 2008 briefly 1 m naoh was added dropwise to the solution containing 0 1 m fecl3 6h2o until its ph was titrated to 7 0 7 5 the resulting particles were centrifuged 8000 rpm 5 min and washed 6 times with di water and then re dispersed in di water by ultrasonic shaking the stock suspension was purged with high purity n2 for more than 2 h and then immediately transferred to an anaerobic glove box the mass concentration of ferrihydrite was calculated from the measured total fe concentration using the commonly used molecular formula fe5ho8 4h2o lepidocrocite was

dried to obtain goethite 2 3 experimental setup and sampling all the experiments were carried out under anoxic conditions with 0 5 g l 1 ferrihydrite and 5 mg l 1 cadmium in a buffer solution ph 6 8 composed of 50 mm 3 n morpholino propanesulfonic acid mops cd and ferrihydrite were equilibrated on a shaking bed in the dark and in the anaerobic glovebox 855 acb plas lab america for 24 h to ensure adsorption equilibrium according to the analysis of visual minteq no cd precipitation was formed under this condition the sodium sulfite with different concentrations 2 5 and 10 mm was added to the suspension and then the solution ph was adjusted to 6 8 by 6 m naoh and 1 m h2so4 quartz tubes of 50 ml were used to hold the suspension the sealed quartz tubes were taken from the anaerobic glovebox and immediately placed into a photochemical reactor in which the reaction was initiated the reaction lasted for 8 h at a power of 720 w the distance between the reaction suspension and the light source high pressure mercury lamp was 6 5 cm the wavelength of the excitation light irradiated on the reaction system was 300 400 nm and the light density at the reaction suspension was about 12 mw cm 2 the samples were taken from the photochemical reactor at regular intervals and immediately centrifuged for further chemical analysis after the centrifugation the liquid was filtered and collected with a syringe filter 0 22 μm for the aqueous cd concentration measurement the solid was extracted with 10 ml of 0 4 m hcl and the extractable liquid was chemically analyzed to determine the concentrations of adsorbed cd and adsorbed fe ii ford et al 1997 frierdich et al 2014 reddy et al 2015 the remaining solid was dissolved by adding 4 mol l 1 hcl after completely dissolving the liquid was further filtered and collected for an analysis of the content of structurally incorporated cd all the experiments were repeated in triplicate and the average results were recorded throughout the study the ferrihydrite transformation rate k was estimated from the following equation maillot et al 2011 michel et al 2007 zhao et al 2022a zhou et al 2020 1 k ln fe iii e x fe iii t t where fe iii

using the ferrozine analysis for the determination of dissolved cd the sample was diluted with 2 hno3 stored at 4 c and analyzed using an atomic absorption spectrometer aas pinaacle 900t perkinelmer usa the detection of limit of aas for cd was 2 μg l 1 the concentration of s iv was monitored using the modified 5 5 dithiobis 2 nitrobenzoic acid colorimetric method with a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2550 shimadzu kyoto japan the details for s iv concentration measurement are presented in text s1 prior to the physicochemical characterizations the solid products were collected with a syringe filter 0 22 μm freeze dried and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c if the test apparatuses were not immediately available this storage method has been widely reported in previous studies boland et al 2014 shu et al 2019 otherwise the freeze dried samples were promptly detected we should state that the phase transformation of the resultant minerals during storage did not occur because they were in the form of fe iii oxyhydr oxides the surface morphology of the solid samples was characterized using scanning electron microscopy sem merlin zeiss co germany the mineral phases of the selected solid samples were analyzed using an x ray diffractometer x pert pro mrd panalytical holland germany and cu kα radiation λ 1 5418 å 40 kv and 40 ma diffractograms were recorded in the 2θ range of 10 70 with a step size of 0 02 at a scanning rate of 2 min 1 the fourier transform infrared spectra ftir vertex 33 bruker germany were collected in the absorbance mode in the range of 450 4500 cm 1 with a

for collecting the xafs data and the corresponding analysis are depicted in text s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations of the structural evolution of the uv sulfite induced transformation of cd bearing ferrihydrite the xrd analysis was conducted to discern the variation in the crystallized structure of cd bearing ferrihydrite upon uv irradiation and the addition of aqueous sulfite which influences the rate and extent of ferrihydrite transformation and the resulting products fig 1 a shows that the diffraction peaks of 2 line ferrihydrite typically at 2θ of 33 and 61 displayed no detectable changes under the conditions of either uv alone or 10 mm so3 2 alone in stark contrast the combination of uv and sulfite after 8 h of aging induced the appearance of strongly crystalline peaks attributed to goethite pdf 00 29 0713 sheng et al 2020a signifying the interactive effect in promoting ferrihydrite transformation the occurrence of ferrihydrite transformation is closely linked to the concentration of sulfite and is dependent on the reaction time at a low concentration 2 mm so3 2 the transformation exhibited slower overall kinetics and resulted in the formation of lepidocrocite pdf 00 08 0098 sheng et al 2020a for instance the distinct emergence of the lepidocrocite peaks was observed until 8 h of reaction time fig 1b when the concentration of so3 2 increased to 5 mm obvious changes in the peak profile appeared at 6 h and the final product at 8 h was composed of goethite major and lepidocrocite minor fig 1c fig 1d reveals that increasing the sulfite concentration to 10 mm significantly enhanced the transformation kinetics as 3 h of reaction time led to a remarkable appearance of new diffraction peaks which were attributed to goethite these findings are in good agreement with the literature results regarding the fe ii catalyzed ferrihydrite transformation into secondary and more crystalline minerals boland et al 2014 liu et al 2007 pedersen et al 2005 the production rate of adsorbed fe ii and the subsequent oxidation rate of this species are believed to be the key factors determining the type of secondary minerals and the extent of their formation this point is discussed in later sections the difference in the functional groups of fe oxyhydr oxides before and after treatment by uv sulfite was explored using the ftir which also supported the dynamic evolution of the mineral phase in general the strong bands centered at 795 and 890 cm 1 together with a broad band at 640 cm 1 were attributed to the ftir spectra of goethite gotić and musić 2007 kahani and jafari 2009 lepidocrocite exhibits three bands at 554 740 and 1021 cm 1 corresponding to the fe o γoh out of plane and δoh in plane vibrations respectively lewis and farmer 1986 xiao et al 2017 fig 2 a clearly indicates that there was little change in the infrared spectra under the uv alone and dark sulfite conditions and that the characteristic features derived from goethite were visible in the sample after 8 h of treatment note that the absorption peaks at 1040 cm 1 were due to the existence of s o stretching of sulfur containing group in the buffer solution zhou et al 2022 as illustrated in fig 2b the addition of 2 mm so3 2 to the uv system provoked the appearance of typical bands assigned to lepidocrocite from 3 to 8 h of operation and their intensities increased over time the presence of 5 mm so3 2 led to a gradual emergence of characteristic bands corresponding to goethite which accompanied the formation of the lepidocrocite bands fig 2c fig 2d shows that the predominant bands were attributed to goethite in the uv system containing 10 mm so3 2 the vibration peaks were strengthened with prolonged time suggesting that the elevated amount of goethite formed over time it should be emphasized that the uptake of cd 10 mg g 1 at an initial cd concentration of 5 mg l 1 in the ferrihydrite did not visibly impact its transformation as is evident based on the observations that the time dependent xrd and ftir results of the ferrihydrite samples in the absence of cd were highly similar to those in the presence of cd fig s1 the sem analysis was performed to examine the differences in the mineral surface morphology during the phase transformation fig s2 shows the sem images of the as synthesized cd bearing ferrihydrite and the end products of the transformation under uv irradiation with the sulfite concentrations of 0 2 5 and 10 mm when sulfite was unavailable the solid surface appeared to be flocculent which resembled that of the initial ferrihydrite again supporting the role of sulfite in promoting phase transformation the sem image of the sample formed at 2 mm so3 2 exhibited a typical lamellar structure of lepidocrocite qafoku et al 2020 schwertmann and cornell 2008 both lamellar and needle like crystals were observed on the mineral surface after the reaction in the uv sulfite system with 5 mm so3 2 the addition of 10 mm made the needle like crystals prevalent on the surface conforming to the generation of goethite as the ultimate product of the fe ii catalyzed ferrihydrite transformation boland et al 2014 hansel et al 2005 a further understanding of the mineral transformation of cd bearing ferrihydrite at the molecular level was aided by the mössbauer spectroscopy and the fe k edge exafs spectroscopy characterizations remarkable variations in the mössbauer spectra figs 3a d were revealed between the samples after uv irradiation over 8 h and in the absence and presence of sulfite at different concentrations which is in good agreement with the xrd and ftir results the fitting results and relevant parameters are provided in table s1 the mössbauer spectrum of the mineral without the engagement of sulfite exhibited a six fold peak with the typical parameters of ferrihydrite is 0 46 mm s 1 qs 0 05 mm s 1 bishop et al 1993 the addition of 2 mm so3 2 led to a partial transformation of ferrihydrite into lepidocrocite is 0 42 mm s 1 qs 0 037 mm s 1 and the addition of 5 mm so3 2 yielded the appearance of secondary minerals including lepidocrocite is 0 52 mm s 1 qs 0 01 mm s 1 and goethite is 0 48 mm s 1 qs 0 13 mm s 1 increasing the concentration of so3 2 to 10 mm resulted in a complete ferrihydrite transformation to goethite is 0 44 mm s 1 qs 0 22 mm s 1 bishop et al 1993 meng et al 2022 thomasarrigo et al 2018 the relative abundances of the mineral species after illumination for 8 h in the aqueous sulfite solution were estimated from the fitting results 41 9 lepidocrocite and 58 1 ferrihydrite at 2 mm so3 2 41 8 goethite 28 2 lepidocrocite and 29 1 ferrihydrite at 5 mm so3 2 and 100 goethite at 10 mm so3 2 beyond the solid phase fe iii signals the peaks associated with adsorbed fe ii were also observed in the original spectra of samples with 5 and 10 mm so3 2 the relative content of adsorbed fe ii increased with the increasing sulfite concentration from 0 95 5 mm so3 2 to 4 46 10 mm so3 2 liu et al 2021a this indicates that the enhanced concentration of fe ii bound to the mineral is favorable to ferrihydrite conversion into goethite boland et al 2014 huang et al 2021 jones et al 2017 the fe k edge exafs spectra also provide solid evidence of successful ferrihydrite transformation in the uv sulfite systems and a dependence of the conversion proportion on the sulfite concentration as illustrated in fig 3e a negligible transformation of ferrihydrite occurred under the sulfite free condition with uv radiation after 8 h of reaction time likewise no conversion appeared with the addition of 10 mm so3 2 in the dark on the contrary the fe k edge exafs signals clearly changed in the uv sulfite solution based on the fitting results by referring to the standard curves of ferrihydrite lepidocrocite and goethite the phase fractions of these minerals in different solid samples after 8 h of radiation were quantified fig 3f specifically the proportions of ferrihydrite were 63 5 29 0 and 0 those of lepidocrocite were 36 5 21 7 and 0 and those of goethite were 0 49 3 and 100 corresponding to the as resulted solids under uv irradiation with 2 5 and 10 mm so3 2 respectively despite the slight differences in the exact values between the fitted results of exafs and the mössbauer analysis they displayed an identical trend with lepidocrocite as the intermediate product at a low sulfite concentration and goethite as the final product at a high sulfite concentration this behavior is similar to that reported for the transformation of fe iii oxides assisted by biogenic fe ii xiao et al 2018 3 2 mechanistic investigations on uv sulfite induced ferrihydrite transformation it has been documented that the rate of fe ii uptake and the solid bound fe ii concentration are important in determining which particular minerals form and at what rate with respect to fe ii accelerated ferrihydrite transformation to more crystalline products boland et al 2014 liu et al 2021a sheng et al 2020b likewise the time courses of adsorbed fe ii concentrations in all setups were recorded and their dependence on the initial sulfite concentration was evaluated fig 4 a shows that the rate and extent of solid associated fe ii formation were closely linked with the content of sulfite no solid associated fe ii was detectable in the absence of sulfite suggesting that no other reductants responsible for fe iii reduction were available in such systems a more rapid increase in the concentration of adsorbed fe ii was observed at 10 mm so3 2 and it mounted to the summit 9 02 mg l 1 within 20 min the relevant values associated with 5 and 2 mm so3 2 distinctly decreased to 6 25 and 3 33 mg l 1 respectively the order of the adsorbed fe ii concentration determined by the wet chemistry analysis was highly consistent with the results revealed by the mössbauer analysis the latter suggested relatively higher adsorbed fe ii values particularly at 10 mm so3 2 possibly due to the involvement of adsorbed fe ii and structural fe ii in the mineral it is expected that the reduction and dissolution of ferrihydrite were driven by hydrated electrons eaq photoexcited super reductants e 2 3 v vs nhe arising from the uv sulfite process li et al 2012 wacławek et al 2022 to confirm the effectiveness of eaq in promoting fe iii reduction the epr analysis and scavenging experiments were conducted distinct tempo eaq signals were observable fig 4b in uv sulfite whose intensities were significantly attenuated upon the addition of ferrihydrite after 1 min of irradiation increasing the operation time to 3 min completely extinguished the epr signals both no3 and no2 were selected as the quencher for eaq due to the extremely high rate constants of 9 7 109 and 4 1 109 m 1 s 1 respectively buxton et al 1988 wang et al 2022 fig 4c shows that the rate of ferrihydrite transformation was 0 115 h 1 in the uv system with 10 mm so3 2 and that the presence of no3 and no2 greatly inhibited the conversion of ferrihydrite these results corroborate the role of eaq in facilitating fe iii reduction it can also be observed in fig 4a that the adsorbed fe ii concentration first climbed and then dropped with the increasing time in the uv sulfite systems this profile indicates that fe ii oxidation accompanied the uv sulfite induced reduction of ferrihydrite which is in accordance with the observation of microbial ferrihydrite reduction dong et al 2020 previous studies have demonstrated that fe ii fe iii electron transfer at the iron oxide water interface occurs which accounts for the ultimate mineral transformation when additional fe ii was reacted with ferrihydrite boland et al 2014 handler et al 2009 for this fe ii catalyzed process the concentration of adsorbed fe ii is usually maintained at a relatively constant value sheng et al 2020b however in our case the content of solid associated fe ii substantially decreased with the increase in the duration e g from 9 0 mg l 1 at 20 min to 1 3 mg l 1 at 8 h it thus can be hypothesized that an alternative pathway should influence the oxidation of fe ii and the resulting fe iii oxyhydr oxide products to verify this a series of reference experiments were performed with the addition of external fe ii at different concentrations to the aqueous ferrihydrite systems fig s3 illustrates that the levels of adsorbed fe ii were comparable to those in the uv sulfite processes but they did not significantly vary during 8 h of operation despite the observations of ferrihydrite transformation lepidocrocite appeared to be the major crystalline mineral for all the investigated cases with an adsorbed fe ii concentration that varied from 3 0 to 10 5 mg l 1 as shown by the xrd results fig s4 this is different from the result that goethite was the predominant product in the uv sulfite systems at high sulfite concentrations moreover the presence of sulfite 10 mm so3 2 without the involvement of uv can result in the reduction of ferrihydrite evidenced by the release of fe ii and its adsorption on the solid surface as shown in fig s5 but it was ineffective in causing its conversion fig 1a this implies the importance of other possible oxidants having the capacity to convert fe ii into fe iii fig 5 a depicts the dmpo relevant epr signals detected in different systems which are suggestive of the presence of so3 another product resulting from the photolysis of sulfite li et al 2012 yang et al 2020a the uv sulfite system exhibited the strongest dmpo so3 intensities and the co existence of ferrihydrite alleviated the magnitude indicating the consumption of so3 likely by fe ii the addition of more amounts of fe ii further weakened the signals this proves the involvement of so3 in fe ii oxidation in addition fig s6 shows that no relevant signals were visible under the dark condition and that the intensities of the dmpo so3 patterns were positively correlated with the initial sulfite concentration the possibility of a reaction between so3 and fe ii was also evident based on the differentiation in the decay rate of sulfite between the aqueous systems in the presence and absence of ferrihydrite as illustrated in fig 5b the addition of ferrihydrite remarkably retarded the decline in the sulfite concentration and this inhibition effect was distinct for all the investigated systems these results are considered to be the regeneration of sulfite resulting from so3 induced fe ii oxidation it should be noted that no dmpo ho patterns were revealed in the uv sulfite system corroborating that insignificant amounts of ho were produced upon light irradiation fig 5c also shows that the addition of nb meoh and tba excellent scavengers preferentially reacting with ho huang et al 2017 liang et al 2020 did not alter the rate of ferrihydrite transformation which is indicative of a negligible role of ho in fe ii oxidation high valence fe species with a high oxidative capacity may be produced from the fe ii catalyzed fe iii mineral transformation system under anoxic conditions hua et al 2022 however the addition of dmso that can quench fe iv species liang et al 2020 apparently did not slow the conversion rate fig 5c suggesting that fe iv also has an inappreciable impact on fe ii oxidation to summarize the uv sulfite process initiated ferrihydrite transformation primarily involves two reaction steps i reduction and dissolution of fe iii at the ferrihydrite surface and ii uptake of fe ii by the solid and its subsequent oxidation to fe iii for the first step the photolysis of sulfite yields the formation of eaq and so3 eq 2 li et al 2012 the former species is a powerful reductant that triggers the reduction of surface bound fe iii to fe ii eq 3 a similar fe iii reduction can also be driven by sulfite itself eq 4 despite its relatively lower reducing capacity for the second step it is generally accepted that the electron transfer atomic exchange mechanism eqs 5 6 governs fe ii oxidation and recrystallization boland et al 2014 sheng et al 2020b however in our cases the contribution of so3 induced conversion of fe ii eq 7 should play a crucial role in the oxidation of surface bound fe ii to newly formed fe iii oxyhydroxides this reaction is thermodynamically favorable considering the higher value of e so3 so3 2 0 63 v vs she than that of e fe iii fe ii 0 18 vs she liu et al 2020 it should be stated that sulfite binding to the surface of ferrihydrite is a prerequisite step for eaq triggered fe iii reduction and so3 induced fe ii oxidation process because all the reactions are considered to take place at the surface the adsorption of sulfite by ferrihydrite was evident from the prominent ftir peaks e g at 1040 cm 1 in fig s7 that were assigned to s o stretching of sulfur containing group faguy et al 1996 moreover an increase in the sulfite concentration led to the increasing intensity of the characteristic peaks previous studies have also reported that sulfite can bind to fe iii via inner sphere complexation zhou et al 2018 the rate and extent of surface bound fe ii formed upon uv irradiation increased with the increase in the initial sulfite concentration ultimately determining the type of secondary minerals and at what rate they formed lepidocrocite production dominated at relatively low surface associated fe ii concentrations whereas goethite production was predominant at high surface associated fe ii concentrations the acceleration of ferrihydrite transformation and goethite formation was achieved by the elevated sulfite concentration 2 so3 2 hv so3 eaq 3 fe iii eaq fe ii 4 2fe iii so3 2 h2o 2fe ii so4 2 2h 5 fe iii ofe ii fe ii ofe iii 6 fe ii ofe iii h fe iii ohnew fe ii 7 so3 fe ii so3 2 fe iii new 3 3 repartitioning of cd upon uv sulfite induced ferrihydrite transformation ferrihydrite is a natural sink for cd ii in soils and aquatic environments due to its relatively high surface area and abundant surface hydroxyl groups and the transformation of ferrihydrite to more crystalline minerals significantly influences the speciation and mobility of cd maillot et al 2011 michel et al 2007 zhao et al 2022a zhou et al 2020 fig 6 a shows that the addition of 0 5 g l 1 ferrihydrite resulted in the removal of 58 3 of cd initial concentration of 5 mg l 1 after 24 h and the concentration of aqueous cd stabilized at 2 1 0 1 mg l 1 the long time uv irradiation slightly improved the adsorption of cd on ferrihydrite likely due to a slight increase in temperature note that the presence of sulfite at concentrations from 2 to 10 mm so3 2 substantially abated the concentration of cd in the aquatic phase by 90 fig 6b d the promoted cd adsorption was attributed to the formation of cd so3 ternary surface complexes on the fe iii oxyhydroxides which is in line with previous observations and evidenced by the increasing intensity of the ftir peak at 1115 cm 1 with the increase in the sulfite concentration fig s7 zhang and peak 2007 however cd adsorbed by ferrihydrite was released again as a consequence of mineral transformation under uv induced reducing conditions fig 6 depicts that the time dependent evolution of cd was clearly affected by the sulfite concentration and was closely linked to the relative proportions of secondary mineral phases at 2 mm so3 2 the apparent cd release with the increasing time was observed with the dissolved cd content increasing from 9 0 to 30 8 over 8 h the liberation of cd was greatly inhibited at higher sulfite concentrations at 10 mm so3 2 the 8 h of reaction time only led to an increase in the concentration of dissolved cd from 9 8 to 14 1 the difference in the amount of cd released can be explained by the different extents of ferrihydrite recrystallization and newly formed minerals the observation of a higher cd release at a lower sulfite concentration was considered to be correlated with the partial transformation of ferrihydrite to lepidocrocite which poorly adsorbs cd due to the low surface area zhou et al 2020 a lower cd release at increasing sulfite concentrations was attributed to the production of goethite which exhibits a stronger capacity for cd uptake shen et al 2022 previous studies have shown that the presence of so4 2 dramatically promoted cd adsorption on goethite via the formation of cd so4 ternary surface complexes zhang and peak 2007 this phenomenon has also been observed on ferrihydrite but it was not as significant as goethite swedlund et al 2009 to explore cd repartitioning in the solid fe iii minerals formed in the uv sulfite systems as a function of the sulfite concentration the contents of adsorbed cd and structural cd were measured by extraction using 0 4 m and 4 m hcl respectively liu et al 2016 reddy et al 2015 as illustrated in fig 6b d the concentration of structural cd exhibited a positive correlation with the extent of ferrihydrite transformed to lepidocrocite and goethite suggesting a strong association between cd and the newly formed crystalline minerals when the concentrations of so3 2 increased from 2 to 10 mm the proportion of structural cd dramatically increased from 8 2 to 35 1 the higher fraction of structural cd coexisted with crystalline minerals which indicates a lower potential risk of heavy metal dissolution to understand the enhanced immobilization of cd by the newly formed crystalline minerals at the molecular scale the bonding environment of cd was determined based on an analysis of the exafs spectra and their fourier transforms fig 7 a b respectively the 8 h treated samples in the uv sulfite systems at different sulfite concentrations were subjected to analysis as shown by the cd k2 weighted exafs spectra the third oscillation in the k space appeared at 7 2 å 1 for the cd bearing ferrihydrite sample zhao et al 2022a however this value associated with the transformation samples shifted to a positive peak location with a more pronounced effect observed in the case of 10 mm so3 2 at 7 6 å 1 this indicates the inclusion of cd into the structure of goethite during the uv sulfite initiated ferrihydrite transformation spadini et al 1994 zhao et al 2022a the shell by shell approach to exafs fitting see the detailed parameters in table s2 provided further evidence of the immobilization of cd upon treatment with uv sulfite particularly at high sulfite concentrations the first pronounced peak in the fourier transform of cd bearing ferrihydrite occurred at r δr 1 6 å uncorrected for phase shift which is attributable to the cd o shell comprising approximately six o atoms on average of 2 27 0 01 å from the cd atom which is consistent with previously reported values spadini et al 1994 yan et al 2021 however the exafs of the transformed products showed that the cd o distance declined to the value of 2 24 0 01 2 26 0 01 å implying the existence of cd doping in the secondary mineral structure spadini et al 1994 there were two other prominent backscattering peaks in the fourier transformed data which were well fitted with two cd fe shells for the untransformed sample the first and second cd fe shells had an interatomic distance of 3 23 0 04 and 3 40 0 04 å respectively suggesting that cd mainly existed as edge sharing complexes randall et al 1999 yan et al 2021 after a reaction time of 8 h under uv irradiation in the presence of 2 5 and 10 mm so3 2 the interatomic distance of the first and second cd fe shells was in the range of 3 10 0 01 3 15 0 03 å and 3 37 0 02 3 40 0 02 å respectively the apparent decrease particularly in the first cd fe shell suggests that cd was structurally doped into the secondary minerals zhao et al 2022a zhou et al 2020 moreover the increasing aqueous sulfite concentration led to an increase in the intensity of the cd fe peaks in the fourier transformed data again this is likely to be due to the incorporation of cd in the newly formed mineral burton et al 2020 mitsunobu et al 2013 likewise the coordination number cn of the cd fe shells significantly expanded as a result of uv sulfite treatment and increased with higher sulfite concentrations for example the cn of the first cd fe shell was 0 5 1 1 2 1 and 2 9 in relation to 0 2 5 and 10 mm so3 2 respectively this indicates that the transformation of ferrihydrite to lepidocrocite and goethite causes a tighter bonding between cd and minerals burton et al 2020 overall these data in combination with the abovementioned chemical analysis collectively and convincingly show that cd was incorporated into the lepidocrocite goethite structure possibly by replacing fe iii 4 conclusions our findings demonstrate that the activation of aqueous sulfite by uv irradiation significantly triggered the transformation of cd bearing ferrihydrite to more crystalline mineral products the concentration of sulfite added to the uv system was a key factor in determining the rate of the ferrihydrite transformation and the particular type of minerals formed lepidocrocite was found to be the dominant compound at a low sulfite concentration and goethite primarily existed at a high sulfite concentration the mechanistic studies revealed that eaq an extremely strong reducing species stemming from the uv sulfite system played an important role in driving the reduction and dissolution of ferrihydrite to fe ii which was subsequently adsorbed onto mineral surfaces the amount of surface bound fe ii markedly affected the transformation rate and its oxidation by so3 was considered to be the foremost pathway governing fe ii conversion to newly formed fe iii oxyhydroxides the combination of the chemical analysis and the cd k edge exafs analysis corroborated that an increasing proportion of cd was more stably bound to the secondary products particularly goethite by structural incorporation when the photoinduced transformation occurred at high sulfite concentrations the results strengthen our understanding of the role of photochemistry in predicting the geochemical cycle of fe in natural environments e g amd sites containing sulfite and thereby the fate of heavy metals that are associated with fe minerals moreover because sulfite has the benefits of abundant sources low toxicity and low cost the uv sulfite based advanced reduction process would be a promising and viable approach to immobilize heavy metals beyond its general recognition for eliminating a variety of persistent and toxic contaminants with high redox potential declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

15087,the photoinduced transformation of ferrihydrite is an important process that can predict the geochemical cycle of fe in anoxic environments as well as the fate of trace elements bonded to fe minerals we report that the photooxidation of sulfite by uv irradiation produces hydrated electrons super reductants which significantly promote ferrihydrite reduction to fe ii and so3 a moderate oxidant enabling its further oxidation to more crystalline fe iii products the experimental results show that the concentration of sulfite was key in influencing the rate and extent of surface bound fe ii formation which ultimately determined the distribution of individual products for example fitting of the mössbauer spectroscopy data revealed that the relative abundances of mineral species after 8 h of treatment in the uv sulfite systems were 41 9 lepidocrocite and 58 1 ferrihydrite at 2 mm so3 2 41 8 goethite 28 2 lepidocrocite and 29 1 ferrihydrite at 5 mm so3 2 and 100 goethite at 10 mm so3 2 the combined results of the chemical speciation analysis and the cd k edge exafs characterization provided compelling evidence that cd was firmly incorporated into the structure of newly

advanced reduction process fe cycle data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction ferrihydrite is an important product that results from pyrite oxidation in the presence of water and o2 and it is a natural reservoir for heavy metals due to its relatively large surface area and abundant surface groups hiemstra 2013 liu et al 2021b michel et al 2007 shi et al 2021 under reducing conditions ferrihydrite is susceptible to reduction in a biotical or abiotic manner while releasing fe ii a reactive species adsorbed on the fe oxide surface subsequently inducing its structural transformation to more stable phases such as lepidocrocite goethite magnetite and hematite boland et al 2014 hansel et al 2005 larsen and postma 2001 lovley 1997 this naturally occurring process results in the release of adsorbed heavy metals from the primary hosts and their repartitioning in secondary minerals for example cd bearing ferrihydrite is subjected to mineral dissolution in the presence of fe ii which mobilizes cd and it is then immobilized by newly formed fe iii oxyhydr oxides due to surface binding and structural incorporation burton et al 2019 yan et al 2021 zhao et al 2022a zhou et al 2020 for several decades an understanding of the underlying reaction mechanisms and driving forces of this process has attracted considerable attention many studies have shown that the reductive dissolution of ferrihydrite in aqueous systems is facilitated by organics either chemically or more frequently microbially by bacteria under the anaerobic conditions aeppli et al 2019 chen et al 2015 dong et al 2020 in addition inorganic electron donors such as sulfide and sulfite in organic matter deficient environments are also important contributors to ferrihydrite reduction to fe ii ma and banfield 2011 saalfield et al 2009 schoepfer and lindsay 2022 the photoinduced reduction of ferrihydrite also plays a crucial role in the fe cycle of aquatic environments this process can be achieved through pathways including i fe iii reduction by photogenerated electrons from fe iii oxyhydr oxide semiconductors lv et al 2022 shu et al 2019 ii fe iii reduction by direct ligand to metal charge transfer lmct kong et al 2016 xing et al 2019 and iii fe iii reduction by indirect reactions with exogenous photoelectrons from coexistent semiconductors or with photoinduced o2 from the excitation of photosensitive natural organic matter under aerobic conditions shu et al 2019 xing et al 2019 of particular pertinence to this article is the investigation of the photoinduced reduction of ferrihydrite by hydrated electrons eaq or hydrogen radicals h a photoexcited super reductant produced from anaerobic environments which surprisingly receives limited attention in the literature based on the knowledge that sulfite stimulated by uv irradiation can produce eaq h chen et al 2022 li et al 2012 yang et al 2020b it is anticipated that this super reductant can be produced in natural environments containing sulfite for instance sulfite is an intermediate species that originates from the microbial oxidation of pyrite ma and banfield 2011 sim et al 2017 or the microbial reduction of sulfate li and bao 2021 lohmayer et al 2014 in acid mine drainage amd sites previous studies have shown that sulfite and other sulfoxy compounds are detectable at the micromolar to millimolar levels in amd sediments or solutions druschel et al 2004 ma and banfield 2011 moreover the coexistence of sulfite ferrihydrite heavy metals and uv in amd relevant environments is possible because i the metastable phases of ferrihydrite are also frequently found in the system of pyrite oxidation balistrieri et al 1999 sánchez españa et al 2005 ii ferrihydrite generally entraps a variety of heavy metals i e cd as cr pb cu etc hiemstra 2013 shi et al 2021 and iii solar irradiation can penetrate water in a depth of several meters and sediments with a thickness of several millimeters ciani et al 2005 liu et al 2021b these considerations stimulate in depth research to understand the behavior of uv sulfite induced ferrihydrite dissolution and transformation and its importance to fe geochemistry and the relevant mobility immobility of heavy metals therefore the objectives of the current study were to i demonstrate the phenomenon that the combination of uv light and aqueous sulfite is conducive to ferrihydrite transformation to more crystalline minerals which in turn affects the mobility of cd ii elucidate the mechanism governing the reduction dissolution and phase transformation in the uv sulfite system that is supposed to generate both reductive species e g eaq and oxidative species e g so3 and oh and iii identify the evolution of secondary minerals and their interactions with cd at the molecular level to achieve these goals a series of experiments were conducted with and without uv irradiation and in the absence and presence of sulfite at different concentrations electron paramagnetic resonance epr and scavenging tests were performed to examine the generation of reactive species and to reveal their roles in ferrihydrite transformation the extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs spectroscopy mössbauer spectroscopy and other physicochemical techniques were used to obtain information regarding the fe local structure in ferrihydrite and the

schwertmann and cornell 2008 briefly 1 m naoh was added dropwise to the solution containing 0 1 m fecl3 6h2o until its ph was titrated to 7 0 7 5 the resulting particles were centrifuged 8000 rpm 5 min and washed 6 times with di water and then re dispersed in di water by ultrasonic shaking the stock suspension was purged with high purity n2 for more than 2 h and then immediately transferred to an anaerobic glove box the mass concentration of ferrihydrite was calculated from the measured total fe concentration using the commonly used molecular formula fe5ho8 4h2o lepidocrocite was

this process the color of the suspension changed from dark greenish blue to grey and finally to orange to obtain lepidocrocite the particles were collected and washed with di water at least 3 times goethite was prepared from an alkaline system schwertmann and cornell 2008 of which 100 ml of 1 m fe no3 3 was poured into a 2 l polyethylene flask and 180 ml of 5 m koh was rapidly added with

2014 shu et al 2019 otherwise the freeze dried samples were promptly detected we should state that the phase transformation of the resultant minerals during storage did not occur because they were in the form of fe iii oxyhydr oxides the surface morphology of the solid samples was characterized using scanning electron microscopy sem merlin zeiss co germany the mineral phases of the selected solid samples were analyzed using an x ray diffractometer x pert pro mrd panalytical holland germany and cu kα radiation λ 1 5418 å 40 kv and 40 ma diffractograms were recorded in the 2θ range of 10 70 with

for collecting the xafs data and the corresponding analysis are depicted in text s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations of the structural evolution of the uv sulfite induced transformation of cd bearing ferrihydrite the xrd analysis was conducted to discern the variation in the crystallized structure of cd bearing ferrihydrite upon uv irradiation and the addition of aqueous sulfite which influences the rate and extent of ferrihydrite transformation and the resulting products fig 1 a shows that the diffraction peaks of 2 line ferrihydrite typically at 2θ of 33 and 61 displayed no detectable changes under the conditions of either uv alone or 10 mm so3 2 alone in stark contrast the combination of uv and sulfite after 8 h of aging induced the appearance of strongly crystalline peaks attributed to goethite pdf 00 29 0713 sheng et al 2020a signifying the interactive effect in promoting ferrihydrite transformation the occurrence of ferrihydrite transformation is closely linked to the concentration of sulfite and is dependent on the reaction time at a low concentration 2 mm so3 2 the transformation exhibited slower overall kinetics and resulted in the formation of lepidocrocite pdf 00 08 0098 sheng et al 2020a for instance the distinct emergence of the lepidocrocite peaks was observed until 8 h of reaction time fig 1b when the concentration of so3 2 increased to 5 mm obvious changes in the peak profile appeared at 6 h and the final product at 8 h was composed of goethite major and lepidocrocite minor fig 1c fig 1d reveals that increasing the sulfite concentration to 10 mm significantly enhanced the transformation kinetics as 3 h of reaction time led to a remarkable appearance of new diffraction peaks which were attributed to goethite these findings are in good agreement with the literature results regarding the fe ii catalyzed ferrihydrite transformation into secondary and more crystalline minerals boland et al 2014 liu et al 2007 pedersen et al 2005 the production rate of adsorbed fe ii and the subsequent oxidation rate of this species are believed to be the key factors determining the type of secondary minerals and the extent of their formation this point is discussed in later sections the difference in the functional groups of fe oxyhydr oxides before and after treatment by uv sulfite was explored using the ftir which also supported the dynamic evolution of the mineral phase in general the strong bands centered at 795 and 890 cm 1 together with a broad band at 640 cm 1 were attributed to the ftir spectra of goethite gotić and musić 2007 kahani and jafari 2009 lepidocrocite exhibits three bands at 554 740 and 1021 cm 1 corresponding to the fe o γoh out of plane and δoh in plane vibrations respectively lewis and farmer 1986 xiao et al 2017 fig 2 a clearly indicates that there was little change in the infrared spectra under the uv alone and dark sulfite conditions and that the characteristic features derived from goethite were visible in the sample after 8 h of treatment note that the absorption peaks at 1040 cm 1 were due to the existence of s o stretching of sulfur containing group in the buffer solution zhou et al 2022 as illustrated in fig 2b the addition of 2 mm so3 2 to the uv system provoked the appearance of typical bands assigned to lepidocrocite from 3 to 8 h of operation and their intensities increased over time the presence of 5 mm so3 2 led to a gradual emergence of characteristic bands corresponding to goethite which accompanied the formation of the lepidocrocite bands fig 2c fig 2d shows that the predominant bands were attributed to goethite in the uv system containing 10 mm so3 2 the vibration peaks were strengthened with prolonged time suggesting that the elevated amount of goethite formed over time it should be emphasized that the uptake of cd 10 mg g 1 at an initial cd concentration of 5 mg l 1 in the ferrihydrite did not visibly impact its transformation as is evident based on the observations that the time dependent xrd and ftir results of the ferrihydrite samples in the absence of cd were highly similar to those in the presence of cd fig s1 the sem analysis was performed to examine the differences in the mineral surface morphology during the phase transformation fig s2 shows the sem images of the as synthesized cd bearing ferrihydrite and the end products of the transformation under uv irradiation with the sulfite concentrations of 0 2 5 and 10 mm when sulfite was unavailable the solid surface appeared to be flocculent which resembled that of the initial ferrihydrite again supporting the role of sulfite in promoting phase transformation the sem image of the sample formed at 2 mm so3 2 exhibited a typical lamellar structure of lepidocrocite qafoku et al 2020 schwertmann and cornell 2008 both lamellar and needle like crystals were observed on the mineral surface after the reaction in the uv sulfite system with 5 mm so3 2 the addition of 10 mm made the needle like crystals prevalent on the surface conforming to the generation of goethite as the ultimate product of the fe ii catalyzed ferrihydrite transformation boland et al 2014 hansel et al 2005 a further understanding of the mineral transformation of cd bearing ferrihydrite at the molecular level was aided by the mössbauer spectroscopy and the fe k edge exafs spectroscopy characterizations remarkable variations in the mössbauer spectra figs 3a d were revealed between the samples after uv irradiation over 8 h and in the absence and presence of sulfite at different concentrations which is in good agreement with the xrd and ftir results the fitting results and relevant parameters are provided in table s1 the mössbauer spectrum of the mineral without the engagement of sulfite exhibited a six fold peak with the typical parameters of ferrihydrite is 0 46 mm s 1 qs 0 05 mm s 1 bishop et al 1993 the addition of 2 mm so3 2 led to a partial transformation of ferrihydrite into lepidocrocite is 0 42 mm s 1 qs 0 037 mm s 1 and the addition of 5 mm so3 2 yielded the appearance of secondary minerals including lepidocrocite is 0 52 mm s 1 qs 0 01 mm s 1 and goethite is 0 48 mm s 1 qs 0 13 mm s 1 increasing the concentration of so3 2 to 10 mm resulted in a complete ferrihydrite transformation to goethite is 0 44 mm s 1 qs 0 22 mm s 1 bishop et al 1993 meng et al 2022 thomasarrigo et al 2018 the relative abundances of the mineral species after illumination for 8 h in the aqueous sulfite solution were estimated from the fitting results 41 9 lepidocrocite and 58 1 ferrihydrite at 2 mm so3 2 41 8 goethite 28 2 lepidocrocite and 29 1 ferrihydrite at 5 mm so3 2 and 100 goethite at 10 mm so3 2 beyond the solid phase fe iii signals the peaks associated with adsorbed fe ii were also observed in the original spectra of samples with 5 and 10 mm so3 2 the relative content of adsorbed fe ii increased with the increasing sulfite concentration from 0 95 5 mm so3 2 to 4 46 10 mm so3 2 liu et al 2021a this indicates that the enhanced concentration of fe ii bound to the mineral is favorable to ferrihydrite conversion into goethite boland et al 2014 huang et al 2021 jones et al 2017 the fe k edge exafs spectra also provide solid evidence of successful ferrihydrite transformation in the uv sulfite systems and a dependence of the conversion proportion on the sulfite concentration as illustrated in fig 3e a negligible transformation of ferrihydrite occurred under the sulfite free condition with uv radiation after 8 h of reaction time likewise no conversion appeared with the addition of 10 mm so3 2 in the dark on the contrary the fe k edge exafs signals clearly changed in the uv sulfite solution based on the fitting results by referring to the standard curves of ferrihydrite lepidocrocite and goethite the phase fractions of these minerals in different solid samples after 8 h of radiation were quantified fig 3f specifically the proportions of ferrihydrite were 63 5 29 0 and 0 those of lepidocrocite were 36 5 21 7 and 0 and those of goethite were 0 49 3 and 100 corresponding to the as resulted solids under uv irradiation with 2 5 and 10 mm so3 2 respectively despite the slight differences in the exact values between the fitted results of exafs and the mössbauer analysis they displayed an identical trend with lepidocrocite as the intermediate product at a low sulfite concentration and goethite as the final product at a high sulfite concentration this behavior is similar to that reported for the transformation of fe iii oxides assisted by biogenic fe ii xiao et al 2018 3 2 mechanistic investigations on uv sulfite induced ferrihydrite transformation it has been documented that the rate of fe ii uptake and the solid bound fe ii concentration are important in determining which particular minerals form and at what rate with respect to fe ii accelerated ferrihydrite transformation to more crystalline products boland et al 2014 liu et al 2021a sheng et al 2020b likewise the time courses of adsorbed fe ii concentrations in all setups were recorded and their dependence on the initial sulfite concentration was evaluated fig 4 a shows that the rate and extent of solid associated fe ii formation were closely linked with the content of sulfite no solid associated fe ii was detectable in the absence of sulfite suggesting that no other reductants responsible for fe iii reduction were available in such systems a more rapid increase in the concentration of adsorbed fe ii was observed at 10 mm so3 2 and it mounted to the summit 9 02 mg l 1 within 20 min the relevant values associated with 5 and 2 mm so3 2 distinctly decreased to 6 25 and 3 33 mg l 1 respectively the order of the adsorbed fe ii concentration determined by the wet chemistry analysis was highly consistent with the results revealed by the mössbauer analysis the latter suggested relatively higher adsorbed fe ii values particularly at 10 mm so3 2 possibly due to the involvement of adsorbed fe ii and structural fe ii in the mineral it is expected that the reduction and dissolution of ferrihydrite were driven by hydrated electrons eaq photoexcited super reductants e 2 3 v vs nhe arising from the uv sulfite process li et al 2012 wacławek et al 2022 to confirm the effectiveness of eaq in promoting fe iii reduction the epr analysis and scavenging experiments were conducted distinct tempo eaq signals were observable fig 4b in uv sulfite whose intensities were significantly attenuated upon the addition of ferrihydrite after 1 min of irradiation increasing the operation time to 3 min completely extinguished the epr signals both no3 and no2 were selected as the quencher for eaq due to the extremely high rate constants of 9 7 109 and 4 1 109 m 1 s 1 respectively buxton et al 1988 wang et al 2022 fig 4c shows that the rate of ferrihydrite transformation was 0 115 h 1 in the uv system with 10 mm so3 2 and that the presence of no3 and no2 greatly inhibited the conversion of ferrihydrite these results corroborate the role of eaq in facilitating fe iii reduction it can also be observed in fig 4a that the adsorbed fe ii concentration first climbed and then dropped with the increasing time in the uv sulfite systems this profile indicates that fe ii oxidation accompanied the uv sulfite induced reduction of ferrihydrite which is in accordance with the observation of microbial ferrihydrite reduction dong et al 2020 previous studies have demonstrated that fe ii fe iii electron transfer at the iron oxide water interface occurs which accounts for the ultimate mineral transformation when additional fe ii was reacted with ferrihydrite boland et al 2014 handler et al 2009 for this fe ii catalyzed process the concentration of adsorbed fe ii is usually maintained at a relatively constant value sheng et al 2020b however in our case the content of solid associated fe ii substantially decreased with the increase in the duration e g from 9 0 mg l 1 at 20 min to 1 3 mg l 1 at 8 h it thus can be hypothesized that an alternative pathway should influence the oxidation of fe ii and the resulting fe iii oxyhydr oxide products to verify this a series of reference experiments were performed with the addition of external fe ii at different concentrations to the aqueous ferrihydrite systems fig s3 illustrates that the levels of adsorbed fe ii were comparable to those in the uv sulfite processes but they did not significantly vary during 8 h of operation despite the observations of ferrihydrite transformation lepidocrocite appeared to be the major crystalline mineral for all the investigated cases with an adsorbed fe ii concentration that varied from 3 0 to 10 5 mg l 1 as shown by the xrd results fig s4 this is different from the result that goethite was the predominant product in the uv sulfite systems at high sulfite concentrations moreover the presence of sulfite 10 mm so3 2 without the involvement of uv can result in the reduction of ferrihydrite evidenced by the release of fe ii and its adsorption on the solid surface as shown in fig s5 but it was ineffective in causing its conversion fig 1a this implies the importance of other possible oxidants having the capacity to convert fe ii into fe iii fig 5 a depicts the dmpo relevant epr signals detected in different systems which are suggestive of the presence of so3 another product resulting from the photolysis of sulfite li et al 2012 yang et al 2020a the uv sulfite system exhibited the strongest dmpo so3 intensities and the co existence of ferrihydrite alleviated the magnitude indicating the consumption of so3 likely by fe ii the addition of more amounts of fe ii further weakened the signals this proves the involvement of so3 in fe ii oxidation in addition fig s6 shows that no relevant signals were visible under the dark condition and that the intensities of the dmpo so3 patterns were positively correlated with the initial sulfite concentration the possibility of a reaction between so3 and fe ii was also evident based on the differentiation in the decay rate of sulfite between the aqueous systems in the presence and absence of ferrihydrite as illustrated in fig 5b the addition of ferrihydrite remarkably retarded the decline in the sulfite concentration and this inhibition effect was distinct for all the investigated systems these results are considered to be the regeneration of sulfite resulting from so3 induced fe ii oxidation it should be noted that no dmpo ho patterns were revealed in the uv sulfite system corroborating that insignificant amounts of ho were produced upon light irradiation fig 5c also shows that the addition of nb meoh and tba excellent scavengers preferentially reacting with ho huang et al 2017 liang et al 2020 did not alter the rate of ferrihydrite transformation which is indicative of a negligible role of ho in fe ii oxidation high valence fe species with a high oxidative capacity may be produced from the fe ii catalyzed fe iii mineral transformation system under anoxic conditions hua et al 2022 however the addition of dmso that can quench fe iv species liang et al 2020 apparently did not slow the conversion rate fig 5c suggesting that fe iv also has an inappreciable impact on fe ii oxidation to summarize the uv sulfite process initiated ferrihydrite transformation primarily involves two reaction steps i reduction and dissolution of fe iii at the ferrihydrite surface and ii uptake of fe ii by the solid and its subsequent oxidation to fe iii for the first step the photolysis of sulfite yields the formation of eaq and so3 eq 2 li et al 2012 the former species is a powerful reductant that triggers the reduction of surface bound fe iii to fe ii eq 3 a similar fe iii reduction can also be driven by sulfite itself eq 4 despite its relatively lower reducing capacity for the second step it is generally accepted that the electron transfer atomic exchange mechanism eqs 5 6 governs fe ii oxidation and recrystallization boland et al 2014 sheng et al 2020b however in our cases the contribution of so3 induced conversion of fe ii eq 7 should play a crucial role in the oxidation of surface bound fe ii to newly formed fe iii oxyhydroxides this reaction is thermodynamically favorable considering the higher value of e so3 so3 2 0 63 v vs she than that of e fe iii fe ii 0 18 vs she liu et al 2020 it should be stated that sulfite binding to the surface of ferrihydrite is a prerequisite step for eaq triggered fe iii reduction and so3 induced fe ii oxidation process because all the reactions are considered to take place at the surface the adsorption of sulfite by ferrihydrite was evident from the prominent ftir peaks e g at 1040 cm 1 in fig s7 that were assigned to s o stretching of sulfur containing group faguy et al 1996 moreover an increase in the sulfite concentration led to the increasing intensity of the characteristic peaks previous studies have also reported that sulfite can bind to fe iii via inner sphere complexation zhou et al 2018 the rate and extent of surface bound fe ii formed upon uv irradiation increased with the increase in the initial sulfite concentration ultimately determining the type of secondary minerals and at what rate they formed lepidocrocite production dominated at relatively low surface associated fe ii concentrations whereas goethite production was predominant at high surface associated fe ii concentrations the acceleration of ferrihydrite transformation and goethite formation was achieved by the elevated sulfite concentration 2 so3 2 hv so3 eaq 3 fe iii eaq fe ii 4 2fe iii so3 2 h2o 2fe ii so4 2 2h 5 fe iii ofe ii fe ii ofe iii 6 fe ii

environments due to its relatively high surface area and abundant surface hydroxyl groups and the transformation of ferrihydrite to more crystalline minerals significantly influences the speciation and mobility of cd maillot et al 2011 michel et al 2007 zhao et al 2022a zhou et al 2020 fig 6 a shows that the addition of 0 5 g l 1 ferrihydrite resulted in the removal of 58 3 of cd initial concentration of 5 mg l 1 after 24 h and the concentration of aqueous cd stabilized at 2 1 0 1 mg l 1 the long time uv irradiation slightly improved the adsorption of cd on ferrihydrite likely due to a slight increase in temperature note that the presence of sulfite at concentrations from 2 to 10 mm so3 2 substantially abated the concentration of cd in the aquatic phase by 90 fig 6b d the promoted cd adsorption was attributed to the formation of cd so3 ternary surface complexes on the fe iii oxyhydroxides which is in line with previous observations and evidenced by the increasing intensity of the ftir peak at 1115 cm 1 with the increase in the sulfite concentration fig s7 zhang and peak 2007 however cd adsorbed by ferrihydrite was released again as a consequence of mineral transformation under uv induced reducing conditions fig 6 depicts that the time dependent evolution of cd was clearly affected by the sulfite concentration and was closely linked to the relative proportions of secondary mineral phases at 2 mm so3 2 the apparent cd release with the increasing time was observed with the dissolved cd content increasing from 9 0 to 30 8 over 8 h the liberation of cd was greatly inhibited at higher sulfite concentrations at 10 mm so3 2 the 8 h of reaction time only led to an increase in the concentration of dissolved cd from 9 8 to 14 1 the difference in the amount of cd released can be explained by the different extents of ferrihydrite recrystallization and newly formed minerals the observation of a higher cd release at a lower sulfite concentration was considered to be correlated with the partial transformation of ferrihydrite to lepidocrocite which poorly adsorbs cd due to the low surface area zhou et al 2020 a lower cd release at increasing sulfite concentrations was attributed to the production of goethite which exhibits a stronger capacity for cd uptake shen et al 2022 previous studies have shown that the presence of so4 2 dramatically promoted cd adsorption on goethite via the formation of cd so4 ternary surface complexes zhang and peak 2007 this phenomenon has also been observed on ferrihydrite but it was not as significant as goethite swedlund et al 2009 to explore cd repartitioning in the solid fe iii minerals formed in the uv sulfite systems as a function of the sulfite concentration the contents of adsorbed cd and structural cd were measured by extraction using 0 4 m and 4 m hcl respectively liu et al 2016 reddy et al 2015 as illustrated in fig 6b d the concentration of structural cd exhibited a positive correlation with the extent of ferrihydrite transformed to lepidocrocite and goethite suggesting a strong association between cd and the newly formed crystalline minerals when the concentrations of so3 2 increased from 2 to 10 mm the proportion of structural cd dramatically increased from 8 2 to 35 1 the higher fraction of structural cd coexisted with crystalline minerals which indicates a lower potential risk of heavy metal dissolution to understand the enhanced immobilization of cd by the newly formed crystalline minerals at the molecular scale the bonding environment of cd was determined based on an analysis of the exafs spectra and their fourier transforms fig 7 a b respectively the 8 h treated samples in the uv sulfite systems at different sulfite concentrations were subjected to analysis as shown by the cd k2 weighted exafs spectra the third oscillation in the k space appeared at 7 2 å 1 for the cd bearing ferrihydrite sample zhao et al 2022a however this value associated with the transformation samples shifted to a positive peak location with a more pronounced effect observed in the case of 10 mm so3 2 at 7 6 å 1 this indicates the inclusion of cd into the structure of goethite during the uv sulfite initiated ferrihydrite transformation spadini et al 1994 zhao et al 2022a the shell by shell approach to exafs fitting see the detailed parameters in table s2 provided further evidence of the immobilization of cd upon treatment with uv sulfite particularly at high sulfite concentrations the first pronounced peak in the fourier transform of cd bearing ferrihydrite occurred at r δr 1 6 å uncorrected for phase shift which is attributable to the cd o shell comprising approximately six o atoms on average of 2 27 0 01 å from the cd atom which is consistent with previously reported values spadini et al 1994 yan et al 2021 however the exafs of the transformed products showed that the cd o distance declined to the value of 2 24 0 01 2 26 0 01 å implying the existence of cd doping in the secondary mineral structure spadini et al 1994 there were two other prominent backscattering peaks in the fourier transformed data which were well fitted with two cd fe shells for the untransformed sample the first and second cd fe shells had an interatomic distance of 3 23 0 04 and 3 40 0 04 å respectively suggesting that cd mainly existed as edge sharing complexes randall et al 1999 yan et al 2021 after a reaction time of 8 h under uv irradiation in the presence of 2 5 and 10 mm so3 2 the interatomic distance of the first and second cd fe shells was in the range of 3 10 0 01 3 15 0 03 å and 3 37 0 02 3 40 0 02 å respectively the apparent decrease particularly in the first cd fe shell suggests that cd was structurally doped into the secondary minerals zhao et al 2022a zhou et al 2020 moreover the increasing aqueous sulfite concentration led to an increase in the intensity of the cd fe peaks in the fourier transformed data again this is likely to be due to the incorporation of cd in the newly formed mineral burton et al 2020 mitsunobu et al 2013 likewise the coordination number cn of the cd fe shells significantly expanded as a result of uv sulfite treatment and increased with higher sulfite concentrations for example the cn of the first cd fe shell was 0 5 1 1 2 1 and 2 9 in relation to 0 2 5 and 10 mm so3 2 respectively this indicates that the transformation of ferrihydrite to lepidocrocite and goethite causes a tighter bonding between cd and minerals burton et al 2020 overall these data in combination with the abovementioned chemical analysis collectively and convincingly show that cd was incorporated into the lepidocrocite goethite structure possibly by replacing fe iii 4 conclusions our findings demonstrate that the activation of aqueous sulfite by uv irradiation significantly triggered the transformation of cd bearing ferrihydrite to more crystalline mineral products the concentration of sulfite added to the uv system was a key factor in determining the rate of the ferrihydrite transformation and the particular type of minerals formed lepidocrocite was found to be the dominant compound at a low sulfite concentration and goethite primarily existed at a high sulfite concentration the mechanistic studies revealed that eaq an extremely strong reducing species stemming from the uv sulfite system played an important role in driving the reduction and dissolution of ferrihydrite to fe ii which was subsequently adsorbed onto mineral surfaces the amount of surface bound fe ii markedly affected the transformation rate and its oxidation by so3 was considered to be the foremost pathway governing fe ii conversion to newly formed fe iii oxyhydroxides the combination of the chemical analysis and the cd k edge exafs analysis corroborated that an increasing proportion of cd was more stably bound to the secondary products particularly goethite by structural incorporation when the photoinduced transformation occurred at high sulfite concentrations the results strengthen our understanding of the role of photochemistry in predicting the geochemical cycle of fe in natural environments e g amd sites containing sulfite and thereby the fate of heavy metals that are associated with fe minerals moreover because sulfite has the benefits of abundant sources low toxicity and low cost the uv sulfite based advanced reduction process would be a promising and viable approach to immobilize heavy metals beyond its general recognition for eliminating a variety of persistent and

15088,phosphorus p is often regarded as the primary stimulant for eutrophication while its importance as a crucial life element is also well acknowledged given its future scarcity p recycling from waste streams is suggested and practiced electrochemically mediated precipitation emp is a robust and chemical free process for p removal and recovery yet it requires further developments the first generation of the caco3 packed electrochemical precipitation column successfully solved the problem of h oh recombination achieving enhanced p removal efficiency with less energy consumption but suffering from low ca phosphate purity in recovered products herein a new concept of a basket anode electrochemical system is proposed and validated to prevent direct h oh recombination and enhance product purity the caco3 pellets packed basket anode alleviates the oh depletion by caco3 h interaction and provides extra ca2 for enhanced p removal the novel structure of the basket anode by its derived acidic anode region and alkaline cathode region completely avoids the precipitation of ca phosphate on the packed caco3 and greatly facilitates the collection of high quality ca phosphate product our results suggest that almost 100 of the removed p was in high purity highly crystalline ca phosphate on the cathode the recovered products contained significantly more p 13 5 wt than in the previous study 0 1 wt at similar energy consumptions 29 8 kwh kg p the applied current density pellets size and influent p concentration were critical for p removal performance product purity and power consumption we further demonstrated the long term stability of this novel system and its technical and economic feasibility in treating real stored urine our study provides new cell architectural designs to enhance the performance of emp systems and may inspire innovations and developments in other electrochemical water treatment processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords basket anode phosphate recovery high purity products local ph long term application data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction phosphorus p is essential for all life forms and plays a vital role in industrial and environmental development our over exploitation of phosphate rock and improper use of p resources will result in future p resource scarcity and recurrent eutrophication cordell et al 2009 elser and bennett 2011 p removal and recovery from natural and engineered systems are often suggested and practiced in tackling this challenging situation nowadays the most popular and practiced methods for p removal are adsorption biological phosphorus removal chemical precipitation coagulation and fluidized bed crystallization desmidt et al 2015 kumar et al 2019 le et al 2020 nonetheless few existing solutions can provide ready to use recovered products without complex post treatment electrochemical techniques have recently attracted wide attention in water treatment and resource recovery sectors alkhadra et al 2022 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 in the realm of p recovery beyond the conventional electrocoagulation or alike processes hug and udert 2013 liang et al 2019 tian et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 new concepts like electrochemically mediated precipitation emp and flow capacitive deionization xu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 have gained increasing interest in addressing the issues of p being too much considered as a pollutant while it is fragile as a resource among these concepts emp stands out as a prospective process for p removal and recovery given its relatively simple architecture chemical free nature wide ph treatment range and feasibility towards non ortho phosphorus compounds especially for decentralized small to medium scale water treatment perera and englehardt 2020 wang et al 2021 while emp systems are still in the early stages they have already shown promising performance in treating many types of wastewater in lab studies such as sewage lei et al 2018 urine hao et al 2022 hug and udert 2013 dairy wastewater lei et al 2022 lei et al 2021a and anaerobic effluent takabe et al 2020 previous efforts on the emp and alike processes have been devoted to understanding the mechanism optimizing and improving the emp system s performance in this context a few innovative cell architectures lei et al 2019b liu et al 2021 were proposed with enhanced p removal efficiency and reduced energy consumption beyond orthophosphate the work of lei et al broadened the application of emp in dealing with non ortho p compounds i e phosphonates by combining anodic oxidation and cathodic precipitation lei et al 2020b this is an added value of the emp approach as conventional methods are less efficient when treating non ortho p on top of that emp derived products such as ca phosphate and struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o kekedy nagy et al 2020 are dense phosphate containing solids which can be directly collected without complex post treatment and serve as promising materials for direct fertilization or other industrial purposes i e flame retardants kong and liu 2020 mayer et al 2016 nonetheless the inherent weakness of the membrane less emp system requires further effort the core of emp originates from the local high ph close to the cathode surface resulting from the water reduction reaction eq 1 lei et al 2017 it creates a highly saturated environment for the formation and precipitation of phosphate minerals i e ca phosphate while not at the expense of raising the whole bulk ph considering its working principle the efficient utilization of the cathode derived oh is crucial in guaranteeing the efficiency of emp however the system s efficiency is affected negatively by the opposite anode reaction that produces protons eq 2 which wastes cathodic oh through h oh recombination eq 3 lei et al 2019a while the oh utilization can be rationally optimized such as lower influent ph lower current density and choosing a large surface cathode these adjustments are case dependent lei et al 2020a 2018 ion exchange membranes were typically needed to separate the electrochemical cell into a cathode high ph and an anode low ph compartment cusick et al 2014 kappel et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 in this way the direct recombination of h and oh can be prevented moreover the precipitation of phosphate minerals can be extended from the cathode surface to the whole cathode compartment cusick et al 2014 in turn the utilization efficiency of cathode produced hydroxyl ions is significantly improved however using membranes may result in severe membrane fouling and scaling especially targeting complex waste streams de paepe et al 2020 1 4 h 2 o 4 e 4 o h 2 h 2 2 2 h 2 o 4 h 4 e o 2 3 h o h h 2 o one alternative to membranes is to pack the cell with carbonate minerals i e caco3 the presence of caco3 particles reduces the direct recombination between cathode produced hydroxyl ions and anode produced protons as the packed carbonate minerals consume the anode produced protons leaving the cathode produced hydroxyl ions accumulated in the electrochemical cell lei et al 2019b meanwhile calcium ions ca2 are released into the cell participating in ca phosphate formation and precipitation likewise other common minerals such as siderite feco3 and magnesite mgco3 have been sequentially affirmed to have similar functions chen et al 2021 hao et al 2022 li et al 2021 while caco3 or similar minerals packed electrochemical precipitation columns achieve enhanced p removal efficiency and reduced energy consumption this novel column system suffers from low product purity for instance lei et al reported that the collected solids had an average p content of only 0 11 wt lei et al 2019b this is because ca phosphate was mixed with the packed material in the electrochemical precipitation column and it is challenging to recover the product from the mineral surface furthermore other issues such as clogging by ca precipitates in the packed columns were not addressed in previous studies chae et al 2021 which inevitably affect this technology s long term stability and further applications herein we report a novel concept of the second generation of the caco3 packed electrochemical precipitation system a basket shaped anode electrochemical system the unique property of this concept over previous approaches is that caco3 particles can be selectively and precisely packed only in the basket anode instead of the whole electrochemical cell the eminent advantage of this design is that the dissolution of packed minerals does not interfere with ca phosphate formation and precipitation as the two processes occur simultaneously but in different locations in this way the recovered products are no longer a mixture of ca phosphate precipitates and packing materials but solely ca phosphate precipitates with high purity and p content in addition this novel design eliminates the clogging issues in precipitation columns as the packing solids are limited inside the basket anode where decomposition happens rather than precipitation accordingly this study aims to evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of this caco3 packed basket anode in preventing direct h oh recombination providing ca2 and more importantly separating caco3 dissolution and ca phosphate precipitation in different regions next the impacts of operational parameters such as current density the particle size of filling materials and influent phosphate concentration were systematically investigated to this end the long term stability of this novel system was demonstrated and its performance in treating real effluent was exhibited this research may facilitate the study and application of minerals packed electrochemical precipitation systems beyond p removal and recovery 2 methods and material 2 1 materials and chemicals the basket anode fig s1 was purchased from mingxuan metal materials xingtai china such basket anodes can be commonly found in metal plating finishing industries the stainless steel cathode fig s2 was provided by maize filtration hengshui china na2so4 and na2hpo4 were purchased from macklin biochemical co ltd shanghai china the caco3 pellets are a scrap of caco3 filler masterbatch cfm from the polyethylene pe production line kindly received from donghao plastic co ltd dongguan china cfm is one of the most used fillers to enhance the toughness of the polymer matrix in pe products in which analytical grade caco3 was made into pellets with polyethylene as binding materials 2 2 design and system validation the electrochemical system coupled with basket anode was built up and its schematic view and photograph are shown in fig 1 a and fig s3 respectively the basket anode 29 mm h 118 mm was made of titanium coated by ru ir with meshes at a maximal diameter of 2 mm 80 g of caco3 pellets 4 6 mm were packed into the basket anode the tubular stainless steel cathode 90 mm h 120 mm was concentrically placed outside the packed anode and both were placed vertically in a polymethyl methacrylate reactor with a working volume of 1 l the meshed stainless steel cathode has an effective area of 222 4 cm2 all the tests were performed under constant current provided by a direct current power supply mn 155d zhaoxin co ltd at 20 0 5 c we first used phosphorus free synthetic wastewater 10 mm na2so4 to investigate how this caco3 packed basket anode affects oh accumulation and provides extra ca2 we then validated the feasibility and efficiency of this basket anode electrochemical system on p removal and recovery with p containing synthetic wastewater 1 mm p po4 3 and 10 mm na2so4 all the experiments in this part were performed under batch mode and lasted for 8 h furthermore this novel system was operated continuously 1 8 a m2 and 8 h hrt for 70 days we also looked at ca phosphate s distribution or precipitation location in the electrochemical reactor over long term operation specifically we intend to clarify whether the removed p can be recovered solely from the cathode without packing materials interference liquid samples were collected daily from inlets and outlets to record ph ca and p concentrations over the 70 day treatment noteworthy the outlet samples were analyzed with soluble p with filtration and total p concentration without filtration we consider the difference in the p concentration to be an indication of homogeneous p precipitation in bulk solution after the long term test we collected the packed caco3 pellets and examined their structure and component we want to see in particular if there are any ca phosphate precipitates on the pellets the collected pellets and recovered products from the cathode surface were further subjected to scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem eds x ray powder diffraction xrd characterization and components analysis 2 3 parameters investigation we studied the influence of operating parameters including current density or current 0 9 a m2 or 20 ma 1 8 a m2 or 40 ma and 3 6 a m2 or 80 ma pellet size 4 6 mm and 2 4 mm and influent p concentration 2 1 0 2 and 0 03 mm on the system s performance and explored the corresponding mechanisms all tests in this section were also performed under 8 h batch mode we collected both liquid samples and solid products for further analysis 2 4 real phosphorus containing wastewater treatment in this section we used real stored source separated urine from a random men s toilet in the college of engineering sustech table s3 the urine was diluted tenfold and stored for over 72 h for complete hydrolysis udert et al 2003 the mg and ca concentrations were very low as the spontaneous precipitation of struvite and ca phosphate occurred during urea hydrolysis the performance of this system in treating real wastewater was investigated in 12 h batch mode 2 2 a m2 and 2 4 mm pellet size liquid samples were taken to evaluate the p removal and the changes in key components including ca2 mg2 ph and n nh4 solid samples were also collected for further analysis all batch experiments were performed in triplicate unless specified and relevant data are presented as the mean with standard deviation 2 5 liquid analysis the ph was analyzed by a ph meter sevenexcellence mettler toledo as soon as the liquid samples were taken the concentrations of p and ca in liquid samples were determined by icp oes icap7400 duo mfc thermo scientific after proper filtration and dilution a toc analyzer toc multi n c 3100 analytik jena ag was applied to check the concentration of inorganic carbon we used visual minteq ver 3 1 to simulate the precipitation potential of possible minerals in the emp system 2 6 solid products characterization the packed particles after 70 day use were checked regarding their difference in surface morphology by sem eds and xrd and elemental composition solid products generated at each experiment under batch mode and 70 day continuous mode were all collected and characterized by sem eds and xrd where required we quantified the main composition of these solid products by icp oes after acid digestion 2 7 calculations the p removal efficiency in was calculated with eq 4 4 p r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y 100 c 0 c t c 0 where c0 and ct mean the p concentrations before and after treatment respectively the saturation index si is defined as eq 5 5 s i log i a p k s p where iap refers to the ion activity of the associated lattice ions and ksp refers to the solubility product the energy consumption in kwh of this electrochemical system was calculated by eq 6 6 w k w h u i t where u and i is the recorded voltage v and current i on average over the electrolysis of specific time h 3 results and discussion 3 1 proof of concept 3 1 1 function of the caco3 filled basket anode before the feasibility investigation we characterized the caco3 pellets qualitatively and quantitatively sem eds results showed that the pellets were irregular in shape and similar in size on which only calcium carbon and oxygen element were detected fig s4 its principal mineral component was calcite fig s4b and its ca content reached 38 table s2 we then investigated the feasibility of this caco3 packed basket shaped anode in limiting h oh recombination preserving oh and providing ca2 under 1 8 a m2 the bulk ph increased from 6 5 to 10 5 after 8 h of treatment fig 1b theoretically anodic water oxidation and cathodic water reduction in a single electrochemical cell will generate equal amounts of protons h and hydroxyl ions oh as a result the bulk ph will not change significantly because of h oh recombination lei et al 2019a however considering the limitation of mass diffusion the ph close to the cathode surface is always higher while the ph near the anode surface is lower than the bulk ph in our design the caco3 packed basket shaped anode allows the on site consumption of anode produced h eq 7 this means less h is released to the bulk solution thus limiting h oh recombination and leaving the cathode formed oh accumulated in the bulk solution as a result a significant increase in bulk ph from 6 5 to 10 5 was recorded fig 1b meanwhile the reaction between h and the packed caco3 particles brings ca2 into the bulk solution as confirmed by the increased ca2 concentration to 40 mg l fig 1b 7 c a c o 3 2 h c a 2 h 2 o c o 2 we further studied the behavior of packed materials in the absence of an electric current 0 ma fig s5 shows that the solution ph increased from 6 7 to 9 4 followed by an increased ca2 concentration to 5 14 mg l after 8 h these results indicate that the packed caco3 particles are slightly soluble under neutral conditions nonetheless the solution ph and ca2 concentration were much lower than at 1 8 a m2 in summary the introduction of this novel basket anode allowed the caco3 h reaction to occur within the limited anodic area and increased the ph and ca2 concentration in the cathode region which is ideal for inducing ca phosphate formation and precipitation fig 1a 3 1 2 phosphorus recovery in this basket anode electrochemical system after understanding the function of the caco3 packed basket anode we evaluated the performance of this novel system for p recovery for this purpose we supplied the feed solution with 1 0 mm po4 3 the system achieved 55 removal of p po4 3 after 8 h treatment with 1 8 a m2 fig 1c by contrast in an open circuit 0 ma no apparent removal of po4 3 was observed fig s6 this precludes the possible po4 3 removal by packed materials whether by adsorption or other mechanisms karageorgiou et al 2007 martin et al 2018 as confirmed above the packed caco3 particles in the basket shaped anode consumed the anodic produced h providing ca2 and creating a high ph environment beyond the cathode surface when phosphate is present in the feed solution it may participate in ca phosphate formation and precipitation given the ideal environment created in the caco3 packed electrochemical system indeed as shown in fig 1c the final ca2 concentration in the bulk solution was reduced significantly from 40 to 8 mg l when the feed solution contained po4 3 which is explained by ca phosphate precipitation the accumulation of oh or the high local ph in the vicinity of the cathode surface has been revealed to play a critical role in many electrochemical processes lei et al 2017 zhang and co 2020 while the direct measure of the local ph is a challenge and is not the focus of the current study we assumed the local ph close to the cathode should be at least 10 5 given the bulk ph reached 10 5 with the ca2 released from the basket anode the hydroxyapatite hap saturation index si went beyond zero rapidly it remained at a high level of saturation si 10 fig s7 indicating the solution was supersaturated concerning ca phosphate meanwhile visible white precipitates were found on the cathode surface and were confirmed to be crystalline ca phosphate from sem images of this product collected from the cathode we noticed the aggregation of spherical particles which is probably linked to amorphous calcium phosphate acp lei et al 2017 fig s8a this is further supported by the relevant element distribution fig s8 and xrd analysis fig s9 therefore an enhanced phosphate recovery in this system as ca phosphate was demonstrated to be feasible nonetheless given the release of both ca2 and bi carbonate from caco3 dissolution one may argue that caco3 can still form as a by product and co precipitate with ca phosphate indeed in previous studies we found the formation of caco3 as a by product in the presence of bi carbonate in emp systems lei et al 2019a lei et al 2018 in this case the calculation of si suggests potential caco3 generation at the final stage of the 8 h electrolysis period with a low si of 0 687 fig s7 the slightly higher ca p atomic ratio of recovered products 2 0 than typical acp 1 5 wang and nancollas 2008 also points to the formation of carbonate replaced ca phosphate or the co precipitation of caco3 minerals wang and nancollas 2008 even so the product generated in this system still had a much lower ca p ratio than those mixed with packing materials 326 8 lei et al 2019b which will be further discussed in the next chapter 3 2 boosted product quality and stabilized performance over long term operation to further explore the precipitation location of ca phosphate we performed a 70 day continuous operation with the same setup we found that almost all the p was recovered as high purity highly crystalline ca phosphate on the cathode without blending with the caco3 pellets after 70 days of use the morphology of the pellets packed inside the anode did not experience any visible change fig 2 b and f in line with the dissolution of caco3 the ca wt decreased slightly from 38 to 33 table s2 eds results could not identify detectable p on the pellets surface figs 2g and s10 consistently the analysis of the elemental composition of packed materials by icp oes after acid digestion indicated the absence of ca phosphate on the filling pellets table s2 regarding the basket anode we did not observe any visible precipitates on its surface fig 2a and e this is because a low ph environment is created in the anodic region by the water oxidation reaction fig 1a although it is difficult to measure the ph of the anode zone directly the acidic environment can be corroborated by the accelerated caco3 decomposition with the electric current provided the acidic ph environment of the basket anode region eliminated any chance of ca phosphate precipitation in its filling area and on its surface thus preventing the mixing of the phosphate products and filling materials considering that different locations in the basket anode might have different h concentrations depending on how close it is to the anode wall where electrochemical reactions occur we also compared the caco3 pellets packed deep inside the basket anode and the one close to the anode wall consistently no ca phosphate precipitates were found on the pellets surface neither for the pellets packed deep inside the anode nor the pellets close to the anode surface fig s12 and table s2 this suggests that a stable sufficient low ph area was maintained in the basket anode based on the above discussion all the removed p was recovered outside the basket anode and its packing material either by heterogeneous precipitation on the cathode and or homogeneous precipitation in bulk theoretically homogeneous precipitation could happen in bulk solution in the cathode region given an outlet ph of around 9 0 fig 3 we compared the p removal efficiency in filtrated and non filtrated outlets over the 70 day electrolysis where there is a difference it can be considered homogeneous p precipitation in bulk solution encouragingly nearly all the po4 3 was removed by heterogeneous precipitation on the cathode as seen from the equal removal of po4 3 in filtrated and non filtrated samples fig 3 this can also be inferred from the cathode entirely covered by pure white solid products fig 2h while barely any precipitate was observed elsewhere in the cell the calculation of si indicates that the bulk solution was saturated with hap nonetheless given that the local ph close to the cathode was higher than the bulk ph the si near the cathode should be higher than in the bulk solution meaning the local area provides a higher driving force for ca phosphate formation and precipitation moreover precipitating on an existing heterogeneous growth center e g the ca phosphate deposited on the cathode is more kinetically favorable than nucleation in bulk solution therefore although thermodynamic calculation projects its saturation in the bulk solution no ca phosphate precipitates were found in the bulk solution the sem images of the solid product on the cathode showed a needle like shape that is recognized as the typical morphology of hap lu et al 2005 fig 2i the hap generation can be further confirmed by the xrd spectrum fig 2j the ca p atomic ratio of the recovered solids 1 8 is also close to the theoretical ratio of hap 1 7 instead of acp found in 8 h batch experiments highly crystalline hap dominated the solid product indicating the phase transfer of amorphous to crystalline ca phosphate over long term electrolysis which agrees with classic nucleation theory voorhees 1985 this boosting effect on product purity is even more remarkable when we compare its ca p ratio 1 8 with that of the recovered product 326 8 reported in the first generation of the caco3 packed electrochemical precipitation column lei et al 2019b undoubtfully this boosted purity can be attributed to the novel cell configuration thanks to the unique basket shaped anode the ca phosphate product is no longer formed on the filling material another reason could be the low ca p ratio in the treated wastewater in this system in the steady state stage of the long term treatment from the 27th day the ca p ratio was only 0 34 under such conditions ca phosphate precipitation was more thermodynamically favorable as ca phosphate species have much lower ksp than calcium carbonate wang and nancollas 2008 during this 70 day treatment the system was able to show a high p removal trend 80 in the first few days and this removal trend generally declined until it stabilized at around 40 from the 27th day fig 3 it also exhibited stable performance of the ph regulation in catholyte fig 3 distinguishing the low ph region anode and the high ph region cathode overall these results demonstrated that this system has good stability even under long term operation and it avoided mixing recovered ca phosphate with packing materials we noticed that the p removal efficiency was significantly correlated with ca2 concentration in the system throughout the 70 day treatment fig 3 the ca p molar ratio in the system during the steady state period was 0 34 at a ca p ratio as low as 0 34 the current density and the oh produced are no longer considered the primary rate limiting factor once ca2 was released ca2 were preferably used for ca phosphate precipitation since hap has a considerably low ksp 1 10 117 therefore the released amount of ca2 determines the p removal efficiency during the start up the release of ca2 was faster because the packing material always contained some easy to acidify parts of caco3 wang et al 2006 once those parts were dissolved the ca2 release became stable and so did the p removal therefore to further improve the p removal performance future studies could focus on intensifying the caco3 h reaction by proposing novel electrode configurations or applying acid vulnerable packing materials 3 3 influences of operating conditions on system s performance we studied the influence of current density on the performance of this electrochemical system using synthetic wastewater in batch mode and noteworthy the synthetic wastewater did not contain ca2 fig 4 a shows that the p removal efficiency is significantly correlated with the current density applied when the current density was increased from 0 9 to 1 8 a m2 the p removal after 8 h treatment soared from 5 9 to 54 5 previous studies have explained the mechanism behind this the applied current density has a significant impact on the oh concentration close to the cathode obata et al 2020 wang et al 2021 the saturation of ca phosphate species can be regulated by the current density applied in this system the water oxidation at the basket anode was also intensified by the enhanced current density bringing down the local ph inside the anode chamber the accelerated ca2 release and its enhanced electromigration to the cathode induced by the increased current density provided extra driving forces for ca phosphate precipitation indeed although substantially more phosphate was removed the remaining ca2 concentration in 1 8 a m2 9 5 mg l was higher than for 0 9 a m2 4 3 mg l after 8 h electrolysis fig 4c the influence of current density also highlights the importance of ca2 concentration relevant to phosphate in the case of 1 8 a m2 there was hardly p removal until 2 h because ca2 was still being released and accumulated fig 4c moreover although the p removal rate increased significantly from 2 h onwards at the end of the electrolysis the low ca concentration 9 5 mg l ca vs 13 9 mg l p in this system still limited p recovery luckily real wastewater always contains enough ca2 for example domestic wastewater influent has a typical ca2 concentration above 20 mg l van den brink et al 2009 meaning ca ions will no longer be a limiting factor in real cases we found that further increasing the current onefold to 3 6 a m2 only contributed to a 21 1 increase in p removal from 54 5 to 75 6 the power consumption was raised from 48 6 to 80 8 kwh kg p accordingly fig s14 suggesting that more energy was consumed by reactions other than ca phosphate precipitation in the caco3 packed electrochemical system ca2 po4 3 oh and bi carbonate ions are involved in this precipitation process and ca phosphate precipitation is a ph and concentration dependent process compared to a higher current density 3 6 a m2 at a current density of 1 8 a m2 oh is a limiting factor and ca phosphate precipitation dominates since the ksp of hap 1 10 117 wang and nancollas 2008 is much lower than that of caco3 3 36 10 9 zeng et al 2020 however when the current density was set at a higher level say 3 6 a m2 things may be completely different as oh may not be a limiting factor anymore on top of enhanced ca2 release and phosphate removal the increase of current density also brings more co3 2 to the bulk solution along with ca phosphate formation caco3 may take charge and become the main by product especially after the drop of p concentration by boosted p removal at enhanced current density the involvement of carbonate precipitation was evidenced by the ca p molar ratio of the derived products table s1 overall increasing the current density can promote ca release at the anode and intensify the high ph environment at the cathode by which an enhanced p removal can be achieved however an exceeded current density can still lead to substantial power consumption and by product formation that often occurs in emp systems wang et al 2021 3 3 1 influence of packing materials size to further limit the h oh recombination improve the oh utilization and enhance p recovery the caco3 h interaction needs to be intensified one efficient way to do that is by increasing the specific surface area of the pellets lei et al 2019b for which we ground the caco3 pellets to a smaller size of 2 4 mm in this way the ph and ca2 concentration increased remarkably fig 4e and f likewise the p removal was significantly improved from 54 5 to 89 7 fig 4d meanwhile the corresponding energy consumption was reduced by nearly half from 48 6 to 29 8 kwh kg p fig s15 regardless of the pellet size the electrochemical production of hydroxyl ions remained at the same level as long as the current intensity was not altered at a level of local ph under 1 8 a m2 ca phosphate has the potential to precipitate first lei et al 2018 with more ca2 and oh brought by the ground caco3 pellets the ca phosphate precipitation was selectively boosted with constant energy output reflected as a significantly reduced power consumption fig s15 and a recovered product less interfered with by products table s1 considering this enhancing the mass transfer of packing materials and anode derived h such as changing flow patterns or packing materials properties may be a promising way to optimize this system further 3 3 2 influence of inlet p concentration we further investigated the performance of this system in treating influents with different p concentrations this system showed promising recovery efficiency and stability in treating influents with various p concentrations fig 4g shows that when treating 2 0 mm p influent at 1 8 a m2 the p removal efficiency in 8 h was 25 5 and this value rose to 54 4 when 1 0 mm p influent was supplied the treatment of 0 2 mm p influent which is in the typical range for untreated domestic wastewater showed a remarkable removal of 91 4 in 8 h this is in line with what we observed in previous emp systems the lower the influent p concentration the higher the removal efficiency chen et al 2021 lei et al 2021b as expected no further improvement was observed in treating influents with shallow p concentration 0 03 mm this is related to the precipitation nature of ca phosphate species due to weakened buffering capacity the bulk ph was higher when 0 03 mm po4 3 was presented in the feed solution fig 4h however the si was lower than in the case of 0 2 mm due to the shortage of po4 3 availability fig s17 nonetheless this system reached more than 50 p removal while treating low p influents 0 03 mm notably this was not due to adsorption by the packed material fig s18 where required we can improve the system s performance further in treating low p containing wastewater by prolonging the induction time or increasing the current intensity in light of the working principle of caco3 packed basket anode ca oh 2 and other chemicals e g mgo based chemical precipitation process are possible alternatives as they increase the solution ph and provide cations for phosphate precipitation table s4 summarizes the chemical precipitation methods and electrochemical phosphorus recovery technologies compared to the present basket anode electrochemical system regarding the type of wastewater cost and product quality although parameter dependent the basket anode electrochemical system showed a comparable p removal efficiency 89 7 with existing techniques notably high purity recyclable solid was generated in the basket anode electrochemical system instead of the low purity sludge with poor settleability and filterability reported in chemical precipitation table s4 which significantly facilitates the collection and reuse of recovered products since no chemical dosage is required in this automatic system the operation cost of this electrochemical system is mainly electricity consumption calculated to be 2 5 kg p recovered which is competitive with chemical precipitation 2 8 8 9 kg p as well table s4 overall we can conclude that while the basket anode electrochemical system is still in its early stage it has already shown some advantages over chemical precipitation 3 4 performance toward real wastewater and economic analysis we further explored the effectiveness of this system in treating actual p rich wastewater stored urine fig 5 and table s3 show that 86 7 of p was recovered from stored urine in 12 h extra ca2 provided by the h caco3 reaction from the basket anode and the raised ph contributed to this very high p recovery efficiency although urea hydrolysis brought massive carbonate during storage udert et al 2003 and inevitably had a negative impact on the product purity all p was recovered as p rich products table s3 ready to be collected at the cathode the effluent ph after 12 h treatment was 7 9 which was within the accepted range of treated wastewater or influent for further biological treatment this system showed an energy consumption of 30 4 kwh kg p in treating real urine which is comparable with other advanced electrochemical techniques table s4 such as flow electrode capacitive deionization 27 8 kwh kg p xu et al 2020 and far lower than electrohydromodulation 63 5 202 4 kwh kg p perera et al 2020 mg electrocoagulation 1320 kwh kg p govindan et al 2021 and the emp process 4399 kwh kg p cid et al 2018 not to mention the greatly enhanced product quality an economic analysis based on the electricity consumption urine treating margin and revenue from phosphate products is provided in table s5 and text s1 it is estimated that an operational cost of 0 14 is required for treating 1 m3 stored urine revenues of urine treatment and phosphate product selling are estimated to be 0 22 and 0 08 respectively from treating 1 m3 urine consequently a gross profit of 0 16 m3 urine treated or 3 23 kg p recovered is obtained overall the preliminary finance calculation based on electrical operational costs suggested that this basket anode electrochemical system is technically and economically feasible for p recovery from real wastewater 4 conclusions electrochemical systems are promising for on site decentralized chemical free wastewater treatment and resource recovery including phosphate removal and recovery membranes are often used in electrochemical systems to increase the system s efficiency however the upscaling of membrane based electrochemical methods is often limited by membrane fouling and scaling we here reported a new cell architecture for a highly efficient membrane less electrochemical system for phosphate removal and recovery characterized by a unique basket shaped anode with caco3 packing we showed that the caco3 basket anode played a membrane like function dividing the electrochemical cell into a low ph anode region and a high ph cathode region the packed caco3 particles consumed the anode produced h alleviated the oh depletion and provided extra ca2 for ca phosphate precipitation the derived low ph anode region and the reinforced cathode environment eliminated ca phosphate mixing with filling materials nearly 100 of the removed p was collected from the cathode in high purity highly crystalline ca phosphate products notably the p removal performance was significantly correlated with the ca2 supply and ultimately bound with the caco3 h interaction thus higher p removal efficiency and lower energy consumption are expected by boosting the interaction between filling materials and the anode derived h for instance we may optimize electrode configuration or apply acid vulnerable packing materials the unique functions of the basket anode allow its application to be extended to other precipitation based recovery technologies for resource recovery or even other applications such as heavy metal removal we believe this research opens new possibilities to and beyond the development of emp techniques for phosphate recovery and provides an easily scalable system characterized by high efficiency low energy consumption

15088,phosphorus p is often regarded as the primary stimulant for eutrophication while its importance as a crucial life element is also well acknowledged given its future scarcity p recycling from waste streams is suggested and practiced electrochemically mediated precipitation emp is a robust and chemical free process for p removal and recovery yet it requires further developments the first generation of the caco3 packed electrochemical precipitation column successfully solved the problem of h oh recombination achieving enhanced p removal efficiency with less energy consumption but suffering from low ca phosphate purity in recovered products herein a new concept of a basket anode electrochemical system is proposed and validated to prevent direct h oh recombination and enhance product purity the caco3 pellets packed basket anode alleviates the oh depletion by caco3 h interaction and provides extra ca2 for enhanced p removal the novel structure of the basket anode by its derived acidic anode region and alkaline cathode region completely avoids the precipitation of ca phosphate on the packed caco3 and greatly facilitates the collection of high quality ca phosphate product our results suggest that almost 100 of the removed p was in high purity highly crystalline ca phosphate on the cathode the recovered products contained significantly more p 13 5 wt than in the previous study 0 1 wt at similar energy consumptions 29 8 kwh kg p the applied current density pellets size and influent p concentration were critical for p removal performance product purity and power consumption we further demonstrated the long term stability of this novel system and its technical and economic feasibility in treating real stored urine our study provides new cell architectural designs to enhance the performance of emp systems and may inspire innovations and developments in other electrochemical water treatment processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords basket anode phosphate recovery high purity products local ph long term application data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction phosphorus p is essential for all life forms and plays a vital role in industrial and environmental development our over exploitation of phosphate rock and improper use of p resources will result in future p resource scarcity and recurrent eutrophication cordell et al 2009 elser and bennett 2011 p removal and recovery from natural and engineered systems are often suggested and practiced in tackling this challenging situation nowadays the most popular and practiced methods for p removal are adsorption biological phosphorus removal chemical precipitation coagulation and fluidized bed crystallization desmidt et al 2015 kumar et al 2019 le et al 2020 nonetheless few existing solutions can provide ready to use recovered products without complex post treatment electrochemical techniques have recently attracted wide attention in water treatment and resource recovery sectors alkhadra et al 2022 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 in the realm of p recovery beyond the conventional electrocoagulation or alike processes hug and udert 2013 liang et al 2019 tian et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 new concepts like electrochemically mediated precipitation emp and flow capacitive deionization xu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 have gained increasing interest in addressing the issues of p being too much considered as a pollutant while it is fragile as a resource among these concepts emp stands out as a prospective process for p removal and recovery given its relatively simple architecture chemical free nature wide ph treatment range and feasibility towards non ortho phosphorus compounds especially for decentralized small to medium scale water treatment perera and englehardt 2020 wang et al 2021 while emp systems are still in the early stages they have already shown promising performance in treating many types of wastewater in lab studies such as sewage lei et al 2018 urine hao et al 2022 hug and udert 2013 dairy wastewater lei et al 2022 lei et al 2021a and anaerobic effluent takabe et al 2020 previous efforts on the emp and alike processes have been devoted to understanding the mechanism optimizing and improving the emp system s performance in this context a few innovative cell architectures lei et al 2019b liu et al 2021 were proposed with enhanced p removal efficiency and reduced energy consumption beyond orthophosphate the work of lei et al broadened the application of emp in dealing with non ortho p compounds i e phosphonates by combining anodic oxidation and cathodic precipitation lei et al 2020b this is an added value of the emp approach as conventional methods are less efficient when treating non ortho p on top of that emp derived products such as ca phosphate and struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o kekedy nagy et al 2020 are dense phosphate containing solids which can be directly collected without complex post treatment and serve as promising materials for direct fertilization or other industrial purposes i e flame retardants kong and liu 2020 mayer et al 2016 nonetheless the inherent weakness of the membrane less emp system requires further effort the core of emp originates from the local high ph close to the cathode surface resulting from the water reduction reaction eq 1 lei et al 2017 it creates a highly saturated environment for the formation and precipitation of phosphate minerals i e ca phosphate while not at the expense of raising the whole bulk ph considering its working principle the efficient utilization of the cathode derived oh is crucial in guaranteeing the efficiency of emp however the system s efficiency is affected negatively by the opposite anode reaction that produces protons eq 2 which wastes cathodic oh through h oh recombination eq 3 lei et al 2019a while the oh utilization can be rationally optimized such as lower influent ph lower current density and choosing a large surface cathode these adjustments are case dependent lei et al 2020a 2018 ion exchange membranes were typically needed to separate the electrochemical cell into a cathode high ph and an anode low ph compartment cusick et al 2014 kappel et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 in this way the direct recombination of h and oh can be prevented moreover the precipitation of phosphate minerals can be extended from the cathode surface to the whole cathode compartment cusick et al 2014 in turn the utilization efficiency of cathode produced hydroxyl ions is significantly improved however using membranes may result in severe membrane fouling and scaling especially targeting complex waste streams de paepe et al 2020 1 4 h 2 o 4 e 4 o h 2 h 2 2 2 h 2 o 4 h 4 e o 2 3 h o h h 2 o one alternative to membranes is to pack the cell with carbonate minerals i e caco3 the presence of caco3 particles reduces the direct recombination between cathode produced hydroxyl ions and anode produced protons as the packed carbonate minerals consume the anode produced protons leaving the cathode produced hydroxyl ions accumulated in the electrochemical cell lei et al 2019b meanwhile calcium ions ca2 are released into the cell participating in ca phosphate formation and precipitation likewise other common minerals such as siderite feco3 and magnesite mgco3 have been sequentially affirmed to have similar functions chen et al 2021 hao et al 2022 li et al 2021 while caco3 or similar minerals packed electrochemical precipitation columns achieve enhanced p removal efficiency and reduced energy consumption this novel column system suffers from low product purity for instance lei et al reported that the collected solids had an average p content of only 0 11 wt lei et al 2019b this is because ca phosphate was mixed with the packed material in the electrochemical precipitation column and it is challenging to recover the product from the mineral surface furthermore other issues such as clogging by ca precipitates in the packed columns were not addressed in previous studies chae et al 2021 which inevitably affect this technology s long term stability and further applications herein we report a novel concept of the second generation of the caco3 packed electrochemical precipitation system a basket shaped anode electrochemical system the unique property of this concept over previous approaches is that caco3 particles can be selectively and precisely packed only in the basket anode instead of the whole electrochemical cell the eminent advantage of this design is that the dissolution of packed minerals does not interfere with ca phosphate formation and precipitation as the two processes occur simultaneously but in different locations in this way the recovered products are no longer a mixture of ca phosphate precipitates and packing materials but solely ca phosphate precipitates with high purity and p content in addition this novel design eliminates the clogging issues in precipitation columns as the packing solids are limited inside the basket anode where decomposition happens rather than precipitation accordingly this study aims to evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of this caco3 packed basket anode in preventing direct h oh recombination providing ca2 and more importantly separating caco3 dissolution and ca phosphate precipitation in different regions next the impacts of operational parameters such as current density the particle size of filling materials and influent phosphate concentration were systematically investigated to this end the long term stability of this novel system was demonstrated and its performance in treating real effluent was exhibited this research may facilitate the study and application of minerals packed electrochemical precipitation systems beyond p removal and recovery 2 methods and material 2 1 materials and chemicals the basket anode fig s1 was purchased from mingxuan metal materials xingtai china such basket anodes can be commonly found in metal plating finishing industries the stainless steel cathode fig s2 was provided by maize filtration hengshui china na2so4 and na2hpo4 were purchased from macklin biochemical co ltd shanghai china the caco3 pellets are a scrap of caco3 filler masterbatch cfm from the polyethylene pe production line kindly received from donghao plastic co ltd dongguan china cfm is one of the most used fillers to enhance the toughness of the polymer matrix in pe products in which analytical grade caco3 was made into pellets with polyethylene as binding materials 2 2 design and system validation the electrochemical system coupled with basket anode was built up and its schematic view and photograph are shown in fig 1 a and fig s3 respectively the basket anode 29 mm h 118 mm was made of titanium coated by ru ir with meshes at a maximal diameter of 2 mm 80 g of caco3 pellets 4 6 mm were packed into the basket anode the tubular stainless steel cathode 90 mm h 120 mm was concentrically placed outside the packed anode and both were placed vertically in a polymethyl methacrylate reactor with a working volume of 1 l the meshed stainless steel cathode has an effective area of 222 4 cm2 all the tests were performed under constant current provided by a direct current power supply mn 155d zhaoxin co ltd at 20 0 5 c we first used phosphorus free synthetic wastewater 10 mm na2so4 to investigate how this caco3 packed basket anode affects oh accumulation and provides extra ca2 we then validated the feasibility and efficiency of this basket anode electrochemical system on p removal and recovery with p containing synthetic wastewater 1 mm p po4 3 and 10 mm na2so4 all the experiments in this part were performed under batch mode and lasted for 8 h furthermore this novel system was operated continuously 1 8 a m2 and 8 h hrt for 70 days we also looked at ca phosphate s distribution or precipitation location in the electrochemical reactor over long term operation specifically we intend to clarify whether the removed p can be recovered solely from the cathode without packing materials interference liquid samples were collected daily from inlets and outlets to record ph ca and p concentrations over the 70 day treatment noteworthy the outlet samples were analyzed with soluble p with filtration and total p concentration without filtration we consider the difference in the p concentration to be an indication of homogeneous p precipitation in bulk solution after the long term test we collected the packed caco3 pellets and examined their structure and component we want to see in particular if there are any ca phosphate precipitates on the pellets the collected pellets and recovered products from the cathode surface were further subjected to scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem eds x ray powder diffraction xrd characterization and components analysis 2 3 parameters investigation we studied the influence of operating parameters including current density or current 0 9 a m2 or 20 ma 1 8 a m2 or 40 ma and 3 6 a m2 or 80 ma pellet size 4 6 mm and 2 4 mm and influent p concentration 2 1 0 2 and 0 03 mm on the system s performance and explored the corresponding mechanisms all tests in this section were also performed under 8 h batch mode we collected both liquid samples and solid products for further analysis 2 4 real phosphorus containing wastewater treatment in this section we used real stored source separated urine from a random men s toilet in the college of engineering sustech table s3 the urine was diluted tenfold and stored for over 72 h for complete hydrolysis udert et al 2003 the mg and ca concentrations were very low as the spontaneous precipitation of struvite and ca phosphate occurred during urea hydrolysis the performance of this system in treating real wastewater was investigated in 12 h batch mode 2 2 a m2 and 2 4 mm pellet size liquid samples were taken to evaluate the p removal and the changes in key components including ca2 mg2 ph and n nh4 solid samples were also collected for further analysis all batch experiments were performed in triplicate unless specified and relevant data are presented as the mean with standard deviation 2 5 liquid analysis the ph was analyzed by a ph meter sevenexcellence mettler toledo as soon as the liquid samples were taken the concentrations of p and ca in liquid samples were determined by icp oes icap7400 duo mfc thermo scientific after proper filtration and dilution a toc analyzer toc multi n c 3100 analytik jena ag was applied to check the concentration of inorganic carbon we used visual minteq ver 3 1 to simulate the precipitation potential of possible minerals in the emp system 2 6 solid products characterization the packed particles after 70 day use were checked regarding their difference in surface morphology by sem eds and xrd and elemental composition solid products generated at each experiment under batch mode and 70 day continuous mode were all collected and characterized by sem eds and xrd where required we quantified the main composition of these solid products by icp oes after acid digestion 2 7 calculations the p removal efficiency in was calculated with eq 4 4 p r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y 100 c 0 c t c 0 where c0 and ct mean the p concentrations before and after treatment respectively the saturation index si is defined as eq 5 5 s i log i a p k s p where iap refers to the ion activity of the associated lattice ions and ksp refers to the solubility product the energy consumption in kwh of this electrochemical system was calculated by eq 6 6 w k w h u i t where u and i is the recorded voltage v and current i on average over the electrolysis of specific time h 3 results and discussion 3 1 proof of concept 3 1 1 function of the caco3 filled basket anode before the feasibility investigation we characterized the caco3 pellets qualitatively and quantitatively sem eds results showed that the pellets were irregular in shape and similar in size on which only calcium carbon and oxygen element were detected fig s4 its principal mineral component was calcite fig s4b and its ca content reached 38 table s2 we then investigated the feasibility of this caco3 packed basket shaped anode in limiting h oh recombination preserving oh and providing ca2 under 1 8 a m2 the bulk ph increased from 6 5 to 10 5 after 8 h of treatment fig 1b theoretically anodic water oxidation and cathodic water reduction in a single electrochemical cell will generate equal amounts of protons h and hydroxyl ions oh as a result the bulk ph will not change significantly because of h oh recombination lei et al 2019a however considering the limitation of mass diffusion the ph close to the cathode surface is always higher while the ph near the anode surface is lower than the bulk ph in our design the caco3 packed basket shaped anode allows the on site consumption of anode produced h eq 7 this means less h is released to the bulk solution thus limiting h oh recombination and leaving the cathode formed oh accumulated in the bulk solution as a result a significant increase in bulk ph from 6 5 to 10 5 was recorded fig 1b meanwhile the reaction between h and the packed caco3 particles brings ca2 into the bulk solution as confirmed by the increased ca2 concentration to 40 mg l fig 1b 7 c a c o 3 2 h c a 2 h 2 o c o 2 we further studied the behavior of packed materials in the absence of an electric current 0 ma fig s5 shows that the solution ph increased from 6 7 to 9 4 followed by an increased ca2 concentration to 5 14 mg l after 8 h these results indicate that the packed caco3 particles are slightly soluble under neutral conditions nonetheless the solution ph and ca2 concentration were much lower than at 1 8 a m2 in summary the introduction of this novel basket anode allowed the caco3 h reaction to occur within the limited anodic area and increased the ph and ca2 concentration in the cathode region which is ideal for inducing ca phosphate formation and precipitation fig 1a 3 1 2 phosphorus recovery in this basket anode electrochemical system after understanding the function of the caco3 packed basket anode we evaluated the performance of this novel system for p recovery for this purpose we supplied the feed solution with 1 0 mm po4 3 the system achieved 55 removal of p po4 3 after 8 h treatment with 1 8 a m2 fig 1c by contrast in an open circuit 0 ma no apparent removal of po4 3 was observed fig s6 this precludes the possible po4 3 removal by packed materials whether by adsorption or other mechanisms karageorgiou et al 2007 martin et al 2018 as confirmed above the packed caco3 particles in the basket shaped anode consumed the anodic produced h providing ca2 and creating a high ph environment beyond the cathode surface when phosphate is present in the feed solution it may participate in ca phosphate formation and precipitation given the ideal environment created in the caco3 packed electrochemical system indeed as shown in fig 1c the final ca2 concentration in the bulk solution was reduced significantly from 40 to 8 mg l when the feed solution contained po4 3 which is explained by ca phosphate precipitation the accumulation of oh or the high local ph in the vicinity of the cathode surface has been revealed to play a critical role in many electrochemical processes lei et al 2017 zhang and co 2020 while the direct measure of the local ph is a challenge and is not the focus of the current study we assumed the local ph close to the cathode should be at least 10 5 given the bulk ph reached 10 5 with the ca2 released from the basket anode the hydroxyapatite hap saturation index si went beyond zero rapidly it remained at a high level of saturation si 10 fig s7 indicating the solution was supersaturated concerning ca phosphate meanwhile visible white precipitates were found on the cathode surface and were confirmed to be crystalline ca phosphate from sem images of this product collected from the cathode we noticed the aggregation of spherical particles which is probably linked to amorphous calcium phosphate acp lei et al 2017 fig s8a this is further supported by the relevant element distribution fig s8 and xrd analysis fig s9 therefore an enhanced phosphate recovery in this system as ca phosphate was demonstrated to be feasible nonetheless given the release of both ca2 and bi carbonate from caco3 dissolution one may argue that caco3 can still form as a by product and co precipitate with ca phosphate indeed in previous studies we found the formation of caco3 as a by product in the presence of bi carbonate in emp systems lei et al 2019a lei et al 2018 in this case the calculation of si suggests potential caco3 generation at the final stage of the 8 h electrolysis period with a low si of 0 687 fig s7 the slightly higher ca p atomic ratio of recovered products 2 0 than typical acp 1 5 wang and nancollas 2008 also points to the formation of carbonate replaced ca phosphate or the co precipitation of caco3 minerals wang and nancollas 2008 even so the product generated in this system still had a much lower ca p ratio than those mixed with packing materials 326 8 lei et al 2019b which will be further discussed in the next chapter 3 2 boosted product quality and stabilized performance over long term operation to further explore the precipitation location of ca phosphate we performed a 70 day continuous operation with the same setup we found that almost all the p was recovered as high purity highly crystalline ca phosphate on the cathode without blending with the caco3 pellets after 70 days of use the morphology of the pellets packed inside the anode did not experience any visible change fig 2 b and f in line with the dissolution of caco3 the ca wt decreased slightly from 38 to 33 table s2 eds results could not identify detectable p on the pellets surface figs 2g and s10 consistently the analysis of the elemental composition of packed materials by icp oes after acid digestion indicated the absence of ca phosphate on the filling pellets table s2 regarding the basket anode we did not observe any visible precipitates on its surface fig 2a and e this is because a low ph environment is created in the anodic region by the water oxidation reaction fig 1a although it is difficult to measure the ph of the anode zone directly the acidic environment can be corroborated by the accelerated caco3 decomposition with the electric current provided the acidic ph environment of the basket anode region eliminated any chance of ca phosphate precipitation in its filling area and on its surface thus preventing the mixing of the phosphate products and filling materials considering that different locations in the basket anode might have different h concentrations depending on how close it is to the anode wall where electrochemical reactions occur we also compared the caco3 pellets packed deep inside the basket anode and the one close to the anode wall consistently no ca phosphate precipitates were found on the pellets surface neither for the pellets packed deep inside the anode nor the pellets close to the anode surface fig s12 and table s2 this suggests that a stable sufficient low ph area was maintained in the basket anode based on the above discussion all the removed p was recovered outside the basket anode and its packing material either by heterogeneous precipitation on the cathode and or homogeneous precipitation in bulk theoretically homogeneous precipitation could happen in bulk solution in the cathode region given an outlet ph of around 9 0 fig 3 we compared the p removal efficiency in filtrated and non filtrated outlets over the 70 day electrolysis where there is a difference it can be considered homogeneous p precipitation in bulk solution encouragingly nearly all the po4 3 was removed by heterogeneous precipitation on the cathode as seen from the equal removal of po4 3 in filtrated and non filtrated samples fig 3 this can also be inferred from the cathode entirely covered by pure white solid products fig 2h while barely any precipitate was observed elsewhere in the cell the calculation of si indicates that the bulk solution was saturated with hap nonetheless given that the local ph close to the cathode was higher than the bulk ph the si near the cathode should be higher than in the bulk solution meaning the local area provides a higher driving force for ca phosphate formation and precipitation moreover precipitating on an existing heterogeneous growth center e g the ca phosphate deposited on the cathode is more kinetically favorable than nucleation in bulk solution therefore although thermodynamic calculation projects its saturation in the bulk solution no ca phosphate precipitates were found in the bulk solution the sem images of the solid product on the cathode showed a needle like shape that is recognized as the typical morphology of hap lu et al 2005 fig 2i the hap generation can be further confirmed by the xrd spectrum fig 2j the ca p atomic ratio of the recovered solids 1 8 is also close to the theoretical ratio of hap 1 7 instead of acp found in 8 h batch experiments highly crystalline hap dominated the solid product indicating the phase transfer of amorphous to crystalline ca phosphate over long term electrolysis which agrees with classic nucleation theory voorhees 1985 this boosting effect on product purity is even more remarkable when we compare its ca p ratio 1 8 with that of the recovered product 326 8 reported in the first generation of the caco3 packed electrochemical precipitation column lei et al 2019b undoubtfully this boosted purity can be attributed to the novel cell configuration thanks to the unique basket shaped anode the ca phosphate product is no longer formed on the filling material another reason could be the low ca p ratio in the treated wastewater in this system in the steady state stage of the long term treatment from the 27th day the ca p ratio was only 0 34 under such conditions ca phosphate precipitation was more thermodynamically favorable as ca phosphate species have much lower ksp than calcium carbonate wang and nancollas 2008 during this 70 day treatment the system was able to show a high p removal trend 80 in the first few days and this removal trend generally declined until it stabilized at around 40 from the 27th day fig 3 it also exhibited stable performance of the ph regulation in catholyte fig 3 distinguishing the low ph region anode and the high ph region cathode overall these results demonstrated that this system has good stability even under long term operation and it avoided mixing recovered ca phosphate with packing materials we noticed that the p removal efficiency was significantly correlated with ca2 concentration in the system throughout the 70 day treatment fig 3 the ca p molar ratio in the system during the steady state period was 0 34 at a ca p ratio as low as 0 34 the current density and the oh produced are no longer considered the primary rate limiting factor once ca2 was released ca2 were preferably used for ca phosphate precipitation since hap has a considerably low ksp 1 10 117 therefore the released amount of ca2 determines the p removal efficiency during the start up the release of ca2 was faster because the packing material always contained some easy to acidify parts of caco3 wang et al 2006 once those parts were dissolved the ca2 release became stable and so did the p removal therefore to further improve the p removal performance future studies could focus on intensifying the caco3 h reaction by proposing novel electrode configurations or applying acid vulnerable packing materials 3 3 influences of operating conditions on system s performance we studied the influence of current density on the performance of this electrochemical system using synthetic wastewater in batch mode and noteworthy the synthetic wastewater did not contain ca2 fig 4 a shows that the p removal efficiency is significantly correlated with the current density applied when the current density was increased from 0 9 to 1 8 a m2 the p removal after 8 h treatment soared from 5 9 to 54 5 previous studies have explained the mechanism behind this the applied current density has a significant impact on the oh concentration close to the cathode obata et al 2020 wang et al 2021 the saturation of ca phosphate species can be regulated by the current density applied in this system the water oxidation at the basket anode was also intensified by the enhanced current density bringing down the local ph inside the anode chamber the accelerated ca2 release and its enhanced electromigration to the cathode induced by the increased current density provided extra driving forces for ca phosphate precipitation indeed although substantially more phosphate was removed the remaining ca2 concentration in 1 8 a m2 9 5 mg l was higher than for 0 9 a m2 4 3 mg l after 8 h electrolysis fig 4c the influence of current density also highlights the importance of ca2 concentration relevant to phosphate in the case of 1 8 a m2 there was hardly p removal until 2 h because ca2 was still being released and accumulated fig 4c moreover although the p removal rate increased significantly from 2 h onwards at the end of the electrolysis the low ca concentration 9 5 mg l ca vs 13 9 mg l p in this system still limited p recovery luckily real wastewater always contains enough ca2 for example domestic wastewater influent has a typical ca2 concentration above 20 mg l van den brink et al 2009 meaning ca ions will no longer be a limiting factor in real cases we found that further increasing the current onefold to 3 6 a m2 only contributed to a 21 1 increase in p removal from 54 5 to 75 6 the power consumption was raised from 48 6 to 80 8 kwh kg p accordingly fig s14 suggesting that more energy was consumed by reactions other than ca phosphate precipitation in the caco3 packed electrochemical system ca2 po4 3 oh and bi carbonate ions are involved in this precipitation process and ca phosphate precipitation is a ph and concentration dependent process compared to a higher current density 3 6 a m2 at a current density of 1 8 a m2 oh is a limiting factor and ca phosphate precipitation dominates since the ksp of hap 1 10 117 wang and nancollas 2008 is much lower than that of caco3 3 36 10 9 zeng et al 2020 however when the current density was set at a higher level say 3 6 a m2 things may be completely different as oh may not be a limiting factor anymore on top of enhanced ca2 release and phosphate removal the increase of current density also brings more co3 2 to the bulk solution along with ca phosphate formation caco3 may take charge and become the main by product especially after the drop of p concentration by boosted p removal at enhanced current density the involvement of carbonate precipitation was evidenced by the ca p molar ratio of the derived products table s1 overall increasing the current density can promote ca release at the anode and intensify the high ph environment at the cathode by which an enhanced p removal can be achieved however an exceeded current density can still lead to substantial power consumption and by product formation that often occurs in emp systems wang et al 2021 3 3 1 influence of packing materials size to further limit the h oh recombination improve the oh utilization and enhance p recovery the caco3 h interaction needs to be intensified one efficient way to do that is by increasing the specific surface area of the pellets lei et al 2019b for which we ground the caco3 pellets to a smaller size of 2 4 mm in this way the ph and ca2 concentration increased remarkably fig 4e and f likewise the p removal was significantly improved from 54 5 to 89 7 fig 4d meanwhile the corresponding energy consumption was reduced by nearly half from 48 6 to 29 8 kwh kg p fig s15 regardless of the pellet size the electrochemical production of hydroxyl ions remained at the same level as long as the current intensity was not altered at a level of local ph under 1 8 a m2 ca phosphate has the potential to precipitate first lei et al 2018 with more ca2 and oh brought by the ground caco3 pellets the ca phosphate precipitation was selectively boosted with constant energy output reflected as a significantly reduced power consumption fig s15 and a recovered product less interfered with by products table s1 considering this enhancing the mass transfer of packing materials and anode derived h such as changing flow patterns or packing materials properties may be a promising way to optimize this system further 3 3 2 influence of inlet p concentration we further investigated the performance of this system in treating influents with different p concentrations this system showed promising recovery efficiency and stability in treating influents with various p concentrations fig 4g shows that when treating 2 0 mm p influent at 1 8 a m2 the p removal efficiency in 8 h was 25 5 and this value rose to 54 4 when 1 0 mm p influent was supplied the treatment of 0 2 mm p influent which is in the typical range for untreated domestic wastewater showed a remarkable removal of 91 4 in 8 h this is in line with what we observed in previous emp systems the lower the influent p concentration the higher the removal efficiency chen et al 2021 lei et al 2021b as expected no further improvement was observed in treating influents with shallow p concentration 0 03 mm this is related to the precipitation nature of ca phosphate species due to weakened buffering capacity the bulk ph was higher when 0 03 mm po4 3 was presented in the feed solution fig 4h however the si was lower than in the case of 0 2 mm due to the shortage of po4 3 availability fig s17 nonetheless this system reached more than 50 p removal while treating low p influents 0 03 mm notably this was not due to adsorption by the packed material fig s18 where required we can improve the system s performance further in treating low p containing wastewater by prolonging the induction time or increasing the current intensity in light of the working principle of caco3 packed basket anode ca oh 2 and other chemicals e g mgo based chemical precipitation process are possible alternatives as they increase the solution ph and provide cations for phosphate precipitation table s4 summarizes the chemical precipitation methods and electrochemical phosphorus recovery technologies compared to the present basket anode electrochemical system regarding the type of wastewater cost and product quality although parameter dependent the basket anode electrochemical system showed a comparable p removal efficiency 89 7 with existing techniques notably high purity recyclable solid was generated in the basket anode electrochemical system instead of the low purity sludge with poor settleability and filterability reported in chemical precipitation table s4 which significantly facilitates the collection and reuse of recovered products since no chemical dosage is required in this automatic system the operation cost of this electrochemical system is mainly electricity consumption calculated to be 2 5 kg p recovered which is competitive with chemical precipitation 2 8 8 9 kg p as well table s4 overall we can conclude that while the basket anode electrochemical system is still in its early stage it has already shown some advantages over chemical precipitation 3 4 performance toward real wastewater and economic analysis we further explored the effectiveness of this system in treating actual p rich wastewater stored urine fig 5 and table s3 show that 86 7 of p was recovered from stored urine in 12 h extra ca2 provided by the h caco3 reaction from the basket anode and the raised ph contributed to this very high p recovery efficiency although urea hydrolysis brought massive carbonate during storage udert et al 2003 and inevitably had a negative impact on the product purity all p was recovered as p rich products table s3 ready to be collected at the cathode the effluent ph after 12 h treatment was 7 9 which was within the accepted range of treated wastewater or influent for further biological treatment this system showed an energy consumption of 30 4 kwh kg p in treating real urine which is comparable with other advanced electrochemical techniques table s4 such as flow electrode capacitive deionization 27 8 kwh kg p xu et al 2020 and far lower than electrohydromodulation 63 5 202 4 kwh kg p perera et al 2020 mg electrocoagulation 1320 kwh kg p govindan et al 2021 and the emp process 4399 kwh kg p cid et al 2018 not to mention the greatly enhanced product quality an economic analysis based on the electricity consumption urine treating margin and revenue from phosphate products is provided in table s5 and text s1 it is estimated that an operational cost of 0 14 is required for treating 1 m3 stored urine revenues of urine treatment and phosphate product selling are estimated to be 0 22 and 0 08 respectively from treating 1 m3 urine consequently a gross profit of 0 16 m3 urine treated or 3 23 kg p recovered is obtained overall the preliminary finance calculation based on electrical operational costs suggested that this basket anode electrochemical system is technically and economically feasible for p recovery from real wastewater 4 conclusions electrochemical systems are promising for on site decentralized chemical free wastewater treatment and resource recovery including phosphate removal and recovery membranes are often used in electrochemical systems to increase the system s efficiency however the upscaling of membrane based electrochemical methods is often limited by membrane fouling and scaling we here reported a new cell architecture for a highly efficient membrane less electrochemical system for phosphate removal and recovery characterized by a unique basket shaped anode with caco3 packing we showed that the caco3 basket anode played a membrane like function dividing the electrochemical cell into a low ph anode region and a high ph cathode region the packed caco3 particles consumed the anode produced h alleviated the oh depletion and provided extra ca2 for ca phosphate precipitation the derived low ph anode region and the reinforced cathode environment eliminated ca phosphate mixing with filling materials nearly 100 of the removed p was collected from the cathode in high purity highly crystalline ca phosphate products notably the p removal performance was significantly correlated with the ca2 supply and ultimately bound with the caco3 h interaction thus higher p removal efficiency and lower energy consumption are expected by boosting the interaction between filling materials and the anode derived h for instance we may optimize electrode configuration or apply acid vulnerable packing materials the unique functions of the basket anode allow its application to be extended to other precipitation based recovery technologies for resource recovery or even other applications such as heavy metal removal we believe this research opens new possibilities to and beyond the development of emp techniques for phosphate recovery and provides an easily scalable system characterized by high efficiency low energy consumption

15089,ammonium nh4 retention removal processes in groundwater are of great interest because of the continuous increase in nitrogenous compound loading due to anthropogenic activities however the transition of multiple co occurring transformation processes that determine the fate of nh4 in groundwater along a redox gradient remains underexplored we selected a high nitrogen n groundwater system in the western hetao basin china to identify and quantify nh4 source and sink processes including mineralization dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra nitrification and anammox to better understand the dynamics of nh4 based on redox sensitive parameters that is the oxidation reduction potential orp and nh4 and nitrate no3 contents etc the groundwater system was classified into three zones from upstream to downstream zone i oxidizing zone ii moderately reducing and zone iii strongly reducing using the 15n tracing technique we found that nh4 was mainly produced by mineralization while 2 was produced by dnra throughout the study area mineralization increased downstream because the supply of biodegradable n containing compounds was augmented which created a strong redox gradient to host a serial reaction chain in zone i nh4 was mainly transferred to no3 via nitrification whereas in zones ii and iii nh4 was mainly transferred to n2 via anammox the average nh4 production consumption ratios p c in zones i ii and iii were 0 7 6 9 and 51 1 respectively obviously the nh4 purification ability can only exceed the supply under aerobic conditions thus suggesting that nh4 will accumulate without limitation and be retained in strongly reducing groundwater the situation of nh4 accumulation would deteriorate over space and time in groundwater as human activities increase without an additional artificial supply of oxidants the results provide mechanistic insights for quantitatively comprehending the dynamics and fate of nh4 in groundwater shedding light on groundwater nh4 mitigation techniques graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords groundwater redox gradient nitrogen isotope mineralization nitrification ammonium 1 introduction groundwater is the largest freshwater resource accessible to inland areas and plays a central role in the drinking water supply and agricultural irrigation hiscock et al 2002 xin et al 2019 however in recent years high levels of ammonium nh4 in groundwater have become a serious environmental concern worldwide who 2017 nh4 contaminated groundwater not only affects drinking water security due to the conversion of nh4 into nitrite no2 nitrate no3 carcinogenic trihalomethanes and organochlorines tekerlekopoulou et al 2013 who 2017 but also induces negative ecological and climatic consequences for example nh4 rich groundwater input causes greater oxygen consumption and nitrous oxide n2o emissions in aquatic systems buss et al 2004 yoshikawa et al 2015 therefore understanding the sources and sinks of nh4 in groundwater systems and determining how the groundwater system purifies nh4 are critical for the well being of human society from multiple perspectives analogous to other environments nh4 in groundwater is primarily sourced from the mineralization of nitrogen n containing organic matter om covatti et al 2021 recently growing evidence has indicated that dissimilatory no3 reduction to nh4 dnra can also be a significant source of nh4 in groundwater systems under reducing conditions rütting et al 2008 giblin et al 2013 jahangir et al 2017 in terms of sink processes the attenuation of nh4 occurs in many ways an important sink process is nitrification nh4 no2 no3 under oxic conditions the final product of nitrification no3 is vital for denitrification no3 no2 n2o n2 another important nh4 consumption process in groundwater is anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox which mainly includes anammox nh4 no2 no3 n2 and feammox 2nh4 6fe3 n2 6fe2 6h clark et al 2008 moore et al 2011 xiong et al 2022 these source sink processes are driven by different microorganisms under suitable redox conditions to determine the fate of nh4 li et al 2017 covatti et al 2021 however quantitative characterization of the transition of multiple transformation processes associated with nh4 in groundwater along a redox gradient remains scarce the natural abundance of stable isotopes such as δ15n nh4 or δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 has often been used to identify n sources in groundwater or probe source sink processes of nh4 in groundwater carrey et al 2021 gao et al 2021 aharoni et al 2022 however the natural abundance of isotopes does not provide conclusive results for determining the fate of nh4 because various n in and out transfer processes co occur for example nitrification anammox consumes 14n nh4 while leaving 15n nh4 while mineralization dnra provides 14n nh4 to draw down δ15n nh4 scheiber et al 2016 nikolenko et al 2018 genomic methods in which researchers can detect specific functional genes such as nitrifiers anammox bacteria and ammonification microbes co existing in groundwater are not conclusive either and whether the genes are all active and the magnitude of their quantitative contribution to specific n flow remains uncertain li et al 2017 xiu et al 2020 recently the application of the 15n pulse tracing technique in groundwater has developed rapidly because the addition of a 15n containing reactant can trace the rate of a specific n process by measuring the 15n composition in the product or reactant by measuring the 15n increments in the product moore et al 2011 quantified the contribution of anammox to n loss 18 36 and jahangir et al 2017 first quantified the contribution of dnra to no3 consumption in groundwater 14 63 by measuring the 15n and 14n changes in the reactant so called dilution method the regeneration gross mineralization and dnra and consumption rates gross nitrification and anammox of nh4 were determined blackburn 1979 wang et al 2018 another advanced 15n pulse tracing method proposed by xu et al 2017 showed that when considering the 15n and 14n changes in both reactant and product inventories multiple in and out n flows can be resolved simultaneously nevertheless limited field data are available on the source and sink processes for the nh4 pool which hampers our understanding of nh4 turnover in groundwater and prevents the development of relevant mitigation techniques hetao is a typical arid semi arid basin in inland china that is characterized by high concentrations of n no3 up to 3000 µm nh4 up to 400 µm in groundwater li et al 2017 xiu et al 2020 previous hydrogeological biogeochemical and microbiological investigations in this region have categorized three to four partitions and presented distinct n isotopic compositions in accordance with the redox status in groundwater jia et al 2014 xiu et al 2020 gao et al 2021 however the succession of nh4 transformation processes with respect to the retention and removal of the nh4 pool remains underexplored along redox gradients using 15n addition 15nh4 15no3 methods we conducted a series of incubation experiments for groundwater in the field and considered the 15n and 14n changes in both reactant and product inventories therefore we simultaneously determined the near in situ rates of dnra mineralization nitrification and anammox the objectives of this study were to i identify the primary source and sink processes controlling the nh4 pool and ii reveal the purification time and fate of nh4 and its environmental implications along a redox gradient in groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description our research area is located in inner mongolia in the western part of the hetao basin china cropland and grasslands were the dominant land use types john et al 2009 the sampling transects approximately 10 km in length were designed along a representative groundwater flow path from the alluvial fan front of the langshan mountains to the flat plain in the southeast fig 1 a and table s1 the alluvial fan sediments are mainly composed of sand and sandy silt whereas the flat plain sediments are mainly composed of silt and clay guo et al 2008 jia et al 2014 clay layers at several meters thick was observed on the flat plain at approximately 40 m below the land surface bls li et al 2005 guo et al 2008 meanwhile alluvial fan groundwater has been reported to contain high no3 concentrations while flat plains have been reported to have high nh4 concentrations li et al 2017 xiu et al 2020 the depth of the groundwater table generally decreases from around 20 m bls in the alluvial fans to around 2 m bls in the flat plain where the topography is gentle and aquifer sediments contain low permeability and the flow velocities averaged 20 m yr 1 in the alluvial fan 10 m yr 1 in the transition area and decreased to 5 m yr 1 in the flat plain with porosity 0 25 institute of hydrogeology and environmental geology 2014 in the entire region groundwater has no exfiltration and surface flow the groundwater is recharged mostly by vertical infiltration of precipitation irrigation channels and irrigation water and it is discharged mainly via evapotranspiration and pumping guo et al 2008 gao et al 2021 2 2 sample collection in july 2019 12 groundwater stations were selected from tube wells with a depth range of 18 100 m and assigned the names g1 through g12 along the groundwater flow path fig 1a and table s1 these wells were divided into shallow wells designated as s 40 m bls confined and deep wells designated as d 40 m bls confined under meter thick organic mud layers jia et al 2014 before sampling groundwater was pumped out from the wells for 20 min until the water oxidation reduction potential orp was stable horiba w 23x d japan dissolved oxygen do concentration was measured using an oxygen transmitter presens germany three 50 ml centrifuge tubes flacon germany were used to perform the nutrient assays including nh4 no3 no2 and total dissolved n tdn and natural 15n abundance assays including δ15n nh4 δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 using water samples filtered through 0 2 µm syringe filters samples for particulate n pn concentrations were subsampled into 1 l high density polyethylene bottles which were acid washed and rinsed with groundwater a glass fiber filter gf 75 25 mm advantec japan was used for particulate n collection under a pressure of 200 mmhg samples of dissolved organic carbon doc were collected into 125 ml borosilicate serum bottles cnw germany with the instant addition of concentrated 1 v v hno3 to lower the ph to 2 the sub samples were collected into 250 ml brown borosilicate serum bottles cnw germany and transported to the laboratory at 4 c for the bicarbonate hco3 analysis 2 3 field 15n addition incubation experiments at sampling stations samples for 15n addition 15nh4 15no3 tracing incubation were subsampled into acid washed pre combusted 450 c for 4 h 50 ml borosilicate serum bottles cnw germany notably all samples were collected via a tygon tube saint gobain france directly from the pump and each sampling bottle was filled to the top and overflowed by three times its volume to minimize the introduction of bubbles the borosilicate serum bottles were sealed with 20 mm butyl stoppers cnw germany and aluminum seals wheaton usa 15n tracer addition was conducted immediately after the sample was sealed all incubation samples were carried out in triplicate for each type of treatment and kept at approximately in situ temperature 15 c 20 c all processes were implemented in the dark throughout the collection and incubation period fig 1b d by measuring the 15n and 14n contents in the 15nh4 addition treatment 15nh4 dilution method we determined the gross production and consumption rates for nh4 we determined the rates of nitrification by measuring the product δ15n nox no3 no2 of the 15nh4 addition treatment and we determined the dnra by measuring the product of δ15n nh4 in the 15no3 addition treatment fig 1c d the rates of nh4 gross production consumption and nitrification were determined by injection of 0 1 0 3 ml 10 25 mm 15n nh4cl 98 atoms 15n sigma aldrich into the incubation bottle to reach final concentrations of 2 150 µm which ranged from 14 to 32 of the initial ambient nh4 concentrations fig 1c d and table s1 for the dnra rates 0 1 0 3 ml 10 25 mm 15n kno3 98 atoms 15n sigma aldrich was injected to reach final concentrations of 2 600 µm which ranged from 10 to 31 of the initial ambient no3 concentrations fig 1c d and table s2 details on the percentages added can be found in the supporting information table s2 samples for the controls at time zero t0 were collected immediately after tracer addition briefly 40 ml of groundwater filtrate was collected by filtering through a 0 2 µm syringe filter fig 1d the remaining bottles including those for t1 and t2 were incubated for 22 96 h and terminated by following the protocols for t0 samples all water and filter samples were stored at 20 c 2 4 chemical measurements the nh4 concentrations were measured using the indophenol blue spectrophotometric method based on a detection limit of 0 5 μm the no2 and no3 concentrations were measured using a four channel continuous flow technicon aa3 auto analyzer bran lube gmbh based on quantification ranges from 40 nm to 6 4 µm and 1 µm to 160 µm respectively with a precision better than 1 han et al 2021 the tdn and pn concentrations were determined based on the wet chemical oxidation method using purified persulfate as an oxidizing reagent knapp et al 2005 the concentrations of oxidized no3 were subsequently measured using the chemiluminescence method braman hendrix 1989 xu et al 2017 which had a precision of 5 within the range of the measured tdn concentrations don was calculated as the difference between the tdn and din nh4 no2 no3 and doc was determined using a shimadzu toc vcph analyzer detection limit 0 3 µm c using the acid base titration methods to measure the phenolphthalein alkalinity and methyl orange alkalinity respectively then the hco3 content was calculated by the calculation method of basicity 2 5 isotopic composition measurements to determine the δ15n for nh4 and no3 for natural isotopes or rate calculations no2 was initially removed from the samples by adding sulfamic acid 99 sulfamic acid sigma aldrich granger sigman 2009 when no2 was 0 1 µm to determine the δ15n contents nh4 was first quantitatively oxidized to no2 by hypobromite bro sigma aldrich at ph 12 after the addition of sodium arsenate to consume the excess bro the ph was adjusted to neutral using 10 m naoh then no2 was converted to n2o using a helium purged 1 1 v v solution of 2 m nan3 sodium azide sigma aldrich and 20 acetic acid following the method of zhang and altabet 2007 at the 40 nm n level the accuracy was 0 4 pooled standard deviation n 84 based on nearly one hundred replicates for four certified standards nh4 2so4 usgs 25 δ15n 29 4 iaea n 1 δ15n 0 4 iaea n 2 δ15n 20 3 and usgs 26 δ15n 53 7 the δ15n of nox no3 no2 for nitrification and the natural isotopes of δ15n no3 were measured using the denitrifier method sigman et al 2001 casciotti et al 2002 briefly pseudomonas aureofaciens atcc 13985 quantitatively converted nox to nitrous oxide n2o at the 20 nm n level the accuracy was

8 all isotopic compositions of the produced n2o were measured using a gasbench ii thermo fisher connected to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer thermo delta v advantage the δ15n values were expressed relative to atmospheric n2 using the following equation 1 δ 15 n rsam ple rsta ndard rsta ndard 1000 where r 15n 14n and rstandard refers to atmospheric n2 2 6 rate calibrations 2 6 1 gross nh4 production and consumption rates the calculation of nh4 gross production and consumption rates was based on the blackburn caperon model dilution method blackburn 1979 caperpon et al 1979 the pool of nh4 as s t changed over time fig s1a c and table s2 in the 15nh4 addition experiments because of the constant production rate p and consumption rate c which was expressed as follows 2 ds dt p c 3 s t s 0 p c t where s0 is the initial nh4 concentration 4 r 15 n 15 n 14 n where r is the 15n relative abundance of the measurable quantity of δ15n nh4 5 d 15 n dt p 15 n c r 6 d 14 n dt p 1 15 n c 1 r let 15 n be the naturally occurring relative abundance of 15n 15 n 0 00367 then after simplifying eqs 4 5 and 6 the equation for the change in relative 15n abundance is as follows 7 dr dt 15 n r p s this solution can be integrated using eq 3 for s and eq 7 can be written as follows 8 ln r 15 n ln r 0 15 n p p c ln s 0 p c t s 0 in the experiments s t and r t were monitored at different time points and s0 and r 0 were determined the two linear eqs 3 and 8 point to two easy estimates of p c and p p c respectively from these estimates the rate parameters p and c were calculated 2 6 2 nh4 related transformation rate for each process the nitrification and dnra reaction rates were determined based on the accumulation of 15n in the product pool relative to the initial t0 condition then for each process we obtained an incubation time series of 15n product concentrations fig s1 and table s2 for all incubation experiments the 15n product showed good linearity in the incubation time series r2 0 907 fig s1 while the rates were calculated based on the increment between the t0 and t1 point since the early stage is more reflective of the in situ situation finally by combining the equation below with the basic assumptions we obtained the rates of nitrification and dnra 9 ρ c t n t c 0 n 0 t 1 r 15 where ρ is the rate of n processing nm n h 1 ct and c0 are the product concentrations at time t and 0 of the incubation respectively r 15 is the at 15n value of the substrate pool r 15 no3 for dnra and r 15 nh4 for nitrification after tracer addition in which r 15 nh4 is corrected by determining the δ15n nh4 because of the large variation in nh4 pools nt and n0 are the at 15n values of the product pool at time t and 0 of the incubation respectively and t is the duration of the incubation in hours the detailed time series data of ct c0 nt n0 and r 15 for the addition of 15nh4 and 15no3 are listed in the supporting information table s2 meanwhile the gross nh4 production rate represented the sum of mineralization and dnra and the gross nh4 consumption rate represented the sum of nitrification and anammox fig 1b d thus we can use eqs 10 and 11 to calculate the mineralization and anammox rates respectively mineralization rates gross nh4 production rates dnra rates 10 anammox rates gross nh4 consumption rates nitrification rates 11 notably the above represents an indirect method for obtaining the anammox rate this rate is calculated as the sum of anaerobic ammonia oxidation with various electron acceptors such as no2 no3 and fe3 clark et al 2008 tekerlekopoulou et al 2013 xiong et al 2022 2 7 statistical analysis principal components analysis pca based on the groundwater redox active chemical parameters was performed using canoco 5 0 one way analysis of variance anova was used to assess the statistical significance tests of the groundwater chemical parameters n 12 10 and nh4 transformation rates n 12 were performed by spss 22 0 software

strongly reducing from g6 d to g12 s fig 2 notably significant differences were not observed in the redox conditions between the shallow and deep wells in the same zone area fig 2 in detail the orp showed a continuous decreasing trend from positive for sites in zone i to less than 123 mv for sites in zones ii and iii fig 3 a the do concentrations was the highest up to 249 4 µm at g1 s and it dropped dramatically to 58 24 µm for all other sites regardless sampling depth and downstream distance fig 3b while the anion hco3 showed the opposite trend with the highest concentrations of 14136 µm for sites in zone iii fig 3c the highest values of no3 2964 195 µm were observed in zone i at g1 s reduced by 56 relative to g1 s at g2 d and then sharply dropped to 7 1 9 0 µm mean standard deviation

highest contents in zone i 394 5 86 5 µm in g1 s and 105 1 21 7 µm in g2 d respectively decreased to 19 0 7 9 µm n 3 in zone ii and then increased to 97 7 39 3 µm n 7 in zone iii fig 3h doc showed an opposite trend and presented the lowest value in zone i 1084 µm in g1 s and 801 µm in g2 d increased to 1340 579 µm n 3 in zone ii and reached 1804 497 µm n 7 in zone iii fig 3i notably significant differences were not observed in the don and doc concentrations between the shallow and deep wells in the same zone p 0 05 especially in zones ii and iii 3 3 natural 15n abundance in different zones the δ15n nh4 value showed an obvious decreasing trend from zone i to iii and ranges from 30 2 to 1 8 p 0 05 table s3 and the highest values were observed in zone i 18 0 1 7 in g1 s and 30 2 1 5 in g2 d respectively and they decreased to 9 0 in g4 s and 9 8 in g5 d in zone ii and ranged from 6 5 to 1 8 with a mean of 4 2 2 0 n 6 in zone iii fig 3j δ15n no3 showed a different downstream trend with δ15n no3 ranging between 8 3 and 27 6 fig 3k however the highest value of δ18o no3 8 8 1 7 in g3 d and 8 2 0 7 in g4 s respectively was observed at sites for zone ii with lower values 2 6 0 1 in g1 s and 0 9 0 1 in g2 d observed in zone i and moderate values 3 1 to 13 5 with a mean of 5 9 4 0 n 6 in zone iii fig 3l 3 4 nh4 production rates in different zones the gross nh4 production dnra and mineralization rates showed an obvious increasing trend from zones i to iii p 0 05 fig 4 gross nh4 production rates ranged from 63 4 3 4 nm n h 1 g2 d to 4832 252 nm n h 1 g10 s fig 4a the dnra rates ranged between 0 8 0 1 nm n h 1 g2 d and 51 3 3 3 nm n h 1 g10 s fig 4b and only accounted for 2 of the nh4 source in our studies fig 4d the nh4 production process was dominated by mineralization thus contributing over 98 0 and peaking at 99 6 fig 4c d in zone i the mineralization rates were lower 174 36 9 nm n h 1 in g1 s and 62 3 3 4 in g2 d nm n h 1 but increased nearly 10 fold in zone ii to 393 70 9 nm n h 1 n 3 and they continued to rise by 100 fold in zone iii to 3336 2441 nm n h 1 n 7 fig 4c 3 5 nh4 consumption rates in different zones the gross consumption rates ranged from 16 4 5 6 nm n h 1 g7 d to 272 1 48 9 nm n h 1 g1 s and did not show an obvious changing trend p 0 05 fig 5 a however the dominant process shifted from nitrification in zone i to anammox in zone ii and iii fig 5d in zone ⅰ nitrification accounted for 64 of the gross nh4 consumption with the maximum value 220 66 5 nm n h 1 appearing at g1 s and it reduced to 40 8 5 6 nm n h 1 in g2 d and then sharply dropped to 4 6 7 8 nm n h 1 n 10 for sites at zone ii and iii fig 5b d however in zones ii and iii the main nh4 consumption process was anammox which accounted for 71 g9 d to 99 g6 d of the gross nh4 consumption the rates of anammox showed a slightly increasing trend from 57 2 82 6 nm n h 1 in zone i to 60 5 26 0 nm n h 1 in zone ii and 76 9 62 9 nm n h 1 in zone iii fig 5c d 4 discussion 4 1 om supply induced mineralization modulates the nh4 pool in groundwater in our study area the gross nh4 production rates varied by two orders of magnitude from 63 4 3 3 to 4832 251 nm n h 1 fig 4a and more than 98 of the production was contributed by mineralization while only 2 was produced by dnra fig 4d this increasing production rates trend was also accompanied by a gradual increase in nh4 from 7 to 340 µm fig 3f which accounted for 0 2 to 99 6 of tn fig 3 meanwhile the spearman correlation analysis highlighted the significant positive correlation between mineralization and nh4 concentrations nh4 r 0 78 p 0 003 fig 6 thus mineralization acts as the major source process playing a key role in maintaining or even enlarging the pool size of nh4 in the groundwater om mineralization is a biochemical process mediated by the activity of heterotrophic microorganisms involved in the depolymerization of biodegradable n containing compounds clivot et al 2017 callbeck et al 2021 in our study area high nh4 groundwater was observed in zone iii regardless of whether the well was shallow or deep fig 3f in the downstream area the om content has been reported to be high in surface and near surface sediments li et al 2017 guo et al 2008 2019 and organic rich peat units have also been observed in the subsurface qiao et al 2020 jia et al 2014 hence mineralization induced nh4 can be supported by external om sourced from the surface and internal om sourced from the deposited strata interestingly om parameters such as pn don and doc showed no statistical correlation with mineralization rates p 0 05 fig 6 insignificant statistical correlations may imply that the quality rather than the quantity of om is more directly controlling mineralization rates callbeck et al 2021 du et al 2020 2021 guo et al 2019 qiao et al 2020 alternatively n containing compounds carried by sediments rather than water may act as an n reservoir to stimulate microbial activity in clay rich sediment aquifers in zones ii and iii guo et al 2008 qiao et al 2020 in zone i where sand sediments with higher permeability i e higher conductivity to surface water for leaching have been reported guo et al 2008 jia et al 2014 thus the remarkable decreasing trends for do no3 pn don and doc into groundwater fig 3b d and g i were highly likely caused by enhanced supply however the mineralization in zone i was the lowest among the three zones the no3 values observed in zone i thousands of µm fig 3d may reflect that a large amount of biodegradable n containing compounds had been decomposed and oxidized into no3 before reaching the sampling depth this conjecture is supported by the spatial distribution of the natural δ15n abundance in zone i the δ15n nh4 values fig 3j fell within the isotopic field for anthropogenic n such as animal manure wastewater or fertilizer 7 30 michener et al 2008 scheiber et al 2016 weng et al 2017 gao et al 2021 whereas in zone iii the relative contribution of subsurface soil n would be more important because the lowest δ15n nh4 values 1 8 to 6 9 were measured in this zone and they were similar to that of the total organic n for peat soil or sediments michener and lajtha 2008 nikolenko et al 2018 in zone i the higher δ15n nh4 values could be the result of modification by microbial activities such as nitrification and the δ15n values of the dominant n species of no3 ranged between 8 3 and 10 5 fig 3k and still fell within the range of animal manure wastewater or fertilizer n 7 30 for the transition area zone ii δ15n nh4 ranged from 9 0 to 9 8 fig 3j suggesting that this zone in the middle was influenced by the factors addressed above for zones i and iii the spatial variation of δ15n supported that organic n from external anthropogenic n or internal clay soil stimulates mineralization in both oxidizing and reducing groundwater to modulate the size of the nh4 pool and its isotopic composition notably dnra was significantly correlated with mineralization r 0 73 p 0 003 fig 6 both dnra and mineralization were not only statistically correlated with nh4 dnra r 0 84 p 0 002 mineralization r 0 77 p 0 003 but also correlated with hco3 dnra r 0 73 p 0 007 mineralization r 0 80 p 0 002 and orp dnra r 0 59 p 0 04 mineralization r 0 72 p 0 008 fig 6 this phenomenon may be due to both dnra and mineralization being conducted by heterotrophic microorganisms that require organic carbon for respiration moreover dnra prefers conditions with no3 limitation limited electron acceptor and high carbon electron donor availability doc no3 ratio above 12 friedl et al 2018 putz et al 2018 thus dnra is prone to occur in zones ii and iii which presented doc no3 ratios above 67 and up to 2700 respectively table s1 nonetheless the dnra rate was still nearly two orders of magnitude lower than that of mineralization in reducing zones ii and iii this may be a result of the low no3 substrate concentration that restricted dnra 4 2 redox conditions control the nh4 sink pathway the sink processes of nh4 are equally important as the source processes for understanding the fate of nh4 nitrification and anammox are the two key processes that consume nh4 in our study area the dominant sink process shifted from nitrification in zone i to anammox in zones ii and iii fig 5 suggesting that the redox status modulated nh4 consumption pathways several previous studies have indicated that nitrification is arrested in low do groundwater 32 µm miller et al 2018 our results showed that the highest nitrification rates up to 219 nm n h 1 were observed at oxygenated g1 s and they decreased significantly to 2 1 nm n h 1 fig 5b as the do concentration decreased to 20 µm this downstream decreasing trend and the negative correlation between nitrification and do r 0 85 p 0 0001 in fig 6 illustrated that the do concentration directly affected the activities of nitrifiers in groundwater meanwhile nitrification rates were significantly positively correlated with the concentrations of no2 r 0 75 p 0 005 and no3 r 0 66 p 0 021 fig 6 indicating that nitrification may be an important source of no2 and no3 apparently as do reduces toward downstream nitrification was gradually restricted such pathway restriction slows down the production of substrates no2 no3 for anammox dnra and denitrification and simultaneously drives nh4 accumulation at the same time in contrast anammox did not show significant correlations with its substrates i e nh4 no2 no3 p 0 05 fig 6 the insignificant correlation may imply that the anammox obtained using our indirect method may include the utilization of other electron acceptors rather than no2 no3 as the main electron acceptors in reducing groundwater insoluble fe mn oxides and soluble aqueous fe mn oxides can be utilized for nh4 oxidation feammox mnammox tekerlekopoulou et al 2013 xiong et al 2022 using multiple natural 15n isotope abundances and 16s rrna sequencing previous studies in our study area confirmed that feammox may play an important role in reducing status gao et al 2021 xiu et al 2020 the lower concentrations of no3 and higher values of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 downstream relative to upstream fig 3k l also support the occurrence of no3 reduction processes although we could not quantitatively separate the relative contributions of no2 no3 and fe3 mn4 to nh4 anaerobic oxidation the importance of anammox for nh4 consumption in reducing groundwater is undisputed 4 3 fate and purification time of nh4 in different redox conditions and its environmental implications the ratio of gross production to gross consumption p c of nh4 was estimated to define the fate of nh4 that is removal or accumulation fig 7 a in zone i the gross nh4 production rates were slightly lower than the gross nh4 consumption rates thus leading to an average p c of less than 1 suggesting nh4 removal the p c value was 6 8 1 9 n 3 and 51 1 31 7 n 7 for zone ii and iii respectively fig 7a suggesting nh4 accumulation to assess the purification ability we calculated the minimum purification time for nh4 pool size gross consumption rate assuming that no nh4 production and consumption is a zero order reaction we can estimate the minimum purification times which ranged from days dozens of days month scale and up to a few hundred days year scale for the three zones fig 7b obviously the nh4 on site purification ability only exceeded production in zone i and the minimum purification time can be within a few days however the prolonged minimum purification time combined with a high p c ratio downstream suggests that nh4 will accumulate and be retained in an unlimited manner in reducing groundwater in the strongly reducing zone iii the minimum purification time for existing ambient nh4 is up to hundreds of days fig 7b and more time is required to continue the input of organic matter and associated mineralization thus the situation of nh4 accumulation would deteriorate over space and time in groundwater unless extra oxidants are artificially introduced to stimulate nh4 oxidation 4 4 mitigation for nh4 enriched groundwater in inland areas with a shortage of surface water groundwater is a critical source of potable drinking water as well as for agricultural and industrial uses hiscock et al 2002 xin et al 2019 however our results showed that reducing groundwater which is expected to expand in the future figura et al 2013 breitburg et al 2018 does not have a sufficient ability to purify nh4 fig 7 the unlimited accumulation of nh4 in groundwater highlights the urgent need for remediation although many previous studies have explored the use of biological or chemical methods to build different reactors to purify nh4 contaminated groundwater in the field or laboratory koike et al 2022 jia et al 2020 cheng et al 2017 patterson et al 2002 few studies have discussed the use of natural processes on site as mentioned earlier n containing om is from shallow surface or organic mud embedded strata at around 40 m bls guo et al 2008 jia et al 2014 and the oxidants carried by naturally infiltrating moisture from precipitation falling on the surface are obviously insufficient to reduce groundwater unless we can cut off the supply of n containing om see discussion in sections 4 1and 4 3 therefore the direct artificial injection of water with oxidants such as o2 fe mn into the aquifer may be an appropriate approach however the oxidant supply should be periodic because a continuous supply may result in no3 accumulation as shown in our results for zone i the intermittent supplementation of oxidants into groundwater can induce a natural redox gradient in groundwater in time and space thus benefiting nitrification in the oxic status and its end product will be removed subsequently via anammox or denitrification under anoxic conditions this proposed idea is simple and straightforward and includes pumping out the groundwater from the confined anoxic aquifer in zone iii and sending it a few tens of meters upstream for periodic injection after oxygen exposure or adding extra oxidants thus a small circulation cell can be built underground for n removal in the strong reducing zone iii fig 8 although this mitigation idea is still at the conceptual stage and additional investigations of the costs and benefits and potential side effects need to be carried out we believe that the proposed method will provide a useful reference and an inspiration point for further research to address this type of high nh4 groundwater overall our study provides mechanistic insights to quantitatively comprehend the dynamics and fate of nh4 in groundwater and offers insights into groundwater nh4 mitigation at the same time our results also indicate the importance of biodegradable n containing compounds in modulating the nh4 pool size and the complicated mechanisms of anammox in groundwater therefore future efforts are needed to characterize the biodegradable n containing compounds both in sediments and groundwater provide science based policies to reduce the supply of n containing om from specific sources and explore the mechanisms of n removal pathways and capacity including anammox and denitrification to help identify a cost efficient solution for remediation of high n groundwater conclusions a schematic diagram of the transition of n species source sink processes purification time and fate of nh4 in groundwater along a redox gradient is presented fig 8 based on the 15n addition tracing method as the redox changes from upstream to downstream the nh4 production pathway is mainly mineralization with 2 by dnra while the nh4 consumption process shifts from nitrification to anammox the average nh4 production consumption ratios for zones i ii and iii were 0 7 6 9 and 51 1 respectively revealing that under aerobic conditions the nh4 purification ability can exceed the supply the minimum purification times ranged from days to months and reached a year and they increased from upstream to downstream a high p c ratio and prolonged purification time suggest that nh4 accumulates continuously and is retained in the strongly reducing groundwater the n removal processes were obviously obstructed in the strongly reducing environments the situation of nh4 accumulation would deteriorate over space and time in groundwater as human activities increase without an additional artificial supply of oxidants thus indicating the importance of remediation techniques overall our study highlights that the 1 om supply induced mineralization modulates the nh4 pool size 2 nh4 is consumed via nitrification and anammox under oxidizing and reducing conditions respectively 3 consecutive mineralization creates a serial reaction chain to determine the fate of nh4 and 4 nh4 will accumulate continuously in strongly reducing groundwater unless remediation is performed declaration of competing interest the authors

15089,ammonium nh4 retention removal processes in groundwater are of great interest because of the continuous increase in nitrogenous compound loading due to anthropogenic activities however the transition of multiple co occurring transformation processes that determine the fate of nh4 in groundwater along a redox gradient remains underexplored we selected a high nitrogen n groundwater system in the western hetao basin china to identify and quantify nh4 source and sink processes including mineralization dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra nitrification and anammox to better understand the dynamics of nh4 based on redox sensitive parameters that is the oxidation reduction potential orp and nh4 and nitrate no3 contents etc the groundwater system was classified into three zones from upstream to downstream zone i oxidizing zone ii moderately reducing and zone iii strongly reducing using the 15n tracing technique we found that nh4 was mainly produced by mineralization while 2 was produced by dnra throughout the study area mineralization increased downstream because the supply of biodegradable n containing compounds was augmented which created a strong redox gradient to host a serial reaction chain in zone i nh4 was mainly transferred to no3 via nitrification whereas in zones ii and iii nh4 was mainly transferred to n2 via anammox the average nh4 production consumption ratios p c in zones i ii and iii were 0 7 6 9 and 51 1 respectively obviously the nh4 purification ability can only exceed the supply under aerobic conditions thus suggesting that nh4 will accumulate without limitation and be retained in strongly reducing groundwater the situation of nh4 accumulation would deteriorate over space and time in groundwater as human activities increase without an additional artificial supply of oxidants the results provide mechanistic insights for quantitatively comprehending the dynamics and fate of nh4 in groundwater shedding light on groundwater nh4 mitigation techniques graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords groundwater redox gradient nitrogen isotope mineralization nitrification ammonium 1 introduction groundwater is the largest freshwater resource accessible to inland areas and plays a central role in the drinking water supply and agricultural irrigation hiscock et al 2002 xin et al 2019 however in recent years high levels of ammonium nh4 in groundwater have become a serious environmental concern worldwide who 2017 nh4 contaminated groundwater not only affects drinking water security due to the conversion of nh4 into nitrite no2 nitrate no3 carcinogenic trihalomethanes and organochlorines tekerlekopoulou et al 2013 who 2017 but also induces negative ecological and climatic consequences for example nh4 rich groundwater input causes greater oxygen consumption and nitrous oxide n2o emissions in aquatic systems buss et al 2004 yoshikawa et al 2015 therefore understanding the sources and sinks of nh4 in groundwater systems and determining how the groundwater system purifies nh4 are critical for the well being of human society from multiple perspectives analogous to other environments nh4 in groundwater is primarily sourced from the mineralization of nitrogen n containing organic matter om covatti et al 2021 recently growing evidence has indicated that dissimilatory no3 reduction to nh4 dnra can also be a significant source of nh4 in groundwater systems under reducing conditions rütting et al 2008 giblin et al 2013 jahangir et al 2017 in terms of sink processes the attenuation of nh4 occurs in many ways an important sink process is nitrification nh4 no2 no3 under oxic conditions the final product of nitrification no3 is vital for denitrification no3 no2 n2o n2 another important nh4 consumption process in groundwater is anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox which mainly includes anammox nh4 no2 no3 n2 and feammox 2nh4 6fe3 n2 6fe2 6h clark et al 2008 moore et al 2011 xiong et al 2022 these source sink processes are driven by different microorganisms under suitable redox conditions to determine the fate of nh4 li et al 2017 covatti et al 2021 however quantitative characterization of the transition of multiple transformation processes associated with nh4 in groundwater along a redox gradient remains scarce the natural abundance of stable isotopes such as δ15n nh4 or δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 has often been used to identify n sources in groundwater or probe source sink processes of nh4 in groundwater carrey et al 2021 gao et al 2021 aharoni et al 2022 however the natural abundance of isotopes does not provide conclusive results for determining the fate of nh4 because various n in and out transfer processes co occur for example nitrification anammox consumes 14n nh4 while leaving 15n nh4 while mineralization dnra provides 14n nh4 to draw down δ15n nh4 scheiber et al 2016 nikolenko et al 2018 genomic methods in which researchers can detect specific functional genes such as nitrifiers anammox bacteria and ammonification microbes co existing in groundwater are not conclusive either and whether the genes are all active and the magnitude of their quantitative contribution to specific n flow remains uncertain li et al 2017 xiu et al 2020 recently the application of the 15n pulse tracing technique in groundwater has developed rapidly because the addition of a 15n containing reactant can trace the rate of a specific n process by measuring the 15n composition in the product or reactant by measuring the 15n increments in the product moore et al 2011 quantified the contribution of anammox to n loss 18 36 and jahangir et al 2017 first quantified the contribution of dnra to no3 consumption in groundwater 14 63 by measuring the 15n and 14n changes in the reactant so called dilution method the regeneration gross mineralization and dnra and consumption rates gross nitrification and anammox of nh4 were determined blackburn 1979 wang et al 2018 another advanced 15n pulse tracing method proposed by xu et al 2017 showed that when considering the 15n and 14n changes in both reactant and product inventories multiple in and out n flows can be resolved simultaneously nevertheless limited field data are available on the source and sink processes for the nh4 pool which hampers our understanding of nh4 turnover in groundwater and prevents the development of relevant mitigation techniques hetao is a typical arid semi arid basin in inland china that is characterized by high concentrations of n no3 up to 3000 µm nh4 up to 400 µm in groundwater li et al 2017 xiu et al 2020 previous hydrogeological biogeochemical and microbiological investigations in this region have categorized three to four partitions and presented distinct n isotopic compositions in accordance with the redox status in groundwater jia et al 2014 xiu et al 2020 gao et al 2021 however the succession of nh4 transformation processes with respect to the retention and removal of the nh4 pool remains underexplored along redox gradients using 15n addition 15nh4 15no3 methods we conducted a series of incubation experiments for groundwater in the field and considered the 15n and 14n changes in both reactant and product inventories therefore we simultaneously determined the near in situ rates of dnra mineralization nitrification and anammox the objectives of this study were to i identify the primary source and sink processes controlling the nh4 pool and ii reveal the purification time and fate of nh4 and its environmental implications along a redox gradient in groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description our research area is located in inner mongolia in the western part of the hetao basin china cropland and grasslands were

mountains to the flat plain in the southeast fig 1 a and table s1 the alluvial fan sediments are mainly composed of sand and sandy silt whereas the flat plain sediments are mainly composed of silt and clay guo et al 2008 jia et al 2014 clay layers at several meters thick was observed on the flat plain at approximately 40 m below the land surface bls li et al 2005 guo et al 2008 meanwhile alluvial fan groundwater has been reported to contain high no3 concentrations while flat plains have been reported to have high nh4 concentrations li et al 2017 xiu et al 2020 the depth of the groundwater table generally decreases from around 20 m bls in the alluvial fans to around 2 m bls in the flat plain where the topography is gentle and aquifer sediments contain low permeability and the flow

conducted immediately after the sample was sealed all incubation samples were carried out in triplicate for each type of treatment and kept at approximately in situ temperature 15 c 20 c all processes were implemented in the dark throughout the collection and incubation period fig 1b d by measuring the 15n and 14n contents in the 15nh4 addition treatment 15nh4 dilution method we determined the gross production and consumption rates for nh4 we determined the rates of nitrification by measuring the product δ15n nox no3 no2 of the 15nh4 addition treatment and we determined the dnra by measuring the product of δ15n nh4 in the 15no3 addition treatment fig 1c d the rates of nh4 gross production consumption and nitrification were determined by injection of 0 1 0 3 ml 10 25 mm 15n nh4cl

µm and 1 µm to 160 µm respectively with a precision better than 1 han et al 2021 the tdn and pn concentrations were determined based on the wet chemical oxidation method using purified persulfate as an oxidizing reagent knapp et al 2005 the concentrations of oxidized no3 were subsequently measured using the chemiluminescence method braman hendrix 1989 xu et al 2017 which had a precision of 5

s 0 p c t where s0 is the initial nh4 concentration 4 r 15 n 15 n 14 n where r is the 15n relative abundance of the measurable quantity of δ15n nh4 5 d 15 n dt p 15 n c r 6 d 14 n dt p 1 15 n c 1 r let 15 n be the naturally occurring relative abundance of 15n 15 n 0 00367 then after simplifying eqs 4 5 and 6 the equation for the change in relative 15n abundance is as follows 7 dr dt 15 n r p s this solution can be integrated using eq 3 for s and eq 7 can be written as follows 8 ln r 15 n ln r 0 15 n p p c ln s 0 p c t s 0 in the experiments s t and r t were monitored at different time points and s0 and r 0 were determined the two linear eqs 3 and 8 point to two easy estimates of p c and p p c respectively from these estimates the rate parameters p and c were calculated 2 6 2 nh4 related transformation rate for each process the nitrification and dnra reaction rates were determined based on the accumulation of 15n in the product pool relative to the initial t0 condition then for each process we obtained an incubation time series of 15n product concentrations fig s1 and table s2 for all incubation experiments the 15n product showed good linearity in the incubation time series r2 0 907 fig s1 while the rates were calculated based on the increment between the t0 and t1 point since the early stage is more reflective of the in situ situation finally by combining the equation below with the basic assumptions we obtained the rates of nitrification and dnra 9 ρ c t n t c 0 n 0 t 1 r 15 where ρ is the rate of n processing nm n h 1 ct and c0 are the product concentrations at time t and 0 of the incubation respectively r 15 is the at 15n value of the substrate pool r 15 no3 for dnra and r 15 nh4 for nitrification after tracer addition in which r 15 nh4 is corrected by determining the δ15n nh4 because of the large variation in nh4 pools nt and n0 are the at 15n values of the product pool at time t and 0 of the incubation respectively and t is the duration of the incubation in hours the detailed time series data of ct c0 nt n0 and r 15 for the addition of 15nh4 and 15no3 are listed in the supporting information table s2 meanwhile the gross nh4 production rate represented the sum of mineralization and dnra and the gross nh4 consumption rate represented the sum of nitrification and anammox fig 1b d thus we can use eqs 10 and 11 to calculate the mineralization and anammox rates respectively mineralization rates gross nh4 production rates dnra rates 10 anammox rates gross nh4 consumption rates nitrification rates 11 notably the above represents an indirect method for obtaining the anammox rate this rate is calculated as the sum of anaerobic ammonia oxidation with various electron acceptors such as no2 no3 and fe3 clark et al 2008

these redox sensitive parameters i e orp do hco3 no3 no2 and nh4 according to the pca these parameters displayed three distinct zones from upstream to downstream as the distance from the langshan mountains increased accordingly three zones were characterized zone i alluvial fan oxidizing g1 s and g2 d zone ii transition area moderately reducing g3 d g4 s and g5 d and zone iii flat plain strongly reducing from g6 d to g12 s fig 2 notably significant differences were not observed in the redox conditions between the shallow and deep wells in the same zone area fig 2 in detail the orp showed a continuous decreasing trend from positive for sites in zone i to less than 123 mv for sites in zones ii and iii fig 3 a the do concentrations was the highest up to 249 4 µm at g1 s and it dropped dramatically to 58 24 µm for all other sites regardless sampling depth and downstream distance fig 3b while the anion hco3 showed the opposite trend with the highest concentrations of 14136 µm for sites in zone iii fig 3c the highest values of no3 2964 195 µm were observed in zone i at g1 s reduced by 56 relative to g1 s at g2 d and then sharply dropped to 7 1 9 0 µm mean standard deviation

respectively in zone i and sharp decreases to 0 3 0 3 µm n 3 and 0 6 0 8 µm n 7 for zone ii and iii respectively fig 3e the nh4 concentrations showing an obviously increasing trend from zone i to iii

highest contents in zone i 394 5 86 5 µm in g1 s and 105 1 21 7 µm in g2 d respectively decreased to 19 0 7 9 µm n 3 in zone ii and then increased to 97 7 39 3 µm n 7 in zone iii fig 3h doc showed an opposite trend and presented the lowest value in zone i 1084 µm in g1 s and 801 µm in g2 d increased to 1340 579 µm n 3 in zone ii and reached 1804 497 µm n 7 in zone iii fig 3i notably significant differences were not observed in the don and doc concentrations between the shallow and deep wells in the same zone p 0 05 especially in zones ii and iii 3 3 natural 15n abundance in different zones the δ15n nh4 value showed an obvious decreasing trend from zone i to iii and ranges from 30 2 to 1 8 p 0 05 table s3 and the highest values were observed in zone i 18 0 1 7 in g1 s and 30 2 1 5 in g2 d respectively and they decreased to 9 0 in g4 s and 9 8 in g5 d in zone ii and ranged from 6 5 to 1 8 with a mean of 4 2 2 0 n 6 in zone iii fig 3j δ15n no3 showed a different downstream trend with δ15n no3 ranging between 8 3 and 27 6 fig 3k however the highest value of δ18o no3 8 8 1 7 in g3 d and 8 2 0 7 in g4 s respectively was observed at sites for zone ii with lower values 2 6 0 1 in g1 s and 0 9 0 1 in g2 d observed in zone i and moderate values 3 1 to 13 5 with a mean of 5 9 4 0 n 6 in zone iii fig 3l 3 4 nh4 production rates in different zones the gross nh4 production dnra and mineralization rates showed an obvious increasing trend from zones i to iii p 0 05 fig 4 gross nh4 production rates ranged from 63 4 3 4 nm n h 1 g2 d to 4832 252 nm n h 1 g10 s fig 4a the dnra rates ranged between 0 8 0 1 nm n h 1 g2 d and 51 3 3 3 nm n h 1 g10 s fig 4b and only accounted for 2 of the nh4 source in our studies fig 4d the nh4 production process was dominated by mineralization thus contributing over 98 0 and peaking at 99 6 fig 4c d in zone i the mineralization rates were lower 174 36 9 nm n h 1 in g1 s and 62 3 3 4 in g2 d nm n h 1 but increased nearly 10 fold in zone ii to 393 70 9 nm n h 1 n 3 and they continued to rise by 100 fold in zone iii to 3336 2441 nm n h 1 n 7 fig 4c 3 5 nh4 consumption rates in different zones the gross consumption rates ranged from 16 4 5 6 nm n h 1 g7 d to 272 1 48 9 nm n h 1 g1 s and did not show an obvious changing trend p 0 05 fig 5 a however the dominant process shifted from nitrification in zone i to anammox in zone ii and iii fig 5d in zone ⅰ nitrification accounted for 64 of the gross nh4 consumption with the maximum value 220 66 5 nm n h 1 appearing at g1 s and it reduced to 40 8 5 6 nm n h 1 in g2 d and then sharply dropped to 4 6 7 8 nm n h 1 n 10 for sites at zone ii and iii fig 5b d however in zones ii and iii the main nh4 consumption process was anammox which accounted for 71 g9 d to 99 g6 d of the gross nh4 consumption the rates of anammox showed a slightly increasing trend from 57 2 82 6 nm n h 1 in zone i to 60 5 26 0 nm n h 1 in zone ii and 76 9 62 9 nm n h 1 in zone iii fig 5c d 4 discussion 4 1 om supply induced mineralization modulates the nh4 pool in groundwater in our study area the gross nh4 production rates varied by two orders of magnitude from 63 4 3 3 to 4832 251 nm n h 1 fig 4a and more than 98 of the production was contributed by mineralization while only 2 was produced by dnra fig 4d this increasing production rates trend was also accompanied by a gradual increase in nh4 from 7 to 340 µm fig 3f which accounted for 0 2 to 99 6 of tn fig 3 meanwhile the spearman correlation analysis highlighted the significant positive correlation between mineralization and nh4 concentrations nh4 r 0 78 p 0 003 fig 6 thus mineralization acts as the major source process playing a key role in maintaining or even enlarging the pool size of nh4 in the groundwater om mineralization is a biochemical process mediated by the activity of heterotrophic microorganisms involved in the depolymerization of biodegradable n containing compounds clivot et al 2017 callbeck et al 2021 in our study area high nh4 groundwater was observed in zone iii regardless of whether the well was shallow or deep fig 3f in the downstream area the om content has been reported to be high in surface and near surface sediments li et al 2017 guo et al 2008 2019 and organic rich peat units have also been observed in the subsurface qiao et al 2020 jia et al 2014 hence mineralization induced nh4 can be supported by external om sourced from the surface and internal om sourced from the deposited strata interestingly om parameters such as pn don and doc showed no statistical correlation with mineralization rates p 0 05 fig 6 insignificant statistical correlations may imply that the quality rather than the quantity of om is more directly controlling mineralization rates callbeck et al 2021 du et al 2020 2021 guo et al 2019 qiao et al 2020 alternatively n containing compounds carried by sediments rather than water may act as an n reservoir to stimulate microbial activity in clay rich sediment aquifers in zones ii and iii guo et al 2008 qiao et al 2020 in zone i where sand sediments with higher permeability i e higher conductivity to surface water for leaching have been reported guo et al 2008 jia et al 2014 thus the remarkable decreasing trends for do no3 pn don and doc into groundwater fig 3b d and g i were highly likely caused by enhanced supply however the mineralization in zone i was the lowest among the three zones the no3 values observed in zone i thousands of µm fig 3d may reflect that a large amount of biodegradable n containing compounds had been decomposed and oxidized into no3 before reaching the sampling depth this conjecture is supported by the spatial distribution of the natural δ15n abundance in zone i the δ15n nh4 values fig 3j fell within the isotopic field for anthropogenic n such as animal manure wastewater or fertilizer 7 30 michener et al 2008 scheiber et al 2016 weng et al 2017 gao et al 2021 whereas in zone iii the relative contribution of subsurface soil n would be more important because the lowest δ15n nh4 values 1 8 to 6 9 were measured in this zone and they were similar to that of the total organic n for peat soil or sediments michener and lajtha 2008 nikolenko et al 2018 in zone i the higher δ15n nh4 values could be the result of modification by microbial activities such as nitrification and the δ15n values of the dominant n species of no3 ranged between 8 3 and 10 5 fig 3k and still fell within the range of animal manure wastewater or fertilizer n 7 30 for the transition area zone ii δ15n nh4 ranged from 9 0 to 9 8 fig 3j suggesting that this zone in the middle was influenced by the factors addressed above for zones i and iii the spatial variation of δ15n supported that organic n from external anthropogenic n or internal clay soil stimulates mineralization in both oxidizing and reducing groundwater to modulate the size of the nh4 pool and its isotopic composition notably dnra was significantly correlated with mineralization r 0 73 p 0 003 fig 6 both dnra and mineralization were not only statistically correlated with nh4 dnra r 0 84 p 0 002 mineralization r 0 77 p 0 003 but also correlated with hco3 dnra r 0 73 p 0 007 mineralization r 0 80 p 0 002 and orp dnra r 0 59 p 0 04 mineralization r 0 72 p 0 008 fig 6 this phenomenon may be due to both dnra and mineralization being conducted by heterotrophic microorganisms that require organic carbon for respiration moreover dnra prefers conditions with no3 limitation limited electron acceptor and high carbon electron donor availability doc no3 ratio above 12 friedl et al 2018 putz et al 2018 thus dnra is prone to occur in zones ii and iii which presented doc no3 ratios above 67 and up to 2700 respectively table s1 nonetheless the dnra rate was still nearly two orders of magnitude lower than that of mineralization in reducing zones ii and iii this may be a result of the low no3 substrate concentration that restricted dnra 4 2 redox conditions control the nh4 sink pathway the sink processes of nh4 are equally important as the source processes for understanding the fate of nh4 nitrification and anammox are the two key processes that consume nh4 in our study area the dominant sink process shifted from nitrification in zone i to anammox in zones ii and iii fig 5 suggesting that the redox status modulated nh4 consumption pathways several previous studies have indicated that nitrification is arrested in low do groundwater 32 µm miller et al 2018 our results showed that the highest nitrification rates up to 219 nm n h 1 were observed at oxygenated g1 s and they decreased significantly to 2 1 nm n h 1 fig 5b as the do concentration decreased to 20 µm this downstream decreasing trend and the negative correlation between nitrification and do r 0 85 p 0 0001 in fig 6 illustrated that the do concentration directly affected the activities of nitrifiers in groundwater meanwhile nitrification rates were significantly positively correlated with the concentrations of no2 r 0 75 p 0 005 and no3 r 0 66 p 0 021 fig 6 indicating that nitrification may be an important source of no2 and no3 apparently as do reduces toward downstream nitrification was gradually restricted such pathway restriction slows down the production of substrates no2 no3 for anammox dnra and denitrification and simultaneously drives nh4 accumulation at the same time in contrast anammox did not show significant correlations with its substrates i e nh4 no2 no3 p 0 05 fig 6 the insignificant correlation may imply that the anammox obtained using our indirect method may include the utilization of other electron acceptors rather than no2 no3 as the main electron acceptors in reducing groundwater insoluble fe mn oxides and soluble aqueous fe mn oxides can be utilized for nh4 oxidation feammox mnammox tekerlekopoulou et al 2013 xiong et al 2022 using multiple natural 15n isotope abundances and 16s rrna sequencing previous studies in our study area confirmed that feammox may play an important role in reducing status gao et al 2021 xiu et al 2020 the lower concentrations of no3 and higher values of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 downstream relative to upstream fig 3k l also support the occurrence of no3 reduction processes although we could not quantitatively separate the relative contributions of no2 no3 and fe3 mn4 to nh4 anaerobic oxidation the importance of anammox for nh4 consumption in reducing groundwater is undisputed 4 3 fate and purification time of nh4 in different redox conditions and its environmental implications the ratio of gross production to gross consumption p c of nh4 was estimated to define the fate of nh4 that is removal or accumulation fig 7 a in zone i the gross nh4 production rates were slightly lower than the gross nh4 consumption rates thus leading to an average p c of less than 1 suggesting nh4 removal the p c value was 6 8 1 9 n 3 and 51 1 31 7 n 7 for zone ii and iii respectively fig 7a suggesting nh4 accumulation to assess the purification ability we calculated the minimum purification time for nh4 pool size gross consumption rate assuming that no nh4 production and consumption is a zero order reaction we can estimate the minimum purification times which ranged from days dozens of days month scale and up to a few hundred days year scale for the three zones fig 7b obviously the nh4 on site purification ability only exceeded production in zone i and the minimum purification time can be within a few days however the prolonged minimum purification time combined with a high p c ratio downstream suggests that nh4 will accumulate and be retained in an unlimited manner in reducing groundwater in the strongly reducing zone iii the minimum purification time for existing ambient nh4 is up to hundreds of days fig 7b and more time is required to continue the input of organic matter and associated mineralization thus the situation of nh4 accumulation would deteriorate over space and time in groundwater unless extra oxidants are artificially introduced to stimulate nh4 oxidation 4 4 mitigation for nh4 enriched groundwater in inland areas with a shortage of surface water groundwater is a critical source of potable drinking water as well as for agricultural and industrial uses hiscock et al 2002 xin et al 2019 however our results showed that reducing groundwater which is expected to expand in the future figura et al 2013 breitburg et al 2018 does not have a sufficient ability to purify nh4 fig 7 the unlimited accumulation of nh4 in groundwater highlights the urgent need for remediation although many previous studies have explored the use of biological or chemical methods to build different reactors to purify nh4 contaminated groundwater in the field or laboratory koike et al 2022 jia et al 2020 cheng et al 2017 patterson et al 2002 few studies have discussed the use of natural processes on site as mentioned earlier n containing om is from shallow surface or organic mud embedded strata at around 40 m bls guo et al 2008 jia et al 2014 and the oxidants carried by naturally infiltrating moisture from precipitation falling on the surface are obviously insufficient to reduce groundwater unless we can cut off the supply of n containing om see discussion in sections 4 1and 4 3 therefore the direct artificial injection of water with oxidants such as o2 fe mn into the aquifer may be an appropriate approach however the oxidant supply should be periodic because a continuous supply may result in no3 accumulation as shown in our results for zone i the intermittent supplementation of oxidants into groundwater can induce a natural redox gradient in groundwater in time and space thus benefiting nitrification in the oxic status and its end product will be removed subsequently via anammox or denitrification under anoxic conditions this proposed idea is simple and straightforward and includes pumping out the groundwater from the confined anoxic aquifer in zone iii and sending it a few tens of meters upstream for periodic injection after oxygen exposure or adding extra oxidants thus a small circulation cell can be built underground for n removal in the strong reducing zone iii fig 8 although this mitigation idea is still at the conceptual stage and additional investigations of the costs and benefits and potential side effects need to be carried out we believe that the proposed method will provide a useful reference and an inspiration point for further research to address this type of high nh4 groundwater overall our study provides mechanistic insights to quantitatively comprehend the dynamics and fate of nh4 in groundwater and offers insights into groundwater nh4 mitigation at the same time our results also indicate the importance of biodegradable n containing compounds in modulating the nh4 pool size and the complicated mechanisms of anammox in groundwater therefore future efforts are needed to characterize the biodegradable n containing compounds both in sediments and groundwater provide science based policies to reduce the supply of n containing om from specific sources and explore the mechanisms of n removal pathways and capacity including anammox and denitrification to help identify a cost efficient solution for remediation of high n groundwater conclusions a schematic diagram of the transition of n species source sink processes purification time and fate of nh4 in groundwater along a redox gradient is presented fig 8 based on the 15n addition tracing method as the redox changes from upstream to downstream the nh4 production pathway is mainly mineralization with 2 by dnra while the nh4 consumption process shifts from nitrification to anammox the average nh4 production consumption ratios for zones i ii and iii were 0 7 6 9 and 51 1 respectively revealing that under aerobic conditions the nh4 purification ability can exceed the supply the minimum purification times ranged from days to months and reached a year and they increased from upstream to downstream a high p c ratio and prolonged purification time suggest that nh4 accumulates continuously and is retained in the strongly reducing groundwater the n removal processes were obviously obstructed in the strongly reducing environments the situation of nh4 accumulation would deteriorate over space and time in groundwater as human activities increase without an additional artificial supply of oxidants thus indicating the importance of remediation techniques overall our study highlights that the 1 om supply induced mineralization modulates the nh4 pool size 2 nh4 is consumed via nitrification and anammox under oxidizing and reducing conditions respectively 3 consecutive mineralization creates a serial reaction chain to determine the fate of nh4 and 4 nh4 will accumulate continuously in strongly reducing groundwater unless remediation is performed declaration of competing interest the authors
