19410,phosphorus recovery from industrialized poultry operations is necessary to ensure sustainable waste management and resource consumption to realize these goals an innovative two stage process chemistry has been developed to extract nutrients from poultry litter and recover value added products over 75 phosphorus extraction was achieved by bubbling carbon dioxide into poultry litter slurries and adding strong acid to reach ph 4 5 5 5 after separating the nutrient deficient poultry litter solids and the nutrient rich liquid the extract ph was increased through aeration and strong base addition over 95 of the extracted phosphorus was recovered as solid precipitate at ph 8 5 9 0 high purity struvite and potassium struvite products were selectively recovered through ph control introduction of a calcium complexing agent and addition of magnesium chloride the nitrogen to phosphorus to potassium npk ratio of the recovered solids was controlled through aeration and ph adjustment precipitation at ph 8 5 9 0 and 10 5 11 0 resulted in npk ratios of 2 0 1 0 0 1 and 0 9 1 0 0 2 respectively the process effluent was effectively recycled as makeup water for the subsequent batch of poultry litter thereby decreasing water consumption and increasing overall nutrient recovery sequencing batch operation yielded greater than 70 phosphorus recovery within a 45 min process demonstrating the potential for this technology to alleviate nutrient pollution in agricultural settings and generate an alternative supply of phosphorus fertilizers graphical abstract image 1

bodies alexander et al 2008 epa 2017 maryna et al 2016 the nutrient loads from regions with intensive agricultural practices often drive negative environmental outcomes alexander et al 2008 this problem manifests as nutrient transport through runoff from over fertilized cropland hart et al 2004 and discharge from manure management systems mallin and cahoon 2003 passive waste management strategies such as piling composting and lagooning have been adopted by animal feeding operations afos to effectively treat organic carbon and nitrogen however the unfavorable redox chemistry of phosphorus does not allow any significant phosphorus abatement in manure management systems vendramelli et al 2016 the fate of phosphorus in agricultural systems is a growing concern due to increased eutrophication of inland water bodies le et al 2010 compounding this issue geospatially limited phosphorus reserves are being rapidly depleted due to the increasing food demand associated with the growing global population cooper et al 2011 together the environmental effects of phosphorus pollution and the economic vulnerability of phosphorus markets mandate a need for phosphorus recovery from agricultural waste in this context poultry operations are especially important due to the higher phosphorus content in poultry litter compared to other animal manures a typical nitrogen to phosphorus to potassium npk ratio for broiler i e meat producing bird litter is 0 2 1 0 0 5 mol mol mol shashvatt et al 2016 since fertilizers are usually applied to meet nitrogen targets beegle and durst 2002 mishima et al 2010 the excess phosphorus in poultry based manure represents poor resource management and raises environmental concerns about nutrient levels in agricultural runoff the state of maryland usa which contains dense poultry afos on the eastern shore of the chesapeake bay national chicken council 2010 recently limited the use of poultry litter as a soil amendment on fields with high fertility index values state of maryland 2015 the fertility index value is computed using the orthophosphate p v calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 and potassium k concentrations in soil and essentially describes the potential for phosphorus runoff following land application of fertilizers soil amendments or animal manure university of maryland extension 2006 as of march 2016 over 160 000 acres of farm fields were required to monitor soil phosphorus levels furthermore over 10 400 acres were banned from applying phosphorus containing fertilizers the initial economic impact model suggested that up to 228 000 tons of poultry litter would require active management salisbury university 2014 previous efforts to recover nutrients from poultry litter have mostly focused on mechanical thermochemical and biological treatment schemes mechanical processes have examined volume reduction through compaction and pelletization systems that increase the nutrient content per unit mass fasina et al 2006 however these systems have the inherent drawback of not modifying the npk ratio and therefore the pelletized product may still result in over application of phosphorus to agricultural fields thermochemical processing of poultry litter produces biochar that can be used for a variety of applications feed additive prasai et al 2016 soil amendment chan et al 2008 and remediation tang et al 2013 however widespread adoption of thermochemical operations does not represent a sustainable waste management solution biological processes are being increasingly employed for heat and energy recovery tiquia and tam 2002 but these systems do not have any independent benefits for treatment or recovery of phosphorus a number of processes have been developed for and applied to recover phosphorus from wastewater treatment plants blaney et al 2007 nieminen 2010 while these technologies offer viable phosphorus recovery for municipal wastewater high strength animal manure poses challenges due to the differences in inorganic chemistry organic matter load and solids content these parameters affect the extraction of phosphorus from waste solids and the form of recovered products the inorganic composition of the waste stream especially the ca2 and mg2 content influence the chemical form of recovered phosphorus high ca2 content favors precipitation of hydroxyapatite ca10 po4 6 oh 2 while higher mg2 levels promote recovery of struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o shashvatt et al 2016 the elevated levels of dissolved organic matter dom in animal waste increase the chemical demands associated with nutrient extraction and product precipitation sommer and husted 2009 furthermore dom competes with phosphorus in sorption based technologies hunt et al 2007 and complexes divalent cations needed for precipitation of nutrient laden solids yan et al 2015 as poultry litter has a lower water content than cow and swine manure wolf et al 2005 nutrient extraction from the relatively dry solids requires water consumption however large volumes of wastewater inhibit sustainable process implementation for these reasons new paradigms need to be explored with respect to nutrient recovery from high strength agricultural waste streams to date phosphorus recovery from afos has mostly focused on swine suzuki et al 2005 2007 and cattle mulbry et al 2008 wilkie and mulbry 2002 manure with only a few studies on poultry litter szögi et al 2008 yilmazel and demirer 2011 szögi et al 2008 reported 60 phosphorus recovery from poultry litter but the recovered hydroxyapatite is not an ideal agrochemical due to its low solubility wier et al 1971 yilmazel and demirer 2011 primarily focused on nitrogen recovery through addition of phosphorus and magnesium to anaerobically digested poultry litter to recover struvite and calcium phosphates however the need for an exogenous p v source may prevent widespread application in agricultural systems unlike hydroxyapatite struvite represents a slow release fertilizer with a balanced ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus under certain conditions potassium struvite mgkpo4 6h2o can also be recovered graeser et al 2008 struvite and potassium struvite can be mixed to produce nutrient laden solids with controllable npk ratios to address the shortcomings identified above the process chemistry shown in fig 1 was devised to facilitate the selective recovery of struvite and potassium struvite from poultry litter briefly poultry litter was added to water to generate a high strength slurry then phosphorus was extracted through addition of co2 g and strong acid the nutrient deficient solids were separated from the nutrient rich extract which was aerated and dosed with naoh to precipitate struvite based solids the objectives of this study were to 1 optimize the extraction of phosphorus from poultry litter as a function of ph and slurry strength 2 lower the acid base demands of the process chemistry through co2 gas bubbling aeration and 3 selectively recover struvite and potassium struvite from poultry litter to prevent production of large volumes of wastewater the process effluent was reused to generate subsequent poultry litter slurries and this recycle scheme was evaluated for impacts on nutrient extraction and precipitation efficiency the findings from this work enable sustainable recovery of nutrient balanced fertilizer products from agricultural waste streams while also preventing negative environmental outcomes associated with nutrient pollution 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals unless otherwise stated all chemicals were procured from fisher scientific hampton nh phosphate standards were prepared by adding disodium hydrogen phosphate na2hpo4 to deionized di water neu ion systems windsor mill md concentrated hydrochloric acid hcl 35 was used to prepare 1 m hcl for ph adjustment sodium hydroxide naoh 97 was dissolved in di water to generate 1 2 m naoh solutions for ph correction ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta 99 5 was obtained from sigma aldrich st louis mo and used to generate a 0 1 m edta solution at ph 8 0 a 0 1 m magnesium chloride mgcl2 6h2o 99 solution was prepared in di water for use in select precipitation experiments 2 2 poultry litter source and composition poultry litter was sourced from three different farms in the chesapeake bay watershed the litters have been anonymously labeled as pl 1 pl 2 and pl 3 before experimentation 1 kg batches of poultry litter were dried at 50 c for 3 days the dried litter was passed through stainless steel sieves with us mesh 16 1 18 mm to remove feathers woodchips bones and other debris slurries were generated by adding the dry sieved poultry litter to di water to investigate the impact of slurry strength on nutrient recovery poultry litter slurries were prepared at 4 20 and 80 g l for recycle experiments a 100 g l poultry litter slurry was employed all slurries were used within 2 h of generation total phosphorus was measured using the epa 3050b digestion method epa 1996 in accordance with previous reports szögi et al 2008 yilmazel and demirer 2011 acid hydrolysis was employed to measure the concentration of extractable phosphorus and other inorganic ions in particular the ph of a 40 g l slurry was adjusted to approximately 1 0 with 1 m hcl and the acid extractable phosphorus was measured using the stannous chloride method apha et al 2006 with a uv visible spectrophotometer thermo scientific evolution 600 waltham ma or microplate reader biotek eon winooski vt the difference in total phosphorus and acid extractable phosphorus was considered organic phosphorus inorganic phosphorus was approximately 85 of the total phosphorus in agreement with previous reports for poultry litter sharpley and moyer 2000 other inorganic ions such as ca2 mg2 k sodium na ammonium nh4 sulfate so4 2 and nitrate no3 were determined by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy perkin elmer 3100 aas waltham ma or ion chromatography dionex ics 2100 sunnyvale ca the ion chromatograph was run under isocratic conditions with 12 mm potassium carbonate anions or 32 mm methanesulfonic acid cations dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations in the poultry litter extracts were measured using a total organic carbon toc analyzer shimadzu toc l columbia md titration curves for poultry litter slurries were recorded with an autotitrator radiometer analytical tim 865 lyon france the inorganic content doc and alkalinity for 40 g l slurries of pl 1 pl 2 and pl 3 are reported in table 1 all compositional analyses were conducted in triplicate and data are reported as mean standard deviation 2 3 phosphorus extraction from poultry litter to investigate the impact of ph on phosphorus extraction 1 m hcl was added to 40 g l poultry litter slurries to generate solutions with ph values in the 1 0 7 0 range solution ph was measured using an orion ross ultra probe thermo scientific waltham ma poultry litter slurries were equilibrated under constant mixing for 30 min and then centrifuged at 5000 g for 10 min due to the high strength of these slurries the supernatant was diluted 100 1000 before p v analysis the extraction efficiency was calculated using eq 1 1 η ext ph i p v ph i p v ph 1 in eq 1 η ext ph i is the fraction of p v extracted into the water phase at ph i p v ph i is the p v concentration at ph i and p v ph 1 is the total acid extractable p v 2 4 struvite recovery from poultry litter extracts to generate nutrient rich extracts 80 g l poultry litter slurries were bubbled with co2 g for 5 min and 1 m hcl was added to reach ph 4 5 after 30 min of continuous mixing the slurry was centrifuged at 5000 g for 10 min to remove any remaining particles the supernatant was passed through 20 μm paper filters whatman maidstone united kingdom for precipitation experiments the acidified poultry litter extracts were bubbled with compressed air for 10 min and then 2 m naoh was added to attain solution ph in the 7 0 11 0 range samples were vortexed for 10 s and the precipitate was allowed to settle for 30 min the precipitates were washed three times with di water to remove soluble salts such as sodium chloride nacl and potassium chloride kcl and then freeze dried labconco freezone 4 5 kansas city mo at 10 3 mbar and 50 c phosphorus concentrations were analyzed in the supernatant to calculate precipitation efficiency eq 2 2 η prec ph j 1 p v ph j p v ph 4 5 in eq 2 η prec ph j is the fraction of p v in the poultry litter extract that precipitated at ph j p v ph j is the aqueous p v concentration at ph j p v ph 4 5 is the aqueous phase p v concentration at ph 4 5 which represents the nutrient rich extract the overall recovery efficiency η tot was calculated using eq 3 3 η tot η ext ph i η prec ph j for selective precipitation of struvite and potassium struvite the acidified extract from an 80 g l pl 3 slurry was dosed with stoichiometry based amounts of edta and or mgcl2 the calcium concentration in the acidified extract was 13 6 mm thus 13 6 mm edta was added to complex ca2 ions and prevent precipitation of calcium phosphates in separate experiments 13 6 mm edta and 13 6 mm mg2 were added to complex ca2 ions and compensate for the complexed ca2 respectively samples were vortexed for 10 s to ensure complete mixing then 2 m naoh was added to raise the solution ph to 7 0 11 0 the samples were vortexed for 10 s and the phosphorus laden precipitate settled for 30 min precipitates were rinsed three times with di water freeze dried and stored at 4 c until analysis 2 5 recycling the liquid process effluent to reduce water consumption the process effluent from the precipitation reaction was used to generate the subsequent poultry litter slurry as shown in fig 1 here a 100 g l slurry was processed using the extraction solid liquid separation and precipitation protocols described above filtered process effluent and fresh poultry litter were used to prepare the slurry for the next cycle after nutrient extraction separation and precipitation in the second cycle the process effluent was again recycled to generate the poultry litter slurry for the third cycle in this manner the input of freshwater was reduced and nutrients were retained within the system ultimately increasing the overall nutrient recovery 2 6 compositional analysis of recovered solids scanning electron microscopy sem fei nova nanosem 450 hillsboro oregon was employed to examine the morphology of recovered solids freeze dried samples were loaded onto conducting graphite tape fixed on aluminum supports no sample pretreatment was required because the precipitates were partially conducting microphotographs were taken at different magnification levels and the aspect ratio of recovered solids was calculated using 10 random crystals energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds oxford instruments nanoanalysis abingdon united kingdom was employed on at least three areas to investigate the atomic composition of distinct features in the samples in addition approximately 300 600 mg of recovered solids were added to 1 l of 10 mm hcl to confirm the inorganic composition and doc content these solutions were sonicated for 15 min to ensure complete dissolution of the recovered solids inorganic ions and doc were analyzed using the techniques identified above 3 results and discussion 3 1 ph dependent phosphorus extraction from poultry litter phosphorus extraction efficiencies were recorded for 40 g l slurries of pl 1 pl 2 and pl 3 as a function of ph fig 2 furthermore the acid demand per gram of poultry litter is reported in fig s1 of the supporting information si all three poultry litter slurries had an initial ph of approximately 6 7 6 9 and released 33 46 of the total extractable phosphorus upon addition of di water the aqueous p v concentration increased to 62 65 of the total extractable phosphorus after acidification to ph 5 0 further acid addition marginally increased the aqueous p v concentration for the ph 5 5 to 3 5 range to around 67 72 below ph 3 0 the aqueous p v concentration was greater than 80 of the total extractable phosphorus szögi et al 2008 reported similar p v extraction efficiencies for poultry litter with citric acid however weak organic acids increase the buffer capacity of the slurry and ultimately the amount of base needed for subsequent precipitation of the recovered nutrients for these reasons slurry ph was adjusted to 4 5 5 5 with hcl to optimize p v extraction efficiency and avoid the costs associated with excessive acid base addition previous work in soil and sediment systems has elucidated ph dependent p v adsorption desorption behavior furthermore calcium aluminum iron and organic matter play important roles in these reactions huang et al 2005 given the similarity of the p v extraction curves for pl 1 pl 2 and pl 3 in fig 2 to phosphoric acid dissociation chemistry chemical interactions were hypothesized for individual p v species with poultry litter solids this conceptual framework enabled modeling of the nonlinear relationship between p v extraction efficiency and ph assuming that the four aqueous p v species namely h3po4 h2po4 hpo4 2 and po4 3 independently interact with poultry litter solids the overall extraction efficiency was modeled using eq 4 4 η ext obs α 0 η ext 0 α 1 η ext 1 α 2 η ext 2 α 3 η ext 3 in eq 4 α is the ionization fraction stumm and morgan 2012 of individual p v species obs is the observed p v extraction efficiency and the 0 1 2 and 3 subscripts correspond to the h3po4 h2po4 hpo4 2 and po4 3 species respectively the α values were calculated using the slurry ph and acid dissociation constants for phosphoric acid i e pka1 2 15 pka2 7 20 and pka3 12 38 benjamin 2010 experimental data were fit to eq 4 using a least squares approach to calculate the η ext i terms because all experimental data was at ph 7 the η ext 3 term was not included since α3 was negligible i e α3 10 5 7 the η ext 0 η ext 1 and η ext 2 terms are reported as average 95 confidence interval in table s1 see si for the three poultry litter sources importantly η ext 1 controls the phosphorus extraction efficiency at the operational ph of the extraction reactor i e ph 4 5 5 5 the phosphorus extraction efficiencies for the three poultry litters demonstrated similar trends with solution ph specifically in the operational ph range of 4 5 5 5 this finding may derive from the reasonably consistent inorganic table 1 and organic mangalgiri et al 2017 composition of these poultry litter sources as shown in fig 2 the p v speciation based model fits the experimental data well note this model does not replace comprehensive compositional analysis and equilibrium modeling but rather serves as a quick validation of operating conditions to optimize p v extraction from poultry litter from diverse farms 3 2 recovery of nutrient laden fertilizers as indicated in table 1 poultry litter has an inherently favorable chemical composition that includes high p v nh4 mg2 ca2 and k contents with optimized stoichiometric and ph conditions these species can react to form a number of phosphorus laden minerals including struvite potassium struvite and calcium phosphates recovery of struvite minerals is preferred due to the slower nutrient release kinetics compared to traditional fertilizers talboys et al 2016 and the balanced nitrogen to phosphorus mgnh4po4 6h2o and potassium to phosphorus mgkpo4 6h2o ratios the slower release kinetics reduce both nutrient runoff and fertilizer demand the use of nutrient balanced struvite minerals in custom fertilizer formulas will also decrease consumption of energy intensive traditional fertilizers such as urea ammonium sulfate mono ammonium phosphate and potash nevertheless struvite products may still need to be mixed with traditional fertilizers to meet particular npk requirements recall from eq 2 that the precipitation efficiency was measured with respect to the p v concentration in the acidified poultry litter extract therefore the precipitation efficiency was 0 at ph 4 5 with no aeration or naoh addition the naoh dataset in fig 3 shows that the p v precipitation efficiency increased with increasing ph at ph 6 7 and 8 2 the p v precipitation efficiencies were 48 3 5 and 91 1 9 respectively above ph 9 0 more than 95 of the extracted p v was precipitated in the form of nutrient laden minerals szögi et al 2008 also reported high precipitation efficiencies for p v extracted from poultry litter although ca oh 2 was used as base an organic p containing flocculant was required and the final product was not in a preferred fertilizer form in separate experiments fig s2 in the si increased dosing of exogenous magnesium did not improve phosphorus precipitation efficiency although the composition of recovered products may vary under these conditions the solids recovered from precipitation experiments were analyzed by sem eds fig 4 presents microphotographs of solids generated using the process chemistry described in fig 1 namely extraction with co2 g and hcl followed by precipitation with air and naoh the solids shown in fig 4a and b are representative of products precipitated at ph 8 5 9 0 and 10 5 11 0 respectively for all three poultry litter sources under both ph conditions small needle like crystals and larger granular particles were observed eds analysis fig s3 in the si indicated that the larger irregular solids were calcium phosphates whereas the needle like particles were struvite and potassium struvite previous work has reported co recovery of calcium and magnesium based phosphates in wastewater although the presence of calcium and other cations affects struvite purity morphology crystallinity and particle size hao et al 2008 le corre et al 2005 matynia et al 2013 reported that other cations form hydroxide agglomerates on the surface of struvite crystals but these products were not observed in the sem microphotographs of recovered products from this study similarly co precipitation of amorphous calcium and magnesium oxyhydroxides has been reported for waste streams with comparable ca2 and mg2 concentrations crutchik and garrido 2011 pastor et al 2008 but those solids were not identified in the products recovered from poultry litter in this work compositional analyses of the mixed products were confirmed with ion chromatography and the results are presented in fig 5 the amount of nh4 present in the recovered solids decreased at ph 10 5 11 0 recall that the precipitation protocol involved aeration thereby increasing the favorability of nh3 off gassing at higher ph the nh3 g can be subsequently recovered using a sulfuric acid trap ndegwa et al 2009 but this operation was not included in the present study these conditions allowed a greater incorporation of k in the recovered products through precipitation of potassium struvite the npk molar ratios for the recovered precipitates were 2 0 1 0 0 1 and 0 9 1 0 0 2 in the 8 5 9 0 and 10 5 11 0 ph ranges respectively the precipitation ph and aeration time therefore control the relative nitrogen to phosphorus ratio of the recovered product offering clear advantages in customized generation of nutrient balanced fertilizers without expensive systems for phosphorus separation elution and precipitation blaney et al 2007 3 3 selective recovery of struvite and potassium struvite due to the lower agrochemical preference for calcium based phosphates suppression of the calcium content in the recovered product was investigated by adding edta to the poultry litter extract because edta preferentially complexes with calcium log kca edta 10 65 over magnesium log kmg edta 8 62 benjamin 2010 the addition of edta to the poultry litter slurry lowers the free ca2 concentration and decreases precipitation of calcium based solids in fact zhang et al 2010 used edta to inhibit precipitation of calcium phosphates in dairy effluent and sabbag et al 2014 used edta to preferentially precipitate struvite in wastewater with high calcium levels here a stoichiometric amount of edta 1 mol edta per mol ca was added to the poultry litter extracts to complex approximately 90 of the dissolved calcium with minimal changes to the dissolved magnesium chemistry e g 10 of dissolved magnesium as edta mg as shown in fig 3 the inclusion of edta in the poultry litter extracts resulted in p v recoveries that were 36 lower averaged across the ph 8 0 11 0 conditions due to inhibition of the calcium phosphate precipitation mechanism these data suggest that mg2 is slightly limiting in the edta modified poultry litter slurries the composition of recovered products was fairly homogeneous in the edta treatment scenario as evidenced in fig 4c d which highlights the absence of the large irregular solids associated with calcium phosphates increasing the precipitation ph from 8 5 9 0 to 10 5 11 0 produced crystals with a higher aspect ratio the aspect ratios of struvite crystals generated at ph 8 5 9 0 and 10 5 11 0 were calculated to be 2 9 0 62 and 5 5 1 7 respectively mathew and schroeder 1979 reported that substitution of nh4 with k produces minor structural changes and so the observed differences in aspect ratio may stem from the longer aeration or mixing conditions used at higher ph ion chromatography analyses fig 5 confirmed that more potassium was incorporated into the needle like structures that exhibited higher aspect ratios as the untreated poultry litter sources exhibited molar ratios of 0 9 1 1 mol mg mol p complexation of calcium may result in magnesium limited conditions therefore concurrent addition of edta and mgcl2 resulted in high recovery efficiencies that were similar to the baseline naoh scenario fig 3 for example the naoh edta mgcl2 treatment scheme resulted in 91 6 7 1 p v recovery at ph 8 9 which was comparable to the 96 3 1 7 recovery observed for naoh only importantly this operational scheme generated a much more homogeneous product as seen in fig 4e f and resulted in lower toc content in the recovered product see table s2 in the si these findings align with previous results stemming from edta use in dairy effluent zhang et al 2010 and municipal wastewater sabbag et al 2014 although the overall recovery changed no major differences in solids composition were observed for the naoh edta and naoh edta mgcl2 operating conditions see compositional data in fig 5 thus the combination of ph control and chemical addition was used to optimize not only recovery efficiency but also the npk ratio of the recovered products 3 4 effect of slurry strength on p v extraction and precipitation the effects of slurry strength on the phosphorus extraction and precipitation efficiencies were tested at 4 20 and 80 g l using pl 3 as expected buffer intensity increased with increasing slurry strength fig s4 in the si thereby affecting the acid demand during extraction the phosphorus extraction efficiency during the co2 bubbling operation was highest for the 4 g l loading and consistently decreased at higher solids content fig 6 importantly these data showcase the ability of co2 g to significantly offset the strong acid demand co2 bubbling achieved 88 2 5 2 80 3 2 8 and 63 7 7 5 phosphorus extraction for the 4 20 and 80 g l slurries respectively additional co2 dissolution and lower slurry ph may be achieved in pressurized reactors but the economics and operational complexity of such reactors are expected to limit translation to on farm solutions for high poultry litter solids loading i e greater than 100 g l mineral acid was required to achieve extraction efficiencies greater than 70 in those cases hcl was dosed until the ph was 4 5 5 5 the equivalents of acid required per gram of poultry litter remained consistent at 0 77 0 10 meq g for all slurry strengths overall the extraction efficiencies were in the 76 90 range indicating enhanced p v extraction with the combined co2 bubbling and strong acid addition scheme compared to strong acid alone fig 2 unsurprisingly the initial slurry strength impacted the concentrations of extracted species e g p v mg2 nh4 k etc in the precipitation reactor for all three slurry strengths the calculated saturation indices of hydroxyapatite struvite and potassium struvite suggested the potential for spontaneous precipitation at ph 8 5 9 0 the degree of super saturation was directly correlated to slurry strength therefore the 80 g l poultry litter slurry exhibited the most favorable potential for precipitation for the 4 g l and 20 g l poultry litter loadings 3 and 45 p v precipitation efficiencies were achieved at ph 8 8 in the 80 g l slurry over 94 of the p v was precipitated at ph 8 8 ronteltap et al 2010 reported that greater degrees of super saturation negatively affect crystal size for that reason a suite of precipitation studies were conducted using extracts from 50 100 and 200 g l poultry litter slurries of pl 3 no influence of poultry litter loading was observed with respect to the size of recovered struvite particles fig s5 in the si the lengths of the recovered crystals from the 50 100 and 200 g l poultry litter slurries were 107 9 21 7 106 5 19 5 and 98 7 30 7 μm respectively the aspect ratios were also consistent ranging from 4 4 1 0 to 5 1 1 7 based on these findings the optimal slurry strength was set to 100 200 g l although higher solids contents e g greater than 200 g l are expected to be chemically favorable these conditions may negatively affect pumping and mixing operations 3 5 sequencing batch phosphorus extraction and recovery slurry ph was the key operational parameter in the phosphorus extraction and recovery stages by maintaining optimal ph conditions providing adequate reaction times and incorporating a solid liquid separation step a combined system can be developed for extension to continuous flow or sequencing batch operation an offline kinetic study with three poultry litter loadings indicated that a 20 min extraction at ph 4 5 5 5 with continuous mixing was sufficient for phosphorus release fig s6 in the si a sequencing batch operation was conducted with 80 g l of pl 3 as documented in fig 7 the poultry litter slurry was mixed for 3 min and the ph equilibrated to 6 6 0 03 after 4 min of co2 bubbling the ph decreased to 6 0 0 1 and p v extraction was 68 5 5 2 the solution was then adjusted to ph 4 6 0 1 through addition of 0 65 meq of acid as hcl g poultry litter the acidified poultry litter slurry was mixed for 20 min to ensure optimal p v extraction the p v extraction efficiency was 78 0 6 7 after separating the solids 0 20 meq of base as naoh g poultry litter was dosed into the nutrient rich extract raising the ph to 6 6 0 03 then the solution was mixed for 2 min a 10 min aeration step did not significantly affect the ph but did provide nucleation sites for particle precipitation and growth mondal et al 2017 while a diffuser stone was employed here the aeration system can be optimized for on farm systems to enable production of finer bubbles that increase mass transfer involved with co2 stripping reactions and thereby increase the overall effectiveness of the aeration step following aeration 0 24 meq of base as naoh g poultry litter was added to raise the ph to 9 0 0 02 and the solution was gently mixed for 8 min the final precipitation efficiency was 91 0 3 7 overall 71 0 8 0 p v recovery was achieved and the dominant form of the recovered solids was struvite the complete run time for sequencing batch operation was 45 min demonstrating the quick and efficient process chemistry 3 6 recycling process effluent to reduce both water consumption and wastewater generation during phosphorus recovery from poultry litter a recycle scheme was incorporated into the process chemistry the liquid process effluent from one cycle was used to generate the poultry litter slurry in the next cycle table 2 reports the extraction and precipitation efficiencies overall p v recovery and effective water usage for a three cycle experiment at a solids loading of 100 g l of pl 3 the p v extraction and precipitation efficiencies were 67 73 and 97 99 respectively for all three cycles because nutrients that are not precipitated remain in the system the overall recovery increased from cycle 1 to cycle 3 the cumulative p v recovery was greater than 70 the effective water usage was calculated as the total water consumed over three cycles divided by the total mass of poultry litter processed at the end of three cycles the effective water consumption was approximately 4 4 l kg of poultry litter compared to 10 l kg for the no recycle scenario from cycle 1 to cycle 3 the strong acid hcl and base naoh demands increased from 0 8 to 1 4 meq g and 0 6 1 0 meq g respectively presumably due to incremental increases in doc concentration a ten stage recycle experiment demonstrated 90 overall p v recovery with an effective water consumption of only 2 3 l kg table s3 in the si 4 conclusions this work demonstrated a sustainable technology for rapid treatment and recovery of nutrients in poultry litter carbon dioxide bubbling enabled p v recoveries of 63 88 for poultry litter slurries with less than 100 g l strong acid was added to achieve p v extraction efficiencies greater than 70 for waste slurries with more than 100 g l the liquid process effluent was reused over a number of treatment cycles to ensure that the nutrient recovery process does not create a separate liability for farmers in the form of excessive wastewater volumes for a three stage recycle scenario fresh water usage was reduced by 56 the final nutrient enriched liquid effluent may also serve as a useful fertilizer product importantly the process was highly effective demonstrating over 70 phosphorus recovery and allowing selective production of struvite and potassium struvite through the introduction of calcium complexing agents and exogenous magnesium overall the successful extraction and recovery of phosphorus from poultry litter in the form of two valuable slow release fertilizer products represents a sustainable alternative to natural phosphate rock supplies that are being increasingly depleted

19410,phosphorus recovery from industrialized poultry operations is necessary to ensure sustainable waste management and resource consumption to realize these goals an innovative two stage process chemistry has been developed to extract nutrients from poultry litter and recover value added products over 75 phosphorus extraction was achieved by bubbling carbon dioxide into poultry litter

base addition over 95 of the extracted phosphorus was recovered as solid precipitate at ph 8 5 9 0 high purity struvite and potassium struvite products were selectively recovered through ph control introduction of a calcium complexing agent and addition of magnesium chloride the nitrogen to phosphorus to potassium npk ratio of the recovered solids was controlled through aeration and ph adjustment precipitation at ph 8 5 9 0 and 10 5 11 0 resulted in npk ratios of 2 0 1 0 0 1 and 0 9 1 0 0 2 respectively the process effluent was effectively recycled as makeup water for the subsequent batch of poultry litter thereby decreasing water consumption and increasing overall nutrient recovery sequencing batch operation yielded greater than 70 phosphorus recovery within a 45 min process

strategies such as piling composting and lagooning have been adopted by animal feeding operations afos to effectively treat organic carbon and nitrogen however the unfavorable redox chemistry of

eutrophication of inland water bodies le et al 2010 compounding this issue geospatially limited phosphorus reserves are being rapidly depleted due to the increasing food demand associated with the growing global population cooper et al 2011 together the environmental effects of phosphorus pollution and the economic vulnerability of phosphorus markets mandate a need for phosphorus recovery from agricultural waste in this context poultry operations are especially important due to the higher phosphorus content in poultry litter compared to other animal manures a typical nitrogen to phosphorus

farm fields were required to monitor soil phosphorus levels furthermore over 10 400 acres were banned from applying phosphorus containing fertilizers the initial economic impact model suggested that up to 228 000 tons of poultry litter would require active management salisbury university 2014 previous efforts to recover nutrients from poultry litter have mostly focused on mechanical thermochemical and biological treatment schemes mechanical processes have examined volume reduction through compaction and pelletization systems that increase the nutrient content per unit mass fasina et al 2006 however these systems have the inherent drawback of not modifying the npk ratio and therefore the pelletized product may still result in over application of phosphorus to agricultural

recovery tiquia and tam 2002 but these systems do not have any independent benefits for treatment or recovery of phosphorus a number of processes have been developed for and applied to recover phosphorus from wastewater treatment plants blaney et al 2007 nieminen 2010 while these technologies offer viable phosphorus recovery for municipal wastewater high strength animal manure poses challenges due to the differences in inorganic chemistry organic matter load and solids content these parameters affect the extraction of phosphorus from waste solids and the form of recovered products the inorganic composition of the waste stream especially the ca2 and mg2 content influence the chemical form of recovered phosphorus high ca2 content favors precipitation of hydroxyapatite

divalent cations needed for precipitation of nutrient laden solids yan et al 2015 as poultry litter has a lower water content than cow and swine manure wolf et al 2005 nutrient extraction from the relatively dry solids requires water consumption however large volumes of wastewater inhibit sustainable process implementation for these reasons new paradigms need to be explored with respect to nutrient recovery from high strength agricultural waste streams to date phosphorus recovery from afos has mostly focused on swine suzuki et al 2005 2007 and cattle mulbry et al 2008 wilkie and mulbry 2002 manure with only a few studies on poultry litter szögi et al 2008 yilmazel and demirer 2011 szögi et al 2008 reported 60 phosphorus recovery from poultry litter but the recovered hydroxyapatite is not an ideal agrochemical due to its low solubility wier et al 1971 yilmazel and demirer 2011 primarily focused on nitrogen recovery through addition of phosphorus and magnesium to anaerobically digested poultry litter to recover struvite and calcium phosphates however the need for an exogenous p v source may prevent widespread application in agricultural systems unlike hydroxyapatite struvite represents a slow release fertilizer with a balanced ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus under certain conditions potassium struvite mgkpo4 6h2o can also be recovered graeser et al 2008 struvite and potassium struvite can be mixed to produce nutrient laden solids with controllable npk ratios to address the shortcomings identified above the process chemistry shown in fig 1 was devised to facilitate the selective recovery of struvite and potassium struvite from poultry litter briefly poultry litter was added to water to generate a high strength slurry then phosphorus was extracted through addition of co2 g and strong acid the nutrient deficient solids were separated from the nutrient rich extract which was aerated and dosed with naoh to precipitate struvite based solids the objectives of this study were to 1 optimize the extraction of phosphorus from poultry litter as a function of ph and slurry strength 2 lower the acid base demands of the process chemistry through co2 gas bubbling aeration and 3 selectively recover struvite and potassium struvite from poultry litter to prevent production of large volumes of wastewater the process effluent was reused to generate subsequent poultry litter slurries and this recycle scheme was evaluated for impacts on nutrient extraction and precipitation efficiency the findings from this work enable sustainable recovery of nutrient balanced fertilizer products from agricultural waste streams while also preventing negative environmental outcomes associated with nutrient pollution 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals

litters have been anonymously labeled as pl 1 pl 2 and pl 3 before experimentation 1 kg batches of poultry litter were dried at 50 c for 3 days the dried litter was passed through stainless steel sieves with us mesh 16 1 18 mm to remove feathers woodchips bones and other debris slurries were generated by adding the dry sieved poultry litter to di water to investigate the impact of slurry strength on nutrient recovery poultry litter slurries were prepared at 4 20 and 80 g l for recycle experiments a 100 g l poultry litter slurry was employed all slurries were used within 2 h of generation total phosphorus was measured using the epa 3050b digestion method epa 1996 in accordance with previous reports szögi et al 2008 yilmazel and demirer 2011 acid hydrolysis was employed to measure the concentration of extractable phosphorus and other inorganic ions in particular the ph of a 40 g l slurry was adjusted to approximately 1 0 with 1 m hcl and the acid extractable phosphorus was measured using the stannous chloride method apha et al 2006 with a uv visible spectrophotometer thermo scientific evolution 600 waltham ma or microplate reader biotek eon winooski vt the difference in total phosphorus and acid extractable phosphorus was considered organic phosphorus inorganic phosphorus was approximately 85 of the total phosphorus in agreement with previous reports for poultry litter sharpley and moyer 2000 other inorganic ions such as ca2 mg2 k sodium na ammonium nh4 sulfate so4 2 and nitrate no3 were determined by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy perkin elmer 3100 aas waltham ma or ion chromatography dionex ics 2100 sunnyvale ca the ion chromatograph was run under isocratic conditions with 12 mm potassium carbonate anions or 32 mm methanesulfonic acid cations dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations in the poultry litter extracts were measured using a total organic carbon toc analyzer shimadzu toc l columbia md titration curves for poultry litter slurries were recorded with an autotitrator radiometer analytical tim 865 lyon france the inorganic content doc and alkalinity for 40 g l slurries of pl 1 pl 2 and pl 3 are reported in table 1 all compositional analyses were conducted in triplicate and data are reported as mean standard deviation 2 3 phosphorus extraction from poultry litter to investigate the impact of ph on phosphorus extraction 1 m hcl was added to 40 g l poultry litter slurries to generate solutions with ph values in the 1 0 7 0 range solution ph was measured using an orion ross ultra probe thermo scientific waltham ma poultry litter slurries were equilibrated under constant mixing for 30 min and then centrifuged at 5000 g for 10 min due to the high strength of these slurries the supernatant was diluted 100 1000 before p v analysis the extraction efficiency was calculated using eq 1 1 η ext ph i p v ph i p v ph 1 in eq 1 η ext ph i is the fraction of p v extracted into the water phase at ph i p v ph i is the p v concentration at ph i and p v ph 1 is the total acid extractable p v 2 4 struvite recovery from poultry litter extracts to generate nutrient rich extracts 80 g l poultry litter slurries were bubbled with co2 g for 5 min and 1 m hcl was added to reach ph 4 5 after 30 min of continuous mixing the slurry was centrifuged at 5000 g for 10 min to remove any remaining particles the supernatant was passed through 20 μm paper filters whatman maidstone united kingdom for precipitation experiments the acidified poultry litter extracts were bubbled with compressed air for 10 min and then 2 m naoh was added to attain solution ph in the 7 0 11 0 range samples were vortexed for 10 s and the precipitate was allowed to settle for 30 min the precipitates were washed three times with di water to remove soluble salts such as sodium chloride nacl and potassium chloride kcl and then freeze dried labconco freezone 4 5 kansas city mo at 10 3 mbar and 50 c phosphorus concentrations were

calculated using eq 3 3 η tot η ext ph i η prec ph j for selective precipitation of struvite and potassium struvite the acidified extract from an 80 g l pl 3 slurry was dosed with stoichiometry based amounts of edta and or mgcl2 the calcium concentration in the acidified extract was 13 6 mm thus 13 6 mm edta was added to complex ca2 ions and prevent precipitation of calcium phosphates in separate experiments 13 6 mm edta and 13 6 mm mg2 were added to complex ca2 ions and compensate for the complexed ca2 respectively samples were vortexed for 10 s to ensure complete mixing then 2 m naoh was added to raise the solution ph to 7 0 11 0 the samples were vortexed for 10 s and the phosphorus laden precipitate settled for 30 min precipitates were rinsed three times with di water freeze dried and stored at 4 c until analysis 2 5 recycling the liquid process effluent to reduce water consumption the process effluent from the precipitation reaction was used to generate the subsequent poultry litter slurry as shown in fig 1 here a 100 g l slurry was processed using the extraction solid liquid separation and precipitation protocols described above filtered process effluent and fresh poultry litter were used to prepare the slurry for the next cycle after nutrient extraction separation and precipitation in the second cycle the process effluent was again recycled to generate the poultry litter slurry for the third cycle in this manner the input of freshwater was reduced and nutrients were retained within the system ultimately increasing the overall nutrient recovery 2 6 compositional analysis of recovered solids scanning electron microscopy sem fei nova nanosem 450 hillsboro oregon was employed to examine the morphology of recovered solids freeze dried samples were loaded onto conducting graphite tape fixed on aluminum supports no sample pretreatment was required because the precipitates were partially conducting microphotographs were taken at different magnification levels and the aspect ratio of recovered solids was calculated using 10 random crystals energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds oxford instruments nanoanalysis abingdon united kingdom was employed on at least three areas to investigate the atomic composition of distinct features in the samples in addition approximately 300 600 mg of recovered solids were added to 1 l of 10 mm hcl to confirm the inorganic composition and doc content these solutions were sonicated for 15 min to ensure complete dissolution of the recovered solids inorganic ions and doc were analyzed using the techniques identified above 3 results and discussion 3 1 ph dependent phosphorus extraction from poultry litter phosphorus extraction efficiencies were recorded for 40 g l slurries of pl 1 pl 2 and pl 3 as a function of ph fig 2 furthermore the acid demand per gram of poultry litter is reported in fig s1 of the supporting information si all three poultry litter slurries had an initial ph of approximately 6 7 6 9 and released 33 46 of the total extractable phosphorus upon addition of di water the aqueous p v concentration increased to 62 65 of the total extractable phosphorus after acidification to ph 5 0 further acid addition marginally increased the aqueous p v concentration for the ph 5 5 to 3 5 range to around 67 72 below ph 3 0 the aqueous p v concentration was greater than 80 of the total extractable phosphorus szögi et al 2008 reported similar p v extraction efficiencies for poultry litter with citric acid however weak organic acids increase the buffer capacity of the slurry and ultimately the amount of base needed for subsequent precipitation of the recovered nutrients for these reasons slurry ph was adjusted to 4 5 5 5 with hcl to optimize p v extraction efficiency and avoid the costs associated with excessive acid base addition previous work in soil and sediment systems has elucidated ph dependent p v adsorption desorption behavior furthermore calcium aluminum iron and organic matter play important roles in these reactions huang et al 2005 given the similarity of the p v extraction curves for pl 1 pl 2 and pl 3 in fig 2 to phosphoric acid dissociation chemistry chemical interactions were hypothesized for individual p v species with poultry litter solids this conceptual framework enabled modeling of the nonlinear relationship between p v extraction efficiency and ph assuming that the four aqueous p v species namely h3po4 h2po4 hpo4 2 and po4 3 independently interact with poultry litter solids the overall extraction efficiency was modeled using eq 4 4 η ext obs α 0 η ext 0 α 1 η ext 1 α 2 η ext 2 α 3 η ext 3 in eq 4 α is the ionization fraction stumm and morgan 2012 of individual p v species obs is the observed p v extraction efficiency and the 0 1 2 and 3 subscripts correspond to the h3po4 h2po4 hpo4 2 and po4 3 species respectively the α values were calculated using the slurry ph and acid dissociation constants for phosphoric acid i e pka1 2 15 pka2 7 20 and pka3 12 38 benjamin 2010 experimental data were fit to eq 4 using a least squares approach to calculate the η ext i terms because all experimental data was at ph 7 the η ext 3 term was not included since α3 was negligible i e α3 10 5 7 the η ext 0 η ext 1 and η ext 2 terms are reported as average 95 confidence interval in table s1 see si for the three poultry litter sources importantly η ext 1 controls the phosphorus extraction efficiency at the operational ph of the extraction reactor i e ph 4 5 5 5 the phosphorus extraction efficiencies for the three poultry litters demonstrated similar trends with solution ph specifically in the operational ph range of 4 5 5 5 this finding may derive from the reasonably consistent inorganic table 1 and organic mangalgiri et al 2017 composition of these poultry litter sources as shown in fig 2 the p v speciation based model fits the experimental data well note this model does not replace comprehensive compositional analysis and equilibrium modeling but rather serves as a quick validation of operating conditions to optimize p v extraction from poultry litter from diverse farms 3 2 recovery of nutrient laden fertilizers as indicated in table 1 poultry litter has an inherently favorable chemical composition that includes high p v nh4 mg2 ca2 and k contents with optimized stoichiometric and ph conditions these species can react to form a number of phosphorus laden minerals including struvite potassium struvite and calcium phosphates recovery of struvite minerals is preferred due to the slower nutrient release kinetics compared to traditional fertilizers talboys et al 2016 and the balanced nitrogen to phosphorus mgnh4po4 6h2o and potassium to phosphorus mgkpo4 6h2o ratios the slower release kinetics reduce both nutrient runoff and fertilizer demand the use of nutrient balanced struvite minerals in custom fertilizer formulas will also decrease consumption of energy intensive traditional fertilizers such as urea ammonium sulfate mono ammonium phosphate and potash nevertheless struvite products may still need to be mixed with traditional fertilizers to meet particular npk requirements recall from eq 2 that the precipitation efficiency was measured with respect to the p v concentration in the acidified poultry litter extract therefore the precipitation efficiency was 0 at ph 4 5 with no aeration or naoh addition the naoh dataset in fig 3 shows that the p v precipitation efficiency increased with increasing ph at ph 6 7 and 8 2 the p v precipitation efficiencies were 48 3 5 and 91 1 9 respectively above ph 9 0 more than 95 of the extracted p v was precipitated in the form of nutrient laden minerals szögi et al 2008 also reported high precipitation efficiencies for p v extracted from poultry litter although ca oh 2 was used as base an organic p containing flocculant was required and the final product was not in a preferred fertilizer form in separate experiments fig s2 in the si increased dosing of exogenous magnesium did not improve phosphorus precipitation efficiency although the composition of recovered products may vary under these conditions the solids recovered from precipitation experiments were analyzed by sem eds fig 4 presents microphotographs of solids generated using the process chemistry described in fig 1 namely extraction with co2 g and hcl followed by precipitation with air and naoh the solids shown in fig 4a and b are representative of products precipitated at ph 8 5 9 0 and 10 5 11 0 respectively for all three poultry litter sources under both ph conditions small needle like crystals and larger granular particles were observed eds analysis fig s3 in the si indicated that the larger irregular solids were calcium phosphates whereas the needle like particles were struvite and potassium struvite previous work has reported co recovery of calcium and magnesium based phosphates in wastewater although the presence of calcium and other cations affects struvite purity morphology crystallinity and particle size hao et al 2008 le corre et al 2005 matynia et al 2013 reported that other cations form hydroxide agglomerates on the surface of struvite crystals but these products were not observed in the sem microphotographs of recovered products from this study similarly co precipitation of amorphous calcium and magnesium oxyhydroxides has been reported for waste streams with comparable ca2 and mg2 concentrations crutchik and garrido 2011 pastor et al 2008 but those solids were not identified in the products recovered from poultry litter in this work compositional analyses of the mixed products were confirmed with ion chromatography and the results are presented in fig 5 the amount of nh4 present in the recovered solids decreased at ph 10 5 11 0 recall that the precipitation protocol involved aeration thereby increasing the favorability of nh3 off gassing at higher ph the nh3 g can be subsequently recovered using a sulfuric acid trap ndegwa et al 2009 but this operation was not included in the present study these conditions allowed a greater incorporation of k in the recovered products through precipitation of potassium struvite the npk molar ratios for the recovered precipitates were 2 0 1 0 0 1 and 0 9 1 0 0 2 in the 8 5 9 0 and 10 5 11 0 ph ranges respectively the precipitation ph and aeration time therefore control the relative nitrogen to phosphorus ratio of the recovered product offering clear advantages in customized generation of nutrient balanced fertilizers without expensive systems for phosphorus separation elution and precipitation blaney et al 2007 3 3 selective recovery of struvite and potassium struvite due to the lower agrochemical preference for calcium based phosphates suppression of the calcium content in the recovered product was investigated by adding edta to the poultry litter extract because edta preferentially complexes with calcium log kca edta 10 65 over magnesium log kmg edta 8 62 benjamin 2010 the addition of edta to the poultry litter slurry lowers the free ca2 concentration and decreases precipitation of calcium based solids in fact zhang et al 2010 used edta to inhibit precipitation of calcium phosphates in dairy effluent and sabbag et al 2014 used edta to preferentially precipitate struvite in wastewater with high calcium levels here a stoichiometric amount of edta 1 mol edta per mol ca was added to the poultry litter extracts to complex approximately 90 of the dissolved calcium with minimal changes to the dissolved magnesium chemistry e g 10 of dissolved magnesium as edta mg as shown in fig 3 the inclusion of edta in the poultry litter extracts resulted in p v recoveries that were 36 lower averaged across the ph 8 0 11 0 conditions due to inhibition of the calcium phosphate precipitation mechanism these data suggest that mg2 is slightly limiting in the edta modified poultry litter slurries the composition of recovered products was fairly homogeneous in the edta treatment scenario as evidenced in fig 4c d which highlights the absence of the large irregular solids associated with calcium phosphates increasing the precipitation ph from 8 5 9 0 to 10 5 11 0 produced crystals with a higher aspect ratio the aspect ratios of struvite crystals generated at ph 8 5 9 0 and 10 5 11 0 were calculated to be 2 9 0 62 and 5 5 1 7 respectively mathew and schroeder 1979 reported that substitution of nh4 with k produces minor structural changes and so the observed differences in aspect ratio may stem from the longer aeration or mixing conditions used at higher ph ion chromatography analyses fig 5 confirmed that more potassium was incorporated into the needle like structures that exhibited higher aspect ratios as the untreated poultry litter sources exhibited molar ratios of 0 9 1 1 mol mg mol p complexation of calcium may result in magnesium limited conditions therefore concurrent addition of edta and mgcl2 resulted in high recovery efficiencies that were similar to the baseline naoh scenario fig 3 for example the naoh edta mgcl2 treatment scheme resulted in 91 6 7 1 p v recovery at ph 8 9 which was comparable to the 96 3 1 7 recovery observed for naoh only importantly this operational scheme generated a much more homogeneous product as seen in fig 4e f and resulted in lower toc content in the recovered product see table s2 in the si these findings align with previous results stemming from edta use in dairy effluent zhang et al 2010 and municipal wastewater sabbag et al 2014 although the overall recovery changed no major differences in solids composition were observed for the naoh edta and naoh edta mgcl2 operating conditions see compositional data in fig 5 thus the combination of ph control and chemical addition was used to optimize not only recovery efficiency but also the npk ratio of the recovered products 3 4 effect of slurry strength on p v extraction and precipitation the effects of slurry strength on the phosphorus extraction and precipitation efficiencies were tested at 4 20 and 80 g l using pl 3 as expected buffer intensity increased with increasing slurry strength fig s4 in the si thereby affecting the acid demand during extraction the phosphorus extraction efficiency during the co2 bubbling operation was highest for the 4 g l loading and consistently decreased at higher solids content fig 6 importantly these data showcase the ability of co2 g to significantly offset the strong acid demand co2 bubbling achieved 88 2 5 2 80 3 2 8 and 63 7 7 5 phosphorus extraction for the 4 20 and 80 g l slurries respectively additional co2 dissolution and lower slurry ph may be achieved in pressurized reactors but the economics and operational complexity of such reactors are expected to limit translation to on farm solutions for high poultry litter solids loading i e greater than 100 g l mineral acid was required to achieve extraction efficiencies greater than 70 in those cases hcl was dosed until the ph was 4 5 5 5 the equivalents of acid required per gram of poultry litter remained consistent at 0 77 0 10 meq g for all slurry strengths overall the extraction efficiencies were in the 76 90 range indicating enhanced p v extraction with the combined co2 bubbling and strong acid addition scheme compared to strong acid alone fig 2 unsurprisingly the initial slurry strength impacted the concentrations of extracted species e g p v mg2 nh4 k etc in the precipitation reactor for all three slurry strengths the calculated saturation indices of hydroxyapatite struvite and potassium struvite suggested the potential for spontaneous precipitation at ph 8 5 9 0 the degree of super saturation was directly correlated to slurry strength therefore the 80 g l poultry litter slurry exhibited the most favorable potential for precipitation for the 4 g l and 20 g l poultry litter loadings 3 and 45 p v precipitation efficiencies were achieved at ph 8 8 in the 80 g l slurry over 94 of the p v was precipitated at ph 8 8 ronteltap et al 2010 reported that greater degrees of super saturation negatively affect crystal size for that reason a suite of precipitation studies were conducted using extracts from 50 100 and 200 g l poultry litter slurries of pl 3 no influence of poultry litter loading was observed with respect to the size of recovered struvite particles fig s5 in the si the lengths of the recovered crystals from the 50 100 and 200 g l poultry litter slurries were 107 9 21 7 106 5 19 5 and 98 7 30 7 μm respectively the aspect ratios were also consistent ranging from 4 4 1 0 to 5 1 1 7 based on these findings the optimal slurry strength was set to 100 200 g l although higher solids contents e g greater than 200 g l are expected to be chemically favorable these conditions may negatively affect pumping and mixing operations 3 5 sequencing batch phosphorus extraction and recovery slurry ph was the key operational parameter in the phosphorus extraction and recovery stages by maintaining optimal ph conditions providing adequate reaction times and incorporating a solid liquid separation step a combined system can be developed for extension to continuous flow or sequencing batch operation an offline kinetic study with three poultry litter loadings indicated that a 20 min extraction at ph 4 5 5 5 with continuous mixing was sufficient for phosphorus release fig s6 in the si a sequencing batch operation was conducted with 80 g l of pl 3 as documented in fig 7 the poultry litter slurry was mixed for 3 min and the ph equilibrated to 6 6 0 03 after 4 min of co2 bubbling the ph decreased to 6 0 0 1 and p v extraction was 68 5 5 2 the solution was then adjusted to ph 4 6 0 1 through addition of 0 65 meq of acid as hcl g poultry litter the acidified poultry litter slurry was mixed for 20 min to ensure optimal p v extraction the p v extraction efficiency was 78 0 6 7 after separating the solids 0 20 meq of base as naoh g poultry litter was dosed into the nutrient rich extract raising the ph to 6 6 0 03 then the solution was mixed for 2 min a 10 min aeration step did not significantly affect the ph but did provide nucleation sites for particle precipitation and growth mondal et al 2017 while a diffuser stone was employed here the aeration system can be optimized for on farm systems to enable production of finer bubbles that increase mass transfer involved with co2 stripping reactions and thereby increase the overall effectiveness of the aeration step following aeration 0 24 meq of base as naoh g poultry litter was added to raise the ph to 9 0 0 02 and the solution was gently mixed for 8 min the final precipitation efficiency was 91 0 3 7 overall 71 0 8 0 p v recovery was achieved and the dominant form of the recovered solids was struvite the complete run time for sequencing batch operation was 45 min demonstrating the quick and efficient process chemistry 3 6 recycling process effluent to reduce both water consumption and wastewater generation during phosphorus recovery from poultry litter a recycle scheme was incorporated into the process chemistry the liquid process effluent from one cycle was used to generate the poultry litter slurry in the next cycle table 2 reports the extraction and precipitation efficiencies overall p v recovery and effective water usage for a three cycle experiment at a solids loading of 100 g l of pl 3 the p v extraction and precipitation efficiencies were 67 73 and 97 99 respectively for all three cycles because nutrients that are not precipitated remain in the system the overall recovery increased from cycle 1 to cycle 3 the cumulative p v recovery was greater than 70 the effective water usage was calculated as the total water consumed over three cycles divided by the total mass of poultry litter processed at the end of three cycles the effective water consumption was approximately 4 4 l kg of poultry litter compared to 10 l kg for the no recycle scenario from cycle 1 to cycle 3 the strong acid hcl and base naoh demands increased from 0 8 to 1 4 meq g and 0 6 1 0 meq g respectively presumably due to incremental increases in doc concentration a ten stage recycle experiment demonstrated 90 overall p v recovery with an effective water consumption of only 2 3 l kg table s3 in the si 4 conclusions this work demonstrated a sustainable technology for rapid treatment and recovery of nutrients in poultry litter carbon dioxide bubbling enabled p v recoveries of 63 88 for poultry litter slurries with less than 100 g l strong acid was added to achieve p v extraction efficiencies greater than 70 for waste slurries with more than 100 g l the liquid process effluent was reused over a number of treatment cycles to ensure that the nutrient recovery process does not create a separate liability for farmers in the form of excessive wastewater volumes for a three stage recycle scenario fresh water usage was reduced by 56 the final nutrient enriched liquid effluent may also serve as a useful fertilizer product importantly the process was highly effective demonstrating over 70 phosphorus recovery and allowing selective production of struvite and potassium struvite through the introduction of calcium complexing agents and exogenous magnesium overall the successful extraction and recovery of phosphorus from poultry litter in the form of two valuable slow release fertilizer products represents a sustainable alternative to natural phosphate rock supplies that are being increasingly depleted

19411,membrane technology has been widely employed for seawater desalination water and wastewater reclamation while membrane fouling still remains as a major challenge the polysaccharides in extracellular polymeric substances eps have been recognized as an important foulant that causes serious membrane fouling while the detailed structure of polysaccharides and the intermolecular interactions between them have not been adequately disclosed in this study two different polysaccharides and their mixtures were used to study the intermolecular cross linking of polysaccharides as well as its effects on membrane fouling results demonstrated that the fouling propensities of distinct polysaccharides were completely different which was attributed to the different intermolecular interactions lying in polysaccharides the cross linking among molecules of polysaccharide regardless of the homogeneity was found to form complex networks and determine the effective dimension of polysaccharides depending on the effective dimension of foulants pore blocking and cake layer occurred subsequently during filtration processes in light of this it potentially gives new insights into the fouling behaviours by combining the structure function knowledge of polysaccharides with their fouling propensity in addition transparent exopolymeric particles tep measurement was found to

polysaccharides intermolecular interaction membrane fouling transparent exopolymeric particles tep 1 introduction membrane technology has been extensively used for water and wastewater treatment especially when excellent efﬂuent quality is required however membrane fouling is still a major obstacle to the wide application of membrane technique although many efforts have been made to understand the fouling mechanism and develop strategies for fouling controls wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 feed water often contains a wide spectrum of foulants according to which membrane fouling can be classified into four basic categories i e scaling colloidal fouling organic fouling and biofouling baker 2004 goosen et al 2005 organic foulants including polysaccharides proteins and humic acids etc play a significant role in both organic fouling and biofouling extracellular polymeric substances eps are believed to cause serious membrane fouling problems cosenza et al 2013 di bella and torregrossa 2013 di bella et al 2011 as the main component of eps polysaccharides usually cause higher membrane rejections than other substances in eps such as proteins and humic substances meng et al 2017 the high fouling tendency of polysaccharides can be attributed to their large molecule size as well as the gelling properties which significantly enhance the filtration resistance and attract more bacteria to adhere to the membranes via either bridging membrane and bacteria or supplying the growth of bacteria bar zeev et al 2012 meng et al 2011 the gelling properties of polysaccharides are commonly caused by the intermolecular cross linking of polysaccharides chains meng and liu 2016 meng et al 2015 seviour et al 2012 however existing studies mainly focus on the presence and influence of polysaccharides gelation during membrane filtration while few attentions have been paid to the patterns of intermolecular interactions among polysaccharides in fact there are various types of polysaccharides in feed water and the molecule structures of polysaccharides are complicated even the cross linking patterns of homogeneous polysaccharide chains are different from one to another meng and liu 2013 therefore an in depth investigation is required to identify the rules of intermolecular cross linking of polysaccharides especially the interactions between heterogeneous polysaccharides a more intensive investigation on the intermolecular interactions of polysaccharides is needed in seeking to deepen the understanding of polysaccharides fouling and the relevant fouling mechanisms in order to interpret the membrane fouling caused by polysaccharides two typical polysaccharides i e alginate sodium and xanthan gum are employed as models in the present study alginate is widespread in feed water to membrane system and is a commonly used model polysaccharide in membrane fouling studies xanthan gum is another natural polysaccharide used as the model foulant to represent the eps mayer et al 2006 nataraj et al 2008 previous studies found that the rheological characteristic of xanthan gum solution was similar to that of activated sludge obtained from an membrane bio reactor mbr plant and both of them showed almost the same non newtonian behaviour mayer et al 2006 in this study the two selected polysaccharides were mixed at different ratios to scrutinize the effects of intermolecular interactions on the membrane fouling and the underlying mechanisms fouling models and micro observation of fouled membrane were employed to analyse the filtration and further to determine the dominant fouling mechanism under different feed solution environments transparent exopolymer particles tep measurement was incorporated in this study to bring a new viewpoint to analyse the intermolecular cross linking of polysaccharides tep are a class of transparent particulate polysaccharides alldredge et al 1993 which are gel like and ubiquitous in freshwater seawater and wastewater bar zeev et al 2015 in natural water most of tep form from precursors organic material released from phytoplankton or bacteria via a abiotic pathway meng et al 2013 operationally tep are defined as particles that can be stained by alcian blue in the past ten years tep have been studied on its role in membrane fouling since berman and holenberg first suggested tep as potential agents for membrane fouling berman and holenberg 2005 so far ample evidences have been accumulated on the significance of tep in biofilm development and membrane fouling bar zeev et al 2012 2015 berman et al 2011 meng and liu 2017 meng et al 2013 in this study tep measurement was applied to investigate the intermolecular interactions of polysaccharides as well as the role of tep in understanding membrane fouling 2 materials and methods 2 1 model polysaccharide suspensions in order to identify potential differences in the fouling propensities of different types of polysaccharides two compounds namely alginate sodium ags sigma usa and xanthan gum xg sigma usa were employed as model foulants for the filtration tests the molecular weights of alginate and xanthan gum are 12 80 kda and 500 kda respectively alginates are unbranched binary copolymers which consist of 1 4 linked β d mannopyranuronic acid m and 1 4 linked α l gulopyranuronic acid g residues in varying proportions draget et al 2005 as shown in fig 1 a two kinds of homopolymeric blocks mm block gg block and one kind of heteropolymeric block mg block arrange randomly in alginates draget et al 2005 smidsrød 1974 xanthan gum is a high molecule weight polysaccharide with a backbone chain consisting of 1 4 β d glucose units linked at the 1 and 4 positions which is identical to that of cellulose fig 1 b garcı a ochoa et al 2000 the backbone chain is substituted at c 3 on alternate glucose residues with a trisaccharide side chain containing a d glucuronic acid unit between two d mannose units linked at the o 3 position of every other glucose residue in the main chain nataraj et al 2008 there is an acetyl group at position o 6 of the d mannose unit linked to the backbone chain and approximately 31 56 of the terminal d mannose residues consist of a pyruvic acid residue which is linked to the 4 and 6 positions garcı a ochoa et al 2000 prud homme et al 1982 xanthan gum can be considered as an anionic polyelectrolyte due to the presence of acetic and pyruvic acids 2 2 tep measurement tep was measured with the use of alcian blue solution the alcian blue solution was freshly prepared by dissolving alcian blue 8 gx 0 02 sigma usa into 0 06 acetic acid and was then filtered with a 0 05 μm polycarbonate filter just before use to avoid the overestimation of tep due to the coagulation of the dye passow and alldredge 1995 villacorte et al 2009 to measure the quantity of tep formed from alginate xanthan gum and their mixtures sample solutions were filtered through 0 2 μm polycarbonate filters whatman united kingdom by applying a constant vacuum of 0 2 bars since tep are flexible and gel like substances a low pressure should be controlled to protect the tep from destruction when filtering samples then tep accumulated on the filters were subsequently stained by adding 1 ml of alcian blue solution after 5 s reaction excess dye was then removed by vacuum ﬁltration at a low pressure 0 2 bars and the filter was rinsed with 1 ml of milli q water washed filters with retained tep were then transferred into small beakers and immersed in 5 ml of 80 h2so4 solution for 2 h the beakers were shaked for 3 5 times over the 2 h to ensure the complete dissolve of alcian blue into the sulfuric acid finally the absorbance of sulfuric acid solution with eluted alcian blue was measured with a uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 2501pc japan at 787 nm wavelength using a 1 cm cuvette three replicates were performed for each sample which was measured for three times the average value of tep concentration was reported for further analysis calibration was conducted with xanthan gum and the tep concentration was ﬁnally expressed as mg xanthan gum equivalent per liter of water mg xeq l 1 it has to be noted that appropriate dilution is necessary to ensure the accuracy of measurement 2 3 filtration test unit as shown in fig 2 a standard dead end microfiltration module equipped with a 4 l feed vessel and a 50 ml stainless membrane cell was employed to examine the fouling potentials of polysaccharide solutions a flat sheet nylon membrane with pore size of 0 2 μm and effective surface area of 11 94 cm2 filtrex singapore was placed in the filtration cell the membrane was soaked in milli q water to provide sufﬁcient membrane swelling and to remove the manufacturing chemicals prior to each experiment the filtration module was operated at 1 bar and the filtrate was collected in a beaker placed on an electronic balance the weight change of filtrate was recorded continuously at the time interval of 10 s by a data logger connected to a computer for data collection before each experiment the ﬁltration system was cleaned thoroughly with milli q water for half an hour and the water remained in the system was discarded carefully feed solutions were prepared by mixing a deﬁned weight of polysaccharide according to speciﬁed concentration of each polysaccharide 2 4 analysis of fouling mechanism 2 4

ultrapure water through virgin membrane in this study respective fluxes at 100 min of filtration of polysaccharides samples were taken for calculation the internal resistance r f was calculated from ultrapure water ﬂux through membrane after fouled membranes were gently wiped with a sponge and rinsed with ultrapure water to remove the cake layer finally r p can be obtained by subtracting r m from r f using eq 3 2 4 2 modeling of filtration data modeling is a powerful tool to understand the fouling behaviors that are usually difficult to observe the complete blocking model standard blocking model intermediate blocking model and cake filtration model are attempted in this study to analyse the filtration data the possible mechanisms of membrane fouling by different polysaccharides can be determined by observing which model describes the filtration behaviour most properly according to the studies by bowen et al 1995 and hermia 1985 the aforementioned models can be expressed in a consolidated form as 4 d j d t k j a e f f j 2 n where j is the permeate flux l m2h at filtration time t h k is a constant dependent on the property of membrane a eff is the effective membrane surface area m2 and n is the blocking index when n takes the value of 2 1 5 1 and 0 respectively eq 1 can correspondingly transform into the complete blocking model standard blocking model intermediate

runger 2003 2 5 autopsy of fouled membrane the surface morphology of fouled membrane by alginate sodium xanthan gum and mixture of two polysaccharides 50 xanthan gum were observed by a feld emission scanning electron microscopy fesem jeol jsm 7600f japan the fouled membranes were completely dried in a freeze dryer christ germany after filtration for the purpose of comparison samples used for fesem observations were cut from the same location of fouled membranes all samples were observed at least three times and 8 10 images were randomly recorded each time 3 results 3 1 membrane fouling at various polysaccharides mixing ratios the effect of polysaccharides composition in feed water on membrane fouling was investigated by varying the xanthan gum content 0 25 50 60 75 and 100 wt of total feed polysaccharide while keeping the total feed polysaccharide concentration at 100 mg l fig 3 a showed the experimental ﬂux proﬁles as a function of filtration time during the constant transmembrane pressure tmp ﬁltration at the same operation condition the least flux decline over the 100 min filtration test was observed when the feed contained the alginate sodium alone compared to alginate xanthan gum fouled the membrane quickly from the early stage of filtration and led to much severer fouling during the filtration a surprising finding is that the most serious fouling occurred when alginate sodium was mixed with xanthan gum in feed water compared to the situation of alginate sodium alone or xanthan gum alone a steeper decline in the permeate ﬂux at the early stage and a lower equilibrium permeate flux at the end of filtration can be observed this indicated that the mixture of polysaccharides had a higher fouling propensity than any kind of single polysaccharide besides the flux profiles at different xanthan gum contents 0 50 and 100 wt with a total feed polysaccharide of 50 mg l were also examined as can be seen in fig 3 c the fouling propensities of polysaccharides showed the same tendency as that observed at the concentration of 100 mg l mixture xanthan gum alginate sodium fig 3 b presented the initial permeate flux decline rate against xanthan gum and alginate sodium contents in the feed water it is explicit that the ﬂux decline rate was closely related to the composition of polysaccharides and fouling rates of mixtures were higher than single polysaccharide as the xanthan gum content increased in the mixture of polysaccharide the initial ﬂux decline rate increased firstly until it reached 50 and then deceased this trend indicated the existence of an optimal mixing ratio between alginate sodium and xanthan gum that aggravated the fouling at the initial stage such a mixing ratio was observed to be around 50 based on the results in this study however more refined determination of the optimal ratio which inevitably requires more experiments is out of the scope of this study but will be a good topic for future investigation based on experimental data here we can draw an important conclusion that the permeate ﬂux decline has a heavy dependence on the composition of feed polysaccharides 3 2 fouling mechanism analysis 3 2 1 filtration resistances a series of resistances of the respective filtrations of alginate sodium xanthan gum and the mixture of them 50 xanthan gum were summarized in table 1 it can be seen that in the filtration of alginate sodium 0 xanthan gum the pore blocking resistance was higher than the resistance caused by cake layer while for the filtration of xanthan gum most of filtration resistance was caused by cake formation in the filtration of polysaccharide mixture 50 a much higher total resistance was observed and both pore blocking and cake formation were considerable in fact these results were consistent with the flux profiles presented in fig 3 which showed that mixture of polysaccharides caused the most severe fouling problem 3 2 2 modeling results of filtration data to analyse the possible fouling mechanism of feed containing different polysaccharides the ﬂux data of xanthan gum alginate sodium and the mixture of them 50 xanthan gum were modeled with eqs 5 8 respectively the modeling results were shown in fig 4 and the relative goodness f was calculated and flagged these models explain the fouling behaviour with different underlying mechanisms complete blocking model means each foulant such as the macromolecule or its aggregate clogs one pore and seals membrane pores standard blocking model assumes that foulant would go into the pores of membranes and was adsorbed onto the internal walls of pores resulting in the reduction of effective radius of membrane pore cake filtration model presumes that there was a cake layer formed on the membrane surface during filtration intermediate blocking model is suitable when both pore blocking and cake layer formation occur at the same time model with an f value of 1 0000 was the best fitting model for the experimental data and the parameters of the best fitting models for the filtration data were summarized in table 2 the results of statistical analyses showed that the standard blocking model explained the filtration of alginate sodium 0 xanthan gum best with a k s value of 5 74 m 1 implying that the pore blocking was the main fouling mechanism in this case in the scenario of pure alginate sodium molecules of alginate sodium penetrated into the membrane pores during filtration adhered onto the inner wall of pores and gradually led to a significant fouling instead the best benchmarking of cake filtration model as shown in the bottom plots of fig 4 suggested that the cake formation took the most of responsibility for the filtration of pure xanthan gum k c with a value of 113 23 m 1 indicated the considerable cake layer formation during microﬁltration liu and sun 2012 this result implied that molecules of xanthan gum accumulated on the membrane surface and formed a cake layer which acting as a pre filtration layer and thus reducing pore blocking during filtration campo et al 2017 in the filtration of the mixture of alginate sodium and xanthan gum the intermediate blocking model with a k a of 18 43 m 1 provided the highest modeling accuracy consequently both pore blocking and cake formation occurred during the filtration test and led to the most severe fouling phenomenon evidenced by the steepest flux decline rate at the early stage and the lowest equilibrium permeate flux by the end of experiment the model result was consistent with the resistance analysis which in turn support the conclusion that composition of polysaccharides in feed determined the fouling development during filtration 3 3 autopsy of fouled membrane section 3 2 provided an analysis in the view of flux decline while the morphological study of fouled membrane was further performed in this section to provide more supports to the conclusions on the fouling mechanisms the micro observation of fouled membrane surfaces resulted from the ﬁltrations of different polysaccharides compositions were shown in fig 5 the scanning electron microscope sem autopsy of fouled membranes can provide a detailed and intuitionistic observation of the membrane changes before and after the filtration thus facilitates deepening the understating of fouling mechanisms fig 5 a showed the clean membrane surface before filtration which can be used as a reference to evaluate the degree of fouling with different compounds for alginate sodium filtration the pore blocking was dominant indicating most of molecules were absorbed by the inner wall of membrane pores without cake layer formation therefore only small changes on the membrane surface occurred after the filtration as shown in fig 5 b different from alginate sodium xanthan gum appeared to accumulate on the membrane surface as observed from fig 5 d the cake layer covered most of the membrane surface during the filtration of mixture of alginate sodium and xanthan gum a certain amount of polysaccharides penetrated into membrane pores and meanwhile some of them deposited on membrane to form cake this was supported by fig 5 c where only several small scattered pin cakes developed on the membrane surface and reduced the effective membrane surface 3 4 tep formation from alginate sodium and xanthan gum in this study tep formed from alginate sodium xanthan gum and the mixture of them were measured to determine the cross linking between polysaccharide molecules as shown in fig 6 it was clear that the xanthan gum promoted the tep formation in the polysaccharides solutions the highest concentration of tep was observed in the xanthan gum solution while the lowest tep concentration was found in the alginate sodium solution it implied that xanthan gum molecules effectively interacted with each other and formed complexes i e tep conversely bare associations happened between the chains of alginate sodium leading to an extremely low concentration of tep more importantly in the mixture of alginate sodium and xanthan gum tep concentration was not directly in proportion to the xanthan gum quantity which implies the existence of interactions between the alginate sodium and xanthan gum for example fig 6 showed that the tep concentration reached 37 21 1 37 mg l when there was 25 xanthan gum in the solution with a total polysaccharides concentration of 100 mg l this tep concentration is clearly much higher than the linear superposition of tep formed from 25 mg l xanthan gum 25 mg l tep and 75 mg l alginate sodium 2 mg l tep these results indicated that in the solution of mixture of polysaccharides the intermolecular cross linking happened homogeneously and heterogeneously 4 discussion 4 1 intermolecular interactions between polysaccharides previous studies have shown that polysaccharides likely contribute to membrane fouling more than protein in feed rosenberger et al 2006 yigit et al 2008 however the underlying mechanisms behind the polysaccharides caused fouling have not been adequately studied in the current study the investigations on polysaccharide fouling have become more speciﬁc to focus on their molecule structures filtration tests were conducted with feed water containing different compositions of polysaccharides resulting with several critical concluding remarks it was found that xanthan gum and alginate sodium behaved significantly differently during filtration and mixture of them led to even more severe fouling problems the rationale for these distinct filtration behaviours could be attributed to their different molecular structures there are two types of monomers 1 4 linked β d mannopyranuronic acid m and 1 4 linked α l gulopyranuronic acid g in alginate chain alginates contain three types of blocks as shown in fig 1 a i e mg block mm block and gg block in mm blocks a weak intra molecular hydrogen bonding forms between the hydroxyl group at the three positions and the subsequent ring oxygen prompting the formation of a 3 fold left handed helix gg blocks usually are less flexible than mm blocks due to the diaxial links gg blocks tend to form stiffer 2 fold screw helical chains because of the intra molecular hydrogen bonding between the carboxyl group and the 2 oh group of the prior residues and the 3 oh group of the subsequent residues weaker on the contrary mg blocks containing both equatorial axial and axial equatorial links are comparatively disordered the hydrogen bonds in mg blocks form between the carboxyl group on the mannuronate and the 2 oh and 3 oh groups of the subsequent guluronate therefore mg blocks have greater flexibility than mm blocks due to the different degrees of freedom of the mannuronate and guluronate the overall physico chemical property of alginate chain depends on the content and distribution of mg mm and gg blocks in chain draget et al 2005 lee and mooney 2012 generally the alginate chain is flexible and the interaction between alginate chains is weak compared to the alginate xanthan gum is a high molecular weight extracellular polysaccharide 1 000 000 da garcı a ochoa et al 2000 the conformation of xanthan gum is ordered when it is dissolved at a low temperature 40 c and the stiff chain may exist as a single double or triple helix garcı a ochoa et al 2000 milas and rinaudo 1979 in general the natural state of xanthan gum molecules has been suggested to be bimolecular antiparallel double helices in addition it may form a very stiff intramolecular double stranded helical conformation by annealing of the less stiff elongated single stranded chain such ordered conformation of xanthan gum allows a better intermolecular cross linking which further forms a complex the complex formation can be explained by a series of sequential processes including the helix formation association of the helices and then forming junction zones this behaviour changes the conformation of xanthan gum molecule and increases effective molecular dimension and weight as discussed above molecule of alginate is small and flexible so that reduces the formation of complex structure while in the opposite way the big and stiff xanthan gum molecule facilities the formation of complex networks different from the aforementioned situations mixing alginate sodium with xanthan gum gave rise to a new mechanism characterized by the intermolecular cross linking of two types of polysaccharides which finally produced more tep as shown in fig 6 the xanthan gum would form intermolecular bonding such as hydrogen bonding with alginate by an interaction of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of them as shown in fig 7 more detailed hydroxyl groups on the primary chain and the side chain of xanthan gum could form intermolecular hydrogen bonding with carboxyl groups of alginate similar to the reaction between xanthan gum and other polysaccharide such as galactomannan chandrasekaran and radha 1997 besides the hydrogen bonding also developed between the carboxyl groups on the terminal side chain of xanthan gum and hydroxyl groups of alginate sodium pongjanyakul and puttipipatkhachorn 2007 as hydroxyl and carboxyl groups are commonly found in foulants the abovementioned interactions would occur frequently in feed water in addition to the bonding formation both xanthan gum and alginate sodium are long chain molecules where entanglements would occur and further improve tep formation the dimension of xanthan gum molecule is much bigger than that of alginate sodium thus the xanthan gum potentially acts as a magnet attracting nails alginate sodium 4 2 effects of intermolecular interaction on membrane fouling in this study feed water containing the same level of polysaccharides foulants were prepared in all filtration tests while completely different permeate flux declines were observed indicating that these polysaccharides had distinct fouling propensities further analysis by fouling mechanism models combined with autopsy of fouled membranes and resistance analysis showed that alginate sodium fouled membrane mainly by pore blocking cake layer formation in xanthan gum was dominant while mixture of them led to pore blocking and cake formation simultaneously these observations were actually in consistent with the results of tep determination in this study the membrane used has a pore size of 0 2 μm and tep should be retained and accumulated on the membrane surface to form the cake layer there were very few tep found in the solution of alginate which indicated that alginate molecules went into membrane pores and then were absorbed onto inner walls further leading to a substantial pore blocking the xanthan gum formed complex networks i e tep which mainly developed cake layer on the membrane surface during filtration mixing alginate with xanthan gum improved the tep formation and thus increased the cake layer formation with unreacted molecules of alginate blocking membrane pores the tep formation could be attributed to the differences lying in the intermolecular interactions of polysaccharides as discussed in section 4 1 schematic representations for the intermolecular interactions of polysaccharides and their effects on membrane fouling were shown in fig 8 limited efforts have been made in the literature to study the interactions between polysaccharide molecules which makes the feed water seem like a black box results in this study showed that the intermolecular cross linking played a key role in the aggregation of foulants which further determines the filtration behaviours future researches should thereby focus on the foulant foulant interactions to find out the interaction mechanisms behind them which would provide a meaningful guidance in the fouling control apart from this the interaction between polysaccharide and protein protein and humic acid for example also needs to be clarified with these knowledge the morphology of foulants in feed would be clearer to allow deepening the understanding of foulants and fouling mechanism however it is difficult to determine the complex networks formed by polysaccharides interactions as they are deformable and fragile with nano micro and macro scales in this study tep measurement was applied and it turned out that the tep based analysis was in good agreement with the intermolecular interactions theory behind these polysaccharides this study further demonstrated that tep determination could provide an intuitionistic evaluation of the complex networks formed from polysaccharides and thus would potentially act as a good indicator of fouling propensity interactions between polysaccharides had been studied in the field of carbohydrate polymers where the reactions and characteristics of polysaccharides were discussed with high concentrations some rules could still be meaningful in the study of foulant interactions to better understand their fouling propensities more detailed understanding of the foulants in feed water is required to provide a new insight into the membrane fouling problems and to illuminate the black box 5 conclusions the current study investigated the intermolecular interactions of polysaccharides in membrane fouling during microfiltration results from resistance analysis filtration data modeling and sem observation of fouled membrane demonstrated that the pore blocking may dominate in the filtration of alginate sodium while the cake layer formation took the main responsibility for the xanthan gum fouling the mixture of two polysaccharides clogged membrane pores and also developed cake layer on membrane resulting with the most severe fouling phenomenon these results could be explained by combining the structure function of polysaccharides with their fouling propensity intermolecular interaction of polysaccharides determined the size of polysaccharides aggregations which further significantly influence the fouling development during filtration these results were consistent with the tep measurements consequently the filtration behaviours of polysaccharides foulants were closely related to their intermolecular interactions it is of great significance to combine the structure function knowledge of polysaccharides with their fouling propensity tep measurement which provided an intuitionistic evaluation of the complex networks formed from interactions of polysaccharides could act as a good indicator for fouling potential in studying membrane fouling

19411,membrane technology has been widely employed for seawater desalination water and wastewater reclamation while membrane fouling still remains as a major challenge the polysaccharides in extracellular polymeric substances eps have been recognized as an important foulant that causes serious membrane fouling while the detailed structure of polysaccharides and the intermolecular interactions between them have not been adequately disclosed in this study two different polysaccharides and their mixtures were used to study the intermolecular cross linking of polysaccharides as well as its effects on membrane fouling results demonstrated that the fouling propensities of distinct polysaccharides were completely different which was attributed to the different intermolecular interactions lying in polysaccharides the cross linking among molecules of polysaccharide regardless of the homogeneity was found to form complex networks and determine the effective dimension of polysaccharides depending on the effective dimension of foulants pore blocking and cake layer occurred subsequently during filtration processes in light of this it potentially gives new insights into

more bacteria to adhere to the membranes via either bridging membrane and bacteria or supplying the growth of bacteria bar zeev et al 2012 meng et al 2011 the gelling properties of polysaccharides are commonly caused by the intermolecular cross linking of polysaccharides chains meng and liu 2016 meng et al 2015 seviour et al 2012 however existing studies mainly focus on the presence and influence of polysaccharides gelation during membrane filtration while few attentions have been paid to the patterns of intermolecular interactions among polysaccharides in fact there are various types of polysaccharides in feed water and the molecule structures of polysaccharides are complicated even the cross linking patterns of homogeneous polysaccharide chains are different from one to another meng

2005 as shown in fig 1 a two kinds of homopolymeric blocks mm block gg block and one kind of heteropolymeric block mg block arrange randomly in alginates draget et al 2005 smidsrød 1974 xanthan gum is a high molecule weight polysaccharide with a backbone chain consisting of 1 4 β d glucose units linked at the 1 and 4 positions which is identical to that of cellulose fig 1 b garcı a ochoa et al 2000 the backbone chain is substituted at c 3 on alternate glucose residues with a trisaccharide side chain containing a d glucuronic acid unit between two d mannose units linked at the o 3 position of every other glucose residue in the main chain nataraj et al 2008 there is an acetyl group at position o 6 of the d mannose unit linked to the backbone chain and approximately 31 56 of the terminal d mannose residues consist of a pyruvic acid residue which is linked to the 4 and 6 positions garcı a ochoa et al 2000 prud homme et al 1982 xanthan gum can be considered as an anionic polyelectrolyte due to the presence of acetic and pyruvic acids 2 2 tep measurement tep was measured with the use of alcian blue solution the alcian blue solution was freshly prepared by dissolving alcian blue 8 gx 0 02 sigma usa into 0 06 acetic acid and was then filtered with a 0 05 μm polycarbonate filter just before use to avoid the overestimation of tep due to the coagulation of the dye passow and alldredge 1995 villacorte et al 2009 to measure the quantity of tep formed from alginate xanthan gum and their mixtures sample solutions were filtered through 0 2 μm polycarbonate filters whatman united kingdom by applying a constant vacuum of 0 2 bars since tep are flexible and gel like substances a low pressure should be controlled to protect the tep from destruction when filtering samples then tep accumulated on the filters were subsequently stained by adding 1 ml of alcian blue solution after 5 s reaction excess dye was then removed by vacuum ﬁltration at a low pressure 0 2 bars and the filter was rinsed with 1 ml of milli q water washed filters with retained tep were then transferred into small beakers and immersed in 5 ml of 80 h2so4 solution for 2 h the beakers were shaked for 3 5 times over the 2 h to ensure the complete dissolve of alcian blue into the sulfuric acid finally the absorbance of sulfuric acid solution with eluted alcian blue was measured with a uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 2501pc japan at 787 nm wavelength using a 1 cm cuvette three replicates were performed for each sample which was measured for three times the average value of tep concentration was reported for further analysis calibration was conducted with xanthan gum and the tep concentration was ﬁnally expressed as mg xanthan gum equivalent per liter of water mg xeq l 1 it has to be noted that appropriate dilution is necessary to ensure the accuracy of measurement 2 3 filtration test unit as shown in fig 2 a standard dead end microfiltration module equipped with a 4 l feed vessel and a 50 ml stainless membrane cell was employed to examine the fouling potentials of polysaccharide solutions a flat sheet nylon membrane with pore size of 0 2 μm and effective surface area of 11 94 cm2 filtrex singapore was placed in the filtration cell the membrane was soaked in milli q water to provide sufﬁcient membrane swelling and to remove the manufacturing chemicals prior to each experiment the filtration module was operated at 1 bar and the filtrate was collected in a beaker placed on an electronic balance the weight change of filtrate was recorded continuously at the time interval of 10 s by a data logger connected to a computer for data collection before each experiment the ﬁltration system was cleaned thoroughly with milli q water for half an hour and the water remained in the system was discarded carefully feed solutions were prepared by mixing a deﬁned weight of polysaccharide according to speciﬁed concentration of each polysaccharide 2 4 analysis of fouling mechanism 2 4

membrane resistance r m pore blocking resistance r p and cake layer resistance r c 1 j δ p μ r t 2 r t r m r p r c 3 r f r m r p where j is the permeate ﬂux m3m 2s 1 δp is the applied pressure during filtration pa and μ is the solution viscosity pa s r t is the total resistance after filtration which can be estimated from filtration flux at steady state m 1 r m is calculated from eq 1 by filtering ultrapure water through virgin membrane in this study respective fluxes at 100 min of filtration of polysaccharides samples were taken for calculation the internal resistance r f was calculated from ultrapure water ﬂux through membrane after fouled membranes were gently wiped with a sponge and rinsed with ultrapure water to remove the cake layer finally r p can be obtained by subtracting r m from r f using eq 3 2 4 2 modeling of filtration data modeling is a powerful tool to understand the fouling behaviors that are usually difficult to observe the complete blocking model standard blocking model intermediate blocking model and cake filtration model are attempted in this study to analyse the filtration data the possible mechanisms of membrane fouling by different polysaccharides can be determined by observing which model describes the filtration behaviour most properly according to the studies by bowen et al 1995 and hermia 1985 the aforementioned models can be expressed in a consolidated form as 4 d j d t k j a e f f j 2 n where j is the permeate flux l m2h at filtration time t h k is a constant dependent on the property of membrane a eff is the effective membrane surface area m2 and n is the blocking index when n takes the value of 2 1 5 1 and 0 respectively eq 1 can correspondingly transform into the complete blocking model standard blocking model intermediate blocking model and cake filtration model which are expressed by eqs 2 5 liu and sun 2012 nataraj et al 2008 5 j j 0 e k t e k a j 0 t 6 j j 0 1 2 k s a e f f 2 j 0 0 5 t 2 7 j j 0 1 k a e f f j 0 t 1

evaluated by the relative goodness f which is deﬁned as follows liu and wang 2008 9 f σ 2 min σ 2 where σ 2 is the prediction error square and σ 2 min is the minimum value among all σ 2 determined by

runger 2003 2 5 autopsy of fouled membrane the surface morphology of fouled membrane by alginate sodium xanthan gum and mixture of two polysaccharides 50 xanthan gum were observed by a feld emission scanning electron microscopy fesem jeol jsm 7600f japan the fouled membranes were completely dried in a freeze dryer christ germany after filtration for the purpose of comparison samples used for fesem observations were cut from the same location of fouled membranes all samples were observed at least three times and 8 10 images were randomly recorded each time 3 results 3 1 membrane fouling at various polysaccharides mixing ratios the effect of polysaccharides composition in feed water on membrane fouling was investigated by varying the xanthan gum content 0 25 50 60 75 and 100 wt of total feed polysaccharide while keeping the total feed polysaccharide concentration at 100 mg l fig 3 a showed the experimental ﬂux proﬁles as a function of filtration time during the constant transmembrane pressure tmp ﬁltration at the same operation condition the least flux decline over the 100 min filtration test was observed when the feed contained the alginate sodium alone compared to alginate xanthan gum fouled the membrane quickly from the early stage of filtration and led to much severer fouling during the filtration a surprising finding is that the most serious fouling occurred when alginate sodium was mixed with xanthan gum in feed water compared to the situation of alginate sodium alone or xanthan gum alone a steeper decline in the permeate ﬂux at the early stage and a lower equilibrium permeate flux at the end of filtration can be observed this indicated that the mixture of polysaccharides had a higher fouling propensity than any kind of single polysaccharide besides the flux profiles at different xanthan gum contents 0 50 and 100 wt with a total feed polysaccharide of 50 mg l were also examined as can be seen in fig 3 c the fouling propensities of polysaccharides showed the same tendency as that observed at the concentration of 100 mg l mixture xanthan gum alginate sodium fig 3 b presented the initial permeate flux decline rate against xanthan gum and alginate sodium contents in the feed water it is explicit that the ﬂux decline rate was closely related to the composition of polysaccharides and fouling rates of mixtures were higher than single polysaccharide as the xanthan gum content increased in the mixture of polysaccharide the initial ﬂux decline rate increased firstly until it reached 50 and then deceased this trend indicated the existence of an optimal mixing ratio between alginate sodium and xanthan gum that aggravated the fouling at the initial stage such a mixing ratio was observed to be around 50 based on the results in this study however more refined determination of the optimal ratio which inevitably requires more experiments is out of the scope of this study but will be a good topic for future investigation based on experimental data here we can draw an important conclusion that the permeate ﬂux decline has a heavy dependence on the composition of feed polysaccharides 3 2 fouling mechanism analysis 3 2 1 filtration resistances a series of resistances of the respective filtrations of alginate sodium xanthan gum and the mixture of them 50 xanthan gum were summarized in table 1 it can be seen that in the filtration of alginate sodium 0 xanthan gum the pore blocking resistance was higher than the resistance caused by cake layer while for the filtration of xanthan gum most of filtration resistance was caused by cake formation in the filtration of polysaccharide mixture 50 a much higher total resistance was observed and both pore blocking and cake formation were considerable in fact these results were consistent with the flux profiles presented in fig 3 which showed that mixture of polysaccharides caused the most severe fouling problem 3 2 2 modeling results of filtration data to analyse the possible fouling mechanism of feed containing different polysaccharides the ﬂux data of xanthan gum alginate sodium and the mixture of them 50 xanthan gum were modeled with eqs 5 8 respectively the modeling results were shown in fig 4 and the relative goodness f was calculated and flagged these models explain the fouling behaviour with different underlying mechanisms complete blocking model means each foulant such as the macromolecule or its aggregate clogs one pore and seals membrane pores standard blocking model assumes that foulant would go into the pores of membranes and was adsorbed onto the internal walls of pores resulting in the reduction of effective radius of membrane pore cake filtration model presumes that there was a cake layer formed on the membrane surface during filtration intermediate blocking model is suitable when both pore blocking and cake layer formation occur at the same time model with an f value of 1 0000 was the best fitting model for the experimental data and the parameters of the best fitting models for the filtration data were summarized in table 2 the results of statistical analyses showed that the standard blocking model explained the filtration of alginate sodium 0 xanthan gum best with a k s value of 5 74 m 1 implying that the pore blocking was the main fouling mechanism in this case in the scenario of pure alginate sodium molecules of alginate sodium penetrated into the membrane pores during filtration adhered onto the inner wall of pores and gradually led to a significant fouling instead the best benchmarking of cake filtration model as shown in the bottom plots of fig 4 suggested that the cake formation took the most of responsibility for the filtration of pure xanthan gum k c with a value of 113 23 m 1 indicated the considerable cake layer formation during microﬁltration liu and sun 2012 this result implied that molecules of xanthan gum accumulated on the membrane surface and formed a cake layer which acting as a pre filtration layer and thus reducing pore blocking during filtration campo et al 2017 in the filtration of the mixture of alginate sodium and xanthan gum the intermediate blocking model with a k a of 18 43 m 1 provided the highest modeling accuracy consequently both pore blocking and cake formation occurred during the filtration test and led to the most severe fouling phenomenon evidenced by the steepest flux decline rate at the early stage and the lowest equilibrium permeate flux by the end of experiment the model result was consistent with the resistance analysis which in turn support the conclusion that composition of polysaccharides in feed determined the fouling development during filtration 3 3 autopsy of fouled membrane section 3 2 provided an analysis in the view of flux decline while the morphological study of fouled membrane was further performed in this section to provide more supports to the conclusions on the fouling mechanisms the micro observation of fouled membrane surfaces resulted from the ﬁltrations of different polysaccharides compositions were shown in fig 5 the scanning electron microscope sem autopsy of fouled membranes can provide a detailed and intuitionistic observation of the membrane changes before and after the filtration thus facilitates deepening the understating of fouling mechanisms fig 5 a showed the clean membrane surface before filtration which can be used as a reference to evaluate the degree of fouling with different compounds for alginate sodium filtration the pore blocking was dominant indicating most of molecules were absorbed by the inner wall of membrane pores without cake layer formation therefore only small changes on the membrane surface occurred after the filtration as shown in fig 5 b different from alginate sodium xanthan gum appeared to accumulate on the membrane surface as observed from fig 5 d the cake layer covered most of the membrane surface during the filtration of mixture of alginate sodium and xanthan gum a certain amount of polysaccharides penetrated into membrane pores and meanwhile some of them deposited on membrane to form cake this was supported by fig 5 c where only several small scattered pin cakes developed on the membrane surface and reduced the effective membrane surface 3 4 tep formation from alginate sodium and xanthan gum in this study tep formed from alginate sodium xanthan gum and the mixture of them were measured to determine the cross linking between polysaccharide molecules as shown in fig 6 it was clear that the xanthan gum promoted the tep formation in the polysaccharides solutions the highest concentration of tep was observed in the xanthan gum solution while the lowest tep concentration was found in the alginate sodium solution it implied that xanthan gum molecules effectively interacted with each other and formed complexes i e tep conversely bare associations happened between the chains of alginate sodium leading to an extremely low concentration of tep more importantly in the mixture of alginate sodium and xanthan gum tep concentration was not directly in proportion to the xanthan gum quantity which implies the existence of interactions between the alginate sodium and xanthan gum for example fig 6 showed that the tep concentration reached 37 21 1 37 mg l when there was 25 xanthan gum in the solution with a total polysaccharides concentration of 100 mg l this tep concentration is clearly much higher than the linear superposition of tep formed from 25 mg l xanthan gum 25 mg l tep and 75 mg l alginate sodium 2 mg l tep these results indicated that in the solution of mixture of polysaccharides the intermolecular cross linking happened homogeneously and heterogeneously 4 discussion 4 1 intermolecular interactions between polysaccharides previous studies have shown that polysaccharides likely contribute to membrane fouling more than protein in feed rosenberger et al 2006 yigit et al 2008 however the underlying mechanisms behind the polysaccharides caused fouling have not been adequately studied in the current study the investigations on polysaccharide fouling have become more speciﬁc to focus on their molecule structures filtration tests were conducted with feed water containing different compositions of polysaccharides resulting with several critical concluding remarks it was found that xanthan gum and alginate sodium behaved significantly differently during filtration and mixture of them led to even more severe fouling problems the rationale for these distinct filtration behaviours could be attributed to their different molecular structures there are two types of monomers 1 4 linked β d mannopyranuronic acid m and 1 4 linked α l gulopyranuronic acid g in alginate chain alginates contain three types of blocks as shown in fig 1 a i e mg block mm block and gg block in mm blocks a weak intra molecular hydrogen bonding forms between the hydroxyl group at the three positions and the subsequent ring oxygen prompting the formation of a 3 fold left handed helix gg blocks usually are less flexible than mm blocks due to the diaxial links gg blocks tend to form stiffer 2 fold screw helical chains because of the intra molecular hydrogen bonding between the carboxyl group and the 2 oh group of the prior residues and the 3 oh group of the subsequent residues weaker on the contrary mg blocks containing both equatorial axial and axial equatorial links are comparatively disordered the hydrogen bonds in mg blocks form between the carboxyl group on the mannuronate and the 2 oh and 3 oh groups of the subsequent guluronate therefore mg blocks have greater flexibility than mm blocks due to the different degrees of freedom of the mannuronate and guluronate the overall physico chemical property of alginate chain depends on the content and distribution of mg mm and gg blocks in chain draget et al 2005 lee and mooney 2012 generally the alginate chain is flexible and the interaction between alginate chains is weak compared to the alginate xanthan gum is a high molecular weight extracellular polysaccharide 1 000 000 da garcı a ochoa et al 2000 the conformation of xanthan gum is ordered when it is dissolved at a low temperature 40 c and the stiff chain may exist as a single double or triple helix garcı a ochoa et al 2000 milas and rinaudo 1979 in general the natural state of xanthan gum molecules has been suggested to be bimolecular antiparallel double helices in addition it may form a very stiff intramolecular double stranded helical conformation by annealing of the less stiff elongated single stranded chain such ordered conformation of xanthan gum allows a better intermolecular cross linking which further forms a complex the complex formation can be explained by a series of sequential processes including the helix formation association of the helices and then forming junction zones this behaviour changes the conformation of xanthan gum molecule and increases effective molecular dimension and weight as discussed above molecule of alginate is small and flexible so that reduces the formation of complex structure while in the opposite way the big and stiff xanthan gum molecule facilities the formation of complex networks different from the aforementioned situations mixing alginate sodium with xanthan gum gave rise to a new mechanism characterized by the intermolecular cross linking of two types of polysaccharides which finally produced more tep as shown in fig 6 the xanthan gum would form intermolecular bonding such as hydrogen bonding with alginate by an interaction of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of them as shown in fig 7 more detailed hydroxyl groups on the primary chain and the side chain of xanthan gum could form intermolecular hydrogen bonding with carboxyl groups of alginate similar to the reaction between xanthan gum and other polysaccharide such as galactomannan chandrasekaran and radha 1997 besides the hydrogen bonding also developed between the carboxyl groups on the terminal side chain of xanthan gum and hydroxyl groups of alginate sodium pongjanyakul and puttipipatkhachorn 2007 as hydroxyl and carboxyl groups are commonly found in foulants the abovementioned interactions would occur frequently in feed water in addition to the bonding formation both xanthan gum and alginate sodium are long chain molecules where entanglements would occur and further improve tep formation the dimension of xanthan gum molecule is much bigger than that of alginate sodium thus the xanthan gum potentially acts as a magnet attracting nails alginate sodium 4 2 effects of intermolecular interaction on membrane fouling in this study feed water containing the same level of polysaccharides foulants were prepared in all filtration tests while completely different permeate flux declines were observed indicating that these polysaccharides had distinct fouling propensities further analysis by fouling mechanism models combined with autopsy of fouled membranes and resistance analysis showed that alginate sodium fouled membrane mainly by pore blocking cake layer formation in xanthan gum was dominant while mixture of them led to pore blocking and cake formation simultaneously these observations were actually in consistent with the results of tep determination in this study the membrane used has a pore size of 0 2 μm and tep should be retained and accumulated on the membrane surface to form the cake layer there were very few tep found in the solution of alginate which indicated that alginate molecules went into membrane pores and then were absorbed onto inner walls further leading to a substantial pore blocking the xanthan gum formed complex networks i e tep which mainly developed cake layer on the membrane surface during filtration mixing alginate with xanthan gum improved the tep formation and thus increased the cake layer formation with unreacted molecules of alginate blocking membrane pores the tep formation could be attributed to the differences lying in the intermolecular interactions of polysaccharides as discussed in section 4 1 schematic representations for the intermolecular interactions of polysaccharides and their effects on membrane fouling were shown in fig 8 limited efforts have been made in the literature to study the interactions between polysaccharide molecules which makes the feed water seem like a black box results in this study showed that the intermolecular cross linking played a key role in the aggregation of foulants which further determines the filtration behaviours future researches should thereby focus on the foulant foulant interactions to find out the interaction mechanisms behind them which would provide a meaningful guidance in the fouling control apart from this the interaction between polysaccharide and protein protein and humic acid for example also needs to be clarified with these knowledge the morphology of foulants in feed would be clearer to allow deepening the understanding of foulants and fouling mechanism however it is difficult to determine the complex networks formed by polysaccharides interactions as they are deformable and fragile with nano micro and macro scales in this study tep measurement was applied and it turned out that the tep based analysis was in good agreement with the intermolecular interactions theory behind these polysaccharides this study further demonstrated that tep determination could provide an intuitionistic evaluation of the complex networks formed from polysaccharides and thus would potentially act as a good indicator of fouling propensity interactions between polysaccharides had been studied in the field of carbohydrate polymers where the reactions and characteristics of polysaccharides were discussed with high concentrations some rules could still be meaningful in the study of foulant interactions to better understand their fouling propensities more detailed understanding of the foulants in feed water is required to provide a new insight into the membrane fouling problems and to illuminate the black box 5 conclusions the current study investigated the intermolecular interactions of polysaccharides in membrane fouling during microfiltration results from resistance analysis filtration data modeling and sem observation of fouled membrane demonstrated that the pore blocking may dominate in the filtration of alginate sodium while the cake layer formation took the main responsibility for the xanthan gum fouling the mixture of two polysaccharides clogged membrane pores and also developed cake layer on membrane resulting with the most severe fouling phenomenon these results could be explained by combining the structure function of polysaccharides with their fouling propensity intermolecular interaction of polysaccharides determined the size of polysaccharides aggregations which further significantly influence the fouling development during filtration these results were consistent with the tep measurements consequently the filtration behaviours of polysaccharides foulants were closely related to their intermolecular interactions it is of great significance to combine the structure function knowledge of polysaccharides with their fouling propensity tep measurement which provided an intuitionistic evaluation of the complex networks formed from interactions of polysaccharides could act as a good indicator for fouling potential in studying membrane fouling

19412,in this work transformation of bisphenol a bpa alternatives bisphenol af bpaf and bisphenol s bps by manganese dioxide mno2 and the effect of iodide i during these processes were investigated in comparison with bpa for the first time these three bisphenols showed appreciable reactivity towards mno2 with the half lives of their loss following the order of bpa bpaf bps under similar conditions and a higher transformation efficiency was generally obtained at a lower ph the presence of i apparently accelerated the transformation of bpaf and bps by mno2 at ph 7 but negligibly affected bpa transformation over the ph range of 5 9 this discrepancy could be well explained by the relative contribution of hypoiodous acid hoi in situ formed from i oxidation by mno2 polymers hydroxylated derivatives and bond cleavage products were detected from bpaf and bps treated by mno2 where a series of reactions of bpaf bps radicals formed from one electron oxidation of bpaf bps were likely involved similar to the case of bpa reported in literature a group of iodinated aromatic products were additionally identified from bpaf bps treated by mno2 in the presence of i e g iodinated bpaf bps and iodinated bpaf bps dimers and they could be further transformed this study suggests that naturally occurring manganese oxides play a significant role in the attenuation of bisphenols released into the environment and the presence of i can display a great effect on their transformation graphical abstract image 1 keywords manganese dioxide mno2 bisphenols iodide i bisphenol af bpaf bisphenol s bps iodinated aromatic products 1 introduction bisphenol a bpa has been widely used in commercial applications as a polymerization inhibitor in pvc pipes or as a monomer in synthesis of polycarbonates geens et al 2012 widespread occurrence of bpa in water and foods via leakage from packaging or storage containers has raised great public concerns due to its endocrine disrupting effects cao and corriveau 2008 lim et al 2009 hence many countries have made strict limits to the use or sales of bpa in the past few decades staples et al 1998 barroso 2011 as a consequence bpa alternatives like bisphenol af bpaf and bisphenol s bps that share a similar structure to bpa fig 1 have been introduced into the market and their occurrence in various environmental compartments is also documented yamazaki et al 2015 choi and lee 2017 song et al 2012 for instance song et al 2012 reported that bpaf was detected in most of samples collected around a manufacturing plant with maximum concentration up to 2 0 103 and 331 ng g dry weight dw in sediments and soils respectively liao et al 2012 reported the occurrence of bps in sediments collected from japan korea and china with a highest concentration of 1 97 103 ng g dw unfortunately recent studies demonstrate that bpaf and bps also display endocrine disrupting effects hashimoto and nakamura 2000 fic et al 2013 moreman et al 2017 manganese mn oxides occur in a wide range of environmental settings such as fresh water bodies rocks soils and sediments and ocean floors they are thought to be the strongest naturally occurring oxidants and play a crucial role in affecting the fate and transport of many organic contaminants via sorption hydrolysis and or oxidative transformation zhang and huang 2005a b zhang et al 2008 remucal and ginder vogel 2014 particularly manganese dioxide mno2 as a reactive mineral is capable of oxidizing a variety of phenolic compounds including bisphenols stone 1987 lin et al 2009a b im and löffler 2016 lu et al 2011 for instance lin et al 2009a reported that 99 bpa 4 4 μm was transformed by mno2 800 μm within 6 min at ph 4 5 lu et al 2011 showed that about 90 of bisphenol f bpf 4 4 μm was oxidized by 100 μm mno2 in 20 min at ph 5 5 oxidation products of bpa and bpf by mno2 have been comprehensively investigated in these studies mainly involving radical reactions through one electron oxidation of these bisphenols by mno2 im et al 2015 identified 4 hydroxycumyl alcohol hca as major transformation product for bpa oxidation by mno2 and it could be further mineralized by mno2 with reaction rates lower than these of bpa moreover the mobility of hca was found obviously higher than that of parent bpa which enabled its faster environmental distribution as well as easier access to oxic conditions to be microbial degraded furthermore nakamura et al 2011 showed that hca possessed increased 100 fold higher estrogenic activity relative to bpa these results suggested that mno2 mediated oxidation process was tightly relevant for controlling the fate and bioactivity of bisphenols released into the environment given the structural similarity of bpaf bps to bpa and bpf it is very likely that mno2 will similarly participate in their natural attenuation processes however the issue has not been addressed so far iodide i exists widely in natural environments e g soil minerals and water with concentration usually less than 100 μg l in source water richardson et al 2008 fuge and johnson 1986 reported that the concentration of iodine including i iodate io3 and organic i ranged from 5 to 200 mg kg in soils high i levels over few milligrams per liter are sometimes reported in coastal water and hydraulic fracturing contaminated water parker et al 2014 harkness et al 2015 i can be easily oxidized during chemical oxidation processes generating reactive hypoiodous acid hoi or molecular iodine i2 bichsel and von gunten 1999 liu et al 2001 zhao et al 2016 li et al 2017 which may greatly affect the transformation of phenolic compounds co present vikesland et al 2013 demonstrated that the presence of i remarkably enhanced the transformation rates of bpa triclosan and phenol by chlorine and several iodinated aromatic products were detected therein recent studies by our group found that i showed similar enhancing effects on the transformation of phenolic compounds by permanganate li et al 2018a and peroxymonosulfate li et al 2018b leading to the formation of iodinated aromatic products it is reported that iodinated products are several orders of magnitude more cytotoxic and genotoxic than their chlorinated and brominated analogues plewa et al 2004 richardson et al 2007 2008 particularly iodinated aromatic products are even more toxic than their aliphatic ones pan and zhang 2013 yang and zhang 2013 liu and zhang 2014 and thus have received increasing public concerns considering the ability of mno2 to oxidize i to hoi i2 as reported in previous studies allard et al 2009 gallard et al 2009 there is a great potential that i may also affect the transformation of phenolic compounds by mno2 with the formation of iodinated aromatic products up to date however limited information is known about this issue the objectives of this work were to i examine the transformation efficiency of bpaf and bps by mno2 in comparison with bpa over the ph range of 5 9 ii identify the transformation products of bpaf and bps by mno2 and propose tentative pathways and iii evaluate the effects of i on the transformation efficiency of bpa bpaf

bisphenols by mno2 in the absence of i as fig 2 showed these three bisphenols were very stable in the absence of mno2 however in the presence of mno2 they disappeared from the solution with varied rates following the order of bpa bpaf bps under similar conditions for instance the half lives of bpa bpaf and bps 5 μm loss were about 3 90 and 1800 min respectively in the presence of 100 μm mno2 at ph 5 and then they decreased to about 1 45 and 1800 min respectively as mno2 concentration further increased to 200 μm stone 1987 reported that phenols with electron donating substituents e g alkyl and alkoxy were more susceptible to oxidative degradation by mno2 than phenols with electron withdrawing substituents e g carboxyl nitro and chloro the higher reactivity of bpa vs bpaf and bps towards mno2 was likely due to the electron donating effect of c ch3 2 group vs c cf3 2 and so2 group on the aromatic ring the lower reactivity of bps towards mno2 than bpaf was probably resulted from the stronger electron withdrawing effect of so2 group than c cf3 2 group on the aromatic ring as revealed by the lower pka values of bps 7 42 8 03 vs bpaf 9 13 9 74 lee et al 2005 choi and lee 2017 similar substituent effects of bpa vs bps were also reported during chlorine and permanganate oxidation processes gao et al 2016 2017 2018 jiang et al 2010 transformation of bpa bpaf and bps 5 μm by mno2 100 μm under ph 5 9 conditions was further studied as shown in fig 3 transformation of these three bisphenols by mno2 was highly sensitive to solution ph with a higher transformation rate at a lower ph except for bpa the half lives of bpaf loss were about 90 150 and 360 min at ph 5 6 and 7 respectively and negligible transformation of bpaf 10 within investigated time periods was observed as ph further increased to 8 and 9 in the case of bps appreciable transformation 30 was achieved only at ph 5 within investigated time periods 24 h for bpa the half life of its loss gradually increased from 3 to 20 min with ph increasing from 5 to 8 and it further decreased to 5 min as ph reached to 9 a similar ph dependent rate profile of bpa reaction with mno2 was also reported by lin et al 2009a the change of solution ph might affect the reaction rates in the following aspects i influencing the oxidation potential of mno2 as proton was required for mno2 reducing to mn2 i e 1 2 mno 2 s 2 h e 1 2 mn 2 aq h 2 o for instance the reduction potential of mno2 decreased from 0 99 to 0 76 v as ph increased from 4 to 8 lin et al 2009b ii affecting the speciation of bisphenols in aqueous solution for example undissociated bpaf dominated at ph 9 13 the monoanion prevailed between ph 9 13 and 9 74 while dibasic bpaf was the primary form at ph 9 74 fig s1 it is reported that deprotonated phenols are more susceptible to oxidation than protonated phenols due to their stronger electron donating strength stone 1987 lu et al 2011 jiang et al 2012 2014 pang et al 2014 and iii impacting sorption of bisphenols to oxide surfaces zhang and huang 2003 2005a b it is reported that protonated phenols adsorbs more strongly to mno2 than their deprotonated form zhang and huang 2003 factor ii probably dominated for bpa transformation by mno2 at higher ph which therefore caused its higher transformation efficiency therein the combining effects of factors i and iii might result in the decreased transformation efficiency of bpaf and bps by mno2 at higher ph 3 2 transformation products and pathways of bisphenols by mno2 in the absence of i 3 2 1 transformation products i bpaf five

dimers 3 2 2 transformation pathways based on the tps identified transformation pathways of bpaf and bps by mno2 were tentatively proposed as shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively bpaf bps initially transferred one electron to mno2 leading to the formation of bpaf bps radical r1 with several resonance forms i e r1 0 r1 1 and r1 2 generated from the delocalization of its unpaired electron further r1 underwent three different pathways i oxidation by mno2 forming hydroxylated derivative tp ii and tp vii where ortho rather than meta position was more susceptible to be attacked due to its higher electron density resulting from the electron donating effect of hydroxyl moiety gallard et al 2009 yang et al 2009 ii coupling to each other via carbon carbon c c or carbon oxygen c o forming dimers tp iv v ix and x and iii fragmentation into r2 radical and r3 cation via β scission r3 cation could then trigger a series of substitution reactions for instance r3 cation substituted a proton of water forming tp i and tp vi or substituted a proton of tp i generating tp iii in addition c o coupling between r1 radical and hydroxylated r2 radical could lead to the formation of tp viii similar reaction pathways involving a series of coupling fragmentation substitution and elimination reactions of phenoxy radical were also reported for mno2 reaction with other phenols including bpa lin et al 2009a b 2014 zhang and huang 2003 3 3 transformation efficiency of bisphenols by mno2 in the presence of i transformation of bpa bpaf and bps 5 μm by mno2 100 μm with varied i concentrations 0 15 μm at ph 5 was investigated as fig 6 showed the presence of i obviously enhanced the transformation of bpaf and bps by mno2 but slightly affected bpa transformation this enhancement increased with the increase of i concentration for both bpaf and bps for instance the half lives of bpaf loss were about 60 30 and 22 min respectively in the presence of 5 10 and 15 μm i the half life of bps loss was about 150 min in the presence of 5 μm i and it decreased to about 120 and 90 min respectively with i concentration increasing to 10 and 15 μm transformation of bpa bpaf and bps 5 μm by mno2 100 μm in the presence of 10 μm i under ph 5 9 conditions was compared as fig 7 showed i enhanced transformation of bpaf and bps by mno2 was also observed at ph 6 and 7 with much lower transformation rates than those at ph 5 under similar conditions about 60 and 30 of bpaf were transformed at ph 6 and 7 respectively after 6 h in control experiments without i and it increased to about 70 and 40 respectively in the presence of 10 μm i 15 of bps was transformed at both ph 6 and 7 after 24 h in the absence of i while it increased to about 45 and 25 respectively in the presence of 10 μm i for bpa i negligibly affected its transformation over the investigated ph range 3 4 reaction kinetics of hoi with bisphenols given the ability of mno2 to oxidize i to hoi allard et al 2009 gallard et al 2009 the enhanced transformation of bpaf and bps by mno2 in the presence of i was reasonably explained by the contribution of hoi in situ formed therefore the reaction kinetics of hoi with bpa bpaf and bps at ph 5 9 were further examined previous studies confirmed that the reaction of hoi with phenols followed a generalized second order rate law with first order to both hoi and phenols zhao et al 2017 li et al 2018a the apparent second order rate constants k app for the reactions of hoi with bpa bpaf and bps as a function of ph were displayed in fig 8 as shown k app of these three bisphenols exhibited a similar ph dependency which generally increased with the increase of ph in addition the reactivity of hoi with these bisphenols decreased in the order of bpa bpaf bps for instance the k app values of hoi with bpa bpaf and bps at ph 7 were 86600 5320 8250 445 and 635 24 m 1s 1 respectively a kinetic model involving the reactions between individual acid base species of hoi pk a 10 4 and bisphenols was developed to simulate the obtained ph rate profiles but it failed a similar finding has also been reported in recent studies zhao et al 2017 li et al 2018a where the impacts of buffers i e type speciation and concentration on the reaction rates of hoi with phenols were proposed the slight effects of i on bpa transformation by mno2 over the ph range of 5 9 was likely due to the lower hoi exposures therein as bpa was rapidly transformed by mno2 within short time periods fig 3 in contrast the relatively low reactivities of bpaf and bps towards mno2 vs bpa fig 2 enabled higher hoi exposures which in turn accelerated their transformation by mno2 similar observations were also reported in our recent study dealing with the effect of i on permanganate kmno4 oxidation li et al 2018a where the presence of i significantly enhanced the transformation of phenol and methlyparaben by kmno4 but negligibly affected bpa and triclosan transformation at ph 7 these results were well explained by the much lower reactivity of phenol and methlyparaben towards kmno4 k app 5 5 and 0 35 m 1s 1 respectively than bpa and triclosan k app 34 and 110 m 1s 1 respectively therein which enabled a higher hoi exposure before their complete transformation by kmno4 the negligible impacts of i on the transformation of bpaf and bps by mno2 at ph 8 and 9 were due to the fact that mno2 was unable to oxidize i at ph 8 as has been reported in previous studies allard et al 2009 gallard et al 2009 3 5 formation of iodinated aromatic products from bisphenols treated by mno2 in the presence of i 3 5 1 bpaf i formation of iodinated aromatic products eight iodinated aromatic transformation products i tps 1 8 were additionally identified from bpaf 5 μm treated by mno2 100 μm in the presence

iv or tp v fig s19b moreover similar iodinated aromatic products of i tps 1 4 were also identified from hoi 10 μm reaction with bpaf 5 μm at ph 5 data were not shown ii reaction pathways reaction pathways for bpaf treated by mno2 in the presence of i were tentatively proposed based on the identified i tps as shown in fig 4 bpaf was initially attacked by hoi electrophilic substitution leading to the formation of mono iodinated bpaf i tp 1 which further underwent stepwise substitution by hoi forming di tri tetra iodinated bpaf i tps 2 4 for the generation of the rest iodinated aromatic products i tps 5 8 two pathways might be involved i hoi substitution of tps i v and ii further oxidation of primary i tps 1 4 by mno2 for instance hoi substitution of tp ii might lead to the formation of i tp 5 which could also be formed via further oxidation of i tp 1 by mno2 3 5 2 bps ten iodinated aromatic tps i tps 9 18 were additionally identified from bps 5 μm treated by mno2 100 μm in the presence of i 10 μm at ph 5 by hplc esi qtof the chromatograms and product patterns of i tps 9 18 were shown in figs s20a 28b and other detailed information including retention time accurate mass molecular formula and proposed molecular structure were displayed in table s4 similar to the case of bpaf iodinated bps i e mono di tri tetra bps i tps 9 13 and iodinated products of tps vi x i e i tps 14 18 dominated therein furthermore i tps 9 13 were also detected from hoi 10 μm reaction with bps 5 μm at ph 5 data were not shown the reaction pathways for bps treated by mno2 in the presence of i were displayed in fig 5 where hoi substitution also played a crucial role 3 5 3 evolution of i tps the time course profiles of these i tps generated from bpaf and bps 5 μm treated by mno2 100 μm in the presence of 10 μm i under ph 5 condition were further monitored by hplc esi qqq at mrm mode where iodide 127 was set as the characteristic product ion the peak areas in the mrm analysis were used as representatives of their relative concentrations due to the lack of authentic standards fig 9 a showed the evolution profiles of i tps 1 8 generated in the case of bpaf as can be seen i tp 1 4 and 7 exhibited similar evolution trends where all of them first accumulated and then slowly declined as the reaction continued i tp 1 reached its concentration maxima at about 60 min while the highest concentrations of i tp 4 and i tp 7 were obtained at about 45 and 90 min respectively in contrast the rest i tps i e i tp 2 3 5 6 and 8 gradually increased within the investigated time scale 120 min fig 9b showed the time course profiles of i tps 9 18 formed in the case of bps as shown the concentrations of most i tps kept increasing within the investigated time scale 150 min except for i tp 9 and 17 which reached their maximum concentration at about 90 and 120 min respectively moreover formation of i tps 12 18 initially exhibited a lag phase of about 20 90 min indicating that they might be secondary tps of bps 4 conclusions in this work the transformation efficiency products and pathways of bpa alternatives bpaf and bps by mno2 as well as impacts of i during these processes were investigated the following conclusions can be obtained 1 all these three bisphenols bpa bpaf and bps showed appreciable reactivity towards mno2 with the half lives of their loss following the order of bpa bpaf bps under similar conditions for example the half lives of bpa bpaf and bps 5 μm by mno2 100 μm at ph 5 were about 3 90 and 1800 min respectively furthermore a higher transformation efficiency was generally obtained at a lower ph 2 the presence of i apparently accelerated the transformation of bpaf and bps by mno2 at ph 7 with stronger enhancement at higher i concentrations while i negligibly affected bpa transformation over the ph range of 5 9 these results could be well explained by the relative contribution of hoi in situ formed from i oxidation by mno2 3 hoi exhibited high reactivity towards these three bisphenols with apparent second order rate constants k app following the order of bpa bpaf bps under similar conditions for instance the k app values of hoi with bpa bpaf and bps at ph 7 were determined to be 86600 5320 8250 445 and 635 24 m 1s 1 respectively 4 polymers hydroxylated derivatives and bond cleavage products were detected from bpaf and bps treated by mno2 reaction pathways involving a series of reactions e g coupling hydroxylation substitution and fragmentation of bpaf bps radicals formed from one electron oxidation of bpaf bps were tentatively proposed 5 iodinated aromatic products e g iodinated bpaf bps and iodinated bpaf bps dimers were additionally identified from bpaf bps treated by mno2 in the presence of i mainly resulting from the electrophilic substitution reactions of hoi and or further oxidation of primary iodinated products by mno2 evolution kinetic analysis of these iodinated aromatic products suggested that they could be

19412,in this work transformation of bisphenol a bpa alternatives bisphenol af bpaf and bisphenol s bps by manganese dioxide mno2 and the effect of iodide i during these processes were investigated in comparison with bpa for the first time these three bisphenols showed appreciable reactivity towards mno2 with the half lives of their loss following the order of bpa bpaf bps under similar conditions and a higher transformation efficiency was generally obtained at a lower ph the presence of i apparently accelerated the transformation of bpaf and bps by mno2 at ph 7 but negligibly affected bpa transformation over the ph range of 5 9 this discrepancy could be well explained by the relative contribution of hypoiodous acid hoi in situ formed from i oxidation by mno2 polymers hydroxylated derivatives and bond cleavage products were detected from bpaf and bps treated by mno2 where a series of reactions of bpaf bps radicals formed from one electron oxidation of bpaf bps were likely involved similar to the case of bpa reported in literature a group of iodinated aromatic products were additionally identified from bpaf bps treated by mno2 in the presence of i e g iodinated bpaf bps and iodinated bpaf bps dimers and they could be further transformed this study suggests that naturally occurring manganese oxides play a significant role in the attenuation of bisphenols released into the environment and the presence of i can display a great effect on their transformation graphical abstract image 1 keywords manganese dioxide mno2 bisphenols iodide i bisphenol af bpaf bisphenol s bps iodinated aromatic products 1 introduction bisphenol a bpa has been widely used in commercial applications as a polymerization inhibitor in pvc pipes or as a monomer in synthesis of polycarbonates geens et al 2012 widespread occurrence of bpa in water and foods via leakage from packaging or storage containers has raised great public concerns due to its endocrine disrupting effects cao and corriveau 2008 lim et al 2009 hence many countries have made strict limits to the use or sales of bpa in the past few decades staples et al 1998 barroso 2011 as a consequence bpa alternatives like bisphenol af bpaf and bisphenol s bps that share a similar structure to bpa fig 1 have been introduced into the market and their occurrence in various environmental compartments is also documented yamazaki et al 2015 choi and lee 2017 song et al 2012 for instance song et al 2012 reported that bpaf was detected in most of samples collected around a manufacturing plant with maximum concentration up to 2 0 103 and 331 ng g dry weight dw in sediments and soils respectively liao et al 2012 reported the occurrence of bps in sediments collected from japan korea and china with a highest concentration of 1 97 103 ng g dw unfortunately recent studies demonstrate that bpaf and bps also display endocrine disrupting effects hashimoto and nakamura 2000 fic et al 2013 moreman et al 2017 manganese mn oxides occur in a wide range of environmental settings such as fresh water bodies rocks soils and sediments and ocean floors they are thought to be the strongest naturally occurring oxidants and play a crucial role in affecting the fate and transport of many organic contaminants via sorption hydrolysis and or oxidative transformation zhang and huang 2005a b zhang et al 2008 remucal and ginder vogel 2014 particularly manganese dioxide mno2 as a reactive mineral is capable of oxidizing a variety of phenolic compounds including bisphenols stone 1987 lin et al 2009a b im and löffler 2016 lu et al 2011 for instance lin et al 2009a reported that 99 bpa 4 4 μm was transformed by mno2 800 μm within 6 min at ph 4 5 lu et al 2011 showed that about 90 of bisphenol f bpf 4 4 μm was oxidized by 100 μm mno2 in 20 min at ph 5 5 oxidation products of bpa and bpf by mno2 have been comprehensively investigated in these studies mainly involving radical reactions through one electron oxidation of these bisphenols by mno2 im et al 2015 identified 4 hydroxycumyl alcohol hca as major transformation product for bpa oxidation by mno2 and it could be further mineralized by mno2 with reaction rates lower than these of bpa moreover the mobility of hca was found obviously higher than that of parent bpa which enabled its faster environmental distribution as well as easier access to oxic conditions to be microbial degraded furthermore nakamura et al 2011 showed that hca possessed increased 100 fold higher estrogenic activity relative to bpa these results suggested that mno2 mediated oxidation process was tightly relevant for controlling the fate and bioactivity of bisphenols released into the environment given the structural similarity of bpaf bps to bpa and bpf it is very likely that mno2 will similarly participate in their natural attenuation processes however the issue has not been addressed so far iodide i exists widely in natural environments e g soil minerals and water with concentration usually less than 100 μg l in source water richardson et al 2008 fuge and johnson 1986 reported that the concentration of iodine including i iodate io3 and organic i ranged from 5 to 200 mg kg in soils high i levels over few milligrams per liter are sometimes reported in coastal water and hydraulic fracturing contaminated water parker et al 2014 harkness et al 2015 i can be easily oxidized during chemical oxidation processes generating reactive hypoiodous acid hoi or molecular iodine i2 bichsel and von gunten 1999 liu et al 2001 zhao et al 2016 li et al 2017 which may greatly affect the transformation of phenolic compounds co present vikesland et al 2013 demonstrated that the presence of i remarkably enhanced the transformation rates of bpa triclosan and phenol by chlorine and several iodinated aromatic products were detected therein recent studies by our group found that i showed similar enhancing effects on the transformation of phenolic compounds by permanganate li et al 2018a and peroxymonosulfate li et al 2018b leading to the formation of iodinated aromatic products it is reported that iodinated products are several orders of magnitude more cytotoxic and genotoxic than their chlorinated and brominated analogues plewa et al 2004 richardson et al 2007 2008 particularly iodinated aromatic products are even more toxic than their aliphatic ones pan and zhang 2013 yang and zhang 2013 liu and zhang 2014 and thus have received increasing public concerns considering the ability of mno2 to oxidize i to hoi i2 as reported in previous studies allard et al 2009 gallard et al 2009 there is a great potential that i may also affect the transformation of phenolic compounds by mno2 with the formation of iodinated aromatic products up to date however limited information is known about this issue the objectives of this work were to i examine the transformation efficiency of bpaf and bps by mno2 in comparison with bpa over the ph range of 5 9 ii identify the transformation products of bpaf and bps by mno2 and propose tentative pathways and iii evaluate the effects of i on the transformation efficiency of bpa bpaf and bps as well as products of bpaf and bps by mno2 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials bpa bpaf bps and ki purchased from j k scientific ltd were used without further purification all solutions were prepared using deionized di water from a milli q purification system millipore billerica ma stock solutions of mno2 were synthesized according to murray s method murray 1974 and were standardized by determining total manganese concentration with inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer after dissolution by ascorbic acid as reported in our previous studies jiang et al 2015 2 2 experimental procedures 2 2 1 transformation of bisphenols by mno2 in the absence presence of i batch reactions were conducted in 100 ml amber borosilicate glass bottles in 25 1 c water

some of these samples were also analyzed for identification of transformation products by hplc electrospray ionization quadrupole time of flight qtof mass spectrometer hplc esi qtof moreover samples obtained in the presence of i were further analyzed by hplc electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometer hplc esi qqq to obtain the evolution kinetics of iodinated aromatic transformation products identified therein 2 2 2 reaction kinetics of hoi with bisphenols kinetics of hoi reaction with bpa bpaf and bps over the ph range of 5 9 were investigated by a sequential

bisphenols by mno2 in the absence of i as fig 2 showed these three bisphenols were very stable in the absence of mno2 however in the presence of mno2 they disappeared from the solution with varied rates following the order of bpa bpaf bps under similar conditions for instance the half lives of bpa bpaf and bps 5 μm loss were about 3 90 and 1800 min respectively in the presence of 100 μm mno2 at ph 5 and then they decreased to about 1 45 and 1800 min respectively as mno2 concentration further increased to 200 μm stone 1987 reported that phenols with electron donating substituents e g alkyl and alkoxy were more susceptible to oxidative degradation by mno2 than phenols with electron withdrawing substituents e g carboxyl nitro and chloro the higher reactivity of bpa vs bpaf and bps towards mno2 was likely due to the electron donating effect of c ch3 2 group vs c cf3 2 and so2 group on the aromatic ring the lower reactivity of bps towards mno2 than bpaf was probably resulted from the stronger electron withdrawing effect of so2 group than c cf3 2 group on the aromatic ring as revealed by the lower pka values of bps 7 42 8 03 vs bpaf 9 13 9 74 lee et al 2005 choi and lee 2017 similar substituent effects of bpa vs bps were also reported during chlorine and permanganate oxidation processes gao et al 2016 2017 2018 jiang et al 2010 transformation of bpa bpaf and bps 5 μm by mno2 100 μm under ph 5 9 conditions was further studied as shown in fig 3 transformation of these three bisphenols by mno2 was highly sensitive to solution ph with a higher transformation rate at a lower ph except for bpa the half lives of bpaf loss were about 90 150 and 360 min at ph 5 6 and 7 respectively and negligible transformation of bpaf 10 within investigated time periods was observed as ph further increased to 8 and 9 in the case of bps appreciable transformation 30 was achieved only at ph 5 within investigated time periods 24 h for bpa the half life of its loss gradually increased from 3 to 20 min with ph increasing from 5 to 8 and it further decreased to 5 min as ph reached to 9 a similar ph dependent rate profile of bpa reaction with mno2 was also reported by lin et al 2009a the change of solution ph might affect the reaction rates in the following aspects i influencing the oxidation potential of mno2 as proton was required for mno2 reducing to mn2 i e 1 2 mno 2 s 2 h e 1 2 mn 2 aq h 2 o for instance the reduction potential of mno2 decreased from 0 99 to 0 76 v as ph increased from 4 to 8 lin et al 2009b ii affecting the speciation of bisphenols in aqueous solution for example undissociated bpaf dominated at ph 9 13 the monoanion prevailed between ph 9 13 and 9 74 while dibasic bpaf was the primary form at ph 9 74 fig s1 it is reported that deprotonated phenols are more susceptible to oxidation than protonated phenols due to their stronger electron donating strength stone 1987 lu et al 2011 jiang et al 2012 2014 pang et al 2014 and iii impacting sorption of bisphenols to oxide surfaces zhang and huang 2003 2005a b it is reported that protonated phenols adsorbs more strongly to mno2 than their deprotonated form zhang and huang 2003 factor ii probably dominated for bpa transformation by mno2 at higher ph which therefore caused its higher transformation efficiency therein the combining effects of factors i and iii might result in the decreased transformation efficiency of bpaf and bps by mno2 at higher ph 3 2 transformation products and pathways of bisphenols by mno2 in the absence of i 3 2 1 transformation products i bpaf five

dimers 3 2 2 transformation pathways based on the tps identified transformation pathways of bpaf and bps by mno2 were tentatively proposed as shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively bpaf bps initially transferred one electron to mno2 leading to the formation of bpaf bps radical r1 with several resonance forms i e r1 0 r1 1 and r1 2 generated from the delocalization of its unpaired electron further r1 underwent three different pathways i oxidation by mno2 forming hydroxylated derivative tp ii and tp vii where ortho rather than meta position was more susceptible to be attacked due to its higher electron density resulting from the electron donating effect of hydroxyl moiety gallard et al 2009 yang et al 2009 ii coupling to each other via carbon carbon c c or carbon oxygen c o forming dimers tp iv v ix and x and iii fragmentation into r2 radical and r3 cation via β scission r3 cation could then trigger a series of substitution reactions for instance r3 cation substituted a proton of water forming tp i and tp vi or substituted a proton of tp i generating tp iii in addition c o coupling between r1 radical and hydroxylated r2 radical could lead to the formation of tp viii similar reaction pathways involving a series of coupling fragmentation substitution and elimination reactions of phenoxy radical were also reported for mno2 reaction with other phenols including bpa lin et al 2009a b 2014 zhang and huang 2003 3 3 transformation efficiency of bisphenols by mno2 in the presence of i transformation of bpa bpaf and bps 5 μm by mno2 100 μm with varied i concentrations 0 15 μm at ph 5 was investigated as fig 6 showed the presence of i obviously enhanced the transformation of bpaf and bps by mno2 but slightly affected bpa transformation this enhancement increased with the increase of i concentration for both bpaf and bps for instance the half lives of bpaf loss were about 60 30 and 22 min respectively in the presence of 5 10 and 15 μm i the half life of bps loss was about 150 min in the presence of 5 μm i and it decreased to about 120 and 90 min respectively with i concentration increasing to 10 and 15 μm transformation of bpa bpaf and bps 5 μm by mno2 100 μm in the presence of 10 μm i under ph 5 9 conditions was compared as fig 7 showed i enhanced transformation of bpaf and bps by mno2 was also observed at ph 6 and 7 with much lower transformation rates than those at ph 5 under similar conditions about 60 and 30 of bpaf were transformed at ph 6 and 7 respectively after 6 h in control experiments without i and it increased to about 70 and 40 respectively in the presence of 10 μm i 15 of bps was transformed at both ph 6 and 7 after 24 h in the absence of i while it increased to about 45 and 25 respectively in the presence of 10 μm i for bpa i negligibly affected its transformation over the investigated ph range 3 4 reaction kinetics of hoi with bisphenols given the ability of mno2 to oxidize i to hoi allard et al 2009 gallard et al 2009 the enhanced transformation of bpaf and bps by mno2 in the presence of i was reasonably explained by the contribution of hoi in situ formed therefore the reaction kinetics of hoi with bpa bpaf and bps at ph 5 9 were further examined previous studies confirmed that the reaction of hoi with phenols followed a generalized second order rate law with first order to both hoi and phenols zhao et al 2017 li et al 2018a the apparent second order rate constants k app for the reactions of hoi with bpa bpaf and bps as a function of ph were displayed in fig 8 as shown k app of these three bisphenols exhibited a similar ph dependency which generally increased with the increase of ph in addition the reactivity of hoi with these bisphenols decreased in the order of bpa bpaf bps for instance the k app values of hoi with bpa bpaf and bps at ph 7 were 86600 5320 8250 445 and 635 24 m 1s 1 respectively a kinetic model involving the reactions between individual acid base species of hoi pk a 10 4 and bisphenols was developed to simulate the obtained ph rate profiles but it failed a similar finding has also been reported in recent studies zhao et al 2017 li et al 2018a where the impacts of buffers i e type speciation and concentration on the reaction rates of hoi with phenols were proposed the slight effects of i on bpa transformation by mno2 over the ph range of 5 9 was likely due to the lower hoi exposures therein as bpa was rapidly transformed by mno2 within short time periods fig 3 in contrast the relatively low reactivities of bpaf and bps towards mno2 vs bpa fig 2 enabled higher hoi exposures which in turn accelerated their transformation by mno2 similar observations were also reported in our recent study dealing with the effect of i on permanganate kmno4 oxidation li et al 2018a where the presence of i significantly enhanced the transformation of phenol and methlyparaben by kmno4 but negligibly affected bpa and triclosan transformation at ph 7 these results were well explained by the much lower reactivity of phenol and methlyparaben towards kmno4 k app 5 5 and 0 35 m 1s 1 respectively than bpa and triclosan k app 34 and 110 m 1s 1 respectively therein which enabled a higher hoi exposure before their complete transformation by kmno4 the negligible impacts of i on the transformation of bpaf and bps by mno2 at ph 8 and 9 were due to the fact that mno2 was unable to oxidize i at ph 8 as has been reported in previous studies allard et al 2009 gallard et al 2009 3 5 formation of iodinated aromatic products from bisphenols treated by mno2 in the presence of i 3 5 1 bpaf i formation of iodinated aromatic products eight iodinated aromatic transformation products i tps 1 8 were additionally identified from bpaf 5 μm treated by mno2 100 μm in the presence

iv or tp v fig s19b moreover similar iodinated aromatic products of i tps 1 4 were also identified from hoi 10 μm reaction with bpaf 5 μm at ph 5 data were not shown ii reaction pathways reaction pathways for bpaf treated by mno2 in the presence of i were tentatively proposed based on the identified i tps as shown in fig 4 bpaf was initially attacked by hoi electrophilic substitution leading to the formation of mono iodinated bpaf i tp 1 which further underwent stepwise substitution by hoi forming di tri tetra iodinated bpaf i tps 2 4 for the generation of the rest iodinated aromatic products i tps 5 8 two pathways might be involved i hoi substitution of tps i v and ii further oxidation of primary i tps 1 4 by mno2 for instance hoi substitution of tp ii might lead to the formation of i tp 5 which could also be formed via further oxidation of i tp 1 by mno2 3 5 2 bps ten iodinated aromatic tps i tps 9 18 were additionally identified from bps 5 μm treated by mno2 100 μm in the presence of i 10 μm at ph 5 by hplc esi qtof the chromatograms and product patterns of i tps 9 18 were shown in figs s20a 28b and other detailed information including retention time accurate mass molecular formula and proposed molecular structure were displayed in table s4 similar to the case of bpaf iodinated bps i e mono di tri tetra bps i tps 9 13 and iodinated products of tps vi x i e i tps 14 18 dominated therein furthermore i tps 9 13 were also detected from hoi 10 μm reaction with bps 5 μm at ph 5 data were not shown the reaction pathways for bps treated by mno2 in the presence of i were displayed in fig 5 where hoi substitution also played a crucial role 3 5 3 evolution of i tps the time course profiles of these i tps generated from bpaf and bps 5 μm treated by mno2 100 μm in the presence of 10 μm i under ph 5 condition were further monitored by hplc esi qqq at mrm mode where iodide 127 was set as the characteristic product ion the peak areas in the mrm analysis were used as representatives of their relative concentrations due to the lack of authentic standards fig 9 a showed the evolution profiles of i tps 1 8 generated in the case of bpaf as can be seen i tp 1 4 and 7 exhibited similar evolution trends where all of them first accumulated and then slowly declined as the reaction continued i tp 1 reached its concentration maxima at about 60 min while the highest concentrations of i tp 4 and i tp 7 were obtained at about 45 and 90 min respectively in contrast the rest i tps i e i tp 2 3 5 6 and 8 gradually increased within the investigated time scale 120 min fig 9b showed the time course profiles of i tps 9 18 formed in the case of bps as shown the concentrations of most i tps kept increasing within the investigated time scale 150 min except for i tp 9 and 17 which reached their maximum concentration at about 90 and 120 min respectively moreover formation of i tps 12 18 initially exhibited a lag phase of about 20 90 min indicating that they might be secondary tps of bps 4 conclusions in this work the transformation efficiency products and pathways of bpa alternatives bpaf and bps by mno2 as well as impacts of i during these processes were investigated the following conclusions can be obtained 1 all these three bisphenols bpa bpaf and bps showed appreciable reactivity towards mno2 with the half lives of their loss following the order of bpa bpaf bps under similar conditions for example the half lives of bpa bpaf and bps 5 μm by mno2 100 μm at ph 5 were about 3 90 and 1800 min respectively furthermore a higher transformation efficiency was generally obtained at a lower ph 2 the presence of i apparently accelerated the transformation of bpaf and bps by mno2 at ph 7 with stronger enhancement at higher i concentrations while i negligibly affected bpa transformation over the ph range of 5 9 these results could be well explained by the relative contribution of hoi in situ formed from i oxidation by mno2 3 hoi exhibited high reactivity towards these three bisphenols with apparent second order rate constants k app following the order of bpa bpaf bps under similar conditions for instance the k app values of hoi with bpa bpaf and bps at ph 7 were determined to be 86600 5320 8250 445 and 635 24 m 1s 1 respectively 4 polymers hydroxylated derivatives and bond cleavage products were detected from bpaf and bps treated by mno2 reaction pathways involving a series of reactions e g coupling hydroxylation substitution and fragmentation of bpaf bps radicals formed from one electron oxidation of bpaf bps were tentatively proposed 5 iodinated aromatic products e g iodinated bpaf bps and iodinated bpaf bps dimers were additionally identified from bpaf bps treated by mno2 in the presence of i mainly resulting from the electrophilic substitution reactions of hoi and or further oxidation of primary iodinated products by mno2 evolution kinetic analysis of these iodinated aromatic products suggested that they could be further transformed acknowledgment this work was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china 51578203 the national key research and development program 2016yfc0401107 and

19413,membrane biofouling due to soluble microbial products smp and extracellular polymeric substances eps deposition results in reduction of the performance of membrane bioreactors mbrs however recently a new method of biofouling control has been developed utilizing the interference of the bacterial inter and intra species communication bacteria use quorum sensing qs to regulate the production of smp and eps therefore disruption of quorum sensing quorum quenching qq by enzymes or microorganisms may be a simple mean to control membrane biofouling in the present study a novel qq bacterium namely lactobacillus sp sbr04ma was isolated from municipal wastewater sludge and its ability to mitigate biofouling was evaluated by monitoring the changes in critical flux and transmembrane pressure along with the production of eps and smp in a lab scale mbr system treating synthetic wastewater lactobacillus sp sbr04ma showed great potential for biofouling control which was evidenced by the 3 fold increase in critical flux 8 3 24 25 l m2 h as well as by reduction of the smp and eps production which was lower during the qq period when compared against the control period furthermore the addition of the qq strain did not affect the cod removal rate results suggested that lactobacillus sp sbr04ma represents a novel and promising strain for biofouling mitigation and enhancement of mbrs performance graphical abstract image 1 keywords membrane biofouling membrane bioreactor quorum quenching critical flux soluble microbial products extracellular polymeric substances 1 introduction membrane bioreactor mbr technology is based on the combination of activated sludge process and membrane filtration resulting to a high quality effluent le clech et al 2006 it comprises a promising method for the treatment of a large number of wastewater types mostly due to several benefits over the conventional activated sludge process such as the application of higher volumetric loading rates less sludge production reduced footprint improved nitrogen nitrification and reduced requirement for disinfection of the treated wastewater banti et al 2017 however the universal use of mbrs is limited due to membrane biofouling drews 2010 the latter is attributed to deposition of substances released by sludge microflora on the membrane surface and or inside the membrane pores resulting in loss of permeability rise of transmembrane pressure tmp and finally failure of the membranes and cost increase due to the requirement of frequent chemical cleaning meng et al 2017 the particular substances involved in membrane biofouling are commonly referred to as soluble microbial products smp and extracellular polymeric substances eps le clech et al 2006 eps are usually referred as biopolymers that are excreted by sludge microflora and compose the biofilm matrix that encapsulates microorganisms in the biofilm and the flocs eps cause pore blockage due to adhesive forces with membrane s surface and the formation of biocake layer that blocks liquid filtration le clech et al 2006 drews 2010 gkotsis et al 2014 smp are referred as biopolymers excreted by bacteria that are not associated with the cell surface but they play a key role in the development of the biofilm and the internal pore fouling having a great impact on membrane fouling lin et al 2014 the mitigation of biofouling by advanced physical and chemical methods such as addition of coagulants has been proven to be ineffective cost expensive and to impair the wastewater treatment performance calderón et al 2011 judd 2008 tao et al 2005 therefore development of new fouling control measures is required utilizing a different approach under this concept the intrinsic microbiological nature of biofouling should be carefully taken into account for the development of an efficient technique malaeb et al 2013 the novel methods based on microbiological approaches that have been developed the last years are mainly based on energy uncoupling enzymatic degradation of eps and quorum quenching shi et al 2017 quorum quenching qq is a new method that utilizes the microbiological background of biofouling through the disruption of quorum sensing qs yeon et al 2009 qs is a process where the bacteria use small molecular transmitters for intracellular and interspecies communication shrout and nerenberg 2012 through quorum sensing bacteria can synchronize their gene and phenotype expression such as antibiotic resistance virulence and eps and smp production in a cell density depended manner chan et al 2009 there are several types of signals for intra species or interspecies communication gram positive bacteria use small peptides while gram negative use n acyl l homoserine lactones ahls usually for interspecies communication lade et al 2014 the application of qq in mbr technology has been mainly focused on the disruption of ahls mediated signaling yeon et al 2009 the specific molecules are amphipathic compounds comprised by an acyl chain and a lactone ring and while they are relatively soluble in water they are able to pass through the cell membranes they are synthesized by luxi type of synthases and they are bound to luxr receptors which are functioning as transcriptional factors huang et al 2016 among the genes that their expression is regulated by the luxr activity there are those related to virulence phenotype and biofilm production several bacterial genera belonging to the proteobacteria phylum such as vibrio pseudomonas and xanthomonas genus have been reported to regulate the expression of eps production via ahl mediated signaling pathways shi et al 2017 in addition phylogenetic studies indicate several bacterial species that belong to the phylum of proteobacteria as the pioneer species of biofouling emergence vanysacker et al 2014 the consistency between the ahls production with eps and biofilm production in activated sludge systems and mbr biofouling rate has been already reported yeon et al 2009 although the use of ahl enzymatic degradation resulted in biofouling reduction in a lab scale mbr bioreactor the small half life of the used enzymes and the cost of their extraction did not support widespread application of the proposed method yeon et al 2009 oh et al 2012 in a few studies related to qq method utilization of microorganisms degrading ahls has been reported as biotechnological tool for biofouling reduction oh et al 2012 cheong et al 2013 2014 until recently the isolation of qq microorganisms was focused on the selection of microorganisms as probiotics uroz et al 2003 or capable to antagonize plant pathogenic bacteria thi et al 2007 oh et al 2012 showed the isolation of qq microorganisms from an mbr system treating municipal wastewater and their application as anti biofouling agents the application of qq microorganisms has been tested in several types of immobilization media oh et al 2012 cheong et al 2013 2014 weerasekara et al 2014 the most satisfying results have been reported by immobilization in alginate beads kim et al 2014 kim et al 2015 maqbool et al 2015 microorganisms with the ability to degrade ahls are considered to be abundant in activated sludge ecosystems however only few strains have been isolated and utilized for biofouling control so far oh et al 2012 cheong et al 2013 therefore isolation of novel quorum quenching strains that may be potentially capable to mitigate biofouling more efficiently and enhance mbr performance is deemed necessary most of the previous studies on qq have utilized high fluxes leading in sharp formation of biofilm due to the forced eps attachment that occurs at such high fluxes oh et al 2012 cheong et al 2013 2014 maqbool et al 2015 consequently the previous works have been focused on the formation of biocake layer on membrane surface due to eps adhesion ignoring the impact of smp and internal pore fouling commercial mbrs normally operate at modest fluxes minimizing the effect of eps on fouling gkotsis et al 2014 however smp have the possibility to enter membrane pores during filtration and partially accumulate in the pores due to their jell like properties causing pore blockage and irreversible membrane fouling rosenberger et al 2006 jiang et al 2010 kunacheva and stuckey 2014 banti et al 2018 in addition the smp along with eps are creating a conditioning film which is altering the membrane characteristics making the membrane prone to floc deposition bos et al 1999 vanysacker et al 2014 specifically the smp are involved in formation of an initial layer on membrane surface due to permeation drag and higher brownian diffusion enhancing therefore the further attachment of eps and flocs having as a result the deterioration of the reversible membrane fouling vanysacker et al 2014 shi et al 2018 smp may be also captured by the formed cake layer through ion bridging increasing the cake resistance shi et al 2018 therefore it is of significant importance to characterize the effect of quorum quenching on smp and eps production aiming to decrease their concentrations and reduce the membrane fouling problem in mbrs furthermore little knowledge exists on the impact of qq on the critical flux critical flux represents an important operation parameter of mbrs and it is defined as the flux below which reversible fouling takes place while tmp remains almost stable le clech et al 2006 marel et al 2009 when operating at fluxes higher than critical flux cake or gel formation is observed by particles or colloids marel et al 2009 smp and eps the primary constituents of biofouling concentration is closely related to critical flux thus the reduction of smp and eps content results usually to higher values of critical fluxes fan et al 2006 therefore critical flux can be used as quantitative parameter used for estimating the filterability of different membranes and different activated sludge mixtures marel et al 2009 the primary objective of the present study is to introduce an innovative solution to mitigate membrane fouling by using a qq strain isolated from municipal wastewater sludge and capable of degrading ahls τhe aims of the work were the examination of the potential use of the isolated qq strain for biofouling control in a lab scale mbr system the evaluation of the effect of the proposed process on membrane critical flux the study of the variation of tmp δτμp at high membrane flux as a function of operation time the assessment of mixed liquor filterability during long term mbr operation and the examination of the effect of the qq strain addition on the content of microbial products and especially on the most important membrane foulants i e smp and eps 2 materials and methods 2 1 isolation of quorum quenching qq bacteria ahl degrading strains were isolated from the activated sludge of a pilot scale mbr system treating municipal wastewater the enrichment procedure was followed as described by chan et al 2009 the sludge sample was left to settle and the supernatant was centrifuged at 17 500 g for 10 min the resulting solid phase was washed with kg medium and resuspended in 1 ml of kg medium the suspension was inoculated in a modified sterile kg medium containing 2 5 mm n hexanoyl l homoserine lactone c6 hsl cayman chemical company ann arbor mi usa as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen and kg medium as a source of inorganic nutrients in this work nahso4 and mncl2 were replaced by mnso4 after three days a sample was withdrawn from the inoculation and transferred to fresh minimal medium to enrich c6 hsl metabolizing microorganisms this procedure was repeated three times on the fourth enrichment cycle a diluted suspension was plated onto lb agar single colonies were picked and repeatedly streaked on lb agar to obtain pure colonies 2 2 assay for determining c6 hsl concentration the determination of c6 hsl concentration was achieved using the biosensor strain chromobacterium violaceum cv026 spanish type culture collection valencia spain the biosensor strain cannot produce ahls by itself however when cultured in a medium containing ahls a violet pigment violacein is produced mcclean et al 1997 double layer agar plates were used for the bioassay the first layer was formed by pouring agar 1 75 w v the second layer was formed using agar solution 9 8 ml cooled at 49 c fortified with 200 μl of cv026 culture od600 0 1 and kanamycin sigma aldrich st louis mo usa to a final concentration of 25 μg ml and a final agar concentration of 0 8 w v the suspension was poured and left to solidify to form a second agar layer containing the strain cv026 wells of 5 mm were made using the thick end of pasteur pipette and a sample of 25 μl of solution containing c6 hsl was placed in the wells after 24 h incubation a violet circle was observed accordingly with c6 hsl concentration in the solution using known concentration solutions a standard curve was constructed 2 3 quorum quenching activity assay for the determination of quorum quenching activity the isolated strains were cultured for 4 5 days and then centrifuged at 17 500 g for 10 min the pellet was suspended in sterile buffer solution containing tris hcl 50 mm ph 7 0 until od600 1 0 was obtained four milliliters of the cell suspension were mixed with 1 ml of c6 hsl 250 μμ solution to obtain a final concentration of 50 μm the control sample contained only sterile buffer samples of 300 μl were taken at 0 3 6 9 h the samples were centrifuged at 3000 g for 1 min for the deposition of suspended cells and 25 μl of each sample supernatant were placed in wells of double layer agar containing cv026 the concentration of c6 hsl was calculated using the standard curve of known concentration solutions 2 4 strain identification for the selected isolated qq strain 16s ribosomal dna universal primers namely 8f and 1541r were used for 16srrna pcr with the selected strain dna as template mccaig et al 1994 the pcr amplified part was analyzed by vbc biotech eurofins genomics vienna austria and the sequence was analyzed using the blastn algorithm the sequence of the selected strain was deposited in genbank bethesda md usa 2 5 microbial cell immobilization in alginate beads microbial cell immobilization was carried out in alginate beads as previously described by kim et al 2014 2015 with modification the selected strain which belonged to the lactobacillus genus was firstly inoculated in mrs broth and incubated at 25 c for 1 week the resulting suspension was then centrifuged at 1800 g for 30 min the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of sterile double distilled water ddh2o the suspension contained approximately 96 1011 cells according to the calibration curve calibration curve was prepared by plotting known concentrations cfu ml of lactobacillus suspension versus optical density od600 for the immobilization in alginate beads the suspension 20 ml was mixed gently with 80 ml of sterile sodium alginate to make a 4 w v alginate suspension the latter was then added dropwise with a syringe into 400 ml of 5 w v cacl2 solution the beads formed were allowed to stand in the solution for 4 h prior to addition in the mbr system cell free alginate beads were also prepared and used for the control period 2 6 membrane bioreactor set up and operating conditions a lab scale mbr was used for the evaluation of qq biofouling control with total working volume of 25 l the mbr as depicted in fig 1 comprised an aeration tank at followed by a membrane tank mt containing a submerged hydrophilic flat sheet a4 microfiltration mf membrane module type h 203 kubota corporation banti et al 2017 the membrane module had effective area of 0 11 m2 and 0 4 μm nominal pore diameter intense aeration was provided to the bottom of the mt to scour the cake layer from the membrane s surface the mbr system was equipped with a dissolved oxygen meter three peristaltic pumps an aeration pump a pressure indicator and a thermometer the permeate flux was intermittent and comprised a 10 min operation step and a 2 min relaxation step a plc system was used for monitoring the mbr performance through scada software symantec siemens the parameters that were used for online control and evaluation of system operation included the influent qin transfer from at to mt qt and effluent qeff flowrates qin 0 9 l h qt 2 7 l h qeff 0 9 l h temperature dissolved oxygen concentration and tmp the system was operated at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 27 7 h the plc system was automatically recording the tmp values every 30 s a peristaltic pump was used to transfer mixed liquor from at to mt while part of the mixed liquor recirculated from the mt to at by gravity an activated sludge sample was collected from a full scale wastewater treatment plant sindos thessaloniki greece and was acclimated with the influent used in this work for a period of 3 weeks for both control and qq periods synthetic municipal wastewater was used in this study in order to provide influent with constant properties with the following composition 500 mg l glucose 500 mg l corn starch 56 mg l peptone 200 mg l nh4cl 43 mg l kh2po4 7 22 mg l mgso4 7η2ο 18 mg l mnso4 1 1 mg l feso4 240 mg l nahco3 zhou et al 2014 dissolved oxygen do was adjusted to 2 5 0 5 mg l by regulating air flow and the mlss concentration was 5 5 0 5 g l the critical flux of the mbr was found to be as 8 3 l m2 h and therefore the mbr system operated at influent and effluent fluxes of qin qeff 0 9 l h respectively for both control and qq periods the effect of the strain lactobacillus sp sbr04ma on membrane fouling was studied by operating the bioreactor in two subsequent periods a control period where the system operated with the addition of alginate beads and a qq period by the addition of alginate beads including cells of lactobacillus sp sbr04ma during both periods critical flux was used as an indication of biofouling mitigation potential of the certain strain critical flux was measured in each period before day 0 and after the addition of the beads 2 7 critical flux and δtmp critical flux was used as rational quality parameter of membrane fouling alternative to other filterability tests as it is representative of the real operation of the membrane bioreactor critical flux was estimated according to the improved flux step method developed by marel et al 2009 incorporating intermediate cleaning steps by relaxation to the commonly used flux step method in the present study the flux step values were as follows 8 3 12 25 17 5 24 25 17 5 12 25 and 8 3 l m2 h each flux step was applied for 15 min and was followed by an intermediate relaxation step at a flux of 6 l m2 h for the same time duration δtmp was calculated by subtracting the initial value of tmp at flux 24 25 l m2 h from the tmp values measured at the following time points measurements over a period of 15 min 2 8 extraction and analysis of smp and eps smp and eps fractions were extracted from the mixed liquor following the procedure outlined by hwang et al 2010 and banti et al 2017 with modification briefly 35 ml of the mixed liquor were collected from the mbr system aeration and membrane tanks and subsequently centrifuged at 4000 g for 5 min the supernatant was recovered with a pipette and filtered through a 0 45 μm millipore filter paper the resulting filtrate referred to as the smp fraction was then analyzed for its protein and polysaccharide content according to the methods developed by lowry et al 1951 and dubois et al 1956 respectively regarding eps extraction the pellet obtained after the centrifugation step was suspended in 35 ml of 0 05 w v nacl solution then heated at 60 c in a water bath for 30 min and finally centrifuged at 4000 g for 15 min the supernatant obtained referred to as the eps fraction was then analyzed for its protein and polysaccharide content as described above protein concentrations were calibrated with bovine serum albumin bsa sigma aldrich and polysaccharides with glucose panreac 2 9 chemical oxygen demand cod measurements cod values in influent and effluent samples were determined with standard test kits namely lck 514 100 2000 mg l o2 and lck 1414 5 60 mg l o2 respectively hach lange gmbh düsseldorf germany samples were digested at 148 οc for 2 h in a dry thermostat lt200 hach lange gmbh düsseldorf germany then cooled at 25 c and subsequently measured using a portable spectrophotometer dr 2800 hach lange gmbh düsseldorf germany 2 10 mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and volatile suspended solids mlvss concentrations of mlss and mlvss were determined according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 1999 2 11 microscopic observation of the community the morphology of the activated sludge s microbial community during the different operation periods was studied using light microscopy axio observer z1 zeiss berlin germany samples were placed on glass slides and microscopically observed with the cover slip on a zen microscope and imaging software was employed to process and analyze the images creating jpeg image files of the optical microscopic images 3 results 3 1 isolation of a novel strain degrading n acyl homoserine lactones an activated sludge sample was withdrawn from the mbr system treating municipal wastewater aiming at the isolation of a strain capable to degrade n acyl homoserine lactones four indigenous strains were isolated using the enrichment method described in the materials and methods section the strains were named sbr04ma sbr04mkg sbr04mkd and sbr04kbg the degradation of 50 μμ c6 hsl in 9 h was then investigated in order to justify the ability of the isolated strains to degrade n acyl homoserine lactones three out of the four strains showed the ability to degrade c6 hsl as shown in fig 2 however only the strain sbr04ma was capable to completely degrade 50 μμ c6 hsl in 9 h the particular strain shared 98 sequence identity with 16srrna sequences of lactobacillus plantarum thus hereinafter will be referred to as lactobacillus sp sbr04ma seq id kx812805 3 2 lactobacillus sp sbr04ma biofouling mitigation potential the aim of this work was to study the effect of qq strain on membrane biofouling critical flux was used as an indicator for the assessment of the potential of the certain strain for biofouling control as shown in fig s1 s2 supporting information and s3 the initial value of the critical flux before the addition of alginate beads in the mbr tanks was the same in both periods and specifically it was equal to 8 3 l m2 h however high differences were observed in critical flux in relation to operation time in the control and the qq period critical flux remained constant up to day 15 in the control period as illustrated in fig 3 and fig s1 supporting information in addition it was noticed that the beads started to deteriorate after day 7 due to crushing caused by the recirculation pump the alginate residues did not show any enhancement of system performance or a potential for biofouling prevention nevertheless during the performance of the critical flux run on day 15 it was observed that operating the mbr system at the highest flux 24 25 l m2 h resulted in a sharp increase of tmp to very high values and was attributed to the irreversible deposition of biopolymers inside the membrane pores fig s1 supporting information yamamura et al 2014 during the qq period the critical flux remained almost stable only in the first days of operation fig 3 fig s2 supporting information critical flux was 8 3 l m2 h and the majority of the beads were entrapped in the aeration tank while a fraction of the beads was transported to the membrane tank through recirculation however gradual deterioration of the alginate beads was observed similar to that of the control period resulting in a gradual release of lactobacillus sp sbr04ma cell population to the mixed liquor cell release affected membrane critical flux on day 9 specifically critical flux increased from 8 3 l m2 h to 12 25 l m2 h thereafter critical flux further increased and specifically on day 11 it showed a value of 17 5 l m2 h while on day 18 the critical flux was 20 75 l m2 h and on day 22 critical flux almost reached the highest flux studied 24 25 l m2 h therefore after the release of lactobacillus sp sbr04ma cells critical flux greatly increased and this was observed for extended operation time it seems that cell population was not reduced in relation with time but it retained a prolonged ability to affect the microflora of the mixed liquor and to prevent membrane fouling in order to elucidate the effect of qq mechanism on the membrane s performance the tmp difference δtmp during the 15 min critical flux run at the highest threshold flux 24 25 l m2 h was studied fig 4 for the 15th day of control period and the 18th day of qq period as well as the days before the addition of the alginate beads in each period day 0 for both periods as shown in fig 6 prior to the addition of alginate beads δtmp slightly increased as a result of the short operating time of the membrane and low biofouling rate however as operation time progressed biofouling resulted in pore blocking and rapid tmp increase at the highest flux of 24 25 l m2 h specifically on day 15 of control period δtmp exhibited a very high rate of increase reaching a maximum of 20 kpa after the 15 min critical flux run and this was attributed to potential irreversible deposition of biopolymers into the membrane pores however the addition of the strain resulted in biofouling prevention and δtmp was only slightly affected on day 18 of the qq period but still it was significantly lower when compared to the days before the addition of the alginate beads for both of the periods fig 4 fig s3 supporting information indicating an improvement of mixed liquor filtration characteristics 3 3 smp and eps concentration in the mixed liquor of the bioreactor the average concentrations of eps and smp in samples of the mixed liquor from the two tanks and the effluent were measured in the control and qq periods in order to evaluate the effect of qq on microflora activities and to identify the mechanism of fouling prevention the corresponding results are shown in figs 5 7 in the qq period the average concentrations of protein and polysaccharide fractions of smp and eps were lower in comparison to the control period about 50 reduction of the smp protein fraction was observed in both tanks during the qq period in comparison to the control period a in the aeration tank the average concentration of smp protein fraction was 5 7 mg g vss for the control period whereas in the qq period it was 2 49 mg g vss b in the membrane tank the average concentration of smp protein fraction was 4 8 mg g vss in the control period whereas in qq period it was 1 98 mg g vss about 20 30 reduction was also observed in eps protein fraction concentration during qq period in both tanks a in the aeration tank the eps protein fraction was 39 56 mg g vss in the control period whereas in the qq period the average eps protein concentration was 28 8 mg g vss b in the membrane tank the eps protein fraction was 36 13 mg g vss in the control period in comparison to the qq period where the average eps protein concentration was 25 22 mg g vss carbohydrate concentration of smp and eps in the mixed liquor of the two tanks was reduced by about 50 in the qq period in relation to the control period in the aeration tank average concentration of smp carbohydrate fraction was 3 41 mg g vss during the control period and 1 69 mg g vss for the qq period the average concentration of eps carbohydrate fraction was 16 4 mg g vss for the control period and 6 6 mg g vss for the qq period in the membrane tank the average concentration of smp carbohydrate fraction was 2 72 mg g vss for the control period and 1 47 mg g vss for the qq period the average concentration of eps carbohydrate fraction was 12 47 mg g vss for control period and 6 42 mg g vss for qq period in general lower average concentrations of smp and eps were observed in the mixed liquor of qq period indicating that qq enhances the mbr performance by affecting the production of biopolymers of sludge microflora to further confirm the inhibition of inside pore fouling the smp concentration of the effluent was measured in both periods fig 7 similar results as above were observed smp protein concentration in qq period was reduced by about 1 3 of the corresponding concentration in the control period nevertheless the concentration of carbohydrates in the effluent of the qq period was almost half the concentration of the effluent in the control period the above results indicated that the addition of lactobacillus sp sbr04ma affected the concentration of the inside pore foulants and therefore mitigated the pore fouling the reduction of eps that are excreted by the activated sludge microorganisms is associated with a change in the sludge biocommunity two types of bacterial species are typically found in the mixed liquor of an activated sludge system flocculant producing and filamentous species filamentous bacteria usually provide a scaffold for the other microflora microorganisms while the flocculant producing bacteria contribute to the formation of a biofilm matrix in the form of flocs as mentioned in the introduction section flocs and biofilms are composed of a matrix that is made from eps therefore the reduction of eps is expected to have an impact on the flocs in order to identify potential differences of the mbr microflora during the operation at the two periods mixed liquor samples were withdrawn and were analyzed by an optical microscope after the completion of the control period operation conditions were adjusted to favor the formation of a bulking sludge due to overgrowth of the filamentous population in the mixed liquor resulting to sludge foaming in order to observe and estimate the abundance of filamentous bacteria under abnormal sludge states various sludge samples were observed including the control period sludge abnormal bulking sludge and qq period sludge several differences were observed as shown in fig 8 a during the control period equilibrium was observed between the flocculant producing and filamentous bacteria providing a connective matrix b sample of bulking sludge showed the massive overpopulation of filamentous causing a fibrous entangled lattice that restricts the growth of other bacterial species c samples of qq period showed that the filamentous species prevailed over the flocculant producing nevertheless comparing the above sample with the control period sample and the bulking sludge sample the abundance of filamentous was attributed to the shrinkage of the flocculant producing bacterial matrix rather than to overpopulation of filamentous strains therefore it could be concluded that the reduction of eps concentration that were observed by analytical methods had an impact on the size and the abundance of flocs 3 4 mbr effluent cod characteristics the performance of cod removal of the mbr system for each period was also studied by determining the cod values of both influents and effluents the addition of the qq strain lactobacillus sp sbr04ma not only enhanced the operation of the membrane by preventing biofouling formation but also resulted to an effluent with an average cod value of 18 2 6 5 mg l the average cod value of the influent during the qq period was 737 141 7 mg l which was similar to that of the control period with an average cod value of 659 189 8 mg l the cod value of the effluent during the control period was 23 13 mg l therefore during the control period the cod removal was 96 5 while during the qq period the cod removal was 97 5 consequently cod removal rate and the performance of the bioreactor were not affected by the addition of lactobacillus sp mbr04ma in the system 4 discussion in this study the isolation of a novel qq strain from municipal wastewater sludge was achieved and its potential for biofouling prevention was evidenced by the increase in critical flux 3 fold increase and the reduction in the concentrations of smp and eps in mixed liquor the novel isolated strain belonged to the lactobacillus genus whose member has not been previously isolated from wastewater samples oh et al 2012 cheong et al 2013 strains that belong in the lactobacillus genus have been previously reported to have the ability to block the production of ahls rosenberger et al 2006 in addition the strains that have been isolated and utilized in similar studies belonged to the rhodococcus genus oh et al 2012 and pseudomonas genus cheong et al 2013 such strains may have low pathogenic ability however the novel strain which was identified in the present study belonged to the lactobacillus genus whose members are rarely pathogenic borriello et al 2003 in this study it was justified that quorum quenching significantly increased the critical flux value and therefore mitigated biofouling and improved the overall mbr performance these findings are in accordance with those presented in similar studies e g yeon et al 2009 lee et al 2014 oh et al 2012 maqbool et al 2015 confirming that quorum quenching is a promising method for biofouling prevention the use of alginate beads in the pilot scale mbr was not found to be very promising compared to a similar study where the life of beads is referred to be long about 45 days maqbool et al 2015 whereas in this study the beads started to break down in one week as they passed through the recycling peristaltic pump that transfer the mixed liquor between the two tanks of the experimental system generally the use of alginate beads as an immobilization medium may not be appropriate for commercial mbr applications to date the need of an encapsulation medium has limited the use of the qq strains while most of the studies have focused on the improvement of encapsulation media kim et al 2015 ergön can et al 2017 in the present study it was shown that the new isolated qq strain was potent to mitigate biofouling after the release and uniform distribution of the immobilized cells in the mixed liquor the alginate beads were trapped in the aeration tank where they deteriorated in a period of 7 days it is well established that quorum quenching is much less effective if the qq media are in a different tank jahangir et al 2012 however when the beads deteriorated an increase in the critical flux during the qq period was observed and therefore the isolated strain had a positive effect on mbr performance this improvement was observed after the disintegration of the beads where the bacterial cells were being released in the mixed liquor and distributed uniformly in the bioreactor the released cells were not outcompeted by the indigenous microbial community of the bioreactor since not only they retained the activity of biofouling control for days after the alginate beads degradation but continued to improve the mixed liquor characteristics by increasing the critical flux therefore the bacterial cells in the mixed liquor were capable of surviving and preserving their effect towards the mbr fouling without the presence of the immobilization medium since the functionality of the strain was not affected by the competition from the dominant bacteria of the activated sludge those results are in contrast with most of the related works where the corresponding strains required previous immobilization in appropriate media for their protection in the form of immobilization media against the competitive reactors biocommunity cheong et al 2013 2014 weerasekara et al 2014 kim et al 2015 maqbool et al 2015 ergön can et al 2017 lactobacillus sp sbr04ma proved a strong and effective organism without requirement for its prior encapsulation into an appropriate immobilization medium if it is possible to use the particular strain as a free cell suspension in the mixed liquor this method is going to be cost effective however further studies are required for clarification using municipal and industrial wastewater which may have micropollutants inhibiting the strain s survival rate and its qq activity muñoz et al 2008 the addition of the certain strain showed to minimize significantly the increase of δtmp at the highest flux of 24 25 l m2 h fig 4 figure s3 supporting information this is in agreement with the results of several previous works which showed that quorum quenching is reducing the δtmp increase rate cheong et al 2014 weerasekara et al 2014 kim et al 2015 maqbool et al 2015 when the membrane module was incorporated in the system a similar pressure drop increase was observed ranging from 0 to 3 kpa in 15 min however after 15 days of system operation at 8 3 l m2 h smp and eps conditioning on the membrane resulted in a sharp increase of δtmp however during the qq period insignificant increase of δtmp was measured even after the operation of the membrane for a long time exceeding 18 days as a result it is assumed that lactobacillus sp sbr04ma addition had not only mitigated biofouling but prevented the eps smp conditioning of the membrane surface due to long exposure to mixed liquor moreover several studies have investigated the effect of quorum quenching on mixed liquor eps and smp contents cheong et al 2014 maqbool et al 2015 specifically cheong et al 2014 showed that quorum quenching caused a slight reduction in smp and eps concentration levels whereas maqbool et al 2015 showed high reduction mainly in smp concentration the results of this work were consistent with these studies as it was observed that during the qq period the average smp and eps concentrations were lower in both protein and polysaccharide fractions which are the main foulants of the membrane the impact of eps reduction was also observed in mixed liquor flocs as in qq period their size was smaller than those observed in the control period altering the balance between flocculant and filamentous bacteria furthermore the concentration of smp in the effluent was investigated to confirm that the transfer of smp from the interior of the pores was reduced lower concentrations in both effluent carbohydrate and protein fractions were observed confirming that quorum quenching had also the ability to prevent the internal pore fouling in general quorum quenching significantly affected eps and smp production in mixed liquor nevertheless further studies are needed to clarify this kind of fouling prevention the reduction of eps and smp caused by the qq strain lactobacillus sp sbr04ma did not affect the cod removal rate providing an effluent with cod values lower than 25 mg l this result is in accordance with previous studies cheong et al 2013 2014 kim et al 2014 maqbool et al 2015 where different qq strains were used however further studies are necessary in order to verify the effect of qq strain on the overall reactor performance including nutrients removal yu et al 2018 and treatment of municipal or and industrial wastewater containing compounds persistent to microbial degradation heavy metals dyes antibiotic residues that may affect qq activity 5 conclusions membrane biofouling is the major drawback regarding the widespread application of membrane bioreactors for wastewater treatment to overcome problems associated with biofouling a novel qq bacterium namely lactobacillus sp sbr04ma was isolated from municipal wastewater sludge and its potential to mitigate biofouling was assessed according to the results the certain qq bacterium significantly increased the critical flux of the mbr system 3 fold increase by suppressing smp and eps production which are the main foulants of the membrane cod removal was not affected by the addition of the qq bacterium and average cod removal exceeded 97 overall the particular strain appears to be very promising for biofouling mitigation thus enhancing mbr s performance acknowledgments this research has been co financed by the european union european social fund

19413,membrane biofouling due to soluble microbial products smp and extracellular polymeric substances eps deposition results in reduction of the performance of membrane bioreactors mbrs however recently a new method of biofouling control has been developed utilizing the interference of the bacterial inter and intra species communication bacteria use quorum sensing qs to regulate the production of smp and eps therefore disruption of quorum sensing quorum quenching qq by enzymes or microorganisms may be a simple mean to control membrane biofouling in the present study a novel qq bacterium namely lactobacillus sp sbr04ma was isolated from municipal wastewater sludge and its ability to mitigate biofouling was evaluated by monitoring the changes in critical flux and transmembrane pressure along with the production of eps and smp in a lab scale mbr system treating synthetic wastewater lactobacillus sp sbr04ma showed great potential for biofouling control which was evidenced by the 3 fold increase in critical flux 8 3 24 25 l m2 h as well as by reduction of the smp and eps production which was lower during the qq period when compared against the control period furthermore the addition of the qq strain did not affect the cod removal rate results suggested that lactobacillus sp sbr04ma represents a novel and promising strain for biofouling mitigation and enhancement of mbrs performance graphical abstract image 1 keywords membrane biofouling membrane bioreactor quorum quenching critical flux soluble microbial products extracellular polymeric substances 1 introduction membrane bioreactor mbr technology is based on the combination of activated sludge process and membrane filtration resulting to a high quality effluent le clech et al 2006 it comprises a promising method for the treatment of a large number of wastewater types mostly due to several benefits over the conventional activated sludge process such as the application of higher volumetric loading rates less sludge production reduced footprint improved nitrogen nitrification and reduced requirement for disinfection of the treated wastewater banti et al 2017 however the universal use of mbrs is limited due to membrane biofouling drews 2010 the latter is attributed to deposition of substances released by sludge microflora on the membrane surface and or inside the membrane pores resulting in loss of permeability rise of transmembrane pressure tmp and finally failure of the membranes and cost increase due to the requirement of frequent chemical cleaning meng et al 2017 the particular substances involved in membrane biofouling are commonly referred to as soluble microbial products smp and extracellular polymeric substances eps le clech et al 2006 eps are usually referred as biopolymers that are excreted by sludge microflora and compose the biofilm matrix that encapsulates microorganisms in the biofilm and the flocs eps cause pore blockage due to adhesive forces with membrane s surface and the formation of biocake layer that blocks liquid filtration le clech et al 2006 drews 2010 gkotsis et al 2014 smp are referred as biopolymers excreted by bacteria that are not associated with the cell surface but they play a key role in the development of the biofilm and the internal pore fouling having a great impact on membrane fouling lin et al 2014 the mitigation of biofouling by advanced physical and chemical methods such as addition of coagulants has been proven to be ineffective cost expensive and to impair the wastewater treatment performance calderón et al 2011 judd 2008 tao et al 2005 therefore development of new fouling control measures is required utilizing a different approach under this concept the intrinsic microbiological nature of biofouling should be carefully taken into account for the development of an efficient technique malaeb et al 2013 the novel methods based on microbiological approaches that have been developed the last years are mainly based on energy uncoupling enzymatic degradation of eps and quorum quenching shi et al 2017 quorum quenching qq is a new method that utilizes the microbiological background of biofouling through the disruption of quorum sensing qs yeon et al 2009 qs is a process where the bacteria use small molecular transmitters for intracellular and interspecies communication shrout and nerenberg 2012 through quorum sensing bacteria can synchronize their gene and phenotype expression such as antibiotic resistance virulence and eps and smp production in a cell density depended manner chan et al 2009 there are several types of signals for intra species or interspecies communication gram positive bacteria use small peptides while gram negative use n acyl l homoserine lactones ahls usually for interspecies communication lade et al 2014 the application of qq in mbr technology has been mainly focused on the disruption of ahls mediated signaling yeon et al 2009 the specific molecules are amphipathic compounds comprised by an acyl chain and a lactone ring and while they are relatively soluble in water they are able to pass through the cell membranes they are synthesized by luxi type of synthases and they are bound to luxr receptors which are functioning as transcriptional factors huang et al 2016 among the genes that their expression is regulated by the luxr activity there are those related to virulence phenotype and biofilm production several bacterial genera belonging to the proteobacteria phylum such as vibrio pseudomonas and xanthomonas genus have been reported to regulate the expression of eps production via ahl mediated signaling pathways shi et al 2017 in addition phylogenetic studies indicate several bacterial species that belong to the phylum of proteobacteria as the pioneer species of biofouling emergence vanysacker et al 2014 the consistency between the ahls production with eps and biofilm production in activated sludge systems and mbr biofouling rate has been already reported yeon et al 2009 although the use of ahl enzymatic degradation resulted in biofouling reduction in a lab scale mbr bioreactor the small half life of the used enzymes and the cost of their extraction did not support widespread application of the proposed method yeon et al 2009 oh et al 2012 in a few studies related to qq method utilization of microorganisms degrading ahls has been reported as biotechnological tool for biofouling reduction oh et al 2012 cheong et al 2013 2014 until recently the isolation of qq microorganisms was focused on the selection of microorganisms as probiotics uroz et al 2003 or capable to antagonize plant pathogenic bacteria thi et al 2007 oh et al 2012 showed the isolation of qq microorganisms from an mbr system treating municipal wastewater and their application as anti biofouling agents the application of qq microorganisms has been tested in several types of immobilization media oh et al 2012 cheong et al 2013 2014 weerasekara et al 2014 the most satisfying results have been reported by immobilization in alginate beads kim et al 2014 kim et al 2015 maqbool et al 2015 microorganisms with the ability to degrade ahls are considered to be abundant in activated sludge ecosystems however only few strains have been isolated and utilized for biofouling control so far oh et al 2012 cheong et al 2013 therefore isolation of novel quorum quenching strains that may be potentially capable to mitigate biofouling more efficiently and enhance mbr performance is deemed necessary most of the previous studies on qq have utilized high fluxes leading in sharp formation of biofilm due to the forced eps attachment that occurs at such high fluxes oh et al 2012 cheong et al 2013 2014 maqbool et al 2015 consequently the previous works have been focused on the formation of biocake layer on membrane surface due to eps adhesion ignoring the impact of smp and internal pore fouling commercial mbrs normally operate at modest fluxes minimizing the effect of eps on fouling gkotsis et al 2014 however smp have the possibility to enter membrane pores during filtration and partially accumulate in the pores due to their jell like properties causing pore blockage and irreversible membrane fouling rosenberger et al 2006 jiang et al 2010 kunacheva and stuckey 2014 banti et al 2018 in addition the smp along with eps are creating a conditioning film which is altering the membrane characteristics making the membrane prone to floc deposition bos et al 1999 vanysacker et al 2014 specifically the smp are involved in formation of an initial layer on membrane surface due to permeation drag and higher brownian diffusion enhancing therefore the further attachment of eps and flocs having as a result the deterioration of the reversible membrane fouling vanysacker et al 2014 shi et al 2018 smp may be also captured by the formed cake layer through ion bridging increasing the cake resistance shi et al 2018 therefore it is of significant importance to characterize the effect of quorum quenching on smp and eps production aiming to decrease their concentrations and reduce the membrane fouling problem in mbrs furthermore little knowledge exists on the impact of qq on the critical flux critical flux represents an important operation parameter of mbrs and it is defined as the flux below which reversible fouling takes place while tmp remains almost stable le clech et al 2006 marel et al 2009 when operating at fluxes higher than critical flux cake or gel formation is observed by particles or colloids marel et al 2009 smp and eps the primary constituents of biofouling concentration is closely related to critical flux thus the reduction of smp and eps content results usually to higher values of critical fluxes fan et al 2006 therefore critical flux can be used as quantitative parameter used for estimating the filterability of different membranes and different activated sludge mixtures marel et al 2009 the primary objective of the present study is to introduce an innovative solution to mitigate membrane fouling by using a qq strain isolated from municipal wastewater sludge and capable of degrading ahls τhe aims of the work were the examination of the potential use of the isolated qq strain for biofouling control in a lab scale mbr system the evaluation of the effect of the proposed process on membrane critical flux the study of the variation of tmp δτμp at high membrane flux as a function of operation time the assessment of mixed liquor filterability during long term mbr operation and the examination of the effect of the qq strain addition on the content of microbial products and especially on the most important membrane foulants i e smp and eps 2 materials and methods 2 1 isolation of quorum quenching qq bacteria ahl degrading strains were isolated from the activated sludge of a pilot scale mbr system treating municipal wastewater the enrichment procedure was followed as described by chan et al 2009 the sludge sample was left to settle and the supernatant was centrifuged at 17 500 g for 10 min the resulting solid phase was washed with kg medium and resuspended in 1 ml of kg medium the suspension was inoculated in a modified sterile kg medium containing 2 5 mm n hexanoyl l homoserine lactone c6 hsl cayman chemical company ann arbor mi usa as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen and kg medium as a source of inorganic nutrients in this work nahso4 and mncl2 were replaced by mnso4 after three days a sample was withdrawn from the inoculation and transferred to fresh minimal medium to enrich c6 hsl metabolizing microorganisms this procedure was repeated three times on the fourth enrichment cycle a diluted suspension was plated onto lb agar single colonies were picked and repeatedly streaked on lb agar to obtain pure colonies 2 2 assay for determining c6 hsl concentration the determination of c6 hsl concentration was achieved using the biosensor strain chromobacterium violaceum cv026 spanish type culture collection valencia spain the biosensor strain cannot produce ahls by itself however when cultured in a medium containing ahls a violet pigment violacein is produced mcclean et al 1997 double layer agar plates were used for the bioassay the first layer was formed by pouring agar 1 75 w v the second layer was formed using agar solution 9 8 ml cooled at 49 c fortified with 200 μl of cv026 culture od600 0 1 and kanamycin sigma aldrich st louis mo usa to a final concentration of 25 μg ml and a final agar concentration of 0 8 w v the suspension was poured and left to solidify to form a second agar layer containing the strain cv026 wells of 5 mm were made using the thick end of pasteur pipette and a sample of 25 μl of solution containing c6 hsl was placed in the wells after 24 h incubation a violet circle was observed accordingly with c6 hsl concentration in the solution using known concentration solutions a standard curve was constructed 2 3 quorum quenching activity assay for the determination of quorum quenching activity the isolated strains were cultured for 4 5 days and then centrifuged at 17 500 g for 10 min the pellet was suspended in sterile buffer solution containing tris hcl 50 mm ph 7 0 until od600 1 0 was obtained four milliliters of the cell suspension were mixed with 1 ml of c6 hsl 250 μμ solution to obtain a final concentration of 50 μm the control sample contained only sterile buffer samples of 300 μl were taken at 0 3 6 9 h the samples were centrifuged at 3000 g for 1 min for the deposition of suspended cells and 25 μl of each sample supernatant were placed in wells of double layer agar containing cv026 the concentration of c6 hsl was calculated using the standard curve of known concentration solutions 2 4 strain identification for the selected isolated qq strain 16s ribosomal dna universal primers namely 8f and 1541r were used for 16srrna pcr with the selected strain dna as template mccaig et al 1994 the pcr amplified part was analyzed by vbc biotech eurofins genomics vienna austria and the sequence was analyzed using the blastn algorithm the sequence of the selected strain was deposited in genbank bethesda md usa 2 5 microbial cell immobilization in alginate beads microbial cell immobilization was carried out in alginate beads as previously described by kim et al 2014 2015 with modification the selected strain which belonged to the lactobacillus genus was firstly inoculated in mrs broth and incubated at 25 c for 1 week the resulting suspension was then centrifuged at 1800 g for 30 min the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of sterile double distilled water ddh2o the suspension contained approximately 96 1011 cells according to the calibration curve calibration curve was prepared by plotting known concentrations cfu ml of lactobacillus suspension versus optical density od600 for the immobilization in alginate beads the suspension 20 ml was mixed gently with 80 ml of sterile sodium alginate to make a 4 w v alginate suspension the latter was then added dropwise with a syringe into 400 ml of 5 w v cacl2 solution the beads formed were allowed to stand in the solution for 4 h prior to addition in the mbr system cell free alginate beads were also prepared and used for the control period 2 6 membrane bioreactor set up and operating conditions a lab scale mbr was used for the evaluation of qq biofouling control with total working volume of 25 l the mbr as depicted in fig 1 comprised an aeration tank at followed by a membrane tank mt containing a submerged hydrophilic flat sheet a4 microfiltration mf membrane module type h 203 kubota corporation banti et al 2017 the membrane module had effective area of 0 11 m2 and 0 4 μm nominal pore diameter intense aeration was provided to the bottom of the mt to scour the cake layer from the membrane s surface the mbr system was equipped with a dissolved oxygen meter three peristaltic pumps an aeration pump a pressure indicator and a thermometer the permeate flux was intermittent and comprised a 10 min operation step and a 2 min relaxation step a plc system was used for monitoring the mbr performance through scada software symantec siemens the parameters that were used for online control and evaluation of system operation included the influent qin transfer from at to mt qt and effluent qeff flowrates qin 0 9 l h qt 2 7 l h qeff 0 9 l h temperature dissolved oxygen concentration and tmp the system was operated at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 27 7 h the plc system was automatically recording the tmp values every 30 s a peristaltic pump was used to transfer mixed liquor from at to mt while part of the mixed liquor recirculated from the mt to at by gravity an activated sludge sample was collected from a full scale wastewater treatment plant sindos thessaloniki greece and was acclimated with the influent used in this work for a period of 3 weeks for both control and qq periods synthetic municipal wastewater was used in this study in order to provide influent with constant properties with the following composition 500 mg l glucose 500 mg l corn starch 56 mg l peptone 200 mg l nh4cl 43 mg l kh2po4 7 22 mg l mgso4 7η2ο 18 mg l mnso4 1 1 mg l feso4 240 mg l nahco3 zhou et al 2014 dissolved oxygen do was adjusted to 2 5 0 5 mg l by regulating air flow and the mlss concentration was 5 5 0 5 g l the critical flux of the mbr was found to be as 8 3 l m2 h and therefore the mbr system operated at influent and effluent fluxes of qin qeff 0 9 l h respectively for both control and qq periods the effect of the strain lactobacillus sp sbr04ma on membrane fouling was studied by operating the bioreactor in two subsequent periods a control period where the system operated with the addition of alginate beads and a qq period by the addition of alginate beads including cells of lactobacillus sp sbr04ma during both periods critical flux was used as an indication of biofouling mitigation potential of the certain strain critical flux was measured in each period before day 0 and after the addition of the beads 2 7 critical flux and δtmp critical flux was used as rational quality parameter of membrane fouling alternative to other filterability tests as it is representative of the real operation of the membrane bioreactor critical flux was estimated according to the improved flux step method developed by marel et al 2009 incorporating intermediate cleaning steps by relaxation to the commonly used flux step method in the present study the flux step values were as follows 8 3 12 25 17 5 24 25 17 5 12 25 and 8 3 l m2 h each flux step was applied for 15 min and was followed by an intermediate relaxation step at a flux of 6 l m2 h for the same time duration δtmp was calculated by subtracting the initial value of tmp at flux 24 25 l m2 h from the tmp values measured at the following time points measurements over a period of 15 min 2 8 extraction and analysis of smp and eps smp and eps fractions were extracted from the mixed liquor following the procedure outlined by hwang et al 2010 and banti et al 2017 with modification briefly 35 ml of the mixed liquor were collected from the mbr system aeration and membrane tanks and subsequently centrifuged at 4000 g for 5 min the supernatant was recovered with a pipette and filtered through a 0 45 μm millipore filter paper the resulting filtrate referred to as the smp fraction was then analyzed for its protein and polysaccharide content according to the methods developed by lowry et al 1951 and dubois et al 1956 respectively regarding eps extraction the pellet obtained after the centrifugation step was suspended in 35 ml of 0 05 w v nacl solution then heated at 60 c in a water bath for 30 min and finally centrifuged at 4000 g for 15 min the supernatant obtained referred to as the eps fraction was then analyzed for its protein and polysaccharide content as described above protein concentrations were calibrated with bovine serum albumin bsa sigma aldrich and polysaccharides with glucose panreac 2 9 chemical oxygen demand cod measurements cod values in influent and effluent samples were determined with standard test kits namely lck 514 100 2000 mg l o2 and lck 1414 5 60 mg l o2 respectively hach lange gmbh düsseldorf germany samples were digested at 148 οc for 2 h in a dry thermostat lt200 hach lange gmbh düsseldorf germany then cooled at 25 c and subsequently measured using a portable spectrophotometer dr 2800 hach lange gmbh düsseldorf germany 2 10 mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and volatile suspended solids mlvss concentrations of mlss and mlvss were determined according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 1999 2 11 microscopic observation of the community the morphology of the activated sludge s microbial community during the different operation periods was studied using light microscopy axio observer z1 zeiss berlin germany samples were placed on glass slides and microscopically observed with the cover slip on a zen microscope and imaging software was employed to process and analyze the images creating jpeg image files of the optical microscopic images 3 results 3 1 isolation of a novel strain degrading n acyl homoserine lactones an activated sludge sample was withdrawn from the mbr system treating municipal wastewater aiming at the isolation of a strain capable to degrade n acyl homoserine lactones four indigenous strains were isolated using the enrichment method described in the materials and methods section the strains were named sbr04ma sbr04mkg sbr04mkd and sbr04kbg the degradation of 50 μμ c6 hsl in 9 h was then investigated in order to justify the ability of the isolated strains to degrade n acyl homoserine lactones three out of the four strains showed the ability to degrade c6 hsl as shown in fig 2 however only the strain sbr04ma was capable to completely degrade 50 μμ c6 hsl in 9 h the particular strain shared 98 sequence identity with 16srrna sequences of lactobacillus plantarum thus hereinafter will be referred to as lactobacillus sp sbr04ma seq id kx812805 3 2 lactobacillus sp sbr04ma biofouling mitigation potential the aim of this work was to study the effect of qq strain on membrane biofouling critical flux was used as an indicator for the assessment of the potential of the certain strain for biofouling control as shown in fig s1 s2 supporting information and s3 the initial value of the critical flux before the addition of alginate beads in the mbr tanks was the same in both periods and specifically it was equal to 8 3 l m2 h however high differences were observed in critical flux in relation to operation time in the control and the qq period critical flux remained constant up to day 15 in the control period as illustrated in fig 3 and fig s1 supporting information in addition it was noticed that the beads started to deteriorate after day 7 due to crushing caused by the recirculation pump the alginate residues did not show any enhancement of system performance or a potential for biofouling prevention nevertheless during the performance of the critical flux run on day 15 it was observed that operating the mbr system at the highest flux 24 25 l m2 h resulted in a sharp increase of tmp to very high values and was attributed to the irreversible deposition of biopolymers inside the membrane pores fig s1 supporting information yamamura et al 2014 during the qq period the critical flux remained almost stable only in the first days of operation fig 3 fig s2 supporting information critical flux was 8 3 l m2 h and the majority of the beads were entrapped in the aeration tank while a fraction of the beads was transported to the membrane tank through recirculation however gradual deterioration of the alginate beads was observed similar to that of the control period resulting in a gradual release of lactobacillus sp sbr04ma cell population to the mixed liquor cell release affected membrane critical flux on day 9 specifically critical flux increased from 8 3 l m2 h to 12 25 l m2 h thereafter critical flux further increased and specifically on day 11 it showed a value of 17 5 l m2 h while on day 18 the critical flux was 20 75 l m2 h and on day 22 critical flux almost reached the highest flux studied 24 25 l m2 h therefore after the release of lactobacillus sp sbr04ma cells critical flux greatly increased and this was observed for extended operation time it seems that cell population was not reduced in relation with time but it retained a prolonged ability to affect the microflora of the mixed liquor and to prevent membrane fouling in order to elucidate the effect of qq mechanism on the membrane s performance the tmp difference δtmp during the 15 min critical flux run at the highest threshold flux 24 25 l m2 h was studied fig 4 for the 15th day of control period and the 18th day of qq period as well as the days before the addition of the alginate beads in each period day 0 for both periods as shown in fig 6 prior to the addition of alginate beads δtmp slightly increased as a result of the short operating time of the membrane and low biofouling rate however as operation time progressed biofouling resulted in pore blocking and rapid tmp increase at the highest flux of 24 25 l m2 h specifically on day 15 of control period δtmp exhibited a very high rate of increase reaching a maximum of 20 kpa after the 15 min critical flux run and this was attributed to potential irreversible deposition of biopolymers into the membrane pores however the addition of the strain resulted in biofouling prevention and δtmp was only slightly affected on day 18 of the qq period but still it was significantly lower when compared to the days before the addition of the alginate beads for both of the periods fig 4 fig s3 supporting information indicating an improvement of mixed liquor filtration characteristics 3 3 smp and eps concentration in the mixed liquor of the bioreactor the average concentrations of eps and smp in samples of the mixed liquor from the two tanks and the effluent were measured in the control and qq periods in order to evaluate the effect of qq on microflora activities and to identify the mechanism of fouling prevention the corresponding results are shown in figs 5 7 in the qq period the average concentrations of protein and polysaccharide fractions of smp and eps were lower in comparison to the control period about 50 reduction of the smp protein fraction was observed in both tanks during the qq period in comparison to the control period a in the aeration tank the average concentration of smp protein fraction was 5 7 mg g vss for the control period whereas in the qq period it was 2 49 mg g vss b in the membrane tank the average concentration of smp protein fraction was 4 8 mg g vss in the control period whereas in qq period it was 1 98 mg g vss about 20 30 reduction was also observed in eps protein fraction concentration during qq period in both tanks a in the aeration tank the eps protein fraction was 39 56 mg g vss in the control period whereas in the qq period the average eps protein concentration was 28 8 mg g vss b in the membrane tank the eps protein fraction was 36 13 mg g vss in the control period in comparison to the qq period where the average eps protein concentration was 25 22 mg g vss carbohydrate concentration of smp and eps in the mixed liquor of the two tanks was reduced by about 50 in the qq period in relation to the control period in the aeration tank average concentration of smp carbohydrate fraction was 3 41 mg g vss during the control period and 1 69 mg g vss for the qq period the average concentration of eps carbohydrate fraction was 16 4 mg g vss for the control period and 6 6 mg g vss for the qq period in the membrane tank the average concentration of smp carbohydrate fraction was 2 72 mg g vss for the control period and 1 47 mg g vss for the qq period the average concentration of eps carbohydrate fraction was 12 47 mg g vss for control period and 6 42 mg g vss for qq period in general lower average concentrations of smp and eps were observed in the mixed liquor of qq period indicating that qq enhances the mbr performance by affecting the production of biopolymers of sludge microflora to further confirm the inhibition of inside pore fouling the smp concentration of the effluent was measured in both periods fig 7 similar results as above were observed smp protein concentration in qq period was reduced by about 1 3 of the corresponding concentration in the control period nevertheless the concentration of carbohydrates in the effluent of the qq period was almost half the concentration of the effluent in the control period the above results indicated that the addition of lactobacillus sp sbr04ma affected the concentration of the inside pore foulants and therefore mitigated the pore fouling the reduction of eps that are excreted by the activated sludge microorganisms is associated with a change in the sludge biocommunity two types of bacterial species are typically found in the mixed liquor of an activated sludge system flocculant producing and filamentous species filamentous bacteria usually provide a scaffold for the other microflora microorganisms while the flocculant producing bacteria contribute to the formation of a biofilm matrix in the form of flocs as mentioned in the introduction section flocs and biofilms are composed of a matrix that is made from eps therefore the reduction of eps is expected to have an impact on the flocs in order to identify potential differences of the mbr microflora during the operation at the two periods mixed liquor samples were withdrawn and were analyzed by an optical microscope after the completion of the control period operation conditions were adjusted to favor the formation of a bulking sludge due to overgrowth of the filamentous population in the mixed liquor resulting to sludge foaming in order to observe and estimate the abundance of filamentous bacteria under abnormal sludge states various sludge samples were observed including the control period sludge abnormal bulking sludge and qq period sludge several differences were observed as shown in fig 8 a during the control period equilibrium was observed between the flocculant producing and filamentous bacteria providing a connective matrix b sample of bulking sludge showed the massive overpopulation of filamentous causing a fibrous entangled lattice that restricts the growth of other bacterial species c samples of qq period showed that the filamentous species prevailed over the flocculant producing nevertheless comparing the above sample with the control period sample and the bulking sludge sample the abundance of filamentous was attributed to the shrinkage of the flocculant producing bacterial matrix rather than to overpopulation of filamentous strains therefore it could be concluded that the reduction of eps concentration that were observed by analytical methods had an impact on the size and the abundance of flocs 3 4 mbr effluent cod characteristics the performance of cod removal of the mbr system for each period was also studied by determining the cod values of both influents and effluents the addition of the qq strain lactobacillus sp sbr04ma not only enhanced the operation of the membrane by preventing biofouling formation but also resulted to an effluent with an average cod value of 18 2 6 5 mg l the average cod value of the influent during the qq period was 737 141 7 mg l which was similar to that of the control period with an average cod value of 659 189 8 mg l the cod value of the effluent during the control period was 23 13 mg l therefore during the control period the cod removal was 96 5 while during the qq period the cod removal was 97 5 consequently cod removal rate and the performance of the bioreactor were not affected by the addition of lactobacillus sp mbr04ma in the system 4 discussion in this study the isolation of a novel qq strain from municipal wastewater sludge was achieved and its potential for biofouling prevention was evidenced by the increase in critical flux 3 fold increase and the reduction in the concentrations of smp and eps in mixed liquor the novel isolated strain belonged to the lactobacillus genus whose member has not been previously isolated from wastewater samples oh et al 2012 cheong et al 2013 strains that belong in the lactobacillus genus have been previously reported to have the ability to block the production of ahls rosenberger et al 2006 in addition the strains that have been isolated and utilized in similar studies belonged to the rhodococcus genus oh et al 2012 and pseudomonas genus cheong et al 2013 such strains may have low pathogenic ability however the novel strain which was identified in the present study belonged to the lactobacillus genus whose members are rarely pathogenic borriello et al 2003 in this study it was justified that quorum quenching significantly increased the critical flux value and therefore mitigated biofouling and improved the overall mbr performance these findings are in accordance with those presented in similar studies e g yeon et al 2009 lee et al 2014 oh et al 2012 maqbool et al 2015 confirming that quorum quenching is a promising method for biofouling prevention the use of alginate beads in the pilot scale mbr was not found to be very promising compared to a similar study where the life of beads is referred to be long about 45 days maqbool et al 2015 whereas in this study the beads started to break down in one week as they passed through the recycling peristaltic pump that transfer the mixed liquor between the two tanks of the experimental system generally the use of alginate beads as an immobilization medium may not be appropriate for commercial mbr applications to date the need of an encapsulation medium has limited the use of the qq strains while most of the studies have focused on the improvement of encapsulation media kim et al 2015 ergön can et al 2017 in the present study it was shown that the new isolated qq strain was potent to mitigate biofouling after the release and uniform distribution of the immobilized cells in the mixed liquor the alginate beads were trapped in the aeration tank where they deteriorated in a period of 7 days it is well established that quorum quenching is much less effective if the qq media are in a different tank jahangir et al 2012 however when the beads deteriorated an increase in the critical flux during the qq period was observed and therefore the isolated strain had a positive effect on mbr performance this improvement was observed after the disintegration of the beads where the bacterial cells were being released in the mixed liquor and distributed uniformly in the bioreactor the released cells were not outcompeted by the indigenous microbial community of the bioreactor since not only they retained the activity of biofouling control for days after the alginate beads degradation but continued to improve the mixed liquor characteristics by increasing the critical flux therefore the bacterial cells in the mixed liquor were capable of surviving and preserving their effect towards the mbr fouling without the presence of the immobilization medium since the functionality of the strain was not affected by the competition from the dominant bacteria of the activated sludge those results are in contrast with most of the related works where the corresponding strains required previous immobilization in appropriate media for their protection in the form of immobilization media against the competitive reactors biocommunity cheong et al 2013 2014 weerasekara et al 2014 kim et al 2015 maqbool et al 2015 ergön can et al 2017 lactobacillus sp sbr04ma proved a strong and effective organism without requirement for its prior encapsulation into an appropriate immobilization medium if it is possible to use the particular strain as a free cell suspension in the mixed liquor this method is going to be cost effective however further studies are required for clarification using municipal and industrial wastewater which may have micropollutants inhibiting the strain s survival rate and its qq activity muñoz et al 2008 the addition of the certain strain showed to minimize significantly the increase of δtmp at the highest flux of 24 25 l m2 h fig 4 figure s3 supporting information this is in agreement with the results of several previous works which showed that quorum quenching is reducing the δtmp increase rate cheong et al 2014 weerasekara et al 2014 kim et al 2015 maqbool et al 2015 when the membrane module was incorporated in the system a similar pressure drop increase was observed ranging from 0 to 3 kpa in 15 min however after 15 days of system operation at 8 3 l m2 h smp and eps conditioning on the membrane resulted in a sharp increase of δtmp however during the qq period insignificant increase of δtmp was measured even after the operation of the membrane for a long time exceeding 18 days as a result it is assumed that lactobacillus sp sbr04ma addition had not only mitigated biofouling but prevented the eps smp conditioning of the membrane surface due to long exposure to mixed liquor moreover several studies have investigated the effect of quorum quenching on mixed liquor eps and smp contents cheong et al 2014 maqbool et al 2015 specifically cheong et al 2014 showed that quorum quenching caused a slight reduction in smp and eps concentration levels whereas maqbool et al 2015 showed high reduction mainly in smp concentration the results of this work were consistent with these studies as it was observed that during the qq period the average smp and eps concentrations were lower in both protein and polysaccharide fractions which are the main foulants of the membrane the impact of eps reduction was also observed in mixed liquor flocs as in qq period their size was smaller than those observed in the control period altering the balance between flocculant and filamentous bacteria furthermore the concentration of smp in the effluent was investigated to confirm that the transfer of smp from the interior of the pores was reduced lower concentrations in both effluent carbohydrate and protein fractions were observed confirming that quorum quenching had also the ability to prevent the internal pore fouling in general quorum quenching significantly affected eps and smp production in mixed liquor nevertheless further studies are needed to clarify this kind of fouling prevention the reduction of eps and smp caused by the qq strain lactobacillus sp sbr04ma did not affect the cod removal rate providing an effluent with cod values lower than 25 mg l this result is in accordance with previous studies cheong et al 2013 2014 kim et al 2014 maqbool et al 2015 where different qq strains were used however further studies are necessary in order to verify the effect of qq strain on the overall reactor performance including nutrients removal yu et al 2018 and treatment of municipal or and industrial wastewater containing compounds persistent to microbial degradation heavy metals dyes antibiotic residues that may affect qq activity 5 conclusions membrane biofouling is the major drawback regarding the widespread application of membrane bioreactors for wastewater treatment to overcome problems associated with biofouling a novel qq bacterium namely lactobacillus sp sbr04ma was isolated from municipal wastewater sludge and its potential to mitigate biofouling was assessed according to the results the certain qq bacterium significantly increased the critical flux of the mbr system 3 fold increase by suppressing smp and eps production which are the main foulants of the membrane cod removal was not affected by the addition of the qq bacterium and average cod removal exceeded 97 overall the particular strain appears to be very promising for biofouling mitigation thus enhancing mbr s performance acknowledgments this research has been co financed by the european union european social fund

detaching the biofilm from biofilter grains and dispersing clusters into singles cells using tween 80 and sodium pyrophosphate combined with four steps of high energy sonication 27w for 80 s each step glutaraldehyde was shown to be the best fixative solution the developed protocol was reliable and highly reproducible and produced results that are comparable to data from alternative quantification methods indeed high correlations were found with trends obtained through atp and qpcr ρ 0 98 and ρ 0 91 measurements the vs content was confirmed as an inaccurate method to express biomass in sand

drinking water treatment plants whereby raw water is passed through a porous bed of filter medium in order to remove fine particles and soluble organic matter in addition to removing particles from the water stream sand and gac particles are an excellent support for the development of biofilms in fact highly diverse microbial communities have been found populating these systems pinto et al 2012 water biofilter functionality and performance under different conditions have been investigated and reported in several studies lechevallier et al 1992 liu et al 2001 moll et al 1999 more recently research has focused on understanding the composition of the complex microbial communities inhabiting water filters by employing molecular biology tools bai et al 2013 haig et al 2014 2015 palomo et al 2016 pinto et al 2015 white et al 2012 these studies have collected a considerable amount of phylogenetic and potential physiological information contributing to a better understanding of some of the ecological functions of these communities in drinking water systems gülay et al 2016 and their impact on the water in the distribution system pinto et al 2012 studying microbial diversity in water filters is an exciting new research direction but the accurate quantification of bacteria in these filters is equally important it is an often under appreciated complementary element of microbial ecology which is essential for determining bacterial growth rates and substrate utilisation kinetics for theoretical modelling meynet et al 2014 2012 mass balances vignola et al 2018 and for comprehensive interpretation of microbiome surveys props et al 2017 therefore the search for rapid and reliable techniques to estimate microbial cell numbers in diverse environments and in filter media specifically has become a scientific priority davis 2014 microbial quantification has traditionally been carried out using plating techniques which are characterised by long processing time and strong biases due to the fact that the majority of prokaryotes fail to grow on culture media staley and konopka 1985 epifluorescence microscopy efm was developed as a standardised method allowing direct microscopic counts of microbial cells stained with fluorescence dyes this method was successfully employed to count bacteria in freshwater jones 1979 marine water daley 1979 soil barra caracciolo et al 2005 elazhari ali et al 2013 riis et al 1998 and sediments samples amalfitano and fazi 2008 the main factors hampering the wider application of these methods for biomass quantification include the laborious and time consuming nature of the analytical procedure especially when working with solid matrices alternative approaches which allow for a quick and rapid direct estimation of biomass on biofilter media particles include i adenosine triphosphate atp quantification as proposed by velten et al 2007 and ii real time quantitative pcr qpcr gülay et al 2016 one of the most promising alternatives to traditional quantification methods to assess drinking water treatment plant dwtp performance which so far has mainly been applied to water samples consists of counting cells by flow cytometry fcm in combination with sensitive nucleic acid specific dyes fcm has become the method of choice for quantifying microbial cells in aquatic samples combining high sample throughput with speed and accuracy hammes et al 2008 van nevel et al 2017 moreover fcm has proved to be a useful tool not only for assessing cell abundance and viability but also for microbial community profiling berney et al 2008 prest et al 2014 2013 ramseier et al 2011 while fcm is widely used for water its application on samples such as sand particles sediment or soil is still limited due to difficulties and complications linked to working with biofilms attached to a solid matrix the presence of detritus minerals and extracellular polymeric substances eps can produce a high fluorescence background and interferes with cell counting kuwae and hosokawa 1999 in such environments cells are attached to particle surfaces and to each other through the eps cells need to be detached from the solid matrix transferred into a liquid matrix and separated from the eps structure into single cells in order to accurately quantify them using fcm a study from magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 developed a biofilm detachment protocol for filter media samples sand and gac quantifying the dispersed cells using atp measurements in the development of a biofilm detachment method for fcm applications it is not only crucial to obtain high yields of detached cells but also to ensure dispersal of flocs clusters into single cells while avoiding cells lysis cells are counted on the fcm only when they maintain structural integrity with either partially damaged or intact membranes berney et al 2007 while the presence of flocs can lead to underestimations cells grouped together are counted as one single event and pose a risk of blockage to the instrument a study from lavergne et al 2014 proposed a detachment protocol specifically optimised for its use in combination with fcm for coastal marine sediment samples to our knowledge no simple and standardised method has yet been developed for water filter sand samples thus this paper aims to optimise and critically describe a rapid fcm protocol to enumerate microbial cells present in biofilms attached to water filter media and to evaluate the protocol against other culture independent quantification approaches typically used for such samples namely atp qpcr and volatile solids vs 2 methods 2 1 samples collection samples were collected from two slow sand filters ssf and two rapid gravity filters rgf belonging to three different dwtps table 1 table si1 operated by northumbrian water ltd filters were fully drained overnight before sampling sand cores were extracted by means of a metal sediment corer allowing the sampling of the top top middle mid and bottom bot layers of the filter bed aliquots of sand were transferred into sterile 500 ml plastic containers transported to the lab at 4 c and stored in the dark at 4 c until use sample storage differed between the different optimisation experiments however in any cross comparison experiment each sample was analysed for all the four counting methods the same day in order to avoid discrepancies that may result from different storage times all the method optimisation experiments were performed using only one type of sand collected from the top layer of the ssfs in dwtp1 table 1 2 2 optimisation of biofilm detachment the method proposed by magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 was used as a starting point and optimised for its application with fcm analysis in order to improve the enumeration of microbial cells in sand samples the optimisation was performed through three main steps 1 the identification of a dispersant solution capable of enhancing the biofilm detachment and its dispersal into single cells 2 the evaluation of different mechanical treatments low and high energy sonication shaking to be combined with the identified dispersant 3 the identification of a suitable fixative method to protect cells from lysis during the developed detachment treatment cells were extracted from 2 g of wet sand sample dwtp1 5 sampled as described in 2 2 submerged in 50 ml of an extraction solution and subjected to one cycle of low energy sonication les using a sonicating water bath decon fs200b 120w 40 khz for 3 min followed by different cycles according to the optimisation experiment of high energy sonication hes using an ultrasonic probe cole parmer instrument ultrasonic processor with a power input of 27w for 80 s at each step fresh extraction solution different solutions were tested according to the experiment was added at each treatment step while the sonicated solution was transferred into autoclaved 500 ml duran bottles 2 ml aliquots of the extraction solution at each treatment step were collected along with aliquots of the final cumulative solution transferred into sterile falcon tubes and fixed with a solution of glutaraldehyde 1 v v at a ratio of 1 1 v v after fixation samples were stored in the dark at 4 c and analysed within 2 days with fcm to obtain total and intact cell concentrations see below the total number of cells extracted from 2 g wet weight ww of sand was expressed as the sum of the cells recovered at each step replicate extractions were performed and each extraction was analysed in duplicate

one cycle of les and two cycles of hes autoclaved tap water 120 c 15 min tap magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 was used as a control solution against which the recovery of cells from biofilm was expressed the cumulative recovery of cells at each treatment step was expressed as the number of cells extracted with the specific extraction solution compared to the total amount of cells extracted

treatment on cell detachment was tested by subjecting sand samples immersed in the chosen dispersant to one cycle of les and seven cycles of hes section 2 1 a control with autoclaved tap water was extracted in the same way the effect of mechanical shaking compared to sonication was also tested using an orbital shaker wet sand 2 g sample dwtp1 5 table 1 was subjected to four cycles of shaking on an orbital shaker 250 rpm for 30 min fresh extraction solution was added at each treatment step while the exhausted solution was transferred to sterile containers aliquots of the extraction solution were withdrawn at each treatment step straight after the solution addition t0 and after each shaking cycle t1 to t4 after collection samples were fixed and stored for fcm analyses as previously described during the same experiment 2 g ww of the sand from the same sample dwtp1 5 was subjected to four cycles of hes samples of the extraction solutions were collected at each cycle of sonication treated and analysed as previously described in order to compare the extraction efficiency of the two mechanical methods sonication versus shaking at each step for both methods a dispersant was used as an extraction solution and autoclaved tap water was used as a control 2 2 1 3 fixative optimisation two fixative solutions were tested 1 a solution of glutaraldehyde 1 v v in di water glut fixed

deactivated as described in velten et al 2007 and heated for at least 10 min in a heating block 30 c simultaneously 300 μl of bactiter glo promega madison wi usa was transferred to a separate sterile

u s epa 2001 2 4 flow cytometric measurements fcm total and intact cell concentration tcc icc measurements on the extraction solution samples were performed using a facscan flow cytometer becton

controls consisting of the extraction solutions without sand addition which were treated following the sample extraction procedures were analysed for each fcm run and the values were subtracted from the final fcm measurements 2 5 statistical analyses all statistical analyses were performed using minitab and r software the effect of the different dispersants and the different mechanical treatments

models were used to detect significant differences among the protocol developed fcm and the other three methods tested atp qpcr vs a pearson product moment correlation coefficient ρ was calculated to determine the relationship between fcm counts with either atp or qpcr counts or vs content 3 results 3 1 chemical treatment dispersants the highest recovery was obtained with the solution of tween pp where after one cycle of low energy sonication les and two cycles of high energy sonication hes 24 1 more cells were extracted compared to tap paired t test p 0 05 fig 1 a no statistical difference was observed among the recoveries of the nacl2 cacl2 and pp solutions the number of cells extracted with triton x100 was significantly lower paired t test p 0 05 than the controls 52 8 of the control three main extraction patterns were observed tween pp triggered the release of the majority of cells immediately after its addition to the samples with a second increase after the first hes treatment fig 1b autoclaved tap water seemed to release cells in two distinct phases half of the cells were released in the first two steps 53 of cells released during addition and les 40 were released in the hes1 the rest of the dispersants showed a constant linear release throughout the four treatment steps average 25 removal at each step with no treatment showing more extraction efficiency than the others 3 2 mechanical treatment sonication steps and shaking having established that the solution of tween pp was the most effective dispersant an experiment was performed in order to find the minimum number of sonication treatments able to ensure a satisfactory removal of biomass from sand particles samples treated with tween pp displayed a significantly higher number of total extracted cells tec compared to autoclaved tap water the highest amount of cells was extracted in both sets of samples after the addition of the extraction solution t0 and in the first hes treatment fig 2 the treatment effectiveness attenuated after the hes1 in both the tap water and dispersant treated samples fig 2 in tween pp treated samples no statistically significant difference was observed between the total amount of cells extracted at the end of the whole treatment and the one measured at hes2 one way t test p 0 057 in samples extracted with tap water the plateau seemed to be reached later the increment given by each consecutive hes step was statistically insignificant after hes3 one way t test p 0 08 the effect of shaking was also tested and compared to sonication fig 3 the combination of tween pp with hes was the most effective method among the four tested the amount of cells extracted using tween pp with sonication was significantly higher than those extracted by the other three methods anova p 0 05 the worst performing treatment was the tap water combined with shaking while the difference between tween pp with shaking and tap water with sonication was statistically insignificant t test p 0 22 as previously observed the highest amount of cells was recovered at hes0 after the dispersant addition and after the first cycle of hes and the recovery efficiency of the treatment also attenuated after the first cycle of hes fig 3 the number of cells extracted in shaken samples was significantly higher for the tween pp solution than for tap water paired t test p 0 01 the highest number of cells was detached in the first two steps of treatment t0 and t1 the removal efficiency dropped drastically after the first two steps in both solutions 3 3 fixative optimisation the tec from glutaraldehyde fixed samples glut fixed was significantly higher than the tec from ethanol fixed etoh fixed samples and from the pbs control anova p 0 001 when tween pp was employed as an extraction solution fig 4 no statistically significant difference was observed between the etoh fixed samples and the pbs control anova p 0 05 the same pattern was observed when autoclaved tap water was employed as the extraction solution the tec from the glut fixed samples was significantly higher than the amount extracted from the etoh fixed samples and the pbs control anova p 0 01 no statistically significant difference was observed between the etoh fixed and the control samples anova p 0 05 the tec with tween pp solution was significantly higher than the number of cells extracted by autoclaved tap water in all the samples glut and etoh fixed and pbs control confirming that tween pp is more effective as an extraction solution t test p 0 05 fig 4a the number of intact cells was also measured during this experiment contrary to what was observed with the total cells the number of intact cells extracted by using autoclaved tap water was for all the samples etoh fixed glut fixed and pbs control significantly higher than the amount extracted when using tween pp t test p 0 05 fig 4b among the samples extracted with tween pp no statistically significant difference was observed between the intact cells measured in glut fixed samples and the pbs control anova p 0 05 on the other hand the number of intact cells extracted from the etoh fixed samples was two orders of magnitude lower than that extracted from the other two sets of samples fig 4b 3 4 protocol cross comparison with other biomass quantification methods all the assessments above resulted in a final protocol that seemed to detach biofilm formed on the surface of and between sand grains satisfactorily and effectively and dispersed the biofilm fig si1 from such samples allowing microbial cells to be counted using fcm fig 5 however the biofilm still attached on sand grains was not quantified in this study ten sand samples collected from several water filters were tested by quantifying cell counts with the developed protocol which were compared with those of other commonly used techniques for cell biomass quantification see fig 6 1 aliquots of sand samples 2g in duplicate were fixed with a glutaraldehyde solution 1 v v for 30 min at room temperature 1 1 ml of fixative solution to gww of sand straight after fixation cells were extracted via four steps of hes performed with a sonication probe 80 s 27 w a combination of sodiumpyrophosphate 10 mm tween 80 5 was employed as an extraction solution fresh solution 50 ml was added to sand after each treatment step while the exhausted solution was transferred into a sterile glass container 2 aliquots of the cumulative solutions were collected fixed in a solution of glutaraldehyde 1 v v 1 1 v v fixative solution sample stored in the dark at 4 c and analysed by fcm within two days 3 controls of dried 105 c overnight and incinerated 550 c 1h sand were extracted for each sample tested following the same protocol and analysed by fcm in order to distinguish background noise created by organic and inorganic particles indeed each sand sample showed unique background fluorescence signals created by particle autofluorescence controls were vital to design tailored settings of the electronic gate in order to get comparable results among the four quantification methods each sample was analysed for every single method within the same day fcm estimates of cell abundances were always lower than those given by atp and qpcr by an average factor of 0 70 0 05 and 0 09 0 01 respectively however despite differences in absolute numbers cells abundances assessed by fcm were significantly correlated with those obtained with atp p 0 01 pearson s ρ 0 98 and qpcr p 0 01 ρ 0 911 highly significant correlations were also found between atp and qpcr abundances p 0 01 ρ 0 93 table 2 very low correlations were found between all three methods and quantification of biomass using volatile solids vs 4 discussion in this study we present a flow cytometric method specifically optimised for enumerating cells present on the surface of sand particles used in water filters this method constitutes a considerable improvement on previously developed protocols for biomass quantification on sand samples from water biofilters magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 the protocol developed allows direct cell quantification free from potential biases introduced by assumptions such as equal average atp content per cell frossard et al 2016 and overcomes the limitations associated with qpcr quantification methods such as dna extraction efficiency and yield bremen et al 1999 feinstein et al 2009 and primer specificity we optimised cell detachment for fcm quantification using a combination of chemical surfactants and ionic dispersants together with low and high energy sonication as a mechanical pre treatment and different fixative methods furthermore we cross compared the developed protocol against other established and commonly employed methods for biomass quantification for water filter samples 4 1 optimisation of pre treatments for biofilm detachment chemical treatment the combination of a surfactant tween 80 with an ionic dispersant sodium pyrophosphate created the best conditions for the detachment of biofilm from particle surfaces and their dispersal into single cells allowing the highest counts in flow cytometric analyses the surfactant triton x100 detached significantly fewer cells than all the other solutions tested in contrast with previous studies chen and stewart 2000 different dispersants have previously been studied to enhance the detachment of cell agglomerates and biofilms from surfaces in an experiment conducted by chen and stewart 2000 solutions of nacl cacl2 and triton x100 performed best in removing biofilm from stainless steel slides magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 successfully employed autoclaved tap water in combination with several sonication steps for the detachment of biofilm from sand and gac particles as evaluated by atp quantification while brown et al 2015 and lavergne et al 2014 showed that the combination of a non ionic surfactant tween 80 and an ionic dispersant was the best performing solution to disperse activated sludge flocs and detach biofilm from coastal sediments we observed no significant differences in the number of total extractable cells from sand samples treated with autoclaved tap water nacl cacl2 and pp solutions the five dispersants used clustered according to three different extraction patterns similar to those previously observed by ugolini et al 2013 where a tween mix 1 tween 80 in 0 1 m edta and 0 1m tspp 2 2 tetrasodium pyrophosphate decahydrate was tested among other dispersants to detach biofilm from freshwater sediment columns the solution released the majority of cells shortly after application followed by drastic rapid attenuation of its extraction efficiency ugolini et al 2013 also observed that solutions of nacl and cacl2 showed a slower and more prolonged response similar to that described in this paper ugolini et al 2013 each of the solutions employed in this study promotes biofilm detachment and dispersal through different mechanisms non ionic surfactants such as tween 80 and triton x 100 act by disrupting hydrophobic interactions involved in cross linking the biofilm matrix this triggers the solubilisation of hydrophobic molecules that constitute the biofilms extracellular polymeric substances eps such as extracellular lipids which play an important role in biofilm adhesion chen and stewart 2000 such an effect would explain the high numbers of cells extracted at t0 by the tween pp dispersant however it is still not clear why in this experiment a completely different behaviour and a significantly lower extraction efficiency was observed for triton x 100 the increased extraction efficiency of tween pp might be explained by the fact that when the two dispersants are combined they may act through two different mechanisms tween dissolves hydrophobic molecules as described above and pp acts as a chelating agent scavenging bivalent cations such as ca2 and mg2 that crosslink the negatively charged groups on the surface of eps constituents ugolini et al 2013 velji and albright 1984 mechanical treatment we found that four cycles of high energy sonication in a tween pp solution are the most effective treatment for optimal cell counts among all the treatments tested sonication is a mechanical treatment often proposed for the removal of biofilm from a plastic material proctor et al 2016 sand and gac particles li et al 2010 magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 and marine sediments danovaro et al 2001 low energy sonication has been shown to be less effective than high energy sonication in detaching biofilm from gac and sand particles a finding that has been confirmed by our results magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 in our experiment we subjected sand particles to one cycle of les followed by seven cycles of hes we observed no significant difference between the number of cells extracted after the addition of the extraction solution tween pp or tap and after one cycle of les in both sets of samples the cumulative atp yield of the biomass that magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 obtained in their experiment using les treatment on sand samples was 50 of the biomass obtained with hes at power input comparable to the one employed in our experiment 27 w hes treatment showed a quick and drastic decrease in its extraction efficiency reaching a plateau already after one hes cycle for tween pp or after two hes for tap confirming a trend already observed by magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 however in order to ensure maximum reproducibility and to obtain comparable results we suggest a minimum of four hes cycles run for up to 80 s at a power input of 27 w shaking was also evaluated as a mechanical pre treatment of sand particles as an alternative to sonication results suggested that the combination of chemical dispersant tween pp and hes was still the treatment ensuring the highest number of cells extracted however the combination of tween pp with four cycles of shaking allowed the final recovery of the same amount of cells obtained by the combination of autoclaved tap water and hes this kind of treatment might be useful when hes cannot be applied fixative optimisation two common fixation solutions were evaluated for their ability to preserve and protect microbial cells during the extraction protocol proposed glutaraldehyde and a solution of ethanol pbs 50 the results strongly suggested that the fixation methods could affect the extraction performance and the number of both intact and total microbial cells recovered by the treatment the number of total cells extracted from glut fixed samples was significantly greater than the amount extracted from etoh fixed and pbs control samples for both extraction solutions used tween pp and tap water section 3 3 solutions of detergents such as tween 20 or triton x100 are often used to allow the permeabilisation of cell membranes in order to gain access to intracellular areas they act by breaking lipid lipid and lipid protein interactions causing the solubilisation of lipids forming the cell membrane two main fixation methods can be identified in the literature to protect cells additive and denaturing fixations chao and zhang 2011 st laurent et al 2006 glutaraldehyde along with other aldehydes such as formaldehyde and paraformaldehyde belongs to the group of additive fixative solutions these solutions fix cells through the formation of covalent chemical bonds between the proteins of the cellular membrane the effect is the creation of an outer cell cross link structure this might explain the significantly higher amount of cells detected in the glut fixed samples extracted with tween pp compared to the controls the detergent enhances the biofilm breakage through the dissolution of the eps lipids but at the same time dissolves lipids of the cellular membrane this induces cells to burst unless they are protected by the outer cross link structure between membrane proteins created by the additive fixative solutions moreover the outer cross linked structure created by glutaraldehyde bonds proved to be an effective strategy for protecting cells from the shear forces created by sonication preventing both their burst and their damage in fact the amount of both total and intact cells extracted from glut fixed samples was significantly higher than that recovered in the control samples when autoclaved tap water was used as an extraction solution glutaraldehyde however was not able to protect cells from damage due to the dissolution of the lipid membrane the number of intact cells measured in glut fixed samples extracted with tween pp was one order of magnitude lower than the amount measured in the same set of samples extracted with autoclaved tap water this suggests that while the outer structure of cells remains intact allowing the count of total cells using fcm pores created in the cell membrane by lipid dissolution caused the double positively charged molecule of the propidium iodide pi stain to penetrate and stain the cells with a stronger red fluorescence in this way the pi positive cells with damaged membranes can clearly be distinguished from intact cells during fcm analyses ramseier et al 2011 ethanol proved to be an ineffective fixative failing to protect cells against burst or damage induced by chemical dissolution of the membrane or by shear forces created by sonication in fact no statistical difference was observed between the number of total cells measured in the etoh fixed samples and controls extracted with both solutions moreover we observed that ethanol dramatically damaged the cellular membrane the number of intact cells measured in etoh fixed samples was significantly lower than the controls for both extraction solutions ethanol belongs to the denaturating fixative solutions group these solutions act by denaturing proteins through the reduction of their solubility and or disruption of hydrophobic interactions their application could induce the dissolution of cell membrane lipids with the formation of large pores in its structure therefore explaining the low counts obtained 4 2 cross comparison with other methods the protocol proposed appeared to be a consistent and reliable method for measuring microbial cells in sand samples from water filters using fcm despite differences in the absolute numbers the cell abundances measured with the protocol correlated highly with the values obtained with other classic methods employed for biomass quantification for these environments qpcr and atp analysis the absolute counts obtained with the fcm method were typically lower than the corresponding counts obtained with the atp assay and with qpcr as suggested by the slope of the linear correlations 0 7 and 0 09 respectively a previous study carried out on samples collected from several environments sediments soils and sludge directly compared cell abundances measured via the atp assay and fcm on suspensions obtained after cell detachment via three cycles of sonication in a fixative solution frossard et al 2016 the study showed that estimates based on the atp assay yielded significantly higher average microbial abundances than the fcm method the slope of the correlation between fcm and atp was on average 0 36 in that study researchers attributed the discrepancy to the different storage times 4 weeks for fcm against the 24h for atp and preservation methods paraformaldehyde for fcm and phosphate buffer for atp employed by the two protocols the much higher slope observed in our study 0 7 rather than 0 36 might be explained by the fact that the four different methods were performed on every single sample on the same day of collection overcoming in this way biases induced by different preservation strategies and time the fcm estimated slightly lower cell abundances than the atp assay this discrepancy could be attributed to the measurement of extracellular atp or additional non microbial atp belonging to other microorganisms such as fungi or micro invertebrates as well as fine roots and small plant residues that are not quantified in the fcm method other potential causes are an underestimation of the average atp content per cell and uncertainty in the determination of the slope from the data on the other hand the high discrepancy between qpcr and fcm absolute numbers could result from problems of non specificity of the qpcr primers used or from the presence of free dna from decayed cells causing qpcr to overestimate the number of cells present in a sample alternatively another reason for the high discrepancies in counts observed between the method proposed and the other two analysed could be an incomplete removal of biofilm from the sand grain surfaces a qualitative analysis of the sand grains before and after the detachment protocol using optical microscopy fig 1 si showed effective detachment of biofilm however while the method seems to effectively detach most of the biofilm developed on the surfaces and between sand grains where we expect most of the cells to be located an unknown percentage of undetached biofilm or individual cells might still be present in crevices within sand particles finally vs had much weaker correlations pearson correlation ranging from 0 001 to 0 19 as compared with all other measures of biomass concentration this is not surprising as vs includes organic matter other than cells such as the organic matter naturally present in water and coagulated during the water treatment process it is important to underline that the method here proposed has been optimised using only one type of sand factors such as different filter media gac versus sand filter media characteristics grain dimension and roughness biofilm age and composition might affect the extraction efficiency while the protocol shows good reproducibility comparable with other common methods for the quantification of cell abundances in sand samples we suggest that additional experiments should be performed to check the reproducibility of the protocol and its efficacy on samples with characteristics different from those investigated in this study 5 conclusions the results show that the optimised protocol presented is a reliable and highly reproducible method for enumerating total cells on sand particles the protocol proposed using fcm for cell quantification produces cell abundances that correlate well with alternative quantification methods high correlations were found with counts obtained with atp and qpcr the vs content was confirmed as an inaccurate method to express biomass in sand samples despite a good correlation between the trends of cell abundances qpcr seems to overestimate absolute cell

19414,rapid quantification of absolute microbial cell abundances is important for a comprehensive interpretation of microbiome surveys and crucial to support theoretical modelling and the design of engineered systems in this paper we propose a protocol specifically optimised for the quantification of microbial abundances in water biofilters using flow cytometry fcm we optimised cell detachment from sand biofilter particles for fcm quantification through the evaluation of five chemical dispersants nacl triton x100 cacl2 sodium pyrophosphate pp tween 80 combined with pp different mechanical pre treatments low and high energy sonication and shaking and two fixation methods glutaraldehyde and ethanol the developed protocol was cross compared using other established and commonly employed methods for biomass quantification in water filter samples adenosine triphosphate atp quantification real time quantitative pcr qpcr and volatile solids vs the highest microbial count was obtained by detaching the biofilm from biofilter grains and dispersing clusters into singles cells using tween 80 and sodium pyrophosphate combined with four steps of high energy sonication 27w for 80 s each step glutaraldehyde was shown to be the best fixative solution the developed protocol was reliable and highly reproducible and produced results that are comparable to data from alternative quantification methods indeed high correlations were found with trends obtained through atp and qpcr ρ 0 98 and ρ 0 91 measurements the vs content was confirmed as an inaccurate method to express biomass in sand samples since it correlated poorly with all the other three methods ρ 0 005 with fcm 0 002 with atp and 0 177 with qpcr fcm and atp showed the strongest agreement between absolute counts with a slope of the correlation equal to 0 7 while qpcr seemed to overestimate cell counts by a factor of ten the rapidity and reproducibility of the method developed make its application ideal for routine quantification of microbial cell abundances on sand from water biofilters and thus useful in revealing the ecological patterns and quantifying the metabolic kinetics involved in such systems graphical

drinking water treatment plants whereby raw water is passed through a porous bed of filter medium in order to remove fine particles and soluble organic matter in addition to removing particles from the water stream sand and gac particles are an excellent support for the development of biofilms in fact highly diverse microbial communities have been found populating these systems pinto et al 2012 water biofilter functionality and performance under different conditions have been investigated and reported in several studies lechevallier et al 1992 liu et al 2001 moll et al 1999 more recently research has focused on understanding the composition of the complex microbial communities inhabiting water filters by employing molecular biology tools bai et al 2013 haig et al 2014 2015 palomo et al 2016 pinto et al 2015 white et al 2012 these studies have collected a considerable amount of phylogenetic and potential physiological information contributing to a better understanding of some of the ecological functions of these communities in drinking water systems gülay et al 2016 and their impact on the water in the distribution system pinto et al 2012 studying microbial diversity in water filters is an exciting new research direction but the accurate quantification of bacteria in these filters is equally important it is an often under appreciated complementary element of microbial ecology which is essential for determining bacterial growth rates and substrate utilisation kinetics for theoretical modelling meynet et al 2014 2012 mass balances vignola et al 2018 and for comprehensive interpretation of microbiome surveys props et al 2017 therefore the search for rapid and reliable techniques to estimate microbial cell numbers in diverse environments and in filter media specifically has become a scientific priority davis 2014 microbial quantification has traditionally been carried out using plating techniques which are characterised by long processing time and strong biases due to the fact that the majority of prokaryotes fail to grow on culture media staley and konopka 1985 epifluorescence microscopy efm was developed as a standardised method allowing direct microscopic counts of microbial cells stained with fluorescence dyes this method was successfully employed to count bacteria in freshwater jones 1979 marine water daley 1979 soil barra caracciolo et al 2005 elazhari ali et al 2013 riis et al 1998 and sediments samples amalfitano and fazi 2008 the main factors hampering the wider application of these methods for biomass quantification include the laborious and time consuming nature of the analytical procedure especially when working with solid matrices alternative approaches which allow for a quick and rapid direct estimation of biomass on biofilter media particles include i adenosine triphosphate atp quantification as proposed by velten et al 2007 and ii real time quantitative pcr qpcr gülay et al 2016 one of the most promising alternatives to traditional quantification methods to assess drinking water treatment plant dwtp performance which so far has mainly been applied to water samples consists of counting cells by flow cytometry fcm in combination with sensitive nucleic acid specific dyes fcm has become the method of choice for quantifying microbial cells in aquatic samples combining high sample throughput with speed and accuracy hammes et al 2008 van nevel et al 2017 moreover fcm has proved to be a useful tool not only for assessing cell abundance and viability but also for microbial community profiling berney et al 2008 prest et al 2014 2013 ramseier et al 2011 while fcm is widely used for water its application on samples such as sand particles sediment or soil is still limited due to difficulties and complications linked to working with biofilms attached to a solid matrix the presence of detritus minerals and extracellular polymeric substances eps can produce a high fluorescence background and interferes with cell counting kuwae and hosokawa 1999 in such environments cells are attached to particle surfaces and to each other through the eps cells need to be detached from the solid matrix transferred into a liquid matrix and separated from the eps structure into single cells in order to accurately quantify them using fcm a study from magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 developed a biofilm detachment protocol for filter media samples sand and gac quantifying the dispersed cells using atp measurements in the development of a biofilm detachment method for fcm applications it is not only crucial to obtain high yields of detached cells but also to ensure dispersal of flocs clusters into single cells while avoiding cells lysis cells are counted on the fcm only when they maintain structural integrity with either partially damaged or intact membranes berney et al 2007 while the presence of flocs can lead to underestimations cells grouped together are counted as one single event and pose a risk of blockage to the instrument a study from lavergne et al 2014 proposed a detachment protocol specifically optimised for its use in combination with fcm for coastal marine sediment samples to our knowledge no simple and standardised method has yet been developed for water filter sand samples thus this paper aims to optimise and critically describe a rapid fcm protocol to enumerate microbial cells present in biofilms attached to water filter media and to evaluate the protocol against other culture independent quantification approaches typically used for such samples namely atp qpcr and volatile solids vs 2 methods 2 1 samples collection samples were collected from two slow sand filters ssf and two rapid gravity filters rgf belonging to three different dwtps table 1 table si1 operated by northumbrian water ltd filters were fully drained overnight before sampling sand cores were extracted by means of a metal sediment corer allowing the sampling of the top top middle mid and bottom bot layers of the filter bed aliquots of sand were transferred into sterile 500 ml plastic containers transported to the lab at 4 c and stored in the dark at 4 c until use sample storage differed between the different optimisation experiments however in any cross comparison experiment each sample was analysed for all the four counting methods the same day in order to avoid discrepancies that may result from different storage times all the method optimisation experiments were performed using only one type of sand collected from the top layer of the ssfs in dwtp1 table 1 2 2 optimisation of biofilm detachment the method proposed by magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 was used as a starting point and optimised for its application with fcm analysis in order to improve the enumeration of microbial cells in sand samples the optimisation was performed through three main steps 1 the identification of a dispersant solution capable of enhancing the biofilm detachment and its dispersal into single cells 2 the evaluation of different mechanical treatments low and high energy sonication shaking to be combined with the identified dispersant 3 the identification of a suitable fixative method to protect cells from lysis during the developed detachment treatment cells were extracted from 2 g of wet sand sample dwtp1 5 sampled as described in 2 2 submerged in 50 ml of an extraction solution and subjected to one cycle of low energy sonication les using a sonicating water bath decon fs200b 120w 40 khz for 3 min followed by different cycles according to the optimisation experiment of high energy sonication hes using an ultrasonic probe cole parmer instrument ultrasonic processor with a power input of 27w for 80 s at each step fresh extraction solution different solutions were tested according to the experiment was added at each treatment step while the sonicated solution was transferred into autoclaved 500 ml duran bottles 2 ml aliquots of the extraction solution at each treatment step were collected along with aliquots of the final cumulative solution transferred into sterile falcon tubes and fixed with a solution of glutaraldehyde 1 v v at a ratio of 1 1 v v after fixation samples were stored in the dark at 4 c and analysed within 2 days with fcm to obtain total and intact cell concentrations see below the total number of cells extracted from 2 g wet weight ww of sand was expressed as the sum of the cells recovered at each step replicate extractions were performed and each extraction was analysed in duplicate

one cycle of les and two cycles of hes autoclaved tap water 120 c 15 min tap magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 was used as a control solution against which the recovery of cells from biofilm was expressed the cumulative recovery of cells at each treatment step was expressed as the number of cells extracted with the specific extraction solution compared to the total amount of cells extracted

treatment on cell detachment was tested by subjecting sand samples immersed in the chosen dispersant to one cycle of les and seven cycles of hes section 2 1 a control with autoclaved tap water was extracted in the same way the effect of mechanical shaking compared to sonication was also tested using an orbital shaker wet sand 2 g sample dwtp1 5 table 1 was subjected to four cycles of shaking on an orbital shaker 250 rpm for 30 min fresh extraction solution was added at each treatment step while the exhausted solution was transferred to sterile containers aliquots of the extraction solution were withdrawn at each treatment step straight after the solution addition t0 and after each shaking cycle t1 to t4 after collection samples were fixed and stored for fcm analyses as previously described during the same experiment 2 g ww of the sand from the same sample dwtp1 5 was subjected to four cycles of hes samples of the extraction solutions were collected at each cycle of sonication treated and analysed as previously described in order to compare the extraction efficiency of the two mechanical methods sonication versus shaking at each step for both methods a dispersant was used as an extraction solution and autoclaved tap water was used as a control 2 2 1 3 fixative optimisation two fixative solutions were tested 1 a solution of glutaraldehyde 1 v v in di water glut fixed

compared with three other biomass quantification methods qpcr atp quantification and vs content samples were collected as described in section 2 1 atp atp was measured as described in velten et al 2007 with a few minor modifications briefly 200 mg ww of sand particles were transferred into sterile 2 ml sterile reaction tubes together with 100 μl of phosphate buffer where atp was previously deactivated as described in velten et al 2007 and heated for at least 10 min in a heating block 30 c simultaneously 300 μl of bactiter glo promega madison wi usa was transferred to a separate sterile

controls consisting of the extraction solutions without sand addition which were treated following the sample extraction procedures were analysed for each fcm run and the values were subtracted from the final fcm measurements 2 5 statistical analyses all statistical analyses were performed using minitab and r software the effect of the different dispersants and the different mechanical treatments

models were used to detect significant differences among the protocol developed fcm and the other three methods tested atp qpcr vs a pearson product moment correlation coefficient ρ was calculated to determine the relationship between fcm counts with either atp or qpcr counts or vs content 3 results 3 1 chemical treatment dispersants the highest recovery was obtained with the solution of tween pp where after one cycle of low energy sonication les and two cycles of high energy sonication hes 24 1 more cells were extracted compared to tap paired t test p 0 05 fig 1 a no statistical difference was observed among the recoveries of the nacl2 cacl2 and pp solutions the number of cells extracted with triton x100 was significantly lower paired t test p 0 05 than the controls 52 8 of the control three main extraction patterns were observed tween pp triggered the release of the majority of cells immediately after its addition to the samples with a second increase after the first hes treatment fig 1b autoclaved tap water seemed to release cells in two distinct phases half of the cells were released in the first two steps 53 of cells released during addition and les 40 were released in the hes1 the rest of the dispersants showed a constant linear release throughout the four treatment steps average 25 removal at each step with no treatment showing more extraction efficiency than the others 3 2 mechanical treatment sonication steps and shaking having established that the solution of tween pp was the most effective dispersant an experiment was performed in order to find the minimum number of sonication treatments able to ensure a satisfactory removal of biomass from sand particles samples treated with tween pp displayed a significantly higher number of total extracted cells tec compared to autoclaved tap water the highest amount of cells was extracted in both sets of samples after the addition of the extraction solution t0 and in the first hes treatment fig 2 the treatment effectiveness attenuated after the hes1 in both the tap water and dispersant treated samples fig 2 in tween pp treated samples no statistically significant difference was observed between the total amount of cells extracted at the end of the whole treatment and the one measured at hes2 one way t test p 0 057 in samples extracted with tap water the plateau seemed to be reached later the increment given by each consecutive hes step was statistically insignificant after hes3 one way t test p 0 08 the effect of shaking was also tested and compared to sonication fig 3 the combination of tween pp with hes was the most effective method among the four tested the amount of cells extracted using tween pp with sonication was significantly higher than those extracted by the other three methods anova p 0 05 the worst performing treatment was the tap water combined with shaking while the difference between tween pp with shaking and tap water with sonication was statistically insignificant t test p 0 22 as previously observed the highest amount of cells was recovered at hes0 after the dispersant addition and after the first cycle of hes and the recovery efficiency of the treatment also attenuated after the first cycle of hes fig 3 the number of cells extracted in shaken samples was significantly higher for the tween pp solution than for tap water paired t test p 0 01 the highest number of cells was detached in the first two steps of treatment t0 and t1 the removal efficiency dropped drastically after the first two steps in both solutions 3 3 fixative optimisation the tec from glutaraldehyde fixed samples glut fixed was significantly higher than the tec from ethanol fixed etoh fixed samples and from the pbs control anova p 0 001 when tween pp was employed as an extraction solution fig 4 no statistically significant difference was observed between the etoh fixed samples and the pbs control anova p 0 05 the same pattern was observed when autoclaved tap water was employed as the extraction solution the tec from the glut fixed samples was significantly higher than the amount extracted from the etoh fixed samples and the pbs control anova p 0 01 no statistically significant difference was observed between the etoh fixed and the control samples anova p 0 05 the tec with tween pp solution was significantly higher than the number of cells extracted by autoclaved tap water in all the samples glut and etoh fixed and pbs control confirming that tween pp is more effective as an extraction solution t test p 0 05 fig 4a the number of intact cells was also measured during this experiment contrary to what was observed with the total cells the number of intact cells extracted by using autoclaved tap water was for all the samples etoh fixed glut fixed and pbs control significantly higher than the amount extracted when using tween pp t test p 0 05 fig 4b among the samples extracted with tween pp no statistically significant difference was observed between the intact cells measured in glut fixed samples and the pbs control anova p 0 05 on the other hand the number of intact cells extracted from the etoh fixed samples was two orders of magnitude lower than that extracted from the other two sets of samples fig 4b 3 4 protocol cross comparison with other biomass quantification methods all the assessments above resulted in a final protocol that seemed to detach biofilm formed on the surface of and between sand grains satisfactorily and effectively and dispersed the biofilm fig si1 from such samples allowing microbial cells to be counted using fcm fig 5 however the biofilm still attached on sand grains was not quantified in this study ten sand samples collected from several water filters were tested by quantifying cell counts with the developed protocol which were compared with those of other commonly used techniques for cell biomass quantification see fig 6 1 aliquots of sand samples 2g in duplicate were fixed with a glutaraldehyde solution 1 v v for 30 min at room temperature 1 1 ml of fixative solution to gww of sand straight after fixation cells were extracted via four steps of hes performed with a sonication probe 80 s 27 w a combination of sodiumpyrophosphate 10 mm tween 80 5 was employed as an extraction solution fresh solution 50 ml was added to sand after each treatment step while the exhausted solution was transferred into a sterile glass container 2 aliquots of the cumulative solutions were collected fixed in a solution of glutaraldehyde 1 v v 1 1 v v fixative solution sample stored in the dark at 4 c and analysed by fcm within two days 3 controls of dried 105 c overnight and incinerated 550 c 1h sand were extracted for each sample tested following the same protocol and analysed by fcm in order to distinguish background noise created by organic and inorganic particles indeed each sand sample showed unique background fluorescence signals created by particle autofluorescence controls were vital to design tailored settings of the electronic gate in order to get comparable results among the four quantification methods each sample was analysed for every single method within the same day fcm estimates of cell abundances were always lower than those given by atp and qpcr by an average factor of 0 70 0 05 and 0 09 0 01 respectively however despite differences in absolute numbers cells abundances assessed by fcm were significantly correlated with those obtained with atp p 0 01 pearson s ρ 0 98 and qpcr p 0 01 ρ 0 911 highly significant correlations were also found between atp and qpcr abundances p 0 01 ρ 0 93 table 2 very low correlations were found between all three methods and quantification of biomass using volatile solids vs 4 discussion in this study we present a flow cytometric method specifically optimised for enumerating cells present on the surface of sand particles used in water filters this method constitutes a considerable improvement on previously developed protocols for biomass quantification on sand samples from water biofilters magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 the protocol developed allows direct cell quantification free from potential biases introduced by assumptions such as equal average atp content per cell frossard et al 2016 and overcomes the limitations associated with qpcr quantification methods such as dna extraction efficiency and yield bremen et al 1999 feinstein et al 2009 and primer specificity we optimised cell detachment for fcm quantification using a combination of chemical surfactants and ionic dispersants together with low and high energy sonication as a mechanical pre treatment and different fixative methods furthermore we cross compared the developed protocol against other established and commonly employed methods for biomass quantification for water filter samples 4 1 optimisation of pre treatments for biofilm detachment chemical treatment the combination of a surfactant tween 80 with an ionic dispersant sodium pyrophosphate created the best conditions for the detachment of biofilm from particle surfaces and their dispersal into single cells allowing the highest counts in flow cytometric analyses the surfactant triton x100 detached significantly fewer cells than all the other solutions tested in contrast with previous studies chen and stewart 2000 different dispersants have previously been studied to enhance the detachment of cell agglomerates and biofilms from surfaces in an experiment conducted by chen and stewart 2000 solutions of nacl cacl2 and triton x100 performed best in removing biofilm from stainless steel slides magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 successfully employed autoclaved tap water in combination with several sonication steps for the detachment of biofilm from sand and gac particles as evaluated by atp quantification while brown et al 2015 and lavergne et al 2014 showed that the combination of a non ionic surfactant tween 80 and an ionic dispersant was the best performing solution to disperse activated sludge flocs and detach biofilm from coastal sediments we observed no significant differences in the number of total extractable cells from sand samples treated with autoclaved tap water nacl cacl2 and pp solutions the five dispersants used clustered according to three different extraction patterns similar to those previously observed by ugolini et al 2013 where a tween mix 1 tween 80 in 0 1 m edta and 0 1m tspp 2 2 tetrasodium pyrophosphate decahydrate was tested among other dispersants to detach biofilm from freshwater sediment columns the solution released the majority of cells shortly after application followed by drastic rapid attenuation of its extraction efficiency ugolini et al 2013 also observed that solutions of nacl and cacl2 showed a slower and more prolonged response similar to that described in this paper ugolini et al 2013 each of the solutions employed in this study promotes biofilm detachment and dispersal through different mechanisms non ionic surfactants such as tween 80 and triton x 100 act by disrupting hydrophobic interactions involved in cross linking the biofilm matrix this triggers the solubilisation of hydrophobic molecules that constitute the biofilms extracellular polymeric substances eps such as extracellular lipids which play an important role in biofilm adhesion chen and stewart 2000 such an effect would explain the high numbers of cells extracted at t0 by the tween pp dispersant however it is still not clear why in this experiment a completely different behaviour and a significantly lower extraction efficiency was observed for triton x 100 the increased extraction efficiency of tween pp might be explained by the fact that when the two dispersants are combined they may act through two different mechanisms tween dissolves hydrophobic molecules as described above and pp acts as a chelating agent scavenging bivalent cations such as ca2 and mg2 that crosslink the negatively charged groups on the surface of eps constituents ugolini et al 2013 velji and albright 1984 mechanical treatment we found that four cycles of high energy sonication in a tween pp solution are the most effective treatment for optimal cell counts among all the treatments tested sonication is a mechanical treatment often proposed for the removal of biofilm from a plastic material proctor et al 2016 sand and gac particles li et al 2010 magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 and marine sediments danovaro et al 2001 low energy sonication has been shown to be less effective than high energy sonication in detaching biofilm from gac and sand particles a finding that has been confirmed by our results magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 in our experiment we subjected sand particles to one cycle of les followed by seven cycles of hes we observed no significant difference between the number of cells extracted after the addition of the extraction solution tween pp or tap and after one cycle of les in both sets of samples the cumulative atp yield of the biomass that magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 obtained in their experiment using les treatment on sand samples was 50 of the biomass obtained with hes at power input comparable to the one employed in our experiment 27 w hes treatment showed a quick and drastic decrease in its extraction efficiency reaching a plateau already after one hes cycle for tween pp or after two hes for tap confirming a trend already observed by magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 however in order to ensure maximum reproducibility and to obtain comparable results we suggest a minimum of four hes cycles run for up to 80 s at a power input of 27 w shaking was also evaluated as a mechanical pre treatment of sand particles as an alternative to sonication results suggested that the combination of chemical dispersant tween pp and hes was still the treatment ensuring the highest number of cells extracted however the combination of tween pp with four cycles of shaking allowed the final recovery of the same amount of cells obtained by the combination of autoclaved tap water and hes this kind of treatment might be useful when hes cannot be applied fixative optimisation two common fixation solutions were evaluated for their ability to preserve and protect microbial cells during the extraction protocol proposed glutaraldehyde and a solution of ethanol pbs 50 the results strongly suggested that the fixation methods could affect the extraction performance and the number of both intact and total microbial cells recovered by the treatment the number of total cells extracted from glut fixed samples was significantly greater than the amount extracted from etoh fixed and pbs control samples for both extraction solutions used tween pp and tap water section 3 3 solutions of detergents such as tween 20 or triton x100 are often used to allow the permeabilisation of cell membranes in order to gain access to intracellular areas they act by breaking lipid lipid and lipid protein interactions causing the solubilisation of lipids forming the cell membrane two main fixation methods can be identified in the literature to protect cells additive and denaturing fixations chao and zhang 2011 st laurent et al 2006 glutaraldehyde along with other aldehydes such as formaldehyde and paraformaldehyde belongs to the group of additive fixative solutions these solutions fix cells through the formation of covalent chemical bonds between the proteins of the cellular membrane the effect is the creation of an outer cell cross link structure this might explain the significantly higher amount of cells detected in the glut fixed samples extracted with tween pp compared to the controls the detergent enhances the biofilm breakage through the dissolution of the eps lipids but at the same time dissolves lipids of the cellular membrane this induces cells to burst unless they are protected by the outer cross link structure between membrane proteins created by the additive fixative solutions moreover the outer cross linked structure created by glutaraldehyde bonds proved to be an effective strategy for protecting cells from the shear forces created by sonication preventing both their burst and their damage in fact the amount of both total and intact cells extracted from glut fixed samples was significantly higher than that recovered in the control samples when autoclaved tap water was used as an extraction solution glutaraldehyde however was not able to protect cells from damage due to the dissolution of the lipid membrane the number of intact cells measured in glut fixed samples extracted with tween pp was one order of magnitude lower than the amount measured in the same set of samples extracted with autoclaved tap water this suggests that while the outer structure of cells remains intact allowing the count of total cells using fcm pores created in the cell membrane by lipid dissolution caused the double positively charged molecule of the propidium iodide pi stain to penetrate and stain the cells with a stronger red fluorescence in this way the pi positive cells with damaged membranes can clearly be distinguished from intact cells during fcm analyses ramseier et al 2011 ethanol proved to be an ineffective fixative failing to protect cells against burst or damage induced by chemical dissolution of the membrane or by shear forces created by sonication in fact no statistical difference was observed between the number of total cells measured in the etoh fixed samples and controls extracted with both solutions moreover we observed that ethanol dramatically damaged the cellular membrane the number of intact cells measured in etoh fixed samples was significantly lower than the controls for both extraction solutions ethanol belongs to the denaturating fixative solutions group these solutions act by denaturing proteins through the reduction of their solubility and or disruption of hydrophobic interactions their application could induce the dissolution of cell membrane lipids with the formation of large pores in its structure therefore explaining the low counts obtained 4 2 cross comparison with other methods the protocol proposed appeared to be a consistent and reliable method for measuring microbial cells in sand samples from water filters using fcm despite differences in the absolute numbers the cell abundances measured with the protocol correlated highly with the values obtained with other classic methods employed for biomass quantification for these environments qpcr and atp analysis the absolute counts obtained with the fcm method were typically lower than the corresponding counts obtained with the atp assay and with qpcr as suggested by the slope of the linear correlations 0 7 and 0 09 respectively a previous study carried out on samples collected from several environments sediments soils and sludge directly compared cell abundances measured via the atp assay and fcm on suspensions obtained after cell detachment via three cycles of sonication in a fixative solution frossard et al 2016 the study showed that estimates based on the atp assay yielded significantly higher average microbial abundances than the fcm method the slope of the correlation between fcm and atp was on average 0 36 in that study researchers attributed the discrepancy to the different storage times 4 weeks for fcm against the 24h for atp and preservation methods paraformaldehyde for fcm and phosphate buffer for atp employed by the two protocols the much higher slope observed in our study 0 7 rather than 0 36 might be explained by the fact that the four different methods were performed on every single sample on the same day of collection overcoming in this way biases induced by different preservation strategies and time the fcm estimated slightly lower cell abundances than the atp assay this discrepancy could be attributed to the measurement of extracellular atp or additional non microbial atp belonging to other microorganisms such as fungi or micro invertebrates as well as fine roots and small plant residues that are not quantified in the fcm method other potential causes are an underestimation of the average atp content per cell and uncertainty in the determination of the slope from the data on the other hand the high discrepancy between qpcr and fcm absolute numbers could result from problems of non specificity of the qpcr primers used or from the presence of free dna from decayed cells causing qpcr to overestimate the number of cells present in a sample alternatively another reason for the high discrepancies in counts observed between the method proposed and the other two analysed could be an incomplete removal of biofilm from the sand grain surfaces a qualitative analysis of the sand grains before and after the detachment protocol using optical microscopy fig 1 si showed effective detachment of biofilm however while the method seems to effectively detach most of the biofilm developed on the surfaces and between sand grains where we expect most of the cells to be located an unknown percentage of undetached biofilm or individual cells might still be present in crevices within sand particles finally vs had much weaker correlations pearson correlation ranging from 0 001 to 0 19 as compared with all other measures of biomass concentration this is not surprising as vs includes organic matter other than cells such as the organic matter naturally present in water and coagulated during the water treatment process it is important to underline that the method here proposed has been optimised using only one type of sand factors such as different filter media gac versus sand filter media characteristics grain dimension and roughness biofilm age and composition might affect the extraction efficiency while the protocol shows good reproducibility comparable with other common methods for the quantification of cell abundances in sand samples we suggest that additional experiments should be performed to check the reproducibility of the protocol and its efficacy on samples with characteristics different from those investigated in this study 5 conclusions the results show that the optimised protocol presented is a reliable and highly reproducible method for enumerating total cells on sand particles the protocol proposed using fcm for cell quantification produces cell abundances that correlate well with alternative quantification methods high correlations were found with counts obtained with atp and qpcr the vs content was confirmed as an inaccurate method to express biomass in sand samples despite a good correlation between the trends of cell abundances qpcr seems to overestimate absolute cell counts while fcm and atp produce similar values acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge mr matthew brown for his technical help this study was supported by mermaid a marie skłodowska
