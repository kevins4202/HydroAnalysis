16320,anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr is a low energy and promising solution for sewage treatment during the treatment the fouled membrane of anmbr is recognized as an important barrier against pathogenic viruses here the role of membrane fouling of an anmbr at room temperature in the virus removal was investigated using ms2 bacteriophage as a virus surrogate results revealed that the virus removal efficiency of anmbr was in the range of 0 2 to 3 6 logs gradually increasing with the course of anmbr operation virus removal efficiency was found to be significantly correlated with transmembrane pressure r2 0 92 p 0 01 especially in the rapid fouling stage indicating that membrane fouling was the key factor in the virus removal the proportion of virus decreased from 52 03 to 15 04 in the membrane foulants when membrane fouling was aggravating rapidly yet increased from 0 74 to 21 52 in the mixed liquor meanwhile the permeate flux dramatically dropped these imply that the primary rejection mechanism of virus by membrane in the slow fouling stage is the virus adsorption onto membrane while the sieving effect is the main reason in the rapid fouling stage ex situ virus rejection test unveiled that the cake layer was the main contributor to the overall virus rejection while the greatest resistance specific virus rejection was provided by the organic pore blocking this paper provides operation strategies to balance enhanced virus removal and high permeate flux by regulating the membrane fouling process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr virus removal membrane fouling virus rejection and adsorption 1 introduction due to the increasing global demand for freshwater the safe reuse of sewage has received extensive public attention and research especially on the health risks posed by human enteric viruses sewage as the major vehicle of human fecal contaminants is the primary vector of human enteric viruses and plays an important role in virus circulation farkas et al 2018 the use of untreated or inadequately treated sewage as reclaimed water is one of the main routes of infection with human enteric viruses therefore efficient virus removal by sewage treatment processes has become a critical strategy to control the infection risk of human enteric viruses and ensure the safety of reuse water from sewage nevertheless the log removal values lrvs of human enteric viruses by conventional activated sludge processes without tertiary treatment was only in the range from 0 37 2 36 which fails to meet the reuse water safety standard osuolale and okoh 2017 prado et al 2019 membrane bioreactor mbr was developed by the combination of traditional biological treatment processes and membrane separation technology which was recognized as a safe and clean process to remove viruses since membrane in mbr can remove viruses by sieving effect adsorption and electrostatic repulsion o brien and xagoraraki 2020 zhu et al 2021 however the pristine membrane which acts as the first barrier is not sufficient to ensure reuse water safety in terms of viruses removal chaudhry et al 2015a lu et al 2013 during the mbr operation sludge flocs colloidal particles dissolved organic and inorganic matters in mixed liquor were adsorbed and deposited on the membrane surface leading to membrane fouling which is beneficial to the physical virus rejection thereby enhancing the overall virus removal by mbr de vela 2021 o brien and xagoraraki 2020 a previous study in a full scale aerobic mbr showed that lrvs of adenovirus and norovirus gii were increased by 1 6 and 0 3 respectively after 5 days of membrane backwash the finding of lu et al 2013 further confirmed that soluble microbial product foulant on the membrane surface led to higher virus rejection due to pore blocking and electrostatic repulsion obviously although membrane fouling can improve virus rejection it also results in membrane flux decrease impedes the mbr operation as a low energy and promising solution for sewage treatment anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr can convert efficiently organic matter into bioenergy through anaerobic digestion chen et al 2017 meanwhile membrane in anmbr can also serve as an important barrier against virus though numerous studies have investigated the viruses removal by aerobic mbr little is known about virus removal by anmbr from a few reports clearly there are visible distinctions between anaerobic and aerobic membrane bioreactors in terms of mixed liquor characteristics microbial communities and membrane fouling yao et al 2021 furthermore most previous studies longitudinally evaluated the correlation between virus removal and membrane fouling lacking the probe into the role of each membrane fouling component to enhance virus rejection the study aims to better understand the relationship between the entire membrane fouling formation process and overall virus removal by anmbr and focus on the contribution of each membrane fouling component to enhance virus rejection in addition the role of biomass adsorption membrane rejection inactivation in virus removal was investigated ms2 was chosen as a surrogate virus to evaluate the virus removal efficiency of anmbr in this study because of its similar size and morphology with human enteric viruses ballesté et al 2019 shirasaki et al 2016 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup a submerged anmbr with a working volume of 2 0 l was operated at room temperature of 25 c in this study fig 1 the membrane module used was polyvinylidene fluoride flat sheet membrane of a nominal pore size of 0 2 μm and membrane area of 0 0036 m2 the operating conditions are shown in table 1 the flow rate of influent and effluent of anmbr was controlled by peristaltic pumps bt100j 1a huiyu with timing treasure dj b04m kewode china for intermittent filtration and the suction cycles were provided in table 1 the produced biogas was recirculated by a diaphragm pump vby 7506 cheehie china with a constant speed of 4 5 l min to continuously scour the membrane surface by the bottom of the bioreactor a digital pressure meter sinomeasure china was installed between the membrane module and the effluent pump to record the transmembrane pressure tmp the initial mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration of seeded sludge was 8 0 g l no sludge discharge was performed except for sampling analysis and the solid retention time srt was calculated as approximately 457 days the influent of anmbr was synthetic sewage with chemical oxygen demand cod and ms2 concentration of about 500 mg l and 1010 pfu l respectively and the detailed composition was provided in table s1 according to da silva et al 2007 the virus influent concentration has no significant effects on the virus removal performance of mbr in order to facilitate the detection of ms2 concentration in the effluent 1010 pfu l was selected as the initial ms2 concentration of influent to make the ms2 concentration in effluent higher than the lower limit of detection although the ms2 concentration in influent was higher than those of human enteric viruses in real sewage corpuz et al 2020 wang et al 2020 synthetic sewage was stored at 4 c and remade every 24 h to avoid ms2 loss due to decay the decay rate of ms2 was 0 07 log h through periodically measuring the ms2 concentration of synthetic sewage in a substrate tank fig s1 in order to conduct batch tests of ms2 inactivation a control anmbr was fed with synthetic sewage without ms2 under the same operation parameters as the experiment one 2 2 ms2 stock preparation and sample collection and counting bacteriophage ms2 atcc 15597 b1 stock was obtained by propagating with their host cells e coli atcc 15597 the operation process was as follows ms2 was added to the culture which was obtained by incubating e coli in luria bertani lb broth at 37 c for 3 5 h and incubated overnight to allow ms2 propagation after incubation the mixture was centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min and then filtered through a 0 22 μm pore size membrane filter to remove bacterial debris the filtrate was directly used as ms2 stock without further treatment all of the influent and effluent samples of anmbr were carefully harvested for infection assay infective ms2 virions were enumerated by the double agar layer according to epa method 1602 u s epa 2001 specifically the collected sample was serially diluted with sterilized phosphate buffered saline solution for accurate plate counting the diluted sample was added to the lb broth with log phase e coli and the mixture was mixed with the top agar 0 7 agar and then poured onto the bottom agar 1 5 agar after overnight incubation at 37 c and the plates with 30 to 300 plaques were selected for counting the number of plaques forming units pfu was converted to the number ms2 present in a given volume of the sample the concentration of ms2 in the mixed liquor was determined by quantifing separately the liquid and solid phases firstly the liquid and solid phases were separated by centrifugation at 10 000 g at 4 c for 1 h the supernatant was carefully harvested to determine the volume and ms2 concentration to obtain the ms2 associated with the liquid phase the solid phase was resuspended in 10 tris glycine beef extract buffer of the same volume as mixed liquor and mixed thoroughly after thorough mixing the sample was eluted for 30 min to elute ms2 and then centrifuged at 10 000 g for 30 min the eluent was carefully harvested to determine the ms2 concentration to obtain ms2 associated with the solid phase the ms2 concentration with the mixed liquor was calculated by eq 1 1 c m i x c l v l c e v e 4 78 v m i x where cl and vl are the ms2 concentration and the volume of the liquid phase respectively ce and ve are the ms2 concentration and the volume of eluent respectively cmix and vmix are the ms2 concentration and the volume of mixed liquor respectively the ms2 recovery efficiency from solid phase of mixed liquor is 4 78 2 3 ms2 inactivation in the mixed liquor a series of batch tests were conducted to study the contribution of ms2 inactivation in different mlss concentrations ms2 free mixed liquor from the control anmbr was centrifuged at 10 000 g for 1 h to obtain high mlss concentration then the specific volumes of synthetic sewage were added to attain the finally ms2 concentration of 1010 pfu l and mlss concentrations of 8 mg l 10 mg l 14 mg l respectively and finally were placed on an oscillator at 100 rpm and 25 c ms2 of the control group was in sterilized phosphate buffered saline solution without anaerobic sludge during incubation regular sampling was subjected to measure ms2 concentration in the mixed liquor all the samples were analyzed in triplicate inactivation kinetics was fitted by a first order model to the data according to the following eq 2 2 l n c t c 0 k o b s t where c0 and ct pfu l are the concentrations of ms2 at time 0 and t respectively kobs is the pseudo first order inactivation rate constant day 1 2 4 effect of anaerobic digestion biological processes on ms2 inactivation two groups of serum bottles with normal anaerobic sludge and inactivated sludge were incubated at 25 1 c to investigate the anaerobic digestion biological processes effects on ms2 inactivation the sludge substrate ch3coona buffer nahco3 and kh3po4 and ms2 stock were successively added into the serum bottles after that the headspace of all bottles was purged with nitrogen gas for 2 min to remove oxygen the mixed liquor of serum bottles was taken regularly to determine ms2 concentration inactivated sludge was acquired by 30 min incubation at 80 c and no biogas was produced during the experimental period 2 5 in situ membrane resistance determination the total in situ membrane resistance rt value was calculated using eq 3 the rate of the tmp increase with time can be used to indicate the fouling rate and calculated by eq 4 3 r t t m p μ j 4 f o u l i n g r a t e d t m p d t where j is the permeate flux m3 m2 s tmp is the transmembrane pressure mentioned pa and μ is the dynamic viscosity of the permeate pa s 2 6 ex situ virus rejection test for membrane ex situ virus rejection test of the pristine membrane was carried out independently a membrane module with a pristine membrane was placed in a container filled with tap water containing ms2 no anaerobic sludge filtration was then conducted by suction at a constant flux the virus rejection by the pristine membrane was expressed as the changes in ms2 concentration in the container and ms2 concentration in the permeate the intrinsic membrane resistance was calculated according to changes in tmp during filtration the duration of the test was less than 10 min so the inactivation of ms2 was not considered it was assumed that the membrane fouling consisted of the cake layer organic pore blocking inorganic pore blocking irreversible fouling yang et al 2019 to identify the ms2 rejection efficiency of each membrane fouling component when tmp increased to 30 kpa the membrane was withdrawn from anmbr for cleaning and virus rejection test the cleaning process was performed as following steps firstly the membrane was cleaned with tap water to remove the cake layer on the membrane surface subsequently the membrane was immersed in 0 1 sodium hypochlorite solution for 24 h to clean organics fouling finally 10 g l of the citric acid solution was used to clean inorganics fouling the virus rejection test was performed after each cleaning process as that for the pristine membrane the total membrane rejection efficiency of virus re t consisted of the pristine

the irreversible fouling rejection re ir 5 r e t r e m r e c r e o r g r e i n o r g r e i r the total membrane resistance rt can be calculated as the sum of the intrinsic resistance of pristine

r g r i r 2 7 ms2 removal efficiency evaluation ms2 removal efficiency could be expressed as lrv and was calculated using eq 7 lrvanmbr lrvm and lrvb were applied to represent the overall removal membrane rejection biomass adsorption respectively to distinguish the membrane rejection and biomass adsorption the ms2 concentration in the liquid phase of mixed liquor was considered to be the result after biomass adsorption treatment the virus in the liquid phase after centrifugation at 10 000 g for 1 h theoretical size cutoff 340 nm was regarded as the free virus in our study in addition virus inactivation in the liquid phase is also considered to be virus removal by biomass adsorption therefore biomass adsorption was overestimated and membrane rejection was underestimated in our study 7 l r v l o g c t c 0 where c0 and ct represent the ms2 concentration before and after treatment respectively the ms2 mass in the system consisted of the ms2 in the effluent the increased ms2 in mixed liquor the ms2 in discharged mixed liquor from anmbr the ms2 inactivated in mixed liquor and the ms2 on the membrane ms2 mass balance of the anmbr was used to estimate the ms2 amount on the membrane 8 q i n c i n q e f c e f c i n c r e a s e v c w v w m s 2 m e m b r a n e m s 2 i n a c t i v a t e d where qin and qef represent influent flow and effluent flow respectively cin cef

discussion 3 1 virus removal and membrane fouling the anmbr was kept running for a total of 77 days at room temperature of 25 c during the stable operation of the anmbr the ch4 proportion in biogas was more than 85 cod concentration in the effluent was always lower than 30 mg l and cod removal efficiency was more than 90 fig s2 the cod degradation efficiency and biogas composition in the course of the anmbr operation prove its good anaerobic digestion performance the ms2 concentration in effluent gradually decreased with the operation of anmbr and the overall removal efficiency of ms2 during the investigation varied from 0 2 to 3 6 logs fig 2 a and 2b in the study of fox stuckey 2015 the lrv of anmbr was calculated as ms2 concentration difference between mixed liquor and effluent and the ms2 concentration in mixed liquor of anmbr was always higher than that in influent because of the ms2 adsorption in suspended solids therefore the maximum ms2 removal efficiency of anmbr in fox stuckey study was greater than our study although the occurrence and removal of microbial indicators from municipal wastewater by nine different mbr systems were studied in hirani et al 2012 all the processes of mbr system were the combination of anoxic aerobic membrane the virus removal of the combined process system is higher than that of the single membrane system because more suspended solids adsorbed virus de luca et al 2013 reported that the removal of indigenous bacteriophages from municipal wastewater by a full scale aerobic membrane bioreactor and three indigenous bacteriophages were removed by 4 logs which were higher than that in this study the difference in removal efficiency may be due to the fact that indigenous bacteriophages in real sewage are associated with particles and easily rejected by the membrane while seeded ms2 virions are not particle associated in synthetic sewage and easily passed through membrane pore in addition the different adsorption properties of aerobic and anaerobic suspended solids to bacteriophages may be also responsible for the disparity of removal efficiency tmp and membrane resistance were used as indicators of membrane fouling fig 2c shows tmp and membrane resistance profiles along with operation at the beginning of the operation the slow fouling stage within the range of about 5 0 to 8 0 kpa followed by a rapid fouling stage here referred to as tmp jump where the tmp increased from 8 0 to 30 0 kpa the slow fouling stage lasted for 67 days and the fouling rate was 0 01 kpa d the duration of the rapid fouling stage was from the 68th day to the 77th day and the fouling rate was 1 55 kpa d organic and inorganic particles penetrated and deposited into the membrane pore facilitating the later formation of the cake layer which would be responsible for the slow fouling stage and the major fouling mechanism is cake layer compression in the rapid fouling stage lei et al 2021 the ms2 removal efficiency was positively correlated with tmp r2 0 92 p 0 01 indicating that membrane fouling was the key factor in the virus removal by anmbr fig 1d a significant correlation between virus removal efficiency and membrane fouling was also observed in aerobic mbr yin et al 2016 in the slow fouling stage a weak correlation was seen between tmp and virus removal efficiency r2 0 37 p 0 05 while the correlation became significant in the rapid fouling stage r2 0 70 p 0 05 this result suggested that the contribution of virus rejection by membrane was more prominent when the membrane fouling was accumulated to the rapid fouling stage the in situ membrane resistance showed that the total membrane resistance was 3 98 1011 m 1 at tmp of 30 kpa fig 2c and ms2 removal efficiency was positively correlated with total membrane resistance fig s3 related research showed that membrane resistance may vary with different operating conditions organic loading rate adding medium etc at the same tmp chen et al 2017 lei et al 2019 therefore the relationship between membrane fouling indicators and virus removal efficiency needs further exploration in a pilot scale anmbr periodic backwashes of the membrane were carried out to mitigate membrane fouling in the rapid fouling stage the membrane fouling was mitigated after the backwash and then aggravated till the next backwash the membrane fouling proceeds always in the rapid fouling stage within each backwash cycle kong et al 2021 which suggests that tmp could be used as a monitoring parameter to estimate the virus removal for a pilot scale anmbr apart from the virus rejection by the membrane adsorption and electrostatic repulsion between viruses and mlss also play an important role in virus removal by mbr chaudhry et al 2015a miura et al 2018 prado et al 2019 differences in the structure of capsid proteins among viruses determine the level of virus association with mlss which affects the removal performance of each virus type in the same mbr o brien and xagoraraki 2020 differences in aggregation caused by different virus types and sewage characteristics including ph ionic concentration and organic type etc are also reasons for the different virus removal performance in mbr da silva et al 2011 gerba and betancourt 2017 to secure the safety of anmbr effluent reuse the viruses removal performance of anmbr should also be evaluated by using other human enteric viruses not only ms2 many studies have demonstrated that viruses are frequently attached onto or enmeshed within suspended inorganic and organic particles in real sewage particles associated with viruses which are larger than the pore size of the membrane should be rejected in the bioreactor wu et al 2018 the removal efficiency of indigenous ms2 coliphage was higher than that of seeded ms2 coliphage in the same aerobic mbr irrespective of the membrane pore size hirani et al 2010 the seeded ms2 virions are not particle associated in synthetic sewage and need to be adsorbed on anaerobic sludge floc particles before rejection of membrane in our study and limited adsorption of viruses by anaerobic sludge floc particles therefore the virus removal performance of anmbr might be weakened by using synthetic sewage with seeded ms2 to simulate real sewage based on the above analysis there are several limitations in evaluating the human enteric viruses removal efficiency of anmbr treating synthetic sewage using ms2 as a surrogate virus 3 2 virus concentrations at different fouling stages the average ms2 concentration on the solid phase was always higher than in the liquid phase at different membrane fouling stages probably due to the ms2 adsorption in suspended solid fig 3 a more details of the data were presented on the supplementary materials fig s4 when the membrane fouling state changed from the slow fouling stage to the rapid fouling stage mlss concentration increased from 8 0 g l to 14 8 g l ms2 concentration from 10 80 log pfu l to 11 72 log pfu l and ms2 adsorption amount weighed by mlss mass from 9 84 log pfu g to 10 51 log pfu g fig 3b it was calculated that 48 55 increase of ms2 concentration was related to the adsorped amount weighed by mlss mass increase and 51 45 corresponded with the mlss increase suspended solids and microbial metabolites were intercepted by aggravated membrane fouling yu and zhang 2019 thus increasing the mlss concentration also enhanced microbial metabolites interception changed the mixed liquor characteristics such as extracellular polymeric substances eps content the ratio of protein to polysaccharide etc which in turn may improve adsorption amount weighed by mlss mass at the rapid fouling stage mlss is classified as visible particles greater than 10 μm sub visible particles 10 μm 0 45 μm and invisible particles less than 0 45 μm according to particles size zhou et al 2019 to improve our understanding of the contribution and disparity of different size particles to adsorb virus stepwise rejection test and particles size distribution analysis was performed si section s2 the mlss particles ranged from 3 89 to 88 μm with a median particles size of 14 25 μm fig s5a the contribution of the visible particles sub visible particles invisible particles to adsorb virus was 93 71 1 24 4 84 respectively fig s5c which illustrated that the visible particles were the main contributor to adsorb virus in mlss meanwhile virus adsorption amount weighed by visible particles mass was greater than that of sub visible particles fig s5d most likely due to the differences in the organic and morphological composition between the visible particles and sub visible particles zhou et al 2019 adjusting particle size distribution of sludge floc in mixed liquor could enhance the virus associated with mlss and then improve the virus removal of anmbr 3 3 virus inactivation in the mixed liquor in contrast to the control group 0 mg l ms2 inactivation rates were significantly slower with mlss during the whole experiment fig 4 a in the case of mlss the suspended solids can protect adsorbed ms2 against inactivation tang et al 2021 minimal changes in ms2 inactivation rate were observed as the mlss concentration was increased from 8 mg l to 14 mg l shang et al 2005 investigated how different mlss levels affected virus rejection by the membrane and found that similar or lower virus rejection with increasing mlss concentration based on the conclusion made in section 3 2 optimizing the operating condition by changing the mlss concentration to enhance virus removal was associated with adsorption instead of inactivation and membrane rejection in addition to its role as a shelter microbial activity in mixed liquor also affected ms2 inactivation ms2 inactivation in the inactivated sludge was more rapid than in normal anaerobic sludge showing that anaerobic digestion biological processes effects might improve the virus resistance to inactivation fig 4b additionally the mean ammonium concentration in the anmbr effluent was 55 mg l and ph was 7 5 indicating that nh3 mediated inactivation in mlss was negligible fig s2 decrey et al 2015 3 4 virus rejection by each membrane fouling component the cake layer resistance accounted for 85 93 of total membrane resistance indicating major fouling mechanism was from the cake layer fig 5 a correspondingly virus rejection by cake layer in the total virus rejection made up 54 11 suggesting that the greatest contributor to total virus rejection was provided by the cake layer fig 5b however chaudhry et al 2015b revealed that backwashed membrane was the main contributor to total virus removal in a full scale mbr with a nominal pore size of 0 04 μm the membrane pore size in chaudhry s study was very similar to the target viruses whereas the membrane pore size in our study was about 10 times larger than the virus size the smaller membrane pore size enhances the contribution of the backwashed membrane to virus rejection because the membrane with smaller pore size is better to reject virus by sieving effect wu et al 2017 zhu et al 2021 additionally the relative contribution of the cake layer formed after only 5 days of backwashing was studied in chaudhry s study nevertheless the cake layer derived from more serious cake layer fouling thus improving the contribution of the cake layer to the virus rejection in overall virus reject in our study the differences in membrane pore size and cake layer state cause the changes in the relative contribution of each membrane fouling component to reject viruses the specific virus rejection expressed by virus rejection per membrane resistance is shown in fig 5c the specific virus rejection of organic pore blocking resistance was 22 70 lrv r org followed by inorganic pore blocking of 14 58 lrv r inorg while specific virus rejection of cake layer resistance was the smallest and only 2 09 lrv rc the pore blocking fouling is more beneficial to improve virus rejection of membrane than cake layer fouling chen et al 2017 reported that pore blocking accounted for the majority of the total resistances at a low organic loading rate olr whereas the cake layer accounted for the majority of the total resistance at high olrs thus virus rejection rate of the membrane in anmbr operating with a low olr was higher than that with a high olr in the same membrane fouling state due to progressed pore blocking fouling low olr may be more favorable to balance high virus removal efficiency and permeate flux by impacting the membrane resistance distribution 3 5 mechanism of fouled membrane to virus rejection fig 6 provides the ms2 mass balances of the anmbr at the slow fouling stage and the rapid fouling stage respectively foulants enhance virus rejection of membrane by adsorption and electrostatic repulsion between virus and foulants as well as sieving effect lu et al 2013 adsorption between virus and fouling layer rise to an increase in virus content on the membrane while sieving effect and electrostatic repulsion between virus and fouling layer led to virus content increase in the mixed liquor in the slow fouling stage the ms2 proportion in the mixed liquor and the fouling layer was 0 74 and 52 03 respectively and in the rapid fouling stage they were 21 52 and 15 04 respectively the virus distribution changes implied that the primary mechanism of virus rejection by membrane was virus adsorption on the membrane in the slow fouling stage while the sieving effect and electrostatic repulsion were the main reason in the rapid fouling stage which might be attributable to the changes in the fouling state and associated microbial extracellular polymers in addition significant permeate flux decrease as the result of membrane fouling during the rapid fouling stage which indicated that the size sieving effect may be the dominant mechanism of enhanced virus rejection by the fouled membrane in the rapid fouling stage sewage was fed into anmbr and the virus was adsorbed or rejected in the mixed liquor viruses intercepted in the bioreactor were inactivated by predation enzymatic breakdown and environmental stress although there was no obvious difference in virus inactivation rate between the slow fouling stage and the rapid fouling stage the amount of inactivated virus in the rapid stage was higher than in the slow fouling stage because of higher virus concentration in the rapid fouling stage moreover the proportion of virus inactivation was always high in both the slow fouling stage and the rapid fouling stage which means that viruses intercepted in the bioreactor were inactivated with long srt the long srt of anmbr can achieve the goal of reducing the total virus amount including effluent and sludge released into the environment whereas for the aerobic mbr rapid sludge growth results in short srt and viruses on sludge in the bioreactor may enter the environment through sludge discharge 3 6 contributions of biomass adsorption and membrane rejection to virus removal the membrane rejection and biomass adsorption at the initial tmp jump and end of the time course of anmbr operation were analyzed to understand the role of membrane rejection and biomass adsorption fig 7 when tmp was 5 0 kpa and 8 0 kpa which corresponds to the initial and tmp jump respectively the lrvb was 0 2 and 0 25 the lrvm was 0 31 and 1 65 respectively the lrvb was comparable to lrvm in the initial stage of membrane fouling and membrane rejection was much higher than biomass adsorption after the slow fouling stage when tmp was 30 kpa that is at the end of the time course of anmbr the contribution of virus rejection of membrane including pristine membrane irreversible fouling organic pore blocking inorganic pore blocking cake layer formation cake layer compression was much higher than that of biomass adsorption by calculation the lrvs of ms2 rejection by the pristine membrane irreversible fouling organic pore blocking inorganic pore blocking cake layer formation cake layer compression were 0 25 0 32 0 55 0 24 0 32 1 33 respectively the cake layer compression is the most important factor for improving virus removal by membrane fouling in the pilot scale anmbr the membrane fouling caused by the cake layer compression was mitigated by periodic backwashing and lvranmbr decreased to 2 27 logs immediately after backwashing performance and then increased till the next backwashing nevertheless the lvranmbr after backwashing was still higher than that of conventional activated sludge processes prado et al 2019 considering the increasing demand for water reuse safety appropriate measures should be taken to improve virus removal of anmbr especially after backwashing fortunately operational practices such as coagulation pretreatment are likely to enhance virus removal of anmbr after backwashing by promoting viral agglomeration in sewage lee et al 2017 4 conclusion virus removal by anmbr treating sewage was up to 3 6 logs the significant correlation between virus removal and membrane fouling especially in the stage of rapid fouling indicated that membrane fouling was the key factor in the virus removal by anmbr aggravated membrane fouling leads to an increase in the virus concentration in the mixed liquor which is related to the increase of suspended solid and metabolites the long srt of anmbr can achieve the goal of reducing the total virus amount released into the environment the cake layer was the main contributor to virus rejection in anmbr while the greatest resistance specific virus rejection was provided by organic pore blocking in the slow fouling stage the primary mechanism of virus rejection was adsorption on the membrane while the sieving effect could be the dominant

product foulant on the membrane surface led to higher virus rejection due to pore blocking and electrostatic repulsion obviously although membrane fouling can improve virus rejection it also results in membrane flux decrease impedes the mbr operation as a low energy and promising solution for sewage treatment anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr can convert efficiently organic matter into bioenergy through anaerobic digestion chen et al 2017 meanwhile membrane in anmbr can also serve as an important barrier against virus though numerous studies have investigated the viruses removal by aerobic mbr little is known about virus removal by anmbr from a few reports clearly there are visible distinctions between anaerobic and aerobic membrane bioreactors in terms of mixed liquor characteristics microbial communities and membrane fouling yao et al 2021 furthermore most previous studies longitudinally evaluated the correlation between virus removal and membrane fouling lacking the probe into the role of each membrane fouling component to enhance virus rejection the study aims to better understand the relationship between the entire membrane fouling formation process and overall virus removal by anmbr and focus on the contribution of each membrane fouling component to enhance virus rejection in addition the role of biomass adsorption membrane rejection inactivation in virus removal was investigated ms2 was chosen as a surrogate virus to evaluate the virus removal efficiency of anmbr in this study because of its similar size and morphology with human enteric viruses ballesté et al 2019 shirasaki et al 2016 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup a submerged anmbr with a working volume of 2 0 l was operated at room temperature of 25 c in this study fig 1 the membrane module used was polyvinylidene fluoride flat sheet membrane of a nominal pore size of 0 2 μm and membrane area of 0 0036 m2 the operating conditions are shown in table 1 the flow rate of influent and effluent of anmbr was controlled by peristaltic pumps bt100j 1a huiyu with timing treasure dj b04m kewode china for intermittent filtration and the suction cycles were provided in table 1 the produced biogas was recirculated by a diaphragm pump vby 7506 cheehie china with a constant speed of 4 5 l min to continuously scour the membrane surface by the bottom of the bioreactor a digital pressure meter sinomeasure china was installed between the membrane module and the effluent pump to record the transmembrane pressure tmp the initial mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration of seeded sludge was 8 0 g l no sludge discharge was performed except for sampling analysis and the solid retention time srt was calculated as approximately 457 days the influent of anmbr was synthetic sewage with chemical oxygen demand cod and ms2 concentration of about 500 mg l and 1010 pfu l respectively and the detailed composition was provided in table s1 according to da silva et al 2007 the virus influent concentration has no significant effects on the virus removal performance of mbr in order to facilitate the detection of ms2 concentration in the effluent 1010 pfu l was selected as the initial ms2 concentration of influent to make the ms2 concentration in effluent higher than the lower limit of detection although the ms2 concentration in influent was higher than those of human enteric viruses in real sewage corpuz et al 2020 wang et al 2020 synthetic sewage was stored at 4 c and remade every 24 h to avoid ms2 loss due to decay the decay rate of ms2 was 0 07 log h through periodically measuring the ms2 concentration of synthetic sewage in a substrate tank fig s1 in order to conduct batch tests of ms2 inactivation a control anmbr was fed with synthetic sewage without ms2 under the same operation parameters as the experiment one 2 2 ms2 stock preparation and sample collection and counting bacteriophage ms2 atcc 15597 b1 stock was obtained by propagating with their host cells e coli atcc 15597 the operation process was as follows ms2 was added to the culture which was obtained by incubating e coli in luria bertani lb broth at 37 c for 3 5 h and incubated overnight to allow ms2 propagation after incubation the mixture was centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min and then filtered through a 0 22 μm pore size membrane filter to remove bacterial debris the filtrate was directly used as ms2 stock without further treatment all of the influent and effluent samples of anmbr were carefully harvested for infection assay infective ms2 virions were enumerated by the double agar layer according to epa method 1602 u s epa 2001 specifically the collected sample was serially diluted with sterilized phosphate buffered saline solution for accurate plate counting the diluted sample was added to the lb broth with log phase e coli and the mixture was mixed with the top agar 0 7 agar and then poured onto the bottom agar 1 5 agar after overnight incubation at 37 c and the plates with 30 to 300 plaques were selected for counting the number of plaques forming units pfu was converted to the number ms2 present in a given volume of the sample the concentration of ms2 in the mixed liquor was determined by quantifing separately the liquid and solid phases firstly the liquid and solid phases were separated by centrifugation at 10 000 g at 4 c for 1 h the supernatant was carefully harvested to determine the volume and ms2 concentration to obtain the ms2 associated with the liquid phase the solid phase was resuspended in 10 tris glycine beef extract buffer of the same volume as mixed liquor and mixed thoroughly after thorough mixing the sample was eluted for 30 min to elute ms2 and then centrifuged at 10 000 g for 30 min the eluent was carefully harvested to determine the ms2 concentration to obtain ms2 associated with the solid phase the ms2 concentration with the mixed liquor was calculated by eq 1 1 c m i x c l v l c e v e 4 78 v m i x where cl and vl are the ms2 concentration and the volume of the liquid phase respectively ce and ve are the ms2 concentration and the volume of eluent respectively cmix and vmix are the ms2 concentration and the volume of mixed liquor respectively the ms2 recovery efficiency from solid phase of mixed liquor is 4 78 2 3 ms2 inactivation in the mixed liquor a series of batch tests were conducted to study the contribution of ms2 inactivation in different mlss concentrations ms2 free mixed liquor from the control anmbr was centrifuged at 10 000 g for 1 h to obtain high mlss concentration then the specific volumes of synthetic sewage were added to attain the finally ms2 concentration of 1010 pfu l and mlss concentrations of 8 mg l 10 mg l 14 mg l respectively and finally were placed on an oscillator at 100 rpm and 25 c ms2 of the control group was in sterilized phosphate buffered saline solution without anaerobic sludge during incubation regular sampling was subjected to measure ms2 concentration in the mixed liquor all the samples were analyzed in triplicate inactivation kinetics was fitted by a first order model to the data according to the following eq 2 2 l n c t c 0 k o b s t where c0 and ct pfu l are the concentrations of ms2 at time 0 and t respectively kobs is the pseudo first order inactivation rate constant day 1 2 4 effect of anaerobic digestion biological processes on ms2 inactivation two groups of serum bottles with normal anaerobic sludge and inactivated sludge were incubated at 25 1 c to investigate the anaerobic digestion biological processes effects on ms2 inactivation the sludge substrate ch3coona buffer nahco3 and kh3po4 and ms2 stock were successively added into the serum bottles after that the headspace of all bottles was purged with nitrogen gas for 2 min to remove oxygen the mixed liquor of serum bottles was taken regularly to determine ms2 concentration inactivated sludge was acquired by 30 min incubation at 80 c and no biogas was produced during the experimental period 2 5 in situ membrane resistance determination the total in situ membrane resistance rt value was calculated using eq 3 the rate of the tmp increase with time can be used to indicate the fouling rate and calculated by eq 4 3 r t t m p μ j 4 f o u l i n g r a t e d t m p d t where j is the permeate flux m3 m2 s tmp is the transmembrane pressure mentioned pa and μ is the dynamic viscosity of the permeate pa s 2 6 ex situ virus rejection test for membrane ex situ virus rejection test of the pristine membrane was carried out independently a membrane module with a pristine membrane was placed in a container filled with tap water containing ms2 no anaerobic sludge filtration was then conducted by suction at a constant flux the virus rejection by the pristine membrane was expressed as the changes in ms2 concentration in the container and ms2 concentration in the permeate the intrinsic membrane resistance was calculated according to changes in tmp during filtration the duration of the test was less than 10 min so the inactivation of ms2 was not considered it was assumed that the membrane fouling consisted of the cake layer organic pore blocking inorganic pore blocking irreversible fouling yang et al 2019 to identify the ms2 rejection efficiency of each membrane fouling component when tmp increased to 30 kpa the membrane was withdrawn from anmbr for cleaning and virus rejection test the cleaning process was performed as following steps firstly the membrane was cleaned with tap water to remove the cake layer on the membrane surface subsequently the membrane was immersed in 0 1 sodium hypochlorite solution for 24 h to clean organics fouling finally 10 g l of the citric acid solution was used to clean inorganics fouling the virus rejection test was performed after each cleaning process as that for the pristine membrane the total membrane rejection efficiency of virus re t consisted of the pristine

membrane rejection biomass adsorption respectively to distinguish the membrane rejection and biomass adsorption the ms2 concentration in the liquid phase of mixed liquor was considered to be the result after biomass adsorption treatment the virus in the liquid phase after centrifugation at 10 000 g for 1 h theoretical size cutoff 340 nm was regarded as the free virus in our study in addition virus inactivation in the liquid phase is also considered to be virus removal by biomass adsorption therefore biomass adsorption was overestimated and membrane rejection was underestimated in our study 7 l r v l o g c t c 0 where c0 and ct represent the ms2 concentration before and after treatment respectively the ms2 mass in the system consisted of the ms2 in the effluent the increased ms2 in mixed liquor the ms2 in discharged mixed liquor from anmbr the ms2 inactivated in mixed liquor and the ms2 on the membrane ms2 mass balance of the anmbr was used to estimate the ms2 amount on the

discussion 3 1 virus removal and membrane fouling the anmbr was kept running for a total of 77 days at room temperature of 25 c during the stable operation of the anmbr the ch4 proportion in biogas was more than 85 cod concentration in the effluent was always lower than 30 mg l and cod removal efficiency was more than 90 fig s2 the cod degradation efficiency and biogas composition in the course of the anmbr operation prove its good anaerobic digestion performance the ms2 concentration in effluent gradually decreased with the operation of anmbr and the overall removal efficiency of ms2 during the investigation varied from 0 2 to 3 6 logs fig 2 a and 2b in the study of fox stuckey 2015 the lrv of anmbr was calculated as ms2 concentration difference between mixed liquor and effluent and the ms2 concentration in mixed liquor of anmbr was always higher than that in influent because of the ms2 adsorption in suspended solids therefore the maximum ms2 removal efficiency of anmbr in fox stuckey study was greater than our study although the occurrence and removal of microbial indicators from municipal wastewater by nine different mbr systems were studied in hirani et al 2012 all the processes of mbr system were the combination of anoxic aerobic membrane the virus removal of the combined process system is higher than that of the single membrane system because more suspended solids adsorbed virus de luca et al 2013 reported that the removal of indigenous bacteriophages from municipal wastewater by a full scale aerobic membrane bioreactor and three indigenous bacteriophages were removed by 4 logs which were higher than that in this study the difference in removal efficiency may be due to the fact that indigenous bacteriophages in real sewage are associated with particles and easily rejected by the membrane while seeded ms2 virions are not particle associated in synthetic sewage and easily passed through membrane pore in addition the different adsorption properties of aerobic and anaerobic suspended solids to bacteriophages may be also responsible for the disparity of removal efficiency tmp and membrane resistance were used as indicators of membrane fouling fig 2c shows tmp and membrane resistance profiles along with operation at the beginning of the operation the slow fouling stage within the range of about 5 0 to 8 0 kpa followed by a rapid fouling stage here referred to as tmp jump where the tmp increased from 8 0 to 30 0 kpa the slow fouling stage lasted for 67 days and the fouling rate was 0 01 kpa d the duration of the rapid fouling stage was from the 68th day to the 77th day and the fouling rate was 1 55 kpa d organic and inorganic particles penetrated and deposited into the membrane pore facilitating the later formation of the cake layer which would be responsible for the slow fouling stage and the major fouling mechanism is cake layer compression in the rapid fouling stage lei et al 2021 the ms2 removal efficiency was positively correlated with tmp r2 0 92 p 0 01 indicating that membrane fouling was the key factor in the virus removal by anmbr fig 1d a significant correlation between virus removal efficiency and membrane fouling was also observed in aerobic mbr yin et al 2016 in the slow fouling stage a weak correlation was seen between tmp and virus removal efficiency r2 0 37 p 0 05 while the correlation became significant in the rapid fouling stage r2 0 70 p 0 05 this result suggested that the contribution of virus rejection by membrane was more prominent when the membrane fouling was accumulated to the rapid fouling stage the in situ membrane resistance showed that the total membrane resistance was 3 98 1011 m 1 at tmp of 30 kpa fig 2c and ms2 removal efficiency was positively correlated with total membrane resistance fig s3 related research showed that membrane resistance may vary with different operating conditions organic loading rate adding medium etc at the same tmp chen et al 2017 lei et al 2019 therefore the relationship between membrane fouling indicators and virus removal efficiency needs further exploration in a pilot scale anmbr periodic backwashes of the membrane were carried out to mitigate membrane fouling in the rapid fouling stage the membrane fouling was mitigated after the backwash and then aggravated till the next backwash the membrane fouling proceeds always in the rapid fouling stage within each backwash cycle kong et al 2021 which suggests that tmp could be used as a monitoring parameter to estimate the virus removal for a pilot scale anmbr apart from the virus rejection by the membrane adsorption and electrostatic repulsion between viruses and mlss also play an important role in virus removal by mbr chaudhry et al 2015a miura et al 2018 prado et al 2019 differences in the structure of capsid proteins among viruses determine the level of virus association with mlss which affects the removal performance of each virus type in the same mbr o brien and xagoraraki 2020 differences in aggregation caused by different virus types and sewage characteristics including ph ionic concentration and organic type etc are also reasons for the different virus removal performance in mbr da silva et al 2011 gerba and betancourt 2017 to secure the safety of anmbr effluent reuse the viruses removal performance of anmbr should also be evaluated by using other human enteric viruses not only ms2 many studies have demonstrated that viruses are frequently attached onto or enmeshed within suspended inorganic and organic particles in real sewage particles associated with viruses which are larger than the pore size of the membrane should be rejected in the bioreactor wu et al 2018 the removal efficiency of indigenous ms2 coliphage was higher than that of seeded ms2 coliphage in the same aerobic mbr irrespective of the membrane pore size hirani et al 2010 the seeded ms2 virions are not particle associated in synthetic sewage and need to be adsorbed on anaerobic sludge floc particles before rejection of membrane in our study and limited adsorption of viruses by anaerobic sludge floc particles therefore the virus removal performance of anmbr might be weakened by using synthetic sewage with seeded ms2 to simulate real sewage based on the above analysis there are several limitations in evaluating the human enteric viruses removal efficiency of anmbr treating synthetic sewage using ms2 as a surrogate virus 3 2 virus concentrations at different fouling stages the average ms2 concentration on the solid phase was always higher than in the liquid phase at different membrane fouling stages probably due to the ms2 adsorption in suspended solid fig 3 a more details of the data were presented on the supplementary materials fig s4 when the membrane fouling state changed from the slow fouling stage to the rapid fouling stage mlss concentration increased from 8 0 g l to 14 8 g l ms2 concentration from 10 80 log pfu l to 11 72 log pfu l and ms2 adsorption amount weighed by mlss mass from 9 84 log pfu g to 10 51 log pfu g fig 3b it was calculated that 48 55 increase of ms2 concentration was related to the adsorped amount weighed by mlss mass increase and 51 45 corresponded with the mlss increase suspended solids and microbial metabolites were intercepted by aggravated membrane fouling yu and zhang 2019 thus increasing the mlss concentration also enhanced microbial metabolites interception changed the mixed liquor characteristics such as extracellular polymeric substances eps content the ratio of protein to polysaccharide etc which in turn may improve adsorption amount weighed by mlss mass at the rapid fouling stage mlss is classified as visible particles greater than 10 μm sub visible particles 10 μm 0 45 μm and invisible particles less than 0 45 μm according to particles size zhou et al 2019 to improve our understanding of the contribution and disparity of different size particles to adsorb virus stepwise rejection test and particles size distribution analysis was performed si section s2 the mlss particles ranged from 3 89 to 88 μm with a median particles size of 14 25 μm fig s5a the contribution of the visible particles sub visible particles invisible particles to adsorb virus was 93 71 1 24 4 84 respectively fig s5c which illustrated that the visible particles were the main contributor to adsorb virus in mlss meanwhile virus adsorption amount weighed by visible particles mass was greater than that of sub visible particles fig s5d most likely due to the differences in the organic and morphological composition between the visible particles and sub visible particles zhou et al 2019 adjusting particle size distribution of sludge floc in mixed liquor could enhance the virus associated with mlss and then improve the virus removal of anmbr 3 3 virus inactivation in the mixed liquor in contrast to the control group 0 mg l ms2 inactivation rates were significantly slower with mlss during the whole experiment fig 4 a in the case of mlss the suspended solids can protect adsorbed ms2 against inactivation tang et al 2021 minimal changes in ms2 inactivation rate were observed as the mlss concentration was increased from 8 mg l to 14 mg l shang et al 2005 investigated how different mlss levels affected virus rejection by the membrane and found that similar or lower virus rejection with increasing mlss concentration based on the conclusion made in section 3 2 optimizing the operating condition by changing the mlss concentration to enhance virus removal was associated with adsorption instead of inactivation and membrane rejection in addition to its role as a shelter microbial activity in mixed liquor also affected ms2 inactivation ms2 inactivation in the inactivated sludge was more rapid than in normal anaerobic sludge showing that anaerobic digestion biological processes effects might improve the virus resistance to inactivation fig 4b additionally the mean ammonium concentration in the anmbr effluent was 55 mg l and ph was 7 5 indicating that nh3 mediated inactivation in mlss was negligible fig s2 decrey et al 2015 3 4 virus rejection by each membrane fouling component the cake layer resistance accounted for 85 93 of total membrane resistance indicating major fouling mechanism was from the cake layer fig 5 a correspondingly virus rejection by cake layer in the total virus rejection made up 54 11 suggesting that the greatest contributor to total virus rejection was provided by the cake layer fig 5b however chaudhry et al 2015b revealed that backwashed membrane was the main contributor to total virus removal in a full scale mbr with a nominal pore size of 0 04 μm the membrane pore size in chaudhry s study was very similar to the target viruses whereas the membrane pore size in our study was about 10 times larger than the virus size the smaller membrane pore size enhances the contribution of the backwashed membrane to virus rejection because the membrane with smaller pore size is better to reject virus by sieving effect wu et al 2017 zhu et al 2021 additionally the relative contribution of the cake layer formed after only 5 days of backwashing was studied in chaudhry s study nevertheless the cake layer derived from more serious cake layer fouling thus improving the contribution of the cake layer to the virus rejection in overall virus reject in our study the differences in membrane pore size and cake layer state cause the changes in the relative contribution of each membrane fouling component to reject viruses the specific virus rejection expressed by virus rejection per membrane resistance is shown in fig 5c the specific virus rejection of organic pore blocking resistance was 22 70 lrv r org followed by inorganic pore blocking of 14 58 lrv r inorg while specific virus rejection of cake layer resistance was the smallest and only 2 09 lrv rc the pore blocking fouling is more beneficial to improve virus rejection of membrane than cake layer fouling chen et al 2017 reported that pore blocking accounted for the majority of the total resistances at a low organic loading rate olr whereas the cake layer accounted for the majority of the total resistance at high olrs thus virus rejection rate of the membrane in anmbr operating with a low olr was higher than that with a high olr in the same membrane fouling state due to progressed pore blocking fouling low olr may be more favorable to balance high virus removal efficiency and permeate flux by impacting the membrane resistance distribution 3 5 mechanism of fouled membrane to virus rejection fig 6 provides the ms2 mass balances of the anmbr at the slow fouling stage and the rapid fouling stage respectively foulants enhance virus rejection of membrane by adsorption and electrostatic repulsion between virus and foulants as well as sieving effect lu et al 2013 adsorption between virus and fouling layer rise to an increase in virus content on the membrane while sieving effect and electrostatic repulsion between virus and fouling layer led to virus content increase in the mixed liquor in the slow fouling stage the ms2 proportion in the mixed liquor and the fouling layer was 0 74 and 52 03 respectively and in the rapid fouling stage they were 21 52 and 15 04 respectively the virus distribution changes implied that the primary mechanism of virus rejection by membrane was virus adsorption on the membrane in the slow fouling stage while the sieving effect and electrostatic repulsion were the main reason in the rapid fouling stage which might be attributable to the changes in the fouling state and associated microbial extracellular polymers in addition significant permeate flux decrease as the result of membrane fouling during the rapid fouling stage which indicated that the size sieving effect may be the dominant mechanism of enhanced virus rejection by the fouled membrane in the rapid fouling stage sewage was fed into anmbr and the virus was adsorbed or rejected in the mixed liquor viruses intercepted in the bioreactor were inactivated by predation enzymatic breakdown and environmental stress although there was no obvious difference in virus inactivation rate between the slow fouling stage and the rapid fouling stage the amount of inactivated virus in the rapid stage was higher than in the slow fouling stage because of higher virus concentration in the rapid fouling stage moreover the proportion of virus inactivation was always high in both the slow fouling stage and the rapid fouling stage which means that viruses intercepted in the bioreactor were inactivated with long srt the long srt of anmbr can achieve the goal of reducing the total virus amount including effluent and sludge released into the environment whereas for the aerobic mbr rapid sludge growth results in short srt and viruses on sludge in the bioreactor may enter the environment through sludge discharge 3 6 contributions of biomass adsorption and membrane rejection to virus removal the membrane rejection and biomass adsorption at the initial tmp jump and end of the time course of anmbr operation were analyzed to understand the role of membrane rejection and biomass adsorption fig 7 when tmp was 5 0 kpa and 8 0 kpa which corresponds to the initial and tmp jump respectively the lrvb was 0 2 and 0 25 the lrvm was 0 31 and 1 65 respectively the lrvb was comparable to lrvm in the initial stage of membrane fouling and membrane rejection was much higher than biomass adsorption after the slow fouling stage when tmp was 30 kpa that is at the end of the time course of anmbr the contribution of virus rejection of membrane including pristine membrane irreversible fouling organic pore blocking inorganic pore blocking cake layer formation cake layer compression was much higher than that of biomass adsorption by calculation the lrvs of ms2 rejection by the pristine membrane irreversible fouling organic pore blocking inorganic pore blocking cake layer formation cake layer compression were 0 25 0 32 0 55 0 24 0 32 1 33 respectively the cake layer compression is the most important factor for improving virus removal by membrane fouling in the pilot scale anmbr the membrane fouling caused by the cake layer compression was mitigated by periodic backwashing and lvranmbr decreased to 2 27 logs immediately after backwashing performance and then increased till the next backwashing nevertheless the lvranmbr after backwashing was still higher than that of conventional activated sludge processes prado et al 2019 considering the increasing demand for water reuse safety appropriate measures should be taken to improve virus removal of anmbr especially after backwashing fortunately operational practices such as coagulation pretreatment are likely to enhance virus removal of anmbr after backwashing by promoting viral agglomeration in sewage lee et al 2017 4 conclusion virus removal by anmbr treating sewage was up to 3 6 logs the significant correlation between virus removal and membrane fouling especially in the stage of rapid fouling indicated that membrane fouling was the key factor in the virus removal by anmbr aggravated membrane fouling leads to an increase in the virus concentration in the mixed liquor which is related to the increase of suspended solid and metabolites the long srt of anmbr can achieve the goal of reducing the total virus amount released into the environment the cake layer was the main contributor to virus rejection in anmbr while the greatest resistance specific virus rejection was provided by organic pore blocking in the slow fouling stage the primary mechanism of virus rejection was adsorption on the membrane while the sieving effect could be the dominant

16321,reduction of soluble cr vi into insoluble cr iii by iron sulfide fes minerals under anoxic conditions has been widely observed in natural and engineered systems yet information has been lacking on the fes mediated oxidation and remobilization potential of cr iii under varying environmental conditions the objective of this study was to investigate fes mediated redox transformation of cr iii to cr vi and the associated mobilization and immobilization when cr iii fes systems are exposed to atmospheric conditions the results showed that fes nanoparticles facilitated rapid and strong fenton like reactions during the early stage oxygenation of fes resulting in rapid production of hydroxyl radicals oh consequently cr iii was rapidly oxidized into cr vi yet as the reactions proceeded the oxidative potential was counteracted by competitive scavenging of oh by fe ii and s ii from fes and the reduction reactions by these electron donors at equilibrium all cr vi was reduced back to cr iii at an fes cr iii molar ratio of 10 1 while a small fraction of cr vi persisted in solid products of cr oh 3 s at an fes cr iii molar ratio of 1 1 acidic conditions favored the generation of cr vi and the equilibrium concentration of cr vi in oxic fes nps systems at ph 5 0 was 1 7 times higher than at ph 9 0 overall the fes induced fenton like reactions and the oxidation of cr iii were favored in the early stage but quenched in the later stage and outcompeted by the reduction of cr vi if sufficient fes was available the findings provide new insights into the hydrochemical processes that can affect the speciation toxicity and mobility of cr in aquatic systems containing fes and cr graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords groundwater remediation iron sulfide chromium

reductively remove or transform contaminants in groundwater and soil such as hexavalent chromium cr vi gong et al 2016 tian et al 2020 wang et al 2019 fes nps can supply fe ii and s ii species and

some redox active contaminants are often present in their reduced states e g arsenic as as iii and chromium as cr iii on the other hand oxygen can intrude groundwater during groundwater extraction or through other anthropogenic and natural processes chen et al 2019 kumar and riyazuddin 2012 which can turn the groundwater system into an oxidizing environment cr iii is the predominant species of cr in the natural environments which is less soluble less mobile and less toxic than cr vi rai eary and zachara 1989 in natural groundwater cr iii may exist in the form of free ions organic complexes and low solubility hydroxide precipitates gorny et al 2016 rai et al 1989 however when exposed to o2 or in the presence of manganese oxides cr iii can be oxidized to cr vi eary and rai 1987 namgung et al 2014 pan et al 2017 manganese oxides can oxidize both aqueous and solid phase cr iii species rapidly and effectively eary and rai 1987 namgung et al 2014 pan et al 2017 however the oxidation of cr iii by o2 is much slower than that by manganese oxides namgung et al 2014 the oxidation of cr iii to cr vi by such oxidizing reagents has been widely known whereas limited knowledge is available on the conversion of cr or other redox active species in the presence of natural or engineered fes minerals particles despite their broad presence in the environment engineered fes nps have been widely studied for reductive sequestration of some redox sensitive contaminants such as cr vi wang et al 2019 in such treatment systems dissolved oxygen do is often avoided due to 1 do competes with the target contaminants for the electrons and subsequently inhibits the reduction efficiency li et al 2016 liu et al 2015 wang et al 2019 and 2 do can re oxidize the reduced products and remobilize the

have observed that oh in oxic fes systems is able to oxidize as iii to as v to degrade trichloroethylene and phenol and to trigger the remobilization of cadmium cheng et al 2016 2020 huang et al 2021 jeong et al 2010 nevertheless there has been no information on the speciation of cr in oxic fes systems despite its important environmental implications in both natural and engineered systems 1 2 fe

were to 1 investigate the conversion between cr iii and cr vi when exposed to engineered fes nps and under oxic conditions 2 explore the effects of ph and fes to cr iii molar ratio on the fes mediated cr conversion 3 identify the dominant reactive species responsible for the oxidation of cr iii and 4 elucidate the underlying mechanisms in the oxygenated fes system 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all chemicals were of analytical grade or higher text s1 in the supporting information si provides more information about the chemicals nano scale fes particles were prepared following the homogeneous precipitation method detailed in text s2 liu et al 2008 cr oh 3 s and crxfe1 x oh 3 s were prepared following the methods by huang et al 2016 and papassiopi et al 2014 respectively text s3 the resulting cr oh 3 was confirmed to be mainly cr oh 3 3h2o by x ray diffraction xrd analysis fig s1a and the value of ph point of zero charge pzc of cr oh 3 was 7 16 fig s1b the synthetic crxfe1 x oh 3 was verified through elemental analysis first 1 g of the material was dissolved in 50 ml of 1 m hcl by shaking the mixture for 24 h the dissolved cr and fe were then determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry the cr to fe molar ratio was 3 02 which agreed with that in cr0 75fe0 25 oh 3 a common product of cr vi reduction by fe ii bearing materials sedlak and chan 1997 wang et al 2019 2 2 batch cr iii oxidation experiments all the batch tests were conducted at 25 2 c in a 1 l five neck reactor filled with 500 ml of a cr iii solution 1 14 mm cr oh 3 and crxfe1 x oh 3 were chosen as the model cr iii species to represent natural or engineeringly reduced cr the reactor was open to the atmosphere but enwrapped with aluminum foil to avoid potential photochemical reactions in addition the reactor housed two separate glass tubes for adding 0 05 m hcl and 0 05 m naoh solutions to automatically adjust the solution ph through a gs 02 ph intelligent ph control system which included a ph probe and a do probe fig s2 shows the experimental setup the batch kinetic tests were initiated by adding a known mass of the fes nps into 500 ml of the cr iii solutions under stirring at 1000 rpm using a teflon coated magnetic stirring bar the initial do in the solution was nearly zero by sparging the solution with nitrogen gas 99 999 pure for 60 min however the system was then exposed to the atmospheric conditions upon the addition of fes nps with the final concentration of 1 0 g l 1 the solution ph values of 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 were chosen to represent the typical environmental conditions of natural waters the change in ph was within 0 2 units during the reactions the total amounts of hcl added at ph 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 were 10 3 7 6 and 3 9 ml respectively during the oxidation of cr iii corresponding to the cl concentrations of 1 03 0 76 and 0 39 mm respectively at predetermined times samples were drawn and filtered immediately through a 0 22 μm membrane of mixed cellulose esters the filtrates were then analyzed for cr vi and total cr at the same time aqueous fe ii was determined in oxic fes nps systems in the presence and absence of cr oh 3 s to investigate the effect of fes to cr iii molar ratio the initial fes to cr iii molar ratios were 1 1 5 1 10 1 corresponding to 0 1 0 5 and 1 0 g l 1 of fes respectively for comparison the experiments were also carried out under anoxic conditions with continuous nitrogen sparging and control tests without fes nps were conducted under otherwise identical conditions 2 3 generation of h2o2 and oh in the oxic fes system the generation of h2o2 and oh were tested following the same batch experimental procedures except that cr iii was replaced with 10 mm benzoic acid ba ba served as a probe chemical for measuring oh cheng et al 2016 joo et al 2005 qiu et al 2018 at pre determined times aqueous samples were filtered through a 0 22 μm nylon filter and the filtrates were analyzed for h2o2 and p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba the reaction product between oh and ba to determine the p hba concentration 1 ml of the filtrate was rapidly mixed with 1 ml of methanol hplc grade to quench any ongoing oxidation caused by oh in addition the cumulative concentrations of oh were also measured in the presence of cr iii in the oxygenated fes system 2 4 chemical analyses and material characterizations cr vi and total cr in the solution were measured via diphenylhydrazine spectrophotometry and flame atomic absorption spectrometry respectively cr vi in the solid phase was measured through diphenylhydrazine spectrophotometry after acid digestion in brief the solid product from the oxidation of cr oh 3 s was dissolved in 3 m hcl at a solid to liquid ratio of 1 g 50 ml by shaking the mixture for 24 h cr vi in the digested solution was then determined after the addition of 0 5 ml phosphoric acid to eliminate the interference of fe iii consequently total cr vi was calculated as the sum of aqueous cr vi and solid phase cr vi and aqueous cr iii was determined by the difference between total dissolved cr and cr vi aqueous fe ii was measured through o phenanthroline spectrophotometry p hba was determined using a waters 8417 liquid chromatograph with isocratic elution using acetonitrile and 0 1 trifluoroacetic acid 40 60 v v at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 the detection wavelength was 255 nm cheng et al 2016 joo et al 2005 the cumulative concentration of oh was calculated to be 5 87 times that of p hba joo et al 2005 h2o2 was determined using a uv vis spectrophotometer at 551 nm following a modified n n diethyl p phenylendiamine method text s4 katsoyiannis ruettimann and hug 2008 the solution do was measured using a mettler seven2go do meter text s5 gives detailed methods about the material characterizations 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of fes nps fig s3 shows the property analysis of the prepared fes nps the material was verified to be fes by xrd fig s3a the high resolution fe 2p spectrum in fig s3b confirmed the presence of fe ii at 710 7 and 712 4 ev and fe iii at 724 7 ev wang et al 2020 wu et al 2016 indicating that the surface of fes was partially oxidized the high resolution s 2p spectrum in fig s3c indicated that s appeared as sulfide at 160 5 and 161 5 ev as well as polysulfide at 162 7 ev jeong et al 2010 wang et al 2019 based on the comparison of the intensity the fe and s on the surface of fes mainly existed in the form of fe ii and s ii respectively the scanning electron microscopy sem image showed that the particle size of fes was below 100 nm and the energy dispersive spectroscopy eds data revealed that the mass fractions of fe and s were 65 5 and 34 5 on the surface of the fresh fes nps respectively i e the molar ratio of fe to s was close to 1 1 fig s3d the hydrodynamic diameter of fes ranged from 200 to 850 nm with a mean diameter of 480 7 nm fig s3e the phpzc value of the prepared fes nps was 4 09 fig s3f 3 2 oxidation of cr iii to cr vi fig s4 shows the evolution of the do level when the n2 purged systems containing cr iii and fes nps were exposed to air and figs 1 a and 1b show the generation of aqueous cr vi in all cases the do level surged rapidly to 4 0 mg l 1 in 30 min and recovered to its equilibrium level of 8 0 mg l 1 after 480 min regardless of the ph levels 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 fig s4 for the case of cr oh 3 s fig 1a aqueous cr vi rapidly rose to a peak value of 6 51 µm at 60 min 7 03 µm at 30 min and 7 96 µm at 60 min at the three ph values respectively subsequently however the cr vi concentration gradually decreased to below the detection limit after 240 60 and 1920 min respectively similar concentration profiles were observed for the case of crxfe1 x oh 3 s although the peak cr vi values were much lower 0 22 2 28 and 3 08 μm after 5 min respectively at ph 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 fig 1b which agrees with the notion that crxfe1 x oh 3 s is chemically more stable than cr oh 3 s hausladen and fendorf 2017 cr oh 3 s was used in the subsequent experiments considering the easier oxidation of cr oh 3 s than crxfe1 x oh 3 s and the similar variation trends in the aqueous cr vi concentrations in the presence of cr oh 3 s and crxfe1 x oh 3 s the peaking profiles of cr vi indicate that competing processes were taking place in the systems on the one hand the solid phase cr iii was oxidatively dissolved into aqueous cr vi under the increasingly oxic conditions on the other hand the resulting hcro4 and or cro4 2 was adsorbed on the fes nps and their oxidized products such as fe oxyhr oxides jeong et al 2010 wang et al 2019 wu et al 2016 moreover cr vi can also be reduced by fe ii and s ii from the fes wang et al 2019 see section 3 5 2 the initial increase in cr vi indicates that the oxidative conversion of cr iii into cr vi was faster initially which was outweighed subsequently when the adsorption and reduction of cr vi surpassed the oxidation of cr iii to cr vi the peaking and tailing profiles appeared highly ph dependent section 3 3 presents more details on the ph effects 3 3 effects of ph on fes mediated oxidative dissolution of cr iii figs 1a and 1c show the effects of ph on the concentration histories of aqueous cr vi and total dissolved cr i e dissolved cr vi cr iii in oxic fes nps systems with cr oh 3 s at ph 5 0 fig 1a aqueous cr vi emerged after 30 min increased rapidly to its peak value of 6 51 μm at 60 min and then gradually decreased to below the detection limit at 240 min meanwhile the total soluble cr decreased rapidly from the initial 8 99 µm to undetectable within 10 min but then surged to its peak value of 8 54 μm at 60 min and then dropped to an undetectable level at 240 min in concert with the cr vi peaking profile fig 1c while the peak value of total cr slightly exceeded that of cr vi the two concentration lines merged after 120 min indicating that all soluble cr was present as cr vi at ph 7 0 and 9 0 the aqueous cr vi and total soluble cr overlapped throughout the experiments indicating no soluble cr iii was present in addition the peaking profile at ph 9 0 displayed a much longer tailing period than at ph 7 0 figs 1a and 1c suggesting that the alkaline ph retarded the adsorption and or reduction of cr vi in the oxic fes system at ph 7 0 aqueous cr vi and total soluble cr emerged at 10 min and increased to their peak values of 7 03 and 7 10 μm at 30 min respectively and subsequently dropped to undetectable within 60 min at ph 9 0 both cr vi and total soluble cr appeared in the solution at 10 min increased to the peak values of 7 96 and 8 02 μm at 60 min respectively and then became undetectable at 1920 min while the peak values of aqueous cr vi were comparable at the three ph levels all the cr vi including both aqueous cr vi and solid phase cr vi generated in the oxic fes systems were reduced back to cr iii and became undetectable at the equilibrium table s1 to understand the solid phase speciation of cr the solid particles during the fes mediated oxidation reduction of cr oh 3 s were subjected to the xps analysis fig 2 the high resolution spectrum of the pristine cr oh 3 s confirmed that cr on the surface was mainly present as cr iii fig 2a table 1 and text s6 however at the peaking of aqueous cr vi or after 60 min at ph 5 0 30 min at ph 7 0 and 60 min at ph 9 0 of the oxidation dominant stage cr iii and cr vi were found to co exist figs 2b d table 1 and text s6 though the relative percentiles of cr iii and cr vi varied with ph namely 48 0 and 52 0 at ph 5 0 65 2 and 34 8 at ph 7 0 and 62 4 and 37 6 at ph 9 0 fig 2h however after the reaction equilibrium 2480 min all cr vi on the solid was reduced back to cr iii at all the three ph levels figs 2e h table 1 and text s6 namely the reduction reaction eventually took over in the oxic fes systems similar results were also observed for the case of crxfe1 x oh 3 s fig s5 and text s7 fes nps as a reductant can supply both fe ii and s ii species which reduce cr vi to cr iii wang et al 2019 while the kinetic data indicate that the oxidation of cr iii and the reduction of cr vi were taking place competitively in the systems the reduction potential which is dependent of the amount of electron donors fes dosage outweighed that of the oxidation potential in the later stage section 3 5 2 it is noteworthy that the reductive species of fe ii and or s ii were detected even at the peak concentrations of aqueous cr vi fig s6 and text s8 which however were also oxidized into fe iii s0 and so4 2 at the equilibrium state fig s7 and text s8 both fes nps and the oxidized fe hydr oxides have been known to adsorb cr vi fig s8 eqs 7 10 depict the relevant redox reactions

fes to cr iii molar ratios on cr iii oxidation evidently fes strongly impacted the cr speciation in the oxic fes cr iii systems as such the dosage of fes or the fes to cr iii molar ratio would affect the redox transformation of cr fes at the levels from 1 0 10 4 to 12 4 mm is widespread in the natural environment jørgensen 1977 wilkin and barnes 1997 and elevated levels fes nps could be presented in engineered systems as such the fes mediated redox reactions of cr were investigated at various fes to cr iii molar ratios fig 3 shows the concentration histories of aqueous cr vi in the oxic fes systems at three fes to cr iii molar ratios 1 1 5 1 and 10 1 and at ph 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 aqueous cr vi appeared and increased rapidly in the initial stages before finally decreasing to below the detection limit as do increased to the final concentration of 8 0 mg l 1 fig s9 notably the peak concentration and duration of cr vi in the solution increased remarkably with increasing fes to cr iii molar ratio at ph 5 0 the peak values of aqueous cr vi at the three ratios 1 1 5 1 or 10 1 were 0 14 μm at 15 min 1 33 μm at 30 min and 6 51 μm at 60 min respectively at ph 7 0 0 39 μm at 10 min 1 72 μm at 30 min and 7 03 μm at 30 min and at ph 9 0 1 42 μm at 30 min 3 24 μm at 60 min and 7 96 μm at 60 min the results indicate that while increasing the fes dosage appeared to render the systems thermodynamically more favorable to the reduction of cr vi the initial generation of the reactive oxygen species section 3 5 2 and the resulting oxidation of cr iii were kinetically faster before the peak cr vi concentration was reached as the high fes to cr iii molar ratio can occur in both natural and engineered systems the fes mediated oxidation of the solid phase cr iii may substantially increase the release or remobilization of toxic cr vi into the environment fig 4 shows the xps spectra of cr 2p which indicates the cr speciation and the relative surface contents of cr iii and cr vi upon the oxidation of cr oh 3 s at an fes to cr iii molar ratio of 1 1 at the peak aqueous cr vi the surface contents of cr vi at ph 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 were 31 7 14 1 and 18 1 respectively figs 4a e 4g i and text s9 which are lower than the corresponding values 48 0 34 8 and 37 6 at an fes to cr iii molar ratio of 10 1 fig 2h confirming that the presence of fes was responsible for the initial stronger oxidation at the final equilibrium state all surface cr vi was reduced back to cr iii at the fes to cr iii molar ratio of 10 1 fig 2h conversely 16 4 6 6 and 7 6 of cr on the surface remained as cr vi at ph values of 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 respectively figs 4d i and text s9 at the equilibrium of the oxidation of cr oh 3 s the total amounts of cr vi were 0 60 μm at ph 5 0 0 27 μm at ph 7 0 and 0 35 μm at ph 9 0 corresponding to the fraction of cr iii oxidized of 0 52 0 23 and 0 31 table s1 this observation indicates that the presence of sufficient fes would eventually counteract the initial oxidation process in a closed system and keep cr iii in the stable state while the presence of insufficient fes may result in notable cr vi persisting in the systems the xps data also revealed that the main oxidation products of fes were fe iii bearing hydro oxides s0 and so4 2 fig s10 and text s10 mass balance measurements also indicated that at equilibrium all cr vi was adsorbed on the fe hydro oxides table s1 which agrees with the literatures jeong et al 2010 wang et al 2020 wu et al 2016 3 5 roles of reactive species 3 5 1 reactive species responsible for oxidation of cr iii in the absence of do no aqueous cr vi was detected in the fes cr oh 3 s suspensions in addition in the absence of fes do oxidized insignificantly cr oh 3 s at the end of the experiments within 2480 min table s1 which agrees with the report that the oxidation rate of cr iii by do is very slow dai et al 2010 namgung et al 2014 therefore the oxidation of cr iii to cr vi in the oxic fes systems must be induced by other reactive species generated from the oxygenation of fes researchers have observed that oh fe iv h2o2 and fe iii may be generated in oxic fes systems and may render oxidative transformations of various contaminants bi et al 2016 cheng et al 2016 2020 jeong et al 2010 for instance transient fe iii species were considered responsible for the oxidation of u iv to u vi by do in the presence of fes bi et al 2016 and oh and fe iv during the oxygenation of fes were found likely accountable for the oxidation of as iii to as v jeong et al 2010 h2o2 and oh in pyrite activated h2o2 systems were able to convert sb iii into sb v kong hu and he 2015 in addition researchers have also noticed that ph can influence the forms of the reactive species and the transformation of cr iii to cr vi in such systems ye et al 2018 reported that h2o2 at ph 3 0 and oh at ph 9 0 in a zvi mediated fenton system were able to oxidize organically bound cr iii to cr vi xue et al 2016 2017 observed that h2o2 and oh radicals can oxidize cr iii to cr vi under alkaline conditions in an electro fenton system ye et al 2017 found that oh generated in a uv activated system oxidized organically bound cr iii to soluble cr vi at ph 2 0 6 0 to evaluate the involvement of h2o2 in the oxidation of cr iii the production of h2o2 from the oxygenation of fes was measured fig 5 a shows the concentration histories of h2o2 during the oxygenation of fes at ph 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 like other fenton processes the lower ph resulted in the greater concentration of h2o2 keenan and sedlak 2008 zhang et al 2020 the initial peak concentrations of h2o2 were 268 8 104 3 and 6 5 μm at ph values of 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 respectively namely the generation of h2o2 was negligible at ph 9 0 in contrast at the acidic and neutral ph h2o2 was detected right after the reaction was initiated but then fluctuated and eventually dropped to below the detection limit after 950 min the fluctuation of h2o2 reflects two contrasting reactions on the one hand h2o2 was generated via the reduction of o2 by the structural fe ii from the fes eq 1 on the other hand h2o2 was decomposed to generate oh eq 2 cheng et al 2016 in addition at acidic ph h2o2 can be produced through the redox reactions between o2 and fe ii from fes at ph 5 0 the initial surge 120 min in the h2o2 concentration was attributed to the direct reduction of o2 by fe ii from fes cheng et al 2016 whereas the second rise resulted from reduction of o2 by green rust formed from fes through solution phase oxidation following the dissolution of fes jeong et al 2010 at ph 9 0 the h2o2 concentration increased for 60 min and then decreased to below the detection limit and the much lower production of h2o2 was likely attributed to surface formation of fe ii and fe iii hydroxides which inhibited the fenton reactions at ph 7 0 the h2o2 concentration remained at a plateau with less bumpy fluctuation before it was completely consumed decomposed which was probably attributed to solution phase oxidation of dissolved fe ii following fes dissolution along with surface mediated oxidation of fes jeong et al 2010 tian et al 2020 at equilibrium the h2o2 decomposition reaction became predominant and no h2o2 was detected after 960 min the peak values of h2o2 during the oxygenation of fes were chosen as the initial concentrations of h2o2 used in the reaction of cr oh 3 s with h2o2 fig 5b shows that h2o2 alone was not effective in the oxidation of cr oh 3 s aqueous cr vi was not observed at ph 7 0 or 9 0 and 0 4 µm of cr vi was detected at ph 5 0 no evidence was observed that transient fe iii species were involved in the oxidation of cr iii sedlak and chan 1997 which is consistent with typical fenton processes to evaluate the contributions of oh and fe iv the cr iii oxidation experiments were carried out in the presence of 10 mm methanol 2 mm tert butanol or 1 mm ba methanol can quench many reactive oxidants including ros and fe iv whereas ba is an effective scavenger of oh and tert butanol can scavenge both fe iv and oh cheng et al 2016 qiu et al 2018 yamazaki and piette 1991 figs 5c and 5d show that the generation of aqueous cr vi was ceased in the presence of methanol indicating that ros or fe iv was responsible for the transformation of cr iii to cr vi meanwhile the presence of tert butanol remarkably decreased the production of aqueous cr vi indicating that fe iv and or oh might be the primary oxidant of cr iii furthermore the presence of ba completely quenched the reaction which indicates that oh was the primary ros accounting for the transformation of cr iii to cr vi 3 5 2 oh generation fig 6 shows the production of oh during the oxygenation of fes in the absence or presence of cr oh 3 s after an initial lag of oh production oh rapidly increased and gradually decreased in accord with typical fenton reactions the generation of oh was favored at acidic ph zhang et al 2020 with the final cumulative oh concentrations being 91 70 29 60 and 14 79 μm at ph 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 respectively fig 6a accordingly higher do concentrations were observed at higher ph fig s11a and more do was consumed at the acidic ph due to the formation of oh radicals during the oxygenation of fes in addition a lag for production of oh was observed because of the quenching of fes fig s12a which was consistent with the previous work cheng et al 2016 fig 6b shows the cumulative oh generation in the presence of cr iii at the three ph levels ba was used as a probe chemical to measure oh produced cheng et al 2016 joo et al 2005 qiu et al 2018 organic acids containing carboxyl groups are capable of dissolving cr iii from cr oh 3 s carbonaro et al 2008 control tests indicated that the presence of 1 mm ba showed no significant effect on the dissolution of cr oh 3 s fig s13 the cumulative oh increased and then reached a plateau with do increasing to a final concentration of 8 0 mg l 1 figs 6b and s11b compared to the control systems fig 6a the final cumulative oh concentrations were lowered by a factor of 2 8 and 3 6 times at ph 5 0 and 7 0 respectively however the cumulative concentration of oh was nearly the same as in the control system at ph 9 0 the apparently lower cumulative concentrations of oh under acidic and neutral conditions in the presence of cr oh 3 s can thus be ascribed to the stronger competition of cr iii and fes with ba in scavenging oh in an undersaturated system cr oh 3 s undergoes the following dissolution eq 11 11 cr oh 3 s 3 h cr iii aq 3 h2o k sp 6 3 10 31 the proton promoted dissolution is favored at acidic ph at ph 5 0 aqueous cr iii exists predominantly as croh2 rai eary and zachara 1989 which can be adsorbed onto the negatively charged surface of the fes nps phpzc 4 09 fig s3f this was partially confirmed by the rapid disappearance of the aqueous cr iii from its initial value of 8 99 μm upon the addition of fes nps fig 1c at ph 7 0 the cr oh 3 s particles phpzc 7 16 were positively charged while the fes nps phpzc 4 09 were negatively charged and they co precipitated due to the electrostatic attraction figs s1b and s3f the adsorption of croh2 or cr oh 3 s on the fes nps would not only shield cr iii from being oxidized due to the fes induced reducing environment figs 5c and 5d but also quench the fes mediated generation of oh at ph 9 0 cr oh 3 s and fes nps are both negatively charged and thus the presence of the former will not retard the fes enabled fenton process in addition fe hydr oxides from the oxidation of fes may accumulate on the fes nps which can also passivate the surface reactivities of fes a close examination of the initial generation of oh in the presence of cr iii during the oxygenation of fes revealed a notable lag time of 5 10 min fig s12b accordingly the appearance of aqueous cr vi also showed an initial lag phase fig 1a the initial adsorption of cr iii at ph 5 0 and 7 0 is both thermodynamically and kinetically favorable the adsorbed cr iii not only hinders the fes facilitated generation of oh but also renders more oh consumed by the competing electron donors fe ii and s ii from the fes at ph 9 0 more oh was used for the oxidation of cr iii and thus the lag in the formation of oh could be due to the competitive scavenging of oh by fe ii and s ii on the surface of fes cheng et al 2016 following the initial lag phase both aqueous cr vi and cr vi on the solid surface sharply increased figs 1 4 which is ascribed to rapid generation of oh from the oxygenation of fes figs 6b and s12b the concentrations of oh in the presence of cr oh 3 s at ph 5 0 and 7 0 were 15 65 μm at 60 min and 5 12 μm at 30 min corresponding to 48 6 and 62 5 of the final commutative yields respectively at ph 9 0 when the aqueous cr vi reached its peak at 60 min the oh concentration reached 8 84 μm 61 4 of the final total yield figs 6b and s12b in the initial stage the production rate of oh outweighed the radical scavenging rate and accordingly the oxidation rate of cr iii outcompeted the reduction rate of cr vi resulting in the accumulation of cr vi as the reaction proceeded to equilibrium the yield of oh gradually plateaued fig 6b and the reduction rate of cr vi outcompeted the production rate leading to the decrease in cr vi figs 1 4 eventually cr vi was reduced to cr iii in the presence of sufficient fe ii and or s ii eqs 7 10 mamun et al 2018 wang et al 2019 2020 and the final amount of residual cr vi in the systems depends on the fes to cr iii molar ratio fig 4 and table s1 in addition compared with those in the absence of cr iii changes of aqueous fe ii concentrations in the presence of cr iii also confirmed that cr iii can be oxidized by oh to cr vi initially followed with the reduction of the newly generated cr vi during the oxygenation of fes fig s14 3 5 3 mechanism of fes mediated oxidation of cr iii taken together the experimental findings the fes mediated oxidation of cr iii was controlled by the kinetics of complex redox reactions occurring concurrently in the oxic fes nps systems fig 7 shows the proposed reaction mechanism first oh was generated through the fenton like reactions through activation of o2 by fe ii from the fes eqs 1 and 2 cheng et al 2016 the initial rapid generation of oh resulted in rapid oxidation of cr iii into cr vi per the following reaction eq 12 xue et al 2016 12 cr iii 3 oh 3 oh cr vi conversely the oxidation is counteracted by the competitive scavenging of oh by fe ii and s ii from fes and by the reduction reaction by these electron donors eqs 7 10 in addition depending on the system ph the redox reactions may be affected by some other adsorption and surface passivation processes at acidic or neutral ph aqueous cr iii and cr oh 3 s are subject to adsorption on a negatively charged fes surface it is unfavorable for adsorbed cr iii species to be oxidized due to the local strong reducing environment on the fes surface at alkaline ph the adsorption of cr oh 3 s becomes unfavorable due to the electrostatic repulsion between the like charged surfaces figs s1b and s3f in addition aqueous cr iii becomes negligible due to the decreased solubility of cr iii rai eary and zachara 1989 moreover the surface precipitation of fe hydr oxides on fes may retard the reactivity of the fes in the early stage the rates of the fenton like reactions and the associated oxidation of cr iii by oh were faster than the reduction rate of the resulting cr vi namely fe ii were preferentially used in the fenton like reactions as a result the higher fes to cr iii molar ratio the higher the yield of oh and the more generation of cr vi figs 1 6 the acidic ph favored the generation of oh due to more favorable conditions for the fenton reactions after the initial peaking the generation of oh and cr vi dropped because of the elevated scavenging effect as more fe ii and s ii became available in the system meanwhile the reduction rate of cr vi exceeded the generation rate eqs 8 10 wang et al 2019 patterson et al 1997 wang et al 2020 at a higher fes to cr iii molar ratio e g 10 1 the resulting cr vi was completely reduced to cr iii which remained stable thereafter conversely at a lower fes to cr iii molar ratio e g 1 1 a fraction of the cr vi was adsorbed on the oxidation products of fes and remained in the system fig 4 and table s1 4 conclusions this work investigated the redox speciation of solid cr iii species in the presence of fes nps under oxic conditions rapid initial transformation of cr iii to cr vi was found upon oxygenation of fes which was jointly controlled by the oxidation of cr iii to cr vi and the reduction of the newly generated cr vi during the initial oxygenation of fes oh was rapidly generated through the fes mediated fenton like reactions and acted as the predominant reactive species for the oxidation of cr iii to cr vi resulting in rapid accumulation of cr vi as the process proceeded the oxidation of cr iii was counteracted by the competitive scavenging of oh by fe ii and s ii from fes and by the reduction reaction by these electron donors in the presence of sufficient fes in the system cr vi was eventually reduced back to cr iii by fe ii and or s ii and the resulting cr iii may remain stable over prolonged period of time due to the protective role of fes acidic conditions and higher molar ratio of fes to cr iii might favor the initial generation of cr vi at equilibrium a small fraction of cr vi persisted on the surface of the solid oxidation products of fes at lower fes cr iii molar ratios e g 1 1 while all cr vi was reduced back to cr iii at elevated fes cr iii molar ratios e g 10 1 the findings provide some new insights into the redox transformation of cr in natural and engineered aquatic systems containing fes and cr iii when exposed to atmospheric conditions and may aid in controlling the toxic effects of cr in the environment credit authorship contribution statement tao wang investigation writing

16321,reduction of soluble cr vi into insoluble cr iii by iron sulfide fes minerals under anoxic conditions has been widely observed in natural and engineered systems yet information has been lacking on the fes mediated oxidation and remobilization potential of cr iii under varying environmental conditions the objective of this study was to investigate fes mediated redox transformation of cr iii to cr vi and the associated mobilization and immobilization when cr iii fes systems are exposed to atmospheric conditions the results showed that fes nanoparticles facilitated rapid and strong fenton like reactions during the early stage oxygenation of fes resulting in rapid production of hydroxyl radicals oh consequently cr iii was rapidly oxidized into cr vi yet as the reactions proceeded the oxidative potential was counteracted by competitive scavenging of oh by fe ii and s ii from fes and the reduction reactions by these electron donors at equilibrium all cr vi was reduced back to cr iii at an fes cr iii molar ratio of 10 1 while a small fraction of cr vi persisted in solid products of cr oh 3 s at an fes cr iii molar ratio of 1 1 acidic conditions favored the generation of cr vi and the equilibrium concentration of cr vi in oxic fes nps systems at ph 5 0 was 1 7 times higher than at ph 9 0 overall the fes induced fenton like reactions and the oxidation of cr iii were favored in the early stage but quenched in the later stage and outcompeted by the reduction of cr vi if sufficient fes was available the findings provide new insights into the hydrochemical processes that can affect the speciation toxicity and mobility of cr in aquatic systems containing fes and cr graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords groundwater remediation iron sulfide chromium transformation hydroxyl radical redox active contaminant redox reaction 1 introduction iron sulfide fes minerals are widespread in the subsurface environment rickard and luther 2007 under reductive conditions the biological reduction of sulfate and fe iii may lead to the formation of nano scale particles nps of fes rickard and morse 2005 synthetic fes nps have been extensively applied to reductively remove or transform contaminants in groundwater and soil such as hexavalent chromium cr vi gong et al 2016 tian et al 2020 wang et al 2019 fes nps can supply fe ii and s ii species and reduce toxic cr vi to insoluble cr iii which can be precipitated as solid cr oh 3 and crxfe1 x oh 3 wang et al 2019 the subsurface is often oxygen deficient and under a reducing environment as such some redox active contaminants are often present in their reduced states e g arsenic as as iii and chromium as cr iii on the other hand oxygen can intrude groundwater during groundwater extraction or through other anthropogenic and natural processes chen et al 2019 kumar and riyazuddin 2012 which can turn the groundwater system into an oxidizing environment cr iii is the predominant species of cr in the natural environments which is less soluble less mobile and less toxic than cr vi rai eary and zachara 1989 in natural groundwater cr iii may exist in the form of free ions organic complexes and low solubility hydroxide precipitates gorny et al 2016 rai et al 1989 however when exposed to o2 or in the presence of manganese oxides cr iii can be oxidized to cr vi eary and rai 1987 namgung et al 2014 pan et al 2017 manganese oxides can oxidize both aqueous and solid phase cr iii species rapidly and effectively eary and rai 1987 namgung et al 2014 pan et al 2017 however the oxidation of cr iii by o2 is much slower than that by manganese oxides namgung et al 2014 the oxidation of cr iii to cr vi by such oxidizing reagents has been widely known whereas limited knowledge is available on the conversion of cr or other redox active species in the presence of natural or engineered fes minerals particles despite their broad presence in the environment engineered fes nps have been widely studied for reductive sequestration of some redox sensitive contaminants such as cr vi wang et al 2019 in such treatment systems dissolved oxygen do is often avoided due to 1 do competes with the target contaminants for the electrons and subsequently inhibits the reduction efficiency li et al 2016 liu et al 2015 wang et al 2019 and 2 do can re oxidize the reduced products and remobilize the contaminants for instance fes converts cr vi in groundwater into cr oh 3 s and crxfe1 x oh 3 s under reducing conditions wang et al 2019 however information has been limited on the stability of the reduction products i e the re oxidation potential of cr oh 3 s and crxfe1 x oh 3 s when the fes cr iii system is exposed to atmospheric conditions which is commonly found in both engineered and natural systems like zero valent iron zvi fes may act as both an electron donor and mediator of fenton like reactions joo et al 2005 joo and zhao 2008 under oxic conditions reactive oxygen species ros such as hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and hydroxyl radical oh can be produced during the oxygenation of fes through a two electron oxygen reduction reaction orr cheng et al 2016 typically h2o2 is first generated via the two electron reduction of o2 eq 1 and then decomposed by a fenton catalyst leading to the generation of oh eq 2 keenan and sedlak 2008 nosaka and nosaka 2017 as the fenton or fenton like reactions are ph sensitive the yield of oh is higher under acidic conditions keenan and sedlak 2008 zhang et al 2020 the fenton generated oh radicals can oxidize cr iii to cr vi xue et al 2016 2017 for instance ye et al 2018 observed that oh generated in a pyrite activated h2o2 system oxidized organic bound cr iii to cr vi at an initial ph between 3 0 and 9 0 the standard redox potentials of oh e0 oh h2o 2 80 v and h2o2 e0 h2o2 h2o 1 76 v are higher than those of chromate species e0 cro4 2 cr oh 3 s 0 13 v e0 hcro4 cr3 1 35 v bard and faulkner 2001 the redox reactions of cr iii with h2o2 and oh are thus thermodynamically favored eqs 3 6 lide 2003 however information has been lacking on the oxidation of cr iii by h2o2 and or oh and the effects of ph in oxic fes systems researchers have observed that oh in oxic fes systems is able to oxidize as iii to as v to degrade trichloroethylene and phenol and to trigger the remobilization of cadmium cheng et al 2016 2020 huang et al 2021 jeong et al 2010 nevertheless there has been no information on the speciation of cr in oxic fes systems despite its important environmental implications in both natural and engineered systems 1 2 fe

were to 1 investigate the conversion between cr iii and cr vi when exposed to engineered fes nps and under oxic conditions 2 explore the effects of ph and fes to cr iii molar ratio on the fes mediated cr conversion 3 identify the dominant reactive species responsible for the oxidation of cr iii and 4 elucidate the underlying mechanisms in the oxygenated fes system 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all chemicals were of analytical grade or higher text s1 in the supporting information si provides more information about the chemicals nano scale fes particles were prepared following the homogeneous precipitation method detailed in text s2 liu et al 2008 cr oh 3 s and crxfe1 x oh 3 s were prepared following the methods by huang et al 2016 and papassiopi et al 2014 respectively text s3 the resulting cr oh 3 was confirmed to be mainly cr oh 3 3h2o by x ray diffraction xrd analysis fig s1a and the value of ph point of zero charge pzc of cr oh 3 was 7 16 fig s1b the synthetic crxfe1 x oh 3 was verified through elemental analysis first 1 g of the material was dissolved in 50 ml of 1 m hcl by shaking the mixture for 24 h the dissolved cr and fe were then determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry the cr to fe molar ratio was 3 02 which agreed with that in cr0 75fe0 25 oh 3 a common product of cr vi reduction by fe ii bearing materials sedlak and chan 1997 wang et al 2019 2 2 batch cr iii oxidation experiments all the batch tests were conducted at 25 2 c in a 1 l five neck reactor filled with 500 ml of a cr iii solution 1 14 mm cr oh 3 and crxfe1 x oh 3 were chosen as the model cr iii species to represent natural or engineeringly reduced cr the reactor was open to the atmosphere but enwrapped with aluminum foil to avoid potential photochemical reactions in addition the reactor housed two separate glass tubes for adding 0 05 m hcl and 0 05 m naoh solutions to automatically adjust the solution ph through a gs 02 ph intelligent ph control system which included a ph probe and a do probe fig s2 shows the experimental setup the batch kinetic tests were initiated by adding a known mass of the fes nps into 500 ml of the cr iii solutions under stirring at 1000 rpm using a teflon coated magnetic stirring bar the initial do in the solution was nearly zero by sparging the solution with nitrogen gas 99 999 pure for 60 min however the system was then exposed to the atmospheric conditions upon the addition of fes nps with the final concentration of 1 0 g l 1 the solution ph values of 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 were chosen to represent the typical environmental conditions of natural waters the change in ph was within 0 2 units during the reactions the total amounts of hcl added at ph 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 were 10 3 7 6 and 3 9 ml respectively during the oxidation of cr iii corresponding to the cl concentrations of 1 03 0 76 and 0 39 mm respectively at predetermined times samples were drawn and filtered immediately through a 0 22 μm membrane of mixed cellulose esters the filtrates were then analyzed for cr vi and total cr at the same time aqueous fe ii was determined in oxic fes nps systems in the presence and absence of cr oh 3 s to investigate the effect of fes to cr iii molar ratio the initial fes to cr iii molar ratios were 1 1 5 1 10 1 corresponding to 0 1 0 5 and 1 0 g l 1 of fes respectively for comparison the experiments were also carried out under anoxic conditions with continuous nitrogen sparging and control tests without fes nps were conducted under otherwise identical conditions 2 3 generation of h2o2 and oh in the oxic fes system the generation of h2o2 and oh were tested following the same batch experimental procedures except that cr iii was replaced with 10 mm benzoic acid ba ba served as a probe chemical for measuring oh cheng et al 2016 joo et al 2005 qiu et al 2018 at pre determined times aqueous samples were filtered through a 0 22 μm nylon filter and the filtrates were analyzed for h2o2 and p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba the reaction product between oh and ba to determine the p hba concentration 1 ml of the filtrate was rapidly mixed with 1 ml of methanol hplc grade to quench any ongoing oxidation caused by oh in addition the cumulative concentrations of oh were also measured in the presence of cr iii in the oxygenated fes system 2 4 chemical analyses and material characterizations cr vi and total cr in the solution were measured via diphenylhydrazine spectrophotometry and flame atomic absorption spectrometry respectively cr vi in the solid phase was measured through diphenylhydrazine spectrophotometry after acid digestion in brief the solid product from the oxidation of cr oh 3 s was dissolved in 3 m hcl at a solid to liquid ratio of 1 g 50 ml by shaking the mixture for 24 h cr vi in the digested solution was then determined after the addition of 0 5 ml phosphoric acid to eliminate the interference of fe iii consequently total cr vi was calculated as the sum of aqueous cr vi and solid phase cr vi and aqueous cr iii was determined by the difference between total dissolved cr and cr vi aqueous fe ii was measured through o phenanthroline spectrophotometry p hba was determined using a waters 8417 liquid chromatograph with isocratic elution using acetonitrile and 0 1 trifluoroacetic acid 40 60 v v at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 the detection wavelength was 255 nm cheng et al 2016 joo et al 2005 the cumulative concentration of oh was calculated to be 5 87 times that of p hba joo et al 2005 h2o2 was determined using a uv vis spectrophotometer at 551 nm following a modified n n diethyl p phenylendiamine method text s4 katsoyiannis ruettimann and hug 2008 the solution do was measured using a mettler seven2go do meter text s5 gives detailed methods about the material characterizations 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of fes nps fig s3 shows the property analysis of the prepared fes nps the material was verified to be fes by xrd fig s3a the high resolution fe 2p spectrum in fig s3b confirmed the presence of fe ii at 710 7 and 712 4 ev and fe iii at 724 7 ev wang et al 2020 wu et al 2016 indicating that the surface of fes was partially oxidized the high resolution s 2p spectrum in fig s3c indicated that s appeared as sulfide at 160 5 and 161 5 ev as well as polysulfide at 162 7 ev jeong et al 2010 wang et al 2019 based on the comparison of the intensity the fe and s on the surface of fes mainly existed in the form of fe ii and s ii respectively the scanning electron microscopy sem image showed that the particle size of fes was below 100 nm and the energy dispersive spectroscopy eds data revealed that the mass fractions of fe and s were 65 5 and 34 5 on the surface of the fresh fes nps respectively i e the molar ratio of fe to s was close to 1 1 fig s3d the hydrodynamic diameter of fes ranged from 200 to 850 nm with a mean diameter of 480 7 nm fig s3e the phpzc value of the prepared fes nps was 4 09 fig s3f 3 2 oxidation of cr iii to cr vi fig s4 shows the evolution of the do level when the n2 purged systems containing cr iii and fes nps were exposed to air and figs 1 a and 1b show the generation of aqueous cr vi in all cases the do level surged rapidly to 4 0 mg l 1 in 30 min and recovered to its equilibrium level of 8 0 mg l 1 after 480 min regardless of the ph levels 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 fig s4 for the case of cr oh 3 s fig 1a aqueous cr vi rapidly rose to a peak value of 6 51 µm at 60 min 7 03 µm at 30 min and 7 96 µm at 60 min at the three ph values respectively subsequently however the cr vi concentration gradually decreased to below the detection limit after 240 60 and 1920 min respectively similar concentration profiles were observed for the case of crxfe1 x oh 3 s although the peak cr vi values were much lower 0 22 2 28 and 3 08 μm after 5 min respectively at ph 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 fig 1b which agrees with the notion that crxfe1 x oh 3 s is chemically more stable than cr oh 3 s hausladen and fendorf 2017 cr oh 3 s was used in the subsequent experiments considering the easier oxidation of cr oh 3 s than crxfe1 x oh 3 s and the similar variation trends in the aqueous cr vi concentrations in the presence of cr oh 3 s and crxfe1 x oh 3 s the peaking profiles of cr vi indicate that competing processes were taking place in the systems on the one hand the solid phase cr iii was oxidatively dissolved into aqueous cr vi under the increasingly oxic conditions on the other hand the resulting hcro4 and or cro4 2 was adsorbed on the fes nps and their oxidized products such as fe oxyhr oxides jeong et al 2010 wang et al 2019 wu et al 2016 moreover cr vi can also be reduced by fe ii and s ii from the fes wang et al 2019 see section 3 5 2 the initial increase in cr vi indicates that the oxidative conversion of cr iii into cr vi was faster initially which was outweighed subsequently when the adsorption and reduction of cr vi surpassed the oxidation of cr iii to cr vi the peaking and tailing profiles appeared highly ph dependent section 3 3 presents more details on the ph effects 3 3 effects of ph on fes mediated oxidative dissolution of cr iii figs 1a and 1c show the effects of ph on the concentration histories of aqueous cr vi and total dissolved cr i e dissolved cr vi cr iii in oxic fes nps systems with cr oh 3 s at ph 5 0 fig 1a aqueous cr vi emerged after 30 min increased rapidly to its peak value of 6 51 μm at 60 min and then gradually decreased to below the detection limit at 240 min meanwhile the total soluble cr decreased rapidly from the initial 8 99 µm to undetectable within 10 min but then surged to its peak value of 8 54 μm at 60 min and then dropped to an undetectable level at 240 min in concert with the cr vi peaking profile fig 1c while the peak value of total cr slightly exceeded that of cr vi the two concentration lines merged after 120 min indicating that all soluble cr was present as cr vi at ph 7 0 and 9 0 the aqueous cr vi and total soluble cr overlapped throughout the experiments indicating no soluble cr iii was present in addition the peaking profile at ph 9 0 displayed a much longer tailing period than at ph 7 0 figs 1a and 1c suggesting that the alkaline ph retarded the adsorption and or reduction of cr vi in the oxic fes system at ph 7 0 aqueous cr vi and total soluble cr emerged at 10 min and increased to their peak values of 7 03 and 7 10 μm at 30 min respectively and subsequently dropped to undetectable within 60 min at ph 9 0 both cr vi and total soluble cr appeared in the solution at 10 min increased to the peak values of 7 96 and 8 02 μm at 60 min respectively and then became undetectable at 1920 min while the peak values of aqueous cr vi were comparable at the three ph levels all the cr vi including both aqueous cr vi and solid phase cr vi generated in the oxic fes systems were reduced back to cr iii and became undetectable at the equilibrium table s1 to understand the solid phase speciation of cr the solid particles during the fes mediated oxidation reduction of cr oh 3 s were subjected to the xps analysis fig 2 the high resolution spectrum of the pristine cr oh 3 s confirmed that cr on the surface was mainly present as cr iii fig 2a table 1 and text s6 however at the peaking of aqueous cr vi or after 60 min at ph 5 0 30 min at ph 7 0 and 60 min at ph 9 0 of the oxidation dominant stage cr iii and cr vi were found to co exist figs 2b d table 1 and text s6 though the relative percentiles of cr iii and cr vi varied with ph namely 48 0 and 52 0 at ph 5 0 65 2 and 34 8 at ph 7 0 and 62 4 and 37 6 at ph 9 0 fig 2h however after the reaction equilibrium 2480 min all cr vi on the solid was reduced back to cr iii at all the three ph levels figs 2e h table 1 and text s6 namely the reduction reaction eventually took over in the oxic fes systems similar results were also observed for the case of crxfe1 x oh 3 s fig s5 and text s7 fes nps as a reductant can supply both fe ii and s ii species which reduce cr vi to cr iii wang et al 2019 while the kinetic data indicate that the oxidation of cr iii and the reduction of cr vi were taking place competitively in the systems the reduction potential which is dependent of the amount of electron donors fes dosage outweighed that of the oxidation potential in the later stage section 3 5 2 it is noteworthy that the reductive species of fe ii and or s ii were detected even at the peak concentrations of aqueous cr vi fig s6 and text s8 which however were also oxidized into fe iii s0 and so4 2 at the equilibrium state fig s7 and text s8 both fes nps and the oxidized fe hydr oxides have been known to adsorb cr vi fig s8 eqs 7 10 depict the relevant redox reactions

fes to cr iii molar ratios on cr iii oxidation evidently fes strongly impacted the cr speciation in the oxic fes cr iii systems as such the dosage of fes or the fes to cr iii molar ratio would affect the redox transformation of cr fes at the levels from 1 0 10 4 to 12 4 mm is widespread in the natural environment jørgensen 1977 wilkin and barnes 1997 and elevated levels fes nps could be presented in engineered systems as such the fes mediated redox reactions of cr were investigated at various fes to cr iii molar ratios fig 3 shows the concentration histories of aqueous cr vi in the oxic fes systems at three fes to cr iii molar ratios 1 1 5 1 and 10 1 and at ph 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 aqueous cr vi appeared and increased rapidly in the initial stages before finally decreasing to below the detection limit as do increased to the final concentration of 8 0 mg l 1 fig s9 notably the peak concentration and duration of cr vi in the solution increased remarkably with increasing fes to cr iii molar ratio at ph 5 0 the peak values of aqueous cr vi at the three ratios 1 1 5 1 or 10 1 were 0 14 μm at 15 min 1 33 μm at 30 min and 6 51 μm at 60 min respectively at ph 7 0 0 39 μm at 10 min 1 72 μm at 30 min and 7 03 μm at 30 min and at ph 9 0 1 42 μm at 30 min 3 24 μm at 60 min and 7 96 μm at 60 min the results indicate that while increasing the fes dosage appeared to render the systems thermodynamically more favorable to the reduction of cr vi the initial generation of the reactive oxygen species section 3 5 2 and the resulting oxidation of cr iii were kinetically faster before the peak cr vi concentration was reached as the high fes to cr iii molar ratio can occur in both natural and engineered systems the fes mediated oxidation of the solid phase cr iii may substantially increase the release or remobilization of toxic cr vi into the environment fig 4 shows the xps spectra of cr 2p which indicates the cr speciation and the relative surface contents of cr iii and cr vi upon the oxidation of cr oh 3 s at an fes to cr iii molar ratio of 1 1 at the peak aqueous cr vi the surface contents of cr vi at ph 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 were 31 7 14 1 and 18 1 respectively figs 4a e 4g i and text s9 which are lower than the corresponding values 48 0 34 8 and 37 6 at an fes to cr iii molar ratio of 10 1 fig 2h confirming that the presence of fes was responsible for the initial stronger oxidation at the final equilibrium state all surface cr vi was reduced back to cr iii at the fes to cr iii molar ratio of 10 1 fig 2h conversely 16 4 6 6 and 7 6 of cr on the surface remained as cr vi at ph values of 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 respectively figs 4d i and text s9 at the equilibrium of the oxidation of cr oh 3 s the total amounts of cr vi were 0 60 μm at ph 5 0 0 27 μm at ph 7 0 and 0 35 μm at ph 9 0 corresponding to the fraction of cr iii oxidized of 0 52 0 23 and 0 31 table s1 this observation indicates that the presence of sufficient fes would eventually counteract the initial oxidation process in a closed system and keep cr iii in the stable state while the presence of insufficient fes may result in notable cr vi persisting in the systems the xps data also revealed that the main oxidation products of fes were fe iii bearing hydro oxides s0 and so4 2 fig s10 and text s10 mass balance measurements also indicated that at equilibrium all cr vi was adsorbed on the fe hydro oxides table s1 which agrees with the literatures jeong et al 2010 wang et al 2020 wu et al 2016 3 5 roles of reactive species 3 5 1 reactive species responsible for oxidation of cr iii in the absence of do no aqueous cr vi was detected in the fes cr oh 3 s suspensions in addition in the absence of fes do oxidized insignificantly cr oh 3 s at the end of the experiments within 2480 min table s1 which agrees with the report that the oxidation rate of cr iii by do is very slow dai et al 2010 namgung et al 2014 therefore the oxidation of cr iii to cr vi in the oxic fes systems must be induced by other reactive species generated from the oxygenation of fes researchers have observed that oh fe iv h2o2 and fe iii may be generated in oxic fes systems and may render oxidative transformations of various contaminants bi et al 2016 cheng et al 2016 2020 jeong et al 2010 for instance transient fe iii species were considered responsible for the oxidation of u iv to u vi by do in the presence of fes bi et al 2016 and oh and fe iv during the oxygenation of fes were found likely accountable for the oxidation of as iii to as v jeong et al 2010 h2o2 and oh in pyrite activated h2o2 systems were able to convert sb iii into sb v kong hu and he 2015 in addition researchers have also noticed that ph can influence the forms of the reactive species and the transformation of cr iii to cr vi in such systems ye et al 2018 reported that h2o2 at ph 3 0 and oh at ph 9 0 in a zvi mediated fenton system were able to oxidize organically bound cr iii to cr vi xue et al 2016 2017 observed that h2o2 and oh radicals can oxidize cr iii to cr vi under alkaline conditions in an electro fenton system ye et al 2017 found that oh generated in a uv activated system oxidized organically bound cr iii to soluble cr vi at ph 2 0 6 0 to evaluate the involvement of h2o2 in the oxidation of cr iii the production of h2o2 from the oxygenation of fes was measured fig 5 a shows the concentration histories of h2o2 during the oxygenation of fes at ph 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 like other fenton processes the lower ph resulted in the greater concentration of h2o2 keenan and sedlak 2008 zhang et al 2020 the initial peak concentrations of h2o2 were 268 8 104 3 and 6 5 μm at ph values of 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 respectively namely the generation of h2o2 was negligible at ph 9 0 in contrast at the acidic and neutral ph h2o2 was detected right after the reaction was initiated but then fluctuated and eventually dropped to below the detection limit after 950 min the fluctuation of h2o2 reflects two contrasting reactions on the one hand h2o2 was generated via the reduction of o2 by the structural fe ii from the fes eq 1 on the other hand h2o2 was decomposed to generate oh eq 2 cheng et al 2016 in addition at acidic ph h2o2 can be produced through the redox reactions between o2 and fe ii from fes at ph 5 0 the initial surge 120 min in the h2o2 concentration was attributed to the direct reduction of o2 by fe ii from fes cheng et al 2016 whereas the second rise resulted from reduction of o2 by green rust formed from fes through solution phase oxidation following the dissolution of fes jeong et al 2010 at ph 9 0 the h2o2 concentration increased for 60 min and then decreased to below the detection limit and the much lower production of h2o2 was likely attributed to surface formation of fe ii and fe iii hydroxides which inhibited the fenton reactions at ph 7 0 the h2o2 concentration remained at a plateau with less bumpy fluctuation before it was completely consumed decomposed which was probably attributed to solution phase oxidation of dissolved fe ii following fes dissolution along with surface mediated oxidation of fes jeong et al 2010 tian et al 2020 at equilibrium the h2o2 decomposition reaction became predominant and no h2o2 was detected after 960 min the peak values of h2o2 during the oxygenation of fes were chosen as the initial concentrations of h2o2 used in the reaction of cr oh 3 s with h2o2 fig 5b shows that h2o2 alone was not effective in the oxidation of cr oh 3 s aqueous cr vi was not observed at ph 7 0 or 9 0 and 0 4 µm of cr vi was detected at ph 5 0 no evidence was observed that transient fe iii species were involved in the oxidation of cr iii sedlak and chan 1997 which is consistent with typical fenton processes to evaluate the contributions of oh and fe iv the cr iii oxidation experiments were carried out in the presence of 10 mm methanol 2 mm tert butanol or 1 mm ba methanol can quench many reactive oxidants including ros and fe iv whereas ba is an effective scavenger of oh and tert butanol can scavenge both fe iv and oh cheng et al 2016 qiu et al 2018 yamazaki and piette 1991 figs 5c and 5d show that the generation of aqueous cr vi was ceased in the presence of methanol indicating that ros or fe iv was responsible for the transformation of cr iii to cr vi meanwhile the presence of tert butanol remarkably decreased the production of aqueous cr vi indicating that fe iv and or oh might be the primary oxidant of cr iii furthermore the presence of ba completely quenched the reaction which indicates that oh was the primary ros accounting for the transformation of cr iii to cr vi 3 5 2 oh generation fig 6 shows the production of oh during the oxygenation of fes in the absence or presence of cr oh 3 s after an initial lag of oh production oh rapidly increased and gradually decreased in accord with typical fenton reactions the generation of oh was favored at acidic ph zhang et al 2020 with the final cumulative oh concentrations being 91 70 29 60 and 14 79 μm at ph 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 respectively fig 6a accordingly higher do concentrations were observed at higher ph fig s11a and more do was consumed at the acidic ph due to the formation of oh radicals during the oxygenation of fes in addition a lag for production of oh was observed because of the quenching of fes fig s12a which was consistent with the previous work cheng et al 2016 fig 6b shows the cumulative oh generation in the presence of cr iii at the three ph levels ba was used as a probe chemical to measure oh produced cheng et al 2016 joo et al 2005 qiu et al 2018 organic acids containing carboxyl groups are capable of dissolving cr iii from cr oh 3 s carbonaro et al 2008 control tests indicated that the presence of 1 mm ba showed no significant effect on the dissolution of cr oh 3 s fig s13 the cumulative oh increased and then reached a plateau with do increasing to a final concentration of 8 0 mg l 1 figs 6b and s11b compared to the control systems fig 6a the final cumulative oh concentrations were lowered by a factor of 2 8 and 3 6 times at ph 5 0 and 7 0 respectively however the cumulative concentration of oh was nearly the same as in the control system at ph 9 0 the apparently lower cumulative concentrations of oh under acidic and neutral conditions in the presence of cr oh 3 s can thus be ascribed to the stronger competition of cr iii and fes with ba in scavenging oh in an undersaturated system cr oh 3 s undergoes the following dissolution eq 11 11 cr oh 3 s 3 h cr iii aq 3 h2o k sp 6 3 10 31 the proton promoted dissolution is favored at acidic ph at ph 5 0 aqueous cr iii exists predominantly as croh2 rai eary and zachara 1989 which can be adsorbed onto the negatively charged surface of the fes nps phpzc 4 09 fig s3f this was partially confirmed by the rapid disappearance of the aqueous cr iii from its initial value of 8 99 μm upon the addition of fes nps fig 1c at ph 7 0 the cr oh 3 s particles phpzc 7 16 were positively charged while the fes nps phpzc 4 09 were negatively charged and they co precipitated due to the electrostatic attraction figs s1b and s3f the adsorption of croh2 or cr oh 3 s on the fes nps would not only shield cr iii from being oxidized due to the fes induced reducing environment figs 5c and 5d but also quench the fes mediated generation of oh at ph 9 0 cr oh 3 s and fes nps are both negatively charged and thus the presence of the former will not retard the fes enabled fenton process in addition fe hydr oxides from the oxidation of fes may accumulate on the fes nps which can also passivate the surface reactivities of fes a close examination of the initial generation of oh in the presence of cr iii during the oxygenation of fes revealed a notable lag time of 5 10 min fig s12b accordingly the appearance of aqueous cr vi also showed an initial lag phase fig 1a the initial adsorption of cr iii at ph 5 0 and 7 0 is both thermodynamically and kinetically favorable the adsorbed cr iii not only hinders the fes facilitated generation of oh but also renders more oh consumed by the competing electron donors fe ii and s ii from the fes at ph 9 0 more oh was used for the oxidation of cr iii and thus the lag in the formation of oh could be due to the competitive scavenging of oh by fe ii and s ii on the surface of fes cheng et al 2016 following the initial lag phase both aqueous cr vi and cr vi on the solid surface sharply increased figs 1 4 which is ascribed to rapid generation of oh from the oxygenation of fes figs 6b and s12b the concentrations of oh in the presence of cr oh 3 s at ph 5 0 and 7 0 were 15 65 μm at 60 min and 5 12 μm at 30 min corresponding to 48 6 and 62 5 of the final commutative yields respectively at ph 9 0 when the aqueous cr vi reached its peak at 60 min the oh concentration reached 8 84 μm 61 4 of the final total yield figs 6b and s12b in the initial stage the production rate of oh outweighed the radical scavenging rate and accordingly the oxidation rate of cr iii outcompeted the reduction rate of cr vi resulting in the accumulation of cr vi as the reaction proceeded to equilibrium the yield of oh gradually plateaued fig 6b and the reduction rate of cr vi outcompeted the production rate leading to the decrease in cr vi figs 1 4 eventually cr vi was reduced to cr iii in the presence of sufficient fe ii and or s ii eqs 7 10 mamun et al 2018 wang et al 2019 2020 and the final amount of residual cr vi in the systems depends on the fes to cr iii molar ratio fig 4 and table s1 in addition compared with those in the absence of cr iii changes of aqueous fe ii concentrations in the presence of cr iii also confirmed that cr iii can be oxidized by oh to cr vi initially followed with the reduction of the newly generated cr vi during the oxygenation of fes fig s14 3 5 3 mechanism of fes mediated oxidation of cr iii taken together the experimental findings the fes mediated oxidation of cr iii was controlled by the kinetics of complex redox reactions occurring concurrently in the oxic fes nps systems fig 7 shows the proposed reaction mechanism first oh was generated through the fenton like reactions through activation of o2 by fe ii from the fes eqs 1 and 2 cheng et al 2016 the initial rapid generation of oh resulted in rapid oxidation of cr iii into cr vi per the following reaction eq 12 xue et al 2016 12 cr iii 3 oh 3 oh cr vi conversely the oxidation is counteracted by the competitive scavenging of oh by fe ii and s ii from fes and by the reduction reaction by these electron donors eqs 7 10 in addition depending on the system ph the redox reactions may be affected by some other adsorption and surface passivation processes at acidic or neutral ph aqueous cr iii and cr oh 3 s are subject to adsorption on a negatively charged fes surface it is unfavorable for adsorbed cr iii species to be oxidized due to the local strong reducing environment on the fes surface at alkaline ph the adsorption of cr oh 3 s becomes unfavorable due to the electrostatic repulsion between the like charged surfaces figs s1b and s3f in addition aqueous cr iii becomes negligible due to the decreased solubility of cr iii rai eary and zachara 1989 moreover the surface precipitation of fe hydr oxides on fes may retard the reactivity of the fes in the early stage the rates of the fenton like reactions and the associated oxidation of cr iii by oh were faster than the reduction rate of the resulting cr vi namely fe ii were preferentially used in the fenton like reactions as a result the higher fes to cr iii molar ratio the higher the yield of oh and the more generation of cr vi figs 1 6 the acidic ph favored the generation of oh due to more favorable conditions for the fenton reactions after the initial peaking the generation of oh and cr vi dropped because of the elevated scavenging effect as more fe ii and s ii became available in the system meanwhile the reduction rate of cr vi exceeded the generation rate eqs 8 10 wang et al 2019 patterson et al 1997 wang et al 2020 at a higher fes to cr iii molar ratio e g 10 1 the resulting cr vi was completely reduced to cr iii which remained stable thereafter conversely at a lower fes to cr iii molar ratio e g 1 1 a fraction of the cr vi was adsorbed on the oxidation products of fes and remained in the system fig 4 and table s1 4 conclusions this work investigated the redox speciation of solid cr iii species in the presence of fes nps under oxic conditions rapid initial transformation of cr iii to cr vi was found upon oxygenation of fes which was jointly controlled by the oxidation of cr iii to cr vi and the reduction of the newly generated cr vi during the initial oxygenation of fes oh was rapidly generated through the fes mediated fenton like reactions and acted as the predominant reactive species for the oxidation of cr iii to cr vi resulting in rapid accumulation of cr vi as the process proceeded the oxidation of cr iii was counteracted by the competitive scavenging of oh by fe ii and s ii from fes and by the reduction reaction by these electron donors in the presence of sufficient fes in the system cr vi was eventually reduced back to cr iii by fe ii and or s ii and the resulting cr iii may remain stable over prolonged period of time due to the protective role of fes acidic conditions and higher molar ratio of fes to cr iii might favor the initial generation of cr vi at equilibrium a small fraction of cr vi persisted on the surface of the solid oxidation products of fes at lower fes cr iii molar ratios e g 1 1 while all cr vi was reduced back to cr iii at elevated fes cr iii molar ratios e g 10 1 the findings provide some new insights into the redox transformation of cr in natural and engineered aquatic systems containing fes and cr iii when exposed to atmospheric conditions and may aid in controlling the toxic effects of cr in the environment credit authorship contribution statement tao wang investigation writing

16322,dissolved organic matter dom is a complicated assembly of organic molecules including thousands of molecules with various structures and properties however how the stream dom sources respond to carbon compositions and the transformation processes remains unclear in this study the chemical characteristics and spectral and mass spectrometry ft icr ms of dom were analyzed six sampling points of headwater stream hwss were sampled and an effluent polluted stream wsr and a main stream of the changjiang river dt were also sampled for comparison in situ degradation experiments and ft icr ms analysis were also performed to observe the dynamic processes of dom in hws the results showed that the anthropogenic markers of sewage i e sulfur s compounds and marker from antibiotics and estrogen in hws were higher than those in dt the molecular weight decreased while the degradation products s containing compounds and unsaturated compounds hu increased after in situ degradation due to the influence of both the photodegradation and biodegradation process in addition the kmd plots showed that the dom homologue intensities in range 400 600 da changed significantly after demethylation by biodegradation the components of highly refractory substances and the degradation degree of dom in dt was higher than that in hws we extracted the refractory dom pool in hws which was mainly small molecular with molecular weights 600 da these molecular will be difficult to remove in traditional drinking water treatment processes and easily produced disinfection byproducts dbps this study emphasized the necessity of identifying the sources and transformation processes of dom in hws and clarified the types and characteristics of dom that should be considered in future drinking water treatment graphical abstracts image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter ft icr ms molecular composition headwater stream disinfection byproducts 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom is a complex combination of organic molecules including thousands of molecules with various structures and properties dom is a key component of stream and river ecosystems and plays many significant roles koch and dittmar 2016 raymond and spencer 2014 for example dom can be a carbon and energy supply to aquatic organisms and affect the carbon cycle chen et al 2019a york and bell 2020 promote the transportation of other pollutants such as heavy metals yan et al 2017 affect water quality and affect the efficiency of drinking water treatment efforts d andrilli et al 2019 vaughn et al 2021 taken together dom is crucial in terms of both the carbon cycle and water quality berg et al 2019 the presence of dom can be problematic in the production of drinking water and infection is one of the main treatment processes in all water treatment plants shi et al 2021 the reaction between dom and disinfectants form disinfection byproducts dbps gan et al 2020 hua et al 2019 because small dom molecules are difficult to be removed in the drinking water treatment process these are important precursors of dbps prasert et al 2021 zhang et al 2012 therefore identifying the precursors of dbps in dom is of great significance to improve the drinking water quality the processes of dom transportation through river networks to estuaries and coastal waters will be combined with reactions and degradation resulting in changes in its compositions and structures casas ruiz et al 2017 lv et al 2019 the reactions and degradation of dom in river networks were significantly affected by dom sources bowen et al 2019 stahl et al 2021 previous studies conducted dom degradation experiments and observed significant degradation processes and products in different dom components jaffe et al 2012 lv et al 2019 mostovaya et al 2016 the identification of dom sources in river networks helps to improve the accuracy of carbon conversion mechanisms and water quality estimations dom sources in rivers include autochthonous and allochthonous sources autochthonous dom comes from organisms such as emergent floating and submerged vegetation and periphyton carstea et al 2016 while allochthonous dom originates from terrigenous and anthropogenic dom terrestrial dom is mainly consistent with lignin and tannin compounds that contain carbon c hydrogen h and oxygen o molecules while anthropogenic dom is primarily consistent with more protein aliphatic compounds and compounds containing nitrogen n and sulfur s molecules chen and yu 2021 ye et al 2019 autochthonous dom is a complex composed of c h and o atoms in its molecular formula there are depleted o atoms enriched h atoms a lower aromaticity index aiw and higher degradable protein and aliphatic contents than terrestrial dom kellerman et al 2015 ware et al 2022 technically a series of techniques was derived to help further understand the composition and properties of dom including spectral uv visible absorbance spectroscopy uv vis and excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec and mass spectrometry fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms analysis hayball et al 2018 sgroi et al 2017 for example the absorbance at 254 nm in the uv vis range uv254 represents the content of aromatic compounds yan et al 2017 eem can identify different fluorescent components according to parallel factor parafac analysis carstea et al 2016 hu et al 2017 lin and guo 2020 yet the nonfluorescent components of dom cannot be identified hpsec can determine the relative molecular weight mw component of dom mcadams et al 2018 however these techniques can only give relatively abstract conclusions and cannot provide important information such as the source and specific components of organic matter ft icr ms overcomes these limitations and provides a high resolution view of molecular dom composition chen et al 2020b o driscoll et al 2018 because of its high resolution ft icr ms can obtain thousands of highly accurate dom molecular formulas and relative contents of 1000 da in one analysis which may provide useful information to understand dom features ware et al 2022 specific molecular parameters i e elemental ratio h c o c and aiw can distinguish dom into different compounds including saturation oxidation and aromaticity dittmar et al 2021 the combination of spectroscopy and ft icr ms is critical for extending our understanding of the dynamic transformation of dom in natural environments as key areas across landscapes headwater streams hwss are affected more by terrestrial and anthropogenic dom due to their proximity to terrestrial sources high drainage density large total areas and stream lengths benstead and leigh 2012 messager et al 2021 in china the hws in many catchments is used as a source of drinking water the hws is generally located in rural areas affected by anthropogenic pollution especially organic pollution considering these geophysical and hydrological facts the hws can transport large amounts of dom from multiple sources abbott et al 2018 however there are few studies on the sources composition and reactivity of dom that directly affect the migration and transformation of dom in drinking water sources and further affect the carbon cycle especially at the molecular level it was hypothesized that 1 the increasing composition and chemodiversity of dom across streams and rivers are driven by human activities 2 rural domestic sewage and agricultural runoff jointly control the sources and compositions of dom in the hws and 3 stream ecosystem respiration er affects the diurnal dynamics of dom transformation and transport in the hws in this study the compositions of dom diurnal changes in uv vis eem and ft icr ms characteristics and er were measured in five hwss in two headwater catchments in southeastern china in 2020 emphasizing the need to include an assessment of dom sources and transformation and transport in the hws the objectives of this study were to 1 identify the dom molecular composition and sources across the hws and a large river by multiple organic analysis techniques 2 explore changes in the molecular composition of dom during diurnal scale degradation er and photodegradation in the hws and 3 provide information about refractory components of dom transported into drinking water sources 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area site description sample collection and analysis this study was primarily conducted in two headwater catchments in southeastern china with one catchment in the yankou reservoir catchment yrc and another in tianmu lake catchment tlc and a large river watershed changjiang river basin fig 1 yrc 119 90 119 92 e 29 29

four headwater streams among which the two larger streams are huangshanxi hsx stream and sihe sh stream and the other two smaller are jinfuzhai jfz stream and xihuaxi xhx stream the tlc consists of three headwater streams named zhongtian stream zt xiasong stream xs and pingqiao stream pq zt is the largest stream and xs and pq are the two smaller streams all these seven streams are drinking water streams field in situ observations and sampling were performed from september through october 2020 in the yrc and tlc a total of 6 sites were chosen in five streams for spatial study and in situ daily degradation study in two headwater catchments one site each in hsx sh and jfz in the yrc one site in the upstream and one in the downstream of zt and one in xs in the tlc fig 1 all these six samples were defined as the hwss two additional sample sites were selected to study spatial variations in dom composition with one site located in the river month datong hydrological station dt of the changjiang river and another stream polluted by rural wastewater wsr located in a small stream receiving the urban wastewater effluent from yiwu city we designed two time points 16 00 and 04 00 the next day to sample and identified the daily changes of doc doc mg l 1 uv vis eem and ft icr ms the doc uv vis and eem were sampled in september and october and the ft icr ms was measured in october water samples were collected at 0 5 m below the water surface stored in clean 1000 ml polyethylene bottles taken to the laboratory within 24 h and refrigerated in dark conditions the samples were immediately filtered through pre combusted 0 7 μm glass fiber filter whatman gf f and filtered through precleaned 0 22 μm polycarbonate membrane filters millipore subsequently the filtrates were then stored at 4 c in the dark before further analysis we also estimated the er in the hwss based on the changes of dissolved oxygen do do mg l 1 and water temperature t using a multi parameter meter ysi 550a usa and the δ13cdic values were also sampled and measured at 14 00 and 04 00 the next day to observe daily changes gong et al 2021 2 2 spectroscopic analysis and parafac modeling uv vis and eem were obtained by a diode array spectrophotometer agilent 8453 and a fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi f7000 japan fig s1 parallel factor parafac analysis was used to analyze the optical data

the linear relationships between optical and molecular parameters of dom and the correlations between principal components and optical and molecular parameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 optical characteristics of dom and its spatial variation the average value of doc was 2 45 0 47 mg l 1 and uv254 was 0 06 0 01 cm 1 which were similar to those of dt 2 55 mg l 1 and 0 05 cm 1 and wsr 2 89 mg l 1 and 0 05 cm 1 table s1 but the suva values were 2 05 0 28 l mg c 1 m 1 in hwss 1 96 l mg c 1 m 1 in dt and 0 87 l mg c 1 m 1 in wsr indicating that the contents of cdom were similar in dt hwss and wsr but the aromaticity of cdom was significantly higher in hwss and dt than that in wsr the hix values of each sampling point were approximated with an average of 0 72 0 02 which were lower than those in soil 0 8 indicating that similar humification of dom and that higher effects of leached from the soil were observed in all sampling sites chen et al 2020a the fluorescence index fi can indicate the dom source 1 9 microbial source 1 4 terrestrial origin derrien et al 2019 fi values ranged from 1 49 to 2 01 in sampling sites indicating much dom derived from extracellular release and leachate from bacteria and microbial source than terrestrial source the bix 1 represents autochthonous input whereas the lower bix represents less contribution of freshly derived dom xu and guo 2017 we found bix values in hws were lower than 1 but significantly higher than that in dt indicating higher freshly derived dom in hws than that in dt the a355 values were calculated as a descriptor for the quantity of chromophoric dom cdom hansell and carlson 2015 these a355 values in hws were considerably higher than those in other natural water bodies and similar to that in wsr indicating that the hws was affected by sewage in addition the sr values which is a proxy for dom molecular weight in hws 0 87 0 16 were higher than that in wsr 0 76 and lower than that in dt 1 28 fig s3 table s1 revealing the relatively larger percentage of high molecular weight dom in hwss than dt liu et al 2020 we found no monthly differences in stream spectral parameters p 0 05 the spectral parameters described the impact of different sources on dom composition indicated the contribution of autochthonous and terrestrial dom in hws to be higher than that in dt and also reflected the anthropogenic effluent affect in hws four fluorescent components were identified by parafac openfluor including two protein like components c2 and c3 and two humic like c1 and c4 components fig s2 table s2 murphy et al 2014 specifically humic like component c1 ex em 280 235 395 nm was associated with low molecular weight microdegraded organisms which widely exist in wastewater and agricultural environments cory and mcknight 2005 murphy et al 2006 another humic like component c4 ex em 365 250 490 nm was similar to fulvic acid and widely exists in natural water table s2 murphy et al 2018 protein like component c2 ex em 275 230 340 nm was classified as tryptophan wang et al 2019 and c3 ex em 265 315 nm was classified as tyrosine consisting of amino acid free or amino acid bound proteins baker 2002 he et al 2020 we found no monthly differences for four parafaccomponents p 0 05 the contents of protein like components c2 and c3 were significantly higher than humic like components c1 and c4 the average relative proportions of c3 components in hws and wsr were lower than that of dt and the c2 component was the opposite two humic like components c1 and c4 had no spatial variations in all sampling sites table s1 and the four components had no spatial variations in yrc and tlc p 0 05 fig s4 human and animal excreta are rich in protein substances mainly composed of tryptophan and tyrosine wolfbeis 1985 these fluorescent components demonstrate that the anthropogenic effect in hws might be the reason of higher percentage of protein like dom 3 2 linking dom ft icr ms molecular signatures to the source material we used ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry to unambiguously identify 5595 to 8789 average 7668 733 molecular formulas in all sampling sites table 1 it was found that the molecular chemodiversity in hws dt and wsr did not change significantly the results were significantly higher than those of other studies in rivers wagner et al 2015 lakes kellerman et al 2014 ni et al 2021 reservoirs he et al 2020 and streams mosher et al 2015 from 3053 to 6818 average 4647 1088 the significantly increased dom molecular diversity may be affected by factors such as river size grade and human activities in this study it was found that the chemodiversity of the changjiang river mainstream and hws was similar indicating that the higher chemodiversity had no significant correlation with the river order and river size fig s5 and table 1 the possible reason for the high chemodiversity was the input of a large amount of anthropogenic dom casas ruiz et al 2020 mosher et al 2015 however it was found that the number of identified molecules had a significant positive correlation with the s atom intensity n 16 p 0 05 fig s6 therefore the high chemical diversity of dom in the hws was caused by anthropogenic sewage input principal component analysis pca was used to analyze the spatial variation of different dom compounds and various indicators fig s7 we observed that the doc uv254 and the indicators and components obtained from eem and ft icr ms had no spatial change in yrc and tlc fig s8 and s9 the first principal component dim1 explained 62 5 of the variance and was significantly correlated with h c n 14 r 0 601 p 0 05 chos compound abundance n 14 r 0 678 p 0 05 s atom intensity n 14 r 0 679 p 0 05 c2 n 14 r 0 36 p 0 05 and c3 component n 14 r 0 38 p 0 05 h c ratio s atom intensity and chos compound abundance were indicators of domestic wastewater lian et al 2020 so dim1 was controlled by the input of domestic wastewater fig s7 the relative abundance of chos was higher than other large rivers in the world the abundance in hws 13 16 3 63 was significantly higher than that in dt 7 26 and lower than that in wsr 38 83 fig 2 and the similarity of cho and chos in the lignin region of the hws dt and wsr was low fig s10 which indicated that most s containing compounds come from other sources i e anthropogenic effluence except the natural source gonsior et al 2011 qiu et al 2020 the abundances of the o3s and o5s classes of compounds in hwss were significantly higher than those of other classes of s containing compounds and other s containing compounds except o3s and o5s were distributed in gaussian distribution fig 3 the abundances of the o3s and o5s classes of compounds were significantly negatively correlated with o intensity n 14 p 0 01 and significantly positively correlated with the c2 component n 14 p 0 05 indicating that a large number of linear alkylbenzene sulfonates las existed in domestic sewage contaminated water was inputted into the hws melendez perez et al 2018 las is likely associated with the content of o3s component and is an anionic surfactant which is most widely used surfactants in detergents in china derrien et al 2019 mungray and kumar 2009 and the o5s compounds could be generated by the degradation of las under aerobic conditions salmani et al 2021 the abundance on o3s and o5s classes of compounds accounted for 0 38 of the total chos intensitiy in hws 0 30 in dt and 0 45 in wsr table 2 suggesting an increasing level of anthropogenic input in dt hwss and wsr in agreement with the same increasing fluorescence intensity of c2 component table s1 in addition the markers table s3 of sewage including lipid drugs and antibiotics were also selected to study the impact of rural sewage in hws fig s11 although ft icr ms cannot accurately identify molecular structure it can accurately identify molecular weight the identification of markers was based on the molecular formula and it is considered that molecules with the same molecular formula were possible molecules we observed the same formulas with nalidixic acid gemfibrozil ketoprofen estrone estradiol and estriol in hws fig s11 and table s3 molecular of the target pollutants and corresponding information were collected from the chinese medical statistical yearbook 2008 two common dom industrial production intermediates were selected sunset yellow from food coloring yang et al 2017 and 4 hydroxybenzenesulfonate from the pharmaceutical industry wang et al 2020 sunset yellow and 4 hydroxybenzenesulfonate were not found in hws but were found in wsr therefore the hws was only affected by domestic sewage and was almost unaffected by industrial pollution the c2 component relative abundance of the o3s and o5s and markers i e antibiotics drugs and hormones can be used to evaluate the effect of domestic sewage pca showed that dim2 explained 17 3 of the variance and was positively correlated with crams n 14 r 0 62 p 0 05 and hu n 14 r 0 56 p 0 05 fig s7 the relative abundances of crams and hu are mainly produced by recalcitrant molecules that were from soils or higher plants and lignin metabolism and therefore indicate terrestrial dom sources lechtenfeld et al 2014 wagner et al 2015 therefore the relationship between these two molecular parameters along dim2 may reflect the relative contribution of recalcitrant molecules from terrigenous features or higher plants bahureksa et al 2021 ware et al 2022 the content of cho was highest in different compounds and the average value in hws 68 63 3 56 was similar to that in dt 72 85 which was higher than that of wsr 48 12 table 1 the cho compounds showed gaussian distribution indicating a similar origin and precursor structure of cho compounds in all sampling sites fig 3 melendez perez et al 2016 due to a large number of carboxyl carbonyl and or hydroxyl functional groups aromatic dom has high solubility in water and most of them are distributed in the water column liu et al 2021 seidel et al 2015 the higher the aiw value is the more aromatic components there are in dom and the greater input of terrestrial or large vascular plants jaffe et al 2013 medeiros et al 2016 the aiw value of the algae dominated aquatic environment was less than 0 11 lee et al 2019b the relative abundances of pa polyphenols and aiw values which indicated the input of terrestrial or large vascular plants in hws were higher than that in dt wsr and other studies i e the three gorges pang et al 2021 the pearl river liu et al 2020 and other large rivers in the world wagner et al 2015 bix in hws decreased and suva and hix increased due to the large input of aromatic and humic dom table s1 lee et al 2019b yoon and raymond 2012 therefore relatively more allochthonous dom was introduced into the hws due to their proximity to terrestrial sources molecular formulas depleted in o and enriched in h with lower aiw may be derived from autochthonous sources koch and dittmar 2006 ware et al 2022 and are generally categorized as unsaturated aliphatics and peptides which were usually considered as fresh and labile molecules he et al 2019 although these compounds have also been identified in soil solutions derived from secondary plant metabolites and or soil microbes jimenez morillo et al 2018 we observed relatively higher abundances of unsaturated aliphatic and peptides in hws than that in dt fig s12 table 2 the aiw values in hws were also higher than that in dt table 1 which might influence by the input of terrestrial or large vascular plants lee et al 2019a indicating that slower water velocity and sufficient organic n in hws gong et al 2021 xu and guo 2017 were beneficial to autochthonous dom 3 3 transformations of chemical properties and biogeochemical reactivity in the hws although the same molecular composition may be different due to different functional groups to simplify the analysis it was assumed that the same molecular formula was the same substance the molecular formula extracted by ft icr ms contains the degraded components and intermediates generated during the degradation process figs 4 and 5 additionally it was assumed that there was no input of other pollutants within a day and that changes in dom were controlled only by river processes it should be recognized that ft icr ms identification was selective and the unknown number of molecules falls outside the analysis window not every mineralization and degradation product can be identified so the identified degradation products may not be the sum of unstable degradation compounds identified in the original sample leyva et al 2019 however the molecular formula determined by ft icr ms was important for the preliminary estimation of the dom degradation process the photodegradation and respiration of dom will occur within hours so a large proportion of degradable dom will be degraded at a daily scale bernhardt et al 2018 lv et al 2019 microbial degradation and photodegradation can directly mineralize highly unsaturated dom into co2 sawakuchi et al 2020 seidel et al 2015 or indirectly mineralize it into low molecular weight dom cory and kling 2018 hansen et al 2016 the average doc was 2 51 0 48 mg c l 1 in the daytime and 2 39 0 45 mg c l 1 in the nighttime there were obvious daily changes in suva sr and c2 component n 12 p 0 05 while other indicators and components showed no daily variations p 0 05 the decrease of suva and sr indicated the decrease of dom aromaticity after degradation the sr mlbl dbe abundances of hu and s containing compounds increased n 6 p 0 05 while the suva mw abundances of aliphatic peptide and aromatic groups decreased after degradation n 6 p 0 05 fig s13 table s1 these indicators obtained from ft icr ms had similar changes with those from uv vis and eem and can also be proven through the uv vis and eem the changes of pa and hu components extracted from the degradable dom components which were mainly tannins or lignin and their degradation products were mainly changed through photodegradation d andrilli et al 2015 textor et al 2019 the significantly daily changes of c2 component indicate the process of biodegradation n 12 p 0 05 ua and peptides are generally biologically unstable and their contents are also decreased compared with those before degradation significant positive correlations between er and aliphatic and peptide compounds were found n 6 p 0 05 indicating that aliphatic and peptide compounds promoted river microbial respiration antony et al 2017 zark and dittmar 2018 we also compared the kmd of unique dom in hws before and after daily degradation and found that the intensity of kmd peaks shifted to lower mw significantly fig s14 because the number of oxygen atoms as well as rings and double bonds increase monotonically with kmd wang et al 2021 homologs shifting towards lower mw could be explained by substitution of alkyl chain which represented the difference in dom aliphaticity jimenez morillo et al 2018 it also showed that dom in hws has undergone obvious microbial degradation processes which generally occurs in the mw range of 400 600 da fig s14 higher sewage input increased the content of heteroatoms s geng et al 2018 and significantly affected the transformation and degradation of dom in streams bittar et al 2015 for example the las input from domestic sewage will lead to the increase of the intensity of s atom lian et al 2020 lignin cho compounds can form chos compounds with s atoms through abiotic pathways melendez perez et al 2016 therefore the degradability of dom and drinking water quality in streams will further be affected above all photodegradation microbial degradation and the input of human domestic sewage jointly affect the processes of dom transformation in the river network after degradation dom was transformed into smaller and more refractory molecules which would have a significant impact on the treatment of drinking water fig 6 kellerman et al 2018 lechtenfeld et al 2014 3 4 identifying the refractory molecules in hws and the implications for drinking water treatment from upstream to downstream of the river the degradability of dom decreased gradually therefore the dom at the outlet of the river system can represent the collection of refractory dom in the whole basin li et al 2021 osburn et al 2016 in this study the regional heterogeneity of dom and the supplementation of degradable dom were ignored and it was contended that the dom of the dt station could represent the refractory dom pool in the river network qiu et al 2020 the refractory dom pool contained a total of 1085 molecular formulas in hws with an average h c value of 1 07 and an o c value of 0 37 fig 6a the mw value of the refractory dom pool was 151 635 da which was similar to the 250 550 da found in previous studies of the three gorges reservoir pang et al 2021 the markers i e nalidixic acid ketoprofen and estriol identified for the input of domestic sewage were found in the refractory dom pool table s3 it indicates that antibiotics or estrogenic imported through resident sewage are difficult to be degraded in the natural environment and the general molecular weight is 300 da however chow et al 2008 studied the removal efficiency of a series of molecular weight dom and found that dom of 300 500 da was extremely difficult to remove wang et al 2021 therefore part of the dom inputted from anthropogenic discharge was difficult to be degraded and had a small molecular weight that was difficult to be removed through traditional drinking water treatment processes which will have a significant impact on drinking water quality the o c and h c ranges of dbps obtained by ft icr ms were 0 3 0 7 and 0 7 1 4 respectively and the molecular weight ranges were 300 500 da andersson et al 2019 meanwhile ft icr ms showed that there was a high intensity of dbps precursors in the refractory pool of hws fig 6b and the dbps precursors primarily originated from terrestrial dom with high aromaticity and low mw fig 6 thus the removal of these precursors is critical for reducing the formation of dbps and the water quality of the drinking water overall preventing the formation of dbps in drinking water treatment processes and preventing the anthropogenic discharge input will play significant roles in drinking water safety korshin and yan 2018 4 conclusions in this study various optical and fluorescence components and parameters were detected by ft icr ms and 3d eem spectroscopy four eem components including two humic like and two protein like compounds were obtained by parallel factor analysis hu and polyphenols are two main chemical constituents of dom accounting for 80 5 91 2 ua and peptides accounted for a relatively small proportion but they were the main chemical components reflecting dom differences in different aquatic ecosystems relatively more terrestrial dom with higher aromaticity and humification degree more autochthonous dom and more anthropogenic dom in hws than those in large river dt were revealed by ft icr ms and biomarkers analysis from domestic sewage and industrial wastewater these significant variations in dom chemistry has mainly resulted from the input of domestic sewage its greater proximity to terrestrial and special hydrological characteristics i e shallow stream depth and slow flow rate in situ daily dom degradation experiments showed that mw suva and hix decreased and dbe s containing compounds hu ua and peptides increased while proteins and lipids decreased after degradation and the kmd plots before and after daily degradation provided that the homologous series were degraded through biodegradation these variations indicate that significant photodegradation and biodegradation processes happened in hws and the biodegradation mainly occurred in the mw range of 400 600 da the mw value of the refractory dom pool was 151 635 da which is considered difficult to remove during drinking water treatment the same molecular formula as the commonly used antibiotics and estrogen markers we selected exists in the refractory dom pool and the molecular weight is 300 da which is difficult to be removed and has a significant impact on water quality in addition a large number of refractory dom are mainly composed of lignin compounds which are important precursors of dbps in the drinking water disinfection process therefore preventing the formation of dbps in drinking water treatment processes and preventing the anthropogenic discharge input will play significantly roles in drinking water safety declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

16322,dissolved organic matter dom is a complicated assembly of organic molecules including thousands of molecules with various structures and properties however how the stream dom sources respond to carbon compositions and the transformation processes remains unclear in this study the chemical characteristics and spectral and mass spectrometry ft icr ms of dom were analyzed six sampling points of headwater stream hwss were sampled and an effluent polluted stream wsr and a main stream of the changjiang river dt were also sampled for comparison in situ degradation experiments and ft icr ms analysis were also performed to observe the dynamic processes of dom in hws the results showed that the anthropogenic markers of sewage i e sulfur s compounds and marker from antibiotics and estrogen in hws were higher than those in dt the molecular weight decreased while the degradation products s containing compounds and unsaturated compounds hu increased after in situ degradation due to the influence of both the photodegradation and biodegradation process in addition the kmd plots showed that the dom homologue intensities in range 400 600 da changed significantly after demethylation by biodegradation the components of highly refractory substances and the degradation degree of dom in dt was higher than that in hws we extracted the refractory dom pool in hws which was mainly small molecular with molecular weights 600 da these molecular will be difficult to remove in traditional drinking water treatment processes and easily produced disinfection byproducts dbps this study emphasized the necessity of identifying the sources and transformation processes of dom in hws and clarified the types and characteristics of dom that should be considered in future drinking water treatment graphical abstracts image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter ft icr ms molecular composition headwater stream disinfection byproducts 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom is a complex combination of organic molecules including thousands of molecules with various structures and properties dom is a key component of stream and river ecosystems and plays many significant roles koch and dittmar 2016 raymond and spencer 2014 for example dom can be a carbon and energy supply to aquatic organisms and affect the carbon cycle chen et al 2019a york and bell 2020 promote the transportation of other pollutants such as heavy metals yan et al 2017 affect water quality and affect the efficiency of drinking water treatment efforts d andrilli et al 2019 vaughn et al 2021 taken together dom is crucial in terms of both the carbon cycle and water quality berg et al 2019 the presence of dom can be problematic in the production of drinking water and infection is one of the main treatment processes in all water treatment plants shi et al 2021 the reaction between dom and disinfectants form disinfection byproducts dbps gan et al 2020 hua et al 2019 because small dom molecules are difficult to be removed in the drinking water treatment process these are important precursors of dbps prasert et al 2021 zhang et al 2012 therefore identifying the precursors of dbps in dom is of great significance to improve the drinking water quality the processes of dom transportation through river networks to estuaries and coastal waters will be combined with reactions and degradation resulting in changes in its compositions and structures casas ruiz et al 2017 lv et al 2019 the reactions and degradation of dom in river networks were significantly affected by dom sources bowen et al 2019 stahl et al 2021 previous studies conducted dom degradation experiments and observed significant degradation processes and products in different dom components jaffe et al 2012 lv et al 2019 mostovaya et al 2016 the identification of dom sources in river networks helps to improve the accuracy of carbon conversion mechanisms and water quality estimations dom sources in rivers include autochthonous and allochthonous sources autochthonous dom comes from organisms such as emergent floating and submerged vegetation and periphyton carstea et al 2016 while allochthonous dom originates from terrigenous and anthropogenic dom terrestrial dom is mainly consistent with lignin and tannin compounds that contain carbon c hydrogen h and oxygen o molecules while anthropogenic dom is primarily consistent with more protein aliphatic compounds and compounds containing nitrogen n and sulfur s molecules chen and yu 2021 ye et al 2019 autochthonous dom is a complex composed of c h and o atoms in its molecular formula there are depleted o atoms enriched h atoms a lower aromaticity index aiw and higher degradable protein and aliphatic contents than terrestrial dom kellerman et al 2015 ware et al 2022 technically a series of techniques was derived to help further understand the composition and properties of dom including spectral uv visible absorbance spectroscopy uv vis and excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec and mass spectrometry fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms analysis hayball et al 2018 sgroi et al 2017 for example the absorbance at 254 nm in the uv vis range uv254 represents the content of aromatic compounds yan et al 2017 eem can identify different fluorescent components according to parallel factor parafac analysis carstea et al 2016 hu et al 2017 lin and guo 2020 yet the nonfluorescent components of dom cannot be identified hpsec can determine the relative molecular weight mw component of dom mcadams et al 2018 however these techniques can only give relatively abstract conclusions and cannot provide important information such as the source and specific components of organic matter ft icr ms overcomes these limitations and provides a high resolution view of molecular dom composition chen et al 2020b o driscoll et al 2018 because of its high resolution ft icr ms can obtain thousands of highly accurate dom molecular formulas and relative contents of 1000 da in one analysis which may provide useful information to understand dom features ware et al 2022 specific molecular parameters i e elemental ratio h c o c and aiw can distinguish dom into different compounds including saturation oxidation and aromaticity dittmar et al 2021 the combination of spectroscopy and ft icr ms is critical for extending our understanding of the dynamic transformation of dom in natural environments as key areas across landscapes headwater streams hwss are affected more by terrestrial and anthropogenic dom due to their proximity to terrestrial sources high drainage density large total areas and stream lengths benstead and leigh 2012 messager et al 2021 in china the hws in many catchments is used as a source of drinking water the hws is generally located in rural areas affected by anthropogenic pollution especially organic pollution considering these geophysical and hydrological facts the hws can transport large amounts of dom from multiple sources abbott et al 2018 however there are few studies on the sources composition and reactivity of dom that directly affect the migration and transformation of dom in drinking water sources and further affect the carbon cycle especially at the molecular level it was hypothesized that 1 the increasing composition and chemodiversity of dom across streams and rivers are driven by human activities 2 rural domestic sewage and agricultural runoff jointly control the sources and compositions of dom in the hws and 3 stream ecosystem respiration er affects the diurnal dynamics of dom transformation and transport in the hws in this study the compositions of dom diurnal changes in uv vis eem and ft icr ms characteristics and er were measured in five hwss in two headwater catchments in southeastern china in 2020 emphasizing the need to include an assessment of dom sources and transformation and transport in the hws the objectives of this study were to 1 identify the dom molecular composition and sources across the hws and a large river by multiple organic analysis techniques 2 explore changes in the molecular composition of dom during diurnal scale degradation er and photodegradation in the hws and 3 provide information about refractory components of dom transported into drinking water sources 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area site description sample collection and analysis this study was primarily conducted in two headwater catchments in southeastern china with one catchment in the yankou reservoir catchment yrc and another in tianmu lake catchment tlc and a large river watershed changjiang river basin fig 1 yrc 119 90 119 92 e 29 29

four headwater streams among which the two larger streams are huangshanxi hsx stream and sihe sh stream and the other two smaller are jinfuzhai jfz stream and xihuaxi xhx stream the tlc consists of three headwater streams named zhongtian stream zt xiasong stream xs and pingqiao stream pq zt is the largest stream and xs and pq are the two smaller streams all these seven streams are drinking water streams field in situ observations and sampling were performed from september through october 2020 in the yrc and tlc a total of 6 sites were chosen in five streams for spatial study and in situ daily degradation study in two headwater catchments one site each in hsx sh and jfz in the yrc one site in the upstream and one in the downstream of zt and one in xs in the tlc fig 1 all these six samples were defined as the hwss two additional sample sites were selected to study spatial variations in dom composition with one site located in the river month datong hydrological station dt of the changjiang river and another stream polluted by rural wastewater wsr located in a small stream receiving the urban wastewater effluent from yiwu city we designed two time points 16 00 and 04 00 the next day to sample and identified the daily changes of doc doc mg l 1 uv vis eem and ft icr ms the doc uv vis and eem were sampled in september and october and the ft icr ms was measured in october water samples were collected at 0 5 m below the water surface stored in clean 1000 ml polyethylene bottles taken to the laboratory within 24 h and refrigerated in dark conditions the samples were immediately filtered through pre combusted 0 7 μm glass fiber filter whatman gf f and filtered through precleaned 0 22 μm polycarbonate membrane filters millipore subsequently the filtrates were then stored at 4 c in the dark before further analysis we also estimated the er in the hwss based on the changes of dissolved oxygen do do mg l 1 and water temperature t using a multi parameter meter ysi 550a usa and the δ13cdic values were also sampled and measured at 14 00 and 04 00 the next day to observe daily changes gong et al 2021 2 2 spectroscopic analysis and parafac modeling uv vis and eem were obtained by a diode array spectrophotometer agilent 8453 and a fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi f7000 japan fig s1 parallel factor parafac analysis was used to analyze the optical data

o s and molecular formulas cho chon chos chons were obtained immediately and the change in dom composition can be semiquantitatively evaluated by relative peak intensity standardized as the sum of the peak intensity of the identified molecular formula calculation parameters included h c o c double bond equivalent dbe aiw the molecular instability index mlbl and carboxyl rich alicyclic compounds

to further reveal the variation of dom principal component analysis pca was also used to select from doc optical parameters and molecular parameters pearson correlation analysis was used to analyze the linear relationships between optical and molecular parameters of dom and the correlations between principal components and optical and molecular parameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 optical characteristics of dom and its spatial variation the average value of doc was 2 45 0 47 mg l 1 and uv254 was 0 06 0 01 cm 1 which were similar to those of dt 2 55 mg l 1 and 0 05 cm 1 and wsr 2 89 mg l 1 and 0 05 cm 1 table s1 but the suva values were 2 05 0 28 l mg c 1 m 1 in hwss 1 96 l mg c 1 m 1 in dt and 0 87 l mg c 1 m 1 in wsr indicating that the contents of cdom were similar in dt hwss and wsr but the aromaticity of cdom was significantly higher in hwss and dt than that in wsr the hix values of each sampling point were approximated with an average of 0 72 0 02 which were lower than those in soil 0 8 indicating that similar humification of dom and that higher effects of leached from the soil were observed in all sampling sites chen et al 2020a the fluorescence index fi can indicate the dom source 1 9 microbial source 1 4 terrestrial origin derrien et al 2019 fi values ranged from 1 49 to 2 01 in sampling sites indicating much dom derived from extracellular release and leachate from bacteria and microbial source than terrestrial source the bix 1 represents autochthonous input whereas the lower bix represents less contribution of freshly derived dom xu and guo 2017 we found bix values in hws were lower than 1 but significantly higher than that in dt indicating higher freshly derived dom in hws than that in dt the a355 values were calculated as a descriptor for the quantity of chromophoric dom cdom hansell and carlson 2015 these a355 values in hws were considerably higher than those in other natural water bodies and similar to that in wsr indicating that the hws was affected by sewage in addition the sr values which is a proxy for dom molecular weight in hws 0 87 0 16 were higher than that in wsr 0 76 and lower than that in dt 1 28 fig s3 table s1 revealing the relatively larger percentage of high molecular weight dom in hwss than dt liu et al 2020 we found no monthly differences in stream spectral parameters p 0 05 the spectral parameters described the impact of different sources on dom composition indicated the contribution of autochthonous and terrestrial dom in hws to be higher than that in dt and also reflected the anthropogenic effluent affect in hws four fluorescent components were identified by parafac openfluor including two protein like components c2 and c3 and two humic like c1 and c4 components fig s2 table s2 murphy et al 2014 specifically humic like component c1 ex em 280 235 395 nm was associated with low molecular weight microdegraded organisms which widely exist in wastewater and agricultural environments cory and mcknight 2005 murphy et al 2006 another humic like component c4 ex em 365 250 490 nm was similar to fulvic acid and widely exists in natural water table s2 murphy et al 2018 protein like component c2 ex em 275 230 340 nm was classified as tryptophan wang et al 2019 and c3 ex em 265 315 nm was classified as tyrosine consisting of amino acid free or amino acid bound proteins baker 2002 he et al 2020 we found no monthly differences for four parafaccomponents p 0 05 the contents of protein like components c2 and c3 were significantly higher than humic like components c1 and c4 the average relative proportions of c3 components in hws and wsr were lower than that of dt and the c2 component was the opposite two humic like components c1 and c4 had no spatial variations in all sampling sites table s1 and the four components had no spatial variations in yrc and tlc p 0 05 fig s4 human and animal excreta are rich in protein substances mainly composed of tryptophan and tyrosine wolfbeis 1985 these fluorescent components demonstrate that the anthropogenic effect in hws might be the reason of higher percentage of protein like dom 3 2 linking dom ft icr ms molecular signatures to the source material we used ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry to unambiguously identify 5595 to 8789 average 7668 733 molecular formulas in all sampling sites table 1 it was found that the molecular chemodiversity in hws dt and wsr did not change significantly the results were significantly higher than those of other studies in rivers wagner et al 2015 lakes kellerman et al 2014 ni et al 2021 reservoirs he et al 2020 and streams mosher et al 2015 from 3053 to 6818 average 4647 1088 the significantly increased dom molecular diversity may be affected by factors such as river size grade and human activities in this study it was found that the chemodiversity of the changjiang river mainstream and hws was similar indicating that the higher chemodiversity had no significant correlation with the river order and river size fig s5 and table 1 the possible reason for the high chemodiversity was the input of a large amount of anthropogenic dom casas ruiz et al 2020 mosher et al 2015 however it was found that the number of identified molecules had a significant positive correlation with the s atom intensity n 16 p 0 05 fig s6 therefore the high chemical diversity of dom in the hws was caused by anthropogenic sewage input principal component analysis pca was used to analyze the spatial variation of different dom compounds and various indicators fig s7 we observed that the doc uv254 and the indicators and components obtained from eem and ft icr ms had no spatial change in yrc and tlc fig s8 and s9 the first principal component dim1 explained 62 5 of the variance and was significantly correlated with h c n 14 r 0 601 p 0 05 chos compound abundance n 14 r 0 678 p 0 05 s atom intensity n 14 r 0 679 p 0 05 c2 n 14 r 0 36 p 0 05 and c3 component n 14 r 0 38 p 0 05 h c ratio s atom intensity and chos compound abundance were indicators of domestic wastewater lian et al 2020 so dim1 was controlled by the input of domestic wastewater fig s7 the relative abundance of chos was higher than other large rivers in the world the abundance in hws 13 16 3 63 was significantly higher than that in dt 7 26 and lower than that in wsr 38 83 fig 2 and the similarity of cho and chos in the lignin region of the hws dt and wsr was low fig s10 which indicated that most s containing compounds come from other sources i e anthropogenic effluence except the natural source gonsior et al 2011 qiu et al 2020 the abundances of the o3s and o5s classes of compounds in hwss were significantly higher than those of other classes of s containing compounds and other s containing compounds except o3s and o5s were distributed in gaussian distribution fig 3 the abundances of the o3s and o5s classes of compounds were significantly negatively correlated with o intensity n 14 p 0 01 and significantly positively correlated with the c2 component n 14 p 0 05 indicating that a large number of linear alkylbenzene sulfonates las existed in domestic sewage contaminated water was inputted into the hws melendez perez et al 2018 las is likely associated with the content of o3s component and is an anionic surfactant which is most widely used surfactants in detergents in china derrien et al 2019 mungray and kumar 2009 and the o5s compounds could be generated by the degradation of las under aerobic conditions salmani et al 2021 the abundance on o3s and o5s classes of compounds accounted for 0 38 of the total chos intensitiy in hws 0 30 in dt and 0 45 in wsr table 2 suggesting an increasing level of anthropogenic input in dt hwss and wsr in agreement with the same increasing fluorescence intensity of c2 component table s1 in addition the markers table s3 of sewage including lipid drugs and antibiotics were also selected to study the impact of rural sewage in hws fig s11 although ft icr ms cannot accurately identify molecular structure it can accurately identify molecular weight the identification of markers was based on the molecular formula and it is considered that molecules with the same molecular formula were possible molecules we observed the same formulas with nalidixic acid gemfibrozil ketoprofen estrone estradiol and estriol in hws fig s11 and table s3 molecular of the target pollutants and corresponding information were collected from the chinese medical statistical yearbook 2008 two common dom industrial production intermediates were selected sunset yellow from food coloring yang et al 2017 and 4 hydroxybenzenesulfonate from the pharmaceutical industry wang et al 2020 sunset yellow and 4 hydroxybenzenesulfonate were not found in hws but were found in wsr therefore the hws was only affected by domestic sewage and was almost unaffected by industrial pollution the c2 component relative abundance of the o3s and o5s and markers i e antibiotics drugs and hormones can be used to evaluate the effect of domestic sewage pca showed that dim2 explained 17 3 of the variance and was positively correlated with crams n 14 r 0 62 p 0 05 and hu n 14 r 0 56 p 0 05 fig s7 the relative abundances of crams and hu are mainly produced by recalcitrant molecules that were from soils or higher plants and lignin metabolism and therefore indicate terrestrial dom sources lechtenfeld et al 2014 wagner et al 2015 therefore the relationship between these two molecular parameters along dim2 may reflect the relative contribution of recalcitrant molecules from terrigenous features or higher plants bahureksa et al 2021 ware et al 2022 the content of cho was highest in different compounds and the average value in hws 68 63 3 56 was similar to that in dt 72 85 which was higher than that of wsr 48 12 table 1 the cho compounds showed gaussian distribution indicating a similar origin and precursor structure of cho compounds in all sampling sites fig 3 melendez perez et al 2016 due to a large number of carboxyl carbonyl and or hydroxyl functional groups aromatic dom has high solubility in water and most of them are distributed in the water column liu et al 2021 seidel et al 2015 the higher the aiw value is the more aromatic components there are in dom and the greater input of terrestrial or large vascular plants jaffe et al 2013 medeiros et al 2016 the aiw value of the algae dominated aquatic environment was less than 0 11 lee et al 2019b the relative abundances of pa polyphenols and aiw values which indicated the input of terrestrial or large vascular plants in hws were higher than that in dt wsr and other studies i e the three gorges pang et al 2021 the pearl river liu et al 2020 and other large rivers in the world wagner et al 2015 bix in hws decreased and suva and hix increased due to the large input of aromatic and humic dom table s1 lee et al 2019b yoon and raymond 2012 therefore relatively more allochthonous dom was introduced into the hws due to their proximity to terrestrial sources molecular formulas depleted in o and enriched in h with lower aiw may be derived from autochthonous sources koch and dittmar 2006 ware et al 2022 and are generally categorized as unsaturated aliphatics and peptides which were usually considered as fresh and labile molecules he et al 2019 although these compounds have also been identified in soil solutions derived from secondary plant metabolites and or soil microbes jimenez morillo et al 2018 we observed relatively higher abundances of unsaturated aliphatic and peptides in hws than that in dt fig s12 table 2 the aiw values in hws were also higher than that in dt table 1 which might influence by the input of terrestrial or large vascular plants lee et al 2019a indicating that slower water velocity and sufficient organic n in hws gong et al 2021 xu and guo 2017 were beneficial to autochthonous dom 3 3 transformations of chemical properties and biogeochemical reactivity in the hws although the same molecular composition may be different due to different functional groups to simplify the analysis it was assumed that the same molecular formula was the same substance the molecular formula extracted by ft icr ms contains the degraded components and intermediates generated during the degradation process figs 4 and 5 additionally it was assumed that there was no input of other pollutants within a day and that changes in dom were controlled only by river processes it should be recognized that ft icr ms identification was selective and the unknown number of molecules falls outside the analysis window not every mineralization and degradation product can be identified so the identified degradation products may not be the sum of unstable degradation compounds identified in the original sample leyva et al 2019 however the molecular formula determined by ft icr ms was important for the preliminary estimation of the dom degradation process the photodegradation and respiration of dom will occur within hours so a large proportion of degradable dom will be degraded at a daily scale bernhardt et al 2018 lv et al 2019 microbial degradation and photodegradation can directly mineralize highly unsaturated dom into co2 sawakuchi et al 2020 seidel et al 2015 or indirectly mineralize it into low molecular weight dom cory and kling 2018 hansen et al 2016 the average doc was 2 51 0 48 mg c l 1 in the daytime and 2 39 0 45 mg c l 1 in the nighttime there were obvious daily changes in suva sr and c2 component n 12 p 0 05 while other indicators and components showed no daily variations p 0 05 the decrease of suva and sr indicated the decrease of dom aromaticity after degradation the sr mlbl dbe abundances of hu and s containing compounds increased n 6 p 0 05 while the suva mw abundances of aliphatic peptide and aromatic groups decreased after degradation n 6 p 0 05 fig s13 table s1 these indicators obtained from ft icr ms had similar changes with those from uv vis and eem and can also be proven through the uv vis and eem the changes of pa and hu components extracted from the degradable dom components which were mainly tannins or lignin and their degradation products were mainly changed through photodegradation d andrilli et al 2015 textor et al 2019 the significantly daily changes of c2 component indicate the process of biodegradation n 12 p 0 05 ua and peptides are generally biologically unstable and their contents are also decreased compared with those before degradation significant positive correlations between er and aliphatic and peptide compounds were found n 6 p 0 05 indicating that aliphatic and peptide compounds promoted river microbial respiration antony et al 2017 zark and dittmar 2018 we also compared the kmd of unique dom in hws before and after daily degradation and found that the intensity of kmd peaks shifted to lower mw significantly fig s14 because the number of oxygen atoms as well as rings and double bonds increase monotonically with kmd wang et al 2021 homologs shifting towards lower mw could be explained by substitution of alkyl chain which represented the difference in dom aliphaticity jimenez morillo et al 2018 it also showed that dom in hws has undergone obvious microbial degradation processes which generally occurs in the mw range of 400 600 da fig s14 higher sewage input increased the content of heteroatoms s geng et al 2018 and significantly affected the transformation and degradation of dom in streams bittar et al 2015 for example the las input from domestic sewage will lead to the increase of the intensity of s atom lian et al 2020 lignin cho compounds can form chos compounds with s atoms through abiotic pathways melendez perez et al 2016 therefore the degradability of dom and drinking water quality in streams will further be affected above all photodegradation microbial degradation and the input of human domestic sewage jointly affect the processes of dom transformation in the river network after degradation dom was transformed into smaller and more refractory molecules which would have a significant impact on the treatment of drinking water fig 6 kellerman et al 2018 lechtenfeld et al 2014 3 4 identifying the refractory molecules in hws and the implications for drinking water treatment from upstream to downstream of the river the degradability of dom decreased gradually therefore the dom at the outlet of the river system can represent the collection of refractory dom in the whole basin li et al 2021 osburn et al 2016 in this study the regional heterogeneity of dom and the supplementation of degradable dom were ignored and it was contended that the dom of the dt station could represent the refractory dom pool in the river network qiu et al 2020 the refractory dom pool contained a total of 1085 molecular formulas in hws with an average h c value of 1 07 and an o c value of 0 37 fig 6a the mw value of the refractory dom pool was 151 635 da which was similar to the 250 550 da found in previous studies of the three gorges reservoir pang et al 2021 the markers i e nalidixic acid ketoprofen and estriol identified for the input of domestic sewage were found in the refractory dom pool table s3 it indicates that antibiotics or estrogenic imported through resident sewage are difficult to be degraded in the natural environment and the general molecular weight is 300 da however chow et al 2008 studied the removal efficiency of a series of molecular weight dom and found that dom of 300 500 da was extremely difficult to remove wang et al 2021 therefore part of the dom inputted from anthropogenic discharge was difficult to be degraded and had a small molecular weight that was difficult to be removed through traditional drinking water treatment processes which will have a significant impact on drinking water quality the o c and h c ranges of dbps obtained by ft icr ms were 0 3 0 7 and 0 7 1 4 respectively and the molecular weight ranges were 300 500 da andersson et al 2019 meanwhile ft icr ms showed that there was a high intensity of dbps precursors in the refractory pool of hws fig 6b and the dbps precursors primarily originated from terrestrial dom with high aromaticity and low mw fig 6 thus the removal of these precursors is critical for reducing the formation of dbps and the water quality of the drinking water overall preventing the formation of dbps in drinking water treatment processes and preventing the anthropogenic discharge input will play significant roles in drinking water safety korshin and yan 2018 4 conclusions in this study various optical and fluorescence components and parameters were detected by ft icr ms and 3d eem spectroscopy four eem components including two humic like and two protein like compounds were obtained by parallel factor analysis hu and polyphenols are two main chemical constituents of dom accounting for 80 5 91 2 ua and peptides accounted for a relatively small proportion but they were the main chemical components reflecting dom differences in different aquatic ecosystems relatively more terrestrial dom with higher aromaticity and humification degree more autochthonous dom and more anthropogenic dom in hws than those in large river dt were revealed by ft icr ms and biomarkers analysis from domestic sewage and industrial wastewater these significant variations in dom chemistry has mainly resulted from the input of domestic sewage its greater proximity to terrestrial and special hydrological characteristics i e shallow stream depth and slow flow rate in situ daily dom degradation experiments showed that mw suva and hix decreased and dbe s containing compounds hu ua and peptides increased while proteins and lipids decreased after degradation and the kmd plots before and after daily degradation provided that the homologous series were degraded through biodegradation these variations indicate that significant photodegradation and biodegradation processes happened in hws and the biodegradation mainly occurred in the mw range of 400 600 da the mw value of the refractory dom pool was 151 635 da which is considered difficult to remove during drinking water treatment the same molecular formula as the commonly used antibiotics and estrogen markers we selected exists in the refractory dom pool and the molecular weight is 300 da which is difficult to be removed and has a significant impact on water quality in addition a large number of refractory dom are mainly composed of lignin compounds which are important precursors of dbps in the drinking water disinfection process therefore preventing the formation of dbps in drinking water treatment processes and preventing the anthropogenic discharge input will play significantly roles in drinking water safety declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

16323,algal blooms and eutrophication in natural surface water not only pose a threat to human health but also adversely affect the water purification process ultrafiltration uf has been proved to be effective for the retention of algal cells but its further application is still restricted by the relatively limited removal of algal organics and membrane fouling to enhance the uf performance a synergistic process using calcium peroxide and ferrous sulfate cao2 feso4 was proposed for the treatment of microcystis aeruginosa laden water the results suggested that the removal of algal cells and organics fluorescent components were effectively increased with the synergism of cao2 and feso4 the particle size distribution and morphology revealed that the size of algal pollutants apparently increased due to the formation of algal flocs with cao2 feso4 pretreatment the terminal specific flux of polyethersulfone and polyvinylidene fluoride membranes were increased by 75 0 and 56 5 individually the fouling resistances were significantly reduced and the fouling mechanism transition to cake filtration was delayed the membrane interface properties including morphologies and functional groups were characterized further verifying the effectiveness the in situ formed fe3 integrated with ca oh 2 showed excellent coagulation effect thus promoting the agglomeration of algal foulants simultaneously the generated hydroxyl radical could improve the oxidative degradation of algal organics in conclusion the cao2 feso4 strategy has great advantages and application prospects in enhancing uf performance for microcystis aeruginosa laden water treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords algae laden water treatment calcium peroxide ferrous sulfate cao2 feso4 membrane fouling algal organics enhancing mechanism 1 introduction algae blooms in freshwater resources could induce numerous adverse effects to the aquatic ecosystem to be specific algae could release odor substances such as geosmin and 2 methyl isoborneol causing severe off flavors in drinking water qi et al 2018 simultaneously many dissolved organic substances could be released during algae growth and metabolism easily forming disinfection by products in the subsequent process of chlorine disinfection dixon et al 2011 moreover algae blooms could also adversely affect the water purification process e g increase of coagulant dosage decrease of water production and leakage of algae into the pipe network etc henderson et al 2008 ultrafiltration uf membranes have a high removal rate of algae cells without damaging the cells integrity yan et al 2017 nevertheless algal cells and the organic matters secreted during growth and metabolism could block the membrane pores inducing serious membrane contamination her et al 2004 the previous research qu et al 2012 proposed that extracellular organics could fill the gaps between algal cells contributing to the formation of cake layer and serious membrane fouling it has been noted that membrane fouling especially the irreversible fouling not only led to the increase of energy consumption but also reduced the service life of membrane kimura et al 2008 pretreatments including oxidation cheng et al 2018 coagulation du et al 2020 and adsorption xing et al 2019 etc have been proven to be valid in the mitigation of membrane fouling among which pre oxidation has been widely studied as an efficient method to mitigate algal fouling wei et al 2016 qu et al 2015 found that the in situ generated mno2 during kmno4 oxidation could significantly improve cell sedimentation thus effectively slowing down the flux drop and mitigating irreversible fouling he et al 2021 concluded that fe vi could reduce membrane fouling by disrupting algal cells and forming ferri hydr oxides to aggregate cell debris ren et al 2020 proposed a membrane pretreatment with ferrous ion sodium percarbonate which effectively increased the membrane flux and reduced the fouling resistance it should be noted that strong oxidants should be carefully used to avoid the release of algae toxins and intracellular organics caused by cells rupture recently calcium peroxide cao2 has attracted increasing attention for water purification and pollution control to be specific cao2 is considered as a solid h2o2 with the redox potential of 1 776 ev jiang and lloyd 2002 in comparison with liquid h2o2 cao2 is more stable in aquatic solution and h2o2 can be slowly released over a relatively long time xue et al 2020 kim et al 2021 reported that the combination of pyrite and cao2 could effectively degrade sulfanilamide in groundwater the persulfate cao2 system was also investigated to degrade polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons showing a removal rate of 70 8 wang et al 2021 in comparison with ozone chlorine and other oxidizing agents the oxidation capacity of cao2 is relatively moderate xin et al 2020 xue et al 2018 which contributes to maintain the integrity of algal cells when cao2 is dissolved in water h2o2 could be released accompanied by the formation of ca oh 2 interestingly hydroxyl radical oh with strong oxidation effect could be produced in the synergistic process of cao2 and ferrous iron fe2 xue et al 2018 simultaneously iron salts exhibited excellent coagulation effect for algal pollutants and the generated ca oh 2 could also promote the coagulation performance of iron salts as an essential element for human body ca2 with no biological toxicity is safe enough in aquatic environment zhou et al 2017 therefore the synergistic process of cao2 and fe2 exhibits certain application prospects to improve the uf performance for algal removal and relevant studies need to be systematically carried out in this work the effect and mechanism of the cao2 feso4 process for enhanced uf of microcystis aeruginosa laden water were investigated firstly the effect of cao2 feso4 on the permeate water quality was investigated and the characterization of algae laden water was performed to elucidate the changes in pollutants properties during the synergistic process furtherly the membrane fouling conditions were evaluated by membrane flux measurement fouling resistance analysis and fouling mechanism analysis the interface properties including membrane surface morphologies and functional groups were characterized finally the mechanism for the enhanced uf performance was analyzed and discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents microcystis aeruginosa was used as the research object because it was one of the dominated algae species in the algae blooms lapointe et al 2015 the algae were cultured for 35 d in a light incubator gzx 436a ningbo jiangnan instrument factory with bg11 medium cheng et al 2021b and the growth of algal cells was monitored daily by measuring the optical density od at 685 nm qu et al 2015 the algae solution was diluted to 2 0 106 cells ml by a diluent consisting of 15 0 mmol l nacl 0 5 mmol l cacl2 and 1 0 mmol l nahco3 to obtain microcystis aeruginosa laden water liu et al 2017 in this work cao2 was prepared by reacting cacl2 with h2o2 under alkaline conditions specifically 5 g cacl2 was added to 20 ml milli q water followed by adding 10 ml naoh 6 mol l and 5 ml concentrated ammonia during subsequent stirring process 10 ml h2o2 was slowly added to the solution to generate cao2 the purity of cao2 was calibrated by kmno4 after drying at 40 c for 30 min 2 2 experimental setup the synergistic process was carried out by simultaneously adding certain feso4 and cao2 to the algae laden water a total of six sequences were set as follows raw water 20 mg l of cao2 denoted as ca 20 mg l of feso4 denoted as fe 5 mg l of cao2 and 20 mg l of feso4 denoted as ca fe 1 10 mg l of cao2 and 20 mg l of feso4 denoted as ca fe 2 20 mg l of cao2 and 20 mg l of feso4 denoted as ca fe 3 noted that the dosage of cao2 was determined as 5 10 and 20 mg l which were optimal doses chosen from preliminary experiment to be specific the effectiveness of cao2 was insignificant when the dosage was lower than 5 mg l and excessive dosage of cao2 20 mg l could not further improve the performance the reaction conditions were controlled as 300 r min for 1 min followed by 150 r min for 15 min and then the water samples were collected for subsequent filtration in the uf experiment polyethersulfone pes and polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes 150 kda were used the uf system fig s1 consisted of a nitrogen cylinder providing a pressure of 0 05 mpa a filtration cell msc 300 mosu china and an electronic balance hua zhi connecticut usa connected to a data recording system before using the virgin membrane was soaked in ethanol solution 50 for 20 min to dissolve the organic preservatives on the membrane and then soaked in milli q water for reserve the pure water flux was determined by filtering milli q water until the flux stabilized and then 300 ml of the pre treated water sample was filtered after filtration the milli q water was filtered again until the flux was stabilized for fouling resistance analysis during backwashing the uf membrane was inverted and the pressure was maintained at 0 10 mpa to force 100 ml of ultrapure water through the uf membrane within 2 min to flush the pollutants accumulated on the membrane surface liu et al 2015 2 3 membrane fouling evaluation the curve of specific flux j j0 changing with filtration volume was drawn to reflect the decrease of membrane flux in the uf process fouling resistance consisted of membrane inherent resistance reversible fouling resistance and irreversible fouling resistance yan et al 2017 the calculation of fouling resistance was based on the series resistance model of darcy formula cheng et al 2017 tian et al 2013 and membrane fouling mechanism was evaluated using the membrane pore blockage cake filtration model li et al 2020 specific analysis methods have been described in previous studies cheng et al 2021a 2018 2 4 analytical methods the values of uv254 and od represent the contents of unsaturated organic matter and algal cells which can be measured by uv visible photometer uv 1800 mapada shanghai dissolved organic carbon doc was tested by the total organic carbon analyzer toc l cph shimadzu japan fluorescent organic components were measured by molecular fluorescence spectrometer f 7100 hitachi japan with the following scanning parameters excitation wavelength of 200 450 nm with a scanning interval of 5 nm emission wavelength of 220 550 nm with a scanning interval of 5 nm molecular weight distribution of organics was measured by a high performance liquid chromatograph waters e2695 usa with an ultraviolet absorption detector waters 2486 usa the particle size distributions of algal flocs were measured by a laser particle size meter bettersize 2600 dandong baxter china an attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir spectrum one b perkin elmer usa was used to qualitatively analyze the functional groups in the pollutants with a scanning range of 4000 500 cm 1 and a resolution of 1 cm 1 zeta potential was measured by a particle size analysis and zeta potential tester zetasizer nano zs malvin usa the morphologies of flocs were observed by the biological microscope bx53 olympus japan a thermal field emission scanning electron microscope sem jsm 7610f plus japan electronics co ltd japan was utilized to observe the membrane surface micromorphology prior to observation the dried membranes were placed on a copper column followed by spraying gold on the samples using ion sputtering coating apparatus jec 3000fc jeol japan 3 results and discussions 3 1 permeate water quality the permeate water quality i e algal cells uv254 and doc in varying processes were investigated as depicted in fig 1 a only 4 4 and 2 0 of algal cells were removed when cao2 and feso4 were applied alone while 54 4 57 4 and 55 9 of removal rates were achieved for the combination of cao2 and feso4 since the average size of algal cells is much larger than membrane pore size most of the algal cells can be trapped by the membrane zhao et al 2017 thus both pes and pvdf membranes could reject more than 90 algal cells for all water samples since cao2 feso4 could effectively remove algal cells from raw water the loading of subsequent uf could be significantly reduced and the removal rate was further increased with respect to uv254 there is a correlation between uv254 and a variety of organic micro pollutants altmann et al 2016 as illustrated in fig 1 b the uv254 in algae laden water was 0 179 au and the removing efficiencies by cao2 and feso4 alone were 48 6 and 40 8 respectively a higher removal rate was achieved with the increase of cao2 dosage in the co existence of cao2 and feso4 and the removal rate was increased to 51 4 for ca fe 3 for feed water pes and pvdf membranes exhibited similar rejection performance with the permeate uv254 values of 0 127 and 0 130 au respectively with ca fe 2 pretreating the permeate uv254 was removed by 40 0 and 33 3 for pes and pvdf membranes individually it is clearly seen in fig 1 c that the doc concentration in raw water was 5 1 mg l and the removing efficiencies of cao2 and feso4 alone were only 15 3 and 12 5 respectively with cao2 feso4 pretreatment the doc values were reduced to 2 3 2 4 mg l manifesting that the synergistic treatment has superior ability to remove algal organics it seemed that different cao2 doses did not cause apparent changes in the doc removal on the one hand the increase of cao2 could enhance the oxidation effect which was beneficial to the reduction of algal organics on the other hand excess cao2 could also release bound organics attached on the cells into the water thus to some extent increasing the concentration of organics to this end these two effects counteracted each other and different cao2 doses did not cause apparent changes with respect to the membrane material pes and pvdf membranes showed similar intercept ability of doc with the doc removal efficiencies of 19 0 and 17 1 respectively the doc of permeated water reached to 1 7 1 9 mg l with the synergistic effect of cao2 and feso4 overall the cao2 feso4 pretreatment could improve the feed and permeate water quality through enhancing the removal of algal cells and organic pollutants 3 2 characterization of microcystis aeruginosa laden water 3 2 1 fluorescent organic components the three dimensional fluorescence spectra of microcystis aeruginosa laden water with different treatments are shown in fig 2 evidently the fluorescence spectra of algal water exhibited three distinct characteristic peaks of t a and c to be specific the peak t represents tryptophan like protein substances while peaks a and c suggest the presence of humus substances liu et al 2011 when applying single cao2 treatment the intensity of peak t was obviously decreased with the removal rate of 22 9 while the peak intensities of a and c were even slightly increased likely because protein substances were oxidized to form small molecule organic matter such as humus substances different from cao2 feso4 coagulation preferentially removed protein substances with the peak t disappeared while the reduction rates of peaks a and c were relatively lower the fluorescent organic matter was removed significantly with peaks t and a disappeared after the treatment of ca fe 1 as the cao2 dosage increased the intensities of peaks a and c were slightly increased likely because more macromolecular protein like substances were decomposed by cao2 forming micromolecular humic like substances fig 2 g r illustrates the fluorescence spectra of the filtered water by pes and pvdf membranes after various pretreatments regarding raw water the peak t was significantly weakened after filtration while the changes of peaks a and c were insignificant suggesting protein substances were preferentially removed by uf rather than humic like substances with cao2 feso4 pretreatments the spectra of permeate water was similar to that of the feed 3 2 2 algal organics with varying molecular weights the changes of algal organics with varying molecular weights in the combined process are presented in fig 3 as seen in the raw water the characteristic peaks of biopolymers and humics were detected her et al 2002 huber et al 2011 with cao2 oxidation not only the biopolymers were converted to humics but also the peak of low molecular weight appeared indicating that the organics with higher molecular weight were transformed into small molecular fractions by oxidative degradation after coagulation with feso4 the response for biopolymers was greatly reduced indicating that the biopolymers with high molecular weight could be substantially removed by coagulation similar results were obtained for cao2 feso4 pretreatments and the peak intensities for humics obviously increased with the increasing of cao2 dose more macromolecular organics were transformed to low molecular weight matter overall cao2 feso4 could reduce the proportion of macromolecular biopolymers and promote the formation of humics and low molecular weight organic matter 3 2 3 particle size distribution it was clearly observed in fig 4 that the particle size of microcystis aeruginosa laden water ranged from 1 to 8 μm which was consistent with the previous study kwon et al 2005 a minor variation in the particle size distribution was noticed by feso4 coagulation alone with the range varied from 1 to 10 μm while a small peak was appeared at 9 23 μm attributed to cao2 oxidation the synergistic treatments using cao2 feso4 increased the size of algal flocs to a greater extent and the distribution was extended to a larger range the peak intensity at 1 8 μm was lowest with ca fe 2 treatment and a new peak appeared in the range of 50 1000 μm as observed in fig s2 the particle size was significantly increased by cao2 feso4 treatment suggesting the agglomeration of algal foulants and the formation of algal flocs it was noteworthy that fe2 could be oxidized to form fe3 which played a coagulation role and promoted the formation of flocs in the meanwhile the generated ca oh 2 was also conductive to coagulation thus promoting the formation of algal flocs with larger particle size and higher strength dong et al 2012 however as the cao2 dosage increased to 20 mg l more macromolecular protein like substances were decomposed by oxidation forming micromolecular humic like substances it should be noted that humics with small molecular weight was difficult to be removed and exhibited an adverse influence on coagulation therefore the size of flocs was slightly decreased when the cao2 dosage was further increased to 20 mg l 3 2 4 morphology of the algal flocs fig 5 shows the morphology of algal flocs with varying treatments the algal cells in the raw water were approximately circular and evenly dispersed fig 5 a and the morphology of algal cells changed little after cao2 oxidation fig 5 b the algal cells were obviously aggregated to form algal flocs after coagulation with feso4 as displayed in fig 5 c regarding the synergistic treatment of cao2 feso4 with different dosages the algal flocs formed were large in size and the arrangement of algal cells was relatively dense the results were consistent with the distributions of particle size indicating that the synergistic effect of cao2 and feso4 could aggregate algal cells to form larger and denser flocs 3 3 membrane fouling conditions 3 3 1 flux variation fig 6 shows the membrane flux variation during filtration with pes and pvdf membranes regarding the pes membrane fig 6 a the algae laden water caused an extremely serious drop in membrane flux with the final specific flux of 0 12 the effect of cao2 oxidation alone on relieving the decrease in membrane flux was not considerable with the terminal flux changed little different from cao2 feso4 coagulation exhibited a certain effect for promoting membrane flux and the terminal specific flux was increased to 0 58 it was obvious to notice that the co existence of feso4 and cao2 produced significant better performance on flux improvement specifically the final specific fluxes were 0 62 0 87 and 0 75 with the cao2 dosages of 5 10 and 20 mg l respectively it could be concluded that the combination of 10 mg l cao2 and 20 mg l feso4 showed the best effect on relieving the decline of membrane flux as shown in fig 6 b the decrease of permeate flux for pvdf membrane presented a different trend with pes membrane and more serious flux decline was noticed with the specific flux of 0 075 after filtrating raw water thus the flux drop of pvdf membrane was much more severe than pes membrane especially a sudden decline of permeate flux was occurred at the beginning of the filtration this phenomenon might be interpreted by the stronger hydrophobicity of pvdf membrane and the membrane pore was more likely to be blocked by algal foulants resulting in a more serious flux drop pezeshk et al 2012 zhao et al 2012 the cao2 and feso4 pretreatment alone exerted no significant effect on the flux improvement with the final specific flux of 0 18 and 0 28 individually similar with pes membrane the flux improvement of pvdf membrane by cao2 feso4 pretreatment was also significant and the terminal normalized flux was increased to 0 48 0 64 and 0 60 respectively 3 3 2 fouling resistance distribution fig 7 illustrates the effect of various pretreatments on the fouling resistances for pes and pvdf membranes the fouling resistances caused by raw water were 2 45 and 2 63 1012 m 1 respectively to be specific the reversible fouling resistance accounted for 98 2 and 82 7 which suggested that the fouling induced by algae laden water was mainly reversible fouling there was no noticeable impact on the fouling resistance of pes membrane by cao2 alone relieving only 7 0 of the total fouling resistance conversely a significant alleviation effect on the fouling resistance of pvdf membrane was observed to be specific the total fouling resistance was reduced by 62 3 with the reversible and irreversible resistances reduced to 0 71 and 0 29 1012 m 1 respectively it was noteworthy that membrane fouling was obviously mitigated by cao2 feso4 pretreatment regardless of the membrane material with pretreatment of ca fe 2 97 9 and 95 5 of the total fouling resistance were alleviated for pes and pvdf membranes respectively however further increase of the cao2 dosage would produce excess ca oh 2 precipitates which could also block the membrane pores and aggravate membrane fouling lin et al 2015 therefore the fouling resistances of pes and pvdf membranes were slightly increased when the cao2 dosage further increased to 20 mg l 3 3 3 fouling mechanism analysis the fitting result of the filtration data to the model was depicted in fig s3 it was apparent that the values of r2 were all above 0 99 indicating that the filtration model could effectively explain the fouling mechanisms related to the algal water during filtrating raw water by pes membrane the fouling mechanism experienced two different stages fig 8 a i e standard blockage with n value of 1 61 at the initial filtration stage and cake filtration after a filtration volume of 175 ml the reasonable explanation of this phenomenon was that algal organics could block membrane pores in the initial filtration stage resulting in the rapid decline of permeate flux at the later stage the membrane surfaces were deposited with algal cells and organics gradually forming a dense and porous cake layer single cao2 oxidation exhibited minor influence on the fouling mechanism and the mechanism turned to cake filtration after the volume of 190 ml the transformation to cake filtration was even earlier after the treatment of feso4 which may because of the rapid accumulation of algal flocs with the synergism of cao2 and feso4 the fouling mechanism transformation was delayed especially for ca fe 2 and ca fe 3 pretreatments the main fouling mechanism was intermediate blockage in the entire filtration process hence the combined pretreatment of cao2 and feso4 could effectively prolong the filtration volume acquired for mechanism transformation and delay the formation of cake layer filtration contributing to membrane fouling mitigation noted that pvdf membrane exhibited a higher hydrophobicity than pes membrane rendering it more susceptible to organics contamination as shown in fig 8 g the pvdf membrane filtration processes of all samples could be classified as three contiguous periods there existed a distinct stage with a negative n value which could be owing to the transition to cake filtration from pore blockage lee et al 2013 among all the pretreatment methods ca fe 2 exhibited the best effect and the filtration volume entering cake filtration was increased from approximately 20 ml to 100 ml overall cao2 feso4 pretreatment can effectively delay the shift from membrane pore blocking to cake filtration 3 4 interface properties of the membranes the ftir spectroscopy was utilized to determine the functional groups of membrane surfaces as can be seen from fig 9 when the membranes were fouled by raw water the characteristic peaks of the original membranes were weakened and the characteristic peaks of membrane foulants were available suggesting that the surfaces of membranes were covered by algal pollutants in the raw water the absorption peak around 1500 cm 1 is related to proteins and 2938 cm 1 is the absorption peak of ch bond the absorption peaks of 900 1200 cm 1 and 3200 3700 cm 1 are related to the vibration of oh and the response at 1650 cm 1 represents the co double bond the functional groups associated with the ch and co bonds are attributed to humic acid while the groups associated with oh and co bonds are assigned to polysaccharides lee et al 2004 a comparation of fig 9 a and b revealed that pes and pvdf membranes displayed a similar fouling condition there was little reduction in the characteristic peaks of pollutants on membrane surfaces when filtering samples pretreated by cao2 and feso4 alone in contrast the combination of cao2 and feso4 could effectively reduce the peak intensities of various pollutants and the reduction efficiency gradually increased with the increase of cao2 dosage with 20 mg l of cao2 and feso4 the ftir spectrum of membrane surface was almost consistent with the original membrane indicating that membrane foulants were effectively reduced as displayed in fig s4 and s5 the morphologies of the two kinds of membranes were similar and the membranes polluted by algae laden water were completely covered by dense algal cells and organic matter when the samples were pretreated by single cao2 and feso4 the fouling layers were still relatively dense on uf membranes however the membranes fouled by cao2 feso4 pretreated samples presented relatively loose and thin foulant layers indicating that the combined pretreatment of cao2 and feso4 could reduce the accumulation of algal foulants on the membrane surfaces and pores the microscopic morphologies of surfaces in the pristine and fouled membranes were observed by sem after treating the raw algal water the pristine membrane was completely covered by intact and orderly algal cells resulting in a dense cake layer fig 10 a it seemed that more pollutants were accumulated on the membrane surface by cao2 oxidation with many algal cells and ca oh 2 sediments clearly observed with respect to feso4 pre coagulation the number of algal cells conspicuously reduced and the membrane was not completely covered by the fouling layer suggesting coagulation could slow down the fouling process to a certain extent with cao2 feso4 pretreatment remarkable reduction in the quantity of algal cells deposited on the surface was noticed as shown in fig 10 d f the membrane surface displayed marked appearance with almost no algal cells when the raw water was pretreated by 20 mg l of cao2 and feso4 it was noted that no significant increase of doc and fluorescent organic components was observed during the cao2 feso4 process indicating that the decomposition of algal cell substances by oxidation was not obvious furthermore the cao2 feso4 strategy exhibited surpassing effect in increasing permeate flux and alleviating fouling suggesting that the deposition of algal foulants on membrane surfaces were significantly alleviated in conclusion the combination of cao2 and feso4 could reduce the accumulation and deposition of algal foulants 3 5 mechanisms for the enhanced performance the mechanisms for the enhanced performance of the cao2 feso4 process was elucidated as presented in fig 11 table s1 illustrates the principal reactions in the synergistic process to be specific ca oh 2 and h2o2 would be generated when cao2 was dissolved in the algal water among which ca oh 2 could coalesce small flocs into larger groups through adsorption bridging and net sweeping meanwhile h2o2 could not only oxidize organic matters to low molecular components but also facilitate subsequent coagulation efficiency wan et al 2019 on the other hand fe2 could activate h2o2 to generate oh thus enhancing the oxidative degradation of algal organics ren et al 2020 another point worth noting was that fe2 could be oxidized to form in situ fe3 which showed stronger coagulation efficiency than fe2 and ordinary fe3 therefore the surface potential of algal cells could be neutralized and the activity of algal cells was reduced resulting in the formation of algal flocs with larger volume and higher strength ma et al 2012 as illustrated in fig s6 the cao2 feso4 treatment could increase the zeta potential from 21 2 to 14 2 mv also indicating that the algal cells were more prone to agglomeration in conclusion the combination of cao2 and feso4 could agglomerate the algal cells and organics hence forming larger flocs compared with the dense cake layer formed in the filtration of raw water the fouling layer accumulated by flocs was sparser and more porous and the algal cells deposited on the surface was distinctly reduced liu et al 2018 with the pretreatment of cao2 feso4 the pollutants accumulated on the membrane could be reduced in this case the transformation of membrane fouling mechanism from pore blockage to cake filtration was delayed causing the increase of membrane flux and the mitigation of membrane fouling 4 conclusion in this work a novel cao2 feso4 strategy was proposed to enhance the uf performance for algae laden water purification and the following conclusions could be drawn 1 the synergistic effect of cao2 and feso4 could improve the feed and permeate water quality through enhancing the reduction of algal cells and organic pollutants the results of fluorescence spectra and molecular weight distributions indicated that macromolecular protein like substances were decomposed resulting in the generation of micromolecular humic like matters moreover the agglomeration of algal foulants was also promoted 2 the cao2 feso4 strategy showed surpassing effect in increasing permeate flux and alleviating fouling under the optimum conditions the final specific fluxes were improved by 75 0 and 56 5 and the total fouling resistances were reduced by 97 9 and 95 5 for pes and pvdf membranes respectively furthermore the transformation of fouling mechanism to cake filtration was significantly delayed 3 it can be verified from ftir spectroscopy and surface morphologies that cao2 feso4 pretreatment could alleviate the fouling of membrane by reducing the accumulation of algal pollutants on the membrane 4 in the synergistic process of cao2 and feso4 fe2 could activate h2o2 to generate oh thus enhancing the oxidative degradation of algal organics simultaneously fe2 could be oxidized by h2o2 thus forming fe3 to promote the agglomeration of algal cells in addition the generated ca oh 2 precipitates could also improve the coagulation effect of algal pollutants

16323,algal blooms and eutrophication in natural surface water not only pose a threat to human health but also adversely affect the water purification process ultrafiltration uf has been proved to be effective for the retention of algal cells but its further application is still restricted by the relatively limited removal of algal organics and membrane fouling to enhance the uf performance a synergistic process using calcium peroxide and ferrous sulfate cao2 feso4 was proposed for the treatment of microcystis aeruginosa laden water the results suggested that the removal of algal cells and organics fluorescent components were effectively increased with the synergism of cao2 and feso4 the particle size distribution and morphology revealed that the size of algal pollutants apparently increased due to the formation of algal flocs with cao2 feso4 pretreatment the terminal specific flux of polyethersulfone and polyvinylidene fluoride membranes were increased by 75 0 and 56 5 individually the fouling resistances were significantly reduced and the fouling mechanism transition to cake filtration was delayed the membrane interface properties including morphologies and functional groups were characterized further verifying the effectiveness the in situ formed fe3 integrated with ca oh 2 showed excellent coagulation effect thus promoting the agglomeration of algal foulants simultaneously the generated hydroxyl radical could improve the oxidative degradation of algal organics in conclusion the cao2 feso4 strategy has great advantages and application prospects in enhancing uf performance for microcystis aeruginosa laden water treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords algae laden water treatment calcium peroxide ferrous sulfate cao2 feso4 membrane fouling algal organics enhancing mechanism 1 introduction algae blooms in freshwater resources could induce numerous adverse effects to the aquatic ecosystem to be specific algae could release odor substances such as geosmin and 2 methyl isoborneol causing severe off flavors in drinking water qi et al 2018 simultaneously many dissolved organic substances could be released during algae growth and metabolism easily forming disinfection by products in the subsequent process of chlorine disinfection dixon et al 2011 moreover algae blooms could also adversely affect the water purification process e g increase of coagulant dosage decrease of water production and leakage of algae into the pipe network etc henderson et al 2008 ultrafiltration uf membranes have a high removal rate of algae cells without damaging the cells integrity yan et al 2017 nevertheless algal cells and the organic matters secreted during growth and metabolism could block the membrane pores inducing serious membrane contamination her et al 2004 the previous research qu et al 2012 proposed that extracellular organics could fill the gaps between algal cells contributing to the formation of cake layer and serious membrane fouling it has been noted that membrane fouling especially the irreversible fouling not only led to the increase of energy consumption but also reduced the service life of membrane kimura et al 2008 pretreatments including oxidation cheng et al 2018 coagulation du et al 2020 and adsorption xing et al 2019 etc have been proven to be valid in the mitigation of membrane fouling among which pre oxidation has been widely studied as an efficient method to mitigate algal fouling wei et al 2016 qu et al 2015 found that the in situ generated mno2 during kmno4 oxidation could significantly improve cell sedimentation thus effectively slowing down the flux drop and mitigating irreversible fouling he et al 2021 concluded that fe vi could reduce membrane fouling by disrupting algal cells and forming ferri hydr oxides to aggregate cell debris ren et al 2020 proposed a membrane pretreatment with ferrous ion sodium percarbonate which effectively increased the membrane flux and reduced the fouling resistance it should be noted that strong oxidants should be carefully used to avoid the release of algae toxins and intracellular organics caused by cells rupture recently calcium peroxide cao2 has attracted increasing attention for water purification and pollution control to be specific cao2 is considered as a solid h2o2 with the redox potential of 1 776 ev jiang and lloyd 2002 in comparison with liquid h2o2 cao2 is more stable in aquatic solution and h2o2 can be slowly released over a relatively long time xue et al 2020 kim et al 2021 reported that the combination of pyrite and cao2 could effectively degrade sulfanilamide in groundwater the persulfate cao2 system was also investigated to degrade polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons showing a removal rate of 70 8 wang et al 2021 in comparison with ozone chlorine and other oxidizing agents the oxidation capacity of cao2 is relatively moderate xin et al 2020 xue et al 2018 which contributes to maintain the integrity of algal cells when cao2 is dissolved in water h2o2 could be released accompanied by the formation of ca oh 2 interestingly hydroxyl radical oh with strong oxidation effect could be produced in the synergistic process of cao2 and ferrous iron fe2 xue et al 2018 simultaneously iron salts exhibited excellent coagulation effect for algal pollutants and the generated ca oh 2 could also promote the coagulation performance of iron salts as an essential element for human body ca2 with no biological toxicity is safe enough in aquatic environment zhou et al 2017 therefore the synergistic process of cao2 and fe2 exhibits certain application prospects to improve the uf performance for algal removal and relevant studies need to be systematically carried out in this work the effect and mechanism of the cao2 feso4 process for enhanced uf of microcystis aeruginosa laden water were investigated firstly the effect of cao2 feso4 on the permeate water quality was investigated and the characterization of algae laden water was performed to elucidate the changes in pollutants properties during the synergistic process furtherly the membrane fouling conditions were evaluated by membrane flux measurement fouling resistance analysis and fouling mechanism analysis the interface properties including membrane surface morphologies and functional groups were characterized finally the mechanism for the enhanced uf performance was analyzed and discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents microcystis aeruginosa was used as the research object because it was one of the dominated algae species in the algae blooms lapointe et al 2015 the algae were cultured for 35 d in a light incubator gzx 436a ningbo jiangnan instrument factory with bg11 medium cheng et al 2021b and the growth of algal cells was monitored daily by measuring the optical density od at 685 nm qu et al 2015 the algae solution was diluted to 2 0 106 cells ml by a diluent consisting of 15 0 mmol l nacl 0 5 mmol l cacl2 and 1 0 mmol l nahco3 to obtain microcystis aeruginosa laden water liu et al 2017 in this work cao2 was prepared by reacting cacl2 with h2o2 under alkaline conditions specifically 5 g cacl2 was added to 20 ml milli q water followed by adding 10 ml naoh 6 mol l and 5 ml concentrated ammonia during subsequent stirring process 10 ml h2o2 was slowly added to the solution to generate cao2 the purity of cao2 was calibrated by kmno4 after drying at 40 c for 30 min 2 2 experimental setup the synergistic process was carried out by simultaneously adding certain feso4 and cao2 to the algae laden water a total of six sequences were set as follows raw water 20 mg l of cao2 denoted as ca 20 mg l of feso4 denoted as fe 5 mg l of cao2 and 20 mg l of feso4 denoted as ca fe 1 10 mg l of cao2 and 20 mg l of feso4 denoted as ca fe 2 20 mg l of cao2 and 20 mg l of feso4 denoted as ca fe 3 noted that the dosage of cao2 was determined as 5 10 and 20 mg l which were optimal doses chosen from preliminary experiment to be specific the effectiveness of cao2 was insignificant when the dosage was lower than 5 mg l and excessive dosage of cao2 20 mg l could not further improve the performance the reaction conditions were controlled as 300 r min for 1 min followed by 150 r min for 15 min and then the water samples were collected for subsequent filtration in the uf experiment polyethersulfone pes and polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes 150 kda were used the uf system fig s1 consisted of a nitrogen cylinder providing a pressure of 0 05 mpa a filtration cell msc 300 mosu china and an electronic balance hua zhi connecticut usa connected to a data recording system before using the virgin membrane was soaked in ethanol solution 50 for 20 min to dissolve the organic preservatives on the membrane and then soaked in milli q water for reserve the pure water flux was determined by filtering milli q water until the flux stabilized and then 300 ml of the pre treated water sample was filtered after filtration the milli q water was filtered again until the flux was stabilized for fouling resistance analysis during backwashing the uf membrane was inverted and the pressure was maintained at 0 10 mpa to force 100 ml of ultrapure water through the uf membrane within 2 min to flush the pollutants accumulated on the membrane surface liu et al 2015 2 3 membrane fouling evaluation the curve of specific flux j j0 changing with filtration volume was drawn to reflect the decrease of membrane flux in the uf process fouling resistance consisted of membrane inherent resistance reversible fouling resistance and irreversible fouling resistance yan et al 2017 the calculation of fouling resistance was based on the series resistance model of darcy formula cheng et al 2017 tian et al 2013 and membrane fouling mechanism was evaluated using the membrane pore blockage cake filtration model li et al 2020 specific analysis methods have been described in previous studies cheng et al 2021a 2018 2 4 analytical methods the values of uv254 and od represent the contents of unsaturated organic matter and algal cells which can be measured by uv visible photometer uv 1800 mapada shanghai dissolved organic carbon doc was tested by the total organic carbon analyzer toc l cph shimadzu japan fluorescent organic components were measured by molecular fluorescence spectrometer f 7100 hitachi japan with the following scanning parameters excitation wavelength of 200 450 nm with a scanning interval of 5 nm emission wavelength of 220 550 nm with a

spectrum one b perkin elmer usa was used to qualitatively analyze the functional groups in the pollutants with a scanning range of 4000 500 cm 1 and a resolution of 1 cm 1 zeta potential was measured

scanning electron microscope sem jsm 7610f plus japan electronics co ltd japan was utilized to observe the membrane surface micromorphology prior to observation the dried membranes were placed on a copper column followed by spraying gold on the samples using ion sputtering coating apparatus jec 3000fc jeol japan 3 results and discussions 3 1 permeate water quality the permeate water quality i e algal cells uv254 and doc in varying processes were investigated as depicted in fig 1 a only 4 4 and 2 0 of algal cells were removed when cao2 and feso4 were applied alone while 54 4 57 4 and 55 9 of removal rates were achieved for the combination of cao2 and feso4 since the average size of algal cells is much larger than membrane pore size most of the algal cells can be trapped by the membrane zhao et al 2017 thus both pes and pvdf membranes could reject more than 90 algal cells for all water samples since cao2 feso4 could effectively remove algal cells from raw water the loading of subsequent uf could be significantly reduced and the removal rate was further increased with respect to uv254 there is a correlation between uv254 and a variety of organic micro pollutants altmann et al 2016 as illustrated in fig 1 b the uv254 in algae laden water was 0 179 au and the removing efficiencies by cao2 and feso4 alone were 48 6 and 40 8 respectively a higher removal rate was achieved with the increase of cao2 dosage in the co existence of cao2 and feso4 and the removal rate was increased to 51 4 for ca fe 3 for feed water pes and pvdf membranes exhibited similar rejection performance with the permeate uv254 values of 0 127 and 0 130 au respectively with ca fe 2 pretreating the permeate uv254 was removed by 40 0 and 33 3 for pes and pvdf membranes individually it is clearly seen in fig 1 c that the doc concentration in raw water was 5 1 mg l and the removing efficiencies of cao2 and feso4 alone were only 15 3 and 12 5 respectively with cao2 feso4 pretreatment the doc values were reduced to 2 3 2 4 mg l manifesting that the synergistic treatment has superior ability to remove algal organics it seemed that different cao2 doses did not cause apparent changes in the doc removal on the one hand the increase of cao2 could enhance the oxidation effect which was beneficial to the reduction of algal organics on the other hand excess cao2 could also release bound organics attached on the cells into the water thus to some extent increasing the concentration of organics to this end these two effects counteracted each other and different cao2 doses did not cause apparent changes with respect to the membrane material pes and pvdf membranes showed similar intercept ability of doc with the doc removal efficiencies of 19 0 and 17 1 respectively the doc of permeated water reached to 1 7 1 9 mg l with the synergistic effect of cao2 and feso4 overall the cao2 feso4 pretreatment could improve the feed and permeate water quality through enhancing the removal of algal cells and organic pollutants 3 2 characterization of microcystis aeruginosa laden water 3 2 1 fluorescent organic components the three dimensional fluorescence spectra of microcystis aeruginosa laden water with different treatments are shown in fig 2 evidently the fluorescence spectra of algal water exhibited three distinct characteristic peaks of t a and c to be specific the peak t represents tryptophan like protein substances while peaks a and c suggest the presence of humus substances liu et al 2011 when applying single cao2 treatment the intensity of peak t was obviously decreased with the removal rate of 22 9 while the peak intensities of a and c were even slightly increased likely because protein substances were oxidized to form small molecule organic matter such as humus substances different from cao2 feso4 coagulation preferentially removed protein substances with the peak t disappeared while the reduction rates of peaks a and c were relatively lower the fluorescent organic matter was removed significantly with peaks t and a disappeared after the treatment of ca fe 1 as the cao2 dosage increased the intensities of peaks a and c were slightly increased likely because more macromolecular protein like substances were decomposed by cao2 forming micromolecular humic like substances fig 2 g r illustrates the fluorescence spectra of the filtered water by pes and pvdf membranes after various pretreatments regarding raw water the peak t was significantly weakened after filtration while the changes of peaks a and c were insignificant suggesting protein substances were preferentially removed by uf rather than humic like substances with cao2 feso4 pretreatments the spectra of permeate water was similar to that of the feed 3 2 2 algal organics with varying molecular weights the changes of algal organics with varying molecular weights in the combined process are presented in fig 3 as seen in the raw water the characteristic peaks of biopolymers and humics were detected her et al 2002 huber et al 2011 with cao2 oxidation not only the biopolymers were converted to humics but also the peak of low molecular weight appeared indicating that the organics with higher molecular weight were transformed into small molecular fractions by oxidative degradation after coagulation with feso4 the response for biopolymers was greatly reduced indicating that the biopolymers with high molecular weight could be substantially removed by coagulation similar results were obtained for cao2 feso4 pretreatments and the peak intensities for humics obviously increased with the increasing of cao2 dose more macromolecular organics were transformed to low molecular weight matter overall cao2 feso4 could reduce the proportion of macromolecular biopolymers and promote the formation of humics and low molecular weight organic matter 3 2 3 particle size distribution it was clearly observed in fig 4 that the particle size of microcystis aeruginosa laden water ranged from 1 to 8 μm which was consistent with the previous study kwon et al 2005 a minor variation in the particle size distribution was noticed by feso4 coagulation alone with the range varied from 1 to 10 μm while a small peak was appeared at 9 23 μm attributed to cao2 oxidation the synergistic treatments using cao2 feso4 increased the size of algal flocs to a greater extent and the distribution was extended to a larger range the peak intensity at 1 8 μm was lowest with ca fe 2 treatment and a new peak appeared in the range of 50 1000 μm as observed in fig s2 the particle size was significantly increased by cao2 feso4 treatment suggesting the agglomeration of algal foulants and the formation of algal flocs it was noteworthy that fe2 could be oxidized to form fe3 which played a coagulation role and promoted the formation of flocs in the meanwhile the generated ca oh 2 was also conductive to coagulation thus promoting the formation of algal flocs with larger particle size and higher strength dong et al 2012 however as the cao2 dosage increased to 20 mg l more macromolecular protein like substances were decomposed by oxidation forming micromolecular humic like substances it should be noted that humics with small molecular weight was difficult to be removed and exhibited an adverse influence on coagulation therefore the size of flocs was slightly decreased when the cao2 dosage was further increased to 20 mg l 3 2 4 morphology of the algal flocs fig 5 shows the morphology of algal flocs with varying treatments the algal cells in the raw water were approximately circular and evenly dispersed fig 5 a and the morphology of algal cells changed little after cao2 oxidation fig 5 b the algal cells were obviously aggregated to form algal flocs after coagulation with feso4 as displayed in fig 5 c regarding the synergistic treatment of cao2 feso4 with different dosages the algal flocs formed were large in size and the arrangement of algal cells was relatively dense the results were consistent with the distributions of particle size indicating that the synergistic effect of cao2 and feso4 could aggregate algal cells to form larger and denser flocs 3 3 membrane fouling conditions 3 3 1 flux variation fig 6 shows the membrane flux variation during filtration with pes and pvdf membranes regarding the pes membrane fig 6 a the algae laden water caused an extremely serious drop in membrane flux with the final specific flux of 0 12 the effect of cao2 oxidation alone on relieving the decrease in membrane flux was not considerable with the terminal flux changed little different from cao2 feso4 coagulation exhibited a certain effect for promoting membrane flux and the terminal specific flux was increased to 0 58 it was obvious to notice that the co existence of feso4 and cao2 produced significant better performance on flux improvement specifically the final specific fluxes were 0 62 0 87 and 0 75 with the cao2 dosages of 5 10 and 20 mg l respectively it could be concluded that the combination of 10 mg l cao2 and 20 mg l feso4 showed the best effect on relieving the decline of membrane flux as shown in fig 6 b the decrease of permeate flux for pvdf membrane presented a different trend with pes membrane and more serious flux decline was noticed with the specific flux of 0 075 after filtrating raw water thus the flux drop of pvdf membrane was much more severe than pes membrane especially a sudden decline of permeate flux was occurred at the beginning of the filtration this phenomenon might be interpreted by the stronger hydrophobicity of pvdf membrane and the membrane pore was more likely to be blocked by algal foulants resulting in a more serious flux drop pezeshk et al 2012 zhao et al 2012 the cao2 and feso4 pretreatment alone exerted no significant effect on the flux improvement with the final specific flux of 0 18 and 0 28 individually similar with pes membrane the flux improvement of pvdf membrane by cao2 feso4 pretreatment was also significant and the terminal normalized flux was increased to 0 48 0 64 and 0 60 respectively 3 3 2 fouling resistance distribution fig 7 illustrates the effect of various pretreatments on the fouling resistances for pes and pvdf membranes the fouling resistances caused by raw water were 2 45 and 2 63 1012 m 1 respectively to be specific the reversible fouling resistance accounted for 98 2 and 82 7 which suggested that the fouling induced by algae laden water was mainly reversible fouling there was no noticeable impact on the fouling resistance of pes membrane by cao2 alone relieving only 7 0 of the total fouling resistance conversely a significant alleviation effect on the fouling resistance of pvdf membrane was observed to be specific the total fouling resistance was reduced by 62 3 with the reversible and irreversible resistances reduced to 0 71 and 0 29 1012 m 1 respectively it was noteworthy that membrane fouling was obviously mitigated by cao2 feso4 pretreatment regardless of the membrane material with pretreatment of ca fe 2 97 9 and 95 5 of the total fouling resistance were alleviated for pes and pvdf membranes respectively however further increase of the cao2 dosage would produce excess ca oh 2 precipitates which could also block the membrane pores and aggravate membrane fouling lin et al 2015 therefore the fouling resistances of pes and pvdf membranes were slightly increased when the cao2 dosage further increased to 20 mg l 3 3 3 fouling mechanism analysis the fitting result of the filtration data to the model was depicted in fig s3 it was apparent that the values of r2 were all above 0 99 indicating that the filtration model could effectively explain the fouling mechanisms related to the algal water during filtrating raw water by pes membrane the fouling mechanism experienced two different stages fig 8 a i e standard blockage with n value of 1 61 at the initial filtration stage and cake filtration after a filtration volume of 175 ml the reasonable explanation of this phenomenon was that algal organics could block membrane pores in the initial filtration stage resulting in the rapid decline of permeate flux at the later stage the membrane surfaces were deposited with algal cells and organics gradually forming a dense and porous cake layer single cao2 oxidation exhibited minor influence on the fouling mechanism and the mechanism turned to cake filtration after the volume of 190 ml the transformation to cake filtration was even earlier after the treatment of feso4 which may because of the rapid accumulation of algal flocs with the synergism of cao2 and feso4 the fouling mechanism transformation was delayed especially for ca fe 2 and ca fe 3 pretreatments the main fouling mechanism was intermediate blockage in the entire filtration process hence the combined pretreatment of cao2 and feso4 could effectively prolong the filtration volume acquired for mechanism transformation and delay the formation of cake layer filtration contributing to membrane fouling mitigation noted that pvdf membrane exhibited a higher hydrophobicity than pes membrane rendering it more susceptible to organics contamination as shown in fig 8 g the pvdf membrane filtration processes of all samples could be classified as three contiguous periods there existed a distinct stage with a negative n value which could be owing to the transition to cake filtration from pore blockage lee et al 2013 among all the pretreatment methods ca fe 2 exhibited the best effect and the filtration volume entering cake filtration was increased from approximately 20 ml to 100 ml overall cao2 feso4 pretreatment can effectively delay the shift from membrane pore blocking to cake filtration 3 4 interface properties of the membranes the ftir spectroscopy was utilized to determine the functional groups of membrane surfaces as can be seen from fig 9 when the membranes were fouled by raw water the characteristic peaks of the original membranes were weakened and the characteristic peaks of membrane foulants were available suggesting that the surfaces of membranes were covered by algal pollutants in the raw water the absorption peak around 1500 cm 1 is related to proteins and 2938 cm 1 is the absorption peak of ch bond the absorption peaks of 900 1200 cm 1 and 3200 3700 cm 1 are related to the vibration of oh and the response at 1650 cm 1 represents the co double bond the functional groups associated with the ch and co bonds are attributed to humic acid while the groups associated with oh and co bonds are assigned to polysaccharides lee et al 2004 a comparation of fig 9 a and b revealed that pes and pvdf membranes displayed a similar fouling condition there was little reduction in the characteristic peaks of pollutants on membrane surfaces when filtering samples pretreated by cao2 and feso4 alone in contrast the combination of cao2 and feso4 could effectively reduce the peak intensities of various pollutants and the reduction efficiency gradually increased with the increase of cao2 dosage with 20 mg l of cao2 and feso4 the ftir spectrum of membrane surface was almost consistent with the original membrane indicating that membrane foulants were effectively reduced as displayed in fig s4 and s5 the morphologies of the two kinds of membranes were similar and the membranes polluted by algae laden water were completely covered by dense algal cells and organic matter when the samples were pretreated by single cao2 and feso4 the fouling layers were still relatively dense on uf membranes however the membranes fouled by cao2 feso4 pretreated samples presented relatively loose and thin foulant layers indicating that the combined pretreatment of cao2 and feso4 could reduce the accumulation of algal foulants on the membrane surfaces and pores the microscopic morphologies of surfaces in the pristine and fouled membranes were observed by sem after treating the raw algal water the pristine membrane was completely covered by intact and orderly algal cells resulting in a dense cake layer fig 10 a it seemed that more pollutants were accumulated on the membrane surface by cao2 oxidation with many algal cells and ca oh 2 sediments clearly observed with respect to feso4 pre coagulation the number of algal cells conspicuously reduced and the membrane was not completely covered by the fouling layer suggesting coagulation could slow down the fouling process to a certain extent with cao2 feso4 pretreatment remarkable reduction in the quantity of algal cells deposited on the surface was noticed as shown in fig 10 d f the membrane surface displayed marked appearance with almost no algal cells when the raw water was pretreated by 20 mg l of cao2 and feso4 it was noted that no significant increase of doc and fluorescent organic components was observed during the cao2 feso4 process indicating that the decomposition of algal cell substances by oxidation was not obvious furthermore the cao2 feso4 strategy exhibited surpassing effect in increasing permeate flux and alleviating fouling suggesting that the deposition of algal foulants on membrane surfaces were significantly alleviated in conclusion the combination of cao2 and feso4 could reduce the accumulation and deposition of algal foulants 3 5 mechanisms for the enhanced performance the mechanisms for the enhanced performance of the cao2 feso4 process was elucidated as presented in fig 11 table s1 illustrates the principal reactions in the synergistic process to be specific ca oh 2 and h2o2 would be generated when cao2 was dissolved in the algal water among which ca oh 2 could coalesce small flocs into larger groups through adsorption bridging and net sweeping meanwhile h2o2 could not only oxidize organic matters to low molecular components but also facilitate subsequent coagulation efficiency wan et al 2019 on the other hand fe2 could activate h2o2 to generate oh thus enhancing the oxidative degradation of algal organics ren et al 2020 another point worth noting was that fe2 could be oxidized to form in situ fe3 which showed stronger coagulation efficiency than fe2 and ordinary fe3 therefore the surface potential of algal cells could be neutralized and the activity of algal cells was reduced resulting in the formation of algal flocs with larger volume and higher strength ma et al 2012 as illustrated in fig s6 the cao2 feso4 treatment could increase the zeta potential from 21 2 to 14 2 mv also indicating that the algal cells were more prone to agglomeration in conclusion the combination of cao2 and feso4 could agglomerate the algal cells and organics hence forming larger flocs compared with the dense cake layer formed in the filtration of raw water the fouling layer accumulated by flocs was sparser and more porous and the algal cells deposited on the surface was distinctly reduced liu et al 2018 with the pretreatment of cao2 feso4 the pollutants accumulated on the membrane could be reduced in this case the transformation of membrane fouling mechanism from pore blockage to cake filtration was delayed causing the increase of membrane flux and the mitigation of membrane fouling 4 conclusion in this work a novel cao2 feso4 strategy was proposed to enhance the uf performance for algae laden water purification and the following conclusions could be drawn 1 the synergistic effect of cao2 and feso4 could improve the feed and permeate water quality through enhancing the reduction of algal cells and organic pollutants the results of fluorescence spectra and molecular weight distributions indicated that macromolecular protein like substances were decomposed resulting in the generation of micromolecular humic like matters moreover the agglomeration of algal foulants was also promoted 2 the cao2 feso4 strategy showed surpassing effect in increasing permeate flux and alleviating fouling under the optimum conditions the final specific fluxes were improved by 75 0 and 56 5 and the total fouling resistances were reduced by 97 9 and 95 5 for pes and pvdf membranes respectively furthermore the transformation of fouling mechanism to cake filtration was significantly delayed 3 it can be verified from ftir spectroscopy and surface morphologies that cao2 feso4 pretreatment could alleviate the fouling of membrane by reducing the accumulation of algal pollutants on the membrane 4 in the synergistic process of cao2 and feso4 fe2 could activate h2o2 to generate oh thus enhancing the oxidative degradation of algal organics simultaneously fe2 could be oxidized by h2o2 thus forming fe3 to promote the agglomeration of algal cells in addition the generated ca oh 2 precipitates could also improve the coagulation effect of algal pollutants

16324,advanced oxidation processes aops have been widely investigated for the treatment of recalcitrant organic pollutants here we report the first study on the performance evaluation in different environmental matrices of a newly developed aop plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation with silver doped spinel ferrite 0 5wt ag mnfe2o4 as the catalyst for the degradation of representative micropollutants e g atrazine and atenolol the real matrices include surface water sw ph 6 82 secondary effluent se ph 7 22 and reverse osmosis ro concentrate roc ph 7 90 generated during water reuse a kinetic model combining the rct concept the ratio of the total oh exposure to the total o3 exposure and expressions of transient steady state hydroxyl radical oh concentrations has been successfully developed to predict the treatment performance where the effects of major influencing factors e g solution chemistry such as ph and water constituents and operating conditions were explicitly

model byproduct energy consumption 1 introduction advanced oxidation processes aops have been intensively investigated for the removal of synthetic organic compounds e g micropollutants mps aops usually involve in situ generation of strong oxidants e g hydroxyl radicals oh and sulfate radicals so4 at sufficient amounts to achieve organics oxidation or even mineralization buxton et al 1988 glaze et al 1987 while contaminants can be permanently destroyed instead of being merely transferred to a brine or other phases for further treatment disposal aops are usually energy intensive and may generate undesired byproducts bergmann et al 2014 fatta kassinos et al 2011 hodges et al 2018 in an effort to address these challenges our research group have developed a novel heterogeneous catalytic ozonation process utilizing the localized surface plasmon resonance lspr of plasmonic nanoparticles doped on the spinel ferrite substrate e g ag mnfe2o4 to achieve accelerated ozone decomposition and subsequent generation of reactive species for the degradation of recalcitrant pollutants and 35 fold and 7 fold increases in the degradation rates were achieved with a very low photon input 10 10 einstein l 1 s 1 at the plasmon band of ag 470 nm as compared to ozonation alone and catalytic ozonation i e with catalysts but without light irradiation respectively yang et al 2021 the high efficiency of pollutant abatement was also demonstrated in tap water under realistic water treatment conditions with low bromate formation 7 μg l yang et al 2021 in spite of the promising performance of plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation further evaluation in environmental matrices particularly the more challenging ones e g secondary effluent and reverse osmosis ro concentrate is needed as the solution chemistry is known to have profound effects on the treatment efficiency jiang et al 2013 kasprzyk hordern et al 2003 petrie et al 2014 investigation and interpretation of such effects preferably in a quantitative approach can not only deepen our understanding of this novel treatment process but also provide useful information and guidelines for practical applications ozone has long been used in water treatment in order to provide quantitative information of the major oxidants in ozonation systems the rct concept eq 1 was introduced to represent the ratio of the total oh exposure to the total o3 exposure elovitz and von gunten 1999 eq 1 r ct oh dt o 3 dt both o3 and oh can contribute to the degradation of the target micropollutant mp as shown in eqs 2 3 eq 2 d m p d t k o 3 m p o 3 m p k o h m p o h m p eq 3 l n m p 0 m p t k o 3 m p o 3 d t k o h m p o h d t k o 3 m p k o h m p r c t o 3 d t furthermore environmental matrices are complicated and different species may play various roles such as initiators promoters and inhibitors in the generation propagation inhibition and or termination of oh for example some inorganic species e g hco3 co3 2 and po4 3 can inhibit degradation of the target compounds by acting as radical scavengers and or competing for the reactive sites on catalysts staehelin and hoigne 1985 wang et al 2018a yong and lin 2012 moreover the bulk organics in different environmental waters e g natural organic matters nom and effluent organic matters efom which usually exist in much higher concentrations than that of the target pollutant can also competitively consume ozone and or the reactive species generated upon ozone decomposition thus negatively influencing the treatment performance jiang et al 2013 petrie et al 2014 rivera utrilla et al 2013 to this end an expression of the transient steady state oh concentration has been developed staehelin and hoigne 1985 eq 4 o h s s 2 k 1 o h k i i m i i k s i m s i o 3 where k1 represents the rate constant of oh with o3 k i i and k s i represent the rate constants of initiator mi i and inhibitor ms i with oh respectively and mi i and ms i represent the concentrations of initiators and inhibitors respectively hence by combining the rct concept and the expression of transient steady state oh concentration it is possible to investigate and evaluate the respective effects of different influencing factors e g chemical species or operating conditions that are applicable to the specific system of interest on the degradation of the target pollutant yong and lin 2012 the main objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation for the abatement of representative micropollutants in different environmental matrices i e surface water sw secondary effluent se and ro concentrate roc generated during water reuse ag mnfe2o4 with stable mineralogical structures and great plasmon responsive catalytic reactivity was used as the catalyst and monochromatic light emitting diode led at the ag plasmon band 470 nm was employed as the light source atrazine atz and atenolol atl both of environmental significance esplugas et al 2007 petrie et al 2014 and with low to medium reactivity with ozone ko3 atz 6 0 m 1 s 1 k oh atz 3 109 m 1 s 1 acero et al 2000 ko3 atl 1 7 103 m 1 s 1 k oh atl 8 109 m 1 s 1 márquez et al 2014 wu et al 2019 were selected as the model compounds here we first examined atz removal during plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation in different matrices and further identified the major chemical species that influenced the overall performance in the following study we quantitatively evaluated these effects and developed a semi empirical kinetic model utilizing the rct concept and expressions of oh ss which explicitly incorporated the major influencing operating and water chemistry parameters the validity of the model was then examined by comparing the time dependent degradation of atl predicted by the model with that measured experimentally under different operating and solution chemical conditions bromate formation was also monitored during the runs lastly the electrical energy per order eeo was estimated for the treatment of different environmental matrices research results of this study can provide first hand quantitative information on the applicability and guidelines of plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation for practical applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents iron nitrate nonahydrate fe no3 3 9h2o acros organic silver nitrate agno3 alfa aesar and manganese

samples of environmental matrices were stored at 4 c until use the main matrix characteristics are summarized in table s1 it is noted that the se sample collected in this study was of low strength i e low organic content 2 3 catalyst synthesis and ozonation experiments catalysts 0 5wt ag mnfe2o4 were synthesized via a facile one pot auto combustion method followed by h2 reduction as detailed in our previous study yang et al 2021 and in the supporting information si text s1 plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation experiments were conducted in a semi batch reactor where ozone feed gas was continuously bubbled into a 250 ml cylindrical quartz reactor yang and wu 2019 pure oxygen o2 was used as the feeding gas for ozone o3 generation by an ozone generator mp5000 a2z ozone inc usa ozone gas was injected at the bottom of reactor with a diffuser stone quartzes porous plate at a flow rate of 0 1 l min at working temperature and pressure the concentration of feeding o3 as well as that in the offgas line was continuously monitored using two ozone analyzers api 454 hence the transferred ozone dose tod mg l during the experiment can be calculated from eq 5 eq 5 t o d 0 t q g a s v o 3 i n l e t o 3 o u t l e t d t where o3 inlet and o3 outlet are ozone concentrations in the feeding line and off gas line respectively mg l qgas is gas flow into the reactor 0 1 l min v is the volume of the working solution l t is the treatment time min for a typical run 0 20 g solid catalysts were added into 150 ml working solution spiked with the desired amount of model compounds two led lights λ 470 nm were used as the light source and photon flux dosed into the reactor during the run was determined using chemical actinometry yang et al 2021 ph was monitored but not adjusted during the run samples were taken at pre determined time intervals and quenched by na2s2o3 to dissipate the residual ozone and then filtered through an ozone resistant filter millipore pvdf 0 45 μm to separate the catalyst preliminary tests confirmed that na2s2o3 quenching and filtration did not affect analytical measurement of the target compounds control experiments of catalytic ozonation and ozonation were conducted under the same conditions without catalysts and or light irradiation all experiments were conducted at least in duplicates and the error bars in the figures represent the standard deviations 2 4 analytical methods low concentrations of atrazine atz and atenolol atl 0 03 mg l were measured using hplc ms ms dionex ultimate 3000 ltq orbitrap xl in positive electrospray ionization esi mode text s2 higher concentrations of atrazine and atenolol were determined using high performance liquid chromatography hplc dad agilent 1100 series with a reversed phase luna c 18 analytic column aglient

characteristics the catalysts 0 5wt ag mnfe2o4 used in this study have been fully characterized by x ray diffraction xrd high resolution transmission electron microscopy hr tem x ray absorption spectroscopy xas measurements including x ray absorption near edge structure xanes and extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps in our previous study yang et al 2021 briefly xrd patterns of the catalyst matched the standard jcpds card no 10 0319 for the magnetic mnfe2o4 spinel and ag doping did not change the spinel structure linear combination fitting lcf of ag k edge xanes spectra indicated ag0 and ag accounted for 22 and 78 of ag in the bulk catalyst respectively a general formula mn0 22 fe0 78 a mn0 78fe1 22 bo4 was derived based on extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs fitting where a and b represent the tetrahedral and octahedral sites respectively xps analyses showed ag 0 and 1 fe 2 and 3 and mn 2 and 3 were present on the catalyst surface in this study fourier transformed infrared atr ftir spectra were also employed to study the surface acidic properties of catalysts with different ag doping using pyridine as a probe molecular figure s1 text s3 the results showed that 0 5wt ag mnfe2o4 catalyst may have more lewis acidic sites than 0 25wt ag mnfe2o4 and 1wt ag mnfe2o4 which agrees well with our previous study yang et al 2021 the scanning transmission electron microscopy stem images of the catalysts are shown in figure s2 3 2 performance of plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation in environmental matrices performance of plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation for the removal of the model compound atz was first examined in different environmental matrices including surface water sw secondary effluent se and ro concentrate roc produced as described in section 2 2 experiments of ozonation alone and catalytic ozonation i e without light irradiation were also conducted under otherwise same conditions for comparison as shown in fig 1 a c in all three matrices atz degradation generally followed a global first order kinetics where the fastest removal was achieved in plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation followed by catalytic ozonation and then ozonation at the same transferred ozone dose eq 5 these results confirmed the superior performance of plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation even in dom rich environmental matrices moreover although the mass ratio of transferred ozone to doc was kept constant i e 0 85 in different matrices the rate of atz degradation followed the order katz 0 397 min 1 sw katz 0 189 min 1 se katz 0 116 min 1 roc in plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation processes clearly demonstrating the matrix effects fig 1d since atz has a very low reactivity with o3 its degradation during plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation was mainly contributed to the reactive species generated upon ozone decomposition e g oh o2 and 1o2 yang et al 2021 it is well known that presence of various organic and inorganic species can influence ozone decomposition in water which may act as either initiators e g oh reacting directly with o3 for the generation of o2 or o3 and subsequent oh formation or inhibitors terminating the chain reactions after reacting with oh e g hco3 co3 2 and po4 3 staehelin and hoigne 1985 yong and lin 2012 furthermore usually dissociative adsorption of ozone on the active sites is an important step during heterogeneous catalytic ozonation for the generation of various reactive species for example we think the accelerated ozone decomposition during plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation with ag mnfe2o4 as the catalysts was achieved through energy transferred from plasmonic ag nanostructures to ozone adsorptive sites e g surface oh groups during lspr decay at both existing and newly activated catalytic active sites yang et al 2021 hence interactions between different species present in the water matrices and the catalyst active sites can also affect likely negatively ozone decomposition through the dissociative adsorption pathway environmental waters are complicated matrices where both bulk organics e g natural organic matters nom in sw and effluent organic matters efom in se and various inorganic species along with the target pollutants co exist these substances may initiate or inhibit ozone decomposition scavenge the radical species or occupy block surface active sites for ozone adsorption for example phosphate has often been employed as a strong lewis base to probe the role of surface oh groups as active sites for ozone decomposition in heterogeneous catalytic ozonation sun et al 2014 wang et al 2018b zhao et al 2013 in an effort to elucidate the effects of specific chemical species commonly present in environmental waters on the abatement of target pollutants in plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation processes we first evaluated the removal of atz in deionized di water as well as synthetic matrices which simulated the major inorganic contents in the environmental samples but without organic matters s sw s se and s roc table s1 as shown in fig 2 while 95 was degraded in the di matrix in 5 min atz removal was lower in synthetic solutions i e 90 in synthetic sw 73 in synthetic se and 58 in synthetic roc confirming the influence of inorganic species on the other hand better performance in these synthetic solutions than that in the corresponding real environmental matrices also demonstrated the effects of organic matters further upon a closer look it can be seen that difference between the synthetic and real water samples was less pronounced than that between di and synthetic solutions especially for se and roc indicating the important role of inorganic species particularly at relatively high concentrations to further identify the main inorganic species that inhibit the degradation of the target pollutant we examined atz degradation during plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation in the presence of several common inorganic anions including phosphate carbonate bicarbonate alkalinity sulfate chloride and nitrate within the typical concentration range in environmental waters as shown in fig 3 while choride sulfate and nitrate had minimum effects phosphate and carbonate biocarbonate clearly inhibited atz removal likely due to scavenging of reactive species and or competitive occupancy of the ozone adsorption sites on the catalysts 3 3 development of kinetic models for the degradation of target pollutants in plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation processes utilizing the rct concept and oh ss results and discussion of section 3 2 have laid a good groundwork for developing kinetic models for the removal of target pollutants in environmental matrices based on eqs 1 4 this approach was selected because the effects of major influencing factors e g solution chemistry and operating parameters are explicitly expressed in a quantitative way which may be particularly appealing for practical applications because prediction of the treatment performance under different conditions becomes possible in plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation processes hydroxyl ions oh nom efom and catalyst light irradiation contribute to the total initiation capacity while the total inhibition capacity can be taken as the additive effects of nom efom hco3 co3 2 and po4 3 it should be noted that nom efom can simultaneously act as the initiator promoter and inhibitor in ozonation processes staehelin and hoigne 1985 although they do not affect the rct value promoters can propagate the radical chain reactions yong and lin 2012 moreover we have confirmed the validity of surface oh density to represent the ozone adsorption capacity in our previous study with the same experimental setup and have demonstrated the rate constants of ozone decomposition as well as those of the model compound degradation changed proportionally to the photon flux in the plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation process yang et al 2021 therefore eq 4 can be rewritten as the following equation eq 6 oh s s 2 k 1 o h k 2 o 3 a d s m a x k i 1 1 k i 1 o 3 a ρ c a t a l y s t k i 2 t o c k s 2 t o c k 3 h c o 3 k 4 p o 4 3 o 3 where k1 represents the rate constant of oh with o3 m 1 s 1 k2 is the rate constant of catalyst m 1 s 1 ki1 is the constant of adsorption equilibrium of langmuir hinshelwood l h m 1 o3 a is the steady state dissolved ozone concentration m o3 ads max is the maximum coverage concentration of the adsorbed ozone m ρ is the density of surface oh groups mol g catalyst is the catalyst dose g l k i2 and k s2 represent the initiation and the inhibition rate constants of nom efom respectively m 1 s 1 toc represent the concentrations of nom efom as total organic carbon c m k 3 and k 4 represent the inhibition rate constants of hco3 co3 2 and po4 3 respectively m 1 s 1 and hco3 and po4 3 represent the concentrations of hco3 co3 2 and po4 3 respectively m furthermore as shown in text s4 a the coefficient of o3 in eq 4 equals to the numerical value of rct since rct can be experimentally determined by monitoring the degradation of a model compound using eq 3 the values of the different initiation and inhibition rate constants in the coefficient can also be determined in the following sections different sets of experiments were conducted to determine values of k1 k2 k i1 k i2 k s2 k 3 and k 4 with atz as the model pollutant 3 3 1 determination of initiation rate constants of oh k1 and ag doped mnfe2o4 catalysts k2 the reaction rate constant of oh with o3 k1 has been reported to be 70 m 1 s 1 and 160 m 1 s 1 staehelin and holgné 1982 yong and lin 2012 with the former being determined in the presence of 10 mm hco3 co3 2 and 50 mm po4 3 staehelin and holgné 1982 in this study we try to delineate each initiator inhibitor separately hence ozonation of atz in di matrices were first carried out in a semi batch reactor at different initial ph within the relative narrow range of environmental waters 6 8 8 where tert butanol tba k oh tba 5 0 108 m 1 s 1 was added as an external inhibitor under these conditions eq 6 can be simplified as eq 7 oh s s 2 k 1 o h k o h t b a t b a o 3 as expected higher ph led to faster atz degradation figure s3a moreover as can be seen in figure s3b ph remained relatively constant during the runs therefore oh may be approximated using the initial ph rct values at different ph can be computed based on experimental data of atz degradation using eq 3 figure s4a k1 can then be determined from the slope of the plot of rct vs oh which is found to be 144 6 m 1 s 1 here figure s4b this value is close to the reported value of 160 m 1 s 1 and is used in the following studies it is worth emphasizing that plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation is a highly complex system involving three phases as well as light irradiation while our previous research effort was devoted to understand the underlying mechanisms of plasmon induced enhancement the objectives of this study were to evaluate the process performance in real environmental matrices and further to develop a semi empirical model with major operating parameters and influencing chemical species as the input for convenient practical applications therefore in order to quantitatively evaluate the contribution of catalysts light irradiation to ozone decomposition a mass balance approach was employed several sets of semi batch ozone decomposition experiments were conducted in the presence of catalysts with light irradiation in di matrices to eliminate effects of other chemical species the initial ph was set at 7 00 and the variation was within 0 20 during the runs under these conditions a mass balance analysis of ozone at steady state yields eq 8 q g a s o 3 i n l e t o 3 o u t l e t r v where r is the overall ozone decomposition rate and other parameters are defined in eq 5 here ozone may be decomposed via both homogeneous pathways r1 k1 oh o3 a and heterogeneous pathways r2 k 2 oh surface o3 a k 2 o 3 a d s m a x k i 1 1 k i 1 o 3 a oh surface o3 a text s4 however under the experimental conditions here homogeneous ozone decomposition may be neglected as the rate was very low r1 10 5 m s 1 r 3 6 10 3 m s 1 hence eq 8 can be rewritten as eq 9 q g a s o 3 i n l e t o 3 o u t l e t v k 2 o 3 a d s m a x k i 1 1 k i 1 o 3 a oh s u r f a c e o 3 a by varying the feed gas concentration a linear relationship of 1 r2 vs 1 o3 a was obtained and the rate constant k2 and the constant of adsorption equilibrium constant of l h ki1 under certain photon flux were determined from the slope and the intercept of the plots figure s5a eqs s7 text s4 b to further investigate the effects of photon inputs on k2 plots of 1 r2 vs 1 o3 a were also obtained at different photon flux 3 1 10 10 einstein l 1 s 1 6 4 10 10 einstein l 1 s 1 a linear correlation between k2 and photon flux was revealed which can be used to determine k2 under different light irradiation conditions figure s5b it should be noted the adsorption equilibrium of l h ki1 remains relatively constant 1 37 105 m 1 with different photon fluxes based on the results and discussion above the contribution of catalysts light irradiation to ozone decomposition can be conveniently determined under different operating conditions such as photon input i e determine k2 in eq 6 or catalyst dose i e catalyst in eq 6 3 3 2 determination of inhibition rate constants of carbonate bicarbonate k3 and phosphate k4 to quantify the inhibition effects of hco3 co3 2 and po4 3 experiments of atz degradation during plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation processes were carried out in the presence of hco3 co3 2 or po4 3 at different concentrations with the addition of tert butanol as an external inhibitor thus eq 6 becomes eq 10 oh s s 2 k 1 o h k 2 o 3 a d s max k i 1 1 k i 1 o 3 a ρ c a t a l y s t k 3 h c o 3 k o h t b a t b a o 3 eq 11 oh s s 2 k 1 o h k 2 o 3 a d s max k i 1 1 k i 1 o 3 a ρ c a t a l y s t k 4 p o 4 3 k o h t b a t b a o 3 as shown in figure s6 the removal of atz decreased as the concentrations of hco3 co3 2 and po4 3 increased which was completely inhibited at an initial concentration of 400 mg l of hco3 co3 2 as caco3 and 100 mg l of po4 3 the rct values determined at different initial hco3 co3 2 0 200 mg l as caco3 and po4 3 0 15 mg l concentrations are shown in figure s7a and s7c respectively further k 3 and k 4 were determined from the slope of the plot 1 rct vs hco3 co3 2 or po4 3 figures s7b s7d eqs s8 s9 text s4 c which were found to be 8 31 106 m 1 s 1 and 5 92 105 m 1 s 1 respectively the rate constant of hco3 co3 2 with oh determined in this study was close to the reported value 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 obtained in aqueous solutions yong and lin 2012 this indicates that the inhibitive effects on atz degradation exerted by hco3 co3 2 can mainly be ascribed to the homogeneous pathways such as scavenging of oh on the other hand the inhibition rate constant of po4 3 determined here is approximately 4 30 times as high as the reported values 0 2 1 5 105 m 1 s 1 obtained in aqueous solutions buxton et al 1988 implying that in addition to the oh scavenging effects interactions between phosphate anions and the catalysts such as ligand exchange with the surface hydroxyl group of catalyst qi et al 2013 2008 may play an even more important role here to this end we further examined the density of surface adsorbed ozone text s5 in the presence of catalysts with and without hco3 co3 2 or po4 3 as shown in fig s8 while the steady state density of surface adsorbed ozone remained relatively constant at different hco3 co3 2 the density of surface adsorbed ozone at steady state decreased with the increase of po4 3 concentration suggesting some adsorptive sites could have been taken up by po4 3 ions moreover slower ozone decomposition was observed in the presence of po4 3 compared with those in the presence of hco3 co3 2 or in the absence of both which further supports the discussion above 3 3 3 determination of initiation ki2 and inhibition ks2 rate constants of nom efom the composition concentration and chemistry of nom efom are highly variable and may differ from one water matrix to another during ozonation processes nom efom can affect the stability of o3 by involving in both the direct reaction with o3 and the indirect oxidation with oh and act as either initiators promoters or inhibitor jothinathan and hu 2018 staehelin and hoigne 1985 yong and lin 2013 2012 for example nom efom with some functional groups such as the electron rich aromatic moieties and aliphatic unsaturated constituents could be easily oxidized by o3 by electron transfer accompanied by the formation of intermediate radical species e g o3 and subsequent generation of oh and thus play a role of initiator promoter ji et al 2015 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 wang et al 2019 yong and lin 2012 on the other hand nom efom may act as the scavenger of radicals resulting in inhibitory effects moreover in heterogeneous processes nom efom may be adsorbed on the catalyst surface and occupy block the active sites ikhlaq et al 2015 luo et al 2015 because of the complex nature and consequently inevitable over simplification when represented with one model compound e g humic acid here we quantitatively evaluate the effects of nom efom in real environmental matrices in particular since roc used in this study was generated from se section 2 2 and thus the bulk organics should share the same characteristics but at a higher concentration experiments were conducted in sw and se with the addition of atz and an external inhibitor of tert butanol eq 6 becomes eq 12 when nom efom acting as both initiators and inhibitors is considered eq 12 oh s s 2 k 1 o h k 2 o 3 a d s m a x k i 1 1 k i 1 o 3 a ρ c a t a l y s t k i 2 t o c k o h t b a t b a k s 2 t o c k 3 h c o 3 k 4 p o 4 3 o 3 as all other parameters have been determined in previous sections the rate constants associated with nom efom can be obtained by the reciprocal of eq s10 text s4 d and from the slope and intercept of plots of 1 rct vs k oh tba tba figure s9 it should be emphasized that ki2 and ks2 are dependent on the specific characteristics of nom efom which may vary for different environmental matrices and should be used with caution in addition two stage ozone decomposition kinetics characterized by an initial high rct 20 s followed by a low rct stage have been reported for ozonation of nom containing water buffle et al 2006 yong and lin 2016 due to the limitation of the experimental setup here we were unable to collect enough data during the rapid stage nonetheless such two stage kinetics was not obvious in our experiments figure s9 possibly because of the accelerating effect of catalysts light irradiation on ozone decomposition up till now all the rate constants and parameters of eq 6 have been determined and are summarized in table 1 therefore the time dependent profile of the target pollutant concentration during treatment can be estimated using eq 3 where the rct value can be calculated using eq s4 3 4 model validation to validate the applicability and robustness of the kinetic model developed above we monitored the degradation of another model compound atenolol atl during plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation in different water matrices and under different operating and solution chemical conditions the experimental data was then compared with the model prediction as shown in fig 4 a c fig s10 a b and figure s11 a b eqs 3 s4 successfully predict atl removal in all three environmental matrices as well as under different operating conditions i e photon flux and catalyst dose we further examined atl removal against model predictions under different solution chemical conditions signifying the most important influencing chemical species in environmental waters as can be seen in fig 4 d f figure s10 c e and figure s11 c e a good agreement between the model prediction and experimental measurements was observed within the common concentration range of the selected species the coefficients of determination r2 were summarized in table s2 and a r2 0 95 was obtained for all runs except those at high phosphate concentrations 50 and 100 mg l in se and roc where the model tended to overestimate atl removal it is worth mentioning that phosphate has exhibited a significant inhibition effect at elevated concentrations therefore although applications in sw or se where phosphate is usually less than 20 mg l should be no issue vu and wu 2020 pre treatment for phosphate removal may be needed if the catalysts are used to treat matrices that contain high levels of phosphate while the model development and validation experiments discussed above were conducted at a relatively high atl concentration i e 2 mg l for the ease and accuracy of analytical analysis we also examined the treatment performance as well as the model prediction at an initial concentration of 10 μg l with a low ozone dose as shown in fig 5 a no atl was detected detection limit 0 05 μg l after 5 min o3 toc mass 0 7 10 min o3 toc mass 1 0 and 15 min o3 toc mass 1 1 treatment for sw se and roc respectively demonstrating the high treatment efficiency of plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation processes in various environmental matrices under realistic conditions in addition to the potential high energy consumption formation of harmful byproducts is another concern of aops in this study we also monitored the formation of bromate bro3 a characteristic ozonation byproduct during different treatment processes it has been reported that less bromate was generated in the presence of solid catalysts zhang et al 2011 2008 and even less formation of bromate occurred in the plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation process in our previous tests conducted in tap water yang et al 2021 similar trends were observed in sw se and roc here where 6 5 10 2 and 12 1 μg l bromate was detected in sw se and roc after 15 min treatment with plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation fig 6 moreover variations of concentrations of the main br containing species were recorded in different water matrices fig 5 b d results suggest that three major bromine containing species i e br hobr obr and bro3 are present mass balance analysis on total br content indicates minimum formation of bromated organic byproducts while investigation of bromate formation and inhibition mechanism of this novel catalytic ozonation process is out of the scope of this study and is part of our ongoing research it may be speculated that fast ozone decomposition and enhanced redox reactions on the catalyst surface are possibly responsible for the inhibition of bromate formation in the presence of catalysts and light irradiation nonetheless the high removal efficiency and low byproduct formation demonstrates the great potential of plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation processes for water wastewater treatment 3 5 estimation of energy consumption electrical energy per order eeo kwh m3 defined as the electrical energy required to degrade the contaminant by one order magnitude in m3 of treated water is a commonly used figure of merit to characterize the energy consumption of aops bolton et al 2001 eq 13 e e o p t 1000 v log c 0 c t where p is the electrical energy input into the reactor kw t is the treatment time h v is the working solution volume l c 0 and c t are the initial concentration and the final concentration of the target compound respectively mg l when degradation of the target contaminant can be described with first order kinetics with a reaction rate constant of k figure s12 eq 13 can be written as eq 14 e e o p 1000 v 0 4343 k for the plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation process both ozone generation eeo ozone kwh m3 and light irradiation eeo led kwh m3 involve energy consumption the electrical energy for ozone generation has been reported to be 15 kwh kg rosenfeldt et al 2006 usepa 1999 which together with ozone dose can be used to calculate eeo ozone eeo led can be estimated based on the photon flux and the plug efficiency of leds here we have estimated eeo of plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation processes under the treatment conditions of atl shown in fig 5a which is found to be 0 011 kwh m3 0 031 kwh m3 and 0 086 kwh m3 for sw se and roc respectively text s6 table s3 in addition eeo of different aops reported in the literature for the abatement of micropollutants in environmental matrices is also summarized in table s3 while it is difficult to direct compare the results of different studies due to the huge difference in experimental setup and conditions and characteristics of the model pollutants as well as the environmental matrices it can be seen that the energy consumption of plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation was much lower than most of other aops 4 conclusion this study evaluated the performance of a novel aop plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation process for the degradation of representative micropollutants in different environmental matrices including surface water sw secondary effluent se and ro concentrate roc a kinetic model combining the rct concept and expressions of steady state oh concentrations has been successfully developed to describe and predict the time dependent degradation profile of target pollutants under the influence of solution chemistry and operating conditions both bulk organic contents nom efom and some inorganic species commonly present in environmental waters i e hco3 co3 2 and po4 3 affected the treatment performance in particular while hco3 co3 2 mainly inhibits the target compound abatement via the homogeneous pathways such as scavenging of oh interactions between po4 3 and the catalysts such as ligand exchange with the surface hydroxyl group of the catalyst which serve as the reactive sites for adsorptive ozone decomposition play an important role in the inhibitive effects exerted by po4 3 tests under environmentally relevant and realistic treatment conditions demonstrated high treatment efficiencies

16324,advanced oxidation processes aops have been widely investigated for the treatment of recalcitrant organic pollutants here we report the first study on the performance evaluation in different environmental matrices of a newly developed aop plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation with silver doped spinel ferrite 0 5wt ag mnfe2o4 as the catalyst for the degradation of representative

model byproduct energy consumption 1 introduction advanced oxidation processes aops have been intensively investigated for the removal of synthetic organic compounds e g micropollutants mps aops usually involve in situ generation of strong oxidants e g hydroxyl radicals oh and sulfate radicals so4 at sufficient amounts to achieve organics oxidation or even mineralization buxton et al 1988 glaze et al 1987 while contaminants can be permanently destroyed instead of being merely transferred to a brine or other phases for further treatment disposal aops are usually energy intensive and may generate undesired byproducts bergmann et al 2014 fatta kassinos et al 2011 hodges et al 2018 in an effort to address these challenges our research group have developed a novel heterogeneous catalytic ozonation process utilizing the localized surface plasmon resonance lspr of plasmonic nanoparticles doped on the spinel ferrite substrate e g ag mnfe2o4 to achieve accelerated ozone decomposition and subsequent generation of reactive species for the degradation of recalcitrant pollutants and 35 fold and 7 fold increases in the degradation rates were achieved with a very low photon input 10 10 einstein l 1 s 1 at the plasmon band of ag 470 nm as compared to ozonation alone and catalytic ozonation i e with catalysts but without light irradiation respectively yang et al 2021 the high efficiency of pollutant abatement was also demonstrated in tap water under realistic water treatment conditions with low bromate formation 7 μg l yang et al 2021 in spite of the promising performance of plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation further evaluation in environmental matrices particularly the more challenging ones e g secondary effluent and reverse osmosis ro concentrate is needed as the solution chemistry is known to have profound effects on the treatment efficiency jiang et al 2013 kasprzyk hordern et al 2003 petrie et al 2014 investigation and interpretation of such effects preferably in a quantitative approach can not only deepen our understanding of this novel treatment process but also provide useful information and guidelines for practical applications ozone has long been used in water treatment in order to provide quantitative information of the major oxidants in ozonation systems the rct concept eq 1 was introduced to represent the ratio of the total oh exposure to the total o3 exposure elovitz and von gunten 1999 eq 1 r ct oh dt o 3 dt both o3 and oh can contribute to the degradation of the target micropollutant mp as shown in eqs 2 3 eq 2 d m p d t k o 3 m

various roles such as initiators promoters and inhibitors in the generation propagation inhibition and or termination of oh for example some inorganic species e g hco3 co3 2 and po4 3 can inhibit degradation of the target compounds by acting as radical scavengers and or competing for the reactive sites on catalysts staehelin and hoigne 1985 wang et al 2018a yong and lin 2012 moreover the bulk organics in different environmental waters e g natural organic matters nom and effluent organic matters efom which usually exist in much higher concentrations than that of the target pollutant can also competitively consume ozone and or the reactive species generated upon ozone decomposition thus negatively influencing the treatment performance jiang et al 2013 petrie et al 2014 rivera utrilla et al 2013 to this end an expression of the transient steady state oh concentration has been developed staehelin and hoigne 1985 eq 4 o h s s 2 k 1 o h k i i m i i k s i m s i o 3 where k1 represents the rate constant of oh with o3 k i i and k s i represent the rate constants of initiator mi i and inhibitor ms i with oh respectively and mi i and ms i represent the concentrations of initiators and inhibitors respectively hence by combining the rct concept and the expression of transient steady state oh concentration it is possible to investigate and evaluate the respective effects of different influencing factors e g chemical species or operating conditions that are applicable to the specific system of interest on the degradation of the target pollutant yong and lin 2012 the main objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation for the abatement of representative micropollutants in different environmental matrices i e surface water sw secondary effluent se and ro concentrate roc generated during water reuse ag mnfe2o4 with stable mineralogical structures and great plasmon responsive catalytic reactivity was used as the catalyst and monochromatic light emitting diode led at the ag plasmon band 470 nm was employed as the light source atrazine atz and atenolol atl both of environmental significance esplugas et al 2007 petrie et al 2014 and with low to medium reactivity with ozone ko3 atz 6 0 m 1 s 1 k oh atz 3 109 m 1 s 1 acero et al 2000 ko3 atl 1 7 103 m 1 s 1 k oh atl 8 109 m 1 s 1 márquez et al 2014 wu et al 2019 were selected as the model compounds here we first examined atz removal during plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation in different matrices and further identified the major chemical species that influenced the overall performance in the following study we quantitatively evaluated these effects and developed a semi empirical kinetic model utilizing the rct concept and expressions of oh ss which explicitly incorporated the major influencing operating and water chemistry parameters the validity of the model was then examined by comparing the time dependent degradation of atl predicted by the model with that measured experimentally under different operating and solution chemical conditions bromate formation was also monitored during the runs lastly the electrical energy per order eeo was estimated for the treatment of different environmental matrices research results of this study can provide first hand quantitative information on the applicability and guidelines of plasmon enhanced

samples of environmental matrices were stored at 4 c until use the main matrix characteristics are summarized in table s1 it is noted that the se sample collected in this study was of low strength i e low organic content 2 3 catalyst synthesis and ozonation experiments catalysts 0 5wt ag mnfe2o4 were synthesized via a facile one pot auto combustion method followed by h2 reduction as detailed in our previous study yang et al 2021 and in the supporting information si text s1 plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation experiments were conducted in a semi batch reactor where ozone feed gas was continuously bubbled into a 250 ml cylindrical quartz reactor yang and wu 2019 pure oxygen o2 was used as the feeding gas for ozone o3 generation by an ozone generator mp5000 a2z ozone inc usa ozone gas was injected at the bottom of reactor with a diffuser stone quartzes porous plate at a flow rate of 0 1 l min at working temperature and pressure the concentration of feeding o3 as well as that in

470 nm were used as the light source and photon flux dosed into the reactor during the run was determined using chemical actinometry yang et al 2021 ph was monitored but not adjusted during the run samples were taken at pre determined time intervals and quenched by na2s2o3 to dissipate the residual ozone and then filtered through an ozone resistant filter millipore pvdf 0 45 μm to separate the catalyst preliminary tests confirmed that na2s2o3 quenching and filtration did not affect analytical measurement of the target compounds control experiments of catalytic ozonation and ozonation were conducted under the same conditions without catalysts and or light irradiation all experiments were conducted at least in duplicates and the error bars in the figures represent the standard deviations 2 4 analytical methods low concentrations of atrazine atz and atenolol atl 0 03 mg l were measured using hplc ms ms dionex ultimate 3000 ltq orbitrap xl in positive electrospray ionization esi mode

characteristics the catalysts 0 5wt ag mnfe2o4 used in this study have been fully characterized by x ray diffraction xrd high resolution transmission electron microscopy hr tem x ray absorption spectroscopy xas measurements including x ray absorption near edge structure xanes and extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps in our previous study yang et al 2021 briefly xrd patterns of the catalyst matched the standard jcpds card no 10 0319 for the magnetic mnfe2o4 spinel and ag doping did not change the spinel structure linear combination fitting lcf of ag k edge xanes spectra indicated ag0 and ag accounted for 22 and 78 of ag in the bulk catalyst respectively a general formula mn0 22 fe0 78 a mn0 78fe1 22 bo4 was derived based on extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs fitting where a and b represent the tetrahedral and octahedral sites respectively xps analyses showed ag 0 and 1 fe 2 and 3 and mn 2 and 3 were present on the catalyst surface in this study fourier transformed infrared atr ftir spectra were also employed to study the surface acidic properties of catalysts with different ag doping using pyridine as a probe molecular figure s1 text s3 the results showed that 0 5wt ag mnfe2o4 catalyst may have more lewis acidic sites than 0 25wt ag mnfe2o4 and 1wt ag mnfe2o4 which agrees well with our previous study yang et al 2021 the scanning transmission electron microscopy stem images of the catalysts are shown in figure s2 3 2 performance of plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation in environmental matrices performance of plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation for the removal of the model compound atz was first examined in different environmental matrices including surface water sw secondary effluent se and ro concentrate roc produced as described in section 2 2 experiments of ozonation alone and catalytic ozonation i e without light irradiation were also conducted under otherwise same conditions for comparison as shown in fig 1 a c in all three matrices atz degradation generally followed a global first order kinetics where the fastest removal was achieved in plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation followed by catalytic ozonation and then ozonation at the same transferred ozone dose eq 5 these results confirmed the superior performance of plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation even in dom rich environmental matrices moreover although the mass ratio of transferred ozone to doc was kept constant i e 0 85 in different matrices the rate of atz degradation followed the order katz 0 397 min 1 sw katz 0 189 min 1 se katz 0 116 min 1 roc in plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation processes clearly demonstrating the matrix effects fig 1d since atz has a very low reactivity with o3 its degradation during plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation was mainly contributed to the reactive species generated upon ozone decomposition e g oh o2 and 1o2 yang et al 2021 it is well known that presence of various organic and inorganic species can influence ozone decomposition in water which may act as either initiators e g oh reacting directly with o3 for the generation of o2 or o3 and subsequent oh formation or inhibitors terminating the chain reactions after reacting with oh e g hco3 co3 2 and po4 3 staehelin and hoigne 1985 yong and lin 2012 furthermore usually dissociative adsorption of ozone on the active sites is an important step during heterogeneous catalytic ozonation for the generation of various reactive species for example we think the accelerated ozone decomposition during plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation with ag mnfe2o4 as the catalysts was achieved through energy transferred from plasmonic ag nanostructures to ozone adsorptive sites e g surface oh groups during lspr decay at both existing and newly activated catalytic active sites yang et al 2021 hence interactions between different species present in the water matrices and the catalyst active sites can also affect likely negatively ozone decomposition through the dissociative adsorption pathway environmental waters are complicated matrices where both bulk organics e g natural organic matters nom in sw and effluent organic matters efom in se and various inorganic species along with the target pollutants co exist these substances may initiate or inhibit ozone decomposition scavenge the radical species or occupy block surface active sites for ozone adsorption for example phosphate has often been employed as a strong lewis base to probe the role of surface oh groups as active sites for ozone decomposition in heterogeneous catalytic ozonation sun et al 2014 wang et al 2018b zhao et al 2013 in an effort to elucidate the effects of specific chemical species commonly present in environmental waters on the abatement of target pollutants in plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation processes we first evaluated the removal of atz in deionized di water as well as synthetic matrices which simulated the major inorganic contents in the environmental samples but without organic matters s sw s se and s roc table s1 as shown in fig 2 while 95 was degraded in the di matrix in 5 min atz removal was lower in synthetic solutions i e 90 in synthetic sw 73 in synthetic se and 58 in synthetic roc confirming the influence of inorganic species on the other hand better performance in these synthetic solutions than that in the corresponding real environmental matrices also demonstrated the effects of organic matters further upon a closer look it can be seen that difference between the synthetic and real water samples was less pronounced than that between di and synthetic solutions especially for se and roc indicating the important role of inorganic species particularly at relatively high concentrations to further identify the main inorganic species that inhibit the degradation of the target pollutant we examined atz degradation during plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation in the presence of several common inorganic anions including phosphate carbonate bicarbonate alkalinity sulfate chloride and nitrate within the typical concentration range in environmental waters as shown in fig 3 while choride sulfate and nitrate had minimum effects phosphate and carbonate biocarbonate clearly inhibited atz removal likely due to scavenging of reactive species and or competitive occupancy of the ozone adsorption sites on the catalysts 3 3 development of kinetic models for the degradation of target pollutants in plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation processes utilizing the rct concept and oh ss results and discussion of section 3 2 have laid a good groundwork for developing kinetic models for the removal of target pollutants in environmental matrices based on eqs 1 4 this approach was selected because the effects of major influencing factors e g solution chemistry and operating parameters are explicitly expressed in a quantitative way which may be particularly appealing for practical applications because prediction of the treatment performance under different conditions becomes possible in plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation processes hydroxyl ions oh nom efom and catalyst light irradiation contribute to the total initiation capacity while the total inhibition capacity can be taken as the additive effects of nom efom hco3 co3 2 and po4 3 it should be noted that nom efom can simultaneously act as the initiator promoter and inhibitor in ozonation processes staehelin and hoigne 1985 although they do not affect the rct value promoters can propagate the radical chain reactions yong and lin 2012 moreover we have confirmed the validity of surface oh density to represent the ozone adsorption capacity in our previous study with the same experimental setup and have demonstrated the rate constants of ozone decomposition as well as those of the model compound degradation changed proportionally to the photon flux in the plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation process yang et al 2021 therefore eq 4 can be rewritten as the following equation eq 6 oh s s 2 k 1 o h k 2 o 3 a d s m a x k i 1 1 k i 1 o 3 a ρ c a t a l y s t k i 2 t o c k s 2 t o c k 3 h c o 3 k 4 p o 4 3 o 3 where k1 represents the rate constant of oh with o3 m 1 s 1 k2 is the rate constant of catalyst m 1 s 1 ki1 is the constant of adsorption equilibrium of langmuir hinshelwood l h m 1 o3 a is the steady state dissolved ozone concentration m o3 ads max is the maximum coverage concentration of the adsorbed ozone m ρ is the density of surface oh groups mol g catalyst is the catalyst dose g l k i2 and k s2 represent the initiation and the inhibition rate constants of nom efom respectively m 1 s 1 toc represent the concentrations of nom efom as total organic carbon c m k 3 and k 4 represent the inhibition rate constants of hco3 co3 2 and po4 3 respectively m 1 s 1 and hco3 and po4 3 represent the concentrations of hco3 co3 2 and po4 3 respectively m furthermore as shown in text s4 a the coefficient of o3 in eq 4 equals to the numerical value of rct since rct can be experimentally determined by monitoring the degradation of a model compound using eq 3 the values of the different initiation and inhibition rate constants in the coefficient can also be determined in the following sections different sets of experiments were conducted to determine values of k1 k2 k i1 k i2 k s2 k 3 and k 4 with atz as the model pollutant 3 3 1 determination of initiation rate constants of oh k1 and ag doped mnfe2o4 catalysts k2 the reaction rate constant of oh with o3 k1 has been reported to be 70 m 1 s 1 and 160 m 1 s 1 staehelin and holgné 1982 yong and lin 2012 with the former being determined in the presence of 10 mm hco3 co3 2 and 50 mm po4 3 staehelin and holgné 1982 in this study we try to delineate each initiator inhibitor separately hence ozonation of atz in di matrices were first carried out in a semi batch reactor at different initial ph within the relative narrow range of environmental waters 6 8 8 where tert butanol tba k oh tba 5 0 108 m 1 s 1 was added as an external inhibitor under these conditions eq 6 can be simplified as eq 7 oh s s 2 k 1 o h k o h t b a t b a o 3 as expected higher ph led to faster atz degradation figure s3a moreover as can be seen in figure s3b ph remained relatively constant during the runs therefore oh may be approximated using the initial ph rct values at different ph can be computed based on experimental data of atz degradation using eq 3 figure s4a k1 can then be determined from the slope of the plot of rct vs oh which is found to be 144 6 m 1 s 1 here figure s4b this value is close to the reported value of 160 m 1 s 1 and is used in the following studies it is worth emphasizing that plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation is a highly complex system involving three phases as well as light irradiation while our previous research effort was devoted to understand the underlying mechanisms of plasmon induced enhancement the objectives of this study were to evaluate the process performance in real environmental matrices and further to develop a semi empirical model with major operating parameters and influencing chemical species as the input for convenient practical applications therefore in order to quantitatively evaluate the contribution of catalysts light irradiation to ozone decomposition a mass balance approach was employed several sets of semi batch ozone decomposition experiments were conducted in the presence of catalysts with light irradiation in di matrices to eliminate effects of other chemical species the initial ph was set at 7 00 and the variation was within 0 20 during the runs under these conditions a mass balance analysis of ozone at steady state yields eq 8 q g a s o 3 i n l e t o 3 o u t l e t r v where r is the overall ozone decomposition rate and other parameters are defined in eq 5 here ozone may be decomposed via both homogeneous pathways r1 k1 oh o3 a and heterogeneous pathways r2 k 2 oh surface o3 a k 2 o 3 a d s m a x k i 1 1 k i 1 o 3 a oh surface o3 a text s4 however under the experimental conditions here homogeneous ozone decomposition may be neglected as the rate was very low r1 10 5 m s 1 r 3 6 10 3 m s 1 hence eq 8 can be rewritten as eq 9 q g a s o 3 i n l e t o 3 o u t l e t v k 2 o 3 a d s m a x k i 1 1 k i 1 o 3 a oh s u r f a c e o 3 a by varying the feed gas concentration a linear relationship of 1 r2 vs 1 o3 a was obtained and the rate constant k2 and the constant of adsorption equilibrium constant of l h ki1 under certain photon flux were determined from the slope and the intercept of the plots figure s5a eqs s7 text s4 b to further investigate the effects of photon inputs on k2 plots of 1 r2 vs 1 o3 a were also obtained at different photon flux 3 1 10 10 einstein l 1 s 1 6 4 10 10 einstein l 1 s 1 a linear correlation between k2 and photon flux was revealed which can be used to determine k2 under different light irradiation conditions figure s5b it should be noted the adsorption equilibrium of l h ki1 remains relatively constant 1 37 105 m 1 with different photon fluxes based on the results and discussion above the contribution of catalysts light irradiation to ozone decomposition can be conveniently determined under different operating conditions such as photon input i e determine k2 in eq 6 or catalyst dose i e catalyst in eq 6 3 3 2 determination of inhibition rate constants of carbonate bicarbonate k3 and phosphate k4 to quantify the inhibition effects of hco3 co3 2 and po4 3 experiments of atz degradation during plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation processes were carried out in the presence of hco3 co3 2 or po4 3 at different concentrations with the addition of tert butanol as an external inhibitor thus eq 6 becomes eq 10 oh s s 2 k 1 o h k 2 o 3 a d s max k i 1 1 k i 1 o 3 a ρ c a t a l y s t k 3 h c o 3 k o h t b a t b a o 3 eq 11 oh s s 2 k 1 o h k 2 o 3 a d s max k i 1 1 k i 1 o 3 a ρ c a t a l y s t k 4 p o 4 3 k o h t b a t b a o 3 as shown in figure s6 the removal of atz decreased as the concentrations of hco3 co3 2 and po4 3 increased which was completely inhibited at an initial concentration of 400 mg l of hco3 co3 2 as caco3 and 100 mg l of po4 3 the rct values determined at different initial hco3 co3 2 0 200 mg l as caco3 and po4 3 0 15 mg l concentrations are shown in figure s7a and s7c respectively further k 3 and k 4 were determined from the slope of the plot 1 rct vs hco3 co3 2 or po4 3 figures s7b s7d eqs s8 s9 text s4 c which were found to be 8 31 106 m 1 s 1 and 5 92 105 m 1 s 1 respectively the rate constant of hco3 co3 2 with oh determined in this study was close to the reported value 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 obtained in aqueous solutions yong and lin 2012 this indicates that the inhibitive effects on atz degradation exerted by hco3 co3 2 can mainly be ascribed to the homogeneous pathways such as scavenging of oh on the other hand the inhibition rate constant of po4 3 determined here is approximately 4 30 times as high as the reported values 0 2 1 5 105 m 1 s 1 obtained in aqueous solutions buxton et al 1988 implying that in addition to the oh scavenging effects interactions between phosphate anions and the catalysts such as ligand exchange with the surface hydroxyl group of catalyst qi et al 2013 2008 may play an even more important role here to this end we further examined the density of surface adsorbed ozone text s5 in the presence of catalysts with and without hco3 co3 2 or po4 3 as shown in fig s8 while the steady state density of surface adsorbed ozone remained relatively constant at different hco3 co3 2 the density of surface adsorbed ozone at steady state decreased with the increase of po4 3 concentration suggesting some adsorptive sites could have been taken up by po4 3 ions moreover slower ozone decomposition was observed in the presence of po4 3 compared with those in the presence of hco3 co3 2 or in the absence of both which further supports the discussion above 3 3 3 determination of initiation ki2 and inhibition ks2 rate constants of nom efom the composition concentration and chemistry of nom efom are highly variable and may differ from one water matrix to another during ozonation processes nom efom can affect the stability of o3 by involving in both the direct reaction with o3 and the indirect oxidation with oh and act as either initiators promoters or inhibitor jothinathan and hu 2018 staehelin and hoigne 1985 yong and lin 2013 2012 for example nom efom with some functional groups such as the electron rich aromatic moieties and aliphatic unsaturated constituents could be easily oxidized by o3 by electron transfer accompanied by the formation of intermediate radical species e g o3 and subsequent generation of oh and thus play a role of initiator promoter ji et al 2015 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 wang et al 2019 yong and lin 2012 on the other hand nom efom may act as the scavenger of radicals resulting in inhibitory effects moreover in heterogeneous processes nom efom may be adsorbed on the catalyst surface and occupy block the active sites ikhlaq et al 2015 luo et al 2015 because of the complex nature and consequently inevitable over simplification when represented with one model compound e g humic acid here we quantitatively evaluate the effects of nom efom in real environmental matrices in particular since roc used in this study was generated from se section 2 2 and thus the bulk organics should share the same characteristics but at a higher concentration experiments were conducted in sw and se with the addition of atz and an external inhibitor of tert butanol eq 6 becomes eq 12 when nom efom acting as both initiators and inhibitors is considered eq 12 oh s s 2 k 1 o h k 2 o 3 a d s m a x k i 1 1 k i 1 o 3 a ρ c a t a l y s t k i 2 t o c k o h t b a t b a k s 2 t o c k 3 h c o 3 k 4 p o 4 3 o 3 as all other parameters have been determined in previous sections the rate constants associated with nom efom can be obtained by the reciprocal of eq s10 text s4 d and from the slope and intercept of plots of 1 rct vs k oh tba tba figure s9 it should be emphasized that ki2 and ks2 are dependent on the specific characteristics of nom efom which may vary for different environmental matrices and should be used with caution in addition two stage ozone decomposition kinetics characterized by an initial high rct 20 s followed by a low rct stage have been reported for ozonation of nom containing water buffle et al 2006 yong and lin 2016 due to the limitation of the experimental setup here we were unable to collect enough data during the rapid stage nonetheless such two stage kinetics was not obvious in our experiments figure s9 possibly because of the accelerating effect of catalysts light irradiation on ozone decomposition up till now all the rate constants and parameters of eq 6 have been determined and are summarized in table 1 therefore the time dependent profile of the target pollutant concentration during treatment can be estimated using eq 3 where the rct value can be calculated using eq s4 3 4 model validation to validate the applicability and robustness of the kinetic model developed above we monitored the degradation of another model compound atenolol atl during plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation in different water matrices and under different operating and solution chemical conditions the experimental data was then compared with the model prediction as shown in fig 4 a c fig s10 a b and figure s11 a b eqs 3 s4 successfully predict atl removal in all three environmental matrices as well as under different operating conditions i e photon flux and catalyst dose we further examined atl removal against model predictions under different solution chemical conditions signifying the most important influencing chemical species in environmental waters as can be seen in fig 4 d f figure s10 c e and figure s11 c e a good agreement between the model prediction and experimental measurements was observed within the common concentration range of the selected species the coefficients of determination r2 were summarized in table s2 and a r2 0 95 was obtained for all runs except those at high phosphate concentrations 50 and 100 mg l in se and roc where the model tended to overestimate atl removal it is worth mentioning that phosphate has exhibited a significant inhibition effect at elevated concentrations therefore although applications in sw or se where phosphate is usually less than 20 mg l should be no issue vu and wu 2020 pre treatment for phosphate removal may be needed if the catalysts are used to treat matrices that contain high levels of phosphate while the model development and validation experiments discussed above were conducted at a relatively high atl concentration i e 2 mg l for the ease and accuracy of analytical analysis we also examined the treatment performance as well as the model prediction at an initial concentration of 10 μg l with a low ozone dose as shown in fig 5 a no atl was detected detection limit 0 05 μg l after 5 min o3 toc mass 0 7 10 min o3 toc mass 1 0 and 15 min o3 toc mass 1 1 treatment for sw se and roc respectively demonstrating the high treatment efficiency of plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation processes in various environmental matrices under realistic conditions in addition to the potential high energy consumption formation of harmful byproducts is another concern of aops in this study we also monitored the formation of bromate bro3 a characteristic ozonation byproduct during different treatment processes it has been reported that less bromate was generated in the presence of solid catalysts zhang et al 2011 2008 and even less formation of bromate occurred in the plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation process in our previous tests conducted in tap water yang et al 2021 similar trends were observed in sw se and roc here where 6 5 10 2 and 12 1 μg l bromate was detected in sw se and roc after 15 min treatment with plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation fig 6 moreover variations of concentrations of the main br containing species were recorded in different water matrices fig 5 b d results suggest that three major bromine containing species i e br hobr obr and bro3 are present mass balance analysis on total br content indicates minimum formation of bromated organic byproducts while investigation of bromate formation and inhibition mechanism of this novel catalytic ozonation process is out of the scope of this study and is part of our ongoing research it may be speculated that fast ozone decomposition and enhanced redox reactions on the catalyst surface are possibly responsible for the inhibition of bromate formation in the presence of catalysts and light irradiation nonetheless the high removal efficiency and low byproduct formation demonstrates the great potential of plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation processes for water wastewater treatment 3 5 estimation of energy consumption electrical energy per order eeo kwh m3 defined as the electrical energy required to degrade the contaminant by one order magnitude in m3 of treated water is a commonly used figure of merit to characterize the energy consumption of aops bolton et al 2001 eq 13 e e o p t 1000 v log c 0 c t where p is the electrical energy input into the reactor kw t is the treatment time h v is the working solution volume l c 0 and c t are the initial concentration and the final concentration of the target compound respectively mg l when degradation of the target contaminant can be described with first order kinetics with a reaction rate constant of k figure s12 eq 13 can be written as eq 14 e e o p 1000 v 0 4343 k for the plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation process both ozone generation eeo ozone kwh m3 and light irradiation eeo led kwh m3 involve energy consumption the electrical energy for ozone generation has been reported to be 15 kwh kg rosenfeldt et al 2006 usepa 1999 which together with ozone dose can be used to calculate eeo ozone eeo led can be estimated based on the photon flux and the plug efficiency of leds here we have estimated eeo of plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation processes under the treatment conditions of atl shown in fig 5a which is found to be 0 011 kwh m3 0 031 kwh m3 and 0 086 kwh m3 for sw se and roc respectively text s6 table s3 in addition eeo of different aops reported in the literature for the abatement of micropollutants in environmental matrices is also summarized in table s3 while it is difficult to direct compare the results of different studies due to the huge difference in experimental setup and conditions and characteristics of the model pollutants as well as the environmental matrices it can be seen that the energy consumption of plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation was much lower than most of other aops 4 conclusion this study evaluated the performance of a novel aop plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation process for the degradation of representative micropollutants in different environmental matrices including surface water sw secondary effluent se and ro concentrate roc a kinetic model combining the rct concept and expressions of steady state oh concentrations has been successfully developed to describe and predict the time dependent degradation profile of target pollutants under the influence of solution chemistry and operating conditions both bulk organic contents nom efom and some inorganic species commonly present in environmental waters i e hco3 co3 2 and po4 3 affected the treatment performance in particular while hco3 co3 2 mainly inhibits the target compound abatement via the homogeneous pathways such as scavenging of oh interactions between po4 3 and the catalysts such as ligand exchange with the surface hydroxyl group of the catalyst which serve as the reactive sites for adsorptive ozone decomposition play an important role in the inhibitive effects exerted by po4 3 tests under environmentally relevant and realistic treatment conditions demonstrated high treatment efficiencies with low byproduct e g bromate formation 6 5 12 1 μg l and low energy consumption eeo 0 011 0 086 kwh m3 for different matrices underlining the great potential of plasmon enhanced catalytic ozonation
