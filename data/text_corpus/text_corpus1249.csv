6245,water quality is a sensitive topic of worldwide concern that is defined by a series of physical chemical and biological characteristics the complex nature for studying water quality requires finding simple models to identify the variables that influence it the most therefore the use of multivariate analysis techniques will be of immense help to find relationships and conclusions which aid us to determine the state of water quality through biological physical and chemical indicators in this investigation the following variables were evaluated temperature ph transparency turbidity nitrates orthophosphates phosphorus total nitrogen chlorophyll a solar radiation dissolved oxygen and microcystins these determined water quality at the sample sites gamboa and paraiso the results obtained through the application of a two way multivariate analysis method called hj biplot reflect variableś relationships of chemical physical and biological compositions furthermore results conform two clusters of sample points that satisfactorily match to the region seasons cluster 1 is characterized by the presence of the following variables ph transparency chlorophyll a oxygen and temperature on the other hand cluster 2 comprises the following variables nitrate orthophosphates turbidity and p total they are all parameters that suffer variations in the rainy season and that in turn can influence the presence of ciabobacteria with toxigenic potential furthermore this study demonstrates that the multivariate statistical methods are valuable for interpreting complex data sets specifically for water quality monitoring network keywords cluster hj biplot lakes multivariate statistical analysis water quality 1 introduction the deterioration of water quality is a matter of high concern due to reasons such as disproportional growth of human population expansion of industrial and agricultural activities or threats brought by climate change among others this could lead to important disturbances on the hydrological cycle that would imply serious reductions on water availability for any use rose et al 2016 the existing methodologies for studying and continuously monitoring water quality in lotic and lentic environments are largely based on physicochemical analysis hoellein et al 2013 the polluting products that enter the rivers are generally point source pollutants or they may be carried by runoff and be diluted consequently tools and technology that allow the early detection of specific alteration sites and that reflect the existing conditions before during and after the alteration of the medium are required cowan ellsberry et al 2014 sasi et al 2018 in this sense physicochemical methods provide immediate information of water condition wolska et al 2007 hydrochemical as well as hydrological and hydrodynamic behavior are intimately related especially in water systems like lakes lagoons and coastal water systems in general carmack et al 1986 sperotto et al 2017 2019 but also in rivers and streams riyaz ahmad mir et al 2016 nieto librero et al 2017 sperotto et al 2017 2019 there are several aspects provided by hj biplot approach that directly contribute to deepen the hydrochemical knowledge and consequently improve the hydrological and hydrodynamic understanding and interpretation of water systems some of those aspects are described as follows main hydrochemical and biological parameters can be characterized contextualized and classified thanks to hj biplot approach that makes much easier and straightforward the interpretation and quantification of the hydrological balance through its components such as rain evaporation discharge runoff and or leakage gonzalez cabrera et al 2006 nieto librero et al 2017 furthermore there is an evident knowledge generation provided by this approach regarding a clearer and deeper identification of relationships between the physicochemical and biological variables as well as the sampling points through different months gonzalez cabrera et al 2006 nieto librero et al 2017 since each period has its own peculiarities in regards to the hydrological components these temporal dynamics are very useful to improve the temporal hydrological system evolution also there is a clearer identification of the sources of pollution and the delimitation of the polluted zones gonzalez cabrera et al 2006 nieto librero et al 2017 this is directly related to the hydrodynamics and hydraulics of a water system and especially to the mixing mechanisms such as advection convection partition lixiviation volatilization dispersion diffusion absorption or degradation for contaminants sediments loadings or any other component all these previous mechanisms largely drive the processes of sedimentation and stratification of the layers lakes as well as wide rivers or estuaries and in general coastal water systems carmack et al 1986 the presence of suspended material clay silt organic colloids plankton and microscopic organisms cause water turbidity robert et al 2016 these particles of variable dimensions from 10 nm to 0 1 mm can be associated to three categories minerals humic organic particles and filamentous particles conductivity is produced by the electrolytes dissolved in the water and it is largely influenced by the drained land mineralogical composition contact time dissolved gases ph and everything that affects the solubility of salts the ph value of surface waters is 6 8 and groundwater is usually more acidic than surface water in lakes and reservoirs the ph varies cyclically decreasing as water depth increases chowdhury and al zahrani 2014 dhivya et al 2017 näykki et al 2014 sancho et al 2016 fluvial floods transport oxygen into the receiving deep layers of lakes and the oxygen is subject to cyclical variation related to the thermal behavior of lakes bronmark and hansson 2005 fink et al 2016 the association between chlorophyll a and total phosphorus tp is a fundamental limnological relationship that reflects multiple aspects of ecosystem function filstrup et al 2014 on the other hand temperature exerts great influence on biological activity and growth temperature also regulates the type of organisms that can live in the lake fish insects zooplankton phytoplankton and other aquatic species have a preferred temperature range bronmark and hansson 2005 furthermore nitrogen and phosphorus are the two most important elements for primary productivity in aquatic ecosystems these ions could be the most limiting factors on primary productivity phosphorus comes from the dissolution of phosphate rocks and from the mineralization of organic material which returns inorganic phosphorus to the medium through the process of microbial decomposition on the other hand the main source of nitrogen is atmospheric nitrogen nitrogen also returns to the medium through the decomposition of organic material grosse et al 2018 2014 kagami et al 2013 the microcystin toxin is produced by cyanobacteria these are bacteria or organisms that are microscopically small unicellular or colonial filamentous etc with some algae characteristics such as cellular wall structure pigments and the ability to perform oxygen photosynthesis the toxins produced by cyanobacteria have caused numerous animal poisonings worldwide and are one of the main focal points of the world health organization due to the number of cases of disease in humans the accelerated growth of toxic cyanobacteria has generated serious problems in the management of inland waters that are used for irrigation fishing and human supply gonzález piana et al 2017 mohamed et al 2015 moura et al 2018 for this research the measurement of ten quality variables was possible due to the availability of sophisticated instrumentation equipment for water quality measurement and analysis in the sampling sites gamboa and paraíso located in the gatún reservoir part of the panama canal watershed this permanent monitoring will also allow evaluating in the future the physicochemical and biological processes related to seasonal changes dry and rainy this will be useful for the evaluation of water quality in an aquatic environment to detect patterns of behavior in a group of data with different variables gül and gül 2016 koklu et al 2010 statistical methods are important in the analysis of water quality because a significant part of what is known about water quality comes from large sets of numerical data in many studies several statistical methods have been introduced for water quality data analysis fu and wang 2012 and to evaluate the diverse physicochemical and biological characteristics of the water béjaoui et al 2016 ferrer polonio et al 2017 oueslati et al 2015 statistical techniques such as factor analysis principal component analysis and discriminant analysis have widely been used as unbiased methods in analysis of water quality data bu et al 2014 guo et al 2018 kim et al 2017 singh and tripathi 2016 in a study carried by grupta et al 2009 the temporal spatial variations in water quality of mumbai coast were evaluated four factors were identified where the second factor turbidity and orthophospahtes represents natural pollution which includes the surface run off which is in line with these results studies investigating seasonal variability of water quality have reported that water quality issues such as eutrophication are highly dependent on the influences of watershed runoff zhang et al 2011 in line with the results from this study yang et al 2010 grouped the 12 months into two groups august september and the remainder using multivariate statistical methods to explain the spatial and temporal patterns of surface water pollution in lake dianchi furthermore the lake was divided into two regions based on their different physicochemical properties and pollution levels this work is mainly aimed to find the existing association between physicochemical and biological variables and to relate these sets to the months of the region s climatic season consequently multivariate statistical methods were used to achieve the better association between them conventional methods of analysis for the study of relationships between variables are usually correlation or multiple regression analyses kisi and parmar 2016 lloyd et al 2016 however water quality data usually exhibit the following characteristics non normal distribution presence of outliers and sometimes problems with data can generate confusion in the interpretation of analysis the analysis of clusters allows classifying the units according to similarities but it is not possible to know which combination of variables is the one that motivates the groupings that the corresponding dendrogram exhibits the factor analysis looks for a few latent variables that capture most of the information in the data but does not provide information on the similarity between the units under study for these reasons the technique chosen for this research is the hj biplot galindo 1986 which is an extension of the classical biplots introduced by gabriel 1971 biplot methods have been applied in numerous fields of science and technology because of this technique has alotfewer restrictions than conventional methods and the advantage of being a specific statistical tool for the inspection of data matrices hj biplot in particular has been applied in numerous studies in a variety of fields amor esteban et al 2018 díaz faes et al 2013 tejedor flores et al 2017 but it has not yet been applied to examine relation between variable in limnology studies in the present study the efficiency of multivariate statistical techniques hj biplot was applied to find the existing association between physicochemical and biological variables and to relate these sets to the months of the region s climatic season using hj biplot it is possible to interpret simultaneous the position the physicochemical biological variables represented by vectors and the sets represent by points and the relationships between them hj biplot consists of a graphic display of the rows and columns this method allows us to a identifying groupings of physical chemical variables with homogenous behavior patterns since the distance between points is associated in terms of similarity b through the angles formed by variables to check the relationships approximate the correlations among those in a such a way that acute angles are associated with variables that have high positive correlations obtuse angles are associated with variables that have high negative correlations and right angles are associated with no associated variables and 3 the order of the orthogonal projections of the sample points onto physical chemical variables approximates the order of the sample points in that physical chemical variable data were analyzed using the software developed by vicente villardón 2010 all the objectives of this study comprise the following ones to reveal the usefulness of the two way multivariate method hj biplot as a matrix inspection tool of physical chemical and biological data in a water body at a specific point and time to find the existing links between physicochemical and biological variables in bodies of water to find the sets of physicochemical and biological variables and to relate these sets to the months of the region s climatic season 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study overview panama canal watershed the panama canal watershed is one of the most important hydrological hydraulic systems in the republic of panama and in the world water quantity and quality largely depend on the condition of the forests and the natural habitat therefore its management requires knowledge about the natural water quality and the water dynamics through the hydrological cycle which define the characteristics that make it appropriate or not for its use panama canal authority 2010 gatun lake is the main reservoir for the operation of the panama canal it is considered the safe of the panama canal authority acp because it stores the amount of water needed for the operation of the panama canal and a significant portion of the population s water supply panama canal authority 2013 throughout the years results of the water quality index of gatun lake indicate that the water quality remains relatively stable at the different monitored sites good or excellent categories panama canal authority 2013 the water quality index wqi as a simplified approach of grouping certain parameters which are indicators of water quality deterioration is a way to communicate and evaluate the quality of water bodies however for the index to be practical the vast number of parameters must be reduced and simplified and during the simplification process some of the information is lost although there is an increase in potentially polluting activities the global results of the wqi suggest that the rivers that flow into the reservoir still have the capacity of assimilation and or dilution of pollutant load nevertheless it is observed that certain existing sites require more attention where the lower values of the wqi suggest that the impact of anthropogenic activities is a real and growing threat panama canal authority 2013 the hydrographic basin of the panama canal covers an area of 3313 km2 it is located within thedistrictofpanamá and colón whichis subdivided into 41 corregimientos the panama canal watershed is composed of many sub basins and three reservoirs within the canal structure complex alhajuela gatun and miraflores the climate of the basin is seasonal although any month from mid decemberto the beginning of may is fairly dry the annual range of precipitation goes from 2000 to 3500 mm from south to north the long term average annual precipitation in the barro colorado island located in gatun lake is 2600 mm and the average annual temperature is about 25 5 c fig 1 2 2 case study gatun lake data and sampling description the data used for the analysis correspond to measurements of physicochemical and biological parameters that determine the water quality at the sampling sites gamboa and paraiso located at gatun lake the data from 2009 was collected according to the protocols of the water quality unit of the panama canal authority three samples were collected at each site one meter from the surface samples were collected systematically every seven days until the first fourteen days of the month were completed from february to may and from july to december of 2009 measurements were taken in situ with a parametric probe ysi model 556 mps which had been previously verified and or calibrated at the laboratory appropriate containers were used for each sample glass polypropylene plastic etc collected samples were put in ice coolers and transported to the laboratory sampling sites were reached by land samples were collected to be analyzed at the laboratory of the water quality unit water division of the panama canal authority the analytical methods are described in the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha awwa wef 21 edition see table 1 a total of 12 water quality parameters was measured on site and at the laboratory which include temperature c ph transparency m turbidity ntu nitrates mg l orthophosphates mg l total phosphorus mg l total nitrogen mg l chlorophyll a μg l solar radiation langleys toxin microcystin μg l and dissolved oxygen mg l the samples for the toxin analysis microcystins were collected in amber glass containers and the analyses were carried out using the quanti tube method kit et039 from envirologix the solar radiation data was provided by the water resources section of the water division of the panama canal this data corresponds to the srfaa station located in balboa a total of 120 observations were obtained as a result of the three samples collected at each sampling site gamboa and paraiso twice a month on february feb march mar april apr may may july jul august aug september sep october oct november nov and december dec of 2009 each sample point is a sample that represents a month the number of times the collection is done during the month and the sampling site for example the sample point feb1p1 represents the month of february first sampling of the month at paraiso and the sample point feb2g2 represents the month of february second sampling of the month at gamboa gatun lake with a mean surface of 430 km2 forms a major part of the panama canal because of the existence of a large dam across the chagres river which was constructed between 1907 and 1913 it operates between water levels of 26 7 and 24 8 m abovesea level the gatún lake is the most important water reservoir for the canal operation it is located in the ancon corregimiento in panamá district iturralde amador and represa in la chorrera district and cristóbal limón nueva providencia cativa y sabanita corregimientos in colón district fig 2 2 3 methodology this methodology is articulated in three stages fig 3 first a descriptive analysis and hypothesis testing methodsof data was performed stage 1 after that the associations between the physicochemical and biological variables were searched and analyzed stage 2 lastly the physicochemical and biological variables that influenced the sets among the different sample points were identified stage 3 2 3 1 stage 1 basic statistical analysis for the analysis a matrix which contains 120 rows that represent the months and sampling points at the gamboa and paraiso locations and 12 columns physicochemical and biological variables was developed for this ten physicochemical and two biological variables have been considered the quantitative variables are described as mean standard deviation groups of comparisons were done using student s t 2 3 2 stage 2 hj biplot the main aim of the statistical analysis is to find the links between the physicochemical and biological variables for that the hj biplot technique which provides a graphic multivariate representation of rows and columns of a data matrix in a low dimensional subspace where their relative positions are interpretable was used the hj biplot representation technique allowed us to analyze all variables simultaneously biplot methodology is a statistical technique that consists of a graphic display of multivariate data the hj biplot galindo 1986 an extension of the classical biplots introduced by gabriel gabriel 1971 is an exploratory data analysis method that looks for hidden patterns in the data matrix hj biplot is a data representation technique consisting on visualizing a matrix of multivariate data x nxp using vectors as points called markers g 1 g 2 g n for each row and vectors called markers h 1 h 2 h p for each column each row represents a subject and each column a variable such that both markers sets can be superimposed onto the same reference system with the maximum quality of representation if the rows of a matrix a are described as markers g 1 g 2 g n and matrix b as markers h 1 h 2 h p it is obtained x a b t the markers are obtained from the usual singular value decomposition svd of the data matrix the singular value decomposition svd of matrix x is defined by x u d v t where u is the matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of x x t v is the matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of x t x and d is the matrix diagonal of singular values λ i of x let a and b be the matrices of the first two columns of ud and vd respectively for this paper the main goal of the hj biplot is to describe the relations between the row markers points of sampling and column markers physicochemical and biological variables regarding the interpretation rules of the hj biplot the proximity between individuals or row markers points of sampling is interpreted as a similarity the angles between two vectors joining two variables column markers with the origin are interpreted as a correlation and the proximity between a group of row markers and a column marker is defined in terms of preponderance summarizing two variables separated by a small angle are strongly correlated and a group of points of sampling next to a variable indicate that the individuals have taken preponderant values for this variable by projecting the points of sampling over the vectors that represent the physicochemical and biological variables it is possible to determine de approximate distribution that the points assume over these variables 2 3 3 stage 3 cluster analysis to identify the groupings the different points of sampling and the affected variables a cluster analysis has been conducted clustering is the process of grouping for identifying homogenous groups of individuals or objects the clusters were calculated through the biplot coordinates k means method euclidean distance the k means algorithm forgy 1965 macqueen 1967 is one of most used clustering algorithm in exploratory data analysis this method classifies a set of data into k number of disjoint clusters the algorithm for k means clustering is following as 1 to fix number of desired clusters 2 to initialize k centroids here a centroid is just the average of points of sampling in a cluster 3 the next step it takes each point of sampling to the cluster which has nearest centroid the euclidean distance is used to determine the distance between data points of sampling and the centroids 4 after all points of sampling have been assigned to clusters recalculate the centroids for each cluster 5 to repeat the points of sampling assignments and centroid calculations until no change in assignment occurs between iterations 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical and biological lake characterization the results referring to the physicochemical and biological variables are presented in table 2 this data suggests that during the analyzed period there are significant differences between gamboa and paraiso on the following variables ph p 0 01 transparency p 0 01 turbidity p 0 01 nitrates p 0 004 and toxin microcystin p 0 004 in general gamboa has less depth and more aquatic vegetation than paraiso this site receives a continuous flow of fresh water from the chilibre river and the middle section of the chagres river in paraiso there is little water transparency 2 0 m of depth this site is close to the navigation channel so that it is largely influenced by the transit of ships which suggests greater water turbulence as well as dredging activities that could favor an increase in suspended particles and as a result of this and increase in turbidity paraiso lake had the highest ph mean 7 27 turbidity mean 29 83 transparency mean 0 52 and nitrates mean 0 20 and lowest toxin mean0 12 turbidity was found to be in the range of 5 0 117 0 mean 29 83 in paraiso high values of turbidity have been reported in the others studies almeida et al 2012 brezonik et al 2005 high turbidity levels can reduce the amount of light reaching lower depths in bodies of water like lakes which inhibits growth of some forms of aquatic plants and can negatively affect species like furthermore ph is one of the most important factors in measuring water quality in the present study the range of the ph lies within 6 11 and 8 03 gupta et al 2017 and kumari et al 2013 reported comparative studies of physicochemical parameters of narmada river and found the range of ph is 7 4 8 8 in the month of april which is very much closer to the present study the physicochemical and biological variables that were analyzed are represented using vectors while the sampling areas can be identified through points their colors vary according to the month and sampling location gamboa y paraiso fig 4 shows the representation of the 1 2 factorial plane that resulted from the hj biplot which explains the 48 23 of the variance on the first axis the variables with the greatest variability were turbidity nitrates orthophosphates oxygen transparency and chlorophyll a this variability in transparency turbidity nitrates and orthophosphates could be explained by a stationary gradient related to the beginning of the rainy season and the nutrient contribution brought on by the runoff while the variability in chlorophyll a and oxygen may be associated to changes in temperature and wind as well as nutrient contribution which may affect the number of algae and at the same time the concentration of chlorophyll a this analysis showed that chlorophyll a water transparency and ph were strongly related and strongly negative correlations with nitrate turbidity and orthophosphates this is in good agreement with the conclusion made by cardille et al 2004 the study conducted by brezonik et al 2005 explored relationships between this variables for 15 minnesota lakes and they found turbidity and chlorophyll a had strongly positive correlations with one another and negative correlations with transparency however results from this study show a negative association of the turbidity and chlorophyll a carried out contrary to the results of this study these discrepancies are probably due to differences in sources of materials nutrients and suspended solids in line with the results from this research wu and kuo 2012 in a study in the feitsui reservoir watershed of taipei taiwan found association between the oxygen and chlorophyll a the second axis is determined by solar radiation and toxin which appear at the bottom part of the plane where the highest values of these variables are observed in september on the first sampling of the month in both zones gamboa and paraiso and october and november at the gamboa area on the second sampling in contrast to those months august and may in paraiso and gamboa on the second sampling are characterized mostly by higher temp temperature values both variables appear to have high correlation previous studies at the valmayor reservoir in spain showed that microcystin could photodegrade itself in surface systems reducing the quantity of toxins in the water wörmer et al 2010 it is important to highlight that the toxin is the most important variable to discriminate among the sampling points on axis 2 and that it is also an indicator with good variability in the study in contrast to these months august and may in paraíso and gamboa in the second sampling they are mainly characterized by higher temperature values this effect or seasonal variation of the temperature present in our study is also reflected in the study of the coast of mumbai grupta et al 2009 and likewise in the water quality investigation of the feitsui basin wu and kuo 2012 similarly there is some correlation between the nitrate turbidity and orthophosphate variables which show particularly high values on the months of september and october in both areas during the first and second sampling and on the first sampling in october in paraiso the inflow of nutrients varies through time depending on soil use and other factors during the summer the inflow of nutrients may increase due to the fertilization of crops whereas during winter heavy rains cause increased runoff of organic material such as leaves trunks vegetation and other organic remains that continue to decompose and as a result give rise to organic material and nutrients moreover no relationships were observed between turbidity and nitrates with solar radiation similarly the toxin has no relationship with orthophosphates 3 2 clustering according to sample points the cluster analysis was carried out based on the coordinates obtained from the hj biplot k means method cosine two clusters were formed with the different sample points on the graphic representation the clusters identified through the convex hulls lines fig 5 can be observed this analysis allowed us to identify the physicochemical and biological variables that influenced the sets among the different sample points table 3 shows the representation qualities for each conglomerate on plane 1 2 the clusters can be characterized as cluster 1 it is formed by the sample points in gamboa and paraiso on december february march april and may the variables present on this cluster are ph transparency chlorophyll a oxygen and temperature temp the months and variables associated in this cluster suggest possibilities regarding the physicochemical processes that occur at these sites of gatun lake during the dry season there was higher water transparency ph dissolved oxygen chlorophyll a and temperature but these parameters varied with respect to other months of the rainy season cluster 2 it is formed by the sample points taken mainly in may at paraiso in july august september october and november this cluster is formed the following variables nitrates orthophosphates turbidity and p total the link between months and variables suggests that when rainfall starts nutrients such as nitrates orthophosphates and total phosphorus are transported by suspended particles turbidity that are carried by runoff and then reach gamboa and paraiso the highest concentrations for each one of these variables are found during the rainy season and as a result of the increase in nutrients high sporadic values of chlorophyll a are found maximum value of 47 6 µg l during the rainy season this suggests that phytoplankton groups such as cyanobacteria could be gaining advantage over algae cyanobacteria have physiological mechanisms gas vacuoles which allow them to move along the water column and reach depths where nutrients are available where the temperature is optimal and where other conditions are favorable to them rigosi et al 2014 whereas algae green diatoms red etc are affected by turbidity because it blocks the light needed for photosynthesis gomes and juneau 2017 plantsneed nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus for growth but excessive concentrations can trigger algae blooms simth 2003 although the turbity in water could be caused by this association during the wet season so far this research comprises the only study on water quality in the panama canal watershed where the multivariate method of two hj biplot galindo 1986 routes was applied this has allowed to evaluate the physicochemical and biological processes related to seasonal changes dry and rainy in gamboa and paraíso sites in the gatún reservoir during the analyzed period this method also offers the advantage of allowing a representation of the sampling points rows and the physicochemical and biological variables columns simultaneously on the same coordinate system also this method provides a high representation quality both for the sampling points and for the physicochemical and biological variables however this method presents a limitation on the the data matrix original element xij representation although this limitation it is not an impediment for this method to be useful for the evaluation of water quality in an aquatic environment and to detect multivariate patterns in a complex group of data with different variables the grouping of the sampling months and the variables allow us to understand the complex nature of water quality issues in time and space and simultaneously interpret the behavior of the reservoir at a given time therefore these methods are useful for the evaluation of water quality in an aquatic environment and to detect multivariate patterns in a complex group of data with different variables 4 conclusions hydrochemical as well as hydrological and hydrodynamic behavior are intimately related especially in water systems like lakes lagoons and coastal water systems in general but also in rivers and streams there are several aspects provided by hj biplot approach that directly contribute to deepen the hydrochemical knowledge and consequently improve the hydrological and hydrodynamic understanding and interpretation of water systems these aspects may comprise the identification and quantification of hydrological budgets a clearer and deeper temporal dynamic identification of relationships between the physicochemical and biological variables as well as the sampling points through different months a better identification of the sources of pollution and the delimitation of the polluted zones improvement of hydrodynamics and hydraulics of water systems through a deeper understanding of mixing processes for contaminants sediments loadings or any other component all these previous mechanisms largely drive the processes of sedimentation and stratification of the layers lakes as well as wide rivers or estuaries and in general coastal water systems in this study a novel approach based on the development of hj biplot technique have allowed generating a new interpretation knowledge and evaluation about the water quality of gatun lake in this sense it facilitated the interpretation of the similarities dissimilarities between individuals sampling points the covariation between physicochemical and biological variables and even more important it determined which variables indicate the differences between the various sampling points the hj biplot has a descriptive character that has allowed seeing on a plane in a simple and clear manner the joint representation between the physicochemical and biological variables through the different months in both study areas hence this technique has allowed obtaining relationships between both physicochemical and biological variables as well as between the sampling points through different months the hj biplot proves to be an efficient tool for water quality studies in this case it showed that february and august in the second sample collection and october in the first one were the months that had the most influence in the water quality variability the results obtained in this study identify two well differentiated clusters according to the months of the season in the region to obtain a multivariate characterization one cluster comprised months and variables associated with the dry season it is a period of greater water transparency and high levels of the oxygen concentration ph values temperature measurements and chlorophyll a content the other cluster was composed of months and variables associated with wet season which is characterized by rains highnitrates orthophosphates and total phosphorus concentrations and sporadically high levels of chlorophyll a with values of up to 47 6 6 µg l this produces that phytoplankton groups like cyanobacteria could take advantage over algae based on the information obtained it is possible to better understand the complex issues of water quality and monitoring in the region in space and time furthermore this multivariate approach allowed a reliable classification of points of sampling from the study area as well as a better strategy for future monitoring finally this research and approach is expected to be useful for improving the knowledge on the general

6245,water quality is a sensitive topic of worldwide concern that is defined by a series of physical chemical and biological characteristics the complex nature for studying water quality requires finding simple models to identify the variables that influence it the most therefore the use of multivariate analysis techniques will be of immense help to find relationships and conclusions which aid us to determine the state of water quality through biological physical and chemical indicators in this investigation the following variables were evaluated temperature ph transparency turbidity nitrates orthophosphates phosphorus total nitrogen chlorophyll a solar radiation dissolved oxygen and microcystins these determined water quality at the sample sites gamboa and paraiso the results obtained through the application of a two way multivariate analysis method called hj biplot reflect variableś relationships of chemical physical and biological compositions furthermore results conform two clusters of sample points that satisfactorily match to the region seasons cluster 1 is characterized by the presence of the following variables ph transparency chlorophyll a oxygen and temperature on the other hand cluster 2 comprises the following variables nitrate orthophosphates turbidity and p total they are all parameters that suffer variations in the rainy season and that in turn can influence the presence of ciabobacteria with toxigenic potential furthermore this study demonstrates that the multivariate statistical methods are valuable for interpreting complex data sets specifically for water quality monitoring network keywords cluster hj biplot lakes multivariate statistical analysis water quality 1 introduction the deterioration of water quality is a matter of high concern due to reasons such as disproportional growth of human population expansion of industrial and agricultural activities or threats brought by climate change among others this could lead to important disturbances on the hydrological cycle that would imply serious reductions on water availability for any use rose et al 2016 the existing methodologies for studying and continuously monitoring water quality in lotic and lentic environments are largely based on physicochemical analysis hoellein et al 2013 the polluting products that enter the rivers are generally point source pollutants or they may be carried by runoff and be diluted consequently tools and technology that allow the early detection of specific alteration sites and that reflect the existing conditions before during and after the alteration of the medium are required cowan ellsberry et al 2014 sasi et al 2018 in this sense physicochemical methods provide immediate information of water condition wolska et al 2007 hydrochemical as well as hydrological and hydrodynamic behavior are intimately related especially in water systems like lakes lagoons and coastal water systems in general carmack et al 1986 sperotto et al 2017 2019 but also in rivers and streams riyaz ahmad mir et al 2016 nieto librero et al 2017 sperotto et al 2017 2019 there are several aspects provided by hj biplot approach that directly contribute to deepen the hydrochemical knowledge and consequently improve the hydrological and hydrodynamic understanding and interpretation of water systems some of those aspects are described as follows main hydrochemical and biological parameters can be characterized contextualized and classified thanks to hj biplot approach that makes much easier and straightforward the interpretation and quantification of the hydrological balance through its components such as rain evaporation discharge runoff and or leakage gonzalez cabrera et al 2006 nieto librero et al 2017 furthermore there is an evident knowledge generation provided by this approach regarding a clearer and deeper identification of relationships between the physicochemical and biological variables as well as the sampling points through different months gonzalez cabrera et al 2006 nieto librero et al 2017 since each period has its own peculiarities in regards to the hydrological components these temporal dynamics are very useful to improve the temporal hydrological system evolution also there is a clearer identification of the sources of pollution and the delimitation of the polluted zones gonzalez cabrera et al 2006 nieto librero et al 2017 this is directly related to the hydrodynamics and hydraulics of a water system and especially to the mixing mechanisms such as advection convection partition lixiviation volatilization dispersion diffusion absorption or degradation for contaminants sediments loadings or any other component all these previous mechanisms largely drive the processes of sedimentation and stratification of the layers lakes as well as wide rivers or estuaries and in general coastal water systems carmack et al 1986 the presence of suspended material clay silt organic colloids plankton and microscopic organisms cause water turbidity robert et al 2016 these particles of variable dimensions from 10 nm to 0 1 mm can be associated to three categories minerals humic organic particles and filamentous particles conductivity is produced by the electrolytes dissolved in the water and it is largely influenced by the drained land mineralogical composition contact time dissolved gases ph and everything that affects the solubility of salts the ph value of surface waters is 6 8 and groundwater is usually more acidic than surface water in lakes and reservoirs the ph varies cyclically decreasing as water depth increases chowdhury and al zahrani 2014 dhivya et al 2017 näykki et al 2014 sancho et al 2016 fluvial floods transport oxygen into the receiving deep layers of lakes and the oxygen is subject to cyclical variation related to the thermal behavior of lakes bronmark and hansson 2005 fink et al 2016 the association between chlorophyll a and total phosphorus tp is a fundamental limnological relationship that reflects multiple aspects of ecosystem function filstrup et al 2014 on the other hand temperature exerts great influence on biological activity and growth temperature also regulates the type of organisms that can live in the lake fish insects zooplankton phytoplankton and other aquatic species have a preferred temperature range bronmark and hansson 2005 furthermore nitrogen and phosphorus are the two most important elements for primary productivity in aquatic ecosystems these ions could be the most limiting factors on primary productivity phosphorus comes from the dissolution of phosphate rocks and from the mineralization of organic material which returns inorganic phosphorus to the medium through the process of microbial decomposition on the other hand the main source of nitrogen is atmospheric nitrogen nitrogen also returns to the medium through the decomposition of organic material grosse et al 2018 2014 kagami et al 2013 the microcystin toxin is produced by cyanobacteria these are bacteria or organisms that are microscopically small unicellular or colonial filamentous etc with some algae characteristics such as cellular wall structure pigments and the ability to perform oxygen photosynthesis the toxins produced by cyanobacteria have caused numerous animal poisonings worldwide and are one of the main focal points of the world health organization due to the number of cases of disease in humans the accelerated growth of toxic cyanobacteria has generated serious problems in the management of inland waters that are used for irrigation fishing and human supply gonzález piana et al 2017 mohamed et al 2015 moura et al 2018 for this research the measurement of ten quality variables was possible due to the availability of sophisticated instrumentation equipment for water quality measurement and analysis in the sampling sites gamboa and paraíso located in the gatún reservoir part of the panama canal watershed this permanent monitoring will also allow evaluating in the future the physicochemical and biological processes related to seasonal changes dry and rainy this will be useful for the evaluation of water quality in an aquatic environment to detect patterns of behavior in a group of data with different variables gül and gül 2016 koklu et al 2010 statistical methods are important in the analysis of water quality because a significant part of what is known about water quality comes from large sets of numerical data in many studies several statistical methods have been introduced for water quality data analysis fu and wang 2012 and to evaluate the diverse physicochemical and biological characteristics of the water béjaoui et al 2016 ferrer polonio et al 2017 oueslati et al 2015 statistical techniques such as factor analysis principal component analysis and discriminant analysis have widely been used as unbiased methods in analysis of water quality data bu et al 2014 guo et al 2018 kim et al 2017 singh and tripathi 2016 in a study carried by grupta et al 2009 the temporal spatial variations in water quality of mumbai coast were evaluated four factors were identified where the second factor turbidity and orthophospahtes represents natural pollution which includes the surface run off which is in line with these results studies investigating seasonal variability of water quality have reported that water quality issues such as eutrophication are highly dependent on the influences of watershed runoff zhang et al 2011 in line with the results from this study yang et al 2010 grouped the 12 months into two groups august september and the remainder using multivariate statistical methods to explain the spatial and temporal patterns of surface water pollution in lake dianchi furthermore the lake was divided into two regions based on their different physicochemical properties and pollution levels this work is mainly aimed to find the existing association between physicochemical and biological variables and to relate these sets to the months of the region s climatic season consequently multivariate statistical methods were used to achieve the better association between them conventional methods of analysis for the study of relationships between variables are usually correlation or multiple regression analyses kisi and parmar 2016 lloyd et al 2016 however water quality data usually exhibit the following characteristics non normal distribution presence of outliers and sometimes problems with data can generate confusion in the interpretation of analysis the analysis of clusters allows classifying the units according to similarities but it is not possible to know which combination of variables is the one that motivates the groupings that the corresponding dendrogram exhibits the factor analysis looks for a few latent variables that capture most of the information in the data but does not provide information on the similarity between the units under study for these reasons the technique chosen for this research is the hj biplot galindo 1986 which is an extension of the classical biplots introduced by gabriel 1971 biplot methods have been applied in numerous fields of science and technology because of this technique has alotfewer restrictions than conventional methods and the advantage of being a specific statistical tool for the inspection of data matrices hj biplot in particular has been applied in numerous studies in a variety of fields amor esteban et al 2018 díaz faes et al 2013 tejedor flores et al 2017 but it has not yet been applied to examine relation between variable in limnology studies in the present study the efficiency of multivariate statistical techniques hj biplot was applied to find the existing association between physicochemical and biological variables and to relate these sets to the months of the region s climatic season using hj biplot it is possible to interpret simultaneous the position the physicochemical biological variables represented by vectors and the sets represent by points and the relationships between them hj biplot consists of a graphic display of the rows and columns this method allows us to a identifying groupings of physical chemical variables with homogenous behavior patterns since the distance between points is associated in terms of similarity b through the angles formed by variables to check the relationships approximate the correlations among those in a such a way that acute angles are associated with variables that have high positive correlations obtuse angles are associated with variables that have high negative correlations and right angles are associated with no associated variables and 3 the order of the orthogonal projections of the sample points onto physical chemical variables approximates the order of the sample points in that physical chemical variable data were analyzed using the software developed by vicente villardón 2010 all the objectives of this study comprise the following ones to reveal the usefulness of the two way multivariate method hj biplot as a matrix inspection tool of physical chemical and biological data in a water body at a specific point and time to find the existing links between physicochemical and biological variables in bodies of water to find the sets of physicochemical and biological variables and to relate these sets to the months of the region s climatic season 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study overview panama canal watershed the panama canal watershed is one of the most important hydrological hydraulic systems in the republic of panama and in the world water quantity and quality largely depend on the condition of the forests and the natural habitat therefore its management requires knowledge about the natural water quality and the water dynamics through the hydrological cycle which define the characteristics that make it appropriate or not for its use panama canal authority 2010 gatun lake is the main reservoir for the operation of the panama canal it is considered the safe of the panama canal authority acp because it stores the amount of water needed for the operation of the panama canal and a significant portion of the population s water supply panama canal authority 2013 throughout the years results of the water quality index of gatun lake indicate that the water quality remains relatively stable at the different monitored sites good or excellent categories panama canal authority 2013 the water quality index wqi as a simplified approach of grouping certain parameters which are indicators of water quality deterioration is a way to communicate and evaluate the quality of water bodies however for the index to be practical the vast number of parameters must be reduced and simplified and during the simplification process some of the information is lost although there is an increase in potentially polluting activities the global results of the wqi suggest that the rivers that flow into the reservoir still have the capacity of assimilation and or dilution of pollutant load nevertheless it is observed that certain existing sites require more attention where the lower values of the wqi suggest that the impact of anthropogenic activities is a real and growing threat panama canal authority 2013 the hydrographic basin of the panama canal covers an area of 3313 km2 it is located within thedistrictofpanamá and colón whichis subdivided into 41 corregimientos the panama canal watershed is composed of many sub basins and three reservoirs within the canal structure complex alhajuela gatun and miraflores the climate of the basin is seasonal although any month from mid decemberto the beginning of may is fairly dry the annual range of precipitation goes from 2000 to 3500 mm from south to north the long term average annual precipitation in the barro colorado island located in gatun lake is 2600 mm and the average annual temperature is about 25 5 c fig 1 2 2 case study gatun lake data and sampling description the data used for the analysis correspond to measurements of physicochemical and biological parameters that determine the water quality at the sampling sites gamboa and paraiso located at gatun lake the data from 2009 was collected according to the protocols of the water quality unit of the panama canal authority three samples were collected at each site one meter from the surface samples were collected systematically every seven days until the first fourteen days of the month were completed from february to may and from july to december of 2009 measurements were taken in situ with a parametric probe ysi model 556 mps which had been previously verified and or calibrated at the laboratory appropriate containers were used for each sample glass polypropylene plastic etc collected samples were put in ice coolers and transported to the laboratory sampling sites were reached by land samples were collected to be analyzed at the laboratory of the water quality unit water division of the panama canal authority the analytical methods are described in the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha awwa wef 21 edition see table 1 a total of 12 water quality parameters was measured on site and at the laboratory which include temperature c ph transparency m turbidity ntu nitrates mg l orthophosphates mg l total phosphorus mg l total nitrogen mg l chlorophyll a μg l solar radiation langleys toxin microcystin μg l and dissolved oxygen mg l the samples for the toxin analysis microcystins were collected in amber glass containers and the analyses were carried out using the quanti tube method kit et039 from envirologix the solar radiation data was provided by the water resources section of the water division of the panama canal this data corresponds to the srfaa station located in balboa a total of 120 observations were obtained as a result of the three samples collected at each sampling site gamboa and paraiso twice a month on february feb march mar april apr may may july jul august aug september sep october oct november nov and december dec of 2009 each sample point is a sample that represents a month the number of times the collection is done during the month and the sampling site for example the sample point feb1p1 represents the month of february first sampling of the month at paraiso and the sample point feb2g2 represents the month of february second sampling of the month at gamboa gatun lake with a mean surface of 430 km2 forms a major part of the panama canal because of the existence of a large dam across the chagres river which was constructed between 1907 and 1913 it operates between water levels of 26 7 and 24 8 m abovesea level the gatún lake is the most important water reservoir for the canal operation it is located in the ancon corregimiento in panamá district iturralde amador and represa in la chorrera district and cristóbal limón nueva providencia cativa y sabanita corregimientos in colón district fig 2 2 3 methodology this methodology is articulated in three stages fig 3 first a descriptive analysis and hypothesis testing methodsof data was performed stage 1 after that the associations between the physicochemical and biological variables were searched and analyzed stage 2 lastly the physicochemical and biological variables that influenced the sets among the different sample points were identified stage 3 2 3 1 stage 1 basic statistical analysis for the analysis a matrix which contains 120 rows that represent the months and sampling points at the gamboa and paraiso locations and 12 columns physicochemical and biological variables was developed for this ten physicochemical and two biological variables have been considered the quantitative variables are described as mean standard deviation groups of comparisons were done using student s t 2 3 2 stage 2 hj biplot the main aim of the statistical analysis is to find the links between the physicochemical and biological variables for that the hj biplot technique which provides a graphic multivariate representation of rows and columns of a data matrix in a low dimensional subspace where their relative positions are interpretable was used the hj biplot representation technique allowed us to analyze all variables simultaneously biplot methodology is a statistical technique that consists of a graphic display of multivariate data the hj biplot galindo 1986 an extension of the classical biplots introduced by gabriel gabriel 1971 is an exploratory data analysis method that looks for hidden patterns in the data matrix hj biplot is a data representation technique consisting on visualizing a matrix of multivariate data x nxp using vectors as points called markers g 1 g 2 g n for each row and vectors called markers h 1 h 2 h p for each column each row represents a subject and each column a variable such that both markers sets can be superimposed onto the same reference system with the maximum quality of representation if the rows of a matrix a are described as markers g 1 g 2 g n and matrix b as markers h 1 h 2 h p it is obtained x a b t the markers are obtained from the usual singular value decomposition svd of the data matrix the singular value decomposition svd of matrix x is defined by x u d v t where u is the matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of x x t v is the matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of x t x and d is the matrix diagonal of singular values λ i of x let a and b be the matrices of the first two columns of ud and vd respectively for this paper the main goal of the hj biplot is to describe the relations between the row markers points of sampling and column markers physicochemical and biological variables regarding the interpretation rules of the hj biplot the proximity between individuals or row markers points of sampling is interpreted as a similarity the angles between two vectors joining two variables column markers with the origin are interpreted as a correlation and the proximity between a group of row markers and a column marker is defined in terms of preponderance summarizing two variables separated by a small angle are strongly correlated and a group of points of sampling next to a variable indicate that the individuals have taken preponderant values for this variable by projecting the points of sampling over the vectors that represent the physicochemical and biological variables it is possible to determine de approximate distribution that the points assume over these variables 2 3 3 stage 3 cluster analysis to identify the groupings the different points of sampling and the affected variables a cluster analysis has been conducted clustering is the process of grouping for identifying homogenous groups of individuals or objects the clusters were calculated through the biplot coordinates k means method euclidean distance the k means algorithm forgy 1965 macqueen 1967 is one of most used clustering algorithm in exploratory data analysis this method classifies a set of data into k number of disjoint clusters the algorithm for k means clustering is following as 1 to fix number of desired clusters 2 to initialize k centroids here a centroid is just the average of points of sampling in a cluster 3 the next step it takes each point of sampling to the cluster which has nearest centroid the euclidean distance is used to determine the distance between data points of sampling and the centroids 4 after all points of sampling have been assigned to clusters recalculate the centroids for each cluster 5 to repeat the points of sampling assignments and centroid calculations until no change in assignment occurs between iterations 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical and biological lake characterization the results referring to the physicochemical and biological variables are presented in table 2 this data suggests that during the analyzed period there are significant differences between gamboa and paraiso on the following variables ph p 0 01 transparency p 0 01 turbidity p 0 01 nitrates p 0 004 and toxin microcystin p 0 004 in general gamboa has less depth and more aquatic vegetation than paraiso this site receives a continuous flow of fresh water from the chilibre river and the middle section of the chagres river in paraiso there is little water transparency 2 0 m of depth this site is close to the navigation channel so that it is largely influenced by the transit of ships which suggests greater water turbulence as well as dredging activities that could favor an increase in suspended particles and as a result of this and increase in turbidity paraiso lake had the highest ph mean 7 27 turbidity mean 29 83 transparency mean 0 52 and nitrates mean 0 20 and lowest toxin mean0 12 turbidity was found to be in the range of 5 0 117 0 mean 29 83 in paraiso high values of turbidity have been reported in the others studies almeida et al 2012 brezonik et al 2005 high turbidity levels can reduce the amount of light reaching lower depths in bodies of water like lakes which inhibits growth of some forms of aquatic plants and can negatively affect species like furthermore ph is one of the most important factors in measuring water quality in the present study the range of the ph lies within 6 11 and 8 03 gupta et al 2017 and kumari et al 2013 reported comparative studies of physicochemical parameters of narmada river and found the range of ph is 7 4 8 8 in the month of april which is very much closer to the present study the physicochemical and biological variables that were analyzed are represented using vectors while the sampling areas can be identified through points their colors vary according to the month and sampling location gamboa y paraiso fig 4 shows the representation of the 1 2 factorial plane that resulted from the hj biplot which explains the 48 23 of the variance on the first axis the variables with the greatest variability were turbidity nitrates orthophosphates oxygen transparency and chlorophyll a this variability in transparency turbidity nitrates and orthophosphates could be explained by a stationary gradient related to the beginning of the rainy season and the nutrient contribution brought on by the runoff while the variability in chlorophyll a and oxygen may be associated to changes in temperature and wind as well as nutrient contribution which may affect the number of algae and at the same time the concentration of chlorophyll a this analysis showed that chlorophyll a water transparency and ph were strongly related and strongly negative correlations with nitrate turbidity and orthophosphates this is in good agreement with the conclusion made by cardille et al 2004 the study conducted by brezonik et al 2005 explored relationships between this variables for 15 minnesota lakes and they found turbidity and chlorophyll a had strongly positive correlations with one another and negative correlations with transparency however results from this study show a negative association of the turbidity and chlorophyll a carried out contrary to the results of this study these discrepancies are probably due to differences in sources of materials nutrients and suspended solids in line with the results from this research wu and kuo 2012 in a study in the feitsui reservoir watershed of taipei taiwan found association between the oxygen and chlorophyll a the second axis is determined by solar radiation and toxin which appear at the bottom part of the plane where the highest values of these variables are observed in september on the first sampling of the month in both zones gamboa and paraiso and october and november at the gamboa area on the second sampling in contrast to those months august and may in paraiso and gamboa on the second sampling are characterized mostly by higher temp temperature values both variables appear to have high correlation previous studies at the valmayor reservoir in spain showed that microcystin could photodegrade itself in surface systems reducing the quantity of toxins in the water wörmer et al 2010 it is important to highlight that the toxin is the most important variable to discriminate among the sampling points on axis 2 and that it is also an indicator with good variability in the study in contrast to these months august and may in paraíso and gamboa in the second sampling they are mainly characterized by higher temperature values this effect or seasonal variation of the temperature present in our study is also reflected in the study of the coast of mumbai grupta et al 2009 and likewise in the water quality investigation of the feitsui basin wu and kuo 2012 similarly there is some correlation between the nitrate turbidity and orthophosphate variables which show particularly high values on the months of september and october in both areas during the first and second sampling and on the first sampling in october in paraiso the inflow of nutrients varies through time depending on soil use and other factors during the summer the inflow of nutrients may increase due to the fertilization of crops whereas during winter heavy rains cause increased runoff of organic material such as leaves trunks vegetation and other organic remains that continue to decompose and as a result give rise to organic material and nutrients moreover no relationships were observed between turbidity and nitrates with solar radiation similarly the toxin has no relationship with orthophosphates 3 2 clustering according to sample points the cluster analysis was carried out based on the coordinates obtained from the hj biplot k means method cosine two clusters were formed with the different sample points on the graphic representation the clusters identified through the convex hulls lines fig 5 can be observed this analysis allowed us to identify the physicochemical and biological variables that influenced the sets among the different sample points table 3 shows the representation qualities for each conglomerate on plane 1 2 the clusters can be characterized as cluster 1 it is formed by the sample points in gamboa and paraiso on december february march april and may the variables present on this cluster are ph transparency chlorophyll a oxygen and temperature temp the months and variables associated in this cluster suggest possibilities regarding the physicochemical processes that occur at these sites of gatun lake during the dry season there was higher water transparency ph dissolved oxygen chlorophyll a and temperature but these parameters varied with respect to other months of the rainy season cluster 2 it is formed by the sample points taken mainly in may at paraiso in july august september october and november this cluster is formed the following variables nitrates orthophosphates turbidity and p total the link between months and variables suggests that when rainfall starts nutrients such as nitrates orthophosphates and total phosphorus are transported by suspended particles turbidity that are carried by runoff and then reach gamboa and paraiso the highest concentrations for each one of these variables are found during the rainy season and as a result of the increase in nutrients high sporadic values of chlorophyll a are found maximum value of 47 6 µg l during the rainy season this suggests that phytoplankton groups such as cyanobacteria could be gaining advantage over algae cyanobacteria have physiological mechanisms gas vacuoles which allow them to move along the water column and reach depths where nutrients are available where the temperature is optimal and where other conditions are favorable to them rigosi et al 2014 whereas algae green diatoms red etc are affected by turbidity because it blocks the light needed for photosynthesis gomes and juneau 2017 plantsneed nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus for growth but excessive concentrations can trigger algae blooms simth 2003 although the turbity in water could be caused by this association during the wet season so far this research comprises the only study on water quality in the panama canal watershed where the multivariate method of two hj biplot galindo 1986 routes was applied this has allowed to evaluate the physicochemical and biological processes related to seasonal changes dry and rainy in gamboa and paraíso sites in the gatún reservoir during the analyzed period this method also offers the advantage of allowing a representation of the sampling points rows and the physicochemical and biological variables columns simultaneously on the same coordinate system also this method provides a high representation quality both for the sampling points and for the physicochemical and biological variables however this method presents a limitation on the the data matrix original element xij representation although this limitation it is not an impediment for this method to be useful for the evaluation of water quality in an aquatic environment and to detect multivariate patterns in a complex group of data with different variables the grouping of the sampling months and the variables allow us to understand the complex nature of water quality issues in time and space and simultaneously interpret the behavior of the reservoir at a given time therefore these methods are useful for the evaluation of water quality in an aquatic environment and to detect multivariate patterns in a complex group of data with different variables 4 conclusions hydrochemical as well as hydrological and hydrodynamic behavior are intimately related especially in water systems like lakes lagoons and coastal water systems in general but also in rivers and streams there are several aspects provided by hj biplot approach that directly contribute to deepen the hydrochemical knowledge and consequently improve the hydrological and hydrodynamic understanding and interpretation of water systems these aspects may comprise the identification and quantification of hydrological budgets a clearer and deeper temporal dynamic identification of relationships between the physicochemical and biological variables as well as the sampling points through different months a better identification of the sources of pollution and the delimitation of the polluted zones improvement of hydrodynamics and hydraulics of water systems through a deeper understanding of mixing processes for contaminants sediments loadings or any other component all these previous mechanisms largely drive the processes of sedimentation and stratification of the layers lakes as well as wide rivers or estuaries and in general coastal water systems in this study a novel approach based on the development of hj biplot technique have allowed generating a new interpretation knowledge and evaluation about the water quality of gatun lake in this sense it facilitated the interpretation of the similarities dissimilarities between individuals sampling points the covariation between physicochemical and biological variables and even more important it determined which variables indicate the differences between the various sampling points the hj biplot has a descriptive character that has allowed seeing on a plane in a simple and clear manner the joint representation between the physicochemical and biological variables through the different months in both study areas hence this technique has allowed obtaining relationships between both physicochemical and biological variables as well as between the sampling points through different months the hj biplot proves to be an efficient tool for water quality studies in this case it showed that february and august in the second sample collection and october in the first one were the months that had the most influence in the water quality variability the results obtained in this study identify two well differentiated clusters according to the months of the season in the region to obtain a multivariate characterization one cluster comprised months and variables associated with the dry season it is a period of greater water transparency and high levels of the oxygen concentration ph values temperature measurements and chlorophyll a content the other cluster was composed of months and variables associated with wet season which is characterized by rains highnitrates orthophosphates and total phosphorus concentrations and sporadically high levels of chlorophyll a with values of up to 47 6 6 µg l this produces that phytoplankton groups like cyanobacteria could take advantage over algae based on the information obtained it is possible to better understand the complex issues of water quality and monitoring in the region in space and time furthermore this multivariate approach allowed a reliable classification of points of sampling from the study area as well as a better strategy for future monitoring finally this research and approach is expected to be useful for improving the knowledge on the general

6246,the urban drainage model is an important tool for the management and decision making around an urban drainage network owing to urban drainage networks complex distribution existing model analysis methods have gradually exposed problems of insufficient utilization of spatial information weak coupling and analytical capacity of multi source heterogeneous data and poor human computer interaction by coupling an urban drainage model with 3d gis technology and 3d visualization technology this study presents a 3d dynamic visualization method of an urban drainage model 3ddvm udm a case study from chaohu china is used to demonstrate the method the environmental information and distributions of pipe network objects in 3d space were presented the urban drainage model can be edited and simulated in the 3d environment and a 2d flooding simulation method was also established multiple model results were dynamically and simultaneously visualized in the pipe network entity models by coupling and comparing the model results under different rainfall return periods various information was intuitively analyzed such as the water level and water quality differences of each pipe and node and the spatial distribution differences of fully filled pipes overflowed nodes and buildings influenced by node overflow the operation state of a drainage pipe network can be systematically analyzed by intuitively combining with the attribute information of a pipe network 3d spatial information and other relevant data this study provides a feasible theory and method to assist in environmental management and decision making to facilitate communication between different fields and to promote a shift in analysis from 2d to the combination of 2d and 3d keywords urban drainage model 3d dynamic visualization spatial information multi source heterogeneous data human computer interaction 1 introduction there are many measures in the planning design treatment and management of drainage systems boogaard and eslamian 2015 among which urban drainage models have been widely applied bach et al 2018 dotto et al 2014 freni et al 2009 urban drainage models represent a useful tool for simulating and estimating the efficiency of urban drainage systems by means of numerical simulation jang et al 2018 zoppou 2001 numerous simulation results that change over time and space are generated when running the model joost and timothy 2012 salvadore et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 difficulties are regularly encountered when analyzing the model s results and extracting valuable information wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2011a with urban rapid expansion the distribution of drainage pipe networks is becoming more and more complex when devising reconstruction plans based on the urban drainage model the demand for 3d space information such as the distribution characteristics of drainage pipe networks progressively increases at the same time many other multi source heterogeneous data with multiple dimensions and complex geographical relations must be considered astrid et al 2017 maha and orland 2018 zhang et al 2011b for example in the process of analyzing nodal flood data in the model results the influence on buildings above cannot be ignored the attribute information of buildings such as geographical location size height and so on should be considered therefore how to effectively utilize spatial information couple and parse the existing multi source heterogeneous data and improve the decision support efficiency of the model s results represents a significant challenge existing analytical methods of urban drainage models primarily exist in two dimensions including 2d charts and paper reports however because the 2d data expression and analysis method is used to project geographic objects from 3d space to a 2d plane the geometric position and spatial topological information in the third dimension are lost zhang et al 2016 this method is relatively poor at analyzing the spatial characteristics and correlation of objects information cannot be reflected completely and objectively allen et al 2004 huang et al 2009 moreover this method is rather ineffective at coupling multi source heterogeneous data and facilitating a systematic analysis of existing problems as a result substantial amounts of data are unable to be effectively analyzed and utilized which is inappropriate to decision making needs in complex space he et al 2011 lai et al 2011 in addition owing to the size of model results and the complex structure of data required for analysis it is difficult to communicate between different fields zhang et al 2015 in recent years with the development of computer hardware and software 3d visualization technology has been applied in numerous fields brovelli and zamboni 2012 chen et al 2018 lee et al 2018 owing to its advantages in multidimensional space it provides an advanced tool and method for coupling and parsing multi source heterogeneous data liu et al 2018 trubka et al 2016 in the field of urban drainage research 3d visualization technology is at present predominantly used to show the distribution and attribute information of pipe networks he et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 and has yet to be combined with the urban drainage model the information provided for analysis and decision making remains limited and the capacity for data coupling and parsing are constrained breunig and zlatanova 2011 therefore it is necessary to study the ways in which 3d visualization technology can be successfully applied to couple with an urban drainage model this may help solve the above problems in the existing model of analysis process and provide effective decision support the objectives of this study were thus to i synchronously analyze time series data such as water level water quality flow direction and flow rate and the ground building information influenced by node flood in the form of 3d dynamic visualization ii synchronously compare and analyze different models in the form of 3d dynamic visualization iii provide a feasible theory and method to solve the problems of insufficient utilization of spatial information poor coupling and parsing capabilities of multi source heterogeneous data in the analysis process of urban drainage model to improve human computer interactions and to promote the development of visualization and analysis methods from 2d to the combination of 2d and 3d 2 methodology in this study the establishment of 3ddvm udm includes four parts 1 rapid construction of a 3d geographic environment 2 storage and coupling of multi source heterogeneous data 3 design of a 3d dynamic visualization method and 4 coupling urban drainage model with the 3d dynamic visualization method the framework of the methodology is shown in fig 1 2 1 rapid construction of the 3d geographic environment based on 3d gis technology the 3d geographic environment is primarily constructed by integrating remote sensing image data dem data 3d ground building models and 3d entity models of drainage pipe network it provides environment support for 3d dynamic visualization of urban drainage model results in this study the 3d geographic environment was constructed based on the unity3d engine platform remote sensing image data was superimposed on the dem data according to the consistency of geographical location to constructing the basic 3d environment as for the 3d building models on the ground this study mainly focused on the overall shape of buildings with fewer requirements for the appearance by extracting the building boundary and height from the remote sensing image data the 3d building models were constructed with a simple and rapid batch processing method according to the spatial and attribute data of the pipe network including the position size and height of nodes length diameter and burial depth of pipes the 3d entity models of the drainage pipe network were established by rapid batch and manual optimization methods 2 2 storage and coupling of multi source heterogeneous data multi source heterogeneous data can be divided into structured and unstructured data in the aspect of 3d dynamic visualization of drainage pipe network model structured data primarily include attribute data of pipe network and buildings model input data and simulation results unstructured data mainly include remote sensing image data dem data and pictures in this study for the storage and coupling of structured data the rational database was used database application contained data reading and writing operations which were used to store the attribute data of pipe network and buildings model input data and simulation results from external files or convert these stored data into the required format to use outside for the attribute data of the pipe network and buildings they can be read and written in the database with the query method after obtaining the ids of the corresponding objects as identifiers in 3d environment for the model input data they were stored in the database and utilized when the model input file was generated for the simulation results they were stored in the database as a single data table and correlated with each other according to the consistency of time information given that an object corresponds to a set of time series data the id of each object in the urban drainage system can be obtained under the 3d environment as an identifier to establish a connection between the object and the corresponding data in the database for unstructured data they were stored in file mode structured data and unstructured data were correlated by the identifier of object in the 3d environment 2 3 design of the 3d dynamic visualization method according to the characteristic of model results and the topological relationship between data in this study the corresponding 3d dynamic visualization method was designed 2 3 1 3d dynamic visualization of the single model scenario this primarily comprised the 3d dynamic visualization of model results of pipes and nodes as well as ground buildings influenced by flood water in this study for the 3d visualization of model results related to pipes and nodes the method of filling the 3d water object in the pipe network entity model was adopted as detailed below 2 3 1 1 pipe object this mainly included the 3d dynamic visualization of water level water quality flow rate and flow direction the 3d water object was filled in the pipe entity model and initially its id size and direction were the same as that of the pipe the water object of different types of pipes was visualized in different basic colors as the distinction the id of the water object was used as the identifier to get the corresponding model results by limiting the color rendering range of mesh vertices of water objects the water level data could be converted into the variation of water height in the pipes as shown in eqs 1 3 and fig 2 the color transition method was used to represent the variation in water quality in the pipes based on the basic color of the water object the water quality data was converted into the change of color shade of mesh vertices for the vertex in the x direction of the local coordinates of pipes where the position is greater than or equal to 0 1 y i y min h transparent color y i y min h basic color otherwise 2 y i y min h transparent color y i y min h basic color 3 h d m h r d where yi represents the vertex position of the water object in the y direction y min is the minimum value of the vertex position of the water object at x 0 y min is the minimum value of the vertex position of the water object at x 0 dm is the diameter of the 3d pipe entity model d is the actual diameter of the pipe h r is the simulated water level data in the model results h is the water height of the 3d pipe entity model the 3d dynamic visualization of pipe flow direction was represented by a 3d arrow of moderate size generated in each pipe in this study there were two coordinate systems including the global coordinate of the 3d environment and the local coordinate of the objects which were shown in fig 3 e since the positive direction of the local coordinate x of each pipe pointed to the positive direction of the global coordinate x and was parallel to the pipe slope we can generate a suitably sized arrow in each pipe and initially set the directions of each arrow as the same as that of the pipe thereby the direction of the local coordinate x of the arrow can be used to represent the positive or opposite flow direction furthermore the x direction of the local coordinate of the arrow should be rotated by 0 or 180 according to the position relationship between the start and end nodes in the x and z directions the position information of the start and end nodes was generally obtained from the model input file or the database through the identifier the relationship between the positions of the start and end nodes and the arrow direction was shown in eq 4 corresponding to fig 3 a fig d the 3d dynamic visualization of flow velocity was represented by changing the length and color of the arrow 4 x en x sn 0 z en z sn 0 0 0 0 x en x sn 0 z en z sn 0 180 0 0 x en x sn 0 z en z sn 0 0 0 0 x en x sn 0 z en z sn 0 180 0 0 where x en is the position of the end node in the x direction x sn is the position of the start node in the x direction z en is the position of the end node in the z direction z sn is the position of the start node in the z direction 2 3 1 2 node object this primarily included the 3d dynamic visualization of the water level and water quality akin to the pipes the 3d water object was filled in the node entity and assigned with the model results the water object of different types of nodes was visualized in different basic colors as the distinction according to the eqs 5 8 eq 8 was concluded by eqs 5 7 the water level data could be converted into the variation of water height in the nodes as shown in fig 4 the color transition method was also adopted to represent the variation in water quality in the nodes 5 h nm h nr h wm h wr 6 s y h wm s ymax h nm 7 s ymax h nm h wm 8 s y h nm h wm h nr h wr where h nm is the height of the 3d node entity model h nr is the actual height of the node h wm is the water level in the 3d node entity model h wr is the simulated water level of the node s ymax is the maximum proportion of the water object within the node h wm is the initial height of the water object within the node s y is the scale of the water object within the node 2 3 1 3 buildings influenced by flood water for the 3d dynamic visualization of ground buildings influenced by flood water it was necessary to detect whether the flood points were within the scope of buildings in real time when calculating potential areas of inundation the spatial distribution of the affected buildings was obtained by highlighting them 2 3 2 3d dynamic comparison of multi model scenarios for the comparison of multi model scenarios the data was coupled and the multi view mode was adopted to perform 3d dynamic comparisons either synchronously or asynchronously synchronous analysis meant that the perspective and position of multiple views changed at the same time and the data variation of each object under different scenarios could be compared under the same perspective asynchronous analysis indicated that the perspective changes of multiple views were in discordance when the mouse entered the field of view the view could be rotated and zoomed without affecting other fields of view 2 4 coupling urban drainage model with the 3d dynamic visualization method at present there are many drainage modelling tools including the storm water management model swmm infoworks cs and mike urban bisht et al 2016 van der sterren et al 2014 zhu et al 2016 they can be divided into commercial type and open source type commercial drainage models are costly and cannot be redeveloped the 3d dynamic visualization method can only be loosely coupled with these models through compiling the data interface program to retrieve results from the model for open source drainage models their source codes can be packaged and embedded into the 3d dynamic visualization method through referring to the calculation module and result reading module in the model the 3d dynamic visualization method can be tightly coupled with the urban drainage model given that swmm is a free and open source software it is suitable for the secondary development of integration with other algorithms and software tools riaño briceño et al 2016 wang et al 2017 in this study swmm was selected to be coupled with the 3d dynamic visualization method the source code of swmm was packaged into a dynamic link library dll file which was loaded into the unity3d engine for calling the swmm input file could be created to some extent by editing its different sections in the 3d environment the external input file could also be read by selecting an object from the urban drainage system its corresponding information in the input file was obtained and further modified and saved by calling the computing module of the dll file different model scenarios were simulated by calling the result module of the dll file and writing the data interface numerous time series data of pipes nodes and subcatchments were extracted and stored in the database the precipitation falls on the earth s surface and then enters the drainage network due to the limited capacity of the pipes water may flood out from the nodes however swmm is a 1d rainfall runoff model which is unable to simulate the above ground flood routing using the flood water from nodes wu et al 2017 although coupled 1d 2d models were already a well established approach to simulate urban flooding in this study with the consideration of computational power and time a simplified method established by the source flooding algorithm chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 and the seeded region growing algorithm noman et al 2001 shen et al 2015 was adopted to construct the 2d overland flow model with less consideration paid to the two way interaction between the sewer system and the flood water the implementation process of the 2d overland flow model was as follows firstly the flooded node was set as the initial seed point then taking the seed point as the center the elevation of the surrounding point was sought and obtained in eight directions according to the gravity characteristics of the water flow the elevation of the surrounding point was compared with the water level at the seed point separately buildings were also cross detected in real time if the elevation of the surrounding point was lower than the water level at the seed point and the surrounding point did not fall within the scope of the buildings the surrounding point would be used as a new seed point and marked as a flood area if the elevation of the surrounding point within the range of the building was less than the water level of the seed point the building would be marked as an influenced building this process was repeated until no flood water remained finally the time series information regarding the influenced buildings was obtained and stored in the database 3 application and results 3 1 study area chaohu city is situated in the center of anhui province in eastern china with a subtropical humid monsoon climate qi et al 2015 qin et al 2014 it is located in the northeast of the lower yangtze region near chaohu lake chen et al 2011 yu et al 2011 the case study area is the central part of chaohu city which covers an area of 27 65 km2 it is a predominantly residential area the urban drainage system is complex with both separate and combined sewage systems the map and the 3d environment of the study area are shown in fig 5 and fig 6 f in this study the resolution of the remote sensing image was 1 m 1m and the data source was google map image fig 6 a the resolution of dem data was also 1 m 1m which was generated from data with a resolution of 10 m 10 m using the kriging interpolation method mosammam 2013 fig 6 b according to the method in section 2 1 956 ground buildings were constructed in the study area as displayed in fig 6 d by generalizing the urban drainage system including 589 pipes 583 nodes and 53 outlets the 3d entity models were established fig 6 e the coordinate system of the remote sensing image the dem data the drainage pipe network and the building boundary were all wgs 1984 3 2 designing and coupling the urban drainage model using the method in section 2 4 the drainage model was optimized and closely coupled with the 3d dynamic visualization method as displayed in fig 7 in the 3d environment some operations can be conducted including creating the swmm input file to some extent reading and editing the external input file simulating extracting and storing simulation results in the study area the design formula of storm intensity is displayed in eq 9 xu 2011 9 q 21 557 16 383 l g p t 14 0 84 where q is the storm intensity mm min p is the design return periods year and t is the rainfall duration min the rainfall processes of the different rainstorm return periods were determined by the chicago hydrograph model closest to the actual conditions rainfall return periods of 1 year 3 years 5 years 10 years 50 years and 100 years were designed the rainfall durations were all two hours 3 3 3d dynamic visualization of the urban drainage model 3 3 1 3d visualization of pipe network objects the distribution of underground drainage system is intricate and complex in this study through fully utilizing the attribute data such as the size and depth of pipes and nodes the representation of the pipe network object was transformed from a 2d point line and number to 3d entity models fig 6 e the height variation slope hierarchical distribution and the connections of the pipe network in vertical space were presented with the function of roaming in 3d space the researchers and decision makers were able to freely roam both outside and inside the underground pipe network by querying the properties of each pipe network object the objects that met the necessary criteria could be obtained and displayed the 3d entity models of the pipe network objects were further integrated with the 3d geographic environment and the 3d building models by altering the terrain s transparency the 3d geographical environment in which the pipe network objects were located was obtained including land use type terrain elevation as well as the drainage pipe network information corresponding to the buildings fig 8 3 3 2 3d dynamic visualization of single rainfall event according to the method of section 2 3 1 multiple types of data including water level water quality flow direction and flow velocity were simultaneously and dynamically visualized in the 3d environment fig 9 a c in terms of water level the water level data were transformed to the height variation of the water object the researchers and decision makers were able to simultaneously and intuitively access the dynamic change processes of water level and fullness outside or inside the underground pipe network by combining the attribute data such as the size and buried depth of pipe network objects when the node flooded it would be highlighted fig 9 b a 3d spatial distribution map of flooded nodes and fully filled pipes could also be generated fig 10 in terms of water quality because different types of pipes were visualized in different basic colors and the water quality data was converted into the variation of the color shade of the water object the water quality differences of pipe network objects can be obtained quickly and intuitively meanwhile the information of water quality standards was coupled when the water quality of the pipe network object met prerequisite standards the object would be highlighted in the 3d environment a 3d spatial distribution map of nodes and pipes that met water quality standards could also be generated by coupling the data regarding water level water quality flow direction and flow rate their variations and mutual relationships could be obtained and analyzed simultaneously by selecting the pipe network object its identifier was obtained which retrieved the corresponding attribute information and simulation results stored in the database these data could be visualized in the form of a graph in the 3d space environment of the object fig 9 c on the basis of the above 3d dynamic visualization of model results the analysis reports were generated to provide data support for decision making these demonstrated whether or not pipes and nodes met water quality standards whether or not pipes were fully filled and whether or not nodes flooded the information was detailed including the name position and time series data of the corresponding object 3 3 3 3d dynamic visualization of ground buildings influenced by flood water due to the coupling of the ground 3d building model in the analysis process of drainage model the underground information and above ground information including the underground drainage pipe network simulation results ground buildings and dem data can be integrated for correlation analysis the water level and water quality changes of the corresponding pipes and nodes under each building were obtained intuitively fig 9 b as the node flooded the influenced buildings were highlighted in the 3d environment and the number was counted fig 9 d the 3d spatial distribution map of flooded nodes and influenced buildings under different rainfall return periods was also generated fig 11 the information regarding the influenced buildings including name location and time series data was also stored into external files to support decision making 3 3 4 3d dynamic visualization comparison of different rainfall events according to the method of section 2 3 2 the model results from two to six scenarios were coupled the 3d dynamic comparison analysis was performed in a multi view manner either synchronously or asynchronously here the comparison of model results under two different rainfall return periods including 1 year and 3 year periods is presented in the 3d environment the differences in water level fullness and water quality of the same pipe network objects were obtained intuitively for example for the pipe of number 1 in fig 10 a the pipe was not fully filled when the rain lasted for 50 min under the rainfall return period of 1 year however this pipe was fully filled under the rainfall return period of 3 years for the node of number 2 the water quality met the standard of level3 when the rain lasted for 50 min under the rainfall return period of 1 year under the rainfall return period of 3 years the water quality of this node did not meet this standard and the water level was higher than that of 1 year for the node of number 3 in fig 10 b under the rainfall return period of 1 year there was no flood at this node when the rain lasted for 68 min however flood occurred when the rainfall return period was 3 years at the same time according to the color shade of the water inside the node the water quality data of the rainfall return period of 1 year was higher than that of 3 years therefore the differences in pipes and nodes meeting the standards and the differences of multiple types of model results could be obtained and analyzed intuitively by selecting the pipe network object the corresponding attribute information and the model results under different rainfall return period could be obtained and displayed in the 3d environment meanwhile the distribution differences of flooded nodes and fully filled pipes under different rainfall events could be analyzed in a multi perspective way as shown in fig 11 in combination with the 3d ground building models the differences in water level and water quality of the nodes and pipes under each building as well as the spatial distributions of buildings influenced by flood water were obtained fig 11 at the same time statistical reports of the model results under different rainfall events were generated as displayed in table 1 these included the number of fully filled pipes the number of flooded nodes the number of buildings influenced and their respective percentages relative to the total number according to fig 11 and table 1 little difference exists between the proportion of fully filled pipes under different rainfall return periods in the study area however relative to the total number of pipes all proportions were large up to 50 percent their distributions were primarily concentrated in the central urban area and around the west huancheng river and tianhe river therefore the proportion and distribution range of the pipes that needed to be reconstructed were large which indicated high operating pressure of the pipe network in the study area the distribution of flooded nodes was also principally concentrated in the central urban area and around the east huancheng river west huancheng river and tianhe river as the rainfall return period increased the proportion gradually increased reaching a maximum of 21 44 this indicated that the condition of node flood was not optimistic aside from the rainfall events of 3 years and 5 years the proportions of flooded nodes between other rainfall return periods were significantly different the increased areas were mainly concentrated on the three main roads middle jiankang road chaohu road and renmin road the influenced buildings were primarily located on both sides of the roads in the central urban area as well as around the west huancheng river and tianhe river with an increased rainfall return period the influenced buildings gradually increased in number especially concentrated near renmin road and chaohu road given that the influenced buildings were mainly concentrated near the main roads of the city affecting traffic and residents lives mitigation strategies must be taken a video about section 3 2 and section 3 3 was supplied in the supplementary material 4 discussion 4 1 utilization of spatial information traditional expression methods of drainage pipe network objects in 2d are primarily point line and plane for example fig 12 a highlights the distribution of pipes and nodes at the intersection of renmin road and tuanjie road three types of pipes with complex distributions and mixed connection phenomena are apparent owing to the lack of effective use of spatial attribute information such as size and depth of pipes and nodes the traditional expression method is unable to show their height variations and hierarchical distribution relationships in 3d space the attribute information can only provide decision making support in the form of simple numbers changing with the spatial distribution although it can represent the mixed connection state it is not sufficiently specific to present the problem due to the dearth of 3d information it restricts researchers and decision makers intuitive knowledge and understanding of the research object which is not conducive to solving the problem besides the dem data can t be fully utilized to represent the 3d geographical environment of the study object through using the 3d visualization method the pipe network object is represented in 3d from 2d point 2d line and a large amount of numeric data for example fig 12 b is the result of the 3d transformation of fig 12 a in comparing fig 12 a with fig 12 b we can clearly recognize the advantage of the 3d visualization expression mode relative to the 2d plane mode in terms of the utilization of spatial information it is very effective for rapidly understanding the connectivity and size relationship of different pipes and nodes the variations of pipe slope the hierarchical distribution relationship as well as the problem of mixed connection can also be intuitively recognized in 3d space in a multi perspective way meanwhile the topographic data and the ground building information can be intuitively coupled as a result the utilization of spatial information becomes more complete the researchers and decision makers can have a systematic and intuitive understanding of the research object and the entire urban drainage model 4 2 coupling and parsing of multi source heterogeneous data 4 2 1 aspect of single scenario analysis existing analytical method of the urban drainage model primarily analyze the model results in 2d for example for the water level variation of nodes the analysis method is primarily in terms of the color change of the 2d point graph fig 13 a or variations in the node profile fig 13 b for the water level variation of pipes the analysis method is predominantly the color change of the 2d linear graph fig 13 a or variations in the pipe profile fig 13 b however for the data analysis method of color changes in 2d given that this is not highly correlated with the vertical attribute information and the characteristics of the study objects researchers and decision makers cannot attain an intuitive and rapid understanding of changes in the model s results and problems of the pipe network furthermore some optimization measures of the pipe network cannot be proposed systematically although the data analysis method of the profile can be combined with attribute data related to the results of the drainage system it is not highly integrated with the object environment where the data is located moreover connectivity between the selected start and end nodes needs to exist prior to profile analysis thus owing to the lack of systematic analysis of data in space this method is not able to significantly enhance researchers and decision makers understanding of data and improve communication between different fields in the analysis process of the flooded node the influence of ground buildings is a factor that cannot be ignored however the existing analytical method of the urban drainage model cannot intuitively couple the information of buildings such as the height data and obtain the changes in water level and water quality of nodes and pipes under buildings it is impossible to carry out specific analysis of influenced buildings in a multi perspective way in this study by adopting the 3ddvm udm diverse multi source heterogeneous data including remote sensing image data dem data 3d ground building models and the attribute data of pipe network were coupled therefore the above ground data and invisible underground data were visualized and analyzed in a natural and integrated way on this basis the drainage model results are further coupled and dynamically visualized and analyzed in the 3d space of the corresponding drainage pipe network objects for example by associating with the node height the water level data are transformed to the height variation of the water object within the node and pipe which corresponds with the variation pattern in the real environment as displayed in fig 13 d the buildings influenced by node flood are quickly identified and the corresponding attribute information is also obtained multiple types of model results are also analyzed simultaneously meanwhile since the drainage system is analyzed as a whole in 3d the relationship between the data of any pipe network object and other objects can be analyzed systematically and comprehensively there is no need to consider whether there is connectivity between the start node and the end node therefore when the drainage model is used for the optimization of a pipe network in comparison to the 2d data analysis method the 3ddvm udm can extract efficient information from large amounts of data and improve the efficiency of data analysis and decision making according to the correlations between multiple data some targeted prevention and protection measures can be proposed for improving the overflow and water quality conditions of the pipe network mitigating the influence of flooding on buildings or comprehensively considering multiple aims such as increasing the diameter of corresponding pipes changing the height of nodes and modifying the slope of pipes 4 2 2 aspect of scenario comparison the existing analysis methods of the urban drainage model primarily compare the simulation results from different scenarios by selecting typical objects and adopting the form of 2d charts these methods result in data lacking systematic and comprehensive analysis there are also a few methods to compare the simulation results of multiple scenarios in a multi view manner however it is difficult to achieve the desired comparative effect due to insufficient combination with study object and other multi source heterogeneous data as shown in fig 13 c in contrast by adopting the 3ddvm udm the model results under different rainfall return periods are systematically coupled the differences in water level and water quality of each pipe network object the buildings influenced by flood water as well as the water level and water quality of the corresponding pipe network objects under each building are analyzed intuitively and comprehensively in the overall analysis of the model results researchers and decision makers can directly access considerable comparative information in the object environment where the data is located fig 11 this information includes the differences in the satisfaction of different water quality standards for pipes and nodes during the whole rainfall process as well as the differences in the spatial distributions of flooded nodes fully filled pipes and buildings influenced by flood water therefore by using this method multiple types of information become more closely related the researchers and decision makers can analyze the operational conditions of a drainage system under different rainfall return periods systematically so as to make decisions based on more comprehensive and reliable information 4 3 improvement of human machine interaction in the process of drainage model analysis many complicated sources of information need to be considered currently researchers and decision makers cannot interact with the study object and conduct in depth analysis of data from multiple perspectives which is not conducive to the acquisition of data and exploration of potential information in this study by constructing the 3d environment the model results are directly and dynamically visualized in a way that is close to the change in objects in the real environment it enables researchers to roam in the study area the simulation results can be analyzed and explored in a multi perspective and interactive manner by rendering the presentation and analysis of data more realistic results are more likely to be accepted by those who have no technical background or who lack a profound understanding of a particular problem meanwhile it is also conducive to promoting communication between different fields thus this method can greatly improve the human machine interaction 4 4 applicability of the 3ddvm udm to other regions when the 3ddvm udm is applied to other regions we can first establish the corresponding 3d environment through the rapid construction method of 3d environment in section 2 1 the algorithm and code established in this study are generic they can be easily applied to the corresponding objects in the 3d environment of other regions some operations can be conducted including creating the swmm input file to some extent reading and editing the external input file simulating extracting and storing simulation results as well as 3d dynamic visualization analysis of data in comparison with other 3d visualization tools the development processes are relatively similar based on the existing models these tools are all developed by proposing and establishing some novel algorithms for coupling visualization and interaction of multi source heterogenous data the method proposed in this study mainly focuses on the research of 3d dynamic visualization of drainage pipe network model which supplements some existing researches such as the three dimensional dynamic visualization of flooding leskens et al 2017 and ground water tian et al 2016 4 5 future work when creating the input file of the swmm model in the 3d environment some parameters including manning coefficient and infiltration coefficient cannot be edited which needs to be improved in the future some experiments need to be conducted to validate the usefulness of this methodology by asking experts and practitioners to use it the accuracy of the overland flow model also needs to be tested by comparing with real flood data and other tools such as 2d shallow water models leandro and martins 2016 and other simplified flood spreading algorithms bermúdez et al 2018 chen et al 2009 given that the development platform used in this study is highly integrated with virtual reality vr technology this method can be further combined with vr technology in the future thus the management and decision making of urban drainage systems can be conducted in an immersive and in depth way in addition because monitoring data is the input condition of the model simulation we can combine this method with online monitoring technology of the pipe network in the future thus the urban drainage system can visualize the monitoring data of the 3d entities of the drainage pipe network dynamically and in real time and carry out real time simulation and 3d dynamic visualization of prediction results so as to provide better early warning information 5 conclusion given the deficiencies of the existing 2d analysis method for the urban drainage model a 3ddvm udm was established in this study by coupling the urban drainage model with 3d gis technology and 3d visualization technology the feasibility of this method is carried out using the example of chaohu city china a range of multi source heterogeneous data were integrated including remote sensing image data dem data ground building information and the attribute data of the urban drainage system on this basis the urban drainage model was further tightly coupled multiple types of model data including water level water quality flow velocity and flow direction were visualized in the 3d entity of the corresponding pipe and nodes simultaneously and dynamically in a way close to reality the ground buildings influenced by node flood were also visualized in the 3d environment by coupling comparing and analyzing the model data under different rainfall return periods substantial comparative information could be directly accessed in the 3d environment where the data were located this information included differences in the water level and water quality of each pipe and node during the entire rainfall process adherence to different water quality standards as well as the spatial distribution of flooded nodes fully filled pipes and buildings influenced by node flood based on the model results targeted pipe network reconstruction measures and preventive measures can thus be systematically proposed through intuitively combining with the multi source heterogeneous data related to data analysis the study results show that the 3ddvm udm can fully utilize the spatial information and solve the problem of using multi source heterogeneous data it is conducive to improving the human machine interaction enhancing communication between different fields and assisting in environmental management

6246,the urban drainage model is an important tool for the management and decision making around an urban drainage network owing to urban drainage networks complex distribution existing model analysis methods have gradually exposed problems of insufficient utilization of spatial information weak coupling and analytical capacity of multi source heterogeneous data and poor human computer interaction by coupling an urban drainage model with 3d gis technology and 3d visualization technology this study presents a 3d dynamic visualization method of an urban drainage model 3ddvm udm a case study from chaohu china is used to demonstrate the method the environmental information and distributions of pipe network objects in 3d space were presented the urban drainage model can be edited and simulated in the 3d environment and a 2d flooding simulation method was also established multiple model results were dynamically and simultaneously visualized in the pipe network entity models by coupling and comparing the model results under different rainfall return periods various information was intuitively analyzed such as the water level and water quality differences of each pipe and node and the spatial distribution differences of fully filled pipes overflowed nodes and buildings influenced by node overflow the operation state of a drainage pipe network can be systematically analyzed by intuitively combining with the attribute information of a pipe network 3d spatial information and other relevant data this study provides a feasible theory and method to assist in environmental management and decision making to facilitate communication between different fields and to promote a shift in analysis from 2d to the combination of 2d and 3d keywords urban drainage model 3d dynamic visualization spatial information multi source heterogeneous data human computer interaction 1 introduction there are many measures in the planning design treatment and management of drainage systems boogaard and eslamian 2015 among which urban drainage models have been widely applied bach et al 2018 dotto et al 2014 freni et al 2009 urban drainage models represent a useful tool for simulating and estimating the efficiency of urban drainage systems by means of numerical simulation jang et al 2018 zoppou 2001 numerous simulation results that change over time and space are generated when running the model joost and timothy 2012 salvadore et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 difficulties are regularly encountered when analyzing the model s results and extracting valuable information wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2011a with urban rapid expansion the distribution of drainage pipe networks is becoming more and more complex when devising reconstruction plans based on the urban drainage model the demand for 3d space information such as the distribution characteristics of drainage pipe networks progressively increases at the same time many other multi source heterogeneous data with multiple dimensions and complex geographical relations must be considered astrid et al 2017 maha and orland 2018 zhang et al 2011b for example in the process of analyzing nodal flood data in the model results the influence on buildings above cannot be ignored the attribute information of buildings such as geographical location size height and so on should be considered therefore how to effectively utilize spatial information couple and parse the existing multi source heterogeneous data and improve the decision support efficiency of the model s results represents a significant challenge existing analytical methods of urban drainage models primarily exist in two dimensions including 2d charts and paper reports however because the 2d data expression and analysis method is used to project geographic objects from 3d space to a 2d plane the geometric position and spatial topological information in the third dimension are lost zhang et al 2016 this method is relatively poor at analyzing the spatial characteristics and correlation of objects information cannot be reflected completely and objectively allen et al 2004 huang et al 2009 moreover this method is rather ineffective at coupling multi source heterogeneous data and facilitating a systematic analysis of existing problems as a result substantial amounts of data are unable to be effectively analyzed and utilized which is inappropriate to decision making needs in complex space he et al 2011 lai et al 2011 in addition owing to the size of model results and the complex structure of data required for analysis it is difficult to communicate between different fields zhang et al 2015 in recent years with the development of computer hardware and software 3d visualization technology has been applied in numerous fields brovelli and zamboni 2012 chen et al 2018 lee et al 2018 owing to its advantages in multidimensional space it provides an advanced tool and method for coupling and parsing multi source heterogeneous data liu et al 2018 trubka et al 2016 in the field of urban drainage research 3d visualization technology is at present predominantly used to show the distribution and attribute information of pipe networks he et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 and has yet to be combined with the urban drainage model the information provided for analysis and decision making remains limited and the capacity for data coupling and parsing are constrained breunig and zlatanova 2011 therefore it is necessary to study the ways in which 3d visualization technology can be successfully applied to couple with an urban drainage model this may help solve the above problems in the existing model of analysis process and provide effective decision support the objectives of this study were thus to i synchronously analyze time series data such as water level water quality flow direction and flow rate and the ground building information influenced by node flood in the form of 3d dynamic visualization ii synchronously compare and analyze different models in the form of 3d dynamic visualization iii provide a feasible theory and method to solve the problems of insufficient utilization of spatial information poor coupling and parsing capabilities of multi source heterogeneous data in the analysis process of urban drainage model to improve human computer interactions and to promote the development of visualization and analysis methods from 2d to the combination of 2d and 3d 2 methodology in this study the establishment of 3ddvm udm includes four parts 1 rapid construction of a 3d geographic environment 2 storage and coupling of multi source heterogeneous data 3 design of a 3d dynamic visualization method and 4 coupling urban drainage model with the 3d dynamic visualization method the framework of the methodology is shown in fig 1 2 1 rapid construction of the 3d geographic environment based on 3d gis technology the 3d geographic environment is primarily constructed by integrating remote sensing image data dem data 3d ground building models and 3d entity models of drainage pipe network it provides environment support for 3d dynamic visualization of urban drainage model results in this study the 3d geographic environment was constructed based on the unity3d engine platform remote sensing image data was superimposed on the dem data according to the consistency of geographical location to constructing the basic 3d environment as for the 3d building models on the ground this study mainly focused on the overall shape of buildings with fewer requirements for the appearance by extracting the building boundary and height from the remote sensing image data the 3d building models were constructed with a simple and rapid batch processing method according to the spatial and attribute data of the pipe network including the position size and height of nodes length diameter and burial depth of pipes the 3d entity models of the drainage pipe network were established by rapid batch and manual optimization methods 2 2 storage and coupling of multi source heterogeneous data multi source heterogeneous data can be divided into structured and unstructured data in the aspect of 3d dynamic visualization of drainage pipe network model structured data primarily include attribute data of pipe network and buildings model input data and simulation results unstructured data mainly include remote sensing image data dem data and pictures in this study for the storage and coupling of structured data the rational database was used database application contained data reading and writing operations which were used to store the attribute data of pipe network and buildings model input data and simulation results from external files or convert these stored data into the required format to use outside for the attribute data of the pipe network and buildings they can be read and written in the database with the query method after obtaining the ids of the corresponding objects as identifiers in 3d environment for the model input data they were stored in the database and utilized when the model input file was generated for the simulation results they were stored in the database as a single data table and correlated with each other according to the consistency of time information given that an object corresponds to a set of time series data the id of each object in the urban drainage system can be obtained under the 3d environment as an identifier to establish a connection between the object and the corresponding data in the database for unstructured data they were stored in file mode structured data and unstructured data were correlated by the identifier of object in the 3d environment 2 3 design of the 3d dynamic visualization method according to the characteristic of model results and the topological relationship between data in this study the corresponding 3d dynamic visualization method was designed 2 3 1 3d dynamic visualization of the single model scenario this primarily comprised the 3d dynamic visualization of model results of pipes and nodes as well as ground buildings influenced by flood water in this study for the 3d visualization of model results related to pipes and nodes the method of filling the 3d water object in the pipe network entity model was adopted as detailed below 2 3 1 1 pipe object this mainly included the 3d dynamic visualization of water level water quality flow rate and flow direction the 3d water object was filled in the pipe entity model and initially its id size and direction were the same as that of the pipe the water object of different types of pipes was visualized in different basic colors as the distinction the id of the water object was used as the identifier to get the corresponding model results by limiting the color rendering range of mesh vertices of water objects the water level data could be converted into the variation of water height in the pipes as shown in eqs 1 3 and fig 2 the color transition method was used to represent the variation in water quality in the pipes based on the basic color of the water object the water quality data was converted into the change of color shade of mesh vertices for the vertex in the x direction of the local coordinates of pipes where the position is greater than or equal to 0 1 y i y min h transparent color y i y min h basic color otherwise 2 y i y min h transparent color y i y min h basic color 3 h d m h r d where yi represents the vertex position of the water object in the y direction y min is the minimum value of the vertex position of the water object at x 0 y min is the minimum value of the vertex position of the water object at x 0 dm is the diameter of the 3d pipe entity model d is the actual diameter of the pipe h r is the simulated water level data in the model results h is the water height of the 3d pipe entity model the 3d dynamic visualization of pipe flow direction was represented by a 3d arrow of moderate size generated in each pipe in this study there were two coordinate systems including the global coordinate of the 3d environment and the local coordinate of the objects which were shown in fig 3 e since the positive direction of the local coordinate x of each pipe pointed to the positive direction of the global coordinate x and was parallel to the pipe slope we can generate a suitably sized arrow in each pipe and initially set the directions of each arrow as the same as that of the pipe thereby the direction of the local coordinate x of the arrow can be used to represent the positive or opposite flow direction furthermore the x direction of the local coordinate of the arrow should be rotated by 0 or 180 according to the position relationship between the start and end nodes in the x and z directions the position information of the start and end nodes was generally obtained from the model input file or the database through the identifier the relationship between the positions of the start and end nodes and the arrow direction was shown in eq 4 corresponding to fig 3 a fig d the 3d dynamic visualization of flow velocity was represented by changing the length and color of the arrow 4 x en x sn 0 z en z sn 0 0 0 0 x en x sn 0 z en z sn 0 180 0 0 x en x sn 0 z en z sn 0 0 0 0 x en x sn 0 z en z sn 0 180 0 0 where x en is the position of the end node in the x direction x sn is the position of the start node in the x direction z en is the position of the end node in the z direction z sn is the position of the start node in the z direction 2 3 1 2 node object this primarily included the 3d dynamic visualization of the water level and water quality akin to the pipes the 3d water object was filled in the node entity and assigned with the model results the water object of different types of nodes was visualized in different basic colors as the distinction according to the eqs 5 8 eq 8 was concluded by eqs 5 7 the water level data could be converted into the variation of water height in the nodes as shown in fig 4 the color transition method was also adopted to represent the variation in water quality in the nodes 5 h nm h nr h wm h wr 6 s y h wm s ymax h nm 7 s ymax h nm h wm 8 s y h nm h wm h nr h wr where h nm is the height of the 3d node entity model h nr is the actual height of the node h wm is the water level in the 3d node entity model h wr is the simulated water level of the node s ymax is the maximum proportion of the water object within the node h wm is the initial height of the water object within the node s y is the scale of the water object within the node 2 3 1 3 buildings influenced by flood water for the 3d dynamic visualization of ground buildings influenced by flood water it was necessary to detect whether the flood points were within the scope of buildings in real time when calculating potential areas of inundation the spatial distribution of the affected buildings was obtained by highlighting them 2 3 2 3d dynamic comparison of multi model scenarios for the comparison of multi model scenarios the data was coupled and the multi view mode was adopted to perform 3d dynamic comparisons either synchronously or asynchronously synchronous analysis meant that the perspective and position of multiple views changed at the same time and the data variation of each object under different scenarios could be compared under the same perspective asynchronous analysis indicated that the perspective changes of multiple views were in discordance when the mouse entered the field of view the view could be rotated and zoomed without affecting other fields of view 2 4 coupling urban drainage model with the 3d dynamic visualization method at present there are many drainage modelling tools including the storm water management model swmm infoworks cs and mike urban bisht et al 2016 van der sterren et al 2014 zhu et al 2016 they can be divided into commercial type and open source type commercial drainage models are costly and cannot be redeveloped the 3d dynamic visualization method can only be loosely coupled with these models through compiling the data interface program to retrieve results from the model for open source drainage models their source codes can be packaged and embedded into the 3d dynamic visualization method through referring to the calculation module and result reading module in the model the 3d dynamic visualization method can be tightly coupled with the urban drainage model given that swmm is a free and open source software it is suitable for the secondary development of integration with other algorithms and software tools riaño briceño et al 2016 wang et al 2017 in this study swmm was selected to be coupled with the 3d dynamic visualization method the source code of swmm was packaged into a dynamic link library dll file which was loaded into the unity3d engine for calling the swmm input file could be created to some extent by editing its different sections in the 3d environment the external input file could also be read by selecting an object from the urban drainage system its corresponding information in the input file was obtained and further modified and saved by calling the computing module of the dll file different model scenarios were simulated by calling the result module of the dll file and writing the data interface numerous time series data of pipes nodes and subcatchments were extracted and stored in the database the precipitation falls on the earth s surface and then enters the drainage network due to the limited capacity of the pipes water may flood out from the nodes however swmm is a 1d rainfall runoff model which is unable to simulate the above ground flood routing using the flood water from nodes wu et al 2017 although coupled 1d 2d models were already a well established approach to simulate urban flooding in this study with the consideration of computational power and time a simplified method established by the source flooding algorithm chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 and the seeded region growing algorithm noman et al 2001 shen et al 2015 was adopted to construct the 2d overland flow model with less consideration paid to the two way interaction between the sewer system and the flood water the implementation process of the 2d overland flow model was as follows firstly the flooded node was set as the initial seed point then taking the seed point as the center the elevation of the surrounding point was sought and obtained in eight directions according to the gravity characteristics of the water flow the elevation of the surrounding point was compared with the water level at the seed point separately buildings were also cross detected in real time if the elevation of the surrounding point was lower than the water level at the seed point and the surrounding point did not fall within the scope of the buildings the surrounding point would be used as a new seed point and marked as a flood area if the elevation of the surrounding point within the range of the building was less than the water level of the seed point the building would be marked as an influenced building this process was repeated until no flood water remained finally the time series information regarding the influenced buildings was obtained and stored in the database 3 application and results 3 1 study area chaohu city is situated in the center of anhui province in eastern china with a subtropical humid monsoon climate qi et al 2015 qin et al 2014 it is located in the northeast of the lower yangtze region near chaohu lake chen et al 2011 yu et al 2011 the case study area is the central part of chaohu city which covers an area of 27 65 km2 it is a predominantly residential area the urban drainage system is complex with both separate and combined sewage systems the map and the 3d environment of the study area are shown in fig 5 and fig 6 f in this study the resolution of the remote sensing image was 1 m 1m and the data source was google map image fig 6 a the resolution of dem data was also 1 m 1m which was generated from data with a resolution of 10 m 10 m using the kriging interpolation method mosammam 2013 fig 6 b according to the method in section 2 1 956 ground buildings were constructed in the study area as displayed in fig 6 d by generalizing the urban drainage system including 589 pipes 583 nodes and 53 outlets the 3d entity models were established fig 6 e the coordinate system of the remote sensing image the dem data the drainage pipe network and the building boundary were all wgs 1984 3 2 designing and coupling the urban drainage model using the method in section 2 4 the drainage model was optimized and closely coupled with the 3d dynamic visualization method as displayed in fig 7 in the 3d environment some operations can be conducted including creating the swmm input file to some extent reading and editing the external input file simulating extracting and storing simulation results in the study area the design formula of storm intensity is displayed in eq 9 xu 2011 9 q 21 557 16 383 l g p t 14 0 84 where q is the storm intensity mm min p is the design return periods year and t is the rainfall duration min the rainfall processes of the different rainstorm return periods were determined by the chicago hydrograph model closest to the actual conditions rainfall return periods of 1 year 3 years 5 years 10 years 50 years and 100 years were designed the rainfall durations were all two hours 3 3 3d dynamic visualization of the urban drainage model 3 3 1 3d visualization of pipe network objects the distribution of underground drainage system is intricate and complex in this study through fully utilizing the attribute data such as the size and depth of pipes and nodes the representation of the pipe network object was transformed from a 2d point line and number to 3d entity models fig 6 e the height variation slope hierarchical distribution and the connections of the pipe network in vertical space were presented with the function of roaming in 3d space the researchers and decision makers were able to freely roam both outside and inside the underground pipe network by querying the properties of each pipe network object the objects that met the necessary criteria could be obtained and displayed the 3d entity models of the pipe network objects were further integrated with the 3d geographic environment and the 3d building models by altering the terrain s transparency the 3d geographical environment in which the pipe network objects were located was obtained including land use type terrain elevation as well as the drainage pipe network information corresponding to the buildings fig 8 3 3 2 3d dynamic visualization of single rainfall event according to the method of section 2 3 1 multiple types of data including water level water quality flow direction and flow velocity were simultaneously and dynamically visualized in the 3d environment fig 9 a c in terms of water level the water level data were transformed to the height variation of the water object the researchers and decision makers were able to simultaneously and intuitively access the dynamic change processes of water level and fullness outside or inside the underground pipe network by combining the attribute data such as the size and buried depth of pipe network objects when the node flooded it would be highlighted fig 9 b a 3d spatial distribution map of flooded nodes and fully filled pipes could also be generated fig 10 in terms of water quality because different types of pipes were visualized in different basic colors and the water quality data was converted into the variation of the color shade of the water object the water quality differences of pipe network objects can be obtained quickly and intuitively meanwhile the information of water quality standards was coupled when the water quality of the pipe network object met prerequisite standards the object would be highlighted in the 3d environment a 3d spatial distribution map of nodes and pipes that met water quality standards could also be generated by coupling the data regarding water level water quality flow direction and flow rate their variations and mutual relationships could be obtained and analyzed simultaneously by selecting the pipe network object its identifier was obtained which retrieved the corresponding attribute information and simulation results stored in the database these data could be visualized in the form of a graph in the 3d space environment of the object fig 9 c on the basis of the above 3d dynamic visualization of model results the analysis reports were generated to provide data support for decision making these demonstrated whether or not pipes and nodes met water quality standards whether or not pipes were fully filled and whether or not nodes flooded the information was detailed including the name position and time series data of the corresponding object 3 3 3 3d dynamic visualization of ground buildings influenced by flood water due to the coupling of the ground 3d building model in the analysis process of drainage model the underground information and above ground information including the underground drainage pipe network simulation results ground buildings and dem data can be integrated for correlation analysis the water level and water quality changes of the corresponding pipes and nodes under each building were obtained intuitively fig 9 b as the node flooded the influenced buildings were highlighted in the 3d environment and the number was counted fig 9 d the 3d spatial distribution map of flooded nodes and influenced buildings under different rainfall return periods was also generated fig 11 the information regarding the influenced buildings including name location and time series data was also stored into external files to support decision making 3 3 4 3d dynamic visualization comparison of different rainfall events according to the method of section 2 3 2 the model results from two to six scenarios were coupled the 3d dynamic comparison analysis was performed in a multi view manner either synchronously or asynchronously here the comparison of model results under two different rainfall return periods including 1 year and 3 year periods is presented in the 3d environment the differences in water level fullness and water quality of the same pipe network objects were obtained intuitively for example for the pipe of number 1 in fig 10 a the pipe was not fully filled when the rain lasted for 50 min under the rainfall return period of 1 year however this pipe was fully filled under the rainfall return period of 3 years for the node of number 2 the water quality met the standard of level3 when the rain lasted for 50 min under the rainfall return period of 1 year under the rainfall return period of 3 years the water quality of this node did not meet this standard and the water level was higher than that of 1 year for the node of number 3 in fig 10 b under the rainfall return period of 1 year there was no flood at this node when the rain lasted for 68 min however flood occurred when the rainfall return period was 3 years at the same time according to the color shade of the water inside the node the water quality data of the rainfall return period of 1 year was higher than that of 3 years therefore the differences in pipes and nodes meeting the standards and the differences of multiple types of model results could be obtained and analyzed intuitively by selecting the pipe network object the corresponding attribute information and the model results under different rainfall return period could be obtained and displayed in the 3d environment meanwhile the distribution differences of flooded nodes and fully filled pipes under different rainfall events could be analyzed in a multi perspective way as shown in fig 11 in combination with the 3d ground building models the differences in water level and water quality of the nodes and pipes under each building as well as the spatial distributions of buildings influenced by flood water were obtained fig 11 at the same time statistical reports of the model results under different rainfall events were generated as displayed in table 1 these included the number of fully filled pipes the number of flooded nodes the number of buildings influenced and their respective percentages relative to the total number according to fig 11 and table 1 little difference exists between the proportion of fully filled pipes under different rainfall return periods in the study area however relative to the total number of pipes all proportions were large up to 50 percent their distributions were primarily concentrated in the central urban area and around the west huancheng river and tianhe river therefore the proportion and distribution range of the pipes that needed to be reconstructed were large which indicated high operating pressure of the pipe network in the study area the distribution of flooded nodes was also principally concentrated in the central urban area and around the east huancheng river west huancheng river and tianhe river as the rainfall return period increased the proportion gradually increased reaching a maximum of 21 44 this indicated that the condition of node flood was not optimistic aside from the rainfall events of 3 years and 5 years the proportions of flooded nodes between other rainfall return periods were significantly different the increased areas were mainly concentrated on the three main roads middle jiankang road chaohu road and renmin road the influenced buildings were primarily located on both sides of the roads in the central urban area as well as around the west huancheng river and tianhe river with an increased rainfall return period the influenced buildings gradually increased in number especially concentrated near renmin road and chaohu road given that the influenced buildings were mainly concentrated near the main roads of the city affecting traffic and residents lives mitigation strategies must be taken a video about section 3 2 and section 3 3 was supplied in the supplementary material 4 discussion 4 1 utilization of spatial information traditional expression methods of drainage pipe network objects in 2d are primarily point line and plane for example fig 12 a highlights the distribution of pipes and nodes at the intersection of renmin road and tuanjie road three types of pipes with complex distributions and mixed connection phenomena are apparent owing to the lack of effective use of spatial attribute information such as size and depth of pipes and nodes the traditional expression method is unable to show their height variations and hierarchical distribution relationships in 3d space the attribute information can only provide decision making support in the form of simple numbers changing with the spatial distribution although it can represent the mixed connection state it is not sufficiently specific to present the problem due to the dearth of 3d information it restricts researchers and decision makers intuitive knowledge and understanding of the research object which is not conducive to solving the problem besides the dem data can t be fully utilized to represent the 3d geographical environment of the study object through using the 3d visualization method the pipe network object is represented in 3d from 2d point 2d line and a large amount of numeric data for example fig 12 b is the result of the 3d transformation of fig 12 a in comparing fig 12 a with fig 12 b we can clearly recognize the advantage of the 3d visualization expression mode relative to the 2d plane mode in terms of the utilization of spatial information it is very effective for rapidly understanding the connectivity and size relationship of different pipes and nodes the variations of pipe slope the hierarchical distribution relationship as well as the problem of mixed connection can also be intuitively recognized in 3d space in a multi perspective way meanwhile the topographic data and the ground building information can be intuitively coupled as a result the utilization of spatial information becomes more complete the researchers and decision makers can have a systematic and intuitive understanding of the research object and the entire urban drainage model 4 2 coupling and parsing of multi source heterogeneous data 4 2 1 aspect of single scenario analysis existing analytical method of the urban drainage model primarily analyze the model results in 2d for example for the water level variation of nodes the analysis method is primarily in terms of the color change of the 2d point graph fig 13 a or variations in the node profile fig 13 b for the water level variation of pipes the analysis method is predominantly the color change of the 2d linear graph fig 13 a or variations in the pipe profile fig 13 b however for the data analysis method of color changes in 2d given that this is not highly correlated with the vertical attribute information and the characteristics of the study objects researchers and decision makers cannot attain an intuitive and rapid understanding of changes in the model s results and problems of the pipe network furthermore some optimization measures of the pipe network cannot be proposed systematically although the data analysis method of the profile can be combined with attribute data related to the results of the drainage system it is not highly integrated with the object environment where the data is located moreover connectivity between the selected start and end nodes needs to exist prior to profile analysis thus owing to the lack of systematic analysis of data in space this method is not able to significantly enhance researchers and decision makers understanding of data and improve communication between different fields in the analysis process of the flooded node the influence of ground buildings is a factor that cannot be ignored however the existing analytical method of the urban drainage model cannot intuitively couple the information of buildings such as the height data and obtain the changes in water level and water quality of nodes and pipes under buildings it is impossible to carry out specific analysis of influenced buildings in a multi perspective way in this study by adopting the 3ddvm udm diverse multi source heterogeneous data including remote sensing image data dem data 3d ground building models and the attribute data of pipe network were coupled therefore the above ground data and invisible underground data were visualized and analyzed in a natural and integrated way on this basis the drainage model results are further coupled and dynamically visualized and analyzed in the 3d space of the corresponding drainage pipe network objects for example by associating with the node height the water level data are transformed to the height variation of the water object within the node and pipe which corresponds with the variation pattern in the real environment as displayed in fig 13 d the buildings influenced by node flood are quickly identified and the corresponding attribute information is also obtained multiple types of model results are also analyzed simultaneously meanwhile since the drainage system is analyzed as a whole in 3d the relationship between the data of any pipe network object and other objects can be analyzed systematically and comprehensively there is no need to consider whether there is connectivity between the start node and the end node therefore when the drainage model is used for the optimization of a pipe network in comparison to the 2d data analysis method the 3ddvm udm can extract efficient information from large amounts of data and improve the efficiency of data analysis and decision making according to the correlations between multiple data some targeted prevention and protection measures can be proposed for improving the overflow and water quality conditions of the pipe network mitigating the influence of flooding on buildings or comprehensively considering multiple aims such as increasing the diameter of corresponding pipes changing the height of nodes and modifying the slope of pipes 4 2 2 aspect of scenario comparison the existing analysis methods of the urban drainage model primarily compare the simulation results from different scenarios by selecting typical objects and adopting the form of 2d charts these methods result in data lacking systematic and comprehensive analysis there are also a few methods to compare the simulation results of multiple scenarios in a multi view manner however it is difficult to achieve the desired comparative effect due to insufficient combination with study object and other multi source heterogeneous data as shown in fig 13 c in contrast by adopting the 3ddvm udm the model results under different rainfall return periods are systematically coupled the differences in water level and water quality of each pipe network object the buildings influenced by flood water as well as the water level and water quality of the corresponding pipe network objects under each building are analyzed intuitively and comprehensively in the overall analysis of the model results researchers and decision makers can directly access considerable comparative information in the object environment where the data is located fig 11 this information includes the differences in the satisfaction of different water quality standards for pipes and nodes during the whole rainfall process as well as the differences in the spatial distributions of flooded nodes fully filled pipes and buildings influenced by flood water therefore by using this method multiple types of information become more closely related the researchers and decision makers can analyze the operational conditions of a drainage system under different rainfall return periods systematically so as to make decisions based on more comprehensive and reliable information 4 3 improvement of human machine interaction in the process of drainage model analysis many complicated sources of information need to be considered currently researchers and decision makers cannot interact with the study object and conduct in depth analysis of data from multiple perspectives which is not conducive to the acquisition of data and exploration of potential information in this study by constructing the 3d environment the model results are directly and dynamically visualized in a way that is close to the change in objects in the real environment it enables researchers to roam in the study area the simulation results can be analyzed and explored in a multi perspective and interactive manner by rendering the presentation and analysis of data more realistic results are more likely to be accepted by those who have no technical background or who lack a profound understanding of a particular problem meanwhile it is also conducive to promoting communication between different fields thus this method can greatly improve the human machine interaction 4 4 applicability of the 3ddvm udm to other regions when the 3ddvm udm is applied to other regions we can first establish the corresponding 3d environment through the rapid construction method of 3d environment in section 2 1 the algorithm and code established in this study are generic they can be easily applied to the corresponding objects in the 3d environment of other regions some operations can be conducted including creating the swmm input file to some extent reading and editing the external input file simulating extracting and storing simulation results as well as 3d dynamic visualization analysis of data in comparison with other 3d visualization tools the development processes are relatively similar based on the existing models these tools are all developed by proposing and establishing some novel algorithms for coupling visualization and interaction of multi source heterogenous data the method proposed in this study mainly focuses on the research of 3d dynamic visualization of drainage pipe network model which supplements some existing researches such as the three dimensional dynamic visualization of flooding leskens et al 2017 and ground water tian et al 2016 4 5 future work when creating the input file of the swmm model in the 3d environment some parameters including manning coefficient and infiltration coefficient cannot be edited which needs to be improved in the future some experiments need to be conducted to validate the usefulness of this methodology by asking experts and practitioners to use it the accuracy of the overland flow model also needs to be tested by comparing with real flood data and other tools such as 2d shallow water models leandro and martins 2016 and other simplified flood spreading algorithms bermúdez et al 2018 chen et al 2009 given that the development platform used in this study is highly integrated with virtual reality vr technology this method can be further combined with vr technology in the future thus the management and decision making of urban drainage systems can be conducted in an immersive and in depth way in addition because monitoring data is the input condition of the model simulation we can combine this method with online monitoring technology of the pipe network in the future thus the urban drainage system can visualize the monitoring data of the 3d entities of the drainage pipe network dynamically and in real time and carry out real time simulation and 3d dynamic visualization of prediction results so as to provide better early warning information 5 conclusion given the deficiencies of the existing 2d analysis method for the urban drainage model a 3ddvm udm was established in this study by coupling the urban drainage model with 3d gis technology and 3d visualization technology the feasibility of this method is carried out using the example of chaohu city china a range of multi source heterogeneous data were integrated including remote sensing image data dem data ground building information and the attribute data of the urban drainage system on this basis the urban drainage model was further tightly coupled multiple types of model data including water level water quality flow velocity and flow direction were visualized in the 3d entity of the corresponding pipe and nodes simultaneously and dynamically in a way close to reality the ground buildings influenced by node flood were also visualized in the 3d environment by coupling comparing and analyzing the model data under different rainfall return periods substantial comparative information could be directly accessed in the 3d environment where the data were located this information included differences in the water level and water quality of each pipe and node during the entire rainfall process adherence to different water quality standards as well as the spatial distribution of flooded nodes fully filled pipes and buildings influenced by node flood based on the model results targeted pipe network reconstruction measures and preventive measures can thus be systematically proposed through intuitively combining with the multi source heterogeneous data related to data analysis the study results show that the 3ddvm udm can fully utilize the spatial information and solve the problem of using multi source heterogeneous data it is conducive to improving the human machine interaction enhancing communication between different fields and assisting in environmental management and decision making support this study provides a feasible theory and method for promoting a shift in analysis and visualization from 2d into the combination of 2d and 3d declaration of competing

6247,empirical relationships linking kinetic energy to rainfall intensity are commonly used to estimate rainfall erosivity in this paper using the drop size distribution dsd proposed by marshall and palmer a relationship for calculating the rainfall kinetic power was firstly deduced this equation requires the simultaneous measurement of both the median volume diameter and the rainfall intensity and its application also reveals the drawback of needing the measurement of the whole dsd by an expensive disdrometric technique then using a fictitious precipitation which is both constituted by droplets having the same diameter mean volume diameter and having the same volume of the actual rainfall a new expression of the rainfall kinetic power was deduced this last equation has the advantage of allowing the estimate of the rainfall kinetic power by using the measurements of both rainfall intensity and the total number of droplets reaching a horizontal unit area in an unit time which can be acquired by a cheap device using a piezoelectric force transducer this new relationship for estimating the rainfall kinetic power was tested using disdrometric measurements carried out at two experimental sites in italy palermo and in spain el teularet these experimental tests demonstrated that the rainfall kinetic power estimated by the mean volume diameter has an accuracy similar to the literature relationships proposed by wischmeier and smith brown and foster and mcgregor et al finally this investigation also showed that this novel approach can be applied estimating the median

deforestation are well known and annual soil loss from arable lands worldwide is estimated equal to a financial loss of 400 billion per year borrelli et al 2017 rainfall soil erosion is a process of both detachment of individual soil particles and their transport due to the erosive agents rainfall erosivity which is the capability of the rainfall to erode soil is a major driving force of many hydrological and erosion processes mannaerts and gabriels 2000 during raindrop impact soil aggregates breakdown and produce finer easily transportable primary particles and micro aggregates di stefano and ferro 2002 these particles and micro aggregates affect the processes of infiltration seal and crust development runoff and soil erosion feng ling et al 2008 interrill erosion which is a component of the erosive process is controlled by soil detachment and transport capacity due to rainfall and overland flow ferro 1998 taking into account that the soil detachability of overland flow is negligible since the flow shear stresses are generally low rainfall impact is the main process affecting soil detachment in interrill soil erosion rainfall erosivity can be represented by its kinetic energy per unit time and area named kinetic power pn j m 2 s 1 carollo and ferro 2015 in the past many empirical relationships linking kinetic power to rainfall intensity i mm h 1 having different mathematical forms salles et al 2002 were proposed for measuring kinetic power scientists designed high sensitivity recorders and high precision instruments able to give a continuous record of the rainfall drop size distribution such devices as the raindrop spectrometer mason and ramanadham 1953 the photoelectric raindrop size spectrometer dingle and hardy 1962 the optical disdrometer grossklaus et al 1998 the joss waldvogel rainfall disdrometer kinnell 1976 are expensive structurally complex and cumbersome for routine use some researchers proposed the application of the acoustic method based on the conversion into an electrical pulse of the sound made by the drop upon impact on the diaphragm of a microphone kinnell 1973 which has practical limitations due to the duration of the decaying waveform the pulses produced by successive impacts of raindrops tend to interfere with each other and the device can reliably work only at low rainfall intensity jayawardena and rezaur 2000 introduced a new measurement technique using a piezoelectric transducer able to continuously and automatically record on a time scale the amplitude of electrical pulses produced by the impact of raindrops on the surface of the transducer the size distribution of the raindrops and their respective kinetic power are calculated by analyzing the stored voltage pulses in particular each pulse represents a drop and the magnitude of the pulse corresponds to the drop size and its kinetic power the authors suggest also that a power relationship can be established between transducer peak output voltage and kinetic power a piezoelectric force transducer is a cheap device useful to measure the total number of droplets which reach a horizontal unit area in an unit time and the variability of drop diameters hitting the piezoelectric surface can be obtained by analyzing the electrical pulses produced by the impact of raindrops in this paper considering the gamma distribution proposed by ulbrich 1983 a relationship for calculating the rainfall kinetic power is firstly deduced this theoretical equation requires the simultaneous measurement of both the median volume diameter and the rainfall intensity then a new expression of the rainfall kinetic power is deduced using the mean volume diameter as representative of the whole drop size distribution dsd this last diameter can be simply calculated using the measurements of both rainfall intensity and the total number of droplets which reach a horizontal unit area in an unit time acquired by a cheap device that uses a piezoelectric force transducer these new relationships for calculating the rainfall kinetic power are tested using disdrometric measurements carried out at two experimental sites in italy palermo and in spain el teularet 2 empirical models used to estimate the kinetic power the most commonly used relationship for estimating the kinetic power per unit volume of rainfall pn i j m 2 mm 1 as function of rainfall intensity is that proposed by wischmeier and smith 1978 and used in the universal soil loss equation usle 1 p n i 11 9 8 73 log i eq 1 can be applied for rainfall intensity values i it being it the intensity threshold value which wischmeier and smith 1978 set equal to 76 mm h 1 wischmeier and smith 1978 also state that for i it the ratio pn i j m 2 mm 1 assumes a constant value calculated by eq 1 for i 76 mm h 1 which is equal to 28 3 j m 2 mm 1 in other words the ratio pn i increases for rainfall intensity value less than or equal to it and it becomes constant for rainfall intensity greater than it wischmeier and smith 1978 justify this threshold value suggesting that the median volume diameter d0 which is the diameter that divides the rain drop size distribution dsd in two parts of equal volume stops to continue to increase when rainfall intensities exceed 76 mm h 1 for describing the same trend kinnell 1981 proposes the following relationship 2 p n i a 1 b e x p c i where a b and c are parameters according to eq 2 pn i has a finite positive value at zero intensity and approaches to the asymptotic value a at high intensity values kinnell 1987 states that a parameter can be assumed equal to 29 j m 2 mm 1 while b and c parameters are site specific salles et al 2002 as suggested by brown and foster 1987 eq 2 is used in the rusle model with a 29 j m 2 mm 1 b 0 72 and c 0 05 h mm 1 this choice allows to obtain an asymptotic value of pn i which is near to the value obtained by eq 1 for i 76 mm h 1 pn i 28 3 j m 2 mm 1 in the rusle2 model foster 2004 suggests to estimate pn i by eq 2 with parameter values proposed by mcgregor et al 1995 i e a 29 j m 2 mm 1 b 0 72 and c 0 082 h mm 1 salles et al 2002 carrying out an overview of many empirical relationships pn i concluded that for a fixed rainfall intensity these relationships yield to very different values of kinetic power in agreement with parsons and gadian 2000 salles et al 2002 also stated that a global parameter as rainfall intensity should not be sufficient to estimate the rainfall erosivity because of the dependence of the kinetic power measurements on other specific parameters such as rain type altitude climate and method of measurement 3 theoretical relationship between rainfall kinetic power and median volume diameter kinetic power can be directly calculated by adding the contribution of single raindrops using information on the measured dsd and the terminal velocity v m s 1 of a drop having a diameter d cm in other words this approach allows an indirect measurement of the rainfall erosivity if each drop diameter of the measured dsd is coupled with the relationship terminal velocity drop diameter using the measurements of raindrop terminal velocity v m s 1 obtained by many researchers laws 1941 gunn and kinzer 1949 blanchard 1967 beard 1976 epema and riezebos 1983 jayawardena and rezaur 2000 ferro 2001 proposed the following relationship 3 v 9 5 1 exp 6 d according to which v depends only on d expressed as cm the raindrop size distribution is defined as the function stating the expected number of drops with diameter between d and d dd the study of the dsd formation and evolution allowed to distinguish two different raindrop size distributions referred to unitary volume of air or to unit area and time serio et al 2019 in hydrological studies the dsd commonly refers to the number of droplet n d dd having a diameter between d and d dd that reach a horizontal unit area in an unit of time uijlenhoet and stricker 1999 one of the most applied distributions used to characterize the dsd in different climatic environments is the gamma distribution proposed by ulbrich 1983 which represents a generalization of the marshall and palmer 1948 distribution 4 n d d d n o d μ e x p λ d d d in which no μ and λ are the three parameters of the distribution the kinetic power pn j m 2 s 1 knowing both dsd and terminal velocity has to be calculated as salles et al 2002 5 p n 10 6 ρ π 12 0 v 2 d d 3 n d d d carollo and ferro 2015 using eqs 3 4 and 5 deduced theoretically the following expression of the kinetic power 6 p n 10 6 9 5 2 7 2 ρ 1 2 6 λ 1 4 μ 1 12 λ 1 4 μ i where ρ is water density kg m 3 eq 6 allows an indirect measurement of the ratio pn i if the dsd of a given rainfall intensity is measured and its parameters μ and λ are estimated carollo et al 2017 according to eq 6 the ratio pn i only depends on the intrinsic characteristics of rainfall affecting the two parameters of ulbrich s dsd taking into account that the median volume diameter cm do of the ulbrich s distribution i e the drop diameter that divides the dsd into two parts of equal volume can be calculated by the following relationship ulbrich 1983 7 d o 3 67 μ λ eq 6 can be rewritten as follows 8 p n 10 6 9 5 2 7 2 ρ 1 2 6 d o 3 67 μ 1 4 μ 1 12 d o 3 67 μ 1 4 μ i therefore for a given μ value if the median volume diameter do is measured then eq 8 could be applied for carrying out an indirect measurement of the ratio pn i by the median volume diameter do uijlenhoet and stricker 1999 demonstrated that the exponential distribution of marshall and palmer 1948 when represents the number of raindrops with diameter between d and d dd arriving at a surface per unit area and per unit time can be assumed formally identical to the gamma distribution ulbrich 1983 characterized by μ 0 67 carollo et al 2016 as a consequence from eq 8 the following theoretical relationship is deduced 9 p n 10 6 9 5 2 7 2 ρ 1 2 6 d o 4 34 1 4 67 1 12 d o 4 34 1 4 67 i which expresses that the ratio pn i as a function only on the median volume diameter of the distribution when the rainfall intensity i exceeds a threshold value d0 assumes a constant value and according to eq 9 the ratio pn i becomes constant in other words eq 9 represents a theoretical confirmation of the wischmeier and smith 1978 hypothesis in fact for it 76 mm h pn i is equal to 28 3 j m 2 mm 1 because d0 assumes a constant value too carollo et al 2016 using dsd measurements carried out with different techniques and in different geographical sites carollo et al 2017 highlighted that the measured pairs pn i and do i are site specific and or depend on the applied measurement technique these measurements suggested also that the relationship between pn i and d0 is not site dependent and can be represented by eq 9 in other words eq 9 theoretically deduced is reliable to represent the erosive power of the precipitation everywhere these results allowed to state that d0 is the diameter useful to characterize the rainfall impact on soil surface from an energetic point of view carollo et al 2018 for a given rainfall intensity the practical application of eq 9 for calculating the rainfall kinetic power pn requires the knowledge of the whole dsd which is represented by do therefore from a practical point of view the application of eq 9 becomes attractive only if the median volume diameter can be directly measured or estimated by other information which does not require the knowledge of the whole rainfall dsd 4 theoretical relationship between rainfall kinetic power and mean volume diameter if a drop size distribution of a real rainfall is replaced with a simplified one which is constituted by all droplets having the same size equal to the mean volume diameter of the distribution dm cm and the two distributions real and simplified have also the same rainfall volume the following relationship can be written 10 n π 6 d m 3 i 1 n π 6 d i 3 in which n m 2 s 1 is the total number of droplets per unit area and unit of time of the dsd from eq 10 the diameter dm is calculated by the following relationship 11 d m i 1 n d i 3 n 3 taking into account the definition of simplified dsd eq 10 the following expression of the rainfall intensity is also obtained 12 i n π 6 d m 3 therefore from eq 12 the mean volume diameter is obtained as follows 13 d m i n π 6 3 from a practical point of view this equation implies that the mean volume diameter dm can be calculated using the conventional rainfall intensity measurement and counting the total number of droplets which can be acquired by a cheap device that uses a piezoelectric force transducer jayawardena and rezaur 2000 from a theoretical point of view considering the distribution proposed by ulbrich 1983 the rainfall intensity i m s 1 can be calculated by the following expression salles et al 2002 14 i π 6 0 d 3 n d d d π 6 n o 0 d 3 μ e x p λ d d d taking into account that olver 1997 15 0 d 3 μ e x p λ d d d γ 4 μ λ 4 μ where γ is the gamma function eq 14 reduces to 16 i π 6 n 0 γ 4 μ λ 4 μ according to eq 16 the rainfall intensity is a function of no μ and λ parameters of the ulbrich s distribution the total number of droplets n m 2 s 1 which reach a horizontal unit area in an unit time can be obtained integrating eq 4 17 n n o 0 d μ e x p λ d d d n o λ μ 1 γ μ 1 rearranging eq 13 using eqs 16 and 17 the following expression of the mean volume diameter dm is deduced 18 d m i n π 6 3 π 6 n 0 γ μ 4 λ 4 μ n o λ μ 1 γ μ 1 π 6 3 1 λ 3 γ μ 4 γ μ 1 3 1 λ γ μ 4 γ μ 1 3 according to which dm is function of μ and λ parameters of ulbrich distribution taking into account that 19 γ μ 1 μ γ μ eq 18 can be rearranged as follows 20 d m 1 λ μ 3 μ 2 μ 1 3 combining eqs 7 and 20 the following relationship is obtained 21 d o d m k d 3 67 μ μ 3 μ 2 μ 1 3 the ratio kd between the median volume diameter do and the mean volume diameter dm of the distribution is only a function of μ parameter the values of the ratio kd calculated by eq 21 are plotted versus μ parameter in fig 1 for the marshall and palmer distribution μ 0 67 kd is equal to 1 709 when μ varies from 0 to 4 kd ranges from 2 02 to 1 29 fig 1 combining eq 21 and eq 8 the rainfall kinetic power can be estimated as follows 22 p n 10 6 9 5 2 7 2 ρ 1 2 6 k d d m 3 67 μ 1 4 μ 1 12 k d d m 3 67 μ 1 4 μ i considering the marshall and palmer distribution per unit time and area with μ 0 67 kd is equal to 1 709 therefore eq 22 gives 23 p n 10 6 9 5 2 7 2 ρ 1 2 2 36 d m 1 4 67 1 4 72 d m 1 4 67 i eq 23 theoretically deduced highlights that the rainfall kinetic power depends on the mean volume diameter of the distribution and rainfall intensity in other words if the marshall and palmer distribution per unit area and time is reliable to describe the dsd the measurement of the mean volume diameter dm and of the rainfall intensity i would allow us to have an indirect measurement of the kinetic power of the precipitation 5 disdrometric measurements for testing the proposed method for indirectly measuring rainfall kinetic power the dsds detected using the same optical disdrometer model odm 70 made by eigenbrodt installed in two experimental sites located at palermo south italy and el teularet spain fig 2 were used the palermo experimental station is located at the department of agricultural food and forest sciences of the university of palermo at 40 a s l the el teularet experimental site is located at sierra de enguera at 100 km southwest from valencia at 760 m a s l for each raining minute the disdrometer measures drop diameter in the range 0 05 0 6 cm each drop is separately measured and registered into classes of about 0 005 cm width the disdrometer divides diameter range into 128 classes and gives the number of drops belonging to a particular class for each recording minute drop diameter is measured registering light damping due to the passage of the drop in the control volume between two diodes this volume has cylindrical shape with a length of 12 cm and a diameter of 2 2 cm disdrometer measures simultaneously diameter and falling velocity of the drops that pass through the control volume grossklaus et al 1998 carollo and ferro 2015 the disdrometer registered 544 rainfall events in the period june 2006 april 2014 at palermo experimental site and 79 events at el teularet experimental site in the period july 2015 may 2016 for each rainfall event only the dsds corresponding to rainfall intensity greater than 0 5 mm h and for which measured diameter classes were at least 20 were considered this choice allowed to exclude both rainfall having a low erosive power and dsds having a small sample size carollo and ferro 2015 carollo et al 2016a this procedure provided 45 802 one minute dsds for palermo and 5537 dsds for el teularet carollo et al 2018 named single dsds characterized by i determined by eq 14 that varied in the range 0 5 203 mm h 1 and 0 7 289 mm h 1 respectively for detecting the reliability of the eqs 1 2 9 and 23 the calculated values of the rainfall kinetic power pn c were a compared with those pn m obtained applying eq 3 to the dsd data measured by the disdrometer this comparison was carried out using as statistical index i the mean absolute error mae expressed as percentage 24 mae 100 n dsd i 1 n dsd p n c i p n m i p n m i ii the mean square error mse 25 m s e i 1 n dsd p n m i p n c i 2 n dsd in which ndsd is the number of measured dsd pn ci and pn mi are respectively the calculated and measured rainfall kinetic power of a single dsd iii the bias expressed as percentage 26 bias 100 n dsd i 1 n dsd p n c i p n m i p n m i and iv the percentage f20 of calculated rainfall kinetic power values having an error greater than 20 6 testing the reliability of available relationships for calculating rainfall kinetic power figs 3 and 4 respectively for palermo and el teularet sites show the comparison between measured kinetic power pn m and those calculated pn c by eqs 1 ws and 2 with the parameters estimated by both brown and foster bf and mcgregor et al mg figs 3 and 4 demonstrate that eqs 1 and 2 have a comparable overall agreement with the measured kinetic power values these equations also tend to overestimate and underestimate the highest kinetic power values pn m 1 j m 2 s 1 at palermo and el teularet sites respectively for testing the reliability of eqs 9 and 23 the μ parameter was estimated using the maximum likelihood method fig 5 shows the μ parameter versus rainfall intensity for palermo fig 5a and el teularet fig 5b datasets in the same figure the line representing the moving average calculated using samples having a size of 20 data is also plotted in particular fig 5 highlights that beyond a starting decreasing trend with i for values of the rainfall intensity i 50 60 mm h 1 the μ parameter assumes a quasi constant value which is close to 0 67 for palermo while is slightly greater than 0 67 for el teularet data set this result demonstrates that marshall and palmer distribution can be applied to palermo data set for rainfall intensity values 50 60 mm h 1 fig 6 shows a comparison between measured kinetic power values pn m and those calculated pn c by eqs 9 and 23 for each site table 1 shows goodness of fit statistics of these applied relationships table 1 and fig 6 demonstrate that eq 9 which requires the measurement of do had the best performance for estimating kinetic power with mae of 5 7 and 9 7 and a bias of 2 and 0 1 in palermo and el teularet respectively in other words eq 9 with the measured do values is characterized by the minimum value of mae and can be considered unbiased this result yields to conclude that the median volume diameter allows to accurately characterize precipitation from the erosive point of view from an applicative point of view eq 9 has the inconvenience of requiring the knowledge of the whole dsd if a direct measurement technique of do is not available for both sites the goodness of fit statistics also demonstrate that estimate accuracy of the rainfall kinetic power by eq 23 is comparable with that of eqs 1 and 2 using the parameters estimated by brown and foster 1987 and mcgregor et al 1995 however eqs 1 and 2 are empirical relationships whose reliability should be tested by measurements carried out in the investigated area eq 23 being a theoretically deduced equation does not require reliability tests in addition even if in this investigation dm was obtained directly from the measured dsd eq 23 can be applied without measuring the whole dsd as dm can be calculated by eq 13 and carrying out the direct measurement of both rainfall intensity i and the total number of droplets n this information i n can be acquired by a cheap device that uses a piezoelectric force transducer jayawardena and rezaur 2000 fig 7 shows the pairs do dm of dsd measured in both experimental sites the low correlation of the mean volume diameter dm with the median volume diameter do values highlights that for a fixed dm value dsds having different values of the median volume diameter can occur fig 8 shows as an example two distributions having the same rainfall volume dm is constant which are characterized by both different shape and corresponding do values in other words two raindrop size distributions having the same volume can have different do values due to a different dsd shape according to eq 21 two raindrop size distributions having the same dm can have a different kd value which only depends on the shape parameter μ serio et al 2019 of the ulbrich s distribution these results suggest that the mean volume diameter dm is a scale parameter since this diameter establishes a simple similarity relationship between the true dsd and the simplified one having the same total rainfall volume the mean volume diameter dm is not able to take into account that the same rainfall volume can be attributed to rainfalls having a different dsd shape on the contrary the characteristic diameter do is able to take into account the scale and the shape of the dsd the median volume diameter do was thus correlated with dm scale parameter and the standard deviation of the diameters shape parameter σ d according to the following equation 27 d 0 α d m β σ d γ where α β and γ are site specific coefficients in particular for palermo α 0 32 β 0 007 γ 0 82 and for el teularet α 0 23 β 0 20 and γ 1 02 for both sites fig 9 shows the comparison between measured kinetic power values and those calculated by eqs 9 with do estimated by eq 27 for pn 0 5 j m 2 s 1 the use of the eq 9 with the median volume diameter estimated by eq 27 yields to have a systematic underestimation of the measured rainfall kinetic power producing a mean absolute error of pn of 6 6 and 13 for palermo and el teluaret respectively table 1 if the whole range of pn values is considered table 1 shows that a slightly positive bias 2 3 and 3 5 for palermo and el teluaret respectively occurs however only 2 2 for palermo and 20 for el teularet of measurements present an error 20 table 1 for pn 0 5 j m 2 s 1 corresponding to precipitation characterized by rainfall intensity 40 mm h 1 the systematic underestimation of the rainfall kinetic power by eq 9 is due to the circumstance that eq 27 tends to underestimate the do values for i 40 mm h 1 fig 10 the goodness of fit statistics listed in table 1 also shows that the results obtained by eq 9 with do estimated by eq 27 are intermediate between the worst scenario represented by eqs 1 2 23 and the best scenario corresponding to eq 9 with the measured do values for explaining this systematic underestimation of the rainfall kinetic power by eq 9 coupled with eq 27 the d0 i relationship can be also studied fig 11 shows the pairs i d0 distinguished for the ranges pn 0 5 j m 2 s 1 and for pn 0 5 j m 2 s 1 measured at palermo a and el teularet b the measurements highlight that for pn 0 5 j m 2 s 1 corresponding to precipitation characterized by rainfall intensity 40 mm h 1 the median volume diameter has an increasing trend with i for pn 0 5 j m 2 s 1 corresponding to rainfall with i 40 mm h 1 the median volume diameter do does not depend on rainfall intensity and assumes a constant value equal to 0 27 cm for palermo and 0 30 cm for el teularet this last result do is constant for i 40 mm h 1 and pn 0 5 j m 2 s 1 justifies that the use of eq 9 with do values estimated by eq 27 for precipitations characterized by i 40 mm h 1 provides a systematic underestimation of the kinetic power table 2 the estimate of the rainfall kinetic power by eq 9 for i 40 mm h 1 using a constant value of do equal to the mean value 0 27 or 0 30 cm is shown in fig 12 in this case eq 9 with a constant value of do for pn 0 5 j m 2 s 1 gives a reliable kinetic power estimate which is characterized by a mean percentage error μ e 3 7 and 4 3 for palermo and el teularet dataset respectively table 2 fig 11 in conclusion for both examined datasets the developed analysis highlighted that i the best estimate of pn is obtained by the theoretically deduced eq 9 whose practical attractiveness depends on a reliable estimate of the median volume diameter without requiring the knowledge of the whole dsd ii the accuracy of the theoretically deduced eq 23 is comparable with that obtained by available relationships wischmeier and smith brown and foster and mcgregor et al eq 23 requires the mean volume diameter dm which can be calculated using the conventional rainfall intensity measurement and counting the total number of droplets which can be acquired by a cheap device that uses a piezoelectric force transducer iii eq 9 coupled with do estimated by eq 27 yields pn estimates which are more accurate that those obtained by eqs 1 and 2 even if a systematic underestimation of pn can be observed for pn 0 5 j m 2 s 1 iv for pn 0 5 j m 2 s 1 corresponding to i 40 mm h 1 the median volume diameter does not depend on rainfall intensity and assumes a constant value v eq 9 coupled with a constant value of do gives a reliable kinetic power estimates for pn 0 5 j m 2 s 1 vi using eq 9 for pn 0 5 j m 2 s 1 the kinetic power is function of do and i instead for pn 0 5 j m 2 s 1 the kinetic power is proportional to rainfall intensity since do assumes a constant value 7 conclusions understanding rainfall characteristics such as drop size distribution dsd intensity and kinetic power allows to establish an indicator of rainfall erosivity useful for the prediction of soil erosion in this paper using a simplified rainfall which is constituted by all droplets having the same diameter mean volume diameter and having the same volume of the real rainfall a new expression of the rainfall kinetic power was firstly theoretically deduced for the marshall and palmer distribution referred to unit area and time the analysis showed that the rainfall kinetic power can be estimated by the contemporaneous measurement of both the mean volume diameter and the rainfall intensity in particular we propose that the mean volume diameter dm can be calculated using the conventional rainfall intensity measurement and counting the total number of droplets which can be acquired by a cheap device that uses a piezoelectric force transducer the analysis also showed that the theoretically deduced eq 9 has the best performance in estimating the kinetic power the measured kinetic power values allow also to conclude that the theoretically deduced relationship pn i dm eq 23 has an accuracy similar to the literature relationships taking into account that the median diameter is able to represent both the scale and the shape of the dsd for both datasets the median volume diameter resulted related to the mean volume diameter and the standard deviation of the raindrop diameters this circumstance also justifies the best performance of eq 9 with respect to eq 23 in estimating the rainfall kinetic power the analysis also established that eq 9 with do estimated by eq 27 yields pn estimates which are more accurate that those obtained by eqs 1 and 2 even if a systematic underestimation of pn can be observed for pn 0 5 j m 2 s 1 for i 40 mm h 1 the estimate of pn by eq 9 was improved using a median volume diameter independent of rainfall intensity and assuming a constant value for each site in other words using eq 9 for pn 0 5 j m 2 s 1 resulted a kinetic power which depends on d0 and i while for pn 0 5 j m 2 s 1 the kinetic power is simply proportional to rainfall intensity the obtained results require to be validated in wide range of sites with contrasting climatology and should be also tested using measurement methods that only inform on the number of drops and rainfall intensity further research should be directed towards the development of measurement techniques able to provide simple and accurate values of the mean volume diameter and the standard deviation of the raindrop size distribution declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements all authors set up the research analyzed and interpreted the results and contributed to write the

6247,empirical relationships linking kinetic energy to rainfall intensity are commonly used to estimate rainfall erosivity in this paper using the drop size distribution dsd proposed by marshall and palmer a relationship for calculating the rainfall kinetic power was firstly deduced this equation requires the simultaneous measurement of both the median volume diameter and the rainfall intensity and its application also reveals the drawback of needing the measurement of the whole dsd by an expensive disdrometric technique then using a fictitious precipitation which is both constituted by droplets having the same diameter mean volume diameter and having the same volume of the actual rainfall a new expression of the rainfall kinetic power was deduced this last equation has the advantage of allowing the estimate of the rainfall kinetic power by using the measurements of both rainfall intensity and the total number of droplets reaching a horizontal unit area in an unit time which can be acquired by a cheap device using a piezoelectric force transducer this new relationship for estimating the rainfall kinetic power was tested using disdrometric measurements carried out at two experimental sites in italy palermo and in spain el teularet these experimental tests demonstrated that the rainfall kinetic power estimated by the mean volume diameter has an accuracy similar to the literature relationships proposed by wischmeier and smith brown and foster and mcgregor et al finally this investigation also showed that this novel approach can be applied estimating the median volume diameter by the mean volume diameter and the standard deviation of the measured drop diameters whose measurement can be obtained by a force transducer keywords rainfall kinetic energy rainfall

mathematical forms salles et al 2002 were proposed for measuring kinetic power scientists designed high sensitivity recorders and high precision instruments able to give a continuous record of the rainfall drop size distribution such devices as the raindrop spectrometer mason and ramanadham 1953 the photoelectric raindrop size spectrometer dingle and hardy 1962 the optical disdrometer grossklaus et al 1998 the joss waldvogel rainfall disdrometer kinnell 1976 are expensive structurally complex and cumbersome for routine use some researchers proposed the application of the acoustic method based on the conversion into an electrical pulse of the sound made by the drop upon impact on the diaphragm of a microphone kinnell 1973 which has practical limitations due to the duration of the decaying waveform the pulses produced by successive impacts of raindrops tend to interfere with each other and the device can reliably work only at low rainfall intensity jayawardena and rezaur 2000 introduced a new measurement technique using a piezoelectric transducer able to continuously and automatically record on a time scale the amplitude of electrical pulses produced by the impact of raindrops on the surface of the transducer the size distribution of the raindrops and their respective kinetic power are calculated by analyzing the stored voltage pulses in particular each pulse represents a drop and the magnitude of the pulse corresponds to the drop size and its kinetic power the authors suggest also that a power relationship can be established between transducer peak output voltage and kinetic power a piezoelectric force transducer is a cheap device useful to measure the total number of droplets which reach a horizontal unit area in an unit time and the variability of drop diameters hitting the piezoelectric surface can be obtained by analyzing the electrical pulses produced by the impact of raindrops in this paper considering the gamma distribution proposed by ulbrich 1983 a relationship for calculating the rainfall kinetic power is firstly deduced this theoretical equation requires the simultaneous measurement of both the median volume diameter and the rainfall intensity then a new expression of the rainfall kinetic power is deduced using the mean volume diameter as representative of the whole drop size distribution dsd this last diameter can be simply calculated using the measurements of both rainfall intensity and the total number of droplets which reach a horizontal unit area in an unit time acquired by a cheap device that uses a piezoelectric force transducer these new relationships for calculating the rainfall kinetic power are tested using disdrometric measurements carried out at two experimental sites in italy palermo and in spain el teularet 2 empirical models used to estimate the kinetic power the most commonly used relationship for estimating the kinetic power per unit volume of rainfall pn i j m 2 mm 1 as function of rainfall intensity is that proposed by wischmeier and smith 1978 and used in the universal soil loss equation usle 1 p n i 11 9 8 73 log i eq 1 can be applied for rainfall intensity values i it being it the intensity threshold value which wischmeier and smith 1978 set equal to 76 mm h 1 wischmeier and smith 1978 also state that for i it the ratio pn i j m 2 mm 1 assumes a constant value calculated by eq 1 for i 76 mm h 1 which is equal to 28 3 j m 2 mm 1 in other words the ratio pn i increases for rainfall intensity value less than or equal to it and it becomes constant for rainfall intensity greater than it wischmeier and smith 1978 justify this threshold value suggesting that the median volume diameter d0 which is the diameter that divides the rain drop size distribution dsd in two parts of equal volume stops to continue to increase when rainfall intensities exceed 76 mm h 1 for describing the same trend kinnell 1981 proposes the following relationship 2 p n i a 1 b e x p c i where a b and c are parameters according to eq 2 pn i has a finite positive value at zero intensity and approaches to the asymptotic value a at high intensity values kinnell 1987 states that a parameter can be assumed equal to 29 j m 2 mm 1 while b and c parameters are site specific salles et al 2002 as suggested by brown and foster 1987 eq 2 is used in the rusle model with a 29 j m 2 mm 1 b 0 72 and c 0 05 h mm 1 this choice allows to obtain an asymptotic value of pn i which is near to the value obtained by eq 1 for i 76 mm h 1 pn i 28 3 j m 2 mm 1 in the rusle2 model foster 2004 suggests to estimate pn i by eq 2 with parameter values proposed by mcgregor et al 1995 i e a 29 j m 2 mm 1 b 0 72 and c 0 082 h mm 1 salles et al 2002 carrying out an overview of many empirical relationships pn i concluded that for a fixed rainfall intensity these relationships yield to very different values of kinetic power in agreement with parsons and gadian 2000 salles et al 2002 also stated that a global parameter as rainfall intensity should not be sufficient to estimate the rainfall erosivity because of the dependence of the kinetic power measurements on other specific parameters such as rain type altitude climate and method of measurement 3 theoretical relationship between rainfall kinetic power and median volume diameter kinetic power can be directly calculated by adding the contribution of single raindrops using information on the measured dsd and the terminal velocity v m s 1 of a drop having a diameter d cm in other words this approach allows an indirect measurement of the rainfall erosivity if each drop diameter of the measured dsd is coupled with the relationship terminal velocity drop diameter using the measurements of raindrop terminal velocity v m s 1 obtained by many researchers laws 1941 gunn and kinzer 1949 blanchard 1967 beard 1976 epema and riezebos 1983 jayawardena and rezaur 2000 ferro 2001 proposed the following relationship 3 v 9 5 1 exp 6 d according to which v depends only on d expressed as cm the raindrop size distribution is defined as the function stating the expected number of drops with diameter between d and d dd the study of the dsd formation and evolution allowed to distinguish two different raindrop size distributions referred to unitary volume of air or to unit area and time serio et al 2019 in hydrological studies the dsd commonly refers to the number of droplet n d dd having a diameter between d and d dd that reach a horizontal unit area in an unit of time uijlenhoet and stricker 1999 one of the most applied distributions used to characterize the dsd in different climatic environments is the gamma distribution proposed by ulbrich 1983 which represents a generalization of the marshall and palmer 1948 distribution 4 n d d d n o d μ e x p λ d d d in which no μ and λ are the three parameters of the distribution the kinetic power pn j m 2 s 1 knowing both dsd and terminal velocity has to be calculated as salles et al 2002 5 p n 10 6 ρ π 12 0 v 2 d d 3 n d d d carollo and ferro 2015 using eqs 3 4 and 5 deduced theoretically the following expression of the kinetic power 6 p n 10 6 9 5 2 7 2 ρ 1 2 6 λ 1 4 μ 1 12 λ 1 4 μ i where ρ is water density kg m 3 eq 6 allows an indirect measurement of the ratio pn i if the dsd of a given rainfall intensity is measured and its parameters μ and λ are estimated carollo et al 2017 according to eq 6 the ratio pn i only depends on the intrinsic characteristics of rainfall affecting the two parameters of ulbrich s dsd taking into account that the median volume diameter cm do of the ulbrich s distribution i e the drop diameter that divides the dsd into two parts of equal volume can be calculated by the following relationship ulbrich 1983 7 d o 3 67 μ λ eq 6 can be rewritten as follows 8 p n 10 6 9 5 2 7 2 ρ 1 2 6 d o 3 67 μ 1 4 μ 1 12 d o 3 67 μ 1 4 μ i therefore for a given μ value if the median volume diameter do is measured then eq 8 could be applied for carrying out an indirect measurement of the ratio pn i by the median volume diameter do uijlenhoet and stricker 1999 demonstrated that the exponential distribution of marshall and palmer 1948 when represents the number of raindrops with diameter between d and d dd arriving at a surface per unit area and per unit time can be assumed formally identical to the gamma distribution ulbrich 1983 characterized by μ 0 67 carollo et al 2016 as a consequence from eq 8 the following theoretical relationship is deduced 9 p n 10 6 9 5 2 7 2 ρ 1 2 6 d o 4 34 1 4 67 1 12 d o 4 34 1 4 67 i which expresses that the ratio pn i as a function only on the median volume diameter of the distribution when the rainfall intensity i exceeds a threshold value d0 assumes a constant value and according to eq 9 the ratio pn i becomes constant in other words eq 9 represents a theoretical confirmation of the wischmeier and smith 1978 hypothesis in fact for it 76 mm h pn i is equal to 28 3 j m 2 mm 1 because d0 assumes a constant value too carollo et al 2016 using dsd measurements carried out with different techniques and in different geographical sites carollo et al 2017 highlighted that the measured pairs pn i and do i are site specific and or depend on the applied measurement technique these measurements suggested also that the relationship between pn i and d0 is not site dependent and can be represented by eq 9 in other words eq 9 theoretically deduced is reliable to represent the erosive power of the precipitation everywhere these results allowed to state that d0 is the diameter useful to characterize the rainfall impact on soil surface from an energetic point of view carollo et al 2018 for a given rainfall intensity the practical application of eq 9 for calculating the rainfall kinetic power pn requires the knowledge of the whole dsd which is represented by do therefore from a practical point of view the application of eq 9 becomes attractive only if the median volume diameter can be directly measured or estimated by other information which does not require the knowledge of the whole rainfall dsd 4 theoretical relationship between rainfall kinetic power and mean volume diameter if a drop size distribution of a real rainfall is replaced with a simplified one which is constituted by all droplets having the same size equal to the mean volume diameter of the distribution dm cm and the two distributions real and simplified have also the same rainfall volume the following relationship can be written 10 n π 6 d m 3 i 1 n π 6 d i 3 in which n m 2 s 1 is the total number of droplets per unit area and unit of time of the dsd from eq 10 the diameter dm is calculated by the following relationship 11 d m i 1 n d i 3 n 3 taking into account the definition of simplified dsd eq 10 the following expression of the rainfall intensity is also obtained 12 i n π 6 d m 3 therefore from eq 12 the mean volume diameter is obtained as follows 13 d m i n π 6 3 from a practical point of view this equation implies that the mean volume diameter dm can be calculated using the conventional rainfall intensity measurement and counting the total number of droplets which can be acquired by a cheap device that uses a piezoelectric force transducer jayawardena and rezaur 2000 from a theoretical point of view considering the distribution proposed by ulbrich 1983 the rainfall intensity i m s 1 can be calculated by the following expression salles et al 2002 14 i π 6 0 d 3 n d d d π 6 n o 0 d 3 μ e x p λ d d d taking into account that olver 1997 15 0 d 3 μ e x p λ d d d γ 4 μ λ 4 μ where γ is the gamma function eq 14 reduces to 16 i π 6 n 0 γ 4 μ λ 4 μ according to eq 16 the rainfall intensity is a function of no μ and λ parameters of the ulbrich s distribution the total number of droplets n m 2 s 1 which reach a horizontal unit area in an unit time can be obtained integrating eq 4 17 n n o 0 d μ e x p λ d d d n o λ μ 1 γ μ 1 rearranging eq 13 using eqs 16 and 17 the following expression of the mean volume diameter dm is deduced 18 d m i n π 6 3 π 6 n 0 γ μ 4 λ 4 μ n o λ μ 1 γ μ 1 π 6 3 1 λ 3 γ μ 4 γ μ 1 3 1 λ γ μ 4 γ μ 1 3 according to which dm is function of μ and λ parameters of ulbrich distribution taking into account that 19 γ μ 1 μ γ μ eq 18 can be rearranged as follows 20 d m 1 λ μ 3 μ 2 μ 1 3 combining eqs 7 and 20 the following relationship is obtained 21 d o d m k d 3 67 μ μ 3 μ 2 μ 1 3 the ratio kd between the median volume diameter do and the mean volume diameter dm of the distribution is only a function of μ parameter the values of the ratio kd calculated by eq 21 are plotted versus μ parameter in fig 1 for the marshall and palmer distribution μ 0 67 kd is equal to 1 709 when μ varies from 0 to 4 kd ranges from 2 02 to 1 29 fig 1 combining eq 21 and eq 8 the rainfall kinetic power can be estimated as follows 22 p n 10 6 9 5 2 7 2 ρ 1 2 6 k d d m 3 67 μ 1 4 μ 1 12 k d d m 3 67 μ 1 4 μ i considering the marshall and palmer distribution per unit time and area with μ 0 67 kd is equal to 1 709 therefore eq 22 gives 23 p n 10 6 9 5 2 7 2 ρ 1 2 2 36 d m 1 4 67 1 4 72 d m 1 4 67 i eq 23 theoretically deduced highlights that the rainfall kinetic power depends on the mean volume diameter of the distribution and rainfall intensity in other words if the marshall and palmer distribution per unit area and time is reliable to describe the dsd the measurement of the mean volume diameter dm and of the rainfall intensity i would allow us to have an indirect measurement of the kinetic power of the precipitation 5 disdrometric measurements for testing the proposed method for indirectly measuring rainfall kinetic power the dsds detected using the same optical disdrometer model odm 70 made by eigenbrodt installed in two experimental sites located at palermo south italy and el teularet spain fig 2 were used the palermo experimental station is located at the department of agricultural food and forest sciences of the university of palermo at 40 a s l the el teularet experimental site is located at sierra de enguera at 100 km southwest from valencia at 760 m a s l for each raining minute the disdrometer measures drop diameter in the range 0 05 0 6 cm each drop is separately measured and registered into classes of about 0 005 cm width the disdrometer divides diameter range into 128 classes and gives the number of drops belonging to a particular class for each recording minute drop diameter is measured registering light damping due to the passage of the drop in the control volume between two diodes this volume has cylindrical shape with a length of 12 cm and a diameter of 2 2 cm disdrometer measures simultaneously diameter and falling velocity of the drops that pass through the control volume grossklaus et al 1998 carollo and ferro 2015 the disdrometer registered 544 rainfall events in the period june 2006 april 2014 at palermo experimental site and 79 events at el teularet experimental site in the period july 2015 may 2016 for each rainfall event only the dsds corresponding to rainfall intensity greater than 0 5 mm h and for which measured diameter classes were at least 20 were considered this choice allowed to exclude both rainfall having a low erosive power and dsds having a small sample size carollo and ferro 2015 carollo et al 2016a this procedure provided 45 802 one minute dsds for palermo and 5537 dsds for el teularet carollo et al 2018 named single dsds characterized by i determined by eq 14 that varied in the range 0 5 203 mm h 1 and 0 7 289 mm h 1 respectively for detecting the reliability of the eqs 1 2 9 and 23 the calculated values of the rainfall kinetic power pn c were a compared with those pn m obtained applying eq 3 to the dsd data measured by the disdrometer this comparison was carried out using as statistical index i the mean absolute error mae expressed as percentage 24 mae 100 n dsd i 1 n dsd p n c i p n m i p n m i ii the mean square error mse 25 m s e i 1 n dsd p n m i p n c i 2 n dsd in which ndsd is the number of measured dsd pn ci and pn mi are respectively the calculated and measured rainfall kinetic power of a single dsd iii the bias expressed as percentage 26 bias 100 n dsd i 1 n dsd p n c i p n m i p n m i and iv the percentage f20 of calculated rainfall kinetic power values having an error greater than 20 6 testing the reliability of available relationships for calculating rainfall kinetic power figs 3 and 4 respectively for palermo and el teularet sites show the comparison between measured kinetic power pn m and those calculated pn c by eqs 1 ws and 2 with the parameters estimated by both brown and foster bf and mcgregor et al mg figs 3 and 4 demonstrate that eqs 1 and 2 have a comparable overall agreement with the measured kinetic power values these equations also tend to overestimate and underestimate the highest kinetic power values pn m 1 j m 2 s 1 at palermo and el teularet sites respectively for testing the reliability of eqs 9 and 23 the μ parameter was estimated using the maximum likelihood method fig 5 shows the μ parameter versus rainfall intensity for palermo fig 5a and el teularet fig 5b datasets in the same figure the line representing the moving average calculated using samples having a size of 20 data is also plotted in particular fig 5 highlights that beyond a starting decreasing trend with i for values of the rainfall intensity i 50 60 mm h 1 the μ parameter assumes a quasi constant value which is close to 0 67 for palermo while is slightly greater than 0 67 for el teularet data set this result demonstrates that marshall and palmer distribution can be applied to palermo data set for rainfall intensity values 50 60 mm h 1 fig 6 shows a comparison between measured kinetic power values pn m and those calculated pn c by eqs 9 and 23 for each site table 1 shows goodness of fit statistics of these applied relationships table 1 and fig 6 demonstrate that eq 9 which requires the measurement of do had the best performance for estimating kinetic power with mae of 5 7 and 9 7 and a bias of 2 and 0 1 in palermo and el teularet respectively in other words eq 9 with the measured do values is characterized by the minimum value of mae and can be considered unbiased this result yields to conclude that the median volume diameter allows to accurately characterize precipitation from the erosive point of view from an applicative point of view eq 9 has the inconvenience of requiring the knowledge of the whole dsd if a direct measurement technique of do is not available for both sites the goodness of fit statistics also demonstrate that estimate accuracy of the rainfall kinetic power by eq 23 is comparable with that of eqs 1 and 2 using the parameters estimated by brown and foster 1987 and mcgregor et al 1995 however eqs 1 and 2 are empirical relationships whose reliability should be tested by measurements carried out in the investigated area eq 23 being a theoretically deduced equation does not require reliability tests in addition even if in this investigation dm was obtained directly from the measured dsd eq 23 can be applied without measuring the whole dsd as dm can be calculated by eq 13 and carrying out the direct measurement of both rainfall intensity i and the total number of droplets n this information i n can be acquired by a cheap device that uses a piezoelectric force transducer jayawardena and rezaur 2000 fig 7 shows the pairs do dm of dsd measured in both experimental sites the low correlation of the mean volume diameter dm with the median volume diameter do values highlights that for a fixed dm value dsds having different values of the median volume diameter can occur fig 8 shows as an example two distributions having the same rainfall volume dm is constant which are characterized by both different shape and corresponding do values in other words two raindrop size distributions having the same volume can have different do values due to a different dsd shape according to eq 21 two raindrop size distributions having the same dm can have a different kd value which only depends on the shape parameter μ serio et al 2019 of the ulbrich s distribution these results suggest that the mean volume diameter dm is a scale parameter since this diameter establishes a simple similarity relationship between the true dsd and the simplified one having the same total rainfall volume the mean volume diameter dm is not able to take into account that the same rainfall volume can be attributed to rainfalls having a different dsd shape on the contrary the characteristic diameter do is able to take into account the scale and the shape of the dsd the median volume diameter do was thus correlated with dm scale parameter and the standard deviation of the diameters shape parameter σ d according to the following equation 27 d 0 α d m β σ d γ where α β and γ are site specific coefficients in particular for palermo α 0 32 β 0 007 γ 0 82 and for el teularet α 0 23 β 0 20 and γ 1 02 for both sites fig 9 shows the comparison between measured kinetic power values and those calculated by eqs 9 with do estimated by eq 27 for pn 0 5 j m 2 s 1 the use of the eq 9 with the median volume diameter estimated by eq 27 yields to have a systematic underestimation of the measured rainfall kinetic power producing a mean absolute error of pn of 6 6 and 13 for palermo and el teluaret respectively table 1 if the whole range of pn values is considered table 1 shows that a slightly positive bias 2 3 and 3 5 for palermo and el teluaret respectively occurs however only 2 2 for palermo and 20 for el teularet of measurements present an error 20 table 1 for pn 0 5 j m 2 s 1 corresponding to precipitation characterized by rainfall intensity 40 mm h 1 the systematic underestimation of the rainfall kinetic power by eq 9 is due to the circumstance that eq 27 tends to underestimate the do values for i 40 mm h 1 fig 10 the goodness of fit statistics listed in table 1 also shows that the results obtained by eq 9 with do estimated by eq 27 are intermediate between the worst scenario represented by eqs 1 2 23 and the best scenario corresponding to eq 9 with the measured do values for explaining this systematic underestimation of the rainfall kinetic power by eq 9 coupled with eq 27 the d0 i relationship can be also studied fig 11 shows the pairs i d0 distinguished for the ranges pn 0 5 j m 2 s 1 and for pn 0 5 j m 2 s 1 measured at palermo a and el teularet b the measurements highlight that for pn 0 5 j m 2 s 1 corresponding to precipitation characterized by rainfall intensity 40 mm h 1 the median volume diameter has an increasing trend with i for pn 0 5 j m 2 s 1 corresponding to rainfall with i 40 mm h 1 the median volume diameter do does not depend on rainfall intensity and assumes a constant value equal to 0 27 cm for palermo and 0 30 cm for el teularet this last result do is constant for i 40 mm h 1 and pn 0 5 j m 2 s 1 justifies that the use of eq 9 with do values estimated by eq 27 for precipitations characterized by i 40 mm h 1 provides a systematic underestimation of the kinetic power table 2 the estimate of the rainfall kinetic power by eq 9 for i 40 mm h 1 using a constant value of do equal to the mean value 0 27 or 0 30 cm is shown in fig 12 in this case eq 9 with a constant value of do for pn 0 5 j m 2 s 1 gives a reliable kinetic power estimate which is characterized by a mean percentage error μ e 3 7 and 4 3 for palermo and el teularet dataset respectively table 2 fig 11 in conclusion for both examined datasets the developed analysis highlighted that i the best estimate of pn is obtained by the theoretically deduced eq 9 whose practical attractiveness depends on a reliable estimate of the median volume diameter without requiring the knowledge of the whole dsd ii the accuracy of the theoretically deduced eq 23 is comparable with that obtained by available relationships wischmeier and smith brown and foster and mcgregor et al eq 23 requires the mean volume diameter dm which can be calculated using the conventional rainfall intensity measurement and counting the total number of droplets which can be acquired by a cheap device that uses a piezoelectric force transducer iii eq 9 coupled with do estimated by eq 27 yields pn estimates which are more accurate that those obtained by eqs 1 and 2 even if a systematic underestimation of pn can be observed for pn 0 5 j m 2 s 1 iv for pn 0 5 j m 2 s 1 corresponding to i 40 mm h 1 the median volume diameter does not depend on rainfall intensity and assumes a constant value v eq 9 coupled with a constant value of do gives a reliable kinetic power estimates for pn 0 5 j m 2 s 1 vi using eq 9 for pn 0 5 j m 2 s 1 the kinetic power is function of do and i instead for pn 0 5 j m 2 s 1 the kinetic power is proportional to rainfall intensity since do assumes a constant value 7 conclusions understanding rainfall characteristics such as drop size distribution dsd intensity and kinetic power allows to establish an indicator of rainfall erosivity useful for the prediction of soil erosion in this paper using a simplified rainfall which is constituted by all droplets having the same diameter mean volume diameter and having the same volume of the real rainfall a new expression of the rainfall kinetic power was firstly theoretically deduced for the marshall and palmer distribution referred to unit area and time the analysis showed that the rainfall kinetic power can be estimated by the contemporaneous measurement of both the mean volume diameter and the rainfall intensity in particular we propose that the mean volume diameter dm can be calculated using the conventional rainfall intensity measurement and counting the total number of droplets which can be acquired by a cheap device that uses a piezoelectric force transducer the analysis also showed that the theoretically deduced eq 9 has the best performance in estimating the kinetic power the measured kinetic power values allow also to conclude that the theoretically deduced relationship pn i dm eq 23 has an accuracy similar to the literature relationships taking into account that the median diameter is able to represent both the scale and the shape of the dsd for both datasets the median volume diameter resulted related to the mean volume diameter and the standard deviation of the raindrop diameters this circumstance also justifies the best performance of eq 9 with respect to eq 23 in estimating the rainfall kinetic power the analysis also established that eq 9 with do estimated by eq 27 yields pn estimates which are more accurate that those obtained by eqs 1 and 2 even if a systematic underestimation of pn can be observed for pn 0 5 j m 2 s 1 for i 40 mm h 1 the estimate of pn by eq 9 was improved using a median volume diameter independent of rainfall intensity and assuming a constant value for each site in other words using eq 9 for pn 0 5 j m 2 s 1 resulted a kinetic power which depends on d0 and i while for pn 0 5 j m 2 s 1 the kinetic power is simply proportional to rainfall intensity the obtained results require to be validated in wide range of sites with contrasting climatology and should be also tested using measurement methods that only inform on the number of drops and rainfall intensity further research should be directed towards the development of measurement techniques able to provide simple and accurate values of the mean volume diameter and the standard deviation of the raindrop size distribution declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements all authors set up the research analyzed and interpreted the results and contributed to write the

the results showed that for all the three stations nne could increase the average performance by single models up to 14 in the verification phase this justified the reliability and robustness of nne in multi step ahead modeling of do due to its promising ability in solving nonlinear processes keywords artificial intelligence ensemble techniques water quality parameters yamuna river 1 introduction the assessment of water resources and the management of their quality and quantity has become a hot topic in hydro environmental studies with increase in the world population as an environmental problem gradual increase in pollutants concentration of water causes low dissolved oxygen do contents which degrades the habitat of aquatic animals hence accurate predictions of water quality wq parameters such as do is a critical requirement to safeguard aquatic ecosystems and to sustain effective management decisions donohue and irvine 2008 parmar and bhardwaj 2014 do is one of the most significant wq parameters indicating the environmental health of a river ahmed 2017 do depends on several physical chemical and biological factors e g temperature depletion of oxygen salinity and sufficient do amount in the rivers is vital for the survival of aquatic animals and basic for decomposition of the organic matter during the last decades the do level in the rivers has been quantified either by deterministic or stochastic models e g see hull et al 2008 since there are several factors involved in the process it is difficult to estimate do level by traditional methods in addition apart from complexity and nonlinearity of the aquatic environment high cost of wq monitoring often caused serious issues for wq modeling in order to overcome the limitations of the traditional modeling the implementation of artificial intelligence ai based models have been employed recently in different hydro environmental studies cobaner et al 2009 imrie et al 2000 elkiran et al 2018 ai based black box models like artificial neural network ann adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and support vector machine svm etc play a crucial role in the estimation of complex physical interactions and could lead to more accurate results in the prediction of non linear wq processes turan and yurdusev 2009 quej et al 2017 ranjbar et al 2018 for instance palani et al 2008 estimated do

estimate do and biological oxygen demand bod content in the gomti river india ranković et al 2010 tested ffnn capability in modeling do by employing several water quality parameters and show that ph and water temperature are the most effective variables for prediction of do ay and kisi 2011 studied the efficiency of radial basis neural network rbnn and multi layer perceptron mlp algorithms in modeling do contents in foundation creek colorado the results demonstrated better performance of two ann models with regard to the multi linear regression mlr model in order to cover and inherent shortcomings of ann models such as prone to over fitting problem of local minima anfis as a hybrid learning algorithm has been applied for wq modeling as well for examples chen and liu 2014 employed the back propagation neural network bpnn and anfis models for do modeling and the obtained results demonstrated the superiority of anfis with regards to the ann model najah et al 2014 employed the anfis and mlp modeling tools to estimate do values in the johar river using different input combinations of temperature ph nitrate no3 and ammonia nh3 the obtained results showed that anfis model could lead to better efficiency more recently support vector machine svm as another ai based technique has been used in hydro environmental studies the svm can be used as satisfactory approach in prediction classification regression and pattern recognition issues cortes and vapnik 1995 tarmizi et al 2014 modeled do in the terengganu river applying svm model using temperature ph chemical oxygen

the linear class of black box models are often used as traditional time series method of forecasting gaya et al 2014 faruk 2010 conducted a study to predicted wq variables including do using ann arima and a hybrid model and the results depicted that hybrid model could be more reliable than ann and arima models hanh et al 2010 employed arima model to investigate wq variables based on different hydro climatological factors in a river the results by the arima model revealed that among climatic and hydrological parameters wq could be effectively predicted from the data in the literature review there is not a particular and exceptional model with regards to the others and therefore to the extent of deteriorations and anthropogenic activities along the catchment of the river the combination of various models using ensemble techniques may lead to more accurate outcomes the general concept of such ensemble modeling technique has been applied to different engineering field partalas et al 2008 applied the general framework of ensemble selection algorithms on a real water quality data cloke and pappenberger 2009 indicated that the use of ensemble flood prediction is becoming a widespread because of its merit to handle the uncertainties involved in the process however since the emergence of ensemble techniques in different fields of science and engineering there is no accomplished or published research to the best knowledge of the authors indicating the application of ai based ensemble modeling of river wq parameters in general and do in particular in yamuna river therefore the present work is focused on the application of three types of ai based models e g bpnn anfis svm and a classical linear mode arima for single and multistep ahead predictions of do in the yamuna river india for this do bod cod water discharge q ph ammonia nh3 and water temperature wt data from 3 different stations on the river are imposed into the models in order to enhance the general performance of the prediction ensemble modeling is also employed using the outputs of the single models in this way three different types of ensemble techniques as simple averaging ensemble sae weighted averaging ensemble wae and non linear neural ensemble nne are used and the results are computed together 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data the major side stream and influent branch of ganga river is attributed to yamuna river with the catchment covering length of about 1376 km and covers approximately about 57 million demand of north indian inhabitants the river has been generally belief as the holy place where tradition culture and pilgrimage within and cross the india are conducted for example at utter pradesh himachal pradesh and uttaranchal yamunotri located at the bank of the river the total area of yamuna catchment is 366 223 km2 and its annual discharge is nearly 10 000 m3 s which approximately provides about 70 of water to delhi for domestic and other activities however due to the population increase rapid growth of urbanization and lack of efficient facilities to treat the water the river leaves delhi catchment as polluted water elkiran et al 2018 singh et al 2005 data from three stations over the river as sample location sl were used in multi station modeling in this study as described below also see fig 1 2 1 1 hathnikund sl1 this location provides wq after some tributaries of low himalaya region joins the yamuna river before receiving significant pollution from the urban center also the location provides information about impact of drain outfalls at paonta sahib 2 1 2 nizamuddin sl2 the wq at this station indicates the influence of concentrated sewage discharge which is almost 14 km from barrage of wazirabad at down stream 2 1 3 udi sl3 this location depicts the wq of the chambal river before it joins to the yamuna river central pollution control board 2010 the selected stations cover the significant profile of the yamuna river and potential of wq or extent of pollution load despite the pollution sources can impact on wq values as boundary condition but it should be noted that in the proposed black box modeling as an autoregressive process the current status of the process is related to the previous values initial condition as markov chain in which these previous values available as historical observed data implicitly include sources information such as autoregressive based modeling is widely used at different fields of engineering for time series predictions e g in streamflow modeling see turan and yurdusev 2009 yaseen et al 2015 as well as wq parameters modeling e g see abbas pour et al 2007 ay and kisi 2011 the knowledge of data and descriptive statistical analysis is paramount important in any ai based models in order to understand the relationship and the extent of the strength between the input output variables the normalization of the data was conducted before the model calibration which is usually performed in ai based modeling to ensure the data dependencies nourani et al 2012 the available monthly wq data set from the central pollution control board cpcb for the years 1999 2012 includes measured do mg l bod mg l cod mg l q m3 s ph ammonia nh3 mg l and wt c for all 3 stations the available parameters selected for the purposed of this research were considered as the most dominants parameters in yamuna river by central pollution control board 2010 as confirmed by other several studies such as taskeena et al 2017 parmar and bhardwaj 2014 sharma and kansal 2011 however according to perlman 2013 temperature is an important physical property of river systems and increase in water temperature decreases the solubility of do in water in case of bod ademoroti 1996 reported that the greater the decomposable organic matter present the greater the oxygen demand and greater the bod cod determines the amount of oxygen consumed in the chemical oxidation of chemical compounds the nh3 is an important parameter for water quality assessment taskeena et al 2017 several studies such as zhao et al 2014 wang et al 2013a b and zhang et al 2009 confirmed the positive relationship between do and ph table 1 depicts the statistical analysis of the data from each sl the 75 data were used for model calibration while the remaining 25 were employed in the verification phase from table 1 it can be seen that the lowest values of do were observed in sl2 this is due to the partially treated and untreated domestic and industrial wastewaters discharged into the river through various drains generally the bod and cod values recorded in all the sl crossed the standard limits prescribed by who as 6 mg l and 10 mg l for bod and cod respectively see table 1 it can be seen in table 2 that the correlation values of bod and cod are high at sl1 with regards to sl2 and sl3 this is due to less discharge across sl1which also indicates the presence of biological activities moreover other standard values of ph and nh3 prescribed by who and bureau of indian standard bis are 6 5 8 5 and who 50 bis 0 10 respectively mean values range are 15 0 2 84 and 0 93 0 11 to 6 3 0 81 mg l for wt and do respectively world health organization 2004 bureau of indian standards bis 1986 due to the high discharge from industries at sl2 and sl3 the wt depicts high values in these stations see table 1 it is very essential in any ai based modeling to choose the most significant input variables as such suitable combination of inputs shall be determined prior the modeling table 2 shows the pearson correlation coefficients r values between variables the r values show the linear correlation between the parameters and according to the correlation coefficient values in table 2 the linearity between the variables and do is not so significance this implies the need to use nonlinear models such as ai based method instead of classic linear method for modeling wq parameters of the stations the r values between q and wq parameters show quite higher relationship between some parameters at the stations 2 2 proposed methodology in this study first bpnn anfis svr and arima models were proposed separately for modeling the wq parameters of yamuna river along 3 selected sls as mentioned in section 2 1 in this way the modeling is performed to model the do as a sample wq parameter but other parameters may also be estimated in the similar manner thereafter ensemble approach is used to enhance the prediction accuracy of do by combining the outputs of the single models it is difficult to determine in practice whether one particular model is better than others thus selecting the proper method for a particular case is a difficult task for the predictors the complexity of selecting the appropriate models could be resolved by choosing assemble of various models the traditional linear models are still used despite the inability to provide the accurate outputs due to their various limitations and inconsistences to handle non stationary and non linearity data such linear models are still applicable because a traditional linear models are economical uncomplicated and the natural phenomenon can be employed in a functional linear system b non linear models magnify the noise for additional time steps while the linear models increase the noise included in the data linearly therefore applying the traditional linear model for linear portions of the process is recommended the natural and real world processes may contain both the linear and non linear characteristic as such arima model is not capable of handling non linear system solely on the other hand an ai model may expand the noise of the linear pattern and therefore both of the models cannot adequately estimate the time series of the process individually hence by combining results of arima and ai models the magnify non linear behaviors of the noise and complex architecture can be addressed in a simple approach the objective of the proposed methodology in this study is to predict do time series of the yamuna river using different combinations of input parameters for this purpose 3 sl and four different black box models are considered and then the outputs of the single models are calibrated within the ensemble techniques the mathematical expression to model do at different stations can be written as 1 d o t 1 1 f d o t 1 d o t n 1 w t t 1 q t 1 d o t 1 2 f d o t 2 d o t n 2 w t t 2 q t 2 q t 1 d o t 1 d o t 1 3 f d o t 3 d o t n 3 w t t 3 q t 3 q t 2 d o t 2 in eq 1 upper index denotes to the station member sl1 sl2 and sl3 and lower index stands for the time step according to the autoregressive property of the process and the effluent of each station on the downstream do value at each station may be consider as a function of q and do at upper stream station wt and do values at previous time steps as eq 1 in order to do multi step ahead modeling of do the target output at k time step ahead could be presented as 2 s l 1 d o t k 1 f d o t 1 d o t n 1 w t t 1 q t 1 s l 2 d o t k 2 f d o t 2 d o t n 2 w t t 2 q t 2 q t 1 d o t 1 s l 3 d o t k 3 f d o t 3 d o t n 3 w t t 3 q t 3 q t 2 d o t 2 the trial and error procedure may be applied to determine the lag time n t n the proposed methodology of the study is schematically described in fig 2 2 3 back propagation neural network bpnn bpnn which is known as multi layer feed forward neural network ffnn is the most widely used ann training usually by lavenberg marquardt algorithm asce 2000 fig 3 shows the architecture of the bpnn used in this study the functions of nonlinear processing elements are summing up the incoming information and generate the outputs which are propagated backwards until the required target is achieved nourani et al 2017 in this network all the neurons are connected by terms with variable weights the main concept of bpnn is that the weight is adjusted through the mean square error of the output until error is minimized so that the network can learn the training data asce 2000 2 4 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis an adaptive network based fuzzy inference system anfis as ai based model developed by jang in 1993 anfis has the ability to overcome the limitations of fuzzy inference and ann anfis model combines the ability of both ann and fuzzy logic to create a process that has the ability of handling complex non linear interactions between a set of input and output the general structure of an anfis can be shown in fig 4 anfis provides promising capability in the prediction and forecasting of river hydro climatology and reservoir modeling due to the integration and ability of fuzzy to handle uncertainty and the strength of ann jang 1993 kisi 2009 solgi et al 2017 assuming x y are the input and f is the output of a fuzzy inference system the first order sugeno type as the following rules eqs 3 and 4 3 rule 1 i f μ x i s a 1 a n d μ y i s b 1 t h e n f 1 p 1 x q 1 y r 1 4 rule 2 i f μ x i s a 2 a n d μ y i s b 2 t h e n f 2 p 2 x q 2 y r 2 for a given inputs x and y the membership function are indicated as a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 outlet functions parameters are p 1 q 1 r 1 p 2 q 2 r 2 the structural formula and arrangement of 5 layer anfis are as followed layer 1 the node function of this layer as in eq 5 is an adaptive node i 5 q i 1 μ ai x for i 1 2 or q i 1 μ bi x for i 3 4 q i 1 stands for membership grade for x and y inputs and the selected membership function was gaussian membership function because it reduces the error in the prediction process layer 2 each input layer is links with an operator called t norm that is accomplished with and operator as eq 6 6 q i 2 w i μ ai x μ bi y for i 1 2 layer 3 the output in this layer is known as normalized firing strength and each node is labelled as norm 7 q i 3 w i w i w 1 w 2 i 1 2 layer 4 in this layer each node i performs the subsequence rules as an adaptive node 8 q i 4 w i p i x q i y r i w i f i p 1 q 1 r 1 are irregular parameters referred to as consequent parameters layer 5 the product of all the incoming signals are computed for the overall output layers as eq 9 9 q i 5 w i p i x q i y r i i w i f i i w i f i i w i 2 5 support vector machine svm support vector machine svm as the ai based model that is capable of providing the satisfactory solutions to the problems of regression prediction classification and pattern recognitions nourani et al 2018 svm was first introduced by cortes and vapnik 1995 with two important functions such as statistical learning theory and structural risk minimization that distinct it from other ai based models the svm model are capable of minimizing the complexity and noise error in the structures and also enhance the generalization performance of the network therefore svm is based on the two basic structural layers first layer is kernel function weighting on the input parameters and the weighted sum of kernel outputs is the second function granata et al 2017 in svm linear sigmoid polynomial and radial basis function rbf are the four alternative methods used as kernel function the kernel rbf was applied in this study due to its robustness to simulate complex nonlinear function wang et al 2013a b in svm model the data set is close fitted inform of linear regression and subsequently the non linear kernel converts the resulting linear outputs using non linear pattern of the data the calibration data is given as x i d i i n xi is the input vector di is the actual value and n is sum of the data the overall svm function is given as 10 y f x w ϕ x i b where φ xi indicates feature spaces non linearly mapped from input vector x cortes and vapnik 1995 11 minimize 1 2 w 2 c i n ξ i ξ i subject to w i ϕ x i b i d i ε ξ i d i w i ϕ x i b i ε ξ i ξ i ξ i i 1 2 n where 1 2 w 2 is the weights vector norm and c is referred to the regularized constant the general conceptual model structure of svm is illustrated in fig 5 the problems of dual quadratic optimization can be addressed by alteration process of optimization in which the parameters of lagrange multipliers are defined αi and αi vector w in eq 12 can be calculated after finding the problem solution of optimization nourani et al 2018 12 w i 1 n α i α i ϕ x i therefore the overall form of svm can be inform of eq 15 13 f x α i α i i 1 n α i α i k x x i b where k xi xj is the kernel function and b is bias term the radial basis function gaussian is the most common kernel function and is expressed as haghiabi et al 2017 14 k x 1 x 2 exp γ x 1 x 2 2 where γ is the kernel parameter 2 6 auto regressive integrated moving average arima arima has been one of the most popular classic models for time series forecasting known as box and jenkins model faruk 2010 arima model can be categorized by various classifications of time series such as autoregressive ar moving average ma and combined ar and ma arma series the major drawback of arima is pre assumption of linear model kavasseri and seetharaman 2009 the three iterative stages used in arima modeling are estimation of parameters diagnostic checking and identifying model the time series data must be checked to be stationary in the model identification stage as it is essential in creating an arima model in order to identify the order of arima model autocorrelation function acf and partial autocorrelation function pacf have been proposed by box et al 1976 to calibrate the model the best fitted models are chosen by considering the minimum error efficiency and the three main steps for building the model is iterated until the desire model is obtained faruk 2010 2 7 performance efficiency criteria the various statistical measures can be used to assessed the performance efficiency of the model including determination coefficient dc or r2 root mean square error rmse mean absolute relative error mare mean absolute error mae agreement index d standard error of prediction sep according to legates and mccabe 1999 the model efficiency performance should include at least one goodness of fit e g dc and at least one absolute error measure e g rmse therefore in order to assess the predicting efficiency of the models dc and rmse were employed in this study as nourani et al 2011 15 dc 1 i 1 n do obs i do com i 2 i 1 n do obs i do obs 2 16 rmse i 1 n do obs i do com i 2 n where n do do obs and d o co m i are data number measured do average value of the measured do and computed do value respectively dc ranges between and 1 with a perfect score of 1 2 8 ensemble learning it is clear that single models e g ai based models produce different performances for same inputs based on the robustness or limitations hence ensemble modeling could effectively improve the general performance of the time series prediction ensemble methods have been already applied in some fields of science such as web ranking algorithm classification and clustering of time series and regression problems sharghi et al 2018 this study employed three ensemble techniques in order to improve the predicting performance of single models as a simple averaging ensemble sae b weighted averaging ensemble wae and c the non linear neural network ensemble nne 2 8 1 technique 1 simple averaging ensemble sae in this technique bpnn anfis svm and arima models are employed separately and then sae output is generated by averaging the outputs of all the single models 2 8 2 technique 2 weighted average ensemble wae this technique is employed by applying various weights to the outputs of the individual model s outputs based on the relative significant of the outputs the basic difference between sae and wae is that the assigned weight of wae to each variable is based on the relative significance unlike the case of sae where equal weights are assigned to all outputs nourani et al 2018 the weighted averaging ensemble technique is expressed as 17 d o t i 1 n w i d o t i where w i is the assigned weight on output of the ith model do t is ensemble output d o i t is the output of ith single model here outputs of bpnn anfis svm and arima and n is the number of single models here n 4 where w i can be computed as 18 w i d c i i n d c i where d c i is the determination coefficient for it h model 2 8 3 technique 3 non linear neural network ensemble nne an bpnn is employed to perform the non linear averaging nne in neural ensemble technique the outputs of the single models are considered to form the input layer of the neural ensemble each of which is assigned to one neuron in the input layer fig 6 presents the schematic of the nne method the procedure of neural ensemble is like that of single bpnn the best architecture and iteration number of the neural ensemble network can be obtained using trial error procedure and the sigmoid may be consider as hidden and output activation function it is worth mentioning that other nonlinear models e g svm anfis may also be used as the kernel of the non linear ensemble prediction instead of bpnn but bpnn was used in this study due to the facts that it s the most commonly used ai method that could lead to outstanding performance in various studies asce 2000 3 results and discussion the bpnn anfis svm and arima models were separately used to predict do at three different sample stations along yamuna river and their performances in calibration and verification steps were examined and compared on the basis of different input combinations 3 1 results of prediction by single models in bpnn modeling the maximum number of iterations mean square error and learning rate were initially set as 1000 0 0001 and 0 01 respectively for the hidden and output layers log sigmoid and purlin were respectively found to be the optimum activation functions in order to construct the best model appropriate number of hidden nodes is essential aspect as too many neurons may lead to overfitting while insufficient neurons may capture unsatisfactory information olyaie et al 2017 according to fletcher and goss 1993 proper number of nodes in the hidden layer ranges from 2n1 2 m to 2n 1 for identification of optimum number of hidden layers where n is the number of input neurons and m is the number of output neurons hence 5 21 was found to be the range of the hidden neurons of typical three layer bpnn model for the prediction of do at three stations of yamuna river the obtained results for the best models for single step modeling are shown in table 3 based on the dc values in the verification phase bpnn performance for stations is in the order of sl2 0 8149 sl3 0 7259 sl1 0 6830 in the anfis modeling different types of membership functions mfs were examined by trial and error to determine the best anfis structure each structure is formed by mf and various epoch iterations table 3 shows the best performance results of single step ahead modeling of anfis for three stations from the obtained results for single step modeling by anfis it can be seen that the results of verification performance of anfis for stations is in the order of sl2 0 9276 sl3 0 8327 sl1 0 7036 different types of svm model structures were detected for all input combinations in order to achieve the best accuracy in the development of svm model the determination of the optimal combination of c and g parameters is highly essential hence grid search method was employed to find out the optimal values granata et al 2017 table 3 depicts the obtained results for the best models for single step modeling by the svm based on the results of the verification phase the performance of svm for stations is in the order of sl3 0 9087 sl2 0 7532 sl1 0 6444 in arima model the optimal parameters were chosen using different trial and error procedures as in the case of ai based models in this study the traditional arima model was developed using time series forecasting tool of eviews software 9 5 the obtained results for the best ai and arima models for single step modeling are shown in table 3 according to table 3 anfis model emerged to be more satisfactory for the prediction of do for all stations which was proved by its high values of dc and low values of rmse fig 7 shows the time series of observed versus predicted do for the best simulated models during the verification phase for sl1 sl2 and sl3 among the models ai based models anfis svm and bpp are more robust than the linear model arima which shows the complex and nonlinear behavior of the process generally the performance of the models can be attributed to the following the sl1 is located downstream from yamunotri and slight pollution in biological water quality is observed at the locations which can significantly impact on the catchment water bodies of sl1 in table 1 it can be seen that all the variables exceeded the prescribe limit of world health organization and environmental protection agency for sl1 in addition wq at this location was not fit for domestic purposes owing to the influence of most chemical parameters as reported by taskeena et al 2017 high or low ph value in a river affects its biota impede recreational uses of water and alter the toxicity of other pollutants in one form or the other therefore the health of the river and aquatic system are affected this conclusion is in consistent with the research conducted at sl1 by parmar and bhardwaj 2014 to estimate monthly wq variables using arima and statistical analysis the results concluded that all the parameters except ph and wt crossed the prescribed limits of who it can be concluded that modeling the do at this location is very crucial due to the fact that yamuna river enters delhi capital of india and account for more than 70 of delhi s water supplies parmar and bhardwaj 2014 the reasonable outcome of the anfis model is due to the ability of anfis to handle uncertainties of the process according to table 1 it can be seen that the mean of do level at sl2 was very low due to high anthropogenic activities that could lead to septic and eutrophic conditions in addition the location depicted a high level of pollution which is primarily due to wastewater discharge from delhi this deteriorates the yamuna river to an alarming extent thereby causing complex physical chemical and biological interactions in the water bodies and hence leading to substantial interactions among the wq parameters this finding corresponds with that pointed by sharma and kansal 2011 to predict water quality index wqi using ccme wqi index the obtained results showed that the wqi fell under poor category at sl2 moreover bod cod and nh3 were found to be critical parameters similarly kumar et al 2005 reported that the major causes of degradation at sl2 are excessive used of domestic and industrial waste leading to low flow at sl2 to sl3 the low flow condition prevalent over a considerable portion of the station and its tributaries have seriously impacted the entire yamuna river the physical and chemical characteristics of water at sl3 show that water is almost are pollution free in this station according to table 1 few parameters show higher recorded values and slightly above the standard limit indicating temporary sign of pollution which may be due to some localized affects the wq at sl3 fairly satisfies the wq criteria for drinking water source after conventional treatment and disinfection the overall health of the river in sl3 has been found satisfactory in which do serves as major indicator hence continues monitoring is useful for the sustainable development through the application of ai based models in order to mitigate the adverse effects of the deprived quality of river water on human health as well as on plant growth the efficiency of multi step ahead predictions of do by anfis bpnn svr and arima models are also presented in table 3 from the table 3 it is clear that by increasing the prediction horizon the modeling accuracy is decreased for further investigation of the models performances at different time spans the predicted values that are closer to observed values implied better performance for examples for two sample points i and ii in fig 7c the details justify that at sample point i the do predictions by the methods were 0 58 0 53 0 49 and 0 45 for bpnn svm arima and anfis respectively whereas for point ii they were 0 62 0 49 0 47 and 0 453 for svm anfis bpnn and arima this proves that the performances of the methods may be different at various spans of the time series as such it is logical to ensemble the outcomes of different methods in order to come up with more accurate prediction results 3 2 results of ensemble predictions in order to improve the overall prediction accuracy of single models the ensemble of outputs of bpnn anfis svm and arima models were carried out based on the three proposed ensemble techniques table 4 depicts the obtained results of sae wae and nne techniques for single and multistep ahead predictions the obtained values of rmse and dc indicate reliable improvement in modeling performance with regards to the single models this performance could be due to the accuracy of each single model it can be seen from table 4 that at sl1 sae wae and nne increased the efficiency performance of the best ai modeling up to 8 10 and 17 respectively in the verification phase for sl2 nne increased the performance of the best ai modeling up to 14 while for anfis outperformed sae and wae by approximately 9 in verification phase this could be due the inability of sae and wae techniques to undergo another process of black box learning unlike the nne finally for sl3 nne and wae increased the performance up to 14 and 8 respectively while svm proved high merit with regards to sae by 8 improvement in the verification phase see table 4 this increase in percentage of efficiency by the ensemble techniques could be due to the integration of single outputs which handle the overall weaknesses of single models fig 8 a c show the scatter plots of computed do by nne versus observed values for sl1 sl2 and sl3 respectively according to the obtained results presented in table 4 the nne outperformed the two ensemble techniques due to the robustness to coup with complex non linear process between inputs and outputs also the obtained ensemble results of multi step ahead for dot 1 dot 3 and dot 5 model show that nne led to average increased up to 9 and 7 with regard to sae and wae at sl1 and up to an average of 8 for both sae and wae techniques at sl2 and up to 10 and 8 for sl3 the better performance of wae over sae could be attributed to the fact that the weights are assigned on the parameters based on the relative importance on the other hand the three ensemble techniques sae wae and nne were also evaluated based on the two dimensional graphical diagram i e taylor diagram that vividly exhibits the observed and predicted values yaseen et al 2019 taylor diagram was used as the recommended diagram for accuracy comparison zhu et al 2019 the combination of two metrics including standard deviation sd and correlation r were constructed to be visualized graphically as a taylor diagram fig 9 taylor 2001 the main target of this diagram is to summarizes multiple performance metrics in one combination and statistically quantifies the degree of similarity between the observed actual do and the predicted values however it is clearly seen that at sl1 the best performance results for sae wae and nne are dot 5 r 0 9001 dot 1 r 0 9208 and dot 3 r 0 9517 respectively similarly for sl2 the results can be arrange as dot 3 r 0 9440 dot 1 r 0 9377 and dot 3 r 0 978928 for sae wae and nne respectively lastly for sl3 the best performance accuracy is attained with dot 3 0 9360 dot 5 0 9594 and dot 5 0 9876 for sae wae and nne respectively from the comparison of the results the mentioned indictor denotes the extent of accuracy of prediction for nne hence nne outperformed other techniques because the observed points are closer to the computed points this can be also affirmed by considering the high value of sd which could be attributed to the nne generally if the sd of the computed values is higher than the sd of observed values then it will result in overestimation and vice versa it is worth mentioning that the profiles of wq parameters are entirely different for each sample station different data profiles and characteristics of data make the model results different even for the same data set different models may exhibit different results due to unique nature of each model due to the importance of the do this parameter was modeled in this study but similar method in the case of the data availability can be used to model other wq parameters 4 conclusions the main aim of this paper was to develop single and multi step ahead prediction models for do as an important wq parameter at three different stations on yamuna river in india using ai based ensemble techniques the do was predicted by different ai models bpnn anfis and svm and a traditional linear model arima next three ensemble techniques were employed to enhance the prediction performance of the single models by evaluating different input combinations and structures it was concluded that at sl1 anfis led to better results in verification phase up to 6 8 and 13 with regards to bpnn svm and arima models respectively for sl2 the obtained results again indicated that anfis model was superior to other models with about 11 17 and 30 for bpp svm and arima respectively however for sl3 the results showed that svm could led to better results in the verification phase up to 7 18 and 23 with regards bpnn anfis and arima models respectively in multi step ahead modeling the performance criteria justified capability of ai based models for do prediction at all stations different outputs of the single models at different time spans confirmed the need to ensemble the outputs of the single models in this regard 2 linear sae and wae and one nonlinear nne ensemble techniques were applied to enhance the predictions for ensemble techniques nne led to better result up to 12 and 9 respectively with regard to sae and wae at sl1 and up to 7 for both sae and wae at sl2 and up to 10 and 8 for sl3 also the obtained ensemble results of multi step ahead for dot 3 and dot 5 model show that nne could lead to average improvement of efficiency up to 9 and 7 with regard to sae and wae at sl1 and up to an average of 8 for both sae and wae at sl2 and up to 10 and 8 for sl3 however for all the three stations nne should be considered as the most robust and reliable ensemble technique due to its nonlinear kernel for prediction of do the outcomes may also suggest that introducing other algorithms with combination of an ensemble techniques could lead to more accurate and reliable prediction not only for modeling do but also for other wq parameters declaration of competing interest none appendix a supplementary data supplementary data to this article can be found online at https doi org 10 1016 j jhydrol 2019 123962 appendix

averagely up to 7 and 19 for sl1 and sl2 in performance accuracy while for sl3 svm model performed better than other models and increased the average performance up to 16 in the ensemble techniques the results showed that for all the three stations nne could increase the average performance by single models up to 14 in the verification phase this justified the reliability and robustness of nne in multi step ahead modeling of do due to its promising ability in solving nonlinear processes keywords artificial intelligence ensemble techniques water quality parameters yamuna river 1 introduction the assessment of water resources and the management of their quality and quantity has become a hot topic in hydro environmental studies with increase in the world population as an environmental problem gradual increase in pollutants concentration of water causes low dissolved oxygen do contents which degrades the habitat of aquatic animals hence accurate predictions of water quality wq parameters such as do is a critical requirement to safeguard aquatic ecosystems and to sustain effective management decisions donohue and irvine 2008 parmar and bhardwaj 2014 do is one of the most significant wq parameters indicating the environmental health of a river ahmed 2017 do depends on several physical chemical and biological factors e g temperature depletion of oxygen salinity and sufficient do amount in the rivers is vital for the survival of aquatic animals and basic for decomposition of the organic matter during the last decades the do level in the rivers has been quantified either by deterministic or stochastic models e g see hull et al 2008 since there are several factors involved in the process it is difficult to estimate do level by traditional methods in addition apart from complexity and nonlinearity of the aquatic environment high cost of wq monitoring often caused serious issues for wq modeling in order to overcome the limitations of the traditional modeling the implementation of artificial intelligence ai based models have been employed recently in different hydro environmental studies cobaner et al 2009 imrie et al 2000 elkiran et al 2018 ai based black box models like artificial neural network ann adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and support vector machine svm etc play a crucial role in the estimation of complex physical interactions and could lead to more accurate results in the prediction of non linear wq processes turan and yurdusev 2009 quej et al 2017 ranjbar et al 2018 for instance palani et al 2008 estimated do and other wq parameters of sea water using temperature nh4 ph etc as input variables feed forward neural network ffnn trained by back propagation algorithm was used successfully by singh et al 2009 to estimate do and biological oxygen demand bod content in the gomti river india ranković et al 2010 tested ffnn capability in modeling do by employing several water quality parameters and show that ph and water temperature are the most effective variables for prediction of do ay and kisi 2011 studied the efficiency of radial basis neural network rbnn and multi layer perceptron mlp algorithms in modeling do contents in foundation creek colorado the results demonstrated better performance of two ann models with regard to the multi linear regression mlr model in order to cover and inherent shortcomings of ann models such as prone to over fitting problem of local minima anfis as a hybrid learning algorithm has been applied for wq modeling as well for examples chen and liu 2014 employed the back propagation neural network bpnn and anfis models for do modeling and the obtained results demonstrated the superiority of anfis with regards to the ann model najah et al 2014 employed the anfis and mlp modeling tools to estimate do values in the johar river using different input combinations of temperature ph nitrate no3 and ammonia nh3 the obtained results showed that anfis model could lead to better efficiency more recently support vector machine svm as another ai based technique has been used in hydro environmental studies the svm can be used as satisfactory approach in prediction classification regression and pattern recognition issues cortes and vapnik 1995 tarmizi et al 2014 modeled do in the terengganu river applying svm model using temperature ph chemical oxygen demand cod nh3 and no3 as inputs yu et al 2016 compared least square svm and radial bpnn for predicting do in the crab ponds at china autoregressive integrated moving average arima which belongs to the linear class of black box models are often used as traditional time series method of forecasting gaya et al 2014 faruk 2010 conducted a study to predicted wq variables including do using ann arima and a hybrid model and the results depicted that hybrid model could be more reliable than ann and arima models hanh et al 2010 employed arima model to investigate wq variables based on different hydro climatological factors in a river the results by the arima model revealed that among climatic and hydrological parameters wq could be effectively predicted from the data in the literature review there is not a particular and exceptional model with regards to the others and therefore to the extent of deteriorations and anthropogenic activities along the catchment of the river the combination of various models using ensemble techniques may lead to more accurate outcomes the general concept of such ensemble modeling technique has been applied to different engineering field partalas et al 2008 applied the general framework of ensemble selection algorithms on a real water quality data cloke and pappenberger 2009 indicated that the use of ensemble flood prediction is becoming a widespread because of its merit to handle the uncertainties involved in the process however since the emergence of ensemble techniques in different fields of science and engineering there is no accomplished or published research to the best knowledge of the authors indicating the application of ai based ensemble modeling of river wq parameters in general and do in particular in yamuna river therefore the present work is focused on the application of three types of ai based models e g bpnn anfis svm and a classical linear mode arima for single and multistep ahead predictions of do in the yamuna river india for this do bod cod water discharge q ph ammonia nh3 and water temperature wt data from 3 different stations on the river are imposed into the models in order to enhance the general performance of the prediction ensemble modeling is also employed using the outputs of the single models in this way three different types of ensemble techniques as simple averaging ensemble sae weighted averaging ensemble wae and non linear neural ensemble nne are used and the results are computed together 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data the major side stream and influent branch of ganga river is attributed to yamuna river with the catchment covering length of about 1376 km and covers approximately about 57 million demand of north indian inhabitants the river has been generally belief as the holy place where tradition culture and pilgrimage within and cross the india are conducted for example at utter pradesh himachal pradesh and uttaranchal yamunotri located at the bank of the river the total area of yamuna catchment is 366 223 km2 and its annual discharge is nearly 10 000 m3 s which approximately provides about 70 of water to delhi for domestic and other activities however due to the population increase rapid growth of urbanization and lack of efficient facilities to treat the water the river leaves delhi catchment as polluted water elkiran et al 2018 singh et al 2005 data from three stations over the river as sample location sl were used in multi station modeling in this study as described below also see fig 1 2 1 1 hathnikund sl1 this location provides wq after some tributaries of low himalaya region joins the yamuna river before receiving significant pollution from the urban center also the location provides information about impact of drain outfalls at paonta sahib 2 1 2 nizamuddin sl2 the wq at this station indicates the influence of concentrated sewage discharge which is almost 14 km from barrage of wazirabad at down stream 2 1 3 udi sl3 this location depicts the wq of the chambal river before it joins to the yamuna river central pollution control board 2010 the selected stations cover the significant profile of the yamuna river and potential of wq or extent of pollution load despite the pollution sources can impact on wq values as boundary condition but it should be noted that in the proposed black box modeling as an autoregressive process the current status of the process is related to the previous values initial condition as markov chain in which these previous values available as historical observed data implicitly include sources information such as autoregressive based modeling is widely used at different fields of engineering for time series predictions e g in streamflow modeling see turan and yurdusev 2009 yaseen et al 2015 as well as wq parameters modeling e g see abbas pour et al 2007 ay and kisi 2011 the knowledge of data and descriptive statistical analysis is paramount important in any ai based models in order to understand the relationship and the extent of the strength between the input output variables the normalization of the data was conducted before the model calibration which is usually performed in ai based modeling to ensure the data dependencies nourani et al 2012 the available monthly wq data set from the central pollution control board cpcb for the years 1999 2012 includes measured do mg l bod mg l cod mg l q m3 s ph ammonia nh3 mg l and wt c for all 3 stations the available parameters selected for the purposed of this research were considered as the most dominants parameters in yamuna river by central pollution control board 2010 as confirmed by other several studies such as taskeena et al 2017 parmar and bhardwaj 2014 sharma and kansal 2011 however according to perlman 2013 temperature is an important physical property of river systems and increase in water temperature decreases the solubility of do in water in case of bod ademoroti 1996 reported that the greater the decomposable organic matter present the greater the oxygen demand and greater the bod cod determines the amount of oxygen consumed in the chemical oxidation of chemical compounds the nh3 is an important parameter for water quality assessment taskeena et al 2017 several studies such as zhao et al 2014 wang et al 2013a b and zhang et al 2009 confirmed the positive relationship between do and ph table 1 depicts the statistical analysis of the data from each sl the 75 data were used for model calibration while the remaining 25 were employed in the verification phase from table 1 it can be seen that the lowest values of do were observed in sl2 this is due to the partially treated and untreated domestic and industrial wastewaters discharged into the river through various drains generally the bod and cod values recorded in all the sl crossed the standard limits prescribed by who as 6 mg l and 10 mg l for bod and cod respectively see table 1 it can be seen in table 2 that the correlation values of bod and cod are high at sl1 with regards to sl2 and sl3 this is due to less discharge across sl1which also indicates the presence of biological activities moreover other standard values of ph and nh3 prescribed by who and bureau of indian standard bis are 6 5 8 5 and who 50 bis 0 10 respectively mean values range are 15 0 2 84 and 0 93 0 11 to 6 3 0 81 mg l for wt and do respectively world health organization 2004 bureau of indian standards bis 1986 due to the high discharge from industries at sl2 and sl3 the wt depicts high values in these stations see table 1 it is very essential in any ai based modeling to choose the most significant input variables as such suitable combination of inputs shall be determined prior the modeling table 2 shows the pearson correlation coefficients r values between variables the r values show the linear correlation between the parameters and according to the correlation coefficient values in table 2 the linearity between the variables and do is not so significance this implies the need to use nonlinear models such as ai based method instead of classic linear method for modeling wq parameters of the stations the r values between q and wq parameters show quite higher relationship between some parameters at the stations 2 2 proposed methodology in this study first bpnn anfis svr and arima models were proposed separately for modeling the wq parameters of yamuna river along 3 selected sls as mentioned in section 2 1 in this way the modeling is performed to model the do as a sample wq parameter but other parameters may also be estimated in the similar manner thereafter ensemble approach is used to enhance the prediction accuracy of do by combining the outputs of the single models it is difficult to determine in practice whether one particular model is better than others thus selecting the proper method for a particular case is a difficult task for the predictors the complexity of selecting the appropriate models could be resolved by choosing assemble of various models the traditional linear models are still used despite the inability to provide the accurate outputs due to their various limitations and inconsistences to handle non stationary and non linearity data such linear models are still applicable because a traditional linear models are economical uncomplicated and the natural phenomenon can be employed in a functional linear system b non linear models magnify the noise for additional time steps while the linear models increase the noise included in the data linearly therefore applying the traditional linear model for linear portions of the process is recommended the natural and real world processes may contain both the linear and non linear characteristic as such arima model is not capable of handling non linear system solely on the other hand an ai model may expand the noise of the linear pattern and therefore both of the models cannot adequately estimate the time series of the process individually hence by combining results of arima and ai models the magnify non linear behaviors of the noise and complex architecture can be addressed in a simple approach the objective of the proposed methodology in this study is to predict do time series of the yamuna river using different combinations of input parameters for this purpose 3 sl and four different black box models are considered and then the outputs of the single models are calibrated within the ensemble techniques the mathematical expression to model do at different stations can be written as 1 d o t 1 1 f d o t 1 d o t n 1 w t t 1 q t 1 d o t 1 2 f d o t 2 d o t n 2 w t t 2 q t 2 q t 1 d o t 1 d o t 1 3 f d o t 3 d o t n 3 w t t 3 q t 3 q t 2 d o t 2 in eq 1 upper index denotes to the station member sl1 sl2 and sl3 and lower index stands for the time step according to the autoregressive property of the process and the effluent of each station on the downstream do value at each station may be consider as a function of q and do at upper stream station wt and do values at previous time steps as eq 1 in order to do multi step ahead modeling of do the target output at k time step ahead could be presented as 2 s l 1 d o t k 1 f d o t 1 d o t n 1 w t t 1 q t 1 s l 2 d o t k 2 f d o t 2 d o t n 2 w t t 2 q t 2 q t 1 d o t 1 s l 3 d o t k 3 f d o t 3 d o t n 3 w t t 3 q t 3 q t 2 d o t 2 the trial and error procedure may be applied to determine the lag time n t n the proposed methodology of the study is schematically described in fig 2 2 3 back propagation neural network bpnn bpnn which is known as multi layer feed forward neural network ffnn is the most widely used ann training usually by lavenberg marquardt algorithm asce 2000 fig 3 shows the architecture of the bpnn used in this study the functions of nonlinear processing elements are summing up the incoming information and generate the outputs which are propagated backwards until the required target is achieved nourani et al 2017 in this network all the neurons are connected by terms with variable weights the main concept of bpnn is that the weight is adjusted through the mean square error of the output until error is minimized so that the network can learn the training data asce 2000 2 4 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis an adaptive network based fuzzy inference system anfis as ai based model developed by jang in 1993 anfis has the ability to overcome the limitations of fuzzy inference and ann anfis model combines the ability of both ann and fuzzy logic to create a process that has the ability of handling complex non linear interactions between a set of input and output the general structure of an anfis can be shown in fig 4 anfis provides promising capability in the prediction and forecasting of river hydro climatology and reservoir modeling due to the integration and ability of fuzzy to handle uncertainty and the strength of ann jang 1993 kisi 2009 solgi et al 2017 assuming x y are the input and f is the output of a fuzzy inference system the first order sugeno type as the following rules eqs 3 and 4 3 rule 1 i f μ x i s a 1 a n d μ y i s b 1 t h e n f 1 p 1 x q 1 y r 1 4 rule 2 i f μ x i s a 2 a n d μ y i s b 2 t h e n f 2 p 2 x q 2 y r 2 for a given inputs x and y the membership function are indicated as a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 outlet functions parameters are p 1 q 1 r 1 p 2 q 2 r 2 the structural formula and arrangement of 5 layer anfis are as followed layer 1 the node function of this layer as in eq 5 is an adaptive node i 5 q i 1 μ ai x for i 1 2 or q i 1 μ bi x for i 3 4 q i 1 stands for membership grade for x and y inputs and the selected membership function was gaussian membership function because it reduces the error in the prediction process layer 2 each input layer is links with an operator called t norm that is accomplished with and operator as eq 6 6 q i 2 w i μ ai x μ bi y for i 1 2 layer 3 the output in this layer is known as normalized firing strength and each node is labelled as norm 7 q i 3 w i w i w 1 w 2 i 1 2 layer 4 in this layer each node i performs the subsequence rules as an adaptive node 8 q i 4 w i p i x q i y r i w i f i p 1 q 1 r 1 are irregular parameters referred to as consequent parameters layer 5 the product of all the incoming signals are computed for the overall output layers as eq 9 9 q i 5 w i p i x q i y r i i w i f i i w i f i i w i 2 5 support vector machine svm support vector machine svm as the ai based model that is capable of providing the satisfactory solutions to the problems of regression prediction classification and pattern recognitions nourani et al 2018 svm was first introduced by cortes and vapnik 1995 with two important functions such as statistical learning theory and structural risk minimization that distinct it from other ai based models the svm model are capable of minimizing the complexity and noise error in the structures and also enhance the generalization performance of the network therefore svm is based on the two basic structural layers first layer is kernel function weighting on the input parameters and the weighted sum of kernel outputs is the second function granata et al 2017 in svm linear sigmoid polynomial and radial basis function rbf are the four alternative methods used as kernel function the kernel rbf was applied in this study due to its robustness to simulate complex nonlinear function wang et al 2013a b in svm model the data set is close fitted inform of linear regression and subsequently the non linear kernel converts the resulting linear outputs using non linear pattern of the data the calibration data is given as x i d i i n xi is the input vector di is the actual value and n is sum of the data the overall svm function is given as 10 y f x w ϕ x i b where φ xi indicates feature spaces non linearly mapped from input vector x cortes and vapnik 1995 11 minimize 1 2 w 2 c i n ξ i ξ i subject to w i ϕ x i b i d i ε ξ i d i w i ϕ x i b i ε ξ i ξ i ξ i i 1 2 n where 1 2 w 2 is the weights vector norm and c is referred to the regularized constant the general conceptual model structure of svm is illustrated in fig 5 the problems of dual quadratic optimization can be addressed by alteration process of optimization in which the parameters of lagrange multipliers are defined αi and αi vector w in eq 12 can be calculated after finding the problem solution of optimization nourani et al 2018 12 w i 1 n α i α i ϕ x i therefore the overall form of svm can be inform of eq 15 13 f x α i α i i 1 n α i α i k x x i b where k xi xj is the kernel function and b is bias term the radial basis function gaussian is the most common kernel function and is expressed as haghiabi et al 2017 14 k x 1 x 2 exp γ x 1 x 2 2 where γ is the kernel parameter 2 6 auto regressive integrated moving average arima arima has been one of the most popular classic models for time series forecasting known as box and jenkins model faruk 2010 arima model can be categorized by various classifications of time series such as autoregressive ar moving average ma and combined ar and ma arma series the major drawback of arima is pre assumption of linear model kavasseri and seetharaman 2009 the three iterative stages used in arima modeling are estimation of parameters diagnostic checking and identifying model the time series data must be checked to be stationary in the model identification stage as it is essential in creating an arima model in order to identify the order of arima model autocorrelation function acf and partial autocorrelation function pacf have been proposed by box et al 1976 to calibrate the model the best fitted models are chosen by considering the minimum error efficiency and the three main steps for building the model is iterated until the desire model is obtained faruk 2010 2 7 performance efficiency criteria the various statistical measures can be used to assessed the performance efficiency of the model including determination coefficient dc or r2 root mean square error rmse mean absolute relative error mare mean absolute error mae agreement index d standard error of prediction sep according to legates and mccabe 1999 the model efficiency performance should include at least one goodness of fit e g dc and at least one absolute error measure e g rmse therefore in order to assess the predicting efficiency of the models dc and rmse were employed in this study as nourani et al 2011 15 dc 1 i 1 n do obs i do com i 2 i 1 n do obs i do obs 2 16 rmse i 1 n do obs i do com i 2 n where n do do obs and d o co m i are data number measured do average value of the measured do and computed do value respectively dc ranges between and 1 with a perfect score of 1 2 8 ensemble learning it is clear that single models e g ai based models produce different performances for same inputs based on the robustness or limitations hence ensemble modeling could effectively improve the general performance of the time series prediction ensemble methods have been already applied in some fields of science such as web ranking algorithm classification and clustering of time series and regression problems sharghi et al 2018 this study employed three ensemble techniques in order to improve the predicting performance of single models as a simple averaging ensemble sae b weighted averaging ensemble wae and c the non linear neural network ensemble nne 2 8 1 technique 1 simple averaging ensemble sae in this technique bpnn anfis svm and arima models are employed separately and then sae output is generated by averaging the outputs of all the single models 2 8 2 technique 2 weighted average ensemble wae this technique is employed by applying various weights to the outputs of the individual model s outputs based on the relative significant of the outputs the basic difference between sae and wae is that the assigned weight of wae to each variable is based on the relative significance unlike the case of sae where equal weights are assigned to all outputs nourani et al 2018 the weighted averaging ensemble technique is expressed as 17 d o t i 1 n w i d o t i where w i is the assigned weight on output of the ith model do t is ensemble output d o i t is the output of ith single model here outputs of bpnn anfis svm and arima and n is the number of single models here n 4 where w i can be computed as 18 w i d c i i n d c i where d c i is the determination coefficient for it h model 2 8 3 technique 3 non linear neural network ensemble nne an bpnn is employed to perform the non linear averaging nne in neural ensemble technique the outputs of the single models are considered to form the input layer of the neural ensemble each of which is assigned to one neuron in the input layer fig 6 presents the schematic of the nne method the procedure of neural ensemble is like that of single bpnn the best architecture and iteration number of the neural ensemble network can be obtained using trial error procedure and the sigmoid may be consider as hidden and output activation function it is worth mentioning that other nonlinear models e g svm anfis may also be used as the kernel of the non linear ensemble prediction instead of bpnn but bpnn was used in this study due to the facts that it s the most commonly used ai method that could lead to outstanding performance in various studies asce 2000 3 results and discussion the bpnn anfis svm and arima models were separately used to predict do at three different sample stations along yamuna river and their performances in calibration and verification steps were examined and compared on the basis of different input combinations 3 1 results of prediction by single models in bpnn modeling the maximum number of iterations mean square error and learning rate were initially set as 1000 0 0001 and 0 01 respectively for the hidden and output layers log sigmoid and purlin were respectively found to be the optimum activation functions in order to construct the best model appropriate number of hidden nodes is essential aspect as too many neurons may lead to overfitting while insufficient neurons may capture unsatisfactory information olyaie et al 2017 according to fletcher and goss 1993 proper number of nodes in the hidden layer ranges from 2n1 2 m to 2n 1 for identification of optimum number of hidden layers where n is the number of input neurons and m is the number of output neurons hence 5 21 was found to be the range of the hidden neurons of typical three layer bpnn model for the prediction of do at three stations of yamuna river the obtained results for the best models for single step modeling are shown in table 3 based on the dc values in the verification phase bpnn performance for stations is in the order of sl2 0 8149 sl3 0 7259 sl1 0 6830 in the anfis modeling different types of membership functions mfs were examined by trial and error to determine the best anfis structure each structure is formed by mf and various epoch iterations table 3 shows the best performance results of single step ahead modeling of anfis for three stations from the obtained results for single step modeling by anfis it can be seen that the results of verification performance of anfis for stations is in the order of sl2 0 9276 sl3 0 8327 sl1 0 7036 different types of svm model structures were detected for all input combinations in order to achieve the best accuracy in the development of svm model the determination of the optimal combination of c and g parameters is highly essential hence grid search method was employed to find out the optimal values granata et al 2017 table 3 depicts the obtained results for the best models for single step modeling by the svm based on the results of the verification phase the performance of svm for stations is in the order of sl3 0 9087 sl2 0 7532 sl1 0 6444 in arima model the optimal parameters were chosen using different trial and error procedures as in the case of ai based models in this study the traditional arima model was developed using time series forecasting tool of eviews software 9 5 the obtained results for the best ai and arima models for single step modeling are shown in table 3 according to table 3 anfis model emerged to be more satisfactory for the prediction of do for all stations which was proved by its high values of dc and low values of rmse fig 7 shows the time series of observed versus predicted do for the best simulated models during the verification phase for sl1 sl2 and sl3 among the models ai based models anfis svm and bpp are more robust than the linear model arima which shows the complex and nonlinear behavior of the process generally the performance of the models can be attributed to the following the sl1 is located downstream from yamunotri and slight pollution in biological water quality is observed at the locations which can significantly impact on the catchment water bodies of sl1 in table 1 it can be seen that all the variables exceeded the prescribe limit of world health organization and environmental protection agency for sl1 in addition wq at this location was not fit for domestic purposes owing to the influence of most chemical parameters as reported by taskeena et al 2017 high or low ph value in a river affects its biota impede recreational uses of water and alter the toxicity of other pollutants in one form or the other therefore the health of the river and aquatic system are affected this conclusion is in consistent with the research conducted at sl1 by parmar and bhardwaj 2014 to estimate monthly wq variables using arima and statistical analysis the results concluded that all the parameters except ph and wt crossed the prescribed limits of who it can be concluded that modeling the do at this location is very crucial due to the fact that yamuna river enters delhi capital of india and account for more than 70 of delhi s water supplies parmar and bhardwaj 2014 the reasonable outcome of the anfis model is due to the ability of anfis to handle uncertainties of the process according to table 1 it can be seen that the mean of do level at sl2 was very low due to high anthropogenic activities that could lead to septic and eutrophic conditions in addition the location depicted a high level of pollution which is primarily due to wastewater discharge from delhi this deteriorates the yamuna river to an alarming extent thereby causing complex physical chemical and biological interactions in the water bodies and hence leading to substantial interactions among the wq parameters this finding corresponds with that pointed by sharma and kansal 2011 to predict water quality index wqi using ccme wqi index the obtained results showed that the wqi fell under poor category at sl2 moreover bod cod and nh3 were found to be critical parameters similarly kumar et al 2005 reported that the major causes of degradation at sl2 are excessive used of domestic and industrial waste leading to low flow at sl2 to sl3 the low flow condition prevalent over a considerable portion of the station and its tributaries have seriously impacted the entire yamuna river the physical and chemical characteristics of water at sl3 show that water is almost are pollution free in this station according to table 1 few parameters show higher recorded values and slightly above the standard limit indicating temporary sign of pollution which may be due to some localized affects the wq at sl3 fairly satisfies the wq criteria for drinking water source after conventional treatment and disinfection the overall health of the river in sl3 has been found satisfactory in which do serves as major indicator hence continues monitoring is useful for the sustainable development through the application of ai based models in order to mitigate the adverse effects of the deprived quality of river water on human health as well as on plant growth the efficiency of multi step ahead predictions of do by anfis bpnn svr and arima models are also presented in table 3 from the table 3 it is clear that by increasing the prediction horizon the modeling accuracy is decreased for further investigation of the models performances at different time spans the predicted values that are closer to observed values implied better performance for examples for two sample points i and ii in fig 7c the details justify that at sample point i the do predictions by the methods were 0 58 0 53 0 49 and 0 45 for bpnn svm arima and anfis respectively whereas for point ii they were 0 62 0 49 0 47 and 0 453 for svm anfis bpnn and arima this proves that the performances of the methods may be different at various spans of the time series as such it is logical to ensemble the outcomes of different methods in order to come up with more accurate prediction results 3 2 results of ensemble predictions in order to improve the overall prediction accuracy of single models the ensemble of outputs of bpnn anfis svm and arima models were carried out based on the three proposed ensemble techniques table 4 depicts the obtained results of sae wae and nne techniques for single and multistep ahead predictions the obtained values of rmse and dc indicate reliable improvement in modeling performance with regards to the single models this performance could be due to the accuracy of each single model it can be seen from table 4 that at sl1 sae wae and nne increased the efficiency performance of the best ai modeling up to 8 10 and 17 respectively in the verification phase for sl2 nne increased the performance of the best ai modeling up to 14 while for anfis outperformed sae and wae by approximately 9 in verification phase this could be due the inability of sae and wae techniques to undergo another process of black box learning unlike the nne finally for sl3 nne and wae increased the performance up to 14 and 8 respectively while svm proved high merit with regards to sae by 8 improvement in the verification phase see table 4 this increase in percentage of efficiency by the ensemble techniques could be due to the integration of single outputs which handle the overall weaknesses of single models fig 8 a c show the scatter plots of computed do by nne versus observed values for sl1 sl2 and sl3 respectively according to the obtained results presented in table 4 the nne outperformed the two ensemble techniques due to the robustness to coup with complex non linear process between inputs and outputs also the obtained ensemble results of multi step ahead for dot 1 dot 3 and dot 5 model show that nne led to average increased up to 9 and 7 with regard to sae and wae at sl1 and up to an average of 8 for both sae and wae techniques at sl2 and up to 10 and 8 for sl3 the better performance of wae over sae could be attributed to the fact that the weights are assigned on the parameters based on the relative importance on the other hand the three ensemble techniques sae wae and nne were also evaluated based on the two dimensional graphical diagram i e taylor diagram that vividly exhibits the observed and predicted values yaseen et al 2019 taylor diagram was used as the recommended diagram for accuracy comparison zhu et al 2019 the combination of two metrics including standard deviation sd and correlation r were constructed to be visualized graphically as a taylor diagram fig 9 taylor 2001 the main target of this diagram is to summarizes multiple performance metrics in one combination and statistically quantifies the degree of similarity between the observed actual do and the predicted values however it is clearly seen that at sl1 the best performance results for sae wae and nne are dot 5 r 0 9001 dot 1 r 0 9208 and dot 3 r 0 9517 respectively similarly for sl2 the results can be arrange as dot 3 r 0 9440 dot 1 r 0 9377 and dot 3 r 0 978928 for sae wae and nne respectively lastly for sl3 the best performance accuracy is attained with dot 3 0 9360 dot 5 0 9594 and dot 5 0 9876 for sae wae and nne respectively from the comparison of the results the mentioned indictor denotes the extent of accuracy of prediction for nne hence nne outperformed other techniques because the observed points are closer to the computed points this can be also affirmed by considering the high value of sd which could be attributed to the nne generally if the sd of the computed values is higher than the sd of observed values then it will result in overestimation and vice versa it is worth mentioning that the profiles of wq parameters are entirely different for each sample station different data profiles and characteristics of data make the model results different even for the same data set different models may exhibit different results due to unique nature of each model due to the importance of the do this parameter was modeled in this study but similar method in the case of the data availability can be used to model other wq parameters 4 conclusions the main aim of this paper was to develop single and multi step ahead prediction models for do as an important wq parameter at three different stations on yamuna river in india using ai based ensemble techniques the do was predicted by different ai models bpnn anfis and svm and a traditional linear model arima next three ensemble techniques were employed to enhance the prediction performance of the single models by evaluating different input combinations and structures it was concluded that at sl1 anfis led to better results in verification phase up to 6 8 and 13 with regards to bpnn svm and arima models respectively for sl2 the obtained results again indicated that anfis model was superior to other models with about 11 17 and 30 for bpp svm and arima respectively however for sl3 the results showed that svm could led to better results in the verification phase up to 7 18 and 23 with regards bpnn anfis and arima models respectively in multi step ahead modeling the performance criteria justified capability of ai based models for do prediction at all stations different outputs of the single models at different time spans confirmed the need to ensemble the outputs of the single models in this regard 2 linear sae and wae and one nonlinear nne ensemble techniques were applied to enhance the predictions for ensemble techniques nne led to better result up to 12 and 9 respectively with regard to sae and wae at sl1 and up to 7 for both sae and wae at sl2 and up to 10 and 8 for sl3 also the obtained ensemble results of multi step ahead for dot 3 and dot 5 model show that nne could lead to average improvement of efficiency up to 9 and 7 with regard to sae and wae at sl1 and up to an average of 8 for both sae and wae at sl2 and up to 10 and 8 for sl3 however for all the three stations nne should be considered as the most robust and reliable ensemble technique due to its nonlinear kernel for prediction of do

6249,frequent droughts in a warming climate may exert more negative influences on ecosystems unlike previous studies that have investigated the vegetation response to drought generally in a deterministic way a copula based model is developed for quantifying drought impacts on terrestrial vegetation and identifying drought vulnerable regions for mainland china from a probabilistic perspective in this study the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is firstly correlated with the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei at varying timescales from 1 month to 24 months to determine the response time of vegetation to water variability then the dependence structure of vegetation vigor and water availability is modeled through the bivariate copula analysis furthermore conditional probabilities of vegetation decline under moderate severe and extreme drought scenarios are systematically estimated using copula based conditional probability distributions results indicate that spatial patterns of vegetation response time present distinct seasonality with faster response to water variation in the southern part than in the northern proportion of mainland china during the non growing season while the inverse pattern is observed for the growing season the higher conditional probabilities of the below average vegetation status in the dry condition evidence that water deficits overwhelming water surplus play a more profound role in diminishing vegetation vigor across more than 80 of mainland china specifically when moderate droughts develop into extreme ones the average probability of vegetation status below the 50th percentile escalates by 6 9 moreover extreme droughts are noted to exaggerate probabilities of vegetation activity falling below the increasingly lower 40th 30th 20th and 10th percentiles by 8 8 10 8 12 7 and 13 7 in comparison with moderate counterparts thereby suggesting higher likelihood of the deteriorating drought conditions inducing vegetation losses especially major vegetation decline as for the drought vulnerable region north china particularly the central inner mongolia is recognized with vegetation decline probabilities being 28 1 and 68 8 greater than the mainland average given drought conditions quantified as spei 1 respectively results of the study may improve our understanding of climatic extreme influence on vegetation status and benefit the effective drought preparedness and mitigation keywords vegetation vigor water balance copula analysis conditional probability drought vulnerable region 1 introduction the frequency of droughts is intensifying worldwide in the current context of a warming climate and is projected to increase in forthcoming decades by climate models dai 2011 schwalm et al 2017 sheffield and wood 2008 touma et al 2015 frequent and intense droughts tend to induce the vegetation decline crop yield reduction land degradation forest fire hot extremes and dampened hydropower generation delbiso et al 2017 fang et al 2017 hao et al 2017 li et al 2019 madadgar et al 2017 turco et al 2017 wilhite et al 2007 amongst diverse natural and human systems sensitive to water deficits terrestrial ecosystems have pronounced and complicated interactions with drought conditions as water is involved in all major physiological processes of vegetation seed germination photosynthesis respiration transpiration mineral absorption growth etc persistent water deficits over a sustained period can adversely impact vegetation functioning resulting in the slow growth mohammat et al 2013 reduced greenness xu et al 2011a biomass decline huang and anderegg 2012 and even vegetation die off zeppel et al 2013 determined by the resistance and resilience of diverse vegetation species to drought in turn the reduced vegetation vigor under drought stress leads to weaker photosynthetic activity and less carbon sequestration from the atmosphere what s worse when droughts induce massive biomass decline and vegetation mortality vegetation carbon can be subsequently decomposed by microbes into inorganic carbon and reenter the atmosphere which may have unpredictable consequences for the global carbon cycle since terrestrial vegetation is a main carbon pool on the earth the reduction in carbon uptake coupled with the gain of atmospheric carbon from faded organic matter implies that aboveground vegetation subject to severe drought stress could be turned into a significant carbon source contributing to more positive climate carbon cycle feedbacks that are expected to further aggravate drought conditions ciais et al 2005 friedlingstein et al 2006 therefore quantifying the negative impacts of drought on vegetation and identifying drought vulnerable areas are crucial for improving our understanding of the vegetation vulnerability to climate change and initiating effective mitigation actions evaluating drought impacts on terrestrial vegetation is primarily challenged by difficulties in drought quantification and the synthetic response of vegetation activity to an ensemble of climatic and anthropogenic factors droughts are difficult to quantify in time and space for the following reasons 1 a drought usually identified by its effects on diverse systems agriculture ecosystem and human society is not universally defined 2 the slow development of drought makes it hard to determine its onset and end 3 its impacts spread over a very large geographic area huang et al 2019 wilhite 2000 as for influential factors of vegetation activity water availability is known as one of the dominant constraints for the growth additionally vegetation variability can arise from changes in air temperature solar radiation floods pest infestation wildfire irrigation grazing fertilizer application and crop rotation ashourloo et al 2014 coop et al 2016 džubáková et al 2015 ji and peters 2003 ren et al 2019 wang et al 2015a weng et al 2004 previous studies concerning drought quantification mainly depended on various drought indices physically based models and water balance simulations a drought index assimilates a large amount of water supply information in a statistical framework and quantifies the deviation of accumulated moisture conditions from the long term average an attractive advantage of the use of drought indices over the other two alternatives is its convenience of deriving drought duration intensity and influential extent thus allowing diverse users to communicate drought information more efficiently by far different drought indices have been developed for natural and human systems of concern commonly used indices for drought monitoring comprise the palmer drought severity index pdsi liu et al 2017b palmer 1965 the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 the standardized soil moisture index ssi narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 the standardized runoff index sri huang et al 2017 shukla and wood 2008 and the multivariate standardized drought index msdi brown et al 2008 guo et al 2019 hao and aghakouchak 2014 meantime the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi obtained using satellite remote sensing and tree ring width series acquired from the ground observation are two important data sources available for characterizing the terrestrial vegetation changes and interpreting effects of climatic extremes on the biosphere liu et al 2018 benefiting from the use of drought and vegetation indices as proxies for drought and vegetation conditions previous efforts to assess drought impacts on vegetation activity have usually been simplified into examining correlations between drought indices and ndvi or tree ring series bento et al 2018 gouveia et al 2017 jain et al 2010 wu et al 2015 the strong association between drought indices and vegetation vigor indicators mainly the ndvi and tree ring series indicates significant drought impacts and vice versa the assessment of drought effects on terrestrial vegetation has been conducted across many parts of the globe for example ji and peters 2003 reported in the northern u s great plains the pronounced correlation between the ndvi and precipitation anomaly since approximately 67 and 58 of the crop and grass ndvi changes can be explained by the spi variations and seasonality using a linear regression model it is also found by a group of studies that the relationship between moisture availability and vegetation activity varies spatially and temporally in semiarid and arid areas vegetation status is more correlated with the moisture availability than in humid areas it means the higher sensitivity of biomes to drought stress in the former areas gouveia et al 2017 pasho et al 2011 vicente serrano 2007 humid areas are usually characterized by the positive water balance precipitation minus reference evapotranspiration where biomes are therefore less determined by drought as compared with those in arid ones vicente serrano et al 2013 temporally the growing season is the center of attention the highest ndvi correlations with precipitation anomaly are noted in the middle of the growing season as compared with lower associations occurring at the beginning and end of the growing season ji and peters 2003 drought impacts varying as a function of the month of a year are partially attributed to remarkable changes in water requirement at different stages of plant growth and maturity salter 1967 further defined a moisture sensitive period which corresponds to the time of developing reproductive organs water shortage during the moisture sensitive period is considered to most adversely influence the plant size and yield it is therefore increasingly highlighted by recent studies the necessity of taking into consideration the seasonal timing when quantifying drought impacts on vegetation activity fang et al 2019a gouveia et al 2017 mina et al 2016 souza 2016 in addition to the correlation amplitude the drought timescale at which the highest correlation is recorded has also been receiving much attention the drought timescale or the response time refers to the time delay existing between the starting of a water deficit and the recognition of its consequences emphasizing that drought impacts do not occur instantaneously but are results of moisture deficits accumulated over a period of time humid and arid vegetation is observed to respond to drought at short timescales i e the rapid response vicente serrano 2013 zhang et al 2010c in comparison there exists longer response time i e the lagged response in sub humid and semiarid areas where vegetation regularly subject to short periods of water deficits has evolved physiological mechanisms to tolerate adverse conditions pasho et al 2011 in fact the response time measures both of how fast vegetation is adversely affected by the drought episode and how fast it recovers from the drought disturbance thereby being able to to some extent quantify the resistance and resilience of vegetation to drought van hoek et al 2016 vicente serrano et al 2013 previous studies on the drought impact assessment were accustomed to the use of the spi for drought characterization due to its low data requirements and computational simplicity the spi is calculated merely using precipitation data while neglecting the influence of other meteo climatic variables on drought development beguería et al 2014 stagge et al 2015 the use of spi is justified under the assumption that other variables are relatively stationary and precipitation anomalies are significantly higher than those of other variables vicente serrano et al 2010 however the global warming reminds a general increase in air temperature worldwide which can exacerbate drought conditions by increasing the atmospheric evaporative demand shukla et al 2015 vicente serrano et al 2014 williams et al 2013 vegetation activity is also known to be more sensitive to water balance precipitation minus reference evapotranspiration rather than water supply alone beer et al 2007 piedallu et al 2013 it is therefore more reasonable to include the role of temperature in drought monitoring especially under a warming climate in order to present a reliable drought vegetation activity relationship besides previous efforts were limited to dealing with drought impacts in a deterministic way and results are provided with the specific focus on how closely the vegetation variability is associated with drought conditions and how fast vegetation responds to water deficits in areas of interest in contrast ecologists decision makers and crop producers also prefer an elaborated model that produces probability distributions of vegetation losses conditioned on drought events which are projected to happen in the upcoming growing season to this end this study is intended to advance a further step to present a bivariate probabilistic model for quantifying drought impacts on terrestrial vegetation dynamics mainly dependent on 1 identifying the response time of vegetation activity represented by the ndvi to variability in water balance represented by the spei by means of the correlation analysis 2 describing the dependence structure between water balance and vegetation vigor through the bivariate copula analysis 3 estimating the occurrence probabilities of the below normal vegetation status under three namely moderate severe and extreme drought scenarios using copula based conditional probability distributions a case study is conducted over mainland china results may improve our understanding of climatic determinants of terrestrial vegetation and assist decision makers in the recognition of drought vulnerable areas from a probabilistic perspective which have important implications for taking appropriate actions to mitigate vegetation stress 2 study area and data mainland china as shown by statistics has frequently suffered from droughts during the second half of the twentieth century largely as a result of the variability in the asian monsoons and westerly circulations as well as the complicated landform qian et al 2011 xu et al 2015 particularly severe droughts in north china plain in 1968 1972 1983 1997 and 2015 yellow river basin in 1965 1972 1980 and 1997 and southwest china in 2006 and 2009 induced large agricultural economic and societal losses therefore it is the practical need to assess drought impacts on natural and human systems over mainland china with specific attention given to terrestrial vegetation in this study mainland china 72 e 36 e 18 n 54 n fig 1 is located in the east asian monsoon climate zone where precipitation and air temperature present distinct monthly annual and interannual changes huang et al 2014a spatially climates of mainland china vary across its vast territory and diverse landscape liu et al 2017a the northern and western portions are dominated by arid climates while the southern and eastern territory has the semi humid and humid climates yu et al 2014 the climate difference forms strong south north gradients in the total annual precipitation and the mean annual temperature ranging from 3266 5 mm to 0 5 mm and from 27 c to 22 c respectively fig 1 a depicts a vegetation type map of mainland china dependent on a dataset provided by the data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences resdc mainland china from the south to the north is dominantly covered by the forest cultivated vegetation shrub and pasture also provided in fig 1 b is the regionalization of the study area based on the mean annual precipitation the monthly precipitation air temperature and ndvi are jointly used for drought impact analysis the gridded monthly precipitation and temperature during the analysis period 1982 2014 are retrieved from the national meteorological information center of china http data cma cn at a 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution han et al 2019 liu et al 2019b observations of 2472 national level gauges covering mainland china were interpolated by means of the thin plate splines to generate the gridded datasets data

utilized to calculate the spei at multiple timescales varying from 1 month to 24 months for drought monitoring with respect to the ndvi series for characterizing vegetation activity we use the dataset developed by the global inventory modeling and mapping studies gimms group https climatedataguide ucar edu climate data ndvi normalized difference vegetation index 3rd generation nasagfsc gimms tucker et al 2005 over the same analysis period from 1982 to 2014 the biweekly gimms ndvi dataset with an 8 km 8 km spatial resolution is the most complete and longest available from 1982 ndvi data source globally bento et al 2018 liu et al 2019a it was created from the daily 1 1 km 1 1 km avhrr images as the biweekly maximum value composites and corrected for sensor degradation and orbital drift in order to match the temporal and spatial resolution of precipitation and temperature data the biweekly 14 day gimms ndvi images are further aggregated through the maximum value composite mvc algorithm to generate the monthly ndvi series with a 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution 3 methods drought impact assessment is performed within a bivariate probabilistic model shown in fig 2 main building blocks of the model including the spei ndvi and copula theory are outlined in the method section 3 1 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei the spei is used by the study for drought identification and characterization the widely used spi accounting for the abnormal water deficits based only on precipitation anomalies emphasizes the precipitation as the dominant forcing for drought variability however the profound role of air temperature in drought development has been observed among well known droughts occurring in europe vicente serrano et al 2014 east asia xu et al 2015 and western united states diffenbaugh et al 2015 and is projected by general circulation models to grow under a global warming scenario williams et al 2013 the physical mechanism of higher temperature exacerbating the water stress is that the consequent increase in evaporation demand caused by higher temperature can drive the water balance i e the difference between precipitation and reference evapotranspiration increasingly towards the lower value even though the precipitation received remains invariant aware of the potential deficiency of applying the spi under global warming conditions vicente serrano et al 2010 improved the index formulation by additionally including the temperature which is represented by reference evapotranspiration and developed a novel drought index spei the spei is based on the concept of water supply and demand measuring the deviation of water balance from the long term mean water balance d in the spei is defined as 1 d p e t 0 in which p and e t 0 represent the monthly precipitation and reference evapotranspiration vicente serrano and beguería 2010 2014 recommended the use of the thornthwaite equation thornthwaite 1948 for the e t 0 calculation because the equation merely requires the mean monthly temperature and latitude as inputs which can be available at the global scale fang et al 2018 the rest procedure for the spei calculation is much the same as that of spi the obtained water balance is then aggregated at timescales of particular interest usually 1 3 6 12 and 24 months a three parameter log logistic distribution is fitted to the aggregated water balance for each calendar month individually finally an equiprobability transformation is performed to convert the log logistic distribution to the standard normal distribution this yields a standardized spei series with the mean of zero and a standard deviation of one which is comparable over time and space according to different thresholds dry and wet conditions are categorized by the spei as follows extremely wetness spei 2 severe wetness 1 5 spei 2 moderate wetness 1 spei 1 5 nearly normal condition 1 spei 1 moderate drought 1 5 spei 1 severe drought 2 spei 1 5 and extreme drought spei 2 the spei advantageously integrates the multi scalar characteristic similar to the spi with the sensitivity to evaporation variations resulting from the temperature fluctuation similar to the pdsi the multi scalar property of drought indices is essential to assess the response time of vegetation activity to drought conditions in this study the spei is calculated at multiple timescales ranging from 1 month to 24 months as illustrated in fig 2 the response time is defined as the timescale at which the maximum spei ndvi correlation is acquired gouveia et al 2017 pasho et al 2011 vicente serrano et al 2013 3 2 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi the ndvi the remote sensing data derived from the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr is commonly utilized as a reliable indicator of the presence growth and decline of terrestrial vegetation it exhibits high correlations with the leaf area index hasegawa et al 2010 wang et al 2005 total vegetation biomass le maire et al 2011 raynolds et al 2012 and fractional vegetation cover carlson and ripley 1997 jacquin et al 2010 the capability of the ndvi to quantify vegetation dynamics is closely related to the absorptive and reflective characteristics of vegetation in the near infrared and red bands of the electromagnetic spectrum tadesse et al 2005 healthy vegetation absorbs an important percentage of visible light for the use of photosynthesis thereby reflecting less solar radiation in the red band relative to that in the near infrared band jain et al 2010 in contrast the avhrr onboard the noaa satellites will receive increased radiation in the red band and decreased near infrared radiation from places where vegetation is under stress the ndvi is defined as 2 ndvi ρ nir ρ red ρ nir ρ red where ρ red and ρ nir denote the reflected radiation in the red and near infrared bands respectively the use of avhrr ndvi presents several advantages over the ground based observations including that i the ndvi has the high spatial resolution of 1 12 ii the avhrr instrument provides twice daily global coverage iii the biweekly ndvi database routinely updated by the noaa can be freely available 3 3 copula based method for estimating conditional probabilities of vegetation decline in different drought conditions the proposed bivariate probabilistic model is utilized to describe the complicated dependence structure between drought conditions represented by the spei and the vegetation activity represented by the ndvi the results are presented in the form of the joint distribution of the spei and the ndvi afterward the joint distribution is utilized to calculate conditional probabilities of vegetation decline to lower percentiles in multiple drought conditions e g the moderate severe and extreme droughts given the forecast of a water deficit in the near future one can thus derive the corresponding vegetation status distribution and estimate the probability of vegetation activity lower than a specific percentile in advance 3 3 1 joint probability distribution copula functions are employed to model the dependence of vegetation vigor on drought conditions assume x and y to be the spei and ndvi series their joint distribution f xy x y based on the copula function c with its independent variables being uniformly distributed on the interval 0 1 is formulated as follows 3 p x x y y f xy x y c f x x f y y where f x x and f y y are cumulative distribution functions cdfs of random variables x and y respectively note that f xy x y joins the original random variables namely x and y while the copula function c uses cdfs of x and y as independent variables madadgar et al 2017 some well defined bivariate distribution models e g the normal gamma beta and exponential types request that all random variables come from the same distributions nadarajah and kotz 2006 oh and suh 2017 olkin and trikalinos 2015 yue et al 2001 in comparison copula functions can flexibly connect two or more random variables having different kinds of marginals which has subsequently inspired the increasing applications of copulas in meteorological and hydrological studies bokusheva et al 2016 huang et al 2014b kwon and lall 2016 park et al 2017 more specifically the use of copula functions simplifies the formulation of joint distributions into the modeling of marginals and dependence structure fig 2 in this study four types of candidate distributions i e normal gamma logistic and log norm distributions are fitted to the monthly ndvi series as no consensus can be easily achieved on the most appropriate marginal from previous studies de beurs and henebry 2004 song 2005 wen et al 2012 the optimal marginal distributions are screened out based on the kolmogorov smirnov k s test and the akaike information criterion yu et al 2018a as stated in section 3 1 the spei is a normalized variable with the mean of zero and the standard deviation of one thereby the normal distribution is used as the marginal distribution of the spei series in regard to modeling the dependence structure between the ndvi and spei archimedean and elliptical copulas are considered which are two major copula families quite popular in the previous studies grimaldi et al 2016 yu et al 2018b zhou et al 2017 amongst six candidates listed in table 1 gaussian and student s t copulas come from the elliptical family and joe frank gumbel and clayton copulas are from the archimedean family zhao et al 2019 parameters of candidate copulas are estimated using the maximum likelihood method mle moreover a goodness of fit test based on the rosenblatt s transform genest et al 2009 is employed to select the best copula for the precise description of the ndvi dependence on the spei the one with the minimum cramér von mises statistic and the maximum p value is regarded as the most appropriate copula fang et al 2019b however it is worth noting that some previous studies have observed the negative spei ndvi correlations jain et al 2010 ji and peters 2003 vicente serrano 2007 wang et al 2015b while joe gumbel and clayton copulas are confined to accounting for the positive dependence in such cases the optimal one is screened out from gaussian student s t and frank copulas which are valid for dealing with both of the negative and positive spei ndvi dependence herein is presented an outline of how to use cupula functions to describe the dependence between two random variables for more details interested readers are referred to nelsen 2007 and genest and favre 2007 3 3 2 conditional distribution ecologists decision makers and crop producers often concern themselves with the likelihood of vegetation decline to the lower percentiles when drought events occur which is expressed as the conditional probability i e p y y x x from a statistical perspective the conditional probability can be estimated using the joint distribution formulated above and the drought classification by the spei in section 3 1 in this study droughts with diverse severity are considered including the moderate drought 1 5 spei 1 the severe drought 2 spei 1 5 and the extreme drought spei 2 thus conditional probabilities of the ndvi lower than a certain percentile y given three drought conditions are derived as follows 4 when moderate droughts occur p y y 1 5 x 1 p 1 5 x 1 y y p 1 5 x 1 f xy 1 y f xy 1 5 y f x 1 f x 1 5 5 when severe droughts occur p y y 2 x 1 5 p 2 x 1 5 y y p 2 x 1 5 f xy 1 5 y f xy 2 y f x 1 5 f x 2 6 when extreme droughts occur p y y x 2 p x 2 y y p x 2 f xy 2 y f x 2 where x and y denote the spei and ndvi respectively eqs 4 6 generally quantify the ndvi response to spei varying in a wide range in addition the occurrence probability of the deteriorating vegetation status given a specific value of the drought index i e p y y x x is also of interest according to the copula theory the conditional probability density function pdf of p y y x x is formulated as follows 7 f y x y x c f x x f y y f y y in which c u v c u v u v is defined as the first order derivative of the copula function c u v and f y y denotes the pdf of the ndvi once the pdf f y x y x conditional on a specific drought condition x x is derived using the equation 7 the conditional probability of the ndvi lower than a certain percentile p y y x x can be computed as the area under f y x y x for y y estimating probabilities of the deteriorating ndvi values conditional both on a wide spei range and on a particular spei value meantime benefits the assessment of drought impacts and the identification of drought vulnerable regions from a probabilistic perspective 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial pattern of spei ndvi correlations the ndvi is correlated with the spei at varying timescales from 1 month to 24 months to identify the response time of vegetation vigor to water variability given that vegetation usually responds to water variation accumulated over a period of time but not instantaneously the response time investigated here can be defined as the characteristic timescale at which the maximum spei ndvi correlation is acquired fig 3 shows the maximum pearson correlation coefficients in each pixel for twelve months for ease of analysis the whole year is divided into the growing season april october and the non growing season november december and january march when the spei ndvi relationship can show distinct spatial patterns in the non growing season spei ndvi correlations are observed to present less spatial variation across mainland china relative to those in the growing season terrestrial biomes in most parts of mainland china are positively correlated with water availability during the non growing season it is because mainland china in the non growing season is dominantly influenced by the east asian winter monsoon which brings much less moisture and water availability becomes a crucial factor in restraining vegetation vigor it is also noted that the much weaker or even negative spei ndvi correlations occur in some regions with higher latitudes including a large part of northeast china and the northwestern edge of the territory and lower latitudes including the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river mlyr and south china in the late autumn and early winter i e november and december the rapid and remarkable temperature drop which largely decreases the enzyme activity indispensable for various physiological processes of vegetation such as the photosynthesis and respiration is a primary driver responsible for the biomass decline in northeast china at relatively higher latitudes thus weakening the influence of water availability on vegetation status as for the mlyr and south china the reduction in vegetation greenness in november and december is more attributed to the crop harvest mainly the late rice instead of the water variability also resulting in the weaker spei ndvi association zhang et al 2010b 2014 when it comes to february and march vegetation in northeast china and the northwestern edge of the territory can start to recover as a direct consequence of the temperature rise and soil moisture gain from the snow and glacier melt even though only a little precipitation occurs therefore less dependence of the spring vegetation recovery on the precipitation is presented where there is additional soil moisture supply from the snowpack and glaciers likewise in a study conducted by gouveia et al 2017 for the mediterranean region the evidently weak spring ndvi spei correlations were noted in alpine and carpathian mountains where there was sufficient snow accumulation available for replenishing the soil moisture and highlighted that temperature rather than precipitation was a more significant determinant of vegetation status in spring in comparison the spei ndvi correlation in the growing season indicates the evident spatial heterogeneity which is characterized by much stronger correlations in the northern part of mainland china relative to those in the southern proportion the spatial difference is noticeable almost throughout the growing season may october while less observable at the beginning of the growing season april the border between areas with strong and weak spei ndvi correlations is observed especially from june to september to be in good agreement with the huai river and qinling mountain range routinely used to distinguish northern china and southern china according to different climate characteristics the northern part as shown in fig 1 b mainly comprises the sub humid 400 mm annual precipitation 800 mm semiarid 200 mm annual precipitation 400 mm and arid annual precipitation 200 mm regions of mainland china a close look at the northern part of china from fig 3 finds that north china and the loess plateau classified as sub humid and semiarid regions have higher correlation coefficients than the eastern and northern edges of northeast china the humid region and the middle and western proportions of northwest china the arid region in addition some negative spei ndvi correlations are noted in northeast china during august september and october which are ascribed to the crop harvest mainly the spring wheat and rice inducing decreased greenness even though increased precipitation is brought by the eastern asian summer monsoon with respect to the southern part of mainland china it is classified as the humid region annual precipitation 800 mm for the humid region a negative spei in the growing season when most of the total annual precipitation occurs does not necessarily suggest a water deficit because water balance may still keep positive fig 5 thus water variability in the growing season is not a crucial constraint on vegetation growth resulting in the weakened spei ndvi relationship in the southern part of mainland china compared with that in the northern part meantime it is interesting to notice that the spatial evolution of the negative spei ndvi association in the southern proportion follows the pathway of the monsoon rain belt the monsoon rain belt prevails in the growing season over mainland china arriving in south china in april moving northward to the mlyr and the huai river basin in late june proceeding towards north china and northeast china in early august and retreating southward to south china in october regions under the influence of the rain belt obviously get abundant rainfall while receiving less solar radiation due to cloud blockage a shortage of solar radiation can lead to a decrease in photosynthetic activity and adversely impact vegetation growth therefore it is deduced that during the growing season vegetation variations in regions which are in the control of the rain belt is primarily driven by solar radiation shortage and less dependent on water variability spatial pattern analysis of the spei ndvi relationship above reveals in the non growing season the unnoticeable spatial variation in positive dependence between vegetation status and water variability across mainland china in the growing season the obvious spatial heterogeneity is presented generally with the strong correlation in the northern part of mainland china and the weak linkage in the humid southern proportion results are in line with previous studies conducted at a global scale and in northern china by vicente serrano et al 2013 and xu et al 2018 who concluded that biomes in arid and semiarid regions are more responsive to water availability than those in sub humid and humid ones it is also found that vegetation status is the synthetic response to multiple factors including moisture condition air temperature solar radiation and anthropogenic intervention and changes in other related factors such as the crop harvest inducing the greenness decrease and the temperature decline and solar radiation shortage sufficient to hamper the physiological functioning may weaken the dependence of vegetation activity on water variability particularly during the growing season the weaker or even negative spei ndvi correlation in the southern part of mainland china evolves in space following the pathway of the monsoon rain belt which causes the reduction in solar radiation thus there can be moisture limited and solar radiation limited vegetation in northern and southern proportions during the growing season respectively 4 2 response time of vegetation activity to water variability fig 4 indicates the response time of vegetation activity to water deficits surplus which is defined as the spei timescale at which the maximum pearson correlation coefficient is recorded in the non growing season the response time varies markedly across mainland china vegetation generally tends to respond to water variation at longer timescales in the sub humid semiarid and arid regions of the northern territory than in the humid southern proportion of mainland china the difference in response time indicates that vegetation in diverse regions has different strategies to cope with water deficits in arid semiarid and sub humid regions vegetation is regularly subject to water shortage and has evolved physiological mechanisms including a more efficient water conservation system and deeper roots to adapt to adverse conditions related to water availability these physiological mechanisms can help to mitigate the negative influence of short term water shortage on vegetation activity thereby forming the vegetation response time at longer timescales in the aforementioned regions in contrast humid regions even though there is a negative spei are often characterized by positive water balance given the sufficient moisture supply vegetation in humid regions has relatively shallow root systems and lower water use efficiency as compared with that in the drier climates hence in the non growing season when much less precipitation occurs vegetation with low water use efficiency in humid regions is quite sensitive to water deficits cumulated over a short period of time the reasoning is supported by a finding by pasho et al 2011 in north eastern spain which highlighted the role of a more conservative water and deeper root system in mitigating the negative influence of short time water deficits on vegetation health it is also observed in fig 4 that in most of the northern part of mainland china especially in north china and the loess plateau the response time of vegetation to water variability starts to decline at the beginning of the growing season april and may whereas vegetation response time in the southern territory presents an ascending trend at the same time increasing and decreasing trends of vegetation response time in these two parts maintain till august resulting in a rapid response of vegetation in the northern part except for northeast china and delayed response of vegetation in the southern proportion respectively thus in strong contrast with the non growing season the middle of the growing season june august shows an inverse spatial pattern of vegetation response time across mainland china it is known that there is a remarkable change of water requirement at different stages of plant growth and maturity the faster response of vegetation to water stress in the northern part except for northeast china may be explained by the fact that when average water balance maintains negative during the growing season fig 5 an increasing amount of water required for the plant growth leaf enlargement reproduction and cooling can induce the enhanced sensitivity of vegetation activity to water deficits at shorter timescales in contrast with the northern part the southern proportion which acquires plenty of precipitation from the summer monsoon and typhoons has positive values of average water balance during the growing season see fig 5 positive water balance precipitation minus reference evapotranspiration cumulated over a period of time can contribute to an increase in soil moisture which alleviates the sensitivity of vegetation vigor to short term water deficits and make vegetation able to respond to water stress at longer timescales results coincide with a study by vicente serrano et al 2013 who observed the generally positive correlation of vegetation response time with water balance in the range of near zero which is just the case in mainland china the spatial pattern of response time revealed above shows that during the non growing season biomes in the northern part of mainland china respond to water variability at longer timescales relative to those in the southern part conversely the northern proportion except for northeast china has shorter response time than its southern counterpart in the growing season it should be noted that vegetation response time in this study is derived from the pearson correlation analysis which comprehensively quantifies linkages between vegetation reaction and water deficits surplus thus response time can be regarded as a useful indicator for assessing the vegetation resistance to drought and the resilience after the drought episode has terminated with its large value indicating a strong ability to withstand drought while a slow recovery rate from drought and vice versa 4 3 vegetation decline caused by water deficit and water surplus from a probabilistic perspective given the response time of vegetation to water variability identified above the joint distribution of vegetation status and water availability is modeled based on the monthly ndvi series and its most correlated spei series then the bivariate probabilistic analysis can be conducted in the following sections to quantify drought impacts on terrestrial vegetation using the copula based method described in section 3 3 pearson correlation analysis in section 4 1 provides evidence of the extent to which vegetation vigor is linked to both of water deficits and surplus however there is a lack of general knowledge about whether water deficits can surpass water surplus and plays a more profound role in diminishing vegetation vigor over mainland china thus this fundamental concern is dealt with in this section by comparing probabilities of ndvi less than the monthly average in dry and wet conditions for the month of interest prior to the specific investigation into impacts of different drought conditions such efforts are essential as they can reinforce the importance of the topic of this study in contrast to the non growing season the vigorous vegetation activity in the growing season largely determining the grain and biomass yields bolton and friedl 2013 lumbierres et al 2017 and diverse ecological benefits bonan 2008 becomes a high concern of crop producers ecologists and decision makers in relevant departments the growing season april october consists of large parts of spring and autumn and the entire summer however it is not easy to present results of drought impact assessment month by month for the ease of analysis three months showing the strongest spei ndvi associations in individual season are successively screened out from spring summer and autumn high values of the spei ndvi relation can necessarily imply that the ndvi changes keep pace with water variability in a close way it is also reasonable to deduce that the representative months having the ndvi in the closest relationship with the spei may be when ecosystems are most intensely affected by drought conditions in the corresponding seasons they are qualified to represent the most adverse situations that deserve adequate attention therefore analysis of drought impacts on vegetation is directed to months with the highest correlation coefficient in individual seasons in order to systematically compare the degree of the spi ndvi dependence among diverse months exceedance probabilities of different levels of the spei ndvi correlations are summarized from all pixels in the domain of mainland china and also scattered in fig 6 it is seen in fig 6 a that the spei ndvi correlations in may the red line have higher probabilities to exceed a given value as compared with those denoted by the blue line in april may thus represents the month with the stronger spei ndvi linkage in spring months of the growing season and are subsequently identified it is the same case for autumn months of the growing season fig 6 c giving rise to september the blue line being selected out in summer fig 6 b exceedance probability curves are twisted together which severs as the evidence of the very similar strength of the spei ndvi correlations in june july and august still june i e the blue line can present higher values of exceedance probability when correlation coefficients in a wide range are investigated june is therefore considered to have the slightly closer ndvi spei linkage among summer months in this way may june and september are identified as representative months for spring summer and autumn afterward conditional probabilities of ndvi smaller than the monthly average ndv i ave in the dry condition spei 0 5 and in the wet condition spei 0 5 are computed for may june and september respectively fig 7 indicates the difference in below average vegetation condition probabilities under dry and wet conditions expressed as p ndvi n d v i ave spei 0 5 p ndvi n d v i ave spei 0 5 in which a positive value implies that vegetation decline is more likely triggered by water deficits than by water surplus and vice versa counting up pixels with the positive probability difference explains that roughly 80 9 of mainland china in may has a higher likelihood of suffering from reduced vegetation activity in the dry condition than in the wet condition the territory where vegetation decline is more related to water deficits than water surplus climbs up to 88 4 and 85 1 in june and september therefore in the growing season the dry condition generally overwhelming the wet condition plays a more profound role in decreasing vegetation activity over most parts of mainland china however it also should be noted that some southern parts of mainland china throughout the growing season and the tibetan plateau mainly in may are places where vegetation decline is still more likely attributed to water surplus some southern parts more intensively influenced by wet conditions coincide with regions in the control of the monsoon rain belt and typhoons which brings a great deal of precipitation the thick cloud coverage accompanying the sufficient precipitation reduces solar radiation reaching the ground resulting in vegetation vigor decrease in the wet condition song and ma 2011 wang et al 2015b zhang et al 2010a with respect to the tibetan plateau the world s highest plateau with the average altitude of 4000 m its air temperature in may is much lower than that in the inland precipitation either in the solid or liquid state can further induce the lower soil temperature as a result of the reduction of solar radiation during the precipitation event as well as heat loss to colder precipitating water and cooling by evaporation su et al 2011 the decline in soil surface temperature subsequently inhibits vegetation recovery from the sparse status xu et al 2011b thus the wet condition has a higher probability of diminishing vegetation vigor than the dry condition across a large part of the tibetan plateau in may wet conditions with higher probability of inducing vegetation decrease in above regions can be more generally the results of the synthetic response of vegetation to precipitation solar radiation and air soil temperature and the complex interactions between these influential factors the analysis above reminds that the change in one influential factor such as precipitation in this study might induce noticeable variations in other factors which can subsequently pose more negative impacts on vegetation status 4 4 probabilities of vegetation decline to the lower percentiles conditioned on droughts with different severity as section 4 3 has confirmed the higher occurrence probabilities of vegetation decline conditioned on water deficits than that conditioned on water surplus over the most part 80 of mainland china this section shifts the specific focus to the quantification of drought impacts on vegetation health using the conditional probability distribution conditional probabilities of the deteriorating vegetation status are systematically calculated under three droughts scenarios including the moderate drought with 1 5 spei 1 the severe drought with 2 spei 1 5 and the extreme drought with spei 2 according to eqs 4 6 meantime in order to identify the drought vulnerable regions it is useful to comprehensively estimate probabilities of a specific drought resulting in the deteriorating vegetation status at diverse degrees which are set to be ndvi at 50th 40th 30th 20th and 10th percentiles in this study the ndvi at low percentile symbolizes the noticeable reduction in vegetation vigor and severe damage to terrestrial ecosystems places where conditional probabilities of vegetation decreasing below five percentile levels can consistently surpass those in other pixels under the same drought condition are recognized as drought prone regions figs 8 10 depict conditional probabilities of the deteriorating vegetation status under three drought scenarios for may june and september of the growing season respectively it is observed in fig 8 that the likelihood of ndvi falling below the 50th percentile increases markedly as the moderate drought develops into a severe or even extreme one the positive response of the vegetation status probability to the intensifying drought severity is further confirmed when worse vegetation status such as the ndvi lower than 40th 30th 20th and 10th percentiles are separately examined in may a similar pattern is also noted in figs 9 and 10 for june and september suggesting that when vegetation activity at a specific lower percentile is under investigation more severe water deficits are able to trigger higher probabilities of vegetation decline in the growing season in addition at a large spatial scale of mainland china the average probabilities of ndvi smaller than the 50th percentile under moderate severe and extreme drought scenarios are 60 1 63 2 and 66 2 in may respectively see fig 8 however the difference in the average likelihood of vegetation status under three drought scenarios grows to 7 7 9 3 and 10 6 when the deteriorating vegetation conditions are set to be the ndvi decreasing below the 40th 30th and 20th percentiles when more inferior vegetation status namely the ndvi less than the 10th percentile is considered the average probabilities in the domain of mainland china diverge into14 8 19 4 and 25 9 under the three drought scenarios respectively at this point the average probability of vegetation decline to the 10th percentile in the extreme drought condition becomes nearly two times as high as that in the moderate drought condition the same pattern is also observed for june and september on average during the whole growing season the difference in vegetation condition probabilities under extreme and moderate drought scenarios ascends from 6 9 8 8 10 8 12 7 to 13 7 when vegetation status at the 50th 40th 30th 20th and 10th percentiles are under investigation in sequence therefore the probabilistic analysis quantitatively evidences that major vegetation decline is more likely to occur in the case of increasingly severe drought conditions decision makers at the state level are always concerned about regions vulnerable to water deficits an important application of the current drought impact analysis is to distinguish drought vulnerable areas across mainland china from a probabilistic perspective which may benefit the effective drought preparedness and mitigation to this end probabilities of the multi level deteriorating vegetation status namely the ndvi smaller than 50th 40th 30th 20th and 10th percentiles conditional on the same drought scenario are compared among all pixels it is seen the relatively higher vegetation decline probabilities given the moderate drought in north china especially the central inner mongolia and southwest china fig 8 a these drought prone regions are in good agreement with those identified in the severe and extreme drought conditions fig 8 b and c for may as shown in fig 9 vegetation decline to the lower percentiles is more likely to happen under the three drought scenarios in north china and yunnan kweichow plateau in southwest china for june likewise the highest probabilities of the deteriorating vegetation status are observed in central inner mongolia in fig 10 a large part of northern china has noticeably higher probabilities of suffering from vegetation decline relative to the southern proportion in september north china and northwest china are recognized as drought sensitive regions for september with central inner mongolia showing the highest sensitivity to water shortage in general once a drought quantified by spei 1 which is at the 16th percentile of the long term precipitation record occurs in the growing season vegetation activity in north china can decrease below the equivalent percentile with the average probability of 0 368 which represents a relative increase of 28 1 as compared with the mean possibility 0 287 for mainland china when it comes to central inner mongolia 0 485 a more marked increase of as high as 68 8 is further noted in vegetation status probability relative to the mainland average therefore north china especially the grassland in central inner mongolia is the region where vegetation consistently has the lowest resistance to drought during the growing season in previous studies with particular focus on vegetation response assessment across inner mongolia of china miao et al 2018 li et al 2018 the highest sensitivity to water deficits was consistently observed in the steppe of its central part which is in line with drought prone areas recognized in the current study interestingly drought prone regions identified for may june and september are observed to maintain the high spei ndvi correlations in fig 3 confirming the potential of the spei ndvi correlation coefficient as a useful indicator for distinguishing where vegetation status is more vulnerable to water deficits for the growing season considering the complex structure of the proposed bivariate probabilistic model fig 2 based on which conditional probabilities are derived and drought vulnerable regions are identified it is essential to verify the model reliability by comparing the estimated conditional distributions of ndvi with the paired ndvi spei observations during the analysis period 1982 2014 ndvi distribution conditioned on different spei values are derived from the eq 7 as there are 4189 pixels across mainland china only five pixels are randomly selected from northwest china northeast china central china southwest china and southeast china for model validation results are presented in figs 11 13 in which each panel denotes a pixel in each panel the colored proportion indicates the pdf of ndvi conditioned on any given spei value each pdf at a given spei has been normalized with 100 representing the highest probability density and 0 representing the lowest density as indicated in figs 11 13 the majority of paired ndvi spei observations denoted by black dots fall within high density areas of pdfs thereby the bivariate probabilistic model developed is considered reliable for the use in this study 5 conclusions vegetation plays crucial roles in the global water cycle carbon dioxide budget and energy balance affecting many aspects of the earth system the groundwater storage atmospheric carbon concentration and air temperature therefore it is essential to investigate diverse determinants of vegetation health with particular attention paid by this study to drought impacts on terrestrial vegetation over mainland china previous efforts dealt with this topic mainly in a deterministic way herein a bivariate probabilistic model which combines the correlation analysis and copula theory is proposed for quantifying the influence of drought upon vegetation status and identifying drought vulnerable regions from a probabilistic perspective in the model correlations between vegetation vigor represented with the ndvi and water variability represented with the spei are firstly calculated at varying timescales a timescale at which the maximum spei ndvi correlation is recorded is considered as the response time of vegetation to water availability then the dependence structure of spei and ndvi is modeled based on the response time derived and copula functions furthermore conditional probabilities of vegetation decline to lower percentiles under three drought scenarios are systematically estimated depending on which drought sensitive regions are identified for the growing season results show contrasting spatial patterns of vegetation response time to water variability when seasonality is considered in the non growing season vegetation in the northern part of mainland china tends to respond to water stress at longer timescales compared with that in the southern proportion it may be because vegetation in the northern part has developed physiological mechanisms deeper roots and relatively smaller leaves for instance to cope with the frequent water shortage while biomes in the humid southern part have low water use efficiency and cannot withstand long term water variability in comparison the growing season presents a rapid response of vegetation to water variation in the northern part and delayed response in the south the phenomenon arises from a remarkable increase in water requirement for vegetation growth and reproduction and much less moisture supply in the northern part than the southern counterpart meanwhile water deficits are found in the growing season to have a higher likelihood of causing the below average vegetation status than water surplus across 80 9 of the territory in some regions water surplus unexpectedly plays a more profound role in diminishing vegetation vigor which is the result of the decrease in solar radiation or soil temperature that is induced by sufficient precipitation and can exert a more adverse effect on vegetation growth moreover when the deteriorating vegetation status at diverse levels i e the ndvi values below the 50th 40th 30th 20th and 10th percentiles are under investigation probabilities of vegetation decreasing below the corresponding percentiles under the moderate drought condition differ from those under the extreme drought scenario by 6 9 8 8 10 8 12 7 and 13 7 on average during the whole growing season respectively it is thereby highlighted that the exacerbated drought conditions can necessarily suggest higher likelihoods of inducing vegetation losses especially more intense vegetation decline with respect to the drought vulnerable region north china is consistently identified throughout the growing season where the occurrence probability of the deteriorating vegetation status 0 368 presents a 28 1 increase relative to the mainland average 0 287 particularly peak values of 0 485 of vegetation status possibility is noted in the central inner mongolia of north china denoting the highest sensitivity of vegetation health to drought stress findings above may have important implications for our increased understanding of the vegetation vulnerability to climatic extremes and the initiation of appropriate actions to mitigate vegetation stress besides the use for drought impact analysis the proposed model also enables the risk assessment of ecosystems and the ndvi forecasting based on the high quality precipitation and temperature forecasts available in addition the independent variable herein is the spei of the models can be flexibly replaced by other influential factors of interest such as the solar radiation to investigate their respective influence on vegetation status as revealed in the study vegetation status is the synthetic response to an ensemble of climatic and anthropogenic factors the current model has the potential to be extended to a high dimensional probabilistic model based on the same framework the high dimensional model able to include multiple determinant factors of concern will provide an alternative for analyzing the complicated interactions between different factors and ranking their influence which enables to detect main drivers of vegetation variations under a changing climate declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

6249,frequent droughts in a warming climate may exert more negative influences on ecosystems unlike previous studies that have investigated the vegetation response to drought generally in a deterministic way a copula based model is developed for quantifying drought impacts on terrestrial vegetation and identifying drought vulnerable regions for mainland china from a probabilistic perspective in this study the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is firstly correlated with the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei at varying timescales from 1 month to 24 months to determine the response time of vegetation to water variability then the dependence structure of vegetation vigor and water availability is modeled through the bivariate copula analysis furthermore conditional probabilities of vegetation decline under moderate severe and extreme drought scenarios are systematically estimated using copula based conditional probability distributions results indicate that spatial patterns of vegetation response time present distinct seasonality with faster response to water variation in the southern part than in the northern proportion of mainland china during the non growing season while the inverse pattern is observed for the growing season the higher conditional probabilities of the below average vegetation status in the dry condition evidence that water deficits overwhelming water surplus play a more profound role in diminishing vegetation vigor across more than 80 of mainland china specifically when moderate droughts develop into extreme ones the average probability of vegetation status below the 50th percentile escalates by 6 9 moreover extreme droughts are noted to exaggerate probabilities of vegetation activity falling below the increasingly lower 40th 30th 20th and 10th percentiles by 8 8 10 8 12 7 and 13 7 in comparison with moderate counterparts thereby suggesting higher likelihood of the deteriorating drought conditions inducing vegetation losses especially major vegetation decline as for the drought vulnerable region north china particularly the central inner mongolia is recognized with vegetation decline probabilities being 28 1 and 68 8 greater than the mainland average given drought conditions quantified as spei 1 respectively results of the study may improve our understanding of climatic extreme influence on vegetation status and benefit the effective drought preparedness and mitigation keywords vegetation vigor water balance copula analysis conditional probability drought vulnerable region 1 introduction the frequency of droughts is intensifying worldwide in the current context of a warming climate and is projected to increase in forthcoming decades by climate models dai 2011 schwalm et al 2017 sheffield and wood 2008 touma et al 2015 frequent and intense droughts tend to induce the vegetation decline crop yield reduction land degradation forest fire hot extremes and dampened hydropower generation delbiso et al 2017 fang et al 2017 hao et al 2017 li et al 2019 madadgar et al 2017 turco et al 2017 wilhite et al 2007 amongst diverse natural and human systems sensitive to water deficits terrestrial ecosystems have pronounced and complicated interactions with drought conditions as water is involved in all major physiological processes of vegetation seed germination photosynthesis respiration transpiration mineral absorption growth etc persistent water deficits over a sustained period can adversely impact vegetation functioning resulting in the slow growth mohammat et al 2013 reduced greenness xu et al 2011a biomass decline huang and anderegg 2012 and even vegetation die off zeppel et al 2013 determined by the resistance and resilience of diverse vegetation species to drought in turn the reduced vegetation vigor under drought stress leads to weaker photosynthetic activity and less carbon sequestration from the atmosphere what s worse when droughts induce massive biomass decline and vegetation mortality vegetation carbon can be subsequently decomposed by microbes into inorganic carbon and reenter the atmosphere which may have unpredictable consequences for the global carbon cycle since terrestrial vegetation is a main carbon pool on the earth the reduction in carbon uptake coupled with the gain of atmospheric carbon from faded organic matter implies that aboveground vegetation subject to severe drought stress could be turned into a significant carbon source contributing to more positive climate carbon cycle feedbacks that are expected to further aggravate drought conditions ciais et al 2005 friedlingstein et al 2006 therefore quantifying the negative impacts of drought on vegetation and identifying drought vulnerable areas are crucial for improving our understanding of the vegetation vulnerability to climate change and initiating effective mitigation actions evaluating drought impacts on terrestrial vegetation is primarily challenged by difficulties in drought quantification and the synthetic response of vegetation activity to an ensemble of climatic and anthropogenic factors droughts are difficult to quantify in time and space for the following reasons 1 a drought usually identified by its effects on diverse systems agriculture ecosystem and human society is not universally defined 2 the slow development of drought makes it hard to determine its onset and end 3 its impacts spread over a very large geographic area huang et al 2019 wilhite 2000 as for influential factors of vegetation activity water availability is known as one of the dominant constraints for the growth additionally vegetation variability can arise from changes in air temperature solar radiation floods pest infestation wildfire irrigation grazing fertilizer application and crop rotation ashourloo et al 2014 coop et al 2016 džubáková et al 2015 ji and peters 2003 ren et al 2019 wang et al 2015a weng et al 2004 previous studies concerning drought quantification mainly depended on various drought indices physically based models and water balance simulations a drought index assimilates a large amount of water supply information in a statistical framework and quantifies the deviation of accumulated moisture conditions from the long term average an attractive advantage of the use of drought indices over the other two alternatives is its convenience of deriving drought duration intensity and influential extent thus allowing diverse users to communicate drought information more efficiently by far different drought indices have been developed for natural and human systems of concern commonly used indices for drought monitoring comprise the palmer drought severity index pdsi liu et al 2017b palmer 1965 the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 the standardized soil moisture index ssi narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 the standardized runoff index sri huang et al 2017 shukla and wood 2008 and the multivariate standardized drought index msdi brown et al 2008 guo et al 2019 hao and aghakouchak 2014 meantime the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi obtained using satellite remote sensing and tree ring width series acquired from the ground observation are two important data sources available for characterizing the terrestrial vegetation changes and interpreting effects of climatic extremes on the biosphere liu et al 2018 benefiting from the use of drought and vegetation indices as proxies for drought and vegetation conditions previous efforts to assess drought impacts on vegetation activity have usually been simplified into examining correlations between drought indices and ndvi or tree ring series bento et al 2018 gouveia et al 2017 jain et al 2010 wu et al 2015 the strong association between drought indices and vegetation vigor indicators mainly the ndvi and tree ring series indicates significant drought impacts and vice versa the assessment of drought effects on terrestrial vegetation has been conducted across many parts of the globe for example ji and peters 2003 reported in the northern u s great plains the pronounced correlation between the ndvi and precipitation anomaly since approximately 67 and 58 of the crop and grass ndvi changes can be explained by the spi variations and seasonality using a linear regression model it is also found by a group of studies that the relationship between moisture availability and vegetation activity varies spatially and temporally in semiarid and arid areas vegetation status is more correlated with the moisture availability than in humid areas it means the higher sensitivity of biomes to drought stress in the former areas gouveia et al 2017 pasho et al 2011 vicente serrano 2007 humid areas are usually characterized by the positive water balance precipitation minus reference evapotranspiration where biomes are therefore less determined by drought as compared with those in arid ones vicente serrano et al 2013 temporally the growing season is the center of attention the highest ndvi correlations with precipitation anomaly are noted in the middle of the growing season as compared with lower associations occurring at the beginning and end of the growing season ji and peters 2003 drought impacts varying as a function of the month of a year are partially attributed to remarkable changes in water requirement at different stages of plant growth and maturity salter 1967 further defined a moisture sensitive period which corresponds to the time of developing reproductive organs water shortage during the moisture sensitive period is considered to most adversely influence the plant size and yield it is therefore increasingly highlighted by recent studies the necessity of taking into consideration the seasonal timing when quantifying drought impacts on vegetation activity fang et al 2019a gouveia et al 2017 mina et al 2016 souza 2016 in addition to the correlation amplitude the drought timescale at which the highest correlation is recorded has also been receiving much attention the drought timescale or the response time refers to the time delay existing between the starting of a water deficit and the recognition of its consequences emphasizing that drought impacts do not occur instantaneously but are results of moisture deficits accumulated over a period of time humid and arid vegetation is observed to respond to drought at short timescales i e the rapid response vicente serrano 2013 zhang et al 2010c in comparison there exists longer response time i e the lagged response in sub humid and semiarid areas where vegetation regularly subject to short periods of water deficits has evolved physiological mechanisms to tolerate adverse conditions pasho et al 2011 in fact the response time measures both of how fast vegetation is adversely affected by the drought episode and how fast it recovers from the drought disturbance thereby being able to to some extent quantify the resistance and resilience of vegetation to drought van hoek et al 2016 vicente serrano et al 2013 previous studies on the drought impact assessment were accustomed to the use of the spi for drought characterization due to its low data requirements and computational simplicity the spi is calculated merely using precipitation data while neglecting the influence of other meteo climatic variables on drought development beguería et al 2014 stagge et al 2015 the use of spi is justified under the assumption that other variables are relatively stationary and precipitation anomalies are significantly higher than those of other variables vicente serrano et al 2010 however the global warming reminds a general increase in air temperature worldwide which can exacerbate drought conditions by increasing the atmospheric evaporative demand shukla et al 2015 vicente serrano et al 2014 williams et al 2013 vegetation activity is also known to be more sensitive to water balance precipitation minus reference evapotranspiration rather than water supply alone beer et al 2007 piedallu et al 2013 it is therefore more reasonable to include the role of temperature in drought monitoring especially under a warming climate in order to present a reliable drought vegetation activity relationship besides previous efforts were limited to dealing with drought impacts in a deterministic way and results are provided with the specific focus on how closely the vegetation variability is associated with drought conditions and how fast vegetation responds to water deficits in areas of interest in contrast ecologists decision makers and crop producers also prefer an elaborated model that produces probability distributions of vegetation losses conditioned on drought events which are projected to happen in the upcoming growing season to this end this study is intended to advance a further step to present a bivariate probabilistic model for quantifying drought impacts on terrestrial vegetation dynamics mainly dependent on 1 identifying the response time of vegetation activity represented by the ndvi to variability in water balance represented by the spei by means of the correlation analysis 2 describing the dependence structure between water balance and vegetation vigor through the bivariate copula analysis 3 estimating the occurrence probabilities of the below normal vegetation status under three namely moderate severe and extreme drought scenarios using copula based conditional probability distributions a case study is conducted over mainland china results may improve our understanding of climatic determinants of terrestrial vegetation and assist decision makers in the recognition of drought vulnerable areas from a probabilistic perspective which have important implications for taking appropriate actions to mitigate vegetation stress 2 study area and data mainland china as shown by statistics has frequently suffered from droughts during the second half of the twentieth century largely as a result of the variability in the asian monsoons and westerly circulations as well as the complicated landform qian et al 2011 xu et al 2015 particularly severe droughts in north china plain in 1968 1972 1983 1997 and 2015 yellow river basin in 1965 1972 1980 and 1997 and southwest china in 2006 and 2009 induced large agricultural economic and societal losses therefore it is the practical need to assess drought impacts on natural and human systems over mainland china with specific attention given to terrestrial vegetation in this study mainland china 72 e 36 e 18 n 54 n fig 1 is located in the east asian monsoon climate zone where precipitation and air temperature present distinct monthly annual

model including the spei ndvi and copula theory are outlined in the method section 3 1 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei the spei is used by the study for drought identification and characterization the widely used spi accounting for the abnormal water deficits based only on precipitation anomalies emphasizes the precipitation as the dominant forcing for drought variability however the profound role of air temperature in drought development has been observed among well known droughts occurring in europe vicente serrano et al 2014 east asia xu et al 2015 and western united states diffenbaugh et al 2015 and is projected by general circulation models to grow under a global warming scenario williams et al 2013 the physical mechanism of higher temperature exacerbating the water stress is that the consequent increase in evaporation demand caused by higher temperature can drive the water balance i e the difference between precipitation and reference evapotranspiration increasingly towards the lower value even though the precipitation received remains invariant aware of the potential deficiency of applying the spi under global warming conditions vicente serrano et al 2010 improved the index formulation by additionally including the temperature which is represented by reference evapotranspiration and developed a novel drought index spei the spei is based on the concept of water supply and demand measuring the deviation of water balance from the long term mean water balance d in the spei is defined as 1 d p e t 0 in which p and e t 0 represent the monthly precipitation and reference evapotranspiration vicente serrano and beguería 2010 2014 recommended the use of the thornthwaite equation thornthwaite 1948 for the e t 0 calculation because the equation merely requires the mean monthly temperature and latitude as inputs which can be available at the global scale fang et al 2018 the rest procedure for the spei calculation is much the same as that of spi the obtained water balance is then aggregated at timescales of particular interest usually 1 3 6 12 and 24 months a three parameter log logistic distribution is fitted to the aggregated water balance for each calendar month individually finally an equiprobability transformation is performed to convert the log logistic distribution to the standard normal distribution this yields a standardized spei series with the mean of zero and a standard deviation of one which is comparable over time and space according to different thresholds dry and wet conditions are categorized by the spei as follows extremely wetness spei 2 severe wetness 1 5 spei 2 moderate wetness 1 spei 1 5 nearly normal condition 1 spei 1 moderate drought 1 5 spei 1 severe drought 2 spei 1 5 and extreme drought spei 2 the spei advantageously integrates the multi scalar characteristic similar to the spi with the sensitivity to evaporation variations resulting from the temperature fluctuation similar to the pdsi the multi scalar property of drought indices is essential to assess the response time of vegetation activity to drought conditions in this study the spei is calculated at multiple timescales ranging from 1 month to 24 months as illustrated in fig 2 the response time is defined as the timescale at which the maximum spei ndvi correlation is acquired gouveia et al 2017 pasho et al 2011 vicente serrano et al 2013 3 2 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi the ndvi the remote sensing data derived from the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr is commonly utilized as a reliable indicator of the presence growth and decline of terrestrial vegetation it exhibits high correlations with the leaf area index hasegawa et al 2010 wang et al 2005 total vegetation biomass le maire et al 2011 raynolds et al 2012 and fractional vegetation cover carlson and ripley 1997 jacquin et al 2010 the capability of the ndvi to quantify vegetation dynamics is closely related to the absorptive and reflective characteristics of vegetation in the near infrared and red bands of the electromagnetic spectrum tadesse et al 2005 healthy vegetation absorbs an important percentage of visible light for the use of photosynthesis thereby reflecting less solar radiation in the red band relative to that in the near infrared band jain et al 2010 in contrast the avhrr onboard the noaa satellites will receive increased radiation in the red band and decreased near infrared radiation from places where vegetation is under stress the ndvi is defined as 2 ndvi ρ nir ρ red ρ nir ρ red where ρ red and ρ nir denote the reflected radiation in the red and near infrared bands respectively the use of avhrr ndvi presents several advantages over the ground based observations including that i the ndvi has the high spatial resolution of 1 12 ii the avhrr instrument provides twice daily global coverage iii the biweekly ndvi database routinely updated by the noaa can be freely available 3 3 copula based method for estimating conditional probabilities of vegetation decline in different drought conditions the proposed bivariate probabilistic model is utilized to describe the complicated dependence structure between drought conditions represented by the spei and the vegetation activity represented by the ndvi the results are presented in the form of the joint distribution of the spei and the ndvi afterward the joint distribution is utilized to calculate conditional probabilities of vegetation decline to lower percentiles in multiple drought conditions e g the moderate severe and extreme droughts given the forecast of a water deficit in the near future one can thus derive the corresponding vegetation status distribution and estimate the probability of vegetation activity lower than a specific percentile in advance 3 3 1 joint probability distribution copula functions are employed to model the dependence of vegetation vigor on drought conditions assume x and y to be the spei and ndvi series their joint distribution f xy x y based on the copula function c with its independent variables being uniformly distributed on the interval 0 1 is formulated as follows 3 p x x y y f xy x y c f x x f y y where f x x and f y y are cumulative distribution functions cdfs of random variables x and y respectively note that f xy x y joins the original random variables namely x and y while the copula function c uses cdfs of x and y as independent variables madadgar et al 2017 some well defined bivariate distribution models e g the normal gamma beta and exponential types request that all random variables come from the same distributions nadarajah and kotz 2006 oh and suh 2017 olkin and trikalinos 2015 yue et al 2001 in comparison copula functions can flexibly connect two or more random variables having different kinds of marginals which has subsequently inspired the increasing applications of copulas in meteorological and hydrological studies bokusheva et al 2016 huang et al 2014b kwon and lall 2016 park et al 2017 more specifically the use of copula functions simplifies the formulation of joint distributions into the modeling of marginals and dependence structure fig 2 in this study four types of candidate distributions i e normal gamma logistic and log norm distributions are fitted to the monthly ndvi series as no consensus can be easily achieved on the most appropriate marginal from previous studies de beurs and henebry 2004 song 2005 wen et al 2012 the optimal marginal distributions are screened out based on the kolmogorov smirnov k s test and the akaike information criterion yu et al 2018a as stated in section 3 1 the spei is a normalized variable with the mean of zero and the standard deviation of one thereby the normal distribution is used as the marginal distribution of the spei series in regard to modeling the dependence structure between the ndvi and spei archimedean and elliptical copulas are considered which are two major copula families quite popular in the previous studies grimaldi et al 2016 yu et al 2018b zhou et al 2017 amongst six candidates listed in table 1 gaussian and student s t copulas come from the elliptical family and joe frank gumbel and clayton copulas are from the archimedean family zhao et al 2019 parameters of candidate copulas are estimated using the maximum likelihood method mle moreover a goodness of fit test based on the rosenblatt s transform genest et al 2009 is employed to select the best copula for the precise description of the ndvi dependence on the spei the one with the minimum cramér von mises statistic and the maximum p value is regarded as the most appropriate copula fang et al 2019b however it is worth noting that some previous studies have observed the negative spei ndvi correlations jain et al 2010 ji and peters 2003 vicente serrano 2007 wang et al 2015b while joe gumbel and clayton copulas are confined to accounting for the positive dependence in such cases the optimal one is screened out from gaussian student s t and frank copulas which are valid for dealing with both of the negative and positive spei ndvi dependence herein is presented an outline of how to use cupula functions to describe the dependence between two random variables for more details interested readers are referred to nelsen 2007 and genest and favre 2007 3 3 2 conditional distribution ecologists decision makers and crop producers often concern themselves with the likelihood of vegetation decline to the lower percentiles when drought events occur which is expressed as the conditional probability i e p y y x x from a statistical perspective the conditional probability can be estimated using the joint distribution formulated above and the drought classification by the spei in section 3 1 in this study droughts with diverse severity are considered including the moderate drought 1 5 spei 1 the severe drought 2 spei 1 5 and the extreme drought spei 2 thus conditional probabilities of the ndvi lower than a certain percentile y given three drought conditions are derived as follows 4 when moderate droughts occur p y y 1 5 x 1 p 1 5 x 1 y y p 1 5 x 1 f xy 1 y f xy 1 5 y f x 1 f x 1 5 5 when severe droughts occur p y y 2 x 1 5 p 2 x 1 5 y y p 2 x 1 5 f xy 1 5 y f xy 2 y f x 1 5 f x 2 6 when extreme droughts occur p y y x 2 p x 2 y y p x 2 f xy 2 y f x 2 where x and y denote the spei and ndvi respectively eqs 4 6 generally quantify the ndvi response to spei varying in a wide range in addition the occurrence probability of the deteriorating vegetation status given a specific value of the drought index i e p y y x x is also of interest according to the copula theory the conditional probability density function pdf of p y y x x is formulated as follows 7 f y x y x c f x x f y y f y y in which c u v c u v u v is defined as the first order derivative of the copula function c u v and f y y denotes the pdf of the ndvi once the pdf f y x y x conditional on a specific drought condition x x is derived using the equation 7 the conditional probability of the ndvi lower than a certain percentile p y y x x can be computed as the area under f y x y x for y y estimating probabilities of the deteriorating ndvi values conditional both on a wide spei range and on a particular spei value meantime benefits the assessment of drought impacts and the identification of drought vulnerable regions from a probabilistic perspective 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial pattern of spei ndvi correlations the ndvi is correlated with the spei at varying timescales from 1 month to 24 months to identify the response time of vegetation vigor to water variability given that vegetation usually responds to water variation accumulated over a period of time but not instantaneously the response time investigated here can be defined as the characteristic timescale at which the maximum spei ndvi correlation is acquired fig 3 shows the maximum pearson correlation coefficients in each pixel for twelve months for ease of analysis the whole year is divided into the growing season april october and the non growing season november december and january march when the spei ndvi relationship can show distinct spatial patterns in the non growing season spei ndvi correlations are observed to present less spatial variation across mainland china relative to those in the growing season terrestrial biomes in most parts of mainland china are positively correlated with water availability during the non growing season it is because mainland china in the non growing season is dominantly influenced by the east asian winter monsoon which brings much less moisture and water availability becomes a crucial factor in restraining vegetation vigor it is also noted that the much weaker or even negative spei ndvi correlations occur in some regions with higher latitudes including a large part of northeast china and the northwestern edge of the territory and lower latitudes including the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river mlyr and south china in the late autumn and early winter i e november and december the rapid and remarkable temperature drop which largely decreases the enzyme activity indispensable for various physiological processes of vegetation such as the photosynthesis and respiration is a primary driver responsible for the biomass decline in northeast china at relatively higher latitudes thus weakening the influence of water availability on vegetation status as for the mlyr and south china the reduction in vegetation greenness in november and december is more attributed to the crop harvest mainly the late rice instead of the water variability also resulting in the weaker spei ndvi association zhang et al 2010b 2014 when it comes to february and march vegetation in northeast china and the northwestern edge of the territory can start to recover as a direct consequence of the temperature rise and soil moisture gain from the snow and glacier melt even though only a little precipitation occurs therefore less dependence of the spring vegetation recovery on the precipitation is presented where there is additional soil moisture supply from the snowpack and glaciers likewise in a study conducted by gouveia et al 2017 for the mediterranean region the evidently weak spring ndvi spei correlations were noted in alpine and carpathian mountains where there was sufficient snow accumulation available for replenishing the soil moisture and highlighted that temperature rather than precipitation was a more significant determinant of vegetation status in spring in comparison the spei ndvi correlation in the growing season indicates the evident spatial heterogeneity which is characterized by much stronger correlations in the northern part of mainland china relative to those in the southern proportion the spatial difference is noticeable almost throughout the growing season may october while less observable at the beginning of the growing season april the border between areas with strong and weak spei ndvi correlations is observed especially from june to september to be in good agreement with the huai river and qinling mountain range routinely used to distinguish northern china and southern china according to different climate characteristics the northern part as shown in fig 1 b mainly comprises the sub humid 400 mm annual precipitation 800 mm semiarid 200 mm annual precipitation 400 mm and arid annual precipitation 200 mm regions of mainland china a close look at the northern part of china from fig 3 finds that north china and the loess plateau classified as sub humid and semiarid regions have higher correlation coefficients than the eastern and northern edges of northeast china the humid region and the middle and western proportions of northwest china the arid region in addition some negative spei ndvi correlations are noted in northeast china during august september and october which are ascribed to the crop harvest mainly the spring wheat and rice inducing decreased greenness even though increased precipitation is brought by the eastern asian summer monsoon with respect to the southern part of mainland china it is classified as the humid region annual precipitation 800 mm for the humid region a negative spei in the growing season when most of the total annual precipitation occurs does not necessarily suggest a water deficit because water balance may still keep positive fig 5 thus water variability in the growing season is not a crucial constraint on vegetation growth resulting in the weakened spei ndvi relationship in the southern part of mainland china compared with that in the northern part meantime it is interesting to notice that the spatial evolution of the negative spei ndvi association in the southern proportion follows the pathway of the monsoon rain belt the monsoon rain belt prevails in the growing season over mainland china arriving in south china in april moving northward to the mlyr and the huai river basin in late june proceeding towards north china and northeast china in early august and retreating southward to south china in october regions under the influence of the rain belt obviously get abundant rainfall while receiving less solar radiation due to cloud blockage a shortage of solar radiation can lead to a decrease in photosynthetic activity and adversely impact vegetation growth therefore it is deduced that during the growing season vegetation variations in regions which are in the control of the rain belt is primarily driven by solar radiation shortage and less dependent on water variability spatial pattern analysis of the spei ndvi relationship above reveals in the non growing season the unnoticeable spatial variation in positive dependence between vegetation status and water variability across mainland china in the growing season the obvious spatial heterogeneity is presented generally with the strong correlation in the northern part of mainland china and the weak linkage in the humid southern proportion results are in line with previous studies conducted at a global scale and in northern china by vicente serrano et al 2013 and xu et al 2018 who concluded that biomes in arid and semiarid regions are more responsive to water availability than those in sub humid and humid ones it is also found that vegetation status is the synthetic response to multiple factors including moisture condition air temperature solar radiation and anthropogenic intervention and changes in other related factors such as the crop harvest inducing the greenness decrease and the temperature decline and solar radiation shortage sufficient to hamper the physiological functioning may weaken the dependence of vegetation activity on water variability particularly during the growing season the weaker or even negative spei ndvi correlation in the southern part of mainland china evolves in space following the pathway of the monsoon rain belt which causes the reduction in solar radiation thus there can be moisture limited and solar radiation limited vegetation in northern and southern proportions during the growing season respectively 4 2 response time of vegetation activity to water variability fig 4 indicates the response time of vegetation activity to water deficits surplus which is defined as the spei timescale at which the maximum pearson correlation coefficient is recorded in the non growing season the response time varies markedly across mainland china vegetation generally tends to respond to water variation at longer timescales in the sub humid semiarid and arid regions of the northern territory than in the humid southern proportion of mainland china the difference in response time indicates that vegetation in diverse regions has different strategies to cope with water deficits in arid semiarid and sub humid regions vegetation is regularly subject to water shortage and has evolved physiological mechanisms including a more efficient water conservation system and deeper roots to adapt to adverse conditions related to water availability these physiological mechanisms can help to mitigate the negative influence of short term water shortage on vegetation activity thereby forming the vegetation response time at longer timescales in the aforementioned regions in contrast humid regions even though there is a negative spei are often characterized by positive water balance given the sufficient moisture supply vegetation in humid regions has relatively shallow root systems and lower water use efficiency as compared with that in the drier climates hence in the non growing season when much less precipitation occurs vegetation with low water use efficiency in humid regions is quite sensitive to water deficits cumulated over a short period of time the reasoning is supported by a finding by pasho et al 2011 in north eastern spain which highlighted the role of a more conservative water and deeper root system in mitigating the negative influence of short time water deficits on vegetation health it is also observed in fig 4 that in most of the northern part of mainland china especially in north china and the loess plateau the response time of vegetation to water variability starts to decline at the beginning of the growing season april and may whereas vegetation response time in the southern territory presents an ascending trend at the same time increasing and decreasing trends of vegetation response time in these two parts maintain till august resulting in a rapid response of vegetation in the northern part except for northeast china and delayed response of vegetation in the southern proportion respectively thus in strong contrast with the non growing season the middle of the growing season june august shows an inverse spatial pattern of vegetation response time across mainland china it is known that there is a remarkable change of water requirement at different stages of plant growth and maturity the faster response of vegetation to water stress in the northern part except for northeast china may be explained by the fact that when average water balance maintains negative during the growing season fig 5 an increasing amount of water required for the plant growth leaf enlargement reproduction and cooling can induce the enhanced sensitivity of vegetation activity to water deficits at shorter timescales in contrast with the northern part the southern proportion which acquires plenty of precipitation from the summer monsoon and typhoons has positive values of average water balance during the growing season see fig 5 positive water balance precipitation minus reference evapotranspiration cumulated over a period of time can contribute to an increase in soil moisture which alleviates the sensitivity of vegetation vigor to short term water deficits and make vegetation able to respond to water stress at longer timescales results coincide with a study by vicente serrano et al 2013 who observed the generally positive correlation of vegetation response time with water balance in the range of near zero which is just the case in mainland china the spatial pattern of response time revealed above shows that during the non growing season biomes in the northern part of mainland china respond to water variability at longer timescales relative to those in the southern part conversely the northern proportion except for northeast china has shorter response time than its southern counterpart in the growing season it should be noted that vegetation response time in this study is derived from the pearson correlation analysis which comprehensively quantifies linkages between vegetation reaction and water deficits surplus thus response time can be regarded as a useful indicator for assessing the vegetation resistance to drought and the resilience after the drought episode has terminated with its large value indicating a strong ability to withstand drought while a slow recovery rate from drought and vice versa 4 3 vegetation decline caused by water deficit and water surplus from a probabilistic perspective given the response time of vegetation to water variability identified above the joint distribution of vegetation status and water availability is modeled based on the monthly ndvi series and its most correlated spei series then the bivariate probabilistic analysis can be conducted in the following sections to quantify drought impacts on terrestrial vegetation using the copula based method described in section 3 3 pearson correlation analysis in section 4 1 provides evidence of the extent to which vegetation vigor is linked to both of water deficits and surplus however there is a lack of general knowledge about whether water deficits can surpass water surplus and plays a more profound role in diminishing vegetation vigor over mainland china thus this fundamental concern is dealt with in this section by comparing probabilities of ndvi less than the monthly average in dry and wet conditions for the month of interest prior to the specific investigation into impacts of different drought conditions such efforts are essential as they can reinforce the importance of the topic of this study in contrast to the non growing season the vigorous vegetation activity in the growing season largely determining the grain and biomass yields bolton and friedl 2013 lumbierres et al 2017 and diverse ecological benefits bonan 2008 becomes a high concern of crop producers ecologists and decision makers in relevant departments the growing season april october consists of large parts of spring and autumn and the entire summer however it is not easy to present results of drought impact assessment month by month for the ease of analysis three months showing the strongest spei ndvi associations in individual season are successively screened out from spring summer and autumn high values of the spei ndvi relation can necessarily imply that the ndvi changes keep pace with water variability in a close way it is also reasonable to deduce that the representative months having the ndvi in the closest relationship with the spei may be when ecosystems are most intensely affected by drought conditions in the corresponding seasons they are qualified to represent the most adverse situations that deserve adequate attention therefore analysis of drought impacts on vegetation is directed to months with the highest correlation coefficient in individual seasons in order to systematically compare the degree of the spi ndvi dependence among diverse months exceedance probabilities of different levels of the spei ndvi correlations are summarized from all pixels in the domain of mainland china and also scattered in fig 6 it is seen in fig 6 a that the spei ndvi correlations in may the red line have higher probabilities to exceed a given value as compared with those denoted by the blue line in april may thus represents the month with the stronger spei ndvi linkage in spring months of the growing season and are subsequently identified it is the same case for autumn months of the growing season fig 6 c giving rise to september the blue line being selected out in summer fig 6 b exceedance probability curves are twisted together which severs as the evidence of the very similar strength of the spei ndvi correlations in june july and august still june i e the blue line can present higher values of exceedance probability when correlation coefficients in a wide range are investigated june is therefore considered to have the slightly closer ndvi spei linkage among summer months in this way may june and september are identified as representative months for spring summer and autumn afterward conditional probabilities of ndvi smaller than the monthly average ndv i ave in the dry condition spei 0 5 and in the wet condition spei 0 5 are computed for may june and september respectively fig 7 indicates the difference in below average vegetation condition probabilities under dry and wet conditions expressed as p ndvi n d v i ave spei 0 5 p ndvi n d v i ave spei 0 5 in which a positive value implies that vegetation decline is more likely triggered by water deficits than by water surplus and vice versa counting up pixels with the positive probability difference explains that roughly 80 9 of mainland china in may has a higher likelihood of suffering from reduced vegetation activity in the dry condition than in the wet condition the territory where vegetation decline is more related to water deficits than water surplus climbs up to 88 4 and 85 1 in june and september therefore in the growing season the dry condition generally overwhelming the wet condition plays a more profound role in decreasing vegetation activity over most parts of mainland china however it also should be noted that some southern parts of mainland china throughout the growing season and the tibetan plateau mainly in may are places where vegetation decline is still more likely attributed to water surplus some southern parts more intensively influenced by wet conditions coincide with regions in the control of the monsoon rain belt and typhoons which brings a great deal of precipitation the thick cloud coverage accompanying the sufficient precipitation reduces solar radiation reaching the ground resulting in vegetation vigor decrease in the wet condition song and ma 2011 wang et al 2015b zhang et al 2010a with respect to the tibetan plateau the world s highest plateau with the average altitude of 4000 m its air temperature in may is much lower than that in the inland precipitation either in the solid or liquid state can further induce the lower soil temperature as a result of the reduction of solar radiation during the precipitation event as well as heat loss to colder precipitating water and cooling by evaporation su et al 2011 the decline in soil surface temperature subsequently inhibits vegetation recovery from the sparse status xu et al 2011b thus the wet condition has a higher probability of diminishing vegetation vigor than the dry condition across a large part of the tibetan plateau in may wet conditions with higher probability of inducing vegetation decrease in above regions can be more generally the results of the synthetic response of vegetation to precipitation solar radiation and air soil temperature and the complex interactions between these influential factors the analysis above reminds that the change in one influential factor such as precipitation in this study might induce noticeable variations in other factors which can subsequently pose more negative impacts on vegetation status 4 4 probabilities of vegetation decline to the lower percentiles conditioned on droughts with different severity as section 4 3 has confirmed the higher occurrence probabilities of vegetation decline conditioned on water deficits than that conditioned on water surplus over the most part 80 of mainland china this section shifts the specific focus to the quantification of drought impacts on vegetation health using the conditional probability distribution conditional probabilities of the deteriorating vegetation status are systematically calculated under three droughts scenarios including the moderate drought with 1 5 spei 1 the severe drought with 2 spei 1 5 and the extreme drought with spei 2 according to eqs 4 6 meantime in order to identify the drought vulnerable regions it is useful to comprehensively estimate probabilities of a specific drought resulting in the deteriorating vegetation status at diverse degrees which are set to be ndvi at 50th 40th 30th 20th and 10th percentiles in this study the ndvi at low percentile symbolizes the noticeable reduction in vegetation vigor and severe damage to terrestrial ecosystems places where conditional probabilities of vegetation decreasing below five percentile levels can consistently surpass those in other pixels under the same drought condition are recognized as drought prone regions figs 8 10 depict conditional probabilities of the deteriorating vegetation status under three drought scenarios for may june and september of the growing season respectively it is observed in fig 8 that the likelihood of ndvi falling below the 50th percentile increases markedly as the moderate drought develops into a severe or even extreme one the positive response of the vegetation status probability to the intensifying drought severity is further confirmed when worse vegetation status such as the ndvi lower than 40th 30th 20th and 10th percentiles are separately examined in may a similar pattern is also noted in figs 9 and 10 for june and september suggesting that when vegetation activity at a specific lower percentile is under investigation more severe water deficits are able to trigger higher probabilities of vegetation decline in the growing season in addition at a large spatial scale of mainland china the average probabilities of ndvi smaller than the 50th percentile under moderate severe and extreme drought scenarios are 60 1 63 2 and 66 2 in may respectively see fig 8 however the difference in the average likelihood of vegetation status under three drought scenarios grows to 7 7 9 3 and 10 6 when the deteriorating vegetation conditions are set to be the ndvi decreasing below the 40th 30th and 20th percentiles when more inferior vegetation status namely the ndvi less than the 10th percentile is considered the average probabilities in the domain of mainland china diverge into14 8 19 4 and 25 9 under the three drought scenarios respectively at this point the average probability of vegetation decline to the 10th percentile in the extreme drought condition becomes nearly two times as high as that in the moderate drought condition the same pattern is also observed for june and september on average during the whole growing season the difference in vegetation condition probabilities under extreme and moderate drought scenarios ascends from 6 9 8 8 10 8 12 7 to 13 7 when vegetation status at the 50th 40th 30th 20th and 10th percentiles are under investigation in sequence therefore the probabilistic analysis quantitatively evidences that major vegetation decline is more likely to occur in the case of increasingly severe drought conditions decision makers at the state level are always concerned about regions vulnerable to water deficits an important application of the current drought impact analysis is to distinguish drought vulnerable areas across mainland china from a probabilistic perspective which may benefit the effective drought preparedness and mitigation to this end probabilities of the multi level deteriorating vegetation status namely the ndvi smaller than 50th 40th 30th 20th and 10th percentiles conditional on the same drought scenario are compared among all pixels it is seen the relatively higher vegetation decline probabilities given the moderate drought in north china especially the central inner mongolia and southwest china fig 8 a these drought prone regions are in good agreement with those identified in the severe and extreme drought conditions fig 8 b and c for may as shown in fig 9 vegetation decline to the lower percentiles is more likely to happen under the three drought scenarios in north china and yunnan kweichow plateau in southwest china for june likewise the highest probabilities of the deteriorating vegetation status are observed in central inner mongolia in fig 10 a large part of northern china has noticeably higher probabilities of suffering from vegetation decline relative to the southern proportion in september north china and northwest china are recognized as drought sensitive regions for september with central inner mongolia showing the highest sensitivity to water shortage in general once a drought quantified by spei 1 which is at the 16th percentile of the long term precipitation record occurs in the growing season vegetation activity in north china can decrease below the equivalent percentile with the average probability of 0 368 which represents a relative increase of 28 1 as compared with the mean possibility 0 287 for mainland china when it comes to central inner mongolia 0 485 a more marked increase of as high as 68 8 is further noted in vegetation status probability relative to the mainland average therefore north china especially the grassland in central inner mongolia is the region where vegetation consistently has the lowest resistance to drought during the growing season in previous studies with particular focus on vegetation response assessment across inner mongolia of china miao et al 2018 li et al 2018 the highest sensitivity to water deficits was consistently observed in the steppe of its central part which is in line with drought prone areas recognized in the current study interestingly drought prone regions identified for may june and september are observed to maintain the high spei ndvi correlations in fig 3 confirming the potential of the spei ndvi correlation coefficient as a useful indicator for distinguishing where vegetation status is more vulnerable to water deficits for the growing season considering the complex structure of the proposed bivariate probabilistic model fig 2 based on which conditional probabilities are derived and drought vulnerable regions are identified it is essential to verify the model reliability by comparing the estimated conditional distributions of ndvi with the paired ndvi spei observations during the analysis period 1982 2014 ndvi distribution conditioned on different spei values are derived from the eq 7 as there are 4189 pixels across mainland china only five pixels are randomly selected from northwest china northeast china central china southwest china and southeast china for model validation results are presented in figs 11 13 in which each panel denotes a pixel in each panel the colored proportion indicates the pdf of ndvi conditioned on any given spei value each pdf at a given spei has been normalized with 100 representing the highest probability density and 0 representing the lowest density as indicated in figs 11 13 the majority of paired ndvi spei observations denoted by black dots fall within high density areas of pdfs thereby the bivariate probabilistic model developed is considered reliable for the use in this study 5 conclusions vegetation plays crucial roles in the global water cycle carbon dioxide budget and energy balance affecting many aspects of the earth system the groundwater storage atmospheric carbon concentration and air temperature therefore it is essential to investigate diverse determinants of vegetation health with particular attention paid by this study to drought impacts on terrestrial vegetation over mainland china previous efforts dealt with this topic mainly in a deterministic way herein a bivariate probabilistic model which combines the correlation analysis and copula theory is proposed for quantifying the influence of drought upon vegetation status and identifying drought vulnerable regions from a probabilistic perspective in the model correlations between vegetation vigor represented with the ndvi and water variability represented with the spei are firstly calculated at varying timescales a timescale at which the maximum spei ndvi correlation is recorded is considered as the response time of vegetation to water availability then the dependence structure of spei and ndvi is modeled based on the response time derived and copula functions furthermore conditional probabilities of vegetation decline to lower percentiles under three drought scenarios are systematically estimated depending on which drought sensitive regions are identified for the growing season results show contrasting spatial patterns of vegetation response time to water variability when seasonality is considered in the non growing season vegetation in the northern part of mainland china tends to respond to water stress at longer timescales compared with that in the southern proportion it may be because vegetation in the northern part has developed physiological mechanisms deeper roots and relatively smaller leaves for instance to cope with the frequent water shortage while biomes in the humid southern part have low water use efficiency and cannot withstand long term water variability in comparison the growing season presents a rapid response of vegetation to water variation in the northern part and delayed response in the south the phenomenon arises from a remarkable increase in water requirement for vegetation growth and reproduction and much less moisture supply in the northern part than the southern counterpart meanwhile water deficits are found in the growing season to have a higher likelihood of causing the below average vegetation status than water surplus across 80 9 of the territory in some regions water surplus unexpectedly plays a more profound role in diminishing vegetation vigor which is the result of the decrease in solar radiation or soil temperature that is induced by sufficient precipitation and can exert a more adverse effect on vegetation growth moreover when the deteriorating vegetation status at diverse levels i e the ndvi values below the 50th 40th 30th 20th and 10th percentiles are under investigation probabilities of vegetation decreasing below the corresponding percentiles under the moderate drought condition differ from those under the extreme drought scenario by 6 9 8 8 10 8 12 7 and 13 7 on average during the whole growing season respectively it is thereby highlighted that the exacerbated drought conditions can necessarily suggest higher likelihoods of inducing vegetation losses especially more intense vegetation decline with respect to the drought vulnerable region north china is consistently identified throughout the growing season where the occurrence probability of the deteriorating vegetation status 0 368 presents a 28 1 increase relative to the mainland average 0 287 particularly peak values of 0 485 of vegetation status possibility is noted in the central inner mongolia of north china denoting the highest sensitivity of vegetation health to drought stress findings above may have important implications for our increased understanding of the vegetation vulnerability to climatic extremes and the initiation of appropriate actions to mitigate vegetation stress besides the use for drought impact analysis the proposed model also enables the risk assessment of ecosystems and the ndvi forecasting based on the high quality precipitation and temperature forecasts available in addition the independent variable herein is the spei of the models can be flexibly replaced by other influential factors of interest such as the solar radiation to investigate their respective influence on vegetation status as revealed in the study vegetation status is the synthetic response to an ensemble of climatic and anthropogenic factors the current model has the potential to be extended to a high dimensional probabilistic model based on the same framework the high dimensional model able to include multiple determinant factors of concern will provide an alternative for analyzing the complicated interactions between different factors and ranking their influence which enables to detect main drivers of vegetation variations under a changing climate declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
