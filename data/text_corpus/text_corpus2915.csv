14575,fouling problems due to limescale formation are of major concern to many industries deterioration of heat transfer equipment performance and substantial increase of pressure drop across piping systems comprise the main problems resulting in high machinery maintenance cost and decreased productivity limescale removal techniques like scraping hydro blasting and the use of aggressive chemicals shorten the life of pipes and machinery furthermore limescale prevention techniques in industrial scale like ion exchange or reverse osmosis require expensive equipment and heavy maintenance in this paper an electronic antifouling device is presented which not only prevents limescale formation but also removes existing scale in plumbing tubes at insignificant energy consumption induction of a radio frequency alternating electric field rfaef in water at a specific range of frequency and antenna voltage along with its distinct sinewave waveform changes the way minerals precipitate minimizing hard lime scale by producing instead a non adherent mineral powder in the bulk water moreover the unsaturated solution that is created along with enhanced carbon dioxide production dissolves gradually the existing scale in plumbing tubes furthermore the rfaef inductance device demonstrates a major improvement over other pulsed power systems proving this electronic antifouling technique suitable for both hard and soft waters as well as for large scale applications keywords antifouling technology electronic descaling device limescale prevention plumbing tube radio frequency alternating electric field 1 introduction scale is the well known crusty chalky build up that forms when hard water is being processed in heat transfer equipment such as heat exchangers condensers evaporators cooling towers boilers pipe walls as well as household appliances scale composition differs from application to application depending on the mineral content of the utilized water the most common component of scale though is calcium carbonate caco3 which occurs naturally as an ingredient of chalk limestone and marble when hard water is pumped into heat transfer equipment calcium and bicarbonate ions precipitate due to the changes in solubility forming hard deposits limescale on the heat transfer surfaces clogging pipes and manifolds reaction 1 a phenomenon traditionally called fouling 1 3 1 ca2 2hco3 caco3 s h2o co2 g fouling problems are of major concern to many industries using water and heat examples include petroleum food marine mining air compressor and air separation industries once scale forms on a heat transfer surface at least two major problems associated with the scale occur the first problem is the deterioration of the heat transfer equipment performance due to the much lower thermal conductivity of scale compared to that of pipe materials 4 6 the second major problem is that a small change in tube diameter substantially increases the pressure drop across the water piping system 7 scale creates also secondary problems of a big concern such as rust accumulation leading to corrosion increased growth of bacteria in drinking water 8 9 high machinery maintenance cost and decreased productivity due to increasing production downtime while equipment is repaired and maintained equipment failure or even total damage 2 6 thus it is self evident that if one can reduce or prevent fouling in heat transfer equipment the savings in energy maintenance and replacement of equipment will be truly significant among the current techniques to prevent fouling is the use of scale inhibiting chemicals such as dispersing or chelating compounds that chemically grip dissolved cations thus neutralizing them ion exchange and reverse osmosis are also used to reduce water hardness alkalinity and silica level 2 3 however this equipment is expensive in industrial scale and requires heavy maintenance for proper operation furthermore once fouling occurs in the piping system scales need to be removed by using several cleaning techniques like aggressive acidic chemicals scraping hydro blasting sand blasting or the use of metal or nylon brushes the latter operations incur downtime and repair costs while they also shorten the life of the pipes and the machinery moreover all the above scale removing techniques pose danger on both human health and the environment with accidental spills or accumulated chemical residues over a long period of time 10 11 thus there is an increasing need for a new environmentally safe and economically feasible process in cleaning and maintenance of heat transfer equipment and piping systems in recent years several physical water treatment methods have been developed in order to mitigate mineral fouling with the use of non chemical processes such as solenoid coils 12 13 magnetic fields 14 16 catalytic material 17 18 electrolysis 19 and ultrasound 20 21 the use of pulsed power systems has also been increasingly reported with very promising results 22 26 pulsed power devices impart electro magnetic fields into the heating or cooling water having a direct effect in preventing mineral scale formation on equipment surfaces while also significantly reducing biofilms present in the piping systems 22 26 the electric signal changes the way minerals in the water precipitate thus the minerals form suspended clusters that turn into stable crystals when temperature or pressure changes occur avoiding hard lime scale by producing instead a non adherent mineral powder in the bulk water that is readily filterable and easily removed 25 26 the water chemistry maintained by pulse powered technology is non corrosive operating at the saturation point of calcium carbonate 27 29 pulsed power techniques however do not work effectively on soft water since the technology is based on changing the way minerals in the water precipitate thus hard water is required in order to dissolve limescale deposits moreover the energy consumption required for large scale applications may become significant 12 30 after almost 15 years of continual research and development experimentation a novel electronic antifouling device has been developed which not only presents the beneficial advantages of the above described similar techniques but also overcomes the respective disadvantages in more details the latter electronic antifouling device works very effectively not only on hard water but also on very soft water thus the objective of this paper is firstly to demonstrate the capability of the electronic antifouling device to prevent limescale formation in a plumbing tube under conditions of high water hardness concentration secondly to demonstrate the capability of the latter electronic device to remove existing scale in plumbing tubes utilizing not only hard but also soft water 2 materials and methods 2 1 the electronic antifouling device the electronic antifouling device fig 1 is a radio frequency alternating electric field rfaef inductance utility which operates at 12 v and induces a 300 v pure alternating electric field directly in water the magnetic induction is practically zero 1 10 12 gauss the device s output produces a frequency of 750 khz medium frequency radio band with the aid of an advanced oscillator while there is no need for an earth electrode furthermore the alternating electric field is 100 of the sinewave type producing a minimum number of harmonic frequencies the major advantage of this technique is its maximum energy efficiency since 98 of the electric field strength is induced in the aqueous phase resulting in truly insignificant energy consumption 4 w 2 2 experimental installations materials and procedure two identical experimental installations fig 2 were set up each of them consisting of a 10 l water vessel an electric water recirculation pump flow rate 9 11 l min a 10 cm long ½ in plumbing tube inner diameter 1 27 cm and all the necessary tubing and connection accessories the two installations worked simultaneously at each experimental run the first of them ran without the rfaef inductance device while the second one ran with the latter device fit on the plumbing tube fig 2 all the experiments were performed at ambient temperature 18 28 c in order to enhance the formation of limescale by assisting attraction of the calcium positive ions ca2 on the inner surface of the plumbing tubes the latter tubes of both installations were electrically grounded fig 2 calcium chloride cacl2 and sodium bicarbonate nahco3 from fischer scientific were utilized in order to prepare aqueous solutions of the desired total hardness concentration total alkalinity and total hardness concentrations were determined according to astm analysis methods 31 while ph and conductivity were measured by utilizing a hanna hi 8424 ph meter and a conductivity meter wtw lf 191 conduktometer respectively a portable oscilloscope fluke 123 industrial scopemeter was used in order to measure alternating electric field voltage and waveform total settled solids tss was collected by filtering with 0 45 μm pore filter the solids were then washed with deionized water and left to dry in an oven 60 c for 24 h scale solids were collected by scratching with a brush the latter solids were also collected on a 45 μm pore filter washed with deionized water and left to dry in an oven 60 c for 24 h finally x ray diffraction xrd was utilized in order to analyze the several crystalline phases of the scales and the settled solids xrd analysis was performed at the department of mining and metallurgical engineering at the national technical university of athens ntua in more details powder xrd analysis was performed on a bruker d8 focus x ray diffractometer operating with cukα radiation the samples were step scanned from 5 to 70 2θ at a step of 0 02 and step time of 1 s the major peaks of the xrd pattern were identified based on reference patterns calculated from crystal structure data crystallography open database 2 2 1 scale prevention experimental procedure the first experiment was conducted with the two installations fig 2 running simultaneously and continually until an adequate scale formation was built up on the inner surface of the first installation plumbing tube water of a very high hardness concentration table 1 and brand new scale free plumbing tubes fig 3 a were utilized the aim of this experiment was to demonstrate the capability of the rfaef inductance device to keep the respective plumbing tube clear of limescale at all times due to the continual caco3 precipitation and subsequent drop of total hardness the water content in both vessels was being replaced with a freshly prepared one at the end of each week 2 2 2 scale removal experimental procedure a series of experiments followed utilizing this time plumbing tubes rich in scale formation fig 3 b all the above tubes originated from a one meter long plumbing tube that had been in use for over 20 years in a rural area prior to the experimental run the plumbing tubes were washed inside with tap water in order to remove any non adherent particles the experimental installations fig 2 ran once more simultaneously until a satisfactory removal of scale was observed in the plumbing tube of the second installation with the rfaef inductance device on hard water was prepared dissolving the proper amounts of cacl2 and nahco3 in deionized water while tap water was used in case of soft water experimentation 3 results and discussion 3 1 scale prevention experiment the two installations ran simultaneously for 6 months 24 weeks non stop under the same water conditions table 1 myriads of tiny bubbles were observed in the water of the second installation with the rfaef inductance device on due to the strong presence of carbon dioxide gas reaction 1 the latter phenomenon was not observed in the first experimental installation at the end of the 24th week the experiment was paused and the plumbing tubes were removed on the inner surface of the first installation plumbing tube a scale layer of nearly 1 0 mm was built up that was very hard to remove by scratching at the same time the inner surface of the second installation plumbing tube was only partially covered several spots by a thin layer of limescale that could be very easily removed by washing fig 4 presents photos of the plumbing tube cross sections revealing the above findings before the photos were taken the plumbing tubes were washed inside with tap water in order to remove the slightly adherent particles xrd analysis fig 5 revealed that the limescale of the first installation plumbing tube fig 4 a consisted almost entirely of calcite the most common polymorph of natural calcium carbonate 32 traces of a magnesium carbonate crystalline formation were also identified by comparing the two photos fig 4 it can be safely concluded that the induced rfaef changed indeed the way calcium carbonate precipitates in water moreover it is evident that the above alternating electric field generated an increased number of inter ionic species collisions among calcium cations and bicarbonate anions fig 1 c which resulted in the formation of stable clusters nuclei of calcium carbonate in bulk water thus the formation of hard lime scale on the metal surface was minimized instead a non adherent powder was created the latter results come in accordance with a phenomenon that has already been described and theoretically approached by other researchers working on pulsed power systems 7 24 however the rfaef inductance device fig 1 demonstrates a major improvement over the above mentioned pulsed power systems 22 26 as it imparts a considerable higher energy level into the water due to the specific combination of high frequency 0 65 1 1 mhz and high antenna voltage 290 312 v along with its distinct alternating electric field waveform sinewave thus as indeed verified by experiments and field measurements 98 of the electric field strength is induced in the aqueous phase contrarily to only around 20 of the above mentioned pulsed power systems 22 26 furthermore the created electric field can be measurable in a one 1 meter distance away from the antenna left and right as opposed to only a few millimeters in the previous pulsed power systems as a consequence the rfaef inductance device proves to be much more efficient compared to other pulsed power systems 22 26 making this electronic antifouling technique suitable not only for hard but also for soft waters as well as suitable for large scale applications 3 2 scale removal experiments 3 2 1 hard water experiment scale rich plumbing tubes fig 3 b were employed this time xrd analysis of the scale fig 6 identified four 4 main crystalline structures namely aragonite caco3 magnesite mgco3 dolomite camg co3 2 and cristobalite ii sio2 hard water was prepared and utilized for the first experimental run table 2 the experimental installations ran for a period of 48 days until a satisfactory removal of scale was observed in the plumbing tube of the second installation with the rfaef inductance device on at the same time the scale in the first installation plumbing tube remained essentially unchanged fig 7 from the beginning of the experiment it was evident by the myriads of existing bubbles that the rfaef inductance device enhanced reaction 1 in the bulk solution causing the immediate release of carbon dioxide thus unsaturated solution was created by the process of homogeneous crystallization which along with carbon dioxide dissolved removed gradually the existing surface scale that precipitated then in bulk solution ending up on the bottom of the water vessel the settled solids were obvious to the naked eye table 2 shows that the drop of alkalinity total hardness and conductivity was slightly higher in the second experimental installation however the mass of total settled solids tss was more than tenfold higher compared to the first installation revealing the transfer of scale from the surface of the plumbing tube to the bottom of the water vessel xrd analysis of the settled solids fig 8 identified vaterite μ caco3 silicon oxide sio2 and magnesium carbonate mgco3 as the main crystalline phases vaterite a metastable phase of calcium carbonate is less stable than either calcite or aragonite and can easily convert to calcite after exposure to water at ambient conditions 30 from the above analysis it can be concluded that aragonite caco3 magnesite mgco3 and dolomite camg co3 2 found initially in the scale figs figure 3 b figure 6 were gradually dissolved during the course of the experiment while the liberated calcium and magnesium ions precipitated then as vaterite or even possibly as calcite and magnesium carbonate respectively meanwhile large pieces of the scale silica particles were detached from the wall of the plumbing tube and settled down on the bottom of the vessel the existence of a high proportion of impurities in scale such as silica particles fig 6 may have attributed to the relatively long time for scale removal furthermore it is well known that aragonite the second most common polymorph of natural calcium carbonate after calcite forms hard and dense deposits leading to difficult scale removal 7 32 3 2 2 soft water experiment soft water was utilized for the second experiment moreover tap water from the city s water supply network athens greece was tested table 3 presents the main physico chemical characteristics of this water before and after the experimental runs in this experiment it took longer time for the rfaef inductance device to satisfactorily dissolve remove the scale from the plumbing tube second installation meanwhile and as actually expected no essential change was observed in the scale of the first experimental installation plumbing tube fig 9 presents photos of the plumbing tubes 72 days after continual experimentation the latter finding comes in accordance with the above described scale dissolving mechanism softer water is characterized by a lower calcium ion ca2 concentration thus the production rate of carbon dioxide reaction 1 is lower compared to hard water being unsaturated water dissolves the existing scale on the metal surface however at a lower rate leading thus to a prolonged time for full scale removal as also in the previous experiment the drop of alkalinity total hardness and conductivity was slightly higher in the second experimental installation table 3 however the mass of total settled solids tss in the second experimental installation was once more a lot higher 16 times compared to the first installation table 3 revealing again the transfer of scale solids from the surface of the plumbing tube to the bottom of the water vessel future work will focus on large scale applications industry municipal drinking water distribution systems and the research and development of advanced electronic antifouling devices 4 conclusions an electronic antifouling device which induced a radio frequency alternating electric field in water at a specific range of frequency and antenna voltage along with its distinct waveform sinewave proved very efficient in preventing limescale formation in a plumbing tube while utilizing highly hard water furthermore the same electronic antifouling device proved also very efficient in removing existing scale from plumbing tubes using not only hard but also soft water by utilizing the above electronic antifouling technique removal and or prevention of limescale in plumbing tubes can be achieved at almost negligible energy consumption acknowledgements ifb interexperts company www interexperts gr

14576,modern technologies in wastewater treatment can produce high quality effluents therefore wastewater is now considered a valuable product suitable for reuse however water reuse needs to be regulated based on applicable and legally binding guidelines therefore the lack of a regulatory framework hampers this practice and its benefits the czech republic as many other countries has an absent water reuse legislation in this study a pilot scale tertiary treatment was installed at milevsko waste water treatment plant wwtp in south bohemia 20 000 p e to demonstrate the effluent quality that can be achieved and evaluate the reuse potential especially on non potable applications such as industry and irrigation wwtp secondary effluent was treated by three separated technologies dissolved air flotation daf sand filter and filtra lite filter followed by ultraviolet uv disinfection results on water quality were compared to czech standards for drinking and non drinking water and to some international benchmark regulations for water reuse our results have led us to initiate the introduction of legislation regulating wastewater reuse in the czech water management framework keywords wastewater reuse industrial reuse tertiary treatment uv disinfection legislation 1 introduction wastewater reuse has become a desirable manner of dealing with this product due to its fairly high quality and the sustainable use of the urban water resources applications for reuse are quite diverse but an essential part in this process is the implementation of valid and binding legislation that sets clear policy for wastewater reuse often effluent quality not only ensures adequate protection of recipient waters but in some cases exceeds the requirements of environmental protection an extending shortage of drinking and fresh water coupled with steadily increasing potable water prices is leading to widespread investigation of wwtp effluent reuse options 1 various modifications to wwtp technology can produce different qualities of treated wastewater to suit particular reuse requirements 2 3 for each application of treated wastewater reuse safety criteria must be established and the potential risks associated with these processes must be defined according to world health organisation guidelines who 4 5 in europe treated wastewater has to comply with both eu and national water law and depending on the final use of the treated water it would have to comply with many other eu directives applicable legislation must consist of several fundamental components which can be divided into basic parts defined terms based on guidelines of the who specified wastewater reuse areas raw material quality for specific applications and regions and processes able to achieve the required quality to facilitate this process a pilot plant project assessing three different simple tertiary treatment devices was installed in a wwtp with a capacity of 20 000 pe located in south bohemia czech republic to ensure hygienization of the effluent an uv unit was used downstream of all devices under evaluation data from these experiments were compared with existing legislative requirements from the czech republic as well as the u s and european guidelines for wastewater reuse the main aim of this project is to demonstrate the achievable quality of real wwtp effluent and evaluate its potential for reuse in the industrial sector mainly additionally we aspired to characterize and compare the removal efficiency of water quality indicator parameters of the three simple tertiary treatment devices employed water reuse is not a current practice in the czech republic although the technologies to produce clean effluents are available up to now the effluent of wwtps are discharged into recipient waters usually rivers or streams nearby the plant only applying extra measurements to improve the quality of the effluent when the discharge is made on protected or sensitive areas 7 8 in this pilot plant project we tested three devices for removal of residual pollution from wwtp effluent including a separation process by daf unit a sand filter and a filtra lite filter containing expanded crushed clay material the performance of these devices was improved with a downstream uv reactor to provide hygienization 9 15 the reason for filtration s dominance in the pilot systems is the maturity of this technology along with the low price in comparison with newer technologies like membranes 16 18 although membrane technologies were not in the scope of our research the particular three devices in the study were chosen because daf is commonly used in early stages of wastewater treatment but to the best of our knowledge has not been used as a tertiary treatment especially in the czech republic filtra lite is a more recent technology that is not widely spread yet however it is promoted as a safe and reliable filtration system that was created 20 years ago in cooperation with technical institutes and water experts having now many successful case studies sand filter is a common and widespread tertiary treatment technology so it was important to compare its results with the more innovative technologies the experiments were adapted to water treatment standards in the czech republic and results obtained were compared to the requirements for industrial and irrigation use as well as drinking water despite the fact that achieving drinking water quality was not the aim of the experiment neither was expected lastly the comparison was also made to examples of wastewater reuse guidelines abroad 2 methods a pilot plant of tertiary treatment was installed in the facilities of the wwtp of milevsko in south bohemia region in the czech republic the three treatments tested were 1 separation after coagulation by daf 2 sand filtration and 3 filtra lite filtration all processes used secondary clarifier effluent as influent which had already passed through a coagulation flocculation process according to fig 1 for the coagulation flotation stage 100 mg l of 40 water solution of ferric sulphate pix 113 was dosed as a coagulant rapid homogenization was achieved in the first mixing area while the subsequent mixing area promoted floc formation with a slow mixing gradient the flotation unit s coagulant dosing and mixing area was utilized as a common pre treatment for all devices a majority of the mixture 7 5 m3 remained in the coagulation area for further separation by daf unit however 0 5 m3 were diverted to feed each of the experimental filtration units the sand filter was composed of fine fp1 sand 0 5 1 mm diameter particles the sand layer was 1 6 m thick and the filters had a leopold type s gravitational drainage system to ensure uniform water flow and minimize channelling inflow entered the filtration unit 40 cm above the packed filtration material and was regulated by a floating flow meter system the filtra lite filtration is based on clay material expanded at 1200 c and subsequently crushed into specifically sized particles the filter applied in this project employed two layers the lower one of higher density particles 0 8 1 6 mm diameter and the upper one of lower density particles 1 5 2 5 mm diameter each layer was 0 8 m thick the three processes were not working parallely at the same time but were working with few hours difference always using the same water as influent the processes were applied alternately using working cycles the secondary clarifier effluent of the wwtp was stored in an exchange vessel of 30 m3 at 16 18 c and water quality was tested and proven to be consistent when supplied to each one of the three processes from there the pilot plant was fed on 5 h cycles for each treatment with sampling performed every 30 min for each device 13 cycles were run meaning 130 samples were taken analysed and considered for the results here presented uv radiation was applied after each process as disinfection method using a low pressure lifeuvl01xxsp ii lamp of 254 nm wavelength the pilot study was performed during spring summer 2016 on a timespan of 4 months 2 1 physico chemical analysis samples taken were analysed on site for turbidity colour and total iron using mobile colorimeter and for ph and temperature using mobile probes these parameters were measured again in laboratory under more controlled circumstances to monitor their stability and accuracy physical and chemical parameters such as orthophosphate chemical oxygen demand cod and ammonia nitrogen were analysed in the laboratory on site the measurements were done with dr 890 colorimeter hach and ph oximeter wtw multiline p3 the analyses carried on in the laboratory were based on standard methods 19 results are reported in the superior part of table 1 2 2 microbiological analysis the organisms used as indicators of contamination were total coliforms escherichia coli intestinal enterococci and colonies at 22 c as shown on fig 1 quality analyses were made on samples of the influent labelled as sampling point 1 samples of the effluent of each tertiary process labelled as 2a 2b 2c and samples of each of the previous effluents after the uv disinfection had taken place labelled as 3a 3b and 3c respectively for total coliforms the count was done in ufc 100 ml performed by membrane filtration technique 20 a 100 ml portion of the water sample with its appropriate dilutions passed through a 0 45 μm membrane filter and was placed in a plate with lactose containing agar medium m fc agar the plates were incubated for 18 24 h at temperature of 44 2 c and after that the colonies could be counted for e coli 100 ml samples with their appropriate dilutions were filtrated trough a 0 45 μm membrane and then kept for liquid cultivation in a medium with mug 4 methylumbelliferyl β d glucuronide during 2 4 h at a temperature of 36 2 c the count was made exposing the cultivated filter to an uv lamp with a wavelenght of 365 nm where the colonies were confirmed as e coli because of their fluorescence 20 intestinal enterococci count were also made by membrane filtration of the diluted sample and later cultivated in a solid medium sodium azide and 2 3 5 tri phenyltetrazole chloride the cultivation takes place at a temperature of 36 2 c for 44 2 h enterococci are counted as presumptive enterococci as typical colonies are considered all the red chestnut and pink colonies for confirmation the filters were pressed to bile aesculin azide agar and cultivated at 44 2 c for 2 h colonies counted were the ones with brown to black colour 21 for colonies at 22 c the samples were diluted accordingly and 1 ml was placed in a dish containing agar with yeast extract still liquid at 45 3 c after the agar with the sample has solidified the dishes were cultivated at 22 2 c for 68 4 h the colony making units were identified and counted in units per 1 ml 22 results are reported in the inferior part of table 1 3 results and discussion the aim of the project was to compare tertiary treatment processes and monitor the effluent quality from each device to analyse the factors that impacted and influenced the quality of the effluent delivered during the monitoring we found that the flotation unit provided long term stable effluent quality with a completely automated process whereas both filtering processes showed a continuous increase in the quality of the effluent on each filtration cycle this improvement in the effluent quality over time is due to a combination of factors being the microbial activity one of the most important but mainly because of the clogging of the filter reducing the pore space and increasing the filtering activity although the final effluent quality was quite high the short filtration cycles until the filter needed to be backwashed and the unstable quality of the effluent along the cycle represent disadvantages for the filtration technologies uv disinfection confirmed its specified efficiency in the removal of organic and microbial pollution improving the great majority of the parameters of all effluents the results in table 1 show that the tertiary treatments in question had less effectiveness in the improvement of physical chemical parameters than in microbiological ones due to coagulant use the total iron increased in all samples compared to the secondary effluent and it was not removed completely by any of the three technologies total iron content even resulted in increased turbidity and colour and in some samples also lowered the ph value the content of iron could also affect the effectiveness of the uv disinfection system as iron particles directly absorb uv radiation and can precipitate on the surface of the sleeves that cover the uv lamps 23 lowering their effective irradiance 3 1 water quality the daf unit showed the lowest removal rates of physical chemical impurities this highly influenced the increased turbidity and colour caused by the addition of ferric chloride during the coagulation process residual iron concentrations were the highest after the daf process possibly because the bubbles of the system damaged the consistency of the flocs hampering the effective iron removal also cod concentration did not decrease significantly showing again the highest concentrations among the three technologies tested however the effluent after passing through uv disinfection improved significantly and cod levels were comparable with the quality of the filtration methods disinfection by uv was effective but did not reach the disinfection levels of the filtration effluents as complete inactivation was only achieved for e coli sand filtration produced an effluent with much better characteristics the physical parameters were improved in turbidity and colour and the concentrations of the chemical parameters were lowered with success in terms on microbial inactivation the sand filter process before uv disinfection provided inactivation rates of 97 for all microbial species studied however after uv disinfection potable water requirements were met for the four microorganisms studied the uv radiation improved the quality by lowering the turbidity levels and cod concentration however the colour iron phosphate and ammonia concentrations increased in a small measure the filtra lite filter produced the best quality effluent in general terms the single filtering process decreased significantly turbidity and colour as well as the chemical parameters however the microbial content was still quite elevated compared with the effluent after sand filtration which was somehow expected because the sand particles were smaller than the clay ones in the filtra lite unit after the uv process the turbidity and colour showed a slight increase as a result of breaking very small flocs that passed through the filtration stage this on one hand increased the suspended material therefore the turbidity but on the other hand it also made the embedded microbial pollution vulnerable to the uv disinfection process the effluent in chemical and microbiological parameters presented very low concentrations of the tested compounds especially in terms of phosphate and residual iron that were the lowest achieved complete disinfection was also reached for all microorganisms tested the uv disinfection process not only contributed to the microbial inactivation but also impacted other parameters depending on the nature of the suspended or dissolved solids uv radiation can degrade organic compounds by means of direct photolysis by light absorption of compounds that are photolabile indirect photolysis is also possible if oxidants such as oh are produced during uv photolysis of the water components such as dissolved organic matter dom 24 these reactions can result in a lower concentration of some compounds while increasing the concentration of others as product of the photolysis process 3 2 efficiency comparison the removal efficiency was monitored for each device and parameter the comparisons are divided by pollution character into physical chemical fig 2 and microbiological fig 3 categories and are distinguished by separation technology with and without uv disinfection 3 3 comparison to normative and legislation requirements the results obtained were compared with currently valid guidelines for water use and reuse in the european union both legally and non legally binding table 2 the main scope was to compare it with the czech legislative standards for drinking water and non potable water bearing in mind the results were expected to reach only non drinking water limits this is because we monitored some of the most important microbiological parameters but certainly not all the required ones to ensure drinking water quality it is important to mention that even if the water quality parameters monitored would have reached the limits for drinking water the reuse of the effluent for this purpose would not be recommended nor approved because drinking water requires specific and more rigorous advanced treatment processes the most important document that was compared with the effluent quality was the water law 25 connected to the according government decree which specifies drinking water requirements 26 comparisons of effluent quality with non potable requirements were based on czech regulations for irrigation 27 and industrial cooling systems 28 as currently there is no legislation allowing the reuse of treated wastewater for any purpose and therefore this option is not yet in practice the quality of the effluent from the tertiary treatment pilot project at milevsko wwtp did not fully meet drinking water requirements with any of the three processes tested not even after uv disinfection was applied however sand and filtra lite processes coupled with uv radiation achieved complete disinfection as required by law for drinking water quality the residual iron was successfully removed on the filtra lite plus uv disinfection process but unfortunately none of the effluents achieved drinking water levels of colour turbidity and cod requirements for irrigation and industrial cooling systems are less stringent and include fewer parameters than potable water besides according to üstün et al 29 the cost of reusing water for irrigation would cost one tenth of the current water distribution cost permissible turbidity levels for irrigation were not achieved in any of the processes after uv disinfection while ph and total iron levels were achieved in all of them acceptable levels for all microbiological parameters were met by all processes when coupled with uv disinfection requirements for industrial cooling systems were reached in all processes to comply with the european union guidelines for drinking water 30 31 is clear that a more effective rigorous and especialised tertiary treatment would have to be applied as the physico chemical parameters will never be met by simple flotation or filtration processes however the uv disinfection proved to be effective in the inactivation of the microorganisms tested in italy country in the european union where wastewater reuse is an on going practice a national decree 32 has set the minimum requirements to reuse water for non potable uses both effluents from the filtration processes coupled with uv comply with the requirements in the italian decree in italy water reuse is a practice that is getting more popular with time and many regions are currently applying it with limits that are even more stringent than the national decree statutes according to the regional legislation framework that adds up to the national one nowadays more countries have valid legislation regulating allowable wastewater reuse based on world health organisation who guidelines but one of the benchmark organisations for environmental law remains to be the u s environmental protection agency epa because of the widespread application of its legislative requirements for reclaimed water the u s epa guidelines for wastewater reuse include requirements for all industrial reuse with specified limits 6 focusing on industrial reuse for cooling systems there is a specification of permissible levels of many other parameters aside from the ones comprised in the european union guidelines and treatment processes must include disinfection in every case interestingly although simple tertiary treatments like the ones used in milevsko wwtp can achieve the quality requirements for industrial uses specified in the czech law requirements the reuse of the treated effluent is not legally permitted for industrial or any other purpose additionally czech legal framework does not focus on the same parameters as u s epa and possibly these parameters should be also discussed in negotiations about legislation for wastewater reuse 4 conclusions water quality of tertiary effluent complied with the requirements for industrial cooling systems uv disinfection improved the effluent quality and with a treatment to decrease the turbidity such as a membrane filtering the effluent could also comply with irrigation requirements the absent legislation that allows and regulates water reuse hampers the possibility to use these effluents accordingly water reuse is now a need in the czech republic and countries where it is not yet a reality tertiary treatments can reduce residual pollution from wwtp effluents for its reuse however the efficiency depends on the technology applied as different types of reuse will require different water quality acknowledgement the studies have been supported by foundation fund veolia czech republic and financial support from specific university research msmt no 21 2013 
14576,modern technologies in wastewater treatment can produce high quality effluents therefore wastewater is now considered a valuable product suitable for reuse however water reuse needs to be regulated based on applicable and legally binding guidelines therefore the lack of a regulatory framework hampers this practice and its benefits the czech republic as many other countries has an absent water reuse legislation in this study a pilot scale tertiary treatment was installed at milevsko waste water treatment plant wwtp in south bohemia 20 000 p e to demonstrate the effluent quality that can be achieved and evaluate the reuse potential especially on non potable applications such as industry and irrigation wwtp secondary effluent was treated by three separated technologies dissolved air flotation daf sand filter and filtra lite filter followed by ultraviolet uv disinfection results on water quality were compared to czech standards for drinking and non drinking water and to some international benchmark regulations for water reuse our results have led us to initiate the introduction of legislation regulating wastewater reuse in the czech water management framework keywords wastewater reuse industrial reuse tertiary treatment uv disinfection legislation 1 introduction wastewater reuse has become a desirable manner of dealing with this product due to its fairly high quality and the sustainable use of the urban water resources applications for reuse are quite diverse but an essential part in this process is the implementation of valid and binding legislation that sets clear policy for wastewater reuse often effluent quality not only ensures adequate protection of recipient waters but in some cases exceeds the requirements of environmental protection an extending shortage of drinking and fresh water coupled with steadily increasing potable water prices is leading to widespread investigation of wwtp effluent reuse options 1 various modifications to wwtp technology can produce different qualities of treated wastewater to suit particular reuse requirements 2 3 for each application of treated wastewater reuse safety criteria must be established and the potential risks associated with these processes must be defined according to world health organisation guidelines who 4 5 in europe treated wastewater has to comply with both eu and national water law and depending on the final use of the treated water it would have to comply with many other eu directives applicable legislation must consist of several fundamental components which can be divided into basic parts defined terms based on guidelines of the who specified wastewater reuse areas raw material quality for specific applications and regions and processes able to achieve the required quality to facilitate this process a pilot plant project assessing three different simple tertiary treatment devices was installed in a wwtp with a capacity of 20 000 pe located in south bohemia czech republic to ensure hygienization of the effluent an uv unit was used downstream of all devices under evaluation data from these experiments were compared with existing legislative requirements from the czech republic as well as the u s and european guidelines for wastewater reuse the main aim of this project is to demonstrate the achievable quality of real wwtp effluent and evaluate its

14577,this study reports the novel use of alkaline waste material from the alumina refining industry bayer liquor and precipitates formed by the seawater neutralisation of bayer liquor for the neutralisation of acid mine drainage amd water the hypothesis was that utilization of waste to treat waste can potentially result in environmental and economic benefits the performance of bayer liquor and bayer precipitate was compared with conventional alkalis used for amd neutralisation such as lime ca oh 2 sodium hydroxide naoh and sodium carbonate na2co3 target ions to remove from the amd solution included al 1233 mg l cu 77 26 mg l fe 16 7 mg l ni 1 54 mg l mn 161 5 mg l and zn 48 89 mg l both alumina industry wastes were shown to produce treated water with acceptable discharge limits for all metals except mn nevertheless bayer precipitate was shown to have an enhanced ability to remove manganese at lower ph 6 5 7 5 relative to lime with residual mn concentrations of 32 30 and 85 40 mg l respectively manganese discharge limits were challenging to meet due to ph values 9 being required wherein not only aluminium species redissolved but also the ph was not compatible with discharge regulations mechanistically larger precipitates were found to positively influence the removal of heavy metals with lime and bayer precipitates forming the largest precipitates overall bayer precipitate was found to be a potential alternative for the treatment of amd water keywords acid mine drainage bauxite residue neutralisation bayer liquor bayer sprecipitates 1 introduction acid mine drainage amd is a challenging environmental problem created by numerous mining operations 1 2 in the presence of oxygen water and oxidising bacteria the oxidation of pyrite and other sulphide minerals in mine wastes occur which leads to the formation of acid mine drainage 1 3 the pyrite oxidation is a complex process resulting in release of hydrogen sulphate and ferrous ions eq 1 4 in oxygenated water ferrous iron fe2 is oxidised to ferric iron fe3 eq 2 which either further reacts with pyrite to produce more ferrous iron and acidity eq 3 or precipitates as ochre fe oh 3 eq 4 4 in waste rocks a variety of other metal sulphides can also be oxidised in the presence of oxygen and water eq 5 and may release metals such as arsenic cadmium zinc copper and lead which can ultimately contaminate groundwater making it unsuitable for drinking and agricultural purposes 5 nearby waterways can also be affected if run off events occur and situations exist wherein significant fish and crustacean kills have been observed due to low ph conditions 6 7 the toxic characteristics of amd can permanently damage surrounding ecosystems thus suitable management and treatment methods to remediate affected water bodies are required 5 1 2 f e s 2 s 2 h 2 o l 7 o 2 g 2 f e 2 a q 4 s o 4 2 a q 4 h a q 2 2 f e 2 a q 2 h a q 1 2 o 2 g 2 f e 3 a q h 2 o l 3 15 f e 2 a q 16 h a q 2 s o 4 2 a q 2 f e 3

passive systems based on their requirements for chemical addition infrastructure maintenance and monitoring a variety of passive treatment systems such as aerobic wetlands anaerobic or compost wetlands 8 vertical flow wetlands amd treatment ponds bioreactors and permeable reactive barriers 5 9 10 are available to treat acid mine drainage however the requirement of relatively large land area high installation cost and system failure poor design winter conditions or due to accumulation of metal hydroxides are the major disadvantages associated with these treatment systems active treatment methods of acid mine drainage water typically involve alkali addition in order to raise the ph to between 6 and 9 11 13 in this latter ph range the concentrations of dissolved metals generally decreases due to the formation of insoluble metal hydroxides and oxyhydroxides 14 15 the rate and degree of metal precipitation depends upon their concentration identity and complex interaction between dissolved species in water 16 for example in an oxygen rich environment the recommended ph for iron fe3 precipitation is 3 5 4 0 while in oxygen poor environments a ph of 8 5 is required 14 manganese mn precipitation is dependent upon the oxidation state present but will generally precipitate at ph 9 a value which is typically higher than recommended water discharge limits 14 if the iron concentration in water is significantly higher than manganese it may be removed with iron at ph 8 due to co precipitation 14 aluminium al generally precipitates at ph 5 but this element enters back into solution at ph 9 0 as soluble aluminate ions al oh 4 17 therefore increasing the ph to 9 to remove mn can result in the dissolution of aluminium precipitates divalent metal ions such as nickel ni2 and zinc zn2 precipitate at ph values ranging from 8 to 9 18 various alkalis like lime ca oh 2 sodium hydroxide naoh and sodium carbonate na2co3 have been used to modify ph and remove heavy metals from amd water as precipitates 19 20 in some cases limestone caco3 was employed and removed 90 of heavy metals such as cd pb zn ni cu and cr iii from solutions at ph 8 5 21 lime is arguably the most widely used alkali applied to remediate acid mine drainage solutions 22 due mainly to its relatively low cost availability and simplicity of treatment plant 23 a disadvantage of the process is the voluminous sludge that is produced sludge typically settles slowly to 10 of the volume of water treated albeit as much as 50 sludge volume has been observed 23 the combination of slow settling rate low sludge density and excessive volumes of sludge formed from the neutralisation process can result in a costly process bosman 23 reviewed the variability of mine water and resultant sludge compositions and the benefits of using high density sludge recovery methods to improve sludge characteristics an analysis of amd water compositions from six different south african mines showed large variations in ph 1 8 5 0 calcium 30 800 mg l magnesium 10 660 mg l ferrous iron 5 1250 mg l ferric iron 5 3350 mg l aluminium 2 200 mg l and sulphate 600 13390 mg l concentrations of heavy metals were not provided 23 this variability in amd water quality illustrates the difficulties in developing a single treatment process for all amd waters the problem is further escalated when variations in mine water compositions at the same mine site are considered as reported by edraki et al 16 for ten water holding areas at mount morgan mine the following variations were observed across the ten sites at mount morgan ph 2 6 3 8 sulphate 8390 56240 mg l aluminium 209 3074 mg l calcium 426 514 mg l magnesium 1051 6101 mg l iron 13 1487 mg l sodium 106 830 mg l copper 3 27 138 mg l manganese 51 1 355 mg l and zinc 7 11 81 4 mg l from the previous discussion it can be seen that amd solutions are inherently composed of many dissolved components 24 and thus the optimal alkali addition strategy may not be the same for all amd types additionally the question arises as to the potential benefits of employing alternate alkaline solutions or materials 19 25 26 an innovative means of treating amd solutions may involve the application of alkaline solutions or materials produced as waste products from other major industries for example bauxite refining produces large volumes of highly alkaline ph 13 waste 1 1 5 t of red mud slurry produced for every tonne of alumina produced 27 28 many researchers have reported the use of bauxite refinery residue solid portion of red mud to treat acid mine drainage neutralisation of the acid and precipitation or adsorption of heavy metals however large volumes of solid waste is produced that requires subsequent disposal and capping to prevent metals leaching 29 33 very little research has been completed on the use of red mud liquor and seawater derivatives bayer precipitate to treat acid mine drainage 34 as well as comparisons of the performance of bauxite refinery wastes with commercially used materials therefore this research will focus on comparing the use of bayer liquor and bayer precipitates to treat amd with conventionally used alkali seawater neutralisation of bayer liquor results in the formation of bayer precipitates comprising of hydrotalcite mg6al2 oh 16 co3 4h2o and calcium carbonate species caco3 35 36 due to the causticity of these waste materials they may prove an interesting alternative to the traditional application of lime for treating amd waters 11 34 it is envisioned that the use of these cleaner wastes from bauxite residues will produce similar volumes of waste to traditional neutralisation agents such as lime with similar or improved metal removal capacities due to the presence of hydrotalcite in the bayer precipitate a known adsorbent material 37 the fact that a region such as queensland contains not only a substantial bauxite refining industry 38 39 but also numerous acid mine drainage problems generated by the mining industry 40 42 makes this outlined approach attractive therefore the aim of this study was to compare the performance of bayer liquor and bayer precipitates with respect to material requirements and discharge water quality with commercially available alkali commonly used in the treatment of acid mine drainage water the fundamental hypothesis was that waste alkaline materials may provide both performance and economic benefits in relation to amd treatment the research questions addressed were 1 can the waste alkali materials raise the ph to the required levels to meet water discharge limits 2 is it possible to reduce dissolved metal concentrations to satisfy regulations and 3 what is scientific explanation for differences in performance for the various alkali s the australian and new zealand environment conservation council anzecc guidelines were used to determine the required discharge water quality values for this study 43 bench scale tests were conducted using acid mine drainage water collected from the open pit at the abandoned mount morgan mine in queensland australia lime neutralisation is currently being used at mount morgan to control the volume of amd in the open pit to avoid overflow events 44 this process involves the neutralisation of the mine pit water using slaked lime to increase the ph to between 6 5 and 8 5 to facilitate the precipitation of metals as metal hydroxides after approximately 2 h of residence time in the neutralisation tanks the slurry is dosed with a flocculating agent prior to clarification and disposal the treated water is ultimately discharged into the adjoining dee river if water quality requirements are met 2 materials and methods 2 1 water quality standards the anzecc guidelines for fresh and marine water which were used to determine the effectiveness of the alkali addition strategies in this study are outlined in table 1 43 in addition sulphate ion discharge limit was assumed to be 1000 mg l which is the upper limit for most environments and jurisdictions 2 2 amd solutions and chemicals acid mine drainage water samples were collected from the open cut pit at the mount morgan mine located in central queensland august 2014 note at the time of this investigation amd water used in the water treatment plant lime neutralisation was piped from approximately 3 m below the surface the compositions of surface water and water from 3 m depth were compared and it was confirmed that minimal variations in concentrations of metals were present lime sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate used in this research were of ar grade and supplied by labtek bayer liquor and bayer precipitates were synthesised in the laboratory as outlined below 2 3 synthesis of bayer liquor 10 g l bayer liquor solution was prepared by the dilution of a highly concentrated bayer liquor saturated evaporative liquor 96 g l al2o3 provided by an australian alumina refinery this latter solution was prepared by addition of 1 l of deionised di water to a 2 l volumetric flask to which 21 13 g of sodium carbonate na2co3 was dissolved before the addition of 29 99 g of sodium hydroxide naoh once the na2co3 and naoh were dissolved 212 ml of saturated evaporative liquor was added to the volumetric flask and additional di water added until the final solution volume was 2 l the mixture was then inverted several times to ensure homogeneity 2 4 synthesis of bayer precipitates bayer precipitate was synthesised by the addition of seawater to 1l of the 10 g l bayer liquor until a ph of 9 25 was obtained this latter ph value was achieved by placing the bayer liquor into a 10 l container equipped with an overhead stirrer ika rw20 with a 4 propeller paddle stirrer placed into solution the stirrer was set to 400 rpm to ensure uniform mixing while seawater was pumped into the beaker using a watson and marlow 520u pump set to 1 5 ml min using marprene tubing diameter 6 4 mm once a ph of 9 25 was obtained the solution was allowed to stir for a further 24 h before being vacuum filtered the precipitate was then placed in an oven 90 c overnight before being crushed to a fine powder 125 μm using a fritsch agate ball mill 2 5 acid mine drainage neutralisation the treatment of mine pit water involved the addition of known amounts of lime bayer hydrotalcite bayer liquor sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide to 25 ml of acid mine drainage water at ambient temperature the resultant mixture was then allowed to agitate for 24 h before being centrifuged using a thermofischer scientific x1 series centrifuge for 5 min at 2500 rpm we note that the selected time of 24 h may not be the optimum time in terms of practical application of this technology but for this bench study this approach was sufficient to determine the chemistry occurring the neutralisation process most probably was rapid and amenable to potential commercial application the supernatant was then transferred into a sample container while the solid component was washed with 30 ml of di water before being centrifuged again the solid component was placed in an oven overnight at 90 c to dry and then crushed to a fine powder using an agate mortar and pestle the ph and conductivity of treated amd were monitored using calibrated tps meters and probes solutions for icp oes were syringe filtered using a 0 45 μm nylon filter prior to analysis 2 6 leaching of precipitates precipitates obtained after the treatment of mine pit water with different alkalis were leached using di water and water from mount morgan s open pit measured amounts of the obtained precipitates were added to either 20 ml of di water or mine pit water and then stirred for 24 h before being centrifuged using a thermo fischer scientific x1 series centrifuge for 5 min at 2500 rpm the supernatant was then transferred into a sample container while the solid component was placed in an oven at 90 c overnight to dry the ph and conductivity of treated amd were monitored using calibrated tps meter and probes solutions for icp oes were syringe filtered using a 0 45 μm nylon filter prior to analysis 2 7 characterisation techniques 2 7 1 inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes solutions were analysed using a vista mpx ccd simultaneous icp oes instrument using an integration time of 0 15 s with 3 replications

curve using a hamilton auto diluter 2 7 2 x ray diffraction xrd x ray diffraction patterns were collected using a panalytical x pert wide angle x ray diffractometer operating in step scan mode with co kα radiation 1 7903 å patterns were collected in the range 5 90 2θ with a step size of 0 02 and a rate of 30 s per step samples were prepared as vaseline thin films on silica wafers which were then placed onto aluminium sample holders the xrd patterns were matched with icsd reference patterns using the software package highscore plus the profile fitting option of the software used a model that employed twelve intrinsic parameters to describe the profile the instrumental aberration and wavelength dependent contributions to the profile 2 7 3 optical imaging of precipitates light microscopy images were captured using a leica m125 light microscope fitted with a leica dfc490 digital camera flocculation samples were inverted slowly 5 times and allowed to flocculate for one minute where 30 μl of suspension was transferred between two glass slides the slides were viewed at 32 magnification subsequent images were analysed using the software package imagej images were made binary black and white and average particle size and area coverage of the flocculated particles was measured 2 7 4 freeze drying of mount morgan lime neutralisation sludge approximately 600 g of sludge was collected as a slurry from the mount morgan mine lime neutralisation plant and this material was freeze dried in a 80 freezer and then placed into the main chamber of the freeze dryer unit until dry the freeze dryer unit was operated at 0 013 mbar pressure with a condenser temperature of 55 c average moisture loss for the sludge samples was approximately 72 with a slight variation noted between sub samples the sludge sample was freeze dried as the high amounts of gypsum present would convert to bassanite caso4 0 5h2o if the samples were oven baked 2 7 5 x ray fluorescence samples for wavelength dispersive x ray fluorescence wdxrf major element analysis were prepared by weighing 1 15 g of the sample into a 95 5 pt au crucible followed by 8 85 g of vitreous 50 50 lithium tetraborate lithium metaborate flux containing 0 5 lithium iodide as a non wetting agent claisse scientific this sample was then mixed carefully in the crucible before being placed into an automatic six position fusion instrument theox claisse scientific the samples were fused for 20 min at 1050 c with constant agitation before the melts were poured automatically into 40 mm pt au casting dishes and then cooled by a stream of air the resultant glass disks were then analysed using a panalytical axios wdxrf equipped with a 1 kw rh tube calibrated for the analysis of 21 major elements using the panalytical wroxi protocol and associated standards loi was determined by igniting a separate sample portion in a muffle furnace at 1050 c for 30 min 2 7 6 acid digestion accurately weighed samples of the precipitates obtained after treatment of amd with different alkali were acid digested using 2 ml hcl 1 ml hno3 and 2 ml di water the sample mixture was then heated at 80 c for one hour the samples were then cooled prior to di water being added to the sample solutions to make final volume 50 ml digested samples were then diluted to 1 10 and 1 100 before being analysed by icp oes using above discussed method section 2 7 1 2 8 process simulation using aqmb software the commercially available aqmb water treatment software was used to simulate the current lime neutralisation plant conditions used at mount morgan to provide insights into the theoretical mineralogical phases that make up the lime sludge the simulation used a doser to add lime or sodium hydroxide caustic to the mine pit water table 2 using sulphate corrections for mass balance up to ph 7 5 a thickener was then used for the solid liquid separation process with design specifications as follows minimum underflow solids 5 w v feed pump duty pressure of 100 kpa 120 min contact zone 9000 mm mixer impeller diameter and 1 rpm rake arm rotation speed 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterisation of bayer precipitate the xrd pattern of bayer precipitate employed in this study fig 1 revealed that the material was composed of a number of mineralogical phases including 1 hydrotalcite mg6al2 oh 16 co3 4h2o 2 calcite caco3 rhombohedral 3 aragonite caco3 orthorhombic and 4 magnesium hydroxide mg oh 2 these detected materials were consistent with phases previously observed in precipitates formed from the seawater neutralisation of bayer liquor 35 45 46 however it was noted that brucite mg oh 2 is normally only observed when magnesium is more prevalent than aluminium at ph values greater than 10 11 47 the broadness of the d003 and d006 peaks approximately 12 and 25 2θ was characteristic of hydrotalcite and indicated that this material had a poorly crystalline structure probably due to hydroxide layers being partially askew 48 the bayer hydrotalcite formed had a d spacing of 7 8 å typical of a carbonate hydrotalcite material 49 based on the mineralogical composition of bayer precipitate species involved in the neutralisation of amd would be majorly hydrotalcite and calcium carbonate 3 2 amd characteristics the mine pit water contained relatively high concentrations of dissolved metals and displayed a characteristic low ph value of 3 74 table 2 typical of amd waters compared to the values observed by bosman 23 mount morgan mine pit water had a high sulphate concentration 17 430 mg l low iron concentration 16 7 mg l and significantly higher concentrations of aluminium 1233 mg l and magnesium 2265 mg l based on the geological study performed by taube 50 the primary sources of aluminium and magnesium were probably from feldspar and dolomite a previous study of mount morgan mine pit water in 2002 also showed major differences to the water composition in this study an increase in ph 2 7 3 74 so4 13600 17430 mg l al 780 1233 mg l mg 1280 2265 mg l cu 44 54 77 26 mg l mn 71 28 161 5 mg l and zn 21 97 48 89 mg l and reductions in fe 253 16 7 mg l and na 830 648 mg l the reduction in iron concentration from 2002 to 2014 was believed to be due to the precipitation of fe oh 3 which occurs at ph values above 3 5 in oxygenated waters caused by turbulence 51 a sediment sample taken from the open pit also showed the presence of jarosite kfe3 3 oh 6 so4 2 the rise in metal concentrations cu mn and zn in open pit water was probably a by product of the lime dosing plant built in 2006 to reduce water volumes in the open pit 52 the lime neutralising plant treats the mine pit water by raising the ph to 7 5 causing the precipitation of heavy metals before discharging the metal free water into the dee river the heavy metal rich sludge is transferred to an adjacent tailings beach 53 it is therefore proposed the decreasing water volumes and leaching of metals from the metal rich sludge has caused an increase in metals in the mine pit water over time the possibility for release of metals from the sludge when exposed to the open pit amd water has been confirmed in this study section 3 5 3 3 amd neutralisation using various alkalis treatment efficiency of amd by different alkaline materials depends upon various factors such as concentration and oxidation state of metals ph of amd water and hydrolysis reactions that occur upon addition of alkali to amd 54 fig 2 shows the ph behaviour as a function of the different alkali species during treatment of mine pit water neutralisation was assumed to be predominately through the buffering capacity of hydroxyl and carbonate groups in alkali 11 it was evident that increasing the ph of amd water consumed a substantial amount of alkalinity agent for example to achieve a ph between 6 and 7 for 25 ml of amd water 1 6 mmol lime 4 7 mmol sodium hydroxide 1 7 mmol of sodium carbonate 2 5 ml of 10 g l bayer liquor and 0 5025 g of bayer precipitate were required the dissolution of alkali increased the ph and promoted the formation of insoluble metal hydroxide and carbonate precipitates that could potentially be removed by a solid liquid separation process 55 table 3 provides a snapshot of the concentrations of al mg mn cu zn si fe and ni at 3 stages during treatment as a function of solution ph metal concentrations at approximately ph 3 5 6 5 and 9 the full range of ph values tested fig 2 corresponding amd water compositions and curves related to the removal of metals for each alkali at a particular ph is shown in fig 3 in order to evaluate the effectiveness of various alkalis for treatment in removing metals from amd the metal ion removal results table 3 were compared with australian and new zealand guidelines table 2 43 increasing the ph of mine pit water showed the precipitation of metal hydroxide and carbonate precipitates occurred in the following order fe al cu zn ni and then mn it was possible that iron and manganese could be selectively precipitated out of solution however for the remaining metals overlap in the precipitation ph range existed 3 3 1 iron removal iron species in acid mine drainage waters are normally in the ferric fe3 state due to oxygenation by turbulence however deeper water that has not been disturbed can have iron in the ferrous fe2 state 51 the water collected in this study was from a depth of only 3 m with the deepest section of the open pit being 40 m therefore it is reasonable to assume that the majority of the 16 7 mg l iron existed as fe3 as the ph of the mine pit water was gradually increased to in excess of 6 iron precipitated to the point it was below detection limits the removal of iron was relatively rapid with a sharp decline in iron concentration in the ph range 3 and 4 observed for all alkalis investigated fig 3 for all alkali tested 99 7 of iron was removed from the open pit amd waters thus meeting water quality

the fe concentration is more than four times the concentration of mn in water 22 however fe concentration in the mine pit water was too low 16 7 mg l and thus there was not enough iron present to promote the co precipitation of mn ni as and mo table 3 3 3 2 aluminium removal aluminium was the second metal found to precipitate out of solution within a ph range 4 7 fig 3 the average initial concentration of aluminium in the mine pit water was 1212 mg l treatment results for all alkali materials showed maximum removal of aluminium between ph 7 and 8 with a slight increase in aluminium concentration at ph values above 8 5 at ph 5 5 al begins to precipitate as al oh 3 eq 7 however this species can redissolve when the ph is increased to 8 5 as aluminate ions al oh 4 as shown in eq 8

showing a significantly greater retention of aluminium in the solid phase at ph values above 9 this is proposed to be due to the formation of calcium aluminium hydroxide co precipitates based on the work by packter and khaw 57 who showed precipitation of this latter mineral with increasing calcium concentrations in mixed cation solutions eq 9 9 2 c a a q 2 2 o h a q 2 a l o h 4 a q n h 2 o l c a

concentration of copper in the mine pit water was 79 32 mg l which was substantially above the anzecc water quality guidelines for copper 5 mg l 43 however the results in table 3 showed that by increasing the ph above 4 fig 3 greater than 95 removal of copper for all alkali materials was achieved which resulted in concentrations less than those stipulated by anzecc guidelines table 1 in the case of lime bayer liquor and bayer precipitates the concentration of copper fell below instrumental detection limits of 0 05 mg l table 3 baltpurvins et al 59 conducted a study on the solubility domains of copper hydroxide precipitate using lime and found that multiple phases formed depending on the cu2 so4 2 oh ratio temperature and reaction time the precipitation of copper hydroxides from sulphate rich solutions typically results in the formation of brochantite cu4so4 oh 6 as shown in eq 10 and tenorite cuo eq 11 as other phases such as posnjakite cu4so4 oh 6 h2o and spertiniite cu oh 2 are precursors to these more thermodynamically preferred minerals respectively 60 baltpurvins et al 59 further found that gypsum caso4 2h2o most dominant species precipitated during lime

removal the average initial concentration of zinc in the mine pit water was 48 62 mg l which was in excess of anzecc guidelines table 1 for discharge 43 in aerobic natural waters zinc can form various complexes with numerous ions carbonate and hydroxyls present in water 61 below ph 7 zinc exists as zn2 and in the ph range 7 8 2 ionic zinc gets converted to a hydroxycarbonate precipitate termed hydrozincite zn5 co3 2 oh 6 eq 12 in sulphate rich environments zinc forms znso4 eq 13 at ph 7 18 therefore the 95 removal of zinc in this study is proposed to be due to the formation of znso4 which was converted to hydrozincite at higher ph the treatment of mine pit water with lime sodium carbonate bayer liquor and bayer precipitates reduced the concentration of zinc below the instrumental detection limit of 0 05 mg l table 3 and anzecc guidelines table 1 43 12 z n a q 2 2 c o 3 a q 2 6 o h a q z n 5 c o 3 2 o h 6 s 13 z n a q 2 s o 4 a q 2 z n s o 4 s lime and bayer precipitate were discovered to be particularly effective at removing zinc from the mine pit water at a lower ph range ph 6 7 than the other alkaline materials ph 8 5 9 5 table 3 the calcium content in lime and bayer precipitates as caco3 resulted in an increase in the amount of gypsum that formed during the neutralisation of acid mine drainage water xrd in section 3 4 2 a study by huang et al 62 found that the formation of gypsum flocs from a sulphate wastewater and lime had a zinc uptake capacity of 0 06 mg g at ph 6 and 0 10 mg g at ph 7 therefore a similar adsorption and encapsulation process is proposed to be occurring in the neutralisation of amd water for lime and bayer precipitates 3 3 5 nickel removal the average initial concentration of nickel in the mine pit water was only 1 49 mg l which was considerably less than other metal species present nevertheless according to anzecc guidelines discharge requires concentration levels 0 2 mg l table 1 43 in aqueous systems ni is present as ionic nickel below ph 6 6 while between 6 6 and 8 2 ionic ni changes to species such as nico3 eq 14 or niso4 eq 15 depending upon the sulphate concentration in solution 18 treatment of mine pit water with all alkali materials showed the removal of ni to below instrumental detection limits 0 05 mg l at ph values around 8 in the case of lime sodium hydroxide and bayer precipitate acceptable discharge limits were achieved at ph values greater than 6 based on the work by olds et al 63 increased removal of nickel at lower ph values for lime sodium hydroxide and bayer precipitate may be due to the greater surface area of precipitates that form when using these alkali materials see section 3 4 3 for more details 14 n i a q 2 c o 3 a q 2 n i c o 3 s 15 n i a q 2 s o 4 a q 2 n i s o 4 s 3 3 6 manganese removal the removal of manganese from complex water matrices such as amd water using chemical precipitation can be problematic due to the highly alkaline conditions greater than 9 required to produce manganese precipitates 17 issues with raising the ph this high relate to concerns about excessive chemical usage failure to comply with discharge water ph requirements and the dissolution of aluminium hydroxide theoretically mn can exist in numerous oxidation states but in natural waters only mn2 and mn4 are relatively stable 64 depending upon ph conditions manganese can form oxides hydroxides or carbonate compounds 65 however between ph 9 and 9 5 mn is precipitated as hydroxides as shown in eq 16 17 with complete removal of mn requiring a ph of 10 5 66 16 m n a q 2 2 o h a q m n o h 2 s the average initial concentration of manganese in the mine pit water was 162 mg l which was above acceptable release limits sodium hydroxide decreased the concentration of mn to acceptable levels 0 2 mg l at ph 9 46 however slight increases in aluminium concentration were observed table 3 shows aluminium concentration increased to 3 46 mg l at ph 9 46 from 0 82 mg l at ph 8 10 bayer precipitates were able to remove 57 of manganese 67 2 mg l remaining in solution at ph 6 05 compared to 45 6 removal at ph 6 75 for lime next best performing alkali this result clearly showed that bayer precipitates perform better at the removal of manganese at lower ph values than the more conventionally used lime it is proposed that the incorporation of manganese in reformed hydrotalcite substitution of mg with mn in the structure enabled the removal of manganese at lower ph than the other alkalis a more in depth study outside the scope of the current work will be required to confirm this proposed mechanism in particular the reformation of hydrotalcite at ph 6 7 after dissolution in acid and the degree of mn inclusion in the structure 3 4 precipitate analysis 3 4 1 elemental composition the precipitates obtained after the treatment of mine pit water with different alkalis to a ph between 6 5 and 7 5 were analysed using icp oes to determine their elemental composition table 4 the bayer precipitate had the highest concentration of magnesium 105 13 mg g compared to the other alkaline materials wherein mg ranged from 16 68 to 34 70 mg g this was probably due to magnesium content present in bayer precipitates in the form of hydrotalcite mg6al2 oh 16 co3 4h2o in acidic conditions hydrotalcite in bayer precipitate dissociates 11 67 and thus releases hydroxyl units required for the neutralisation of acid mine drainage waters magnesium in the precipitates formed after neutralisation was most likely some form of magnesium hydroxide species or even could be due to the reformation of the hydrotalcite structure 68 all precipitates had very high concentrations of al fe cu zn si and mn as shown in table 4 the concentration of aluminium in lime 59 75 mg g and bayer precipitates 96 87 mg g was significantly lower than sodium hydroxide 122 57 mg g sodium carbonate 157 02 mg g and bayer liquor 133 94 mg g in the absence of excess ca gibbsite al oh 3 was the primary phase found for sodium hydroxide sodium carbonate and bayer liquor precipitates section 3 4 2 3 4 2 x ray diffraction the addition of lime to mine pit water resulted in gypsum caso4 2h2o reference 98 002 7221 being the primary phase formed fig 4 which agreed with the composition of the lime sludge sample collected at the mount morgan lime neutralisation tanks supplementary information gypsum was also a dominant phase formed with the addition of bayer precipitate to the amd water however calcite caco3 and hydrotalcite were also detected in the precipitates formed the presence of hydrotalcite in the precipitate showed that hydrotalcites can reform after they undergo dissolution in amd water these assignments were supported by the infrared spectra of the precipitates dominated by sulphate bands between 1200 and 900 cm 1 and 700 and 500 cm 1 supporting information as well as by high concentrations of mg ca and al found in the acid digested precipitates table 4 the remaining alkaline materials used to neutralise the mine pit water bayer liquor sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate produced precipitates with similar xrd patterns that primarily consisted of amorphous material and gypsum gypsum forms for mine pit water treated with sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide due to the presence of 460 mg l of calcium in the untreated mine pit water table 2 based on the location of the broad band in fig 4 with respect to the gibbsite reference pattern 98 041 3987 water chemistry and simulations performed using caustic additions using aqmb software table 5 it is proposed that the amorphous phase was primarily gibbsite al oh 3 aqmb simulations were also able to provide more details regarding the mineralogical phases which were difficult to characterise by xrd due to the presence of highly crystalline gypsum which exhibited intense reflections which obscured other peaks table 5 simulations were run for lime and sodium hydroxide with mount morgan mine pit water dosed to ph 7 5 and allowed to react for 2 h prior to solid liquid separation gypsum was the primary phase formed by the addition of lime at a rate of 2052 mol h followed by gibbsite 812 mol h and hydrotalcite 93 6 mol h this was an interesting finding as the xrd patterns of the lime precipitates were unable to identify the formation of gibbsite the addition of caustic in the simulation found gibbsite to be the primary phase formed at a rate of 812 mol h followed by hydrotalcite 194 mol hr and gypsum 77 26 mol h these results support the details in the xrd pattern shown in fig 4 based on the concentrations of sulphate in the feed 18630 mg l and resultant thickener overflow in aqmb the addition of lime results in a 42 reduction of sulphate in the discharge water 10780 mg l compared to a 1 6 reduction for caustic 18310 mg l interestingly different aluminosilicates were predicted by aqmb simulations to precipitate based on the alkaline material used in the case of lime muscovite formed kal3si3o10 oh 1 8 f0 2 while for caustic solutions paragonite formed naal3si3o10 oh 2 this latter situation was consistent with the dependency of the formation of paragonite and muscovite on the ratio of sodium na and potassium k 69 metal hydroxide phases could not be detected by xrd however heavy metals were present in the precipitates based on icp oes for the acid digested precipitate samples the aqmb simulations predicted that the main metal phases forming were copper hydroxide and carbonate zinc carbonate and birnessite table 5 in the presence of lime copper was precipitated out in relatively similar amounts of hydroxide 16 96 mol h and carbonate 12 66 mol h while the use of caustic in the neutralisation process favoured the formation of copper hydroxide 24 47 mol h both lime and caustic removed similar quantities of zinc 15 29 and 15 81 mol h respectively while lime precipitated out approximately double the amount of manganese than caustic at the same ph 1 00 compared to 0 49 mol h these simulation results appeared to reflect the trends observed in the actual treatment of the mount morgan mine pit water at ph 7 5 using lime and sodium hydroxide fig 3 it was thus apparent that the sludge composition was complex and this must be taken into account when determining how to handle reuse or store this material the analysis provided in this study provides a guide to future means of addressing this waste in the most practical manner the most effective alkali materials for the removal of metals were found to be lime and bayer precipitates high gypsum generating precipitates after the neutralisation of mine pit water huang et al 62 studied the removal of nickel copper and zinc from a sulphate wastewater using gypsum and determined the removal mechanism to be a combination of adsorption on gypsum colloids followed by encapsulation during the subsequent precipitation processes an increase in metal removal was found when there was a high ca2 so4 ratio solution ph ionic strength and surface area 62 it was noted that the addition of gypsum had a negligible adsorption of heavy metals but rather it was the formation of high surface area gypsum flocs from metal rich sulphate wastewaters that allowed for their removal 62 therefore the increased removal efficiency of heavy metals for lime and bayer precipitates was postulated as due to gypsum being the major mineralogical phase formed 3 4 3 particle size analysis sorption of metals on aluminium iron hydroxide precipitates has been reported to be related to their surface area 70 while the uptake of ni cu and zn from sulphate wastewaters has been linked to the surface area of gypsum flocs 62 magnesium hydroxides have also been found to show metal uptake capacity through adsorption onto the surface of mg oh 2 particles 71 as the concentration of iron in the mine pit water was only 16 7 mg l while the magnesium aluminium and calcium concentrations were 2265 1233 and 534 mg l respectively it is proposed that metal uptake was through adsorption on different phases of magnesium and aluminium hydroxide more prevalent in bayer precipitates compared to lime and gypsum to a much greater extent for lime the dissolution of hydrotalcite in bayer precipitates increases the amount of aluminium and magnesium available to form mg oh 2 and al oh 3 precipitates as the ph becomes alkaline 11 67 optical images and image j values for the average size μm of the precipitates that formed during the neutralisation of mine pit water with lime sodium hydroxide sodium carbonate bayer liquor and bayer precipitates are shown in fig 5 average particle size of the precipitates formed was in the order lime 730 μm bayer precipitates 184 μm sodium carbonate 62 μm sodium hydroxide 59 μm bayer liquor 20 μm based on the size of the flocs that formed for the different alkali it appeared that surface area alone was not driving the metal uptake capacity therefore based on the work by huang et al 62 it was believed that the encapsulation of metals in larger flocs precipitates was a key factor in metal removal 3 5 performance versus operational considerations the hydrochemical and geochemical behaviour of metals in solids must be considered during the treatment of mine pit water to avoid the release of metal contaminants once disposed of 19 72 depending upon the site conditions in some cases sludges are further treated for metal recovery or can be converted into an inert material via stabilisation or solidification prior to disposal to avoid further contamination 72 73 currently at mount morgan lime neutralised precipitates sludge are disposed of on a tailings beach that has periods of immersion with open pit water this form of disposal was chosen to utilise any residual caustic remaining in the sludge to slowly raise the ph of the water in the open pit however xrf analysis of samples collected at the mount morgan tailings beach table 6 shows that the metals have been leached back into the mine pit water reductions in cu 92 mn 87 and zn 96 and thus are being recirculated through the neutralisation tanks only slight reductions in calcium were observed 22 2 compared to 20 9 precipitates obtained after the treatment of mine pit water with different alkalis were leached using deionised water and mine pit water to determine the extent of metal leaching and thus precipitate stability concentration of metals mg l in di water and mine pit water after 24 h contact are provided in tables 7 and 8 respectively in di water the bayer precipitates appeared to be the most stable with leached al cu zn and fe concentrations being less than 0 05 mg l detection limit while only 1 30 mg l of mn leached minimal changes in ph were also observed remained neutral at around 7 25 bayer liquor and sodium hydroxide also showed minimal leached al cu zn and fe however at ph values of 6 04 and 5 67 respectively an increased amount of mn was leached 18 3 and 25 3 mg l compared to the bayer precipitates 1 30 mg l interestingly the mn concentration for lime which had the lowest ph value of 5 46 only observed 7 99 mg l the main mineralogical difference between bayer precipitates and lime with the other alkaline materials was the content of gypsum therefore the increased stability of mn in these precipitates was thought to be related to adsorption mechanisms previously explained 62 overall lime and sodium carbonate released the greatest amount of cu 2 10 and 2 19 mg l and zn 3 83 and 2 29 mg l back into solution the exposure of the precipitates to mine pit water for 24 h showed greater amounts of leached species precipitates obtained after mine pit water treatment with bayer precipitates had the greatest ph buffering capacity 5 73 after 24 h due to the formation of hydrotalcite and calcite as shown in fig 4 compared to all other alkaline materials whose ph was similar to the original 3 75 of the mine pit water between 3 80 and 3 90 this ph buffering capacity of bayer precipitates meant that bayer precipitates were able to reduce the concentrations of cu from 77 3 to 16 2 mg l zn from 48 9 to 34 7 mg l and al from 1233 to 42 9 mg l from mine pit water compared to other alkaline materials which showed an increase in the metal concentrations due to leaching table 8 however for all the tested alkaline materials including bayer precipitates this was not the case for mn when leaching the precipitates with mine pit water table 8 showed leaching for all tested alkaline materials due to low ph which resulted in enhanced mn concentrations ranging from 158 to 194 mg l in acidic conditions hydrotalcite present in bayer precipitates dissociates hence why bayer precipitates showed the highest concentration of leached mg resulted in increase in concentration to 3332 from 2265 mg l compared to concentrations ranging from 2386 to 2616 mg l for other alkaline materials it should be noted that the concentrations of mg cu mn and zn were significantly higher than the original mine pit water which supported the theory that the increased concentrations observed in this study compared to edraki et al 16 were due to the dissolution of precipitates in the disposed lime sludge overall bayer precipitates were the most stable in the presence of amd water this study has found bayer precipitates to perform as well as lime with the added benefits of increased sludge stability and the removal of manganese at lower ph however the mass required for attaining the desired ph is higher for bayer precipitates 40 g l to attain ph 7 5 compared to lime 6 16 g l to attain ph 7 7 and thus associated plant neutralising capacities would be negatively affected an added incentive for using bayer precipitates is that they are a waste by product of the alumina industry prepared from seawater neutralised residual bayer liquor bayer precipitates are also highly soluble in acidic conditions whereas the hydrophobic properties of lime means extensive mixing is required 19 22 by taking into account the cost and behaviour of lime it is suggested that using bayer precipitates for amd neutralisation and removal of metals is an attractive alternative both in terms of effectiveness and that one industry waste can be used to treat another s waste consideration into transportation costs and its feasibility requires further investigation 4 conclusions this study evaluated the hypothesis that waste bayer liquor and bayer precipitates from the alumina refining industry for the neutralisation of acid mine drainage the first question was whether the waste alkali materials could enhance the ph to achieve water discharge limits all investigated alkaline materials successfully raised the ph of treated mine pit water to meet discharge limits i e ph 6 5 8 5 the second research question was in relation to the effectiveness of removal of dissolved metal concentrations to satisfy regulations this study found that lime and bayer precipitates were more effective in removing the metals present in mount morgan mine pit water than either sodium hydroxide sodium carbonate or bayer liquor the removal capacity of bayer precipitates and lime was approximately the same for al cu fe zn and ni and shown to achieve acceptable discharge limits whereas in the case of mn at lower ph 6 5 7 5 bayer precipitates were more efficient than lime to decrease its concentration for complete mn removal ph 9 was required however raising the ph 9 was not viewed as acceptable since not only was the caustic nature of the water elevated but also aluminium content increased due to dissolution events therefore satisfying discharge limits for mn remains challenging the final research question concerned the search for a scientific explanation to explain differences in performance for the various alkali s the ability of the precipitates to encapsulate heavy metals was determined to be more important than surface area sludge produced after treatment with bayer precipitates was more stable and showed minimum metal leaching as compared to sludge produced after treatment with other alkali the mass of material required for attaining the desired ph was higher for bayer precipitates compared to lime but the capital cost for a system using lime was considered high due to its hydrophobic nature and the resultant extensive mixing required by considering the cost and behaviour of lime it was suggested that the use of tailings for the treatment of another mining waste was an interesting

14577,this study reports the novel use of alkaline waste material from the alumina refining industry bayer liquor and precipitates formed by the seawater neutralisation of bayer liquor for the neutralisation of acid mine drainage amd water the hypothesis was that utilization of waste to treat waste can potentially result in environmental and economic benefits the performance of bayer liquor and bayer precipitate was compared with conventional alkalis used for amd neutralisation such as lime ca oh 2 sodium hydroxide naoh and sodium carbonate na2co3 target ions to remove from the amd solution included al 1233 mg l cu 77 26 mg l fe 16 7 mg l ni 1 54 mg l mn 161 5 mg l and zn 48 89 mg l both alumina industry wastes were shown to produce treated water with acceptable discharge limits for all metals except mn nevertheless bayer precipitate was shown to have an enhanced ability to remove manganese at lower ph 6 5 7 5 relative to lime with residual mn concentrations of 32 30 and 85 40 mg l respectively manganese discharge limits were challenging to meet due to ph values 9 being required wherein not only aluminium species redissolved but also the ph was not compatible with discharge regulations mechanistically larger precipitates were found to positively influence the removal of heavy metals with lime and bayer precipitates forming the largest precipitates overall bayer precipitate was found to be a potential alternative for the treatment of amd water keywords acid mine drainage bauxite residue neutralisation bayer liquor bayer sprecipitates 1 introduction acid mine drainage amd is a challenging environmental problem created by numerous mining operations 1 2 in the presence of oxygen water and oxidising bacteria the oxidation of pyrite and other sulphide minerals in mine wastes occur which leads to the formation of acid mine drainage 1 3 the pyrite oxidation is a complex process resulting in release of hydrogen sulphate and ferrous ions eq 1 4 in oxygenated water ferrous iron fe2 is oxidised to ferric iron fe3 eq 2 which either further reacts with pyrite to produce more ferrous iron and acidity eq 3 or precipitates as ochre fe oh 3 eq 4 4 in waste rocks a variety of other metal sulphides can also be oxidised in the presence of oxygen and water eq 5 and may release metals such as arsenic cadmium zinc copper and lead which can ultimately contaminate groundwater making it unsuitable for drinking and agricultural purposes 5 nearby waterways can also be affected if run off events occur and situations exist wherein significant fish and crustacean kills have been observed due to low ph conditions 6 7 the toxic characteristics of amd can permanently damage surrounding ecosystems thus suitable management and treatment methods to remediate affected water bodies are required 5 1 2 f e s 2 s 2 h 2 o l 7 o 2 g 2 f e 2 a q 4 s o 4 2 a q 4 h a q 2 2 f e 2 a q 2 h a q 1 2 o 2 g 2 f e 3 a q h 2 o l 3 15 f e 2 a q 16 h a q 2 s o 4 2 a q 2 f e 3

passive systems based on their requirements for chemical addition infrastructure maintenance and monitoring a variety of passive treatment systems such as aerobic wetlands anaerobic or compost wetlands 8 vertical flow wetlands amd treatment ponds bioreactors and permeable reactive barriers 5 9 10 are available to treat acid mine drainage however the requirement of relatively large land area high installation cost and system failure poor design winter conditions or due to accumulation of metal hydroxides are the major disadvantages associated with these treatment systems active treatment methods of acid mine drainage water typically involve alkali addition in order to raise the ph to between 6 and 9 11 13 in this latter ph range the concentrations of dissolved metals generally decreases due to the formation of insoluble metal hydroxides and oxyhydroxides 14 15 the rate and degree of metal precipitation depends upon their concentration identity and complex interaction between dissolved species in water 16 for example in an oxygen rich environment the recommended ph for iron fe3 precipitation is 3 5 4 0 while in oxygen poor environments a ph of 8 5 is required 14 manganese mn precipitation is dependent upon the oxidation state present but will generally precipitate at ph 9 a value which is typically higher than recommended water discharge limits 14 if the iron concentration in water is significantly higher than manganese it may be removed with iron at ph 8 due to co precipitation 14 aluminium al generally precipitates at ph 5 but this element enters back into solution at ph 9 0 as soluble aluminate ions al oh 4 17 therefore increasing the ph to 9 to remove mn can result in the dissolution of aluminium precipitates divalent metal ions such as nickel ni2 and zinc zn2 precipitate at ph values ranging from 8 to 9 18 various alkalis like lime ca oh 2 sodium hydroxide naoh and sodium carbonate na2co3 have been used to modify ph and remove heavy metals from amd water as precipitates 19 20 in some cases limestone caco3 was employed and removed 90 of heavy metals such as cd pb zn ni cu and cr iii from solutions at ph 8 5 21 lime is arguably the most widely used alkali applied to remediate acid mine drainage solutions 22 due mainly to its relatively low cost availability and simplicity of treatment plant 23 a disadvantage of the process is the voluminous sludge that is produced sludge typically settles slowly to 10 of the volume of water treated albeit as much as 50 sludge volume has been observed 23 the combination of slow settling rate low sludge density and excessive volumes of sludge formed from the neutralisation process can result in a costly process bosman 23 reviewed the variability of mine water and resultant sludge compositions and the benefits of using high density sludge recovery methods to improve sludge characteristics an analysis of amd water compositions from six different south african mines showed large variations in ph 1 8 5 0 calcium 30 800 mg l magnesium 10 660 mg l ferrous iron 5 1250 mg l ferric iron 5 3350 mg l aluminium 2 200 mg l and sulphate 600 13390 mg l concentrations of heavy metals were not provided 23 this variability in amd water quality illustrates the difficulties in developing a single treatment process for all amd waters the problem is further escalated when variations in mine water compositions at the same mine site are considered as reported by edraki et al 16 for ten water holding areas at mount morgan mine the following variations were observed across the ten sites at mount morgan ph 2 6 3 8 sulphate 8390 56240 mg l aluminium 209 3074 mg l calcium 426 514 mg l magnesium 1051 6101 mg l iron 13 1487 mg l sodium 106 830 mg l copper 3 27 138 mg l manganese 51 1 355 mg l and zinc 7 11 81 4 mg l from the previous discussion it can be seen that amd solutions are inherently composed of many dissolved components 24 and thus the optimal alkali addition strategy may not be the same for all amd types additionally the question arises as to the potential benefits of employing alternate alkaline solutions or materials 19 25 26 an innovative means of treating amd solutions may involve the application of alkaline solutions or materials produced as waste products from other major industries for example bauxite refining produces large volumes of highly alkaline ph 13 waste 1 1 5 t of red mud slurry produced for every tonne of alumina produced 27 28 many researchers have reported the use of bauxite refinery residue solid portion of red mud to treat acid mine drainage neutralisation of the acid and precipitation or adsorption of heavy metals however large volumes of solid waste is produced that requires subsequent disposal and capping to prevent metals leaching 29 33 very little research has been completed on the use of red mud liquor and seawater derivatives bayer precipitate to treat acid mine drainage 34 as well as comparisons of the performance of bauxite refinery wastes with commercially used materials therefore this research will focus on comparing the use of bayer liquor and bayer precipitates to treat amd with conventionally used alkali seawater neutralisation of bayer liquor results in the formation of bayer precipitates comprising of hydrotalcite mg6al2 oh 16 co3 4h2o and calcium carbonate species caco3 35 36 due to the causticity of these waste materials they may prove an interesting alternative to the traditional application of lime for treating amd waters 11 34 it is envisioned that the use of these cleaner wastes from bauxite residues will produce similar volumes of waste to traditional neutralisation agents such as lime with similar or improved metal removal capacities due to the presence of hydrotalcite in the bayer precipitate a known adsorbent material 37 the fact that a region such as queensland contains not only a substantial bauxite refining industry 38 39 but also numerous acid mine drainage problems generated by the mining industry 40 42 makes this outlined approach attractive therefore the aim of this study was to compare the performance of bayer liquor and bayer precipitates with respect to material requirements and discharge water quality with commercially available alkali commonly used in the treatment of acid mine drainage water the fundamental hypothesis was that waste alkaline materials may provide both performance and economic benefits in relation to amd treatment the research questions addressed were 1 can the waste alkali materials raise the ph to the required levels to meet water discharge limits 2 is it possible to reduce dissolved metal concentrations to satisfy regulations and 3 what is scientific explanation for differences in performance for the various alkali s the australian and new zealand environment conservation council anzecc guidelines were used to determine the required discharge water quality values for this study 43 bench scale tests were conducted using acid mine drainage water collected from the open pit at the abandoned mount morgan mine in queensland australia lime neutralisation is currently being used at mount morgan to control the volume of amd in the open pit to avoid overflow events 44 this process involves the neutralisation of the mine pit water using slaked lime to increase the ph to between 6 5 and 8 5 to facilitate the precipitation of metals as metal hydroxides after approximately 2 h of residence time in the neutralisation tanks the slurry is dosed with a flocculating agent prior to clarification and disposal the treated water is ultimately discharged into the adjoining dee river if water quality requirements are met 2 materials and methods 2 1 water quality standards the anzecc guidelines for fresh and marine water which were used to determine the effectiveness of the alkali addition strategies in this study are outlined in table 1 43 in addition sulphate ion discharge limit was assumed to be 1000 mg l which is the upper limit for most environments and jurisdictions 2 2 amd solutions and chemicals acid mine drainage water samples were collected from the open cut pit at the mount morgan mine located in central queensland august 2014 note at the time of this investigation amd water used in the water treatment plant lime neutralisation was piped from approximately 3 m below the surface the compositions of surface water and water from 3 m depth were compared and it was confirmed that minimal variations in concentrations of metals were present lime sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate used in this research were of ar grade and supplied by labtek bayer liquor and bayer precipitates were synthesised in the laboratory as outlined below 2 3 synthesis of bayer liquor 10 g l bayer liquor solution was prepared by the dilution of a highly concentrated bayer liquor saturated evaporative liquor 96 g l al2o3 provided by an australian alumina refinery this latter solution was prepared by addition of 1 l of deionised di water to a 2 l volumetric flask to which 21 13 g of sodium carbonate na2co3 was dissolved before the addition of 29 99 g of sodium hydroxide naoh once the na2co3 and naoh were dissolved 212 ml of saturated evaporative liquor was added to the volumetric flask and additional di water added until the final solution volume was 2 l the mixture was then inverted several times to ensure homogeneity 2 4 synthesis of bayer precipitates bayer precipitate was synthesised by the addition of seawater to 1l of the 10 g l bayer liquor until a ph of 9 25 was obtained this latter ph value was achieved by placing the bayer liquor into a 10 l container equipped with an overhead stirrer ika rw20 with a 4 propeller paddle stirrer placed into solution the stirrer was set to 400 rpm to ensure uniform mixing while seawater was pumped into the beaker using a watson and marlow 520u pump set to 1 5 ml min using marprene tubing diameter 6 4 mm once a ph of 9 25 was obtained the solution was allowed to stir for a further 24 h before being vacuum filtered the precipitate was then placed in an oven 90 c overnight before being crushed to a fine powder 125 μm using a fritsch agate ball mill 2 5 acid mine drainage neutralisation the treatment of mine pit water involved the addition of known amounts of lime bayer hydrotalcite bayer liquor sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide to 25 ml of acid mine drainage water at ambient temperature the resultant mixture was then allowed to agitate for 24 h before being centrifuged using a thermofischer scientific x1 series centrifuge for 5 min at 2500 rpm we note that the selected time of 24 h may not be the optimum time in terms of practical application of this technology but for this bench study this approach was sufficient to determine the chemistry occurring the neutralisation process most probably was rapid and amenable to potential commercial application the supernatant was then transferred into a sample container while the solid component was washed with 30 ml of di water before being centrifuged again the solid component was placed in an oven overnight at 90 c to dry and then crushed to a fine powder using an agate mortar and pestle the ph and conductivity of treated amd were monitored using calibrated tps meters and probes solutions for icp oes were syringe filtered using a 0 45 μm nylon filter prior to analysis 2 6 leaching of precipitates precipitates obtained after the treatment of mine pit water with different alkalis were leached using di water and water from mount morgan s open pit measured amounts of the obtained precipitates were added to either 20 ml of di water or mine pit water and then stirred for 24 h before being centrifuged using a thermo fischer scientific x1 series centrifuge for 5 min at 2500 rpm the supernatant was then transferred into a sample container while the solid component was placed in an oven at 90 c overnight to dry the ph and conductivity of treated amd were monitored using calibrated tps meter and probes solutions for icp oes were syringe filtered using a 0 45 μm nylon filter prior to analysis 2 7 characterisation techniques 2 7 1 inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes solutions were analysed using a vista mpx ccd simultaneous icp oes instrument using an integration time of 0 15 s with 3 replications

curve using a hamilton auto diluter 2 7 2 x ray diffraction xrd x ray diffraction patterns were collected using a panalytical x pert wide angle x ray diffractometer operating in step scan mode with co kα radiation 1 7903 å patterns were collected in the range 5 90 2θ with a step size of 0 02 and a rate of 30 s per step samples were prepared as vaseline thin films on silica wafers which were then placed onto aluminium sample holders the xrd patterns were matched with icsd reference patterns using the software package highscore plus the profile fitting option of the software used a model that employed twelve intrinsic parameters to describe the profile the instrumental aberration and wavelength dependent contributions to the profile 2 7 3 optical imaging of precipitates light microscopy images were captured using a leica m125 light microscope fitted with a leica dfc490 digital camera flocculation samples were inverted slowly 5 times and allowed to flocculate for one minute where 30 μl of suspension was transferred between two glass slides the slides were viewed at 32 magnification subsequent images were analysed using the software package imagej images were made binary black and white and average particle size and area coverage of the flocculated particles was measured 2 7 4 freeze drying of mount morgan lime neutralisation sludge approximately 600 g of sludge was collected as a slurry from the mount morgan mine lime neutralisation plant and this material was freeze dried in a 80 freezer and then placed into the main chamber of the freeze dryer unit until dry the freeze dryer unit was operated at 0 013 mbar pressure with a condenser temperature of 55 c average moisture loss for the sludge samples was approximately 72 with a slight variation noted between sub samples the sludge sample was freeze dried as the high amounts of gypsum present would convert to bassanite caso4 0 5h2o if the samples were oven baked 2 7 5 x ray fluorescence samples for wavelength dispersive x ray fluorescence wdxrf major element analysis were prepared by weighing 1 15 g of the sample into a 95 5 pt au crucible followed by 8 85 g of vitreous 50 50 lithium tetraborate lithium metaborate flux containing 0 5 lithium iodide as a non wetting agent claisse scientific this sample was then mixed carefully in the crucible before being placed into an automatic six position fusion instrument theox claisse scientific the samples were fused for 20 min at 1050 c with constant agitation before the melts were poured automatically into 40 mm pt au casting dishes and then cooled by a stream of air the resultant glass disks were then analysed using a panalytical axios wdxrf equipped with a 1 kw rh tube calibrated for the analysis of 21 major elements using the panalytical wroxi protocol and associated standards loi was determined by igniting a separate sample portion in a muffle furnace at 1050 c for 30 min 2 7 6 acid digestion accurately weighed samples of the precipitates obtained after treatment of amd with different alkali were acid digested using 2 ml hcl 1 ml hno3 and 2 ml di water the sample mixture was then heated at 80 c for one hour the samples were then cooled prior to di water being added to the sample solutions to make final volume 50 ml digested samples were then diluted to 1 10 and 1 100 before being analysed by icp oes using above discussed method section 2 7 1 2 8 process simulation using aqmb software the commercially available aqmb water treatment software was used to simulate the current lime neutralisation plant conditions used at mount morgan to provide insights into the theoretical mineralogical phases that make up the lime sludge the simulation used a doser to add lime or sodium hydroxide caustic to the mine pit water table 2

pump duty pressure of 100 kpa 120 min contact zone 9000 mm mixer impeller diameter and 1 rpm rake arm rotation speed 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterisation of bayer precipitate the xrd pattern of bayer precipitate employed in this study fig 1 revealed that the material was composed of a number of mineralogical phases including 1 hydrotalcite mg6al2 oh 16 co3 4h2o 2 calcite caco3 rhombohedral 3 aragonite caco3 orthorhombic and 4 magnesium hydroxide mg oh 2 these detected materials were consistent with phases previously observed in precipitates formed from the seawater neutralisation of bayer liquor 35 45 46 however it was noted that brucite mg oh 2 is normally only observed when magnesium is more prevalent than aluminium at ph values greater than 10 11 47 the broadness of the d003 and d006 peaks approximately 12 and 25 2θ was characteristic of hydrotalcite and indicated that this material had a poorly crystalline structure probably due to hydroxide layers being partially askew 48 the bayer hydrotalcite formed had a d spacing of 7 8 å typical of a carbonate hydrotalcite material 49 based on the mineralogical composition of bayer precipitate species involved in the neutralisation of amd would be majorly hydrotalcite and calcium carbonate 3 2 amd characteristics the mine pit water contained relatively high concentrations of dissolved metals and displayed a characteristic low ph value of 3 74 table 2 typical of amd waters compared to the values observed by bosman 23 mount morgan mine pit water had a high sulphate concentration 17 430 mg l low iron concentration 16 7 mg l and significantly higher concentrations of aluminium 1233 mg l and magnesium 2265 mg l based on the geological study performed by taube 50 the primary sources of aluminium and magnesium were probably from feldspar and dolomite a previous study of mount morgan mine pit water in 2002 also showed major differences to the water composition in this study an increase in ph 2

iron concentration from 2002 to 2014 was believed to be due to the precipitation of fe oh 3 which occurs at ph values above 3 5 in oxygenated waters caused by turbulence 51 a sediment sample taken from the open pit also showed the presence of jarosite kfe3 3 oh 6 so4 2 the rise in metal concentrations cu mn and zn in open pit water was probably a by product of the lime dosing plant built in 2006 to reduce water volumes in the open pit 52 the lime neutralising plant treats the mine pit water by raising the ph to 7 5 causing the precipitation of heavy metals before discharging the metal free water into the dee river the heavy metal rich sludge is transferred to an adjacent tailings beach 53 it is therefore proposed the decreasing water volumes and leaching of metals from the metal rich sludge has caused an increase in metals in the mine pit water over time the possibility for release of metals from the sludge when exposed to the open pit amd water has been confirmed in this study section 3 5 3 3 amd neutralisation using various alkalis treatment efficiency of amd by different alkaline materials depends upon various factors such as concentration and oxidation state of metals ph of amd water and hydrolysis reactions that occur upon addition of alkali to amd 54 fig 2 shows the ph behaviour as a function of the different alkali species during treatment of mine pit water neutralisation was assumed to be predominately through the buffering capacity of hydroxyl and carbonate groups in alkali 11 it was evident that increasing the ph of amd water consumed a substantial amount of alkalinity agent for example to achieve a ph between 6 and 7 for 25 ml of amd water 1 6 mmol lime 4 7 mmol sodium hydroxide 1 7 mmol of sodium carbonate 2 5 ml of 10 g l bayer liquor and 0 5025 g of bayer precipitate were required the dissolution of alkali increased the ph and promoted the formation of insoluble metal hydroxide and carbonate precipitates that could potentially be removed by a solid liquid separation process 55 table 3 provides a snapshot of the concentrations of al mg mn cu zn si fe and ni at 3 stages during treatment as a function of solution ph metal concentrations at approximately ph 3 5 6 5 and 9 the full range of ph values tested fig 2 corresponding amd water compositions and curves related to the removal of metals for each alkali at a particular ph is shown in fig 3 in order to evaluate the effectiveness of various alkalis for treatment in removing metals from amd the metal ion removal results table 3 were compared with australian and new zealand guidelines table 2 43 increasing the ph of mine pit water showed the precipitation of metal hydroxide and carbonate precipitates occurred in the following order fe al cu zn ni and then mn it was possible that iron and manganese could be selectively precipitated out of solution however for the remaining metals overlap in the precipitation ph range existed 3 3 1 iron removal iron species in acid mine drainage waters are normally in the ferric fe3 state due to oxygenation by turbulence however deeper water that has not been disturbed can have iron in the ferrous fe2 state 51 the water collected in this study was from a depth of only 3 m with the deepest section of the open pit being 40 m therefore it is reasonable to assume that the majority of the 16 7 mg l iron existed as fe3 as the ph of the mine pit water was gradually increased to in excess of 6 iron precipitated to the point it was below detection limits the removal of iron was relatively rapid with a sharp decline in iron concentration in the ph range 3 and 4 observed for all alkalis investigated fig 3 for all alkali tested 99 7 of iron was removed from the open pit amd waters thus meeting water quality

the fe concentration is more than four times the concentration of mn in water 22 however fe concentration in the mine pit water was too low 16 7 mg l and thus there was not enough iron present to promote the co precipitation of mn ni as and mo table 3 3 3 2 aluminium removal aluminium was the second metal found to precipitate out of solution within a ph range 4 7 fig 3 the average initial concentration of aluminium in the mine pit water was 1212 mg l treatment results for all alkali materials showed maximum removal of aluminium between ph 7 and 8 with a slight increase in aluminium

showing a significantly greater retention of aluminium in the solid phase at ph values above 9 this is proposed to be due to the formation of calcium aluminium hydroxide co precipitates based on the work by packter and khaw 57 who showed precipitation of this latter mineral with increasing calcium concentrations in mixed cation solutions eq 9 9 2 c a a q 2 2 o h a q 2 a l o h 4 a q n h 2 o l c a

concentration of copper in the mine pit water was 79 32 mg l which was substantially above the anzecc water quality guidelines for copper 5 mg l 43 however the results in table 3 showed that by increasing the ph above 4 fig 3 greater than 95 removal of copper for all alkali materials was achieved which resulted in concentrations less than those stipulated by anzecc guidelines table 1 in the case of lime bayer liquor and bayer precipitates the concentration of copper fell below instrumental detection limits of 0 05 mg l table 3 baltpurvins et al 59 conducted a study on the solubility domains of copper hydroxide precipitate using lime and found that multiple phases formed depending on the cu2 so4 2 oh ratio temperature and reaction time the precipitation of copper hydroxides from sulphate rich solutions typically results in the formation of brochantite cu4so4 oh 6 as shown in eq 10 and tenorite cuo eq 11 as other phases such as posnjakite cu4so4 oh 6 h2o and spertiniite cu oh 2 are precursors to these more thermodynamically preferred minerals respectively 60 baltpurvins et al 59 further found that gypsum caso4 2h2o most dominant species precipitated during lime

removal the average initial concentration of zinc in the mine pit water was 48 62 mg l which was in excess of anzecc guidelines table 1 for discharge 43 in aerobic natural waters zinc can form various complexes with numerous ions carbonate and hydroxyls present in water 61 below ph 7 zinc exists as zn2 and in the ph range 7 8 2 ionic zinc gets converted to a hydroxycarbonate precipitate termed hydrozincite zn5 co3 2 oh 6 eq 12 in sulphate rich environments zinc forms znso4 eq 13 at ph 7 18 therefore the 95 removal of zinc in this study is proposed to be due to the formation of znso4 which was converted to hydrozincite at higher ph the treatment of mine pit water with lime sodium carbonate bayer liquor and bayer precipitates reduced the concentration of zinc below the instrumental detection limit of 0 05 mg l table 3 and anzecc guidelines table 1 43 12 z n a q 2 2 c o 3 a q 2 6 o h a q z n 5 c o 3 2 o h 6 s 13 z n a q 2 s o 4 a q 2 z n s o 4 s lime and bayer precipitate were

precipitates as caco3 resulted in an increase in the amount of gypsum that formed during the neutralisation of acid mine drainage water xrd in section 3 4 2 a study by huang et al 62 found that the formation of gypsum flocs from a sulphate wastewater and lime had a zinc uptake capacity of 0 06 mg g at ph 6 and 0 10 mg g at ph 7 therefore a similar adsorption and encapsulation process is proposed to be occurring in the neutralisation of amd water for lime and bayer precipitates 3 3 5 nickel removal the average initial concentration of nickel in the mine pit water was only 1 49 mg l which was considerably less than other metal species present nevertheless according to anzecc guidelines discharge requires concentration levels 0 2 mg l table 1 43 in aqueous systems ni is present as ionic nickel below ph 6 6 while between 6 6 and 8 2 ionic ni changes to species such as nico3 eq 14 or niso4 eq 15 depending upon the sulphate concentration in solution 18 treatment of mine pit water with all alkali materials showed the removal of ni to below instrumental detection limits 0 05 mg l at ph values around 8 in the case of lime sodium hydroxide and bayer precipitate acceptable discharge limits were achieved at ph values greater than 6 based on the work by olds et al 63 increased removal of nickel at lower ph values for lime sodium hydroxide and bayer precipitate may be due to the greater surface area of precipitates that form when using these alkali materials see section 3 4 3 for more details 14 n i a q 2 c o 3 a q 2 n i c o 3 s 15 n i a q 2 s o 4 a q 2 n i s o 4 s 3 3 6 manganese removal the removal of manganese from complex water matrices such as amd water using chemical precipitation can be problematic due to the highly alkaline conditions greater than 9 required to produce manganese precipitates 17 issues with raising the ph this high relate to concerns about excessive chemical usage failure to comply with discharge water ph requirements and the dissolution of aluminium hydroxide theoretically mn can exist in numerous oxidation states but in natural waters only mn2 and mn4 are relatively stable 64 depending upon ph conditions manganese can form oxides hydroxides or carbonate compounds 65 however between ph 9 and 9 5 mn is precipitated as hydroxides as shown in eq 16 17 with complete removal of mn requiring a ph of 10 5 66 16 m n a q 2 2 o h a q m n o h 2 s the average initial concentration of manganese in the mine pit water was 162 mg l which was above acceptable release limits sodium hydroxide decreased the concentration of mn to acceptable levels 0 2 mg l at ph 9 46 however slight increases in aluminium concentration were observed table 3 shows aluminium concentration increased to 3 46 mg l at ph 9 46 from 0 82 mg l at ph 8 10 bayer precipitates were able to remove 57 of manganese 67 2 mg l remaining in solution at ph 6 05 compared to 45 6 removal at ph 6 75 for lime next best performing alkali this result clearly showed that bayer precipitates perform better at the removal of manganese at lower ph values than the more conventionally used lime it is proposed that the incorporation of manganese in reformed hydrotalcite substitution of mg with mn in the structure enabled the removal of manganese at lower ph than the other alkalis a more in depth study outside the scope of the current work will be required to confirm this proposed mechanism in particular the reformation of hydrotalcite at ph 6 7 after dissolution in acid and the degree of mn inclusion in the structure 3 4 precipitate analysis 3 4 1 elemental composition the precipitates obtained after the treatment of mine pit water with different alkalis to a ph between 6 5 and 7 5 were analysed using icp oes to determine their elemental composition table 4 the bayer precipitate had the highest concentration of magnesium 105 13 mg g compared to the other alkaline materials wherein mg ranged from 16 68 to 34 70 mg g this was probably due to magnesium content present in bayer precipitates in the form of hydrotalcite mg6al2 oh 16 co3 4h2o in acidic conditions hydrotalcite in bayer precipitate dissociates 11 67 and thus releases hydroxyl units required for the neutralisation of acid mine drainage waters magnesium in the precipitates formed after neutralisation was most likely some form of magnesium hydroxide species or even could be due to the reformation of the hydrotalcite structure 68 all precipitates had very high concentrations of al fe cu zn si and mn as shown in table 4 the concentration of aluminium in lime 59 75 mg g and bayer precipitates 96 87 mg g was significantly lower than sodium hydroxide 122 57 mg g sodium carbonate 157 02 mg g and bayer liquor 133 94 mg g in the absence of excess ca gibbsite al oh 3 was the primary phase found for sodium hydroxide sodium carbonate and bayer liquor precipitates section 3 4 2 3 4 2 x ray diffraction the addition of lime to mine pit water resulted in gypsum caso4 2h2o reference 98 002 7221 being the primary phase formed fig 4 which agreed with the composition of the lime sludge sample collected at the mount morgan lime neutralisation tanks supplementary information gypsum was also a dominant phase formed with the addition of bayer precipitate to the amd water however calcite caco3 and hydrotalcite were also detected in the precipitates formed the presence of hydrotalcite in the precipitate showed that hydrotalcites can reform after they undergo dissolution in amd water these assignments were supported by the infrared spectra of the precipitates dominated by sulphate bands between 1200 and 900 cm 1 and 700 and 500 cm 1 supporting information as well as by high concentrations of mg ca and al found in the acid digested precipitates table 4 the remaining alkaline materials used to neutralise the mine pit water bayer liquor sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate produced precipitates with similar xrd patterns that primarily consisted of amorphous material and gypsum gypsum forms for mine pit water treated with sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide due to the presence of 460 mg l of calcium in the untreated mine pit water table 2 based on the location of the broad band in fig 4 with respect to the gibbsite reference pattern 98 041 3987 water chemistry and simulations performed using caustic additions using aqmb software table 5 it is proposed that the amorphous phase was primarily gibbsite al oh 3 aqmb simulations were also able to provide more details regarding the mineralogical phases which were difficult to characterise by xrd due to the presence of highly crystalline gypsum which exhibited intense reflections which obscured other peaks table 5 simulations were run for lime and sodium hydroxide with mount morgan mine pit water dosed to ph 7 5 and allowed to react for 2 h prior to solid liquid separation gypsum was the primary phase formed by the addition of lime at a rate of 2052 mol h followed by gibbsite 812 mol h and hydrotalcite 93 6 mol h this was an interesting finding as the xrd patterns of the lime precipitates were unable to identify the formation of gibbsite the addition of caustic in the simulation found gibbsite to be the primary phase formed at a rate of 812 mol h followed by hydrotalcite 194 mol hr and gypsum 77 26 mol h these results support the details in the xrd pattern shown in fig 4 based on the concentrations of sulphate in the feed 18630 mg l and resultant thickener overflow in aqmb the addition of lime results in a 42 reduction of sulphate in the discharge water 10780 mg l compared to a 1 6 reduction for caustic 18310 mg l interestingly different aluminosilicates were predicted by aqmb simulations to precipitate based on the alkaline material used in the case of lime muscovite formed kal3si3o10 oh 1 8 f0 2 while for caustic solutions paragonite formed naal3si3o10 oh 2 this latter situation was consistent with the dependency of the formation of paragonite and muscovite on the ratio of sodium na and potassium k 69 metal hydroxide phases could not be detected by xrd however heavy metals were present in the precipitates based on icp oes for the acid digested precipitate samples the aqmb simulations predicted that the main metal phases forming were copper hydroxide and carbonate zinc carbonate and birnessite table 5 in the presence of lime copper was precipitated out in relatively similar amounts of hydroxide 16 96 mol h and carbonate 12 66 mol h while the use of caustic in the neutralisation process favoured the formation of copper hydroxide 24 47 mol h both lime and caustic removed similar quantities of zinc 15 29 and 15 81 mol h respectively while lime precipitated out approximately double the amount of manganese than caustic at the same ph 1 00 compared to 0 49 mol h these simulation results appeared to reflect the trends observed in the actual treatment of the mount morgan mine pit water at ph 7 5 using lime and sodium hydroxide fig 3 it was thus apparent that the sludge composition was complex and this must be taken into account when determining how to handle reuse or store this material the analysis provided in this study provides a guide to future means of addressing this waste in the most practical manner the most effective alkali materials for the removal of metals were found to be lime and bayer precipitates high gypsum generating precipitates after the neutralisation of mine pit water huang et al 62 studied the removal of nickel copper and zinc from a sulphate wastewater using gypsum and determined the removal mechanism to be a combination of adsorption on gypsum colloids followed by encapsulation during the subsequent precipitation processes an increase in metal removal was found when there was a high ca2 so4 ratio solution ph ionic strength and surface area 62 it was noted that the addition of gypsum had a negligible adsorption of heavy metals but rather it was the formation of high surface area gypsum flocs from metal rich sulphate wastewaters that allowed for their removal 62 therefore the increased removal efficiency of heavy metals for lime and bayer precipitates was postulated as due to gypsum being the major mineralogical phase formed 3 4 3 particle size analysis sorption of metals on aluminium iron hydroxide precipitates has been reported to be related to their surface area 70 while the uptake of ni cu and zn from sulphate wastewaters has been linked to the surface area of gypsum flocs 62 magnesium hydroxides have also been found to show metal uptake capacity through adsorption onto the surface of mg oh 2 particles 71 as the concentration of iron in the mine pit water was only 16 7 mg l while the magnesium aluminium and calcium concentrations were 2265 1233 and 534 mg l respectively it is proposed that metal uptake was through adsorption on different phases of magnesium and aluminium hydroxide more prevalent in bayer precipitates compared to lime and gypsum to a much greater extent for lime the dissolution of hydrotalcite in bayer precipitates increases the amount of aluminium and magnesium available to form mg oh 2 and al oh 3 precipitates as the ph becomes alkaline 11 67 optical images and image j values for the average size μm of the precipitates that formed during the neutralisation of mine pit water with lime sodium hydroxide sodium carbonate bayer liquor and bayer precipitates are shown in fig 5 average particle size of the precipitates formed was in the order lime 730 μm bayer precipitates 184 μm sodium carbonate 62 μm sodium hydroxide 59 μm bayer liquor 20 μm based on the size of the flocs that formed for the different alkali it appeared that surface area alone was not driving the metal uptake capacity therefore based on the work by huang et al 62 it was believed that the encapsulation of metals in larger flocs precipitates was a key factor in metal removal 3 5 performance versus operational considerations the hydrochemical and geochemical behaviour of metals in solids must be considered during the treatment of mine pit water to avoid the release of metal contaminants once disposed of 19 72 depending upon the site conditions in some cases sludges are further treated for metal recovery or can be converted into an inert material via stabilisation or solidification prior to disposal to avoid further contamination 72 73 currently at mount morgan lime neutralised precipitates sludge are disposed of on a tailings beach that has periods of immersion with open pit water this form of disposal was chosen to utilise any residual caustic remaining in the sludge to slowly raise the ph of the water in the open pit however xrf analysis of samples collected at the mount morgan tailings beach table 6 shows that the metals have been leached back into the mine pit water reductions in cu 92 mn 87 and zn 96 and thus are being recirculated through the neutralisation tanks only slight reductions in calcium were observed 22 2 compared to 20 9 precipitates obtained after the treatment of mine pit water with different alkalis were leached using deionised water and mine pit water to determine the extent of metal leaching and thus precipitate stability concentration of metals mg l in di water and mine pit water after 24 h contact are provided in tables 7 and 8 respectively in di water the bayer precipitates appeared to be the most stable with leached al cu zn and fe concentrations being less than 0 05 mg l detection limit while only 1 30 mg l of mn leached minimal changes in ph were also observed remained neutral at around 7 25 bayer liquor and sodium hydroxide also showed minimal leached al cu zn and fe however at ph values of 6 04 and 5 67 respectively an increased amount of mn was leached 18 3 and 25 3 mg l compared to the bayer precipitates 1 30 mg l interestingly the mn concentration for lime which had the lowest ph value of 5 46 only observed 7 99 mg l the main mineralogical difference between bayer precipitates and lime with the other alkaline materials was the content of gypsum therefore the increased stability of mn in these precipitates was thought to be related to adsorption mechanisms previously explained 62 overall lime and sodium carbonate released the greatest amount of cu 2 10 and 2 19 mg l and zn 3 83 and 2 29 mg l back into solution the exposure of the precipitates to mine pit water for 24 h showed greater amounts of leached species precipitates obtained after mine pit water treatment with bayer precipitates had the greatest ph buffering capacity 5 73 after 24 h due to the formation of hydrotalcite and calcite as shown in fig 4 compared to all other alkaline materials whose ph was similar to the original 3 75 of the mine pit water between 3 80 and 3 90 this ph buffering capacity of bayer precipitates meant that bayer precipitates were able to reduce the concentrations of cu from 77 3 to 16 2 mg l zn from 48 9 to 34 7 mg l and al from 1233 to 42 9 mg l from mine pit water compared to other alkaline materials which showed an increase in the metal concentrations due to leaching table 8 however for all the tested alkaline materials including bayer precipitates this was not the case for mn when leaching the precipitates with mine pit water table 8 showed leaching for all tested alkaline materials due to low ph which resulted in enhanced mn concentrations ranging from 158 to 194 mg l in acidic conditions hydrotalcite present in bayer precipitates dissociates hence why bayer precipitates showed the highest concentration of leached mg resulted in increase in concentration to 3332 from 2265 mg l compared to concentrations ranging from 2386 to 2616 mg l for other alkaline materials it should be noted that the concentrations of mg cu mn and zn were significantly higher than the original mine pit water which supported the theory that the increased concentrations observed in this study compared to edraki et al 16 were due to the dissolution of precipitates in the disposed lime sludge overall bayer precipitates were the most stable in the presence of amd water this study has found bayer precipitates to perform as well as lime with the added benefits of increased sludge stability and the removal of manganese at lower ph however the mass required for attaining the desired ph is higher for bayer precipitates 40 g l to attain ph 7 5 compared to lime 6 16 g l to attain ph 7 7 and thus associated plant neutralising capacities would be negatively affected an added incentive for using bayer precipitates is that they are a waste by product of the alumina industry prepared from seawater neutralised residual bayer liquor bayer precipitates are also highly soluble in acidic conditions whereas the hydrophobic properties of lime means extensive mixing is required 19 22 by taking into account the cost and behaviour of lime it is suggested that using bayer precipitates for amd neutralisation and removal of metals is an attractive alternative both in terms of effectiveness and that one industry waste can be used to treat another s waste consideration into transportation costs and its feasibility requires further investigation 4 conclusions this study evaluated the hypothesis that waste bayer liquor and bayer precipitates from the alumina refining industry for the neutralisation of acid mine drainage the first question was whether the waste alkali materials could enhance the ph to achieve water discharge limits all investigated alkaline materials successfully raised the ph of treated mine pit water to meet discharge limits i e ph 6 5 8 5 the second research question was in relation to the effectiveness of removal of dissolved metal concentrations to satisfy regulations this study found that lime and bayer precipitates were more effective in removing the metals present in mount morgan mine pit water than either sodium hydroxide sodium carbonate or bayer liquor the removal capacity of bayer precipitates and lime was approximately the same for al cu fe zn and ni and shown to achieve acceptable discharge limits whereas in the case of mn at lower ph 6 5 7 5 bayer precipitates were more efficient than lime to decrease its concentration for complete mn removal ph 9 was required however raising the ph 9 was not viewed as acceptable since not only was the caustic nature of the water elevated but also aluminium content increased due to dissolution events therefore satisfying discharge limits for mn remains challenging the final research question concerned the search for a scientific explanation to explain differences in performance for the various alkali s the ability of the precipitates to encapsulate heavy metals was determined to be more important than surface area sludge produced after treatment with bayer precipitates was more stable and showed minimum metal leaching as compared to sludge produced after treatment with other alkali the mass of material required for attaining the desired ph was higher for bayer precipitates compared to lime but the capital cost for a system using lime was considered high due to its hydrophobic nature and the resultant extensive mixing required by considering the cost and behaviour of lime it was suggested that the use of tailings for the treatment of another mining waste was an interesting

14578,due to high specific surface area high biomass concentration and handling convenience packed bed reactor technology is a highly competitive option for nitrification of landfill leachates nitrification would solve the problem of insufficient ammonia retention faced by the high pressure membrane systems at the ihlenberg landfill which aims to achieve clean water recoveries up to 95 this study investigated the feasibility for ammonia removal using four lab scale reactors packed with three different packing materials coke expanded clay beads and polyethylene carrier over a period of about 400 days the research work studied the nitrification of two process streams reverse osmosis concentrate ro of raw leachate having high dissolved organics content and nanofiltration permeate of ro retentate with a low concentration of organics to identify advantages disadvantages arising from the differences in their composition the organics contained in the leachate were observed to cause inhibition due to this reason the maximum nitrification rate obtained in the presence of organics was about 570 g n nh4 m3 d whereas in their absence up to 1 2 kg n nh4 m3 d could be achieved although coke packing because of its higher specific surface area and rugged surface favoured faster biofilm development due to its ability to adsorb organics and thus also promoting the growth of heterotrophs it was found to be more vulnerable to clogging keywords ammonia oxidation biofilm landfill leachate nanofiltration permeate reverse osmosis concentrate 1 introduction landfill leachate formed predominantly from the percolation of precipitation through landfilled waste belongs to the class of highly polluted wastewaters they contain a wide range of hazardous pollutants both organic and inorganic in nature the immission of which can be very detrimental to all elements of an ecosystem 1 3 ammonium ions are one of the main constituents of landfill leachates whose release into surface waters can have acute effects oxygen depletion and ammonia toxicity unlike organic compounds content the ammonium nitrogen n nh4 concentration in leachates does not decrease with the ageing of a landfill 2 4 5 therefore its removal is of high importance in the long run ammonia concentration in the raw leachate about 600 mg n nh4 l from the ihlenberg landfill located close to lübeck germany has not changed much over the last decades 6 8 commissioned in 1983 with an area of 113 ha it is one of europe s largest hazardous waste landfills and produces about 500 m3 of methanogenic leachate per day since 1990 the leachate is being treated by two stage reverse osmosis ro attaining clean water recoveries of up to 85 9 following which the concentrate is re injected into the landfill table 1 shows the composition of the raw leachate at ihlenberg landfill and its ro retentate at the landfill sulphuric acid is used during reverse osmosis to prevent carbonate scaling due to which sulphate concentration in the ro concentrate is quite high however the german landfill ordinance 10 does not permit the recirculation of retentates unless it is part of a treatment process or a benefit will result from its practice since the leachate at ihlenberg is mature low biodegradable organics content its recirculation cannot do any good based on previous research 11 the landfill operator will start treating the ro concentrate further using a nanofiltration nf stage see fig 1 in the near future in order to halve its volume the retentate of nanofiltration may undergo evaporation followed by solidification and disposal as reported by peters 9 furthermore it is desired to handle the nf permeate using another ro stage the permeate of which should be suitable for direct discharge thereby enhancing the overall clean water recovery up to about 95 however as communicated by the project partner rts rochem technical services gmbh hamburg germany this final reverse osmosis treatment will not reject ammonia sufficiently as the n nh4 concentration in the nf permeate which will be the feed for the final ro stage will be quite high see fig 1 n nh4 concentration in the ro permeate will be much larger than the discharge limit of 10 mg n nh4 l therefore the project partner and the landfill operator desire ammonia removal via nitrification the authors were informed that the final ro stage would be able to retain nitrate ions sufficiently since they have a higher molecular weight than ammonium ions thus ammonia removal from this mature leachate using nitrification has been the focus of this research project the activated sludge process that we see today in the municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtp in industrialised countries is the result of chronological development of engineered suspended growth microbiological processes starting from a draw and fill reactor in 1913 12 from an initial goal of just removing organics and discharging the effluent into rivers wwtps have been continually developed to nitrify denitrify and remove ortho phosphate to prevent eutrophication in the receiving waters the use of suspended growth processes conventional activated sludge process and sequencing batch reactor for organics and ammonia removal from landfill leachates has been widely reported in literature 1 13 poor settleability of the sludge resulting in loss of biomass in the effluent is a major problem with suspended growth processes treating landfill leachates this can be avoided in fixed film reactors fixed film processes for nitrification of landfill leachates although only scarcely reported have thus been shown to be advantageous especially for mature leachates over the suspended growth processes 14 16 these studies have reported that the influence of temperature on nitrification in biofilms is low and that the effluent from biofilm reactors is nearly free from particulate matter attached growth processes originally discovered in 1893 which were forgone during the development of the activated sludge process regained interest in the early 1970s 12 leading to the development of several different reactor configurations or types including the packed bed reactors pbr since then numerous studies 17 25 on submerged packed bed biofilm reactors aimed at removing nutrients from wastewaters have reported them to be advantageous and highly competitive since they have a high biomass concentration as a result of which higher n nh4 loading rates or higher nitrification rates are possible allow immobilization of bacteria facilitating the enrichment of the slow growing nitrifiers in the biofilm produce little or practically no residual sludge thereby obviating large clarifiers and or associated settling problems met in suspended growth processes can withstand short term shock loads inhibitors and or toxins are less affected by low temperatures than suspended growth processes are compact flexible and reliable offering handling

nahco3 which decreased to about 6 8 after about 12 h in the systems equipped with ph controller it was possible to maintain the ph at 7 2 0 1 during the start up phase first batch ph was not monitored

wissenschaftlich technische werkstätten gmbh weilheim germany 3 1 start up phase for the first and second batches reactor 1 was operated with 5 times diluted ro retentate resembling raw leachate whereas reactors 2 4 were started with diluted nf permeate 3 times diluted using deionised water to obtain a n nh4 concentration similar to that of the raw leachate fig 3 shows the removal of ammonia in reactor systems 1 and 2 respectively which were filled with coke as packing material both batches 1 and 2 in reactor system r1 and batch 1 in r2 were executed without ph control in system r2 the ph was controlled manually by adding nahco3 during batch 2 these results indicate the necessity of alkalinity for the efficiency of nitrification raw leachate contains inherent alkalinity mainly as hco3 due to its near neutral ph which counters the protons released during the first step of the nitrification process and buffers the system due to this reason nitrification proceeds until the buffer capacity is almost entirely consumed in batch 2 ph was measured in r1 and was found to decline gradually from an initial value of 8 5 to 6 0 in 30 days on the other hand nanofiltration permeate lacks buffer capacity since an nf membrane can retain some or most of the hco3 ions 30 therefore ammonia removal was poor in batch 1 in r2 whereas more than 99 ammonia were removed in batch 2 with the addition of nahco3 the observations made with reactors 3 and 4 during the start up phase with and without ph control were very similar to r2 the importance of ph and its reliance on the availability of inorganic carbon can be verified from fig 4 which depicts the dependence of nitrification activity reflected by do concentration on ph during the third batch dissolved oxygen concentration temperature and ph in r2 operated with 1 3 diluted nf permeate were recorded at 15 min intervals over a period of 2 days during these two days aeration was maintained constant and temperature was measured to be 26 7 0 6 c therefore the do concentration is only dependent on the nitrification rate consumption of oxygen the mass balance for do may be expressed as mass of dissolved oxygen in the reactor system mass of oxygen transferred by aeration mass of oxygen consumed by nitrification nitrification is both directly and indirectly relationship between ph and hco3 concentration dependent on ph 31 therefore do concentration increases as seen in fig 4 implying a decrease in nitrification rate when ph falls below 6 0 and results in saturation of do when nitrification ultimately ceases at still lower ph 3 2 comparison of different wastewater matrices the difference in compositions of ro retentate and nf permeate gave rise to a significant difference in the nitrification rates achieved with them see fig 5 trials were conducted with different dilutions in deionised water of ro concentrate and nf permeate maintaining similar starting concentrations of ammonia nitrogen fig 5a and b shows ammonia removal trends attained in different reactors during the initial 4 months and after about 7 months of operation respectively from the measured values for tn n no2 and n no3 data not shown it could be verified that complete nitrification was achieved in all the trials volumetric ammonia oxidation rates of about 310 and 380 g n nh4 m3 d were obtained in r2 with coke packing respectively with 1 4 and 1 2 dilutions of nf permeate during the initial 4 months fig 5a during the same time period the observed nitrification rates in r1 also packed with coke with 1 5 and 1 2 dilutions of ro concentrate respectively were about 200 and 120 g n nh4 m3 d only since the experiments were conducted in batch fashion the nitrification rates were estimated according to eq 1 throughout the study 1 ammonia removal rate slope of the curve volume of waste water treated packed bed volume where slope of the curve for ammonium nitrogen reduction as mg n nh4 l d volume of wastewater treated 25 l and packed bed volume in l which gives ammonia removal rate as mass of n nh4 removed per day per unit volume of reactor the observed flat portion in the curve r1 ro df 2 fig 5a was due to a failure in the ph control which was done manually the buffer capacity in the wastewater was exhausted during a weekend due to which the ph in the system was decreased to about 6 4 resulting in stagnation of nitrification and the corresponding plateau in this case the nitrification rate was calculated using the slope of the curve during the initial days before the failure in ph control with the development of the biofilm a gradual increase was observed in the ammonia oxidation rates in all the reactors the nitrification rates with dilutions of nf permeate increased to about 580 g n nh4 m3 d by 7 months whereas with dilutions of ro retentate with similar n nh4 starting concentrations only about 325 g n nh4 m3 d could be attained fig 5b which were about 40 lower than the rates achieved with nf permeate the ro concentrate contains only negligible amounts of heavy metals 8 and has only slightly higher salinity content than the nf permeate as the chloride and electrical conductivity values in table 4 showed therefore it is probable that the organic compounds contained in the ro concentrate caused the observed inhibition of nitrification since the leachate at ihlenberg landfill is mature recalcitrant humic like compounds constitute a large fraction of the contained dissolved organics which has been widely reported to cause problems during biological treatment 1 13 it is also possible that the leachate used in this study contained inhibitory organic compounds which are not commonly found in the leachates from the more typical non hazardous waste landfills originating from the hazardous wastes dumped at the landfill site for instance doyle et al 32 and horan et al 33 have suggested dissolved organic compounds to be the possible cause for the inhibition of nitrification in the mature landfill leachates used in their works to validate that the observed inhibition of nitrification was due to the organics contained in the ro retentate experiments were performed by our group as part of a sub project with suspended growth activated sludge in sequencing batch reactors sbr batch trials were conducted in parallel by feeding two reactors each with similar working volumes mixed liquor suspended solids concentrations ph temperature and aeration conditions with dilutions of ro concentrate and nf permeate sbr cycles were conducted with starting n nh4 concentrations of about 50 mg l in the beginning progressively increasing it up to 600 mg l wherein the concentrations of organics in the reactors were also increasing corresponding to the wastewater fed ammonia oxidation rate consumption of alkali and the consumption of dissolved oxygen were found to be low in the reactor fed with solutions of ro concentrate under similar experimental conditions nitrification rates in diluted ro retentates were 30 80 lower than in the dilutions of nf permeate the differences in the rates were increasing with increase in organic load with reactors r3 and r4 operation was continued until 11th and 13th months respectively with dilutions of the ro concentrate 1 3 and 1 2 dilutions in deionised water nitrification rates in these reactors increased gradually up to about 570 g n nh4 m3 d however trials with undiluted ro concentrate failed miserably the reasons for this are expected to be three fold 1 inhibition due to aforementioned organic compounds which were at a much higher concentration in the ro retentate 2 higher salinity of the ro concentrate and 3 free ammonia inhibition besides extensive foaming aeration caused the ph to increase up to 8 5 due to the stripping of co2 since the alkalinity content in ro retentate is high this can result in the formation of higher amounts of free ammonia also because the ro concentrate contained about 3 2 g n nh4 l trials with dilutions of nf permeate 1 4 1 3 and 1 2 showed a possibility to attain nitrification rates of up to about 1 2 kg n nh4 m3 d experiments were not conducted with undiluted nf permeate however it is speculated that when operated with nf permeate macro and micro nutrients that are required for biofilm growth should be made available for instance nf permeate will lack ortho phosphate which was however contained in raw leachate furthermore the tolerance of the bacteria towards the high chloride content in the nf permeate about 30 g l is yet to be studied as it was seen before nf permeate lacks buffer capacity compared to ro concentrate acid neutralizing capacities ks4 3 of ro retentate and nf permeate were measured following the standard method din 38409 7 29 to be 123 and 9 6 mmol h l respectively fairly accordingly total inorganic carbon concentrations of about 1385 32 and 188 16 mg l 115 4 2 7 and 15 7 1 3 mmol l respectively were measured in ro concentrate and nf permeate respectively this implies that nitrification of nf permeate would require larger quantities of inorganic carbon source alkali to be added in comparison to raw leachate or its reverse osmosis concentrate from the numerous trials conducted with different dilutions of ro retentate and nf permeate average external alkalinity requirements for the two leachate matrices were estimated to be about 6 6 1 4 and 10 6 1 0 g nahco3 g n nh4 oxidised respectively it can be seen that a part of the inherent alkalinity of ro retentate is used first before an external source has to be added on the other hand due to the lack of buffer capacity in nf permeate an amount of external alkali source similar to the theoretical requirement of 12 g nahco3 g n nh4 oxidised was consumed 3 3 comparison of different packing materials for the same wastewater matrix reactor systems r1 and r2 initially showed up to about 40 higher nitrification rates than r3 and r4 both of which had comparable oxidation rates data not shown nitrification rates are dependent on media properties and have been reported to increase with decrease in size of the media increase in surface roughness and irregularities in particle shape 19 34 35 it can therefore be inferred that smaller mean particle diameter and the resulting larger specific surface area of coke packing table 2 along with its rugged nature promoted faster biofilm development in these reactors after a relatively stable biofilm was achieved in the reactors the differences in nitrification rates between the different packing materials with the same leachate matrix were not pronounced besides higher nitrification rates reactors r1 and r2 were able to remove organics up to 90 via adsorption during the initial trials carried out with raw leachate however as adsorption capacities decreased and were finally exhausted toc removal in r1 and r2 were comparable to those in r3 and r4 it was observed that up to 40 of the organic matter contained in the raw leachate was degradable which matches with the bod5 cod ratio 0 39 determined by the landfill operator see table 1 the reactors were not backwashed during the period of this study the reactors got clogged photographs in supporting material in the following time order r1 after about 6 months r2 8 months and r3 11 months r4 packed with polythene carrier and operated with both leachate matrices did not suffer from any blockage during the study period possibly because of its high porosity 0 89 the order in which the reactors got plugged may be explained in that r1 was operated only with dilutions of ro concentrate whereas several batches in reactors r2 and r3 were conducted with dilutions of nf permeate also since r1 with coke packing was always operated with a wastewater matrix laden with organic compounds it was prone to clogging due to adsorption and consequent growth of heterotrophs 36 on the other hand reactor r3 with expanded clay beads as packing although had a lower bed porosity 0 55 compared to r1 and r2 0 63 and 0 74 respectively could be operated for longer periods before it was blocked severely this could have been possibly due to low the adsorption capacity of clay beads 3 4 perspectives for practical application a schematic for practical application of nitrification using a continuously operated pbr with recirculation for treating the nanofiltration permeate is shown in fig 6 based on the experiences from this study pe carrier which has high porosity and low adsorption capacity would be the preferred packing material the reactor will be operated to achieve a low n nh4 concentration about 10 mg l in the effluent at steady state due to recirculation whose flow rate would be much higher compared to that of the nf permeate the ammonium nitrogen concentration in the influent to the reactor would be about 20 mg l with up flow velocities of about 20 m h the hydraulic retention time in the reactor per pass would be of the order of a few minutes comparable to that in the study of peladan et al 21 under steady conditions the effluent from the reactor will contain high concentrations of nitrate nitrogen approximately equal to the n nh4 concentration in feed and other inert species like cl na etc which will be of the order of concentrations contained in the feed nf permeate as communicated by the project partner these constituents could be well retained by the subsequent ro stage thus the ro permeate would be suitable for direct discharge thereby achieving clean water recoveries up to 95 percent the brine from reverse osmosis might get treated using crystallisation as reported by rautenbach and linn 7 the effect of salinity on nitrification and the possibility for acclimatising the bacteria or the necessity for exploiting halophilic nitrifiers remains to be investigated studies shall also be conducted in pilot scale at the ihlenberg landfill site to validate the process and to facilitate the estimation of energy requirements gathering microbiological data is beyond the scope of this work the reactors have been disassembled and the experimental setup adapted to perform continuous flow trials so as to validate the feasibility of the scheme proposed in fig 6 and to investigate the effect of salinity on nitrification efficiency this study demonstrates the potential of packed bed reactors for achieving high rate nitrification of mature landfill leachates explains the aspects of concern pertaining to the compositions of the membrane treated leachate streams and characteristics of packing media for the smooth functioning of a packed bed nitrification system and paves way to achieve reliable and compact reactors for ammonia removal from landfill leachates 4 conclusions nf permeate compared to ro concentrate was found to lack alkalinity due to this reason the need for external inorganic carbon source for the nitrification of the former was much greater the requirements for external alkali sources were about 10 6 1 0 and 6 6 1 4 g nahco3 g n nh4 oxidised respectively dissolved organics contained in ro concentrate were observed to cause inhibition during the study period maximum nitrification rates of about 0 57 and 1 2 kg n nh4 m3 d were achieved with dilutions of ro concentrate and nf permeate respectively nitrification of nf permeate undiluted and the effect of high chloride content remains to be investigated coke due to its smaller particle size and rugged surface facilitated faster biofilm development however due to its ability to adsorb organics which were partially degradable and thereby also supporting the growth of heterotrophs it was the first to suffer from clogging followed by clay beads packing acknowledgements the

14578,due to high specific surface area high biomass concentration and handling convenience packed bed reactor technology is a highly competitive option for nitrification of landfill leachates nitrification would solve the problem of insufficient ammonia retention faced by the high pressure membrane systems at the ihlenberg landfill which aims to achieve clean water recoveries up to 95 this study investigated the feasibility for ammonia removal using four lab scale reactors packed with three different packing materials coke expanded clay beads and polyethylene carrier over a period of about 400 days the research work studied the nitrification of two process streams reverse osmosis concentrate ro of raw leachate having high dissolved organics content and nanofiltration permeate of ro retentate with a low concentration of organics to identify advantages disadvantages arising from the differences in their composition the organics contained in the leachate were observed to cause inhibition due to this reason the maximum nitrification rate obtained in the presence of organics was about 570 g n nh4 m3 d whereas in their absence up to 1 2 kg n nh4 m3 d could be achieved although coke packing because of its higher specific surface area and rugged surface favoured faster biofilm development due to its ability to adsorb organics and thus also promoting the growth of heterotrophs it was found to be more vulnerable to clogging keywords ammonia oxidation biofilm landfill leachate nanofiltration permeate reverse osmosis concentrate 1 introduction landfill leachate formed predominantly from the percolation of precipitation through landfilled waste belongs to the class of highly polluted wastewaters they contain a wide range of hazardous pollutants both organic and inorganic in nature the immission of which can be very detrimental to all elements of an ecosystem 1 3 ammonium ions are one of the main constituents of landfill leachates whose release into surface waters can have acute effects oxygen depletion and ammonia toxicity unlike organic compounds content the ammonium nitrogen n nh4 concentration in leachates does not decrease with the ageing of a landfill 2 4 5 therefore its removal is of high importance in the long run ammonia concentration in the raw leachate about 600 mg n nh4 l from the ihlenberg landfill located close to lübeck germany has not changed much over the last decades 6 8 commissioned in 1983 with an area of 113 ha it is one of europe s largest hazardous waste landfills and produces about 500 m3 of methanogenic leachate per day since 1990 the leachate is being treated by two stage reverse osmosis ro attaining clean water recoveries of up to 85 9 following which the concentrate is re injected into the landfill table 1 shows the composition of the raw leachate at ihlenberg landfill and its ro retentate at the landfill sulphuric acid is used during reverse osmosis to prevent carbonate scaling due to which sulphate concentration in the ro concentrate is quite high however the german landfill ordinance 10 does not permit the recirculation of retentates unless it is part of a treatment process or a benefit will result from its practice since the leachate at ihlenberg is mature low biodegradable organics content its recirculation cannot do any good based on previous research 11 the landfill operator will start treating the ro concentrate further using a nanofiltration nf stage see fig 1 in the near future in order to halve its volume the retentate of nanofiltration may undergo evaporation followed by solidification and disposal as reported by peters 9 furthermore it is desired to handle the nf permeate using another ro stage the permeate of which should be suitable for direct discharge thereby enhancing the overall clean water recovery up to about 95 however as communicated by the project partner rts rochem technical services gmbh hamburg germany this final reverse osmosis treatment will not reject ammonia sufficiently as the n nh4 concentration in the nf permeate which will be the feed for the final ro stage will be quite high see fig 1 n nh4 concentration in the ro permeate will be much larger than the discharge limit of 10 mg n nh4 l therefore the project partner and the landfill operator desire ammonia removal via nitrification the authors were informed that the final ro stage would be able to retain nitrate ions sufficiently since they have a higher molecular weight than ammonium ions thus ammonia removal from this mature leachate using nitrification has been the focus of this research project the activated sludge process that we see today in the municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtp in industrialised countries is the result of chronological development of engineered suspended growth microbiological processes starting from a draw and fill reactor in 1913 12 from an initial goal of just removing organics and discharging the effluent into rivers wwtps have been continually developed to nitrify denitrify and remove ortho phosphate to prevent eutrophication in the receiving waters the use of suspended growth processes conventional activated sludge process and sequencing batch reactor for organics and ammonia removal from landfill leachates has been widely reported in literature 1 13 poor settleability of the sludge resulting in loss of biomass in the effluent is a major problem with suspended growth processes treating landfill leachates this can be avoided in fixed film reactors fixed film processes for nitrification of landfill leachates although only scarcely reported have thus been shown to be advantageous especially for mature leachates over the suspended growth processes 14 16 these studies have reported that the influence of temperature on nitrification in biofilms is low and that the effluent from biofilm reactors is nearly free from particulate matter attached growth processes originally discovered in 1893 which were forgone during the development of the activated sludge process regained interest in the early 1970s 12 leading to the development of several different reactor configurations or types including the packed bed reactors pbr since then numerous studies 17 25 on submerged packed bed biofilm reactors aimed at removing nutrients from wastewaters have reported them to be advantageous and highly competitive since they have a high biomass concentration as a result of which higher n nh4 loading rates or higher nitrification rates are possible allow immobilization of bacteria facilitating the enrichment of the slow growing nitrifiers in the biofilm produce little or practically no residual sludge thereby obviating large clarifiers and or associated settling problems met in suspended growth processes can withstand short term shock loads inhibitors and or toxins are less affected by low temperatures than suspended growth processes are compact flexible and reliable offering handling convenience well suited especially for treating lower wastewater volumes e g industrial wastewaters for these reasons pbrs were chosen for investigating nitrification of the leachate from the

580 g n nh4 m3 d by 7 months whereas with dilutions of ro retentate with similar n nh4 starting concentrations only about 325 g n nh4 m3 d could be attained fig 5b which were about 40 lower than the rates achieved with nf permeate the ro concentrate contains only negligible amounts of heavy metals 8 and has only slightly higher salinity content than the nf permeate as the chloride and electrical conductivity values in table 4 showed therefore it is probable that the organic compounds contained in the ro concentrate caused the observed inhibition of nitrification since the leachate at ihlenberg landfill is mature recalcitrant humic like compounds constitute a large fraction of the contained dissolved organics which has been widely reported to cause problems during biological treatment 1 13 it is also possible that the leachate used in this study contained inhibitory organic compounds which are not commonly found in the leachates from the more typical non hazardous waste landfills originating from the hazardous wastes dumped at the landfill site for instance doyle et al 32 and horan et al 33 have suggested dissolved organic compounds to be the possible cause for the inhibition of nitrification in the mature landfill leachates used in their works to validate that the observed inhibition of nitrification was due to the organics contained in the ro retentate experiments were performed by our group as part of a sub project with suspended growth activated sludge in sequencing batch reactors sbr batch trials were conducted in parallel by feeding two reactors each with similar working volumes mixed liquor suspended solids concentrations ph temperature and aeration conditions with dilutions of ro concentrate and nf permeate sbr cycles were conducted with starting n nh4 concentrations of about 50 mg l in the beginning progressively increasing it up to 600 mg l wherein the concentrations of organics in the reactors were also increasing corresponding to the wastewater fed ammonia oxidation rate consumption of alkali and the consumption of dissolved oxygen were found to be low in the reactor fed with solutions of ro concentrate under similar experimental conditions nitrification rates in diluted ro retentates were 30 80 lower than in the dilutions of nf permeate the differences in the rates were increasing with increase in organic load with reactors r3 and r4 operation was continued until 11th and 13th months respectively with dilutions of the ro concentrate 1 3 and 1 2 dilutions in deionised water nitrification rates in these reactors increased gradually up to about 570 g n nh4 m3 d however trials with undiluted ro concentrate failed miserably the reasons for this are expected to be three fold 1 inhibition due to aforementioned organic compounds which were at a much higher concentration in the ro retentate 2 higher salinity of the ro concentrate and 3 free ammonia inhibition besides extensive foaming aeration caused the ph to increase up to 8 5 due to the stripping of co2 since the alkalinity content in ro retentate is high this can result in the formation of higher amounts of free ammonia also because the ro concentrate contained about 3 2 g n nh4 l trials with dilutions of nf permeate 1 4 1 3 and 1 2 showed a possibility to attain nitrification rates of up to about 1 2 kg n nh4 m3 d experiments were not conducted with undiluted nf permeate however it is speculated that when operated with nf permeate macro and micro nutrients that are required for biofilm growth should be made available for instance nf permeate will lack ortho phosphate which was however contained in raw leachate furthermore the tolerance of the bacteria towards the high chloride content in the nf permeate about 30 g l is yet to be studied as it was seen before nf permeate lacks buffer capacity compared to ro concentrate acid neutralizing capacities ks4 3 of ro retentate and nf permeate were measured following the standard method din 38409 7 29 to be 123 and 9 6 mmol h l respectively fairly accordingly total inorganic carbon concentrations of about 1385 32 and 188 16 mg l 115 4 2 7 and 15 7 1 3 mmol l respectively were measured in ro concentrate and nf permeate respectively this implies that nitrification of nf permeate would require larger quantities of inorganic carbon source alkali to be added in comparison to raw leachate or its reverse osmosis concentrate from the numerous trials conducted with different dilutions of ro retentate and nf permeate average external alkalinity requirements for the two leachate matrices were estimated to be about 6 6 1 4 and 10 6 1 0 g nahco3 g n nh4 oxidised respectively it can be seen that a part of the inherent alkalinity of ro retentate is used first before an external source has to be added on the other hand due to the lack of buffer capacity in nf permeate an amount of external alkali source similar to the theoretical requirement of 12 g nahco3 g n nh4 oxidised was consumed 3 3 comparison of different packing materials for the same wastewater matrix reactor systems r1 and r2 initially showed up to about 40 higher nitrification rates than r3 and r4 both of which had comparable oxidation rates data not shown nitrification rates are dependent on media properties and have been reported to increase with decrease in size of the media increase in surface roughness and irregularities in particle shape 19 34 35 it can therefore be inferred that smaller mean particle diameter and the resulting larger specific surface area of coke packing table 2 along with its rugged nature promoted faster biofilm development in these reactors after a relatively stable biofilm was achieved in the reactors the differences in nitrification rates between the different packing materials with the same leachate matrix were not pronounced besides higher nitrification rates reactors r1 and r2 were able to remove organics up to 90 via adsorption during the initial trials carried out with raw leachate however as adsorption capacities decreased and were finally exhausted toc removal in r1 and r2 were comparable to those in r3 and r4 it was observed that up to 40 of the organic matter contained in the raw leachate was degradable which matches with the bod5 cod ratio 0 39 determined by the landfill operator see table 1 the reactors were not backwashed during the period of this study the reactors got clogged photographs in supporting material in the following time order r1 after about 6 months r2 8 months and r3 11 months r4 packed with polythene carrier and operated with both leachate matrices did not suffer from any blockage during the study period possibly because of its high porosity 0 89 the order in which the reactors got plugged may be explained in that r1 was operated only with dilutions of ro concentrate whereas several batches in reactors r2 and r3 were conducted with dilutions of nf permeate also since r1 with coke packing was always operated with a wastewater matrix laden with organic compounds it was prone to clogging due to adsorption and consequent growth of heterotrophs 36 on the other hand reactor r3 with expanded clay beads as packing although had a lower bed porosity 0 55 compared to r1 and r2 0 63 and 0 74 respectively could be operated for longer periods before it was blocked severely this could have been possibly due to low the adsorption capacity of clay beads 3 4 perspectives for practical application a schematic for practical application of nitrification using a continuously operated pbr with recirculation for treating the nanofiltration permeate is shown in fig 6 based on the experiences from this study pe carrier which has high porosity and low adsorption capacity would be the preferred packing material the reactor will be operated to achieve a low n nh4 concentration about 10 mg l in the effluent at steady state due to recirculation whose flow rate would be much higher compared to that of the nf permeate the ammonium nitrogen concentration in the influent to the reactor would be about 20 mg l with up flow velocities of about 20 m h the hydraulic retention time in the reactor per pass would be of the order of a few minutes comparable to that in the study of peladan et al 21 under steady conditions the effluent from the reactor will contain high concentrations of nitrate nitrogen approximately equal to the n nh4 concentration in feed and other inert species like cl na etc which will be of the order of concentrations contained in the feed nf permeate as communicated by the project partner these constituents could be well retained by the subsequent ro stage thus the ro permeate would be suitable for direct discharge thereby achieving clean water recoveries up to 95 percent the brine from reverse osmosis might get treated using crystallisation as reported by rautenbach and linn 7 the effect of salinity on nitrification and the possibility for acclimatising the bacteria or the necessity for exploiting halophilic nitrifiers remains to be investigated studies shall also be conducted in pilot scale at the ihlenberg landfill site to validate the process and to facilitate the estimation of energy requirements gathering microbiological data is beyond the scope of this work the reactors have been disassembled and the experimental setup adapted to perform continuous flow trials so as to validate the feasibility of the scheme proposed in fig 6 and to investigate the effect of salinity on nitrification efficiency this study demonstrates the potential of packed bed reactors for achieving high rate nitrification of mature landfill leachates explains the aspects of concern pertaining to the compositions of the membrane treated leachate streams and characteristics of packing media for the smooth functioning of a packed bed nitrification system and paves way to achieve reliable and compact reactors for ammonia removal from landfill leachates 4 conclusions nf permeate compared to ro concentrate was found to lack alkalinity due to this reason the need for external inorganic carbon source for the nitrification of the former was much greater the requirements for external alkali sources were about 10 6 1 0 and 6 6 1 4 g nahco3 g n nh4 oxidised respectively dissolved organics contained in ro concentrate were observed to cause inhibition during the study period maximum nitrification rates of about 0 57 and 1 2 kg n nh4 m3 d were achieved with dilutions of ro concentrate and nf permeate respectively nitrification of nf permeate undiluted and the effect of high chloride content remains to be investigated coke due to its smaller particle size and rugged surface facilitated faster biofilm development however due to its ability to adsorb organics which were partially degradable and thereby also supporting the growth of heterotrophs it was the first to suffer from clogging followed by clay beads packing acknowledgements the

14579,the present study was carried out to investigate the influence of cod ammonia ratio on simultaneous removal of nitrogen and carbon in the form of nh4 n and cod cow dung slurry was taken as a source of microbial culture and acclimatized with dextrose and nh4cl as carbon and nitrogen source cod ammonia ratio is important parameter in nitrification process and was varied from 2 to 10 2 4 6 8 10 by concurrently varying influent cod 100 2500 mg l and nh4 n concentration 50 250 mg l results reveal that cod ammonia ratio has a direct correlation with cod removal efficiency as when cod ammonia ratio increased from 2 to 10 cod removal efficiency also increased from 80 to 98 maximum nh4 n removal efficiency 99 4 was obtained at low cod ammonia ratio at its maximum the corresponding removal of nh4 n and cod was obtained with cod ammonia ratio of 2 and 48 h retention time rt response surface methodology rsm using matlab software was used for the optimization of rt cod ammonia ratio influent concentration of cod and nh4 n response surface was generated in order to obtain the optimum value of each parameter in the nitrification process the optimized parameters by rsm were obtained at cod ammonia ratio of 4 with 41 h rt keywords biodegradation nh4 n cod ammonia ratio rsm nitrification 1 introduction ammonium ion nh4 is a major content that serves as an essential nutrient for aquatic plants and animals in surface water most of the ammonia nh3 is found in the form of nh4 according to the existing ph this fact approximates the concentration of all reduced nitrogen in the form of ammonia and combined ammonium which are known as ammonia nitrogen this can be accounted by measuring concentration of the ammonium ions 1 bacteria convert nitrogen from decaying plant animal material and waste products in soil or water to ammonia through ammonification the alternative sources of organic matter for ammonification comprise industrial waste agricultural runoff and sewage treatment effluent aquatic organisms are very sensitive to ammonia nitrogen and also eutrophication occurs due to high nitrogen load in the effluent 2 3 the lethal concentration lc of ammonia n for fish is 0 44 mg l chemical oxygen demand cod is another parameter representing organic pollutant load it is a major problem found in the surface water due to industrial effluent discharge high cod causes depletion of oxygen in surface water and can lead to the development of septic conditions generally high cod and nh4 n concentration come from various types of industries such as steel pulp and paper etc 3 ammonia is one of the intermediate product of many organic compounds formed during anaerobic degradation and can inhibit the methanogenesis process it is reported that high concentration of ammonia 1700 1800 mg l inhibits the anaerobic digester performance 4 nitrification conversion of ammonia to nitrate completes in two steps by two kinds of bacteria ammonium and nitrite oxidizers first ammonia n is converted to nitrite n by ammonium oxidizer and then to nitrate n by nitrite oxidizers in aerobic reactor effluent of nitrification reactor rich in nitrate n can be converted to n2 gas via denitrification process in an anoxic reactor by denitrifying bacteria and hereby completing the nitrogen cycle 5 8 1 a n h 4 a m m o n i u m o x i d i z e r n o 2 2 h h 2 o 1 b n o 2 1 5 o 2 n i t r i t e o x i d i z e r n o 3 the cod ammonia c n ratio which represents the relative amount of carbon and nitrogen source in the system can influence the nitrification and denitrification process as well as removal of cod simultaneously by microorganism it is reported that the c n ratio below 5 significantly affects the nitrification process and the removal of total nitrogen drops below 50 9 whereas a high c n ratio 7 30 provides corresponding high cod removal efficiency of around 92 due to the dominance of heterotrophic bacteria over the autotrophic bacteria 9 11 hence c n ratio is a crucial factor for the simultaneous removal of cod and nitrogen compounds from a nitrification reactor also both ammonium and nitrite oxidizers are sensitive to high concentration of their own substrates showing substrate inhibition another factor free ammonia fa can also inhibit both ammonium and nitrite oxidizer nitrite oxidizer nitrobacter is much more sensitive to fa even at 0 1 1 0 mg l than ammonium oxidizer nitrosomonas with 10 150 mg l 12 14 campos et al 15 reported that fa inhibition affects only ammonium oxidizer but not nitrite oxidizer therefore it is very necessary to maintain the level of fa in the reactor at its low concentration to avoid the inhibition to ammonium and nitrite oxidation 16 17 the effect of different operating parameters such as ph oxidation reduction potential c n ratio air flow rate reaction time and influent concentration on the nitrification performance are reported in various literatures 2 18 19 these operating parameters also influence the unit operation cost so that optimization is required to reduce the time and cost as well as to meet the dischargeable and good effluent quality through improvement of treatment system 4 18 many works have been reported for treatment of ammonia n and cod in wastewater using different types of bioreactors such as oxidation ditch sequencing batch reactor continuous stirred tank and biofilm airlift suspension reactor 19 22 however moving bed bioreactor mbbr is preferred due to its ease of handling and high efficiency for industrial wastewater treatment mbbr is an efficient attached growth process in which biofilm adhered to different carrier substance and move freely with the force of inlet or gas bubbles 23 mbbr possesses various advantages such as less space requirement compactness less dependent on biomass separation less sensitivity and better recovery during shock loadings due to the availability of the biofilm media with high specific surface area holding high amount of biomass 24 for optimization of process parameters response surface methodology rsm is reported as effective tool rsm is a collection of statistical and mathematical method used for the optimization of a particular process hasan et al 2 used rsm tool for optimization of cod load aeration rate and hrt to find removal performance of cod nh4 n and mn2 in this study effect of c n ratio on simultaneous removal of cod and nh4 n has been investigated by varying both cod and nh4 n concentration at the same time using aerobic mbbr rsm tool was used to evaluate the interaction effects of operating parameters on simultaneous removal of nh4 n and cod 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals all chemicals for feed composition as well as reagent preparation for various parameter analysis were of analytical grade and procured from merck india 2 2 acclimation of inoculated sludge biomass acclimatization was done in an one liter aerobic batch reactor inoculated with cow dung slurry as a source

added aerobic condition was maintained inside the reactor with the help of aeration pump connected with aeration stone the ph 7 5 0 5 was maintained inside the reactor by adding 0 1 n hcl nahco3 and the temperature were maintained at 30 2 0 c the schematic diagram of experimental setup is shown in fig 1 acclimatization was conducted for 30 days until the steady state condition was achieved 2 3 serum bottle reactor startup and operation after acclimatization in attached growth aerobic batch reactor serum bottle reactors ideal to the original reactor were started with 50 ml capacity 0 4 g sponge cubes 20 sponges were added in serum bottle reactor which was 40 volume of the reactor these mini reactors were operated at similar conditions to its original source batch reactor to investigate the performance of different c n ratio on the simultaneous removal of cod and nh4 n in the present study c n ratio was varied from 2 to 10 by and changing the concentration of cod and nh4 n towards higher end such as cod nh4 n 100 50 to 2500 250 while both the contents were simultaneously increased 2 4 analytical methods the removal efficiency was determined by analyzing the samples taken from feed influent sample and samples taken from reactor after 24 and 48 h of reaction time rt the samples were centrifuged at 2000 rpm remi rm 12c bl india for 20 min prior analysis according to standard methods 25 cod was estimated by closed reflux titrimetric method cod analysis was performed using cod vials of 10 ml capacity initially 1 5 ml digestion solution k2cr2o7 reagent and 3 5 ml sulfuric acid reagent was added then 2 5 ml of sample was added and vials were inverted several times to mix solution completely afterwards vials were placed in the preheated digester spectroquant tr 320 merck germany at 148 2 c for 2 h after digestion samples were cooled to room temperature and titrate against 0 1 m ferrous ammonium sulfate fas titrant in presence of ferroin indicator nh4 n concentration was measured by phenate method in this method standards of known concentration of nh4 n was prepared and absorbance has taken in uv spectrophotometer uv 1800 shimadzu japan against blank solution at 640 nm thereafter samples absorbance are taken and compared with calibration curve similarly no3 n concentration was determined by an ultraviolet screening method at wavelength of 220 and 275 nm nitrite was measured using colorimetric method at 543 nm using the uv spectrophotometer 2 5 microscopic analysis scanning electron microscopy sem analysis was conducted to determine structural morphology of the microorganisms attached to the supporting biofilm sponge this analysis was performed by zeiss evo series scanning electron microscope evo18 samples were gold coated and sem images were taken at various magnifications 2 6 experimental design the effect of c n ratio on nh4 n and cod removal was analyzed in serum bottle reactor by simultaneously varying the influent concentration of nh4 n and cod optimization of each operating parameters such as rt c n ratio influent cod and influent nh4 n was done using rsm tool in matlab 7 9 rsm model design can be described by interaction model using the following eq 1 1 z β1 β2 p β3 q β4 r β5 p q β6 q r β7 r p where z is the response β1 β2 β3 β4 β5 β6 β7 are the interaction coefficients and p q and r are process parameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of c n ratio on nh4 n no2 n and no3 n removal in mbbr the influent nh4 n concentration was varied as 50 100 150 200 and 250 mg l and simultaneously varying the influent cod concentration 100 400 900 1600 and 2500 mg l to provide c n ratio of 2 4 6 8 and 10 fig 2 shows the removal of nh4 n under different c n ratio after the acclimation period when c n ratio was low c n 2 83 60 removal of nh4 n was obtained within 24 h the maximum removal of nh4 n 99 14 was observed at 48 h with a c n ratio of 2 soltani et al 1 reported 97 2 removal efficiency with an initial nh4 n concentration of 50 mg l with increasing c n ratio from 2 to 8 ammonia removal decreased gradually to 80 whereas a further increase of c n to 10 the removal efficiency decreased to 60 during this experimental period a sudden increase in the ph 9 9 5 was observed the increase in ph is might be due to the accumulation of nh4oh because nh4cl concentration was increased from 100 to 250 mg l to provide c n ratio of 2 10 chen et al 26 investigated the removal performance of cod and nh4 n in mbbr using novel suspended carrier by coating sponge on inside and outside of a hard polyethylene ring high removal rate of cod 99 5 1 1 and nh4 n 93 6 2 3 has been reported compare to commercial carrier 74 9 2 7 and 40 0 1 8 27 28 shammas et al 29 reported that optimum ph for nitrification is 8 4 and maximum rate of nitrification occurs between 7 8 and 8 9 in this study efficient nitrification occurs at low c n ratio might be due absence of substrate inhibition and possibility of dominance of nitrifying bacteria however when the influent nh4 n concentration increases nitrification drops with decrease in removal of nh4 n this might be due to accumulation of nh4oh resulting in the increase of alkalinity and the consumption of co2 by autotrophic microorganism for their growth the higher ammonia removal at low c n ratio fig 2 is due to dominance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria whereas at higher c n ratio the heterotrophic bacteria dominate the biomass resulting in lower preference to nh4 n consumption 30 the significant drop in nh4 n removal efficiency at high cod ammonia ratio of 10 has been reported by lin et al 9 nitrite is intermediate product of nh4 n oxidation to nitrate in the nitrification reactor by autotrophic microorganisms fig 3 depicts the nitrite accumulation at influent concentrations 50 250 mg l of nh4 n at 48 h of reactor operation with various c n ratios nitrite accumulation increased from 0 59 to 1 99 mg l with the increase of nh4 n concentration from 50 to 250 mg l the increase in nitrite accumulation with increasing c n ratio indicates that nitrite oxidizing bacteria was predominated by heterotrophic bacteria in the reactor at high c n feed condition soltani et al 1 reported the negligible 0 41 2 07 mg of no2 n l nitrite accumulation in batch reactor for 50 350 mg l of nh4 n concentration in the previous study it has been observed that ammonium removal inhibition occurs in the suspended biomass as well as immobilized biomass system when initial nh4 n concentration was high 200 mg l 31 to find a reason for sudden nh4 n removal dropped from low to high c n ratio 2 10 fa concentration of different influent nh4 n concentration were computed using the following expression proposed by ford et al 32 fa n h 4 n 1 0 ph exp 6334 273 t 10 ph where fa nh4 n and t are free ammonia concentration various nh4 n concentration used in this study 50 250 mg l and temperature c based on above equation fa concentration for various nh4 n concentration as 50 100 150 200 and 250 mg l were found to be 3 86 7 71 11 56 15 41 and 19 26 mg l respectively therefore decreasing removal of nh4 n at high c n ratio is may be due to increasing fa concentration as a result of increasing nh4 n concentration at constant temperature and ph fa inhibition threshold for ammonium oxidizer is 10 150 mg l and 0 1 4 0 mg l for nitrite oxidizer 13 as a result accumulation of nitrite can occur when fa level in the reactor is high in present case fa concentration exceeds 4 mg l at c n ratio 4 nitrite accumulation has been found with 100 mg l of nh4 n after that nitrification was inhibited with the corresponding decrease in the removal of nh4 n 33 fig 4 demonstrates the influence of nh4 n concentration over nitrate accumulation in nitrification reactor at influent nh4 n concentration of 50 mg l the nitrate was obtained as 0 99 mg no3 n l at 48 h rt the effluent nitrate n concentration increased to 2 99 mg l when cod ammonia ratio was 6 increase of effluent nitrate n concentration 4 71 mg l was observed at high c n ratio 10 8 with increase in influent nh4 n concentration as 100 150 200 and 250 mg l production of nitrate was observed as 2 99 3 87 4 7 and 5 98 mg no3 n l respectively at 48 h rt the obtained result reveals that efficiency of nitrification process is due to the availability of sufficient oxygen and electron acceptor 3 2 effect of c n ratio on cod removal cod removal at different c n ratio is given in fig 5 in order to maintain the different c n ratios 2 4 6 8 and 10 the influent cod concentration was increased from 100 to 2500 mg l when influent cod concentration was 100 mg l with c n ratio of 2 removal efficiency was 89 69 however when the c n ratio was maintained to 4 by keeping influent cod and nh4 n concentrations at 400 and 100 mg l the cod removal was obtained as 81 20 at 24 h rt that is further increased to 90 72 at 48 h rt lin et al 9 reported 83 7 of cod and 93 1 nh4 n removal at c n ratio of 5 the maximum removal efficiency of 98 67 was obtained with c n ratio of 10 at 48 h rt results indicate that more cod removal can be achieved at longer rt and with higher cod loading for present condition this might be due to microorganism get higher contact time to convert organic substrate to biomass to produce more energy yield 3 3 sem characterization of sponge cubes sem analysis is performed to examine the morphology of isolated microbial cells the sponge cubes were taken from each reactor and rinsed with diluted phosphate buffer solution they were dried by keeping in environmental condition overnight the particles were coated with gold and attached to the microscope support sem images were taken upto 5000 magnification under high vacuum condition fig 6 shows scanning electron microscopy sem images of sponge cubes before and after colonization of mixed microbial consortia observation of biosupport material using sem depicts the succession of densely colonized areas closer examination of the surface revealed the presence of dense biofilms embedded within a sponge and most colonies were observed to be large sized and cocci shaped 3 4 response

concentration of nh4 n respectively optimization of process parameters was conducted by rsm based on interactive model for maximum removal of nh4 n and cod the input parameters were given at specific ranges whereas response was designed to obtain maximum removal output the values of estimated coefficients are given in table 1 3 5 the interactive effect of operational parameters a three dimensional response surface is plotted based on interactive model equation to investigate the interaction effect of each operating parameter and also to determine the optimum values fig 7 a c illustrates the response of nh4 n removal corresponding to the interaction of rt c n ratio and influent nh4 n concentration similarly the interactive effects of rt c n ratio and influent cod on the cod removal are shown in the fig 8 a c the response surface plot shows the ranges of rt c n ratio influent nh4 n and influent cod affect correspondingly nh4 n and cod removal fig 7a and c shows nh4 n removal increases with increasing rt due to higher requirement of time by autotrophic microorganism to convert nh4 n to the intermediate products 1 fig 7 b shows the high removal of nh4 n obtained at low c n ratio as inhibition occurs at high concentration of nh4 n 5 fig 8a and c reveals that maximum removal of cod obtained at higher rt as 48 h similarly in fig 8b instructive effect of influent cod and c n gives the maximum possible removal of cod 94 in range of 100 1600 mg l after which no sudden changes was observed 2 analyzing the interactive plots the optimum values of process parameters for maximum removal of nh4 n were obtained at rt of 41 h and c n ratio of 2 the optimum values for cod removal was found as 41 h rt and c n ratio of 10 optimum removal of nh4 n and cod was obtained at c n of 4 at 41 h rt the optimized results presented are in a good agreement with the experimental results 3 6 validation of optimum parameters to validate the acquired optimum parameters by rsm an additional experiment was performed to confirm the nh4 n and cod removal efficiency the confirmatory experimental results reveal that 82 44 nh4 n and 87 12 cod removal occurred at optimum condition compared to 88 14 of nh4 n and 90 73 of cod removal obtained using interaction model this represents the suitability of chosen model 4 conclusion in this study effect of c n ratio on the simultaneous removal of cod and nh4 n was investigated by simultaneously varying the c n ratio influent cod concentration and nh4 n concentration the results revealed that the high percent removal of nh4 n was obtained at c n ratio of 2 with 48 h rt whereas 98 67 of cod removal achieved at high c n ratio of 10 at 48 h rt it can be concluded that c n ratio is an important factor for the maximum removal of cod and nh4 n the optimization of process parameters was performed by rsm and it can be applied for efficient operation of the wastewater treatment system acknowledgment authors would like to thank

n is converted to nitrite n by ammonium oxidizer and then to nitrate n by nitrite oxidizers in aerobic reactor effluent of nitrification reactor rich in nitrate n can be converted to n2 gas via denitrification process in an anoxic reactor by denitrifying bacteria and hereby completing the nitrogen cycle 5 8 1 a n h 4 a m m o n i u m o x i d i z e r n o 2 2 h h 2 o 1 b n o 2 1 5 o 2 n i t r i t e o x i d i z e r n o 3 the cod ammonia c n ratio which represents the relative amount of carbon and nitrogen source in the system can influence the nitrification and denitrification process as well as removal of cod simultaneously by microorganism it is reported that the c n ratio below 5 significantly affects the nitrification process and the removal of total nitrogen drops below 50 9 whereas a high c n ratio 7 30 provides corresponding high cod removal efficiency of around 92 due to the dominance of heterotrophic bacteria over the autotrophic bacteria 9 11 hence c n ratio is a crucial factor for the simultaneous removal of cod and nitrogen compounds from a nitrification reactor also both ammonium and nitrite oxidizers are sensitive to high concentration of their own substrates showing substrate inhibition another factor free ammonia fa can also inhibit both ammonium and nitrite oxidizer nitrite oxidizer nitrobacter is much more sensitive to fa even at 0 1 1 0 mg l than ammonium oxidizer nitrosomonas with 10 150 mg l 12 14 campos et al 15 reported that fa inhibition affects only ammonium oxidizer but not nitrite oxidizer therefore it is very necessary to maintain the level of fa in the reactor at its low concentration to avoid the inhibition to ammonium and nitrite oxidation 16 17 the effect of different operating parameters such as ph oxidation reduction potential c n ratio air flow rate reaction time and influent concentration on the nitrification performance are reported in various literatures 2 18 19 these operating parameters also influence the unit operation cost so that optimization is required to reduce the time and cost as well as to meet the dischargeable and good effluent quality through improvement of treatment system 4 18 many works have been reported for treatment of ammonia n and cod in wastewater using different types of bioreactors such as oxidation ditch sequencing batch reactor continuous stirred tank and biofilm airlift suspension reactor 19 22 however moving bed bioreactor mbbr is preferred due to its ease of handling and high efficiency for industrial wastewater treatment mbbr is an efficient attached growth process in which biofilm adhered to different carrier substance and move freely with the force of inlet or gas bubbles 23 mbbr possesses various advantages such as less space requirement compactness less dependent on biomass separation less sensitivity and better recovery during shock loadings due to the availability of the biofilm media with high specific surface area holding high amount of biomass 24 for optimization of process parameters response surface methodology rsm is reported as effective tool rsm is a collection of statistical and mathematical method used for the optimization of a particular process hasan et al 2 used rsm tool for optimization of cod load aeration rate and hrt to find removal performance of cod nh4 n and mn2 in this study effect of c n ratio on simultaneous removal of cod and nh4 n has been investigated by varying both cod and nh4 n concentration at the same time using aerobic mbbr rsm tool was used to evaluate the interaction effects of operating parameters on simultaneous removal of nh4 n and cod 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals all chemicals for feed composition as well as reagent preparation for various parameter analysis were of

added aerobic condition was maintained inside the reactor with the help of aeration pump connected with aeration stone the ph 7 5 0 5 was maintained inside the reactor by adding 0 1 n hcl nahco3 and the temperature were maintained at 30 2 0 c the schematic diagram of experimental setup is shown in fig 1 acclimatization was conducted for 30 days until the steady state condition was achieved 2 3 serum bottle reactor startup and operation after acclimatization in attached growth aerobic batch reactor serum bottle reactors ideal to the original reactor were started with 50 ml capacity 0 4 g sponge cubes 20 sponges were added in serum bottle reactor which was 40 volume of the reactor these mini reactors were operated at similar conditions to its original source batch reactor to investigate the performance of different c n ratio on the simultaneous removal of cod and nh4 n in the present study c n ratio was varied from 2 to 10 by and changing the concentration of cod and nh4 n towards higher end such as cod nh4 n 100 50 to 2500 250 while both the contents were simultaneously increased 2 4 analytical methods the removal efficiency was determined by analyzing the samples taken from feed influent sample and samples taken from reactor after 24 and 48 h of reaction time rt the samples were centrifuged at 2000 rpm remi rm 12c bl india for 20 min prior analysis according to standard methods 25 cod was estimated by closed reflux titrimetric method cod analysis was performed using cod vials of 10 ml capacity initially 1 5 ml digestion solution k2cr2o7 reagent and 3 5 ml sulfuric acid reagent was added then 2 5 ml of sample was added and vials were inverted several times to mix solution completely afterwards vials were placed in the preheated digester spectroquant tr 320 merck germany at 148 2 c for 2 h after digestion samples were cooled to room temperature and titrate against 0 1 m ferrous ammonium sulfate fas titrant in presence of ferroin indicator nh4 n concentration was measured by phenate method in this method standards of known concentration of nh4 n was prepared and absorbance has taken in uv spectrophotometer uv 1800 shimadzu japan against blank solution at 640 nm thereafter samples absorbance are taken and compared with calibration curve similarly no3 n concentration was determined by an ultraviolet screening method at wavelength of 220 and 275 nm nitrite was measured using colorimetric method at 543 nm using the uv spectrophotometer 2 5 microscopic analysis scanning electron microscopy sem analysis was conducted to determine structural morphology of the microorganisms attached to the supporting biofilm sponge this analysis was performed by zeiss evo series scanning electron microscope evo18 samples were gold coated and sem images were taken at various magnifications 2 6 experimental design the effect of c n ratio on nh4 n and cod removal was analyzed in serum bottle reactor by simultaneously varying the influent concentration of nh4 n and cod optimization of each operating parameters such as rt c n ratio influent cod and influent nh4 n was done using rsm tool in matlab 7 9 rsm model design can be described by interaction model using the following eq 1 1 z β1 β2 p β3 q β4 r β5 p q β6 q r β7 r p where z is the response β1 β2 β3 β4 β5 β6 β7 are the interaction coefficients and p q and r are process parameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of c n ratio on nh4 n no2 n and no3 n removal in mbbr the influent nh4 n concentration was varied as 50 100 150 200 and 250 mg l and simultaneously varying the influent cod concentration 100 400 900 1600 and 2500 mg l to provide c n ratio of 2 4 6 8 and 10 fig 2 shows the removal of nh4 n under different c n ratio after the acclimation period when c n ratio was low c n 2 83 60 removal of nh4 n was obtained within 24 h the maximum removal of nh4 n 99 14 was observed at 48 h with a c n ratio of 2 soltani et al 1 reported 97 2 removal efficiency with an initial nh4 n concentration of 50 mg l with increasing c n ratio from 2 to 8 ammonia removal decreased gradually to 80 whereas a further increase of c n to 10 the removal efficiency decreased to 60 during this experimental period a sudden increase in the ph 9 9 5 was observed the increase in ph is might be due to the accumulation of nh4oh because nh4cl concentration was increased from 100 to 250 mg l to provide c n ratio of 2 10 chen et al 26 investigated the removal performance of cod and nh4 n in mbbr using novel suspended carrier by coating sponge on inside and outside of a hard polyethylene ring high removal rate of cod 99 5 1 1 and nh4 n 93 6 2 3 has been reported compare to commercial carrier 74 9 2 7 and 40 0 1 8 27 28 shammas et al 29 reported that optimum ph for nitrification is 8 4 and maximum rate of nitrification occurs between 7 8 and 8 9 in this study efficient nitrification occurs at low c n ratio might be due absence of substrate inhibition and possibility of dominance of nitrifying bacteria however when the influent nh4 n concentration increases nitrification drops with decrease in removal of nh4 n this might be due to accumulation of nh4oh resulting in the increase of alkalinity and the consumption of co2 by autotrophic microorganism for their growth the higher ammonia removal at low c n ratio fig 2 is due to dominance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria whereas at higher c n ratio the heterotrophic bacteria dominate the biomass resulting in lower preference to nh4 n consumption 30 the significant drop in nh4 n removal efficiency at high cod ammonia ratio of 10 has been reported by lin et al 9 nitrite is intermediate product of nh4 n oxidation to nitrate in the nitrification reactor by autotrophic microorganisms fig 3 depicts the nitrite accumulation at influent concentrations 50 250 mg l of nh4 n at 48 h of reactor operation with various c n ratios nitrite accumulation increased from 0 59 to 1 99 mg l with the increase of nh4 n concentration from 50 to 250 mg l the increase in nitrite accumulation with increasing c n ratio indicates that nitrite oxidizing bacteria was predominated by heterotrophic bacteria in the reactor at high c n feed condition soltani et al 1 reported the negligible 0 41 2 07 mg of no2 n l nitrite accumulation in batch reactor for 50 350 mg l of nh4 n concentration in the previous study it has been observed that ammonium removal inhibition occurs in the suspended biomass as well as immobilized biomass system when initial nh4 n concentration was high 200 mg l 31 to find a reason for sudden nh4 n removal dropped from low to high c n ratio 2 10 fa concentration of different influent nh4 n concentration were computed using the following expression proposed by ford et al 32 fa n h 4 n 1 0 ph exp 6334 273 t 10 ph where fa nh4 n and t are free ammonia concentration various nh4 n concentration used in this study 50 250 mg l and temperature c based on above equation fa concentration for various nh4 n concentration as 50 100 150 200 and 250 mg l were found to be 3 86 7 71 11 56 15 41 and 19 26 mg l respectively therefore decreasing removal of nh4 n at high c n ratio is may be due to increasing fa concentration as a result of increasing nh4 n concentration at constant temperature and ph fa inhibition threshold for ammonium oxidizer is 10 150 mg l and 0 1 4 0 mg l for nitrite oxidizer 13 as a result accumulation of nitrite can occur when fa level in the reactor is high in present case fa concentration exceeds 4 mg l at c n ratio 4 nitrite accumulation has been found with 100 mg l of nh4 n after that nitrification was inhibited with the corresponding decrease in the removal of nh4 n 33 fig 4 demonstrates the influence of nh4 n concentration over nitrate accumulation in nitrification reactor at influent nh4 n concentration of 50 mg l the nitrate was obtained as 0 99 mg no3 n l at 48 h rt the effluent nitrate n concentration increased to 2 99 mg l when cod ammonia ratio was 6 increase of effluent nitrate n concentration 4 71 mg l was observed at high c n ratio 10 8 with increase in influent nh4 n concentration as 100 150 200 and 250 mg l production of nitrate was observed as 2 99 3 87 4 7 and 5 98 mg no3 n l respectively at 48 h rt the obtained result reveals that efficiency of nitrification process is due to the availability of sufficient oxygen and electron acceptor 3 2 effect of c n ratio on cod removal cod removal at different c n ratio is given in fig 5 in order to maintain the different c n ratios 2 4 6 8 and 10 the influent cod concentration was increased from 100 to 2500 mg l when influent cod concentration was 100 mg l with c n ratio of 2 removal efficiency was 89 69 however when the c n ratio was maintained to 4 by keeping influent cod and nh4 n concentrations at 400 and 100 mg l the cod removal was obtained as 81 20 at 24 h rt that is further increased to 90 72 at 48 h rt lin et al 9 reported 83 7 of cod and 93 1 nh4 n removal at c n ratio of 5 the maximum removal efficiency of 98 67 was obtained with c n ratio of 10 at 48 h rt results indicate that more cod removal can be achieved at longer rt and with higher cod loading for present condition this might be due to microorganism get higher contact time to convert organic substrate to biomass to produce more energy yield 3 3 sem characterization of sponge cubes sem analysis is performed to examine the morphology of isolated microbial cells the sponge cubes were taken from each reactor and rinsed with diluted phosphate buffer solution they were dried by keeping in environmental condition overnight the particles were coated with gold and attached to the microscope support sem images were taken upto 5000 magnification under high vacuum condition fig 6 shows scanning electron microscopy sem images of sponge cubes before and after colonization of mixed microbial consortia observation of biosupport material using sem depicts the succession of densely colonized areas closer examination of the surface revealed the presence of dense biofilms embedded within a sponge and most colonies were observed to be large sized and cocci shaped 3 4 response surface analysis the experimental parameters are evaluated by the rsm tool using the interaction model to establish the relationship between the process parameters eq 2 describes the interaction model 2 z 69 3937 0 5643p 11 6146q 2 0579r 0 2163pq 0 0139qr 0 0903rp where z is the response in terms of nh4 n removal whereas p q and r corresponds to independent parameters of rt c n ratio and influent concentration of nh4 n respectively optimization of process parameters was conducted by rsm based on interactive model for maximum removal of nh4 n and cod the input parameters were given at specific ranges whereas response was designed to obtain maximum removal output the values of estimated coefficients are given in table 1 3 5 the interactive effect of operational parameters a three dimensional response surface is plotted based on interactive model equation to investigate the interaction effect of each operating parameter and also to determine the optimum values fig 7 a c illustrates the response of nh4 n removal corresponding to the interaction of rt c n ratio and influent nh4 n concentration similarly the interactive effects of rt c n ratio and influent cod on the cod removal are shown in the fig 8 a c the response surface plot shows the ranges of rt c n ratio influent nh4 n and influent cod affect correspondingly nh4 n and cod removal fig 7a and c shows nh4 n removal increases with increasing rt due to higher requirement of time by autotrophic microorganism to convert nh4 n to the intermediate products 1 fig 7 b shows the high removal of nh4 n obtained at low c n ratio as inhibition occurs at high concentration of nh4 n 5 fig 8a and c reveals that maximum removal of cod obtained at higher rt as 48 h similarly in fig 8b instructive effect of influent cod and c n gives the maximum possible removal of cod 94 in range of 100 1600 mg l after which no sudden changes was observed 2 analyzing the interactive plots the optimum values of process parameters for maximum removal of nh4 n were obtained at rt of 41 h and c n ratio of 2 the optimum values for cod removal was found as 41 h rt and c n ratio of 10 optimum removal of nh4 n and cod was obtained at c n of 4 at 41 h rt the optimized results presented are in a good agreement with the experimental results 3 6 validation of optimum parameters to validate the acquired optimum parameters by rsm an additional experiment was performed to confirm the nh4 n and cod removal efficiency the confirmatory experimental results reveal that 82 44 nh4 n and 87 12 cod removal occurred at optimum condition compared to 88 14 of nh4 n and 90 73 of cod removal obtained using interaction model this represents the suitability of chosen model 4 conclusion in this study effect of c n ratio on the simultaneous removal of cod and nh4 n was investigated by simultaneously varying the c n ratio influent cod concentration and nh4 n concentration the results revealed that the high percent removal of nh4 n was obtained at c n ratio of 2 with 48 h rt whereas 98 67 of cod removal achieved at high c n ratio of 10 at 48 h rt it can be concluded that c n ratio is an important factor for the maximum removal of cod and nh4 n the optimization of process parameters was performed by rsm and it can be applied for efficient operation of the wastewater treatment system acknowledgment authors would like to thank
