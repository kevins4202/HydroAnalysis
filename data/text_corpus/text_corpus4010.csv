20050,emerging chemical substances have dramatically increased in aquatic ecosystems throughout the last few decades and are creating harmful effects on sustainable environments herbicides and antibiotics are usually consumed simultaneously and liquidated into the aquatic system as effluents due to the dearth of rigorous control of emerging substances it poses a threat to ecotoxicologists and limnologists because of their hidden roles against non target aquatic organisms like zooplankton these substances have a negative impact on grazer inducers and disrupt community level zooplankton phytoplankton relationships but the hidden role of these phenomena due to these substances is still clearly unknown so the present mesocosm study summarises and updates the current status of antibiotics and herbicides on the survival of zooplankton species we also discuss the role of various herbicides and antibiotics on these non targeted organisms and create baseline information to overcome the above mentioned risks and expand the scope of future research in this field keywords herbicide antibiotics zooplankton aquatic ecosystem environment introduction in recent years uses of agrochemical substances such as antibiotics and herbicides in aquaculture ecosystems have increased day by day through surface runoff kelly and cohen 2018 though various compounds of these are more toxic to aquatic zooplankton and phytoplankton the efficacy of just one agrochemical substance is studied at a time kelly 2018 generally to control the diversity of weeds in agricultural systems we use herbicides unfortunately the excessive use of these compounds may have created negative impacts on nontargeted organisms in sustainable ecosystems sarma et al 2001 nwani et al 2010 a long history of various herbicide compounds in aquatic systems has produced adverse effects on zooplankton diversity zooplankton populations which are widespread in freshwater and marine ecosystems are populated in aquatic ecosystems around the globe and have their density as an indispensable component of food webs in aquatic systems lomartire et al 2021 midya et al 2018 according to the millennium ecosystem assessment in 2005 ecosystem services are broadly classified into four categories i e regulating provisioning supporting and cultural services it was established that the presence of zooplankton in aquatic systems affects the dynamics of the aquatic ecosystem and that the perpendicular migration patterns of the zooplankton population have too much impact on fish migration rates as well as acting as a grazer for bacteria and algae and influencing their population communities bruce et al 2006 sterner 2009 thus the gradual increase in primary productivity in aquatic systems may have key effects on the eutrophication of the waterbodies which creates stress in aquatic communities i e the zooplankton population dounas et al 2007 zooplankton play an important role in nutrient recycling they provide phytoplankton with phosphorus and nitrogen help in the biological carbon pump which regulates the co2 level in the atmosphere sterner 2009 kwon et al 2009 the zooplankton community has a strong effect on the biomass stocks of other various planktonic groups it has also altered the concentration of prey and predator populations with consequent effects on fish biomass in aquaculture vanni 2002 zooplankton population communities are used as indicators for environmental conditions which alter the status of ecosystems like living flora and fauna and pass on information to us about predators like fish and their abundance sherman et al 2002 zooplankton populations are used as a live feed for various farmed fish in aquatic environments the quality of the feed has direct and indirect effects on growth and mortality respectively in fish and is cost effective midya and islam 2022 so at present it is possible to reduce that cost by finding alternative ways to utilise the aquatic live feed in aquaculture traditional live feeds are copepods brine shrimp i e artemia spp and rotifers i e brachionus spp which also help in the survival growth rate and development of various types of fish larvae hansen 2017 the presence of herbicides in waterbodies can alter the species interaction phenomena in waterbodies but till now it is unknown how the antibiotics influence the responses after addition with herbicides in aquatic ecosystems antibiotics enter via different ways such as leakage from septic tanks wastewater runoff from treatment plants manufacturing emissions and runoff from topical livestock treatment fuhrer 1999 at present aquaculture plays an important role in the livelihood of fishery farmers and is a major source of animal protein over forty percent of the global population consumes 17 animal protein from aquatic animals with fish contributing 20 of per capita animal protein fao 2018 globally intensive animal production is increasing simultaneously due to the high demand for proteinaceous nutritional sources so prominence is placed on high production rates which precede the adoption of farm hygiene biosecurity and standards management systems steinfeld et al 2006 schar et al 2020 in this milieu to protect and disease free the cultured fish farmers use different kinds of antibiotics for their sustainable livelihood tetracycline a frequently used antibiotic has a high potential to be mixed with surface waterbodies near agricultural fields industrial sites or by direct implementation into an aqua eco system boxall et al 2003 the functional target of tetracycline is the bacterial ribosome and chloroplast ribosome of aquatic primary producers by preventing protein synthesis chopra and roberts 2001 yang et al 2013 tetracycline inhibits the photosynthesis systems in cyanobacteria viz microcystis aeruginosa and also in green microalgae viz selenastrum capricornutum at 100 µg l concentration inhibit the growth of an aquatic microphyte viz lemna minor at 1000 µg l concentration yang et al 2013 pomati et al 2004 previous study suggests that various antibiotics such as amoxicillin aminosidine bacitracin ciprofloxacin erythromycin ibuprofen lincomycin metronidazole norfloxacin neomycin sulfate oxolinic acid oxytetracycline penicillin g sulfadiazine sulfomethoxazole streptomycin streptomycin sulfate tetracycline tylosin trimethoprim and tiamulin actively inhibit the growth of crustacean zooplankton like as acartia tonsa brachionus plicatilis brachionus calyciflorus brachionus havanaensis daphnia magna and nitocra spinipes by alter the various physiological properties kelly 2018 wollenberger et al 2000 edlund et al 2012 zalewski et al 2011 kim et al 2012 agostini et al 2016 gonzalez perez et al 2016 pan et al 2017 wang et al 2017 till date how the whole herbicide or antibiotic effect on non targeted aquatic organisms is totally unknown however very little has been recorded in this vein till date in particular the present study tries to summarise a compact knowledge of the toxic and harmful effects of various herbicides and antibiotics on non targeted aquatic organisms which needs to find out the information and evidence on possible alteration of the biotic community in aqua eco system zooplankton growth regulated by antibiotics since the 1940s globally antibiotics have been widely used in veterinary medicine and in human beings hvistendahl 2012 antibiotics were entering aquatic ecosystems via discharge as industrial effluents manure spreading septic tank leaks and direct uses in aquaculture sources of antibiotic compounds and their deposition in aqua ecosystems and how they are transferred in waterbodies from primary producers to tertiary consumers are shown in fig 1 now a days intensive farming processes are considered to concentrate the higher number of animal diversity in a specified location which implies the use of feed additives or drugs which include antibiotics furans imidazoles quinoxaline derivates and sulphonamides for mass therapy shim et al 2022 out of them at present antibiotics are the most commonly used mass therapy and feed additive agents which are found in animal waste and have significant functional activity and toxicity efficacy midya et al 2019 rotifers mainly species of brachionus are a dominant cluster group of zooplankton which have been widely used in aqua ecosystem for risk assessments of different chemical substances and their derivatives because of their excessive sensitivity and high reproductive rates pan et al 2017 nguyen et al 2022 to date very little has been published in this vein regarding the toxic activity of antibiotics on aquatic creatures like zooplankton persistence of herbicides in water bodies differs based on their chemical nature such as dalapon which persists in water for 2 3 days 2 4 d amine which persists in water for up to 4 6 weeks diuron and terbutryne which persist for more than 3 months whereas dichlobenil stays in water for up to 3 months newbold 1975 the most commonly used herbicide in rural agricultural fields is atrazine water solubility 32 mg l and 30 day hydrolysis half life which is easily leached and dispersed and mostly detected in groundwater reservoirs rivers streams and pond ecosystems nwani et al 2010 battaglin et al 2008 atrazine hampers the aquatic animal in various ways such as inhibiting photosynthesis in macrophytes by altering the electron transport systems of photosystem ii inhibiting the growth of primary producers reducing the biomass of planktonic crustaceans like daphnia magna daphnia pulex daphnia macrocopa and ceriodaphnia dubia and having effects on species interaction and aquatic floating plants kelly 2018 graymore et al 2001 various researchers worked on tetracycline s efficacy at 0 1 and 0 5 mg l concentrations towards model organisms like daphnia magna which effects on reproduction and abundance 30 and 60 growth rate decrease respectively of that organism kim et al 2012 whereas population growth rate was decreased with the same antibiotics at 29 4 mg l concentrations after exposure for 21 days wollenberger et al 2000 on the other hand the same antibiotics at 1 μg l concentration alone decreased the growth rate of the same microscopic crustacean kelly 2018 zooplankton behaviour heartbeat rate and feeding efficiency were decreased by acute norfloxacin antibiotic contamination and also compromised the aquatic ecosystem s health pan et al 2017 seven fluoroquinolones grouped ciprofloxacin clinafloxacin enrofloxacin flumequine levofloxacin lomefloxacin and ofloxacin of antibiotics were used to conduct toxicity tests on crustaceans populations such as daphnia magna results from the test showed a 10 mortality rate at 10 mg l concentration of such antibiotics on daphnia magna after 48 h survival robinson et al 2005 researchers reported on crustacean rotifers such as brachionus plicatilis in an ecotoxicological perspective and with ciprofloxacin hydrochlorides efficacy at more than 2 0 mg l higher concentration the density of said rotifers was decreased wang et al 2017 table 1 mechanism of action of antibiotics towards the zooplankton species over the past eras the rate of antibiotic residue deposition has increased in river and lake ecosystems in various ways zooplankton communities are widely used in different investigations to determine the acute or chronic toxicity effects of antibiotics in aquatic eco systems pan et al 2017 through the predator prey relationship zooplankton serves as an intermediate trophic organism between the communities of bacteria algae insects and fish some recent investigations reported that antibiotic residues affect the survival rate of the zooplankton individuals by inducing genotoxicity swimming behaviour cardiac dysfunction and oxidative stress responses guo et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 the trimethoprim antibiotic shows the greatest toxicity towards d magna followed by oxytetracycline and erythromycin sublethal efficacy on physio bio chemistry against the non targeted organism s zooplankton shows the varied impact previous investigation reported that the antibiotic lomefloxacin is causing oxidative stress in daphnia sp and inducing cellular damage luo et al 2018 formation of reactive oxygen species ros is a widely accepted mechanism by which various antibiotics have an effect on membrane lipids nucleic acids and proteins which change the physio bio chemical properties of the non targeted organism s and cause death phenomena zhang et al 2021 dionisio et al 2020 different antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase cat and sod regulate the overall ros level for example d magna species possess the mn sod and zn cu sod activities which function on the conversion of superoxide anions to hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and oxygen o2 molecules during the exposure of antibiotic substances the cat enzyme activity increases in daphnia sp which catalyses the degradation of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen dionisio et al 2020 exposure to the antibiotic oxytetracycline in pseudocohnilembus persalinus increases the glutathione peroxidase level which regulates metabolic activity with an antioxidant defence mechanism wang et al 2017 on the other hand exposure to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin increases the reactive substances of thiobarbituric acid in d magna which indicates the antioxidant defence dionisio et al 2020 transportation and exposer of antibiotic substances from open environment to aquatic systems and their effective function on aquatic zooplankton species were shown through graphical reorientation in fig 2 in cladoceran grazers heart rate is an indicator of physiological injury which is functionally sensitive to antibiotic substances dejected cardiac action may be the outcome of neurotoxicity which blocks sodium na channels in cardiac neurons or antibiotic induced oxidative stress as a result of which the supply of oxygen to organs is reduced dionisio et al 2020 bownik et al 2019 previous investigation implies that norfloxacin decreases the heart rate of d magna therefore harshly damaging the cardiac function pan et al 2017 a recent investigation showed that an increasing rate of norfloxacin antibiotic concentration decreased the hopping frequency of zooplankton species thus decreasing the swimming ability of the non targeted zooplankton species previous investigation also supported the fact that acetylcholinesterase mrna expression and acetylcholinesterase activity are both inhibited by the antibiotic substances in rotifers kim et al 2012 the thoracic limb activity of individuals daphnia sp and their turning ability have been reduced by the exposure to procaine penicillin which targeted motor neurons and inhibited their function gunathilaka et al 2023 on the other hand in simocephalus vetulus gatifloxacin antibiotic exposure functionally decreases thoracic limb rate nguyen et al 2022 zooplankton growth regulated by herbicides the dynamics of zooplankton populations in aquatic ecosystems were continuously influenced by the use of herbicides either directly or indirectly atrazine acroleine diuron fluazifop p butyl glyphosate metribuzin triasulfuron triclopyr etc sarma et al 2009 an herbicide affects zooplankton diversity when reproduction and growth are taking place due to oxygenic stress triasulphuron a routinely used herbicide in rice and wheat fields which also persists up to 24 months in soil and leaches to the water column in aquatic systems where it effects on reproduction and survival of zooplankton i e in d magna at a lethal concentration level of 48 mg l also showed growth regulatory action against brachionus patulus rotifer at 120 µg ml sarma et al 2009 vulliet et al 2004 atrazine is used to control weeds but has adverse effects on various nontargeted aquatic animals like macrophytes and microalgae in waterbodies graymore et al 2001 this herbicide reduces the food availability in aquatic systems and also diminishes the reproduction rate of crustacean animals decreasing the abundance and biomass of daphnia magna at 50 µg l after exposure for 21 days kelly 2018 lampert et al 1989 propanil a phenylamide class of herbicide is sprayed to control echinochloa crusgalli barnyard grass postemergent treatment of oryza sativa rice plant and broadleaf weeds in an agro ecosystem after being leached into the waterbodies it arrested the growth survival and reproduction rates of daphnia magna organisms at a 0 08 mg l concentration of propanil herbicide the propanil metabolite 3 4 dca showed acute lethal inhibition of the reproduction rate in d magna moore et al 1998 villarroel et al 2003 glyphosate known as roundup a widely used herbicide around the globe is hailed as the most important herbicide ever developed but the increasing scenario of this herbicide s effects on nontarget animals and indirect impacts on small mammals and various bird families deepananda et al 2011 recommended doses of roundup in agricultural fields pose an ecological risk to native crustaceans daphnia carinata of australia as well as shrimp parataya australiensis and crayfish cherax destructor of freshwater ecosystems deepananda et al 2011 nugegoda et al 2002 it was established that the static bioassay of roundup showed the lc50 values at 48 h against the crustaceans phyllodiaptomus annae at 1 059 mg l 0 985 1 134 concentration in sri lanka gradually increasing evidence of roundup is showing highly toxic effects depending on intensity of exposure frequency and time duration as well as being susceptible to target or non targeted organisms landis and yu 1985 triclopyr known as release commercially used as an herbicide impacts the suppression of varied types of broad leaved plants in the vegetation management field at us and canadian forests and other countries also shepard et al 2004 in the field experiment it was found that the mortality rate of simocephalus vetulus was increasing significantly at 0 5 mg l herbicide concentration chen et al 2008 2 4 d an important herbicide that protects the crop in an agro ecosystem leaches into the waterbodies and functions on non target aquatic organisms has a negative influence and inhibits the population growth of brachionus patulus crustacean rotifer at 500 mg l concentration beyond the 5 days sarma et al 2001 the mixture of commercial products of 2 4 d known as bartt and glyphosate known as roundup togetherly hampers and reduces the biomass and abundance of rotifer a diversified and abundant group of invertebrates in aquatic ecosystem portinho et al 2018 primextra gold zt is mostly used herbicide in portugal among the best 20

methylthiotriazine herbicide mainly performs as a growth regulator of zooplankton community i e rotifers and cladocerans population chang et al 2008 fluazifop p butyl a commercial used herbicide has the acute toxic impacts on zooplankton crustacean s species daphnia magna shows the lethal acute toxicity effects at 48 h lc50 4 63 mg l azgn and goksu 2016 triasulphuron is a routinely used herbicide in rice and wheat cultivation field to control the weeds where it also effects on reproduction and survival fitness of zooplankton brachionus patulus a crustacean s rotifer sensitive towards the triasulphuron herbicide at concentration level of 120 µg ml sarma et al 2009 herbicides play a key role in aquatic water bodies by controlling the growth patterns and reproduction rate which directly impacts on population dynamics of crustacean s zooplankton species lethal and sublethal effects of various herbicide have been observed in various groups of crustacean s zooplankton such as rotifers malacostracans copepods cladocerans and amphipods table 2 leaching of herbicide compounds from open environment and industrial sides into the aquatic systems and their transferring approaches from primary producer zooplankton to tertiary consumers fish of aqua systems represent in fig 3 mechanism of action of herbicides towards the zooplankton species differently categorised herbicides are introduced to the aquatic ecosystem by run off spray drift accidental spills and leaching different studies revealed that herbicides have direct effects on the primary producers of an ecosystem and decrease the abundance of consumers at a bottom up level because of food limitations fleeger et al 2003 the functions of herbicides from different groups are summarised below with examples 1 amino acid synthesis blocker glyphosate an important herbicide and exclusively used in aqua system martin and chu 2003 observed the toxicity levels of isopropylamine ipa glyphosate acid and polyoxyethylene amine poea in microtox crustaceans acartia tonsa and ceriodaphnia dubia the results showed that the toxicity order was as follows ipa glyphosate acid roundup poea glyphosate plays a crucial affect during the development of embryonic stage reproductive periods average lifespan and juvenile time as well as in the population s increasing rate of rotifers i e in brachionus calyciflorus in acartia tonsa and ceriodaphnia dubia the lc50 35 3 and 147 mg l to glyphosate acid respectively chu et al 2005 2 cell membrane disruption paraquat interferes with cellular transport and induces polyamines putrescine spermine and spermidine resulting in the initiation of oxidative stress i e enzymatic activities of sod cat and lipoperoxidation cochon et al 2007 paraquat is showing its toxicity towards all plankton communities including zooplankton such as copepods mesocyclops spp and thermocyclops decipiens cladocerans diaphanosoma excisum and rotifers asplanchna spp brachionus calyciflorus conochiloide spp hexarthra spp and lecane sp leading to reduce biomass abundance and trophic functioning leboulanger et al 2011 another herbicide molinate significantly decrease the reproduction rate of daphnia magna with increasing the concentration of herbicide in the medium and it s have not any effect on first to third offspring population rather than the parental population sanchez et al 2004 3 growth regulators 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid a growth regulatory herbicide that effects invertebrates rotifers and crustaceans number per litre of water with a different concentration of herbicide i e 10 kg ha and 5 kg ha sarma et al 2001 4 lipid synthesis inhibitors metazachlor and norflurazon are lipid synthesis blockers frequently used herbicides that have effects on zooplankton species such as acropercus harpae lecane spp alonella excisa brachionus calyciflorus bosmia longirostris ceriodaphnia quadrangular chydorus sphaericus keratella quadrata and polyathra dolicoptera mohr et al 2008 horvat et al 2005 table 3 conclusion and future direction the study of these fields and the adverse effects of antibiotics and herbicides on aquatic nontargeted organisms like crustacean s zooplankton is an unexplored area studies in quantitative and qualitative research and their species specific relationships are truly scarce or missing in the vein of scientific literature ecotoxicogenomics studies regarding this are scarce and very much restricted to a few antibiotics and herbicides for a few species like acartia tonsa brachionus plicatilis brachionus calyciflorus brachionus havanaensis daphnia magna and nitocra spinipes regarding this biomarker applied to antibiotic and herbicide exposure very few data sets are available to suggest that the potential of antibiotics and herbicides for producing ecotoxicological effects on crustacean zooplankton can be high and warrants future research thus the presence of an antibiotic or herbicide alone can change species specific interactions in aquatic communities but how the addition of both substances might influence these responses is still unknown so it warrants future research the time specific exposure of herbicides and antibiotics and their lethal and sublethal doses against crustacean zooplankton is still unknown so it warrants future research work the above doubts can be overcome by using well planned experiments that focus on immune and endocrine function in a dose dependent manner these mesocosm studies can help identify and characterise the mechanisms that modify the sensitivity of crustaceans zooplankton to exposure to antibiotics or herbicides in conclusion further research in this hitherto unexplored study area would be necessary to assess the eco aquatic environment and environmental risk associated with zootechnical farming and improve the aquatic ecosystem author contribution both authors sk saruk islam and sujoy midya are participated fully to prepared this

decreasing the swimming ability of the non targeted zooplankton species previous investigation also supported the fact that acetylcholinesterase mrna expression and acetylcholinesterase activity are both inhibited by the antibiotic substances in rotifers kim et al 2012 the thoracic limb activity of individuals daphnia sp and their turning ability have been reduced by the exposure to procaine

et al 2008 horvat et al 2005 table 3 conclusion and future direction the study of these fields and the adverse effects of antibiotics and herbicides on aquatic nontargeted organisms like crustacean s zooplankton is an unexplored area studies in quantitative and qualitative research and their species specific relationships are truly scarce or missing in the vein of scientific literature ecotoxicogenomics studies regarding this are scarce and very much restricted to a few antibiotics and herbicides for a few species like acartia tonsa brachionus plicatilis brachionus calyciflorus brachionus havanaensis daphnia magna and nitocra spinipes regarding this biomarker applied to antibiotic and herbicide exposure very few data sets are available to suggest that the potential of antibiotics and herbicides for producing ecotoxicological effects on crustacean zooplankton can be high and warrants future research thus the presence of an antibiotic or herbicide alone can change species specific interactions in aquatic communities but how the addition of both substances might influence these responses is still unknown so it warrants future research the time specific exposure of herbicides and antibiotics and their lethal and sublethal doses against crustacean zooplankton is still unknown so it warrants future research work the above doubts can be overcome by using well planned experiments that focus on immune and endocrine function in a dose dependent manner these mesocosm studies can help identify and characterise the mechanisms that modify the sensitivity of crustaceans zooplankton to exposure to antibiotics or herbicides in conclusion further research in this hitherto unexplored study area would be necessary to assess the eco aquatic environment and environmental risk associated with zootechnical farming and improve the aquatic ecosystem author contribution both authors sk saruk islam and sujoy midya are participated fully to prepared this

20051,the kenyan lake victoria basin has been experiencing land degradation and overexploitation as seen in various landscape changes quantifying and understanding the nature of these changes is essential for management decision making this study sought to apply the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi normalized difference water index ndwi and normalized difference built up index ndbi enhanced normalized difference built up index ndbi endbi indices to assess the changes in vegetation water bodies and build up area respectively in the basin between 1978 and 2018 landsat imageries for 1978 1988 1998 2008 and 2018 with thematic oriented bands were acquired pre processed and subjected to spectral based classification techniques in arcgis software to compute and generate ndvi ndwi and ndbi endbi maps according to the results ndvi indicated an intense decreasing trend in the density of vegetated landscapes while ndvi ndwi and ndbi all depicted fluctuations in moisture content in lake victoria and its wetlands the ndbi endbi showed an intense increasing trend in the built up area expansion based on these changes the study concluded that urban development has been rapidly progressing within the lake victoria basin over the years intensive and strategic planning that strikes a balance between economic development and environmental conservation is recommended to realize the sustainability of this important watershed keywords lake victoria basin remote sensing change detection multi spectral indices 1 introduction the earth s surface is continually transforming due to several factors many of which are anthropogenic induced chu et al 2009 only a few landscapes around the world are still in their natural state ayele et al 2018 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2019 reported that over 70 of the world s land surface has been directly impacted by anthropogenic utilization land use and land cover change lulc which in most cases involve converting naturally existing landscapes into agricultural land or build up areas for residential or commercial purposes when left uncontrolled often results in serious environmental degradation issues including disasters and food insecurity unep 2016 ipcc 2019 understanding the trends causes and consequences of these changes can be aided by mapping and visualizing them hesping 2020 monitoring and analysis of lulc changes have become a distinct area of scientific study with applications in both the public and private sectors hesping 2020 remote sensing which refers to the gathering of geospatial information from space or the air willis 2015 is a powerful tool that has been applied by numerous researchers in detecting classifying and monitoring land use and land cover changes demir et al 2012 salmon et al 2013 this is due to its benefits over traditional ground based surveys which can be time consuming labor intensive and costly willis 2015 the capabilities of remote sensing include availing consistent accurate and suitable observations on the distribution pattern of lulc over an expanse geographical area rogan chen 2004 dezso et al 2005 willis 2015 mapping and analyzing lulc changes through remote sensing follows land cover classification and change detection methodologies change detection is one of the most popular applications of remote sensing analysis of landscape transformation processes and refers to the process of comparing the differences in the features of a particular area or phenomenon over two or more temporal epochs hussain et al 2013 it s a process in which two lulc images observed at different times are classified separately and the results of the two classifications are compared lillesand et al 2015 for an effective change detection analysis a period of at least ten years is needed with data being collected every 2 years to account for rapid changes huang et al 2009 change detection generally entails analyzing the temporal dynamics of a phenomenon quantitatively using multi temporal datasets lu et al 2004 the multi temporal data sets are records of conditions at different places over different epochs of time available in images that have been captured and stored by satellites bhatta 2010 in change detection research the vast and otherwise obscured information in multispectral images can be extracted through various image processing techniques viz spectral mixture analysis wu murray 2003 wu 2009 gong et al 2018 machine learning based classification oommen et al 2008 lary et al 2016 maxwell warner fang 2018 artificial neural networks ann mas flores 2008 singha bellerby trieschmann 2013 şenkal 2010 spectral unmixing based methods plaza et al 2011 dópido et al 2012 zhong et al 2016 among others spectral index based approaches are the most common and widely used of these techniques since they are easy to perform and produce reliable results bijeesh narasimhamurthy 2019 they are developed by mixing data from multiple bands of a multispectral image to improve the accuracy of delineation polykretis grillakis alexakis 2020 several multi spectral indices have been developed to map features on the earth s surface basing on the different biases in reflectivity of the features at various portions of the electromagnetic spectrum polykretis et al 2020 the absorption of the red light by chlorophyll and strong reflectance of infrared radiation by the mesophyll provides the accurate inverse relationship that is used to generate several vegetation ratios for mapping campbell wynne 2011 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is the most widely used vegetation index it is preferred to simple index because it helps compensate for changing illumination conditions slope aspect and other factors lillesand et al 2015 a high ndvi value will indicate high vegetation because it is brought by a combination of high reflectance in the near infrared and a lower reflectance in the red spectral band campbell wynne 2011 similar indices have been developed for image analyses to separate urban surfaces from other surfaces based on the nature of reflection of built up areas on near infrared shortwave infrared bands of the landsat images compared to other surfaces a ratio of summation and difference is used to discern the built up areas zha gao ni 2003 the ratio so created is called the normalized built up index ndbi the other index used with the landsat images to extract built up areas is the new built up index nbi which utilizes the red band 3 the near infrared band 4 and the shortwave infrared band 5 it exploits the unique reflection of built up areas in these bands and maps the built up areas to better accuracy than the ndbi hidayati et al 2018 it relates the three spectral bands red infrared and shortwave infrared in the process of extracting urban areas from the images using these indices it is normally difficult to separate the urban surface from the bare lands the resulting map classifies the built up area together with the bare lands because of the relative spectral similarity enhanced built up and bareness index is an index developed to help distinguish urban from bare land as syakur et al 2012 it applies the near infrared nir shortwave infrared swir and thermal infrared tir simultaneously in mapping urban and bare land from an image this index compared to other urban indices performs better in delineating urban surfaces from a landsat image in delineating water surfaces ndwi normalized difference water index was developed using the green band as a replacement for red because the green region better discriminates water pixels bijeesh narasimhamurthy 2019 numerous additional indices have been developed by making minor modifications to these standard indices for example the modified normalized difference water index mndwi was derived from the ndwi whereby the mid infrared band is used instead of the near infrared band xu hanqiu 2006 lulc change detection studies using spectral indices have been carried out in diverse settings around the world in bangladesh nath 2014 applied the ndvi in quantifying forest cover changes between 1989 and 2010 the study revealed the forest cover in that region was decreasing at the rate of 1 41 due to the combined effects of natural and anthropogenic processes in romania pravalie et al 2014 analyzed the link between the changes of ndvi index values and regional thermal stress to determine the impact of climate change on forest ecosystems the study established a correlation between the peak values of mean annual temperatures represented in space and negative changes in the ndvi index indicating that there exists a connection between thermal stress and degradation of forest species alphan and derse 2013 analyzed landscape changes in the mediterranean turkey using ndvi and found that deforestation occurred at lower altitudes in relatively tiny portions close to the shoreline and roadways while forest regeneration occurred primarily in the high plains sinha et al 2016 extensively used the ndbi in monitoring urbanization trends in adama municipal in ethiopia and concluded that the index provides an easy and simplest method of extracting built up portions from other areas in pakistan the ndbi was used in combination with ndvi in exploring the impacts of the green land and the build up land on the urban heat island in which it was revealed that green land can weaken the effect on urban heat island while the built up land can strengthen the effect of urban heat island in a particular place liu jiang 2020 a study by rokni et al 2014 applied the ndwi in monitoring changes in lake urmia surface area in iran and realized an intense decreasing trend in surface area in the period 2000 2013 the study concluded that ndwi is a highly effective approach for surface water change detection in the usa ballanti et al 2017 quantified the historical vegetation change within a wetland in nisqually river watershed the authors observed a 79 increase in emergent marsh wetland within the watershed and attributed it to the restoration efforts that occurred in several phases through 2009 a combination of ndvi ndbi and ndwi indices was used by pattanayak and diwakar 2018 for a better evaluation of the evolution patterns of urban surfaces in hyderabad city in india hussain et al 2019 study analyzed the pattern of lulc ndbi and ndvi change in lodhran district pakistan and found that the region is characterized by rising temperatures less irrigation water and low rainfall a combination of lst ndvi ndwi and ndbi indices were applied in assessing the role of land cover and water body on the micro climate in kuwait uddin et al 2010 from the study it was found that between 1991 and 2017 the highest temperature decreased significantly area of vegetation coverage increased at a significant rate area of water body remained almost unchanged and the barren area is diminished significantly leading to a micro climate with no overheating conditions in this study we focus on the detection of landscape changes in the kenyan lake victoria basin klvb using remote sensing multi spectral indices the lake victoria basin is kenya s greatest watershed supporting the livelihoods of millions of people spread within the western region okungu et al 2005 ochieng et al 2013 through the provision of fishing grounds tourism opportunities transportation and water supply twesigye et al 2011 over the years the klvb has been experiencing land degradation and overexploitation arising from population growth and socio economic development activities swallow et al 2009 as this region continues to grow in population and socio economic activity it experiences some landscape changes especially on the three major land cover classes of vegetation water bodies and build up area measuring and documenting the nature of these changes is important for informing policy and decision making for sustainable management therefore the main objective of the study is to apply the ndvi ndwi and ndbi endbi indices to assess the changes in vegetation water bodies and build up area respectively in the klvb over 40 years 1978 2018 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area lake victoria is a natural resource that traverses three east african nations of kenya tanzania and uganda at various proportions okungu et al 2005 the lake is situated along the equator between latitudes 0 20 n 3 s and longitudes 31 39 e 34 53 w juma wang li 2014 lying at an altitude of 1134 m above sea level lake victoria covers a 68 000 km2 basin area and holds an estimated 2750 km3 volume of water making it africa s largest freshwater lake and the world s second most expansive freshwater mass okungu et al 2005 the lake is rather shallow since the deepest part of the lake only reaches 80 m and the mean depth has been established to be about 40 m muyodi et al 2010 about 80 of the lake s water emanates from direct precipitation because the watershed of lake victoria is known to experience mean annual rainfall in the range of 900 mm to 2600 mm the water from inflowing rivers and streams accounts for the remaining 20 there are numerous outlets in form of rivers drawing water out of the lake but the major one is the white nile which outflows towards egypt through uganda zhou et al 2014 noted that the average annual rates of evaporation of lake victoria range within 1100 mm to 2400 mm hence the water balance of the lake is maintained by both rainfall and vaporization lake victoria has a catchment area lake victoria basin of about 250 000 km2 spread across kenya uganda tanzania rwanda burundi and parts of the democratic republic of congo owuor et al 2012 this basin provides ecological resources and services estimated to support the livelihoods of over 40 million people in the region ochieng et al 2013 according to ochieng et al 2013 it is estimated that about 22 of the total lake victoria basin lvb area falls within kenyan boundaries ochieng et al 2013 this portion of the basin hereafter referred to as the kenyan lake victoria basin klvb is found in the western part of kenya and constitutes the study area of the present study the study area traverses five regional administrative units of kenya known as counties namely homabay migori siaya kisumu and busia as shown in fig 1 the klvb has been experiencing land degradation and overexploitation over the years due to population growth and socio economic advancement swallow et al 2009 this degradation has caused some landscape changes therefore present research focuses on analyzing the changes that have occurred between 1978 and 2018 2 2 data acquisition the study combined both remote sensing and gis techniques in analyzing historical landscape changes in the lake victoria basin during the period between 1978 and 2018 multi temporal imageries from landsat 4 5 thematic mapper tm landsat 7 enhanced thematic mapper plus etm and landsat 8 operational land satellite thematic infrared scanner oli tirs covering the klvb were geo referenced and downloaded from the united states geological survey usgs website www earthexplorer usgs gov the landsat datasets path row 170 60 from the images utilized bands having 30 m spatial resolution in change detection studies the acquisition period i e season month of multi date imagery is directly related to phenology climatic conditions and solar angle and therefore it is important to target one single period i e season month because of the relative stability of the phenology climatic conditions and solar angle théau 2006 this relative stability is essential in providing temporal consistency and comparability of images required for accurate interpretation panuju et al 2020 the imageries used in this study were acquired for the dry month of july which is cloud free and therefore were of high quality théau 2006 notes that in vegetation change studies i e over different years the summertime is usually an ideal target period because of the relative stability of phenology solar angle and climatic conditions table 1 provides further details on the spatial spectral and radiometric specifications landsat satellite imageries 2 3 data analysis and interpretation the acquired images then underwent initial pre processing procedures of geometric and radiometric corrections in erdas imagine software to enhance their quality and achieve better results in addition they were atmospherically corrected by reducing image noise as well as the impacts of haze captured on the images the images were then taken through final pre processing operations such as layer stacking image sub setting and image resampling before being subjected to analysis the imageries were calibrated to surface reflectance based on the methods described by vermote et al 2016 this is to ensure consistency when comparing indices over time and from different sensors guo et al 2020 in this process the representative reflectance image for a july month of a given year was calculated based on equation 1 described in vermote et al 2016 liang wang 2020 supervised lulc classification approach was used in extracting vegetation water body and built up landscapes based on the values of ndvi ndwi ndbi and endbi computed based on a combination of various spectral bands in their respective algorithms five landsat images for a july month of a given year were used to calculate the indices 1 j x i j n n f red t i j ρ i j red 2 j n n f nir t i j ρ i j red 2 whereby fred ti and fnir ti are the quadratic polynomial functions for the red and nir bands respectively xi ared bred cred anir bnir cnir t is a control vector consisting of the coefficients of the quadratic polynomial functions n is the size of the moving time window which in this study was set to 2 and ρi red and ρi nir are the surface reflectance for the ith position in the red and nir bands respectively detailed information about the application of this formula has been given by xiao et al 2015 first the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is used to measure the amount of vegetation cover in an area and therefore is quite useful in discerning the changes in the acreage of the green vegetation as urban centers grow it relates the near infrared nir band with the red r band which is essential for measuring the vegetation cover and vigor sahebjalal dashtekian 2013 ndvi was extracted using equation 2 described in bhatti and tripathi 2014 the resultant values of the ndvi fall within the range of 1 to 1 values that tend to lean towards 1 show high spectral reflectance of healthy vegetation while values that tend to lean towards 1 show unhealthy or no vegetation at all 2 ndvi nir r nir r secondly the normalized difference built up index ndbi is the other ratio that was used in the analysis ndbi is based on rationing the sum and difference of the reflectance of the shortwave infrared swir band and the near infrared nir band of the landsat image zha et al 2003 ndbi was also extracted using equation 3 described in bhatti and tripathi 2014 the resultant values of the ndbi were within 1 to 1 values that tend to lean towards 1 show high spectral reflectance of built up areas and values that tend to lean towards 1 show low built up areas however the ndbi has vegetation and bare soil noise which have to be removed using other indices ndvi and ndwi the ndwi uses green g and near infrared nir bands of remote sensing images whereby the green band maximizes the water content while the infrared band which has a very high reflection of vegetation minimizes the water value hidayati et al 2018 the ndwi was extracted using equation 4 described in bhatti and tripathi 2014 the resultant values of ndwi also fall in the range of 1 to 1 values that tend to lean towards 1 show high water content of the land cover while values that tend to lean towards 1 show little or no water content in the land cover 3 ndbi swir nir swir nir 4 ndwi g nir g nir after extracting built up areas using ndbi the result still has vegetation noise and is difficult to differentiate between built up areas and bare soil hence need to subtract ndvi and ndwi from the ndbi through an index called enhanced normalized difference built up index endbi as shown in equation 5 ndvi is subtracted to suppress vegetation noise from the ndbi image since bare land and built up areas have close spectral reflectance it s difficult to differentiate between the two however the difference in water content between the two makes it easier to differentiate them bare soil tends to have more water content than built up areas hence removing ndbi from ndvi suppresses the bare soil thus making built up areas shouting in the image the endbi method is effective in showing the probability that where a deep red pixel occurs represents the likelihood of development of built up areas such as pavements asphalt roads and parking spaces from the non urban areas such as forests farmlands and grasslands bhatti tripathi 2014 subsequently for each index the classified images for the years 1978 1988 1998 2008 and 2018 were used to produce maps in arcmap to validate the classified images ground truthing was conducted through fieldwork involving capturing of gps coordinates of the ground reference points which were digitized from google earth 5 endbi ndbi ndvi ndwi 3 results and discussion 3 1 change detection by ndvi the ndvi is a standardized index that enables us to generate information showing vegetation density vigor campbell wynne 2011 ganie nusrath 2016 this index is favored for global vegetation monitoring since it compensates for changing lighting conditions surface slope aspect and other external factors lillesand et al 2008 ndvi essentially measures the amount of vegetation cover in an area on a scale ranging from 1 to 1 whereby negative values correspond to non vegetated surfaces while positive corresponds to vegetated ones martinuzzi et al 2008 generally a higher ndvi means greener dense and healthy vegetation on the landscape whereas a lower one means less sparse vegetation or more non vegetation classes ganie nusrath 2016 specific ndvi ranges correspond to various cover types on a landscape as shown in table 2 according to the ndvi classification in table 2 water typically has ndvi values below 0 negative values open bare exposed soils between 0 and 0 1 and vegetation begins from ndvi above 0 1 martinuzzi et al 2008 note that in locations where vegetation canopies do not achieve total coverage the ndvi is vulnerable to the spectral influence of the soil resulting in interpretation errors to compare the evolution of vegetated areas to that of non vegetated surfaces between the years 1978 2018 change detection through ndvi image classification was undertaken summarized results of the yearly high and low ndvi values obtained are presented in table 3 the results show that the positive highest ndvi values ranged between 0 64 and 0 78 an indication of the existence of dense vegetation in the klvb throughout the period between 1978 and 2018 this ndvi range implies that the region enjoyed the presence of healthy vegetation during that period because according to uddin and mondal 2020 healthy vegetation or expanse forested areas are represented by ndvi values beyond 0 60 while unhealthy vegetation or scattered shrubs and bushes are represented by positive values below 0 60 generally healthy vegetation usually records ndvi values towards 1 because of high nir reflectance and low red reflectance due to absorption by chlorophyll as compared to unhealthy vegetation uddin mondal 2020 on the other hand the negative lowest ndvi values for the years ranged between 0 64 and 0 28 an indication of the existence of a water body aqueous surfaces which for this case implies lake victoria variation among the positive highest ndvi values during the various years is not much pronounced as the variation among the negative lowest ndvi values the positive ndvi values remained relatively constant between 1978 and 1988 before taking an alternate increase and decrease trajectory from one decade to the other from 1988 to 2018 whereas the negative ndvi showed an alternate increase and decrease turns from one decade to the other from 1978 to 2018 these results indicate that there was a high stability in vegetation density between 1978 and 1988 followed by fluctuations from one decade to the next on the other hand aqueous water surfaces have been experiencing alternating periods of decreasing and increasing coverages the observed trends were confirmed by the visual inspection of ndvi maps fig 2 as well as rgb images appendix 1 for the years 1978 1988 1998 2008 and 2018 demonstrating the evolution of vegetation from 1978 to 2018 in which the increment of the quantity of vegetation pixels can be seen in these images the dense vegetation content is denoted by the green coloration sparse vegetation is denoted by yellow color and non vegetation content is denoted by red color the red parts represent lake victoria which is surrounded by the areas under sparse vegetation along the shores yellow parts and as you move further from the shores the vegetation density greenness increases the shores of lake victoria are characterized by sparse vegetation because most parts of these areas have been cleared either left bare or developed into urban centers to accommodate the growing population and the socio economic development it is due to these factors that the places under high vegetation density like farmlands forestlands shrublands and grasslands continued to be pushed further away from the shores over the years the trend of alternating decreases and increases in vegetation over the decades can be attributed to the interplay between population growth economic growth climate change and policy framework over the years must have contributed to various levels of fluctuations ogashawara and bastos 2012 posited that fluctuations of alternating decreases and increases in vegetation content for some areas can occur amid urban expansion over the years because of the erection of infrastructure including urban parks which would later have green spaces for enhancing the quality of life as well as conservation based on the maps in fig 2 the ndvi for 1978 was more pronounced than for 2018 this generally implies that most areas of grasslands forests and shrublands were actively undergoing conversion to provide land for other competing land uses such as grazing agricultural and settlement purposes naburi et al 2018 this occurs through deforestation practices construction and bush burning activities which are rampant within the region awange et al 2007 odada et al 2009 according to mugure and oino 2013 about 80 of deforested areas in developing countries such as kenya are often used for agricultural purposes clearing of forests shrublands and wetlands for agricultural production became so widespread in kenya around the mid 1990 s that the government was compelled to institute a permanent ban on tree harvesting from designated locations of ecological significance oeba et al 2012 however recently most deforestation practices in kenya are attributed to increased demand for wood fuel and forest products for settlement and infrastructural related developments for the increasing population and urbanization ngaira omwayi 2012 owuor et al 2012 believe that trade in wood fuel and forest products have been increasing within the klvb due to pervasive high poverty levels 3 2 change detection by ndwi the ndwi is a water index that is effective in highlighting the water pixels from the landscape bijeesh narasimhamurth 2019 and therefore is widely applied in water bodies analysis bhatta 2011 ndwi highlights water related features of the landscapes i e water bodies in their liquid state and plant water content on a scale ranging from 1 to 1 whereby negative values correspond to non aqueous surfaces built up and bare lands while positive corresponds to aqueous ones water bodies and vegetated landscapes jrc european commission 2011 specific ndwi values correspond to various cover types as shown in table 4 bhatta 2011 observes that ndwi can be used to distinguish water bodies vegetated lands and built up lands more easily to discriminate and compare the evolution of aqueous surfaces to that of non aqueous surfaces between the years 1978 2018 change detection through ndwi image classification was undertaken summarized results of the yearly highest and lowest ndwi values obtained are presented in table 5 the results show that the positive highest ndwi values ranged between 0 28 and 0 88 which shows the existence of aqueous surfaces of high moisture content water body and densely vegetated landscapes in the klvb throughout the period between 1978 and 2018 a water body is represented by ndwi values beyond 0 50 while lower than that denotes other land covers uddin mondal 2020 certain bare lands have exposed soil surfaces containing water and therefore usually register high positive ndwi on the other hand the negative lowest ndwi values for the years ranged between 0 69 and 0 57 showing the existence of non aqueous surfaces with no moisture content built up and bare lands built up areas are mostly covered by extensive impervious landscapes above the soil and so they usually register low ndwi due to diminished water content eid et al 2020 bare lands are often found in drought conditions characterized by reduced water content in the soil and foliage causing the index to fall towards negative values nicacias 2009 an alternating increasing and decreasing trend were observed among the positive highest ndwi values during the various years whereas the negative lowest ndwi values showed an increasing trend from one decade to the other from 1978 to 2018 the results indicate that the high moisture content denoting water body and densely vegetated landscapes observed in 1978 experienced alternating periods of decrease and increase while the non aqueous surfaces dry landscapes such as built up and bare lands showed an increasing trend over the years these trends were confirmed by the visual inspection of ndwi maps for the years 1978 1988 1998 2008 and 2018 fig 3 in which the distribution of the quantity of water pixels can be seen in these images the maximum water content highest ndwi values is denoted by the deep dark blue coloration while the minimum water content lowest ndwi values is denoted by the faded light blue coloration water bodies in a liquid form generally appear deep dark blue because they have higher reflectance on the blue 0 4 0 5 µm spectrum than the green 0 5 0 6 µm and red 0 6 0 7 µm spectrum bhatta 2011 the ndwi results generally indicate that the klvb landscape in 1978 was dominated by vegetated landscapes alongside lake victoria but these surfaces declined over time due to the increasing coverage of built up and bare lands necessitated by the expansion of urban centers or the creation of new ones the vegetation loss that occurred in the basin must have been due to the conversion of natural environments such as grasslands forests and agricultural areas to build environments such as roads pavements buildings bridges and car park lots among others all the key elements of urban expansion within the watershed over the years moreover the results show that the level of lake victoria waters has been experiencing fluctuations which can be associated with climate variability or other anthropogenic effects jalili et al 2016 this is consistent with a previous study by awange et al 2007 even though the presence of lake victoria is permanent rampant flooding in the basin and installation of various irrigation systems in agricultural landscapes swenson wahr 2009 ombogo 2016 vanderkelen et al 2018 within the basin could be contributing factors to the rise in moisture level while wetlands reclamation oroda et al 2016 and receding water levels of the lake kairu 2001 swenson wahr 2009 could have contributed to the decline in moisture levels in the klvb also the rampant drought conditions in some parts of the basin ombogo 2016 might have caused water stress on the vegetation for the last two decades alone about 62 of wetland areas around lake victoria have been converted to agricultural land isunju 2016 3 3 change detection by ndbi ndbi facilitates the mapping of broad urban land covers by highlighting built up areas at a higher degree of accuracy and objectivity xu 2008 simwanda murayama 2018 on a scale ranging from 1 to 1 whereby negative values represent water bodies positive values represents higher built up and other paved surfaces and zero value represent areas covered with vegetation he et al 2010 however xu 2008 notes that one problem of ndbi in mapping urban land covers is that it s impossible to discriminate urban industrial commercial and residential areas of the built up developing areas they all have a waterproof surface that has nearly the same reflectance andriani et al 2018 to demonstrate the evolution of built up surfaces in the klvb between the years 1978 2018 change detection through ndbi image classification was undertaken summarized results of the yearly highest and lowest ndbi values obtained are presented in table 6 the ndbi compares built up areas to surfaces covered by water bodies the results show that the positive highest ndbi values ranged between 0 60 and 0 87 which shows the existence of higher built up and other paved surfaces in the klvb throughout the period between 1978 and 2018 on the other hand the negative lowest ndbi values for the years ranged between 0 83 and 0 55 showing the existence of surfaces covered by water bodies a generally increasing trend was observed among the positive highest ndbi values during the various years whereas the negative lowest ndbi values showed an alternating increasing and decreasing trend from one decade to the other from 1978 to 2018 the results indicate that the higher built up and other paved surfaces denoting urban sprawl increasing over the years whereas the water bodies including lake victoria and wetlands experienced alternating periods of decrease and increase over the years these trends were confirmed by the visual inspection of ndbi maps for the years 1978 1988 1998 2008 and 2018 fig 4 in which the distribution of the quantity of built up pixels can be seen in these images the increasing red coloration is a proxy for the increasing intensity of urban growth in lake victoria the ndbi is multi colored with the increasing red regions denoting growth of urban development ogashawara bastos 2012 generally the results that between 1978 and 2018 the built up area had been rapidly expanding in the klvb implying intensification of urban development characterized by increasing imperviousness marginal vegetation cover and less water content sharma et al 2015 like the ndwi the ndbi showed alternating periods of decrease and increase over the years for water bodies and wetlands which could be attributed to the factors already discussed for ndwi trends unlike the ndwi the ndbi is never affected by the prevailing hydric conditions as it uses spectral bands that are found in the near infrared part of the em spectrum hence clear visibility in the results liu zhang 2011 this study found ndbi to be a reliable metric of urban development for a particular geographical location confirming the observation of earlier studies liu zhang 2011 ogashawara bastos 2012 however in acknowledging the inherent limitations of ndbi in singling out built up areas from urban areas correctly the study further employed the use of the endbi index discussed in the next section the endbi provides capabilities for accurately distinguishing built up areas from bare lands in urban areas bhatti tripathi 2014 and therefore it is a more effective metric for urban development features compared to the ndbi essentially ndbi is good but endbi is better with regards to distinctively measuring all the features of urban development 3 4 change detection by endbi in endbi the positive value denotes bare land the negative values represent the built up area and zero denotes vegetation cover bhatti tripathi 2014 this study used endbi to distinguish built up areas from bare lands in urban areas summarized results of the yearly highest and lowest endbi values obtained are presented in table 7 according to the results highest positive endbi values for the various years ranged between 0 60 and 1 04 while the lowest negative ndbi values for the different years ranged between 1 21 and 0 58 the high endbi values showed a decreasing trend whereas the low endbi values showed an increasing trend over the years these trends were confirmed by the visual inspection of endbi maps for the years 1978 1988 1998 2008 and 2018 fig 5 the endbi operates on the premise that the presence of a deep red pixel high value shows a likely occurrence of development or built up activity bhatti tripathi 2014 the trends show that as the bare lands declined the built up areas continued to rise over the years this implies that urban development has been increasing over the years especially around the shores characterized by the conversion of open areas to developed areas across the regions in klvb shadrack 2015 posited that this trend has increased over the years in the whole country with the dawn of devolved governance in kenya in 2010 which made counties the basis for development generally the ndvi indicated an intense decreasing trend in the density of vegetated landscapes three indices of ndvi ndwi and ndbi depicted fluctuations in moisture content in lake victoria and its wetlands the ndbi endbi both shown an intense increasing trend in the built up area expansion in the klvb during the period between 1978 and 2018 this finding was consistent with previous studies that observed an increasing trend of built up surfaces in klvb rakama et al 2017 these changes in built up areas suggest that urban development has been rapidly progressing within the region over the years juma et al 2014 observed that rapid population growth and socio economic development are the major drivers of urban expansion in the entire klvb according to the findings of the present study intense urbanization in this watershed has been largely concentrated on locations adjacent to the shores of lake victoria this is could be because the majority of the watershed residents are highly attracted to the areas bordering the shores providing rich and easily accessible fisheries resources fertile soils and water availability for farming practices juma et al 2014 these lucrative economic activities drive rural urban migration which in turn empowers population growth resulting in urbanization in the region ochieng et al 2013 according to kenya s commission for revenue allocation cra 2011 the population of klvb has been rapidly increasing over the years in tandem with national population growth in the country the current ecological condition of lake victoria indicates that the environmental effects of urbanization are pervasive throughout its watershed the ecological problems in the lake victoria ecosystem potentially emanating from urbanization have been well documented in the available literature the waters of lake victoria have persistently been reported over the years by various studies to be highly polluted ruhiu 2004 babu et al 2015 roegner et al 2020 according to these previous studies the sources of water pollution in the lake include nutrients and organic material loading from domestic municipal and industrial wastewater and solid waste disposal systems these pollutants are carried by the run off water and deposited into the lake increased run off arises from the extensive impervious surfaces created by the continuous urban growth and urban sprawl within the catchment pollution loading from the sprawling urban area has been established to be responsible for the infestation of harmful algal bloom and invasive species eichhornia crassipes in the lake hecky et al 2010 sitoki et al 2010 juma et al 2014 roegner et al 2020 some areas within the klvb are known to usually experience rampant catastrophic flooding juma et al 2014 periodic flooding has been reported in various regions within the lake victoria basin such as nyando kano and sondu miriu khan et al 2010 kundu olang 2011 bakibinga ibembe et al 2011 flooding events have been known to occur more frequently in highly urbanized watersheds such as the klvb this is because these areas are often characterized by extensive impervious surfaces comprising of rooftops pavements asphalt roads and parking spaces o driscoll et al 2010 which impairs rainfall water storage capacity and infiltration mechanisms leading to increased volume of storm runoff generation wenger et al 2009 the increased storm runoff volumes translate into increased occurrence and rigor of flooding catastrophes within watersheds wang et al 2011 these environmental effects of urbanization threaten the lives and livelihoods of the watershed residents for example pollution emanating from urbanization presents grave public health concerns roegner et al 2020 as well as threatening the survival of aquatic life including fish resources sitoki et al 2010 upon which the economic survival of the basin inhabitants is primarily anchored moreover voluminous amounts of run off draining from the impervious built environment of urban areas accelerate erosion from the fertile agricultural lands causing land degradation and hence reducing agricultural productivity land degradation and the subsequent reduction in agricultural productivity constitutes one of the causes of widespread poverty levels among farming communities around this region who are not actively involved in the fishing industry for some reasons including the far distance from the lake mitigating these environmental problems starts from understanding their root causes which this study has attempted to achieve 4 conclusions the change detection analysis indicated that the klvb is experiencing rapid and intense urban development characterized by declining wetlands vegetated landscapes including agricultural and forest lands and increasing barren and built up areas most of the urban development in the klvb was located around the shores of lake victoria from where they progress outwards to major administrative centers around the region a demonstration of the unplanned patterns of land usage on the environment these patterns if left uncontrolled could potentially exacerbate the current environmental problems experienced in the watershed hence there s a need for strengthening national and county urban development planning framework that strikes a balance between economic development and environmental conservation furthermore intensive and strategic planning of the already established urban areas within the watershed is recommended to realize the sustainability of other natural resources in the watershed the study concluded that the four multi spectral indices were able to correctly show the intensity and magnitude of urbanization hence they hold significant opportunities and potential in modern environmental assessments moreover a combination of the four spectral indices was found to be a better improvement when compared to the individual methods and the available ground truth data for future studies we recommend the application of machine learning based classification techniques in carrying out similar research in the klvb to see if it can yield similar results funding this study was funded by a grant provided to the first named author by the african union commission auc the funding

20051,the kenyan lake victoria basin has been experiencing land degradation and overexploitation as seen in various landscape changes quantifying and understanding the nature of these changes is essential for management decision making this study sought to apply the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi normalized difference water index ndwi and normalized difference built up index ndbi enhanced normalized difference built up index ndbi endbi indices to assess the changes in vegetation water bodies and build up area respectively in the basin between 1978 and 2018 landsat imageries for 1978 1988 1998 2008 and 2018 with thematic oriented bands were acquired pre processed and subjected to spectral based classification techniques in arcgis software to compute and generate ndvi ndwi and ndbi endbi maps according to the results ndvi indicated an intense decreasing trend in the density of vegetated landscapes while ndvi ndwi and ndbi all depicted fluctuations in moisture content in lake victoria and its wetlands the ndbi endbi showed an intense increasing trend in the built up area expansion based on these changes the study concluded that urban development has been rapidly progressing within the lake victoria basin over the years intensive and strategic planning that strikes a balance between economic development and environmental conservation is recommended to realize the sustainability of this important watershed keywords lake victoria basin remote sensing change detection multi spectral indices 1 introduction the earth s surface is continually transforming due to several factors many of which are anthropogenic induced chu et al 2009 only a few landscapes around the world are still in their natural state ayele et al 2018 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2019 reported that over 70 of the world s land surface has been directly impacted by anthropogenic utilization land use and land cover change lulc which in most cases involve converting naturally existing landscapes into agricultural land or build up areas for residential or commercial purposes when left uncontrolled often results in serious environmental degradation issues including disasters and food insecurity unep 2016 ipcc 2019 understanding the trends causes and consequences of these changes can be aided by mapping and visualizing them hesping 2020 monitoring and analysis of lulc changes have become a distinct area of scientific study with applications in both the public and private sectors hesping 2020 remote sensing which refers to the gathering of geospatial information from space or the air willis 2015 is a powerful tool that has been applied by numerous researchers in detecting classifying and monitoring land use and land cover changes demir et al 2012 salmon et al 2013 this is due to its benefits over traditional ground based surveys which can be time consuming labor intensive and costly willis 2015 the capabilities of remote sensing include availing consistent accurate and suitable observations on the distribution pattern of lulc over an expanse geographical area rogan chen 2004 dezso et al 2005 willis 2015 mapping and analyzing lulc changes through remote sensing follows land cover classification and change detection methodologies change detection is one of the most popular applications of remote sensing analysis of landscape transformation processes and refers to the process of comparing the differences in the features of a particular area or phenomenon over two or more temporal epochs hussain et al 2013 it s a process in which two lulc images observed at different times are classified separately and the results of the two classifications are compared lillesand et al 2015 for an effective change detection analysis a period of at least ten years is needed with data being collected every 2 years to account for rapid changes huang et al 2009 change detection generally entails analyzing the temporal dynamics of a phenomenon quantitatively using multi temporal datasets lu et al 2004 the multi temporal data sets are records of conditions at different places over different epochs of time available in images that have been captured and stored by satellites bhatta 2010 in change detection research the vast and otherwise obscured information in multispectral images can be extracted through various image processing techniques viz spectral mixture analysis wu murray 2003 wu 2009 gong et al 2018 machine learning based classification oommen et al 2008 lary et al 2016 maxwell warner fang 2018 artificial neural networks ann mas flores 2008 singha bellerby trieschmann 2013 şenkal 2010 spectral unmixing based methods plaza et al 2011 dópido et al 2012 zhong et al 2016 among others spectral index based approaches are the most common and widely used of these techniques since they are easy to perform and produce reliable results bijeesh narasimhamurthy 2019 they are developed by mixing data from multiple bands of a multispectral image to improve the accuracy of delineation polykretis grillakis alexakis 2020 several multi spectral indices have been developed to map features on the earth s surface basing on the different biases in reflectivity of the features at various portions of the electromagnetic spectrum polykretis et al 2020 the absorption of the red light by chlorophyll and strong reflectance of infrared radiation by the mesophyll provides the accurate inverse relationship that is used to generate several vegetation ratios for mapping campbell wynne 2011 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is the most widely used vegetation index it is preferred to simple index because it helps compensate for changing illumination conditions slope aspect and other factors lillesand et al 2015 a high ndvi value will indicate high vegetation because it is brought by a combination of high reflectance in the near infrared and a lower reflectance in the red spectral band campbell wynne 2011 similar indices have been developed for image analyses to separate urban surfaces from other surfaces based on the nature of reflection of built up areas on near infrared shortwave infrared bands of the landsat images compared to other surfaces a ratio of summation and difference is used to discern the built up areas zha gao ni 2003 the ratio so created is called the normalized built up index ndbi the other index used with the landsat images to extract built up areas is the new built up index nbi which utilizes the red band 3 the near infrared band 4 and the shortwave infrared band 5 it exploits the unique reflection of built up areas in these bands and maps the built up areas to better accuracy than the ndbi hidayati et al 2018 it relates the three spectral bands red infrared and shortwave infrared in the process of extracting urban areas from the images using these indices it is normally difficult to separate the urban surface from the bare lands the resulting map classifies the built up area together with the bare lands because of the relative spectral similarity enhanced built up and bareness index is an index developed to help distinguish urban from bare land as syakur et al 2012 it applies the near infrared nir shortwave infrared swir and thermal infrared tir simultaneously in mapping urban and bare land from an image this index compared to other urban indices performs better in delineating urban surfaces from a landsat image in delineating water surfaces ndwi normalized difference water index was developed using the green band as a replacement for red because the green region better discriminates water pixels bijeesh narasimhamurthy 2019 numerous additional indices have been developed by making minor modifications to these standard indices for example the modified normalized difference water index mndwi was derived from the ndwi whereby the mid infrared band is used instead of the near infrared band xu hanqiu 2006 lulc change detection studies using spectral indices have been carried out in diverse settings around the world in bangladesh nath 2014 applied the ndvi in quantifying forest cover changes between 1989 and 2010 the study revealed the forest cover in that region was decreasing at the rate of 1 41 due to the combined effects of natural and anthropogenic processes in romania pravalie et al 2014 analyzed the link between the changes of ndvi index values and regional thermal stress to determine the impact of climate change on forest ecosystems the study established a correlation between the peak values of mean annual temperatures represented in space and negative changes in the ndvi index indicating that there exists a connection between thermal stress and degradation of forest species alphan and derse 2013 analyzed landscape changes in the mediterranean turkey using ndvi and found that deforestation occurred at lower altitudes in relatively tiny portions close to the shoreline and roadways while forest regeneration occurred primarily in the high plains sinha et al 2016 extensively used the ndbi in monitoring urbanization trends in adama municipal in ethiopia and concluded that the index provides an easy and simplest method of extracting built up portions from other areas in pakistan the ndbi was used in combination with ndvi in exploring the impacts of the green land and the build up land on the urban heat island in which it was revealed that green land can weaken the effect on urban heat island while the built up land can strengthen the effect of urban heat island in a particular place liu jiang 2020 a study by rokni et al 2014 applied the ndwi in monitoring changes in lake urmia surface area in iran and realized an intense decreasing trend in surface area in the period 2000 2013 the study concluded that ndwi is a highly effective approach for surface water change detection in the usa ballanti et al 2017 quantified the historical vegetation change within a wetland in nisqually river watershed the authors observed a 79 increase in emergent marsh wetland within the watershed and attributed it to the restoration efforts that occurred in several phases through 2009 a combination of ndvi ndbi and ndwi indices was used by pattanayak and diwakar 2018 for a better evaluation of the evolution patterns of urban surfaces in hyderabad city in india hussain et al 2019 study analyzed the pattern of lulc ndbi and ndvi change in lodhran district pakistan and found that the region is characterized by rising temperatures less irrigation water and low rainfall a combination of lst ndvi ndwi and ndbi indices were applied in assessing the role of land cover and water body on the micro climate in kuwait uddin et al 2010 from the study it was found that between 1991 and 2017 the highest temperature decreased significantly area of vegetation coverage increased at a significant rate area of water body remained almost unchanged and the barren area is diminished significantly leading to a micro climate with no overheating conditions in this study we focus on the detection of landscape changes in the kenyan lake victoria basin klvb using remote sensing multi spectral indices the lake victoria basin is kenya s greatest watershed supporting the livelihoods of millions of people spread within the western region okungu et al 2005 ochieng et al 2013 through the provision of fishing grounds tourism opportunities transportation and water supply twesigye et al 2011 over the years the klvb has been experiencing land degradation and overexploitation arising from population growth and socio economic development activities swallow et al 2009 as this region continues to grow in population and socio economic activity it experiences some landscape changes especially on the three major land cover classes of vegetation water bodies and build up area measuring and documenting the nature of these changes is important for informing policy and decision making for sustainable management therefore the main objective of the study is to apply the ndvi ndwi and ndbi endbi indices to assess the changes in vegetation water bodies and build up area respectively in the klvb over 40 years 1978 2018 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area lake victoria is a natural resource that traverses three east african nations of kenya tanzania and uganda at various proportions okungu et al 2005 the lake is situated along the equator between latitudes 0 20 n 3 s and longitudes 31 39 e 34 53 w juma wang li 2014 lying at an altitude of 1134 m above sea level lake victoria covers a 68 000 km2 basin area and holds an estimated 2750 km3 volume of water making it africa s largest freshwater lake and the world s second most expansive freshwater mass okungu et al 2005 the lake is rather shallow since the deepest part of the lake only reaches 80 m and the mean depth has been established to be about 40 m muyodi et al 2010 about 80 of the lake s water emanates from direct precipitation because the watershed of lake victoria is known to experience mean annual rainfall in the range of 900 mm to 2600 mm the water from inflowing rivers and streams accounts for the remaining 20 there are numerous outlets in form of rivers drawing water out of the lake but the major one is the white nile which outflows towards egypt through uganda zhou et al 2014 noted that the average annual rates of evaporation of lake victoria range within 1100 mm to 2400 mm hence the water balance of the lake is maintained by both rainfall and vaporization lake victoria has a catchment area lake victoria basin of about 250 000 km2 spread across kenya uganda tanzania rwanda burundi and parts of the democratic republic of congo owuor et al 2012 this basin provides ecological resources and services estimated to support the livelihoods of over 40 million people in the region ochieng et al 2013 according to ochieng et al 2013 it is estimated that about 22 of the total lake victoria basin lvb area falls within kenyan boundaries ochieng et al 2013 this portion of the basin hereafter referred to as the kenyan lake victoria basin klvb is found in the western part of kenya and constitutes the study area of the present study the study area traverses five regional administrative units of kenya known as counties namely homabay migori siaya kisumu and busia as shown in fig 1 the klvb has been experiencing land degradation and overexploitation over the years due to population growth and socio economic advancement swallow et al 2009 this degradation has caused some landscape changes therefore present research focuses on analyzing the changes that have occurred between 1978 and 2018 2 2 data acquisition the study combined both remote sensing and gis techniques in analyzing historical landscape changes in the lake victoria basin during the period between 1978 and 2018 multi temporal imageries from landsat 4 5 thematic mapper tm landsat 7 enhanced thematic mapper plus etm and landsat 8 operational land satellite thematic infrared scanner oli tirs covering the klvb were geo referenced and downloaded from the united states geological survey usgs website www earthexplorer usgs gov the landsat datasets path row 170 60 from the images utilized bands having 30 m spatial resolution in change detection studies the acquisition period i e season month of multi date imagery is directly related to phenology climatic conditions and solar angle and therefore it is important to target one single period i e season month because of the relative stability of the phenology climatic conditions and solar angle théau 2006 this relative stability is essential in providing temporal consistency and comparability of images required for accurate interpretation panuju et al 2020 the imageries used in this study were acquired for the dry month of july which is cloud free and therefore were of high quality théau 2006 notes that in vegetation change studies i e over different years the summertime is usually an ideal target period because of the relative stability of phenology solar angle and climatic conditions table 1 provides further details on the spatial spectral and radiometric specifications landsat satellite imageries 2 3 data analysis and interpretation the acquired images then underwent initial pre processing procedures of geometric and radiometric corrections in erdas imagine software to enhance their quality and achieve better results in addition they were atmospherically corrected by reducing image noise as well as the impacts of haze captured on the images the images were then taken through final pre processing operations such as layer stacking image sub setting and image resampling before being subjected to analysis the imageries were calibrated to surface reflectance based on the methods described by vermote et al 2016 this is to ensure consistency when comparing indices over time and from different sensors guo et al 2020 in this process the representative reflectance image for a july month of a given year was calculated based on equation 1 described in vermote et al 2016 liang wang 2020 supervised lulc classification approach was used in extracting vegetation water body and built up landscapes based on the values of ndvi ndwi ndbi and endbi computed based on a combination of various spectral bands in their respective algorithms five landsat images for a july month of a given year were used to calculate the indices 1 j x i j n n f red t i j ρ i j red 2 j n n f nir t i j ρ i j red 2 whereby fred ti and fnir ti are the quadratic polynomial functions for the red and nir bands respectively xi ared bred cred anir bnir cnir t is a control vector consisting of the coefficients of the quadratic polynomial functions n is the size of the moving time window which in this study was set to 2 and ρi red and ρi nir are the surface reflectance for the ith position in the red and nir bands respectively detailed information about the application of this formula has been given by xiao et al 2015 first the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is used to measure the amount of vegetation cover in an area and therefore is quite useful in discerning the changes in the acreage of the green vegetation as urban centers grow it relates the near infrared nir band with the red r band which is essential for measuring the vegetation cover and vigor sahebjalal dashtekian 2013 ndvi was extracted using equation 2 described in bhatti and tripathi 2014 the resultant values of the ndvi fall within the range of 1 to 1 values that tend to lean towards 1 show high spectral reflectance of healthy vegetation while values that tend to lean towards 1 show unhealthy or no vegetation at all 2 ndvi nir r nir r secondly the normalized difference built up index ndbi is the other ratio that was used in the analysis ndbi is based on rationing the sum and difference of the reflectance of the shortwave infrared swir band and the near infrared nir band of the landsat image zha et al 2003 ndbi was also extracted using equation 3 described in bhatti and tripathi 2014 the resultant values of the ndbi were within 1 to 1 values that tend to lean towards 1 show high spectral reflectance of built up areas and values that tend to lean towards 1 show low built up areas however the ndbi has vegetation and bare soil noise which have to be removed using other indices ndvi and ndwi the ndwi uses green g and near infrared nir bands of remote sensing images whereby the green band maximizes the water content while the infrared band which has a very high reflection of vegetation minimizes the water value hidayati et al 2018 the ndwi was extracted using equation 4 described in bhatti and tripathi 2014 the resultant values of ndwi also fall in the range of 1 to 1 values that tend to lean towards 1 show high water content of the land cover while values that tend to lean towards 1 show little or no water content in the land cover 3 ndbi swir nir swir nir 4 ndwi g nir g nir after extracting built up areas using ndbi the result still has vegetation noise and is difficult to differentiate between built up areas and bare soil hence need to subtract ndvi and ndwi from the ndbi through an index called enhanced normalized difference built up index endbi as shown in equation 5 ndvi is subtracted to suppress vegetation noise from the ndbi image since bare land and built up areas have close spectral reflectance it s difficult to differentiate between the two however the difference in water content between the two makes it easier to differentiate them bare soil tends to have more water content than built up areas hence removing ndbi from ndvi suppresses the bare soil thus making built up areas shouting in the image the endbi method is effective in showing the probability that where a deep red pixel occurs represents the likelihood of development of built up areas such as pavements asphalt roads and parking spaces from the non urban areas such as forests farmlands and grasslands bhatti tripathi 2014 subsequently for each index the classified images for the years 1978 1988 1998 2008 and 2018 were used to produce maps in arcmap to validate the classified images ground truthing was conducted through fieldwork involving capturing of gps coordinates of the ground reference points which were digitized from google earth 5 endbi ndbi ndvi ndwi 3 results and discussion 3 1 change detection by ndvi the ndvi is a standardized index that enables us to generate information showing vegetation density vigor campbell wynne 2011 ganie nusrath 2016 this index is favored for global vegetation monitoring since it compensates for changing lighting conditions surface slope aspect and other external factors lillesand et al 2008 ndvi essentially measures the amount of vegetation cover in an area on a scale ranging from 1 to 1 whereby negative values correspond to non vegetated surfaces while positive corresponds to vegetated ones martinuzzi et al 2008 generally a higher ndvi means greener dense and healthy vegetation on the landscape whereas a lower one means less sparse vegetation or more non vegetation classes ganie nusrath 2016 specific ndvi ranges correspond to various cover types on a landscape as shown in table 2 according to the ndvi classification in table 2 water typically has ndvi values below 0 negative values open bare exposed soils between 0 and 0 1 and vegetation begins from ndvi above 0 1 martinuzzi et al 2008 note that in locations where vegetation canopies do not achieve total coverage the ndvi is vulnerable to the spectral influence of the soil resulting in interpretation errors to compare the evolution of vegetated areas to that of non vegetated surfaces between the years 1978 2018 change detection through ndvi image classification was undertaken summarized results of the yearly high and low ndvi values obtained are presented in table 3 the results show that the positive highest ndvi values ranged between 0 64 and 0 78 an indication of the existence of dense vegetation in the klvb throughout the period between 1978 and 2018 this ndvi range implies that the region enjoyed the presence of healthy vegetation during that period because according to uddin and mondal 2020 healthy vegetation or expanse forested areas are represented by ndvi values beyond 0 60 while unhealthy vegetation or scattered shrubs and bushes are represented by positive values below 0 60 generally healthy vegetation usually records ndvi values towards 1 because of high nir reflectance and low red reflectance due to absorption by chlorophyll as compared to unhealthy vegetation uddin mondal 2020 on the other hand the negative lowest ndvi values for the years ranged between 0 64 and 0 28 an indication of the existence of a water body aqueous surfaces which for this case implies lake victoria variation among the positive highest ndvi values during the various years is not much pronounced as the variation among the negative lowest ndvi values the positive ndvi values remained relatively constant between 1978 and 1988 before taking an alternate increase and decrease trajectory from one decade to the other from 1988 to 2018 whereas the negative ndvi showed an alternate increase and decrease turns from one decade to the other from 1978 to 2018 these results indicate that there was a high stability in vegetation density between 1978 and 1988 followed by fluctuations from one decade to the next on the other hand aqueous water surfaces have been experiencing alternating periods of decreasing and increasing coverages the observed trends were confirmed by the visual inspection of ndvi maps fig 2 as well as rgb images appendix 1 for the years 1978 1988 1998 2008 and 2018 demonstrating the evolution of vegetation from 1978 to 2018 in which the increment of the quantity of vegetation pixels can be seen in these images the dense vegetation content is denoted by the green coloration sparse vegetation is denoted by yellow color and non vegetation content is denoted by red color the red parts represent lake victoria which is surrounded by the areas under sparse vegetation along the shores yellow parts and as you move further from the shores the vegetation density greenness increases the shores of lake victoria are characterized by sparse vegetation because most parts of these areas have been cleared either left bare or developed into urban centers to accommodate the growing population and the socio economic development it is due to these factors that the places under high vegetation density like farmlands forestlands shrublands and grasslands continued to be pushed further away from the shores over the years the trend of alternating decreases and increases in vegetation over the decades can be attributed to the interplay between population growth economic growth climate change and policy framework over the years must have contributed to various levels of fluctuations ogashawara and bastos 2012 posited that fluctuations of alternating decreases and increases in vegetation content for some areas can occur amid urban expansion over the years because of the erection of infrastructure including urban parks which would later have green spaces for enhancing the quality of life as well as conservation based on the maps in fig 2 the ndvi for 1978 was more pronounced than for 2018 this generally implies that most areas of grasslands forests and shrublands were actively undergoing conversion to provide land for other competing land uses such as grazing agricultural and settlement purposes naburi et al 2018 this occurs through deforestation practices construction and bush burning activities which are rampant within the region awange et al 2007 odada et al 2009 according to mugure and oino 2013 about 80 of deforested areas in developing countries such as kenya are often used for agricultural purposes clearing of forests shrublands and wetlands for agricultural production became so widespread in kenya around the mid 1990 s that the government was compelled to institute a permanent ban on tree harvesting from designated locations of ecological significance oeba et al 2012 however recently most deforestation practices in kenya are attributed to increased demand for wood fuel and forest products for settlement and infrastructural related developments for the increasing population and urbanization ngaira omwayi 2012 owuor et al 2012 believe that trade in wood fuel and forest products have been increasing within the klvb due to pervasive high poverty levels 3 2 change detection by ndwi the ndwi is a water index that is effective in highlighting the water pixels from the landscape bijeesh narasimhamurth 2019 and therefore is widely applied in water bodies analysis bhatta 2011 ndwi highlights water related features of the landscapes i e water bodies in their liquid state and plant water content on a scale ranging from 1 to 1 whereby negative values correspond to non aqueous surfaces built up and bare lands while positive corresponds to aqueous ones water bodies and vegetated landscapes jrc european commission 2011 specific ndwi values correspond to various cover types as shown in table 4 bhatta 2011 observes that ndwi can be used to distinguish water bodies vegetated lands and built up lands more easily to discriminate and compare the evolution of aqueous surfaces to that of non aqueous surfaces between the years 1978 2018 change detection through ndwi image classification was undertaken summarized results of the yearly highest and lowest ndwi values obtained are presented in table 5 the results show that the positive highest ndwi values ranged between 0 28 and 0 88 which shows the existence of aqueous surfaces of high moisture content water body and densely vegetated landscapes in the klvb throughout the period between 1978 and 2018 a water body is represented by ndwi values beyond 0 50 while lower than that denotes other land covers uddin mondal 2020 certain bare lands have exposed soil surfaces containing water and therefore usually register high positive ndwi on the other hand the negative lowest ndwi values for the years ranged between 0 69 and 0 57 showing the existence of non aqueous surfaces with no moisture content built up and bare lands built up areas are mostly covered by extensive impervious landscapes above the soil and so they usually register low ndwi due to diminished water content eid et al 2020 bare lands are often found in drought conditions characterized by reduced water content in the soil and foliage causing the index to fall towards negative values nicacias 2009 an alternating increasing and decreasing trend were observed among the positive highest ndwi values during the various years whereas the negative lowest ndwi values showed an increasing trend from one decade to the other from 1978 to 2018 the results indicate that the high moisture content denoting water body and densely vegetated landscapes observed in 1978 experienced alternating periods of decrease and increase while the non aqueous surfaces dry landscapes such as built up and bare lands showed an increasing trend over the years these trends were confirmed by the visual inspection of ndwi maps for the years 1978 1988 1998 2008 and 2018 fig 3 in which the distribution of the quantity of water pixels can be seen in these images the maximum water content highest ndwi values is denoted by the deep dark blue coloration while the minimum water content lowest ndwi values is denoted by the faded light blue coloration water bodies in a liquid form generally appear deep dark blue because they have higher reflectance on the blue 0 4 0 5 µm spectrum than the green 0 5 0 6 µm and red 0 6 0 7 µm spectrum bhatta 2011 the ndwi results generally indicate that the klvb landscape in 1978 was dominated by vegetated landscapes alongside lake victoria but these surfaces declined over time due to the increasing coverage of built up and bare lands necessitated by the expansion of urban centers or the creation of new ones the vegetation loss that occurred in the basin must have been due to the conversion of natural environments such as grasslands forests and agricultural areas to build environments such as roads pavements buildings bridges and car park lots among others all the key elements of urban expansion within the watershed over the years moreover the results show that the level of lake victoria waters has been experiencing fluctuations which can be associated with climate variability or other anthropogenic effects jalili et al 2016 this is consistent with a previous study by awange et al 2007 even though the presence of lake victoria is permanent rampant flooding in the basin and installation of various irrigation systems in agricultural landscapes swenson wahr 2009 ombogo 2016 vanderkelen et al 2018 within the basin could be contributing factors to the rise in moisture level while wetlands reclamation oroda et al 2016 and receding water levels of the lake kairu 2001 swenson wahr 2009 could have contributed to the decline in moisture levels in the klvb also the rampant drought conditions in some parts of the basin ombogo 2016 might have caused water stress on the vegetation for the last two decades alone about 62 of wetland areas around lake victoria have been converted to agricultural land isunju 2016 3 3 change detection by ndbi ndbi facilitates the mapping of broad urban land covers by highlighting built up areas at a higher degree of accuracy and objectivity xu 2008 simwanda murayama 2018 on a scale ranging from 1 to 1 whereby negative values represent water bodies positive values represents higher built up and other paved surfaces and zero value represent areas covered with vegetation he et al 2010 however xu 2008 notes that one problem of ndbi in mapping urban land covers is that it s impossible to discriminate urban industrial commercial and residential areas of the built up developing areas they all have a waterproof surface that has nearly the same reflectance andriani et al 2018 to demonstrate the evolution of built up surfaces in the klvb between the years 1978 2018 change detection through ndbi image classification was undertaken summarized results of the yearly highest and lowest ndbi values obtained are presented in table 6 the ndbi compares built up areas to surfaces covered by water bodies the results show that the positive highest ndbi values ranged between 0 60 and 0 87 which shows the existence of higher built up and other paved surfaces in the klvb throughout the period between 1978 and 2018 on the other hand the negative lowest ndbi values for the years ranged between 0 83 and 0 55 showing the existence of surfaces covered by water bodies a generally increasing trend was observed among the positive highest ndbi values during the various years whereas the negative lowest ndbi values showed an alternating increasing and decreasing trend from one decade to the other from 1978 to 2018 the results indicate that the higher built up and other paved surfaces denoting urban sprawl increasing over the years whereas the water bodies including lake victoria and wetlands experienced alternating periods of decrease and increase over the years these trends were confirmed by the visual inspection of ndbi maps for the years 1978 1988 1998 2008 and 2018 fig 4 in which the distribution of the quantity of built up pixels can be seen in these images the increasing red coloration is a proxy for the increasing intensity of urban growth in lake victoria the ndbi is multi colored with the increasing red regions denoting growth of urban development ogashawara bastos 2012 generally the results that between 1978 and 2018 the built up area had been rapidly expanding in the klvb implying intensification of urban development characterized by increasing imperviousness marginal vegetation cover and less water content sharma et al 2015 like the ndwi the ndbi showed alternating periods of decrease and increase over the years for water bodies and wetlands which could be attributed to the factors already discussed for ndwi trends unlike the ndwi the ndbi is never affected by the prevailing hydric conditions as it uses spectral bands that are found in the near infrared part of the em spectrum hence clear visibility in the results liu zhang 2011 this study found ndbi to be a reliable metric of urban development for a particular geographical location confirming the observation of earlier studies liu zhang 2011 ogashawara bastos 2012 however in acknowledging the inherent limitations of ndbi in singling out built up areas from urban areas correctly the study further employed the use of the endbi index discussed in the next section the endbi provides capabilities for accurately distinguishing built up areas from bare lands in urban areas bhatti tripathi 2014 and therefore it is a more effective metric for urban development features compared to the ndbi essentially ndbi is good but endbi is better with regards to distinctively measuring all the features of urban development 3 4 change detection by endbi in endbi the positive value denotes bare land the negative values represent the built up area and zero denotes vegetation cover bhatti tripathi 2014 this study used endbi to distinguish built up areas from bare lands in urban areas summarized results of the yearly highest and lowest endbi values obtained are presented in table 7 according to the results highest positive endbi values for the various years ranged between 0 60 and 1 04 while the lowest negative ndbi values for the different years ranged between 1 21 and 0 58 the high endbi values showed a decreasing trend whereas the low endbi values showed an increasing trend over the years these trends were confirmed by the visual inspection of endbi maps for the years 1978 1988 1998 2008 and 2018 fig 5 the endbi operates on the premise that the presence of a deep red pixel high value shows a likely occurrence of development or built up activity bhatti tripathi 2014 the trends show that as the bare lands declined the built up areas continued to rise over the years this implies that urban development has been increasing over the years especially around the shores characterized by the conversion of open areas to developed areas across the regions in klvb shadrack 2015 posited that this trend has increased over the years in the whole country with the dawn of devolved governance in kenya in 2010 which made counties the basis for development generally the ndvi indicated an intense decreasing trend in the density of vegetated landscapes three indices of ndvi ndwi and ndbi depicted fluctuations in moisture content in lake victoria and its wetlands the ndbi endbi both shown an intense increasing trend in the built up area expansion in the klvb during the period between 1978 and 2018 this finding was consistent with previous studies that observed an increasing trend of built up surfaces in klvb rakama et al 2017 these changes in built up areas suggest that urban development has been rapidly progressing within the region over the years juma et al 2014 observed that rapid population growth and socio economic development are the major drivers of urban expansion in the entire klvb according to the findings of the present study intense urbanization in this watershed has been largely concentrated on locations adjacent to the shores of lake victoria this is could be because the majority of the watershed residents are highly attracted to the areas bordering the shores providing rich and easily accessible fisheries resources fertile soils and water availability for farming practices juma et al 2014 these lucrative economic activities drive rural urban migration which in turn empowers population growth resulting in urbanization in the region ochieng et al 2013 according to kenya s commission for revenue allocation cra 2011 the population of klvb has been rapidly increasing over the years in tandem with national population growth in the country the current ecological condition of lake victoria indicates that the environmental effects of urbanization are pervasive throughout its watershed the ecological problems in the lake victoria ecosystem potentially emanating from urbanization have been well documented in the available literature the waters of lake victoria have persistently been reported over the years by various studies to be highly polluted ruhiu 2004 babu et al 2015 roegner et al 2020 according to these previous studies the sources of water pollution in the lake include nutrients and organic material loading from domestic municipal and industrial wastewater and solid waste disposal systems these pollutants are carried by the run off water and deposited into the lake increased run off arises from the extensive impervious surfaces created by the continuous urban growth and urban sprawl within the catchment pollution loading from the sprawling urban area has been established to be responsible for the infestation of harmful algal bloom and invasive species eichhornia crassipes in the lake hecky et al 2010 sitoki et al 2010 juma et al 2014 roegner et al 2020 some areas within the klvb are known to usually experience rampant catastrophic flooding juma et al 2014 periodic flooding has been reported in various regions within the lake victoria basin such as nyando kano and sondu miriu khan et al 2010 kundu olang 2011 bakibinga ibembe et al 2011 flooding events have been known to occur more frequently in highly urbanized watersheds such as the klvb this is because these areas are often characterized by extensive impervious surfaces comprising of rooftops pavements asphalt roads and parking spaces o driscoll et al 2010 which impairs rainfall water storage capacity and infiltration mechanisms leading to increased volume of storm runoff generation wenger et al 2009 the increased storm runoff volumes translate into increased occurrence and rigor of flooding catastrophes within watersheds wang et al 2011 these environmental effects of urbanization threaten the lives and livelihoods of the watershed residents for example pollution emanating from urbanization presents grave public health concerns roegner et al 2020 as well as threatening the survival of aquatic life including fish resources sitoki et al 2010 upon which the economic survival of the basin inhabitants is primarily anchored moreover voluminous amounts of run off draining from the impervious built environment of urban areas accelerate erosion from the fertile agricultural lands causing land degradation and hence reducing agricultural productivity land degradation and the subsequent reduction in agricultural productivity constitutes one of the causes of widespread poverty levels among farming communities around this region who are not actively involved in the fishing industry for some reasons including the far distance from the lake mitigating these environmental problems starts from understanding their root causes which this study has attempted to achieve 4 conclusions the change detection analysis indicated that the klvb is experiencing rapid and intense urban development characterized by declining wetlands vegetated landscapes including agricultural and forest lands and increasing barren and built up areas most of the urban development in the klvb was located around the shores of lake victoria from where they progress outwards to major administrative centers around the region a demonstration of the unplanned patterns of land usage on the environment these patterns if left uncontrolled could potentially exacerbate the current environmental problems experienced in the watershed hence there s a need for strengthening national and county urban development planning framework that strikes a balance between economic development and environmental conservation furthermore intensive and strategic planning of the already established urban areas within the watershed is recommended to realize the sustainability of other natural resources in the watershed the study concluded that the four multi spectral indices were able to correctly show the intensity and magnitude of urbanization hence they hold significant opportunities and potential in modern environmental assessments moreover a combination of the four spectral indices was found to be a better improvement when compared to the individual methods and the available ground truth data for future studies we recommend the application of machine learning based classification techniques in carrying out similar research in the klvb to see if it can yield similar results funding this study was funded by a grant provided to the first named author by the african union commission auc the funding

20052,south and southeast asia ssea is a socially economically and ecologically diverse region with a rapidly growing population and accelerating industrial development agricultural intensification using manufactured fertilizers terrestrial landscape change expansion of water engineering sewage production and land conversions nitrogen and phosphorus are major nutrients that play an essential role in the eutrophication of inland and coastal water bodies eutrophic areas when combined with appropriate coastal ocean physical conditions can develop into hypoxic zones that result in long term ecosystem disruption this study addressed changes in terrestrial nitrogen and phosphorus mobilization associated with land use transitions fertilizer use and sewage from 2002 to 2016 in the ssea region with a focus on the mekong and krishna godavari watersheds terrestrial mobilization results from the internal production or addition of reactive soluble and or plant available forms of nitrogen and phosphorus to estimate terrestrial mobilization associated with land conversion published data were mined for estimates of land cover change effects on soil carbon nitrogen and phosphorus pools data on exogenous fertilizer and sewage effluents were also compiled from the literature from the analysis it showed that fertilizer input was the largest source of nitrogen and phosphorus in both case study watersheds sewage and land conversion were not a significant source of terrestrial phosphorus mobilization in either watershed all land conversions resulted in declines in soil carbon ranging from 11 to 38 nitrogen increased on average by 15 in conversions of agricultural to urban land but decreased in all other conversions phosphorus increased by 89 in wetland to agriculture conversions but decreased between 2 and 24 for other land conversions expansion of agriculture at the expense of forest was the dominant land conversion in the mekong watershed urbanization at the expense of agriculture and forest was the dominant land conversion in the krishna godavari watershed these results suggest that management of nutrient pollution n and p in ssea will need to focus on reducing the use and or improving the efficiency of fertilizer use along with regular consolidated monitoring in both watersheds keywords south and southeast asia land conversion nitrogen phosphorus terrestrial mobilization watersheds 1 introduction human activities during the past century have greatly altered the cycling of nutrients in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems ciais et al 2013 these activities have doubled the natural annual rate at which nitrogen enters the land based nitrogen cycle and this is likely to increase further in the future vitousek et al 1997 galloway et al 2004 howarth 2008 the global phosphorus cycle has also been substantially altered as phosphorus mining and subsequent use as fertilizer have more than doubled natural phosphorus inputs to the

severe hypoxic or dead zones that result in long term ecosystem disruption diaz and rosenberg 2008 glibert et al 2010 bailey et al 2020 global changes in nitrogen and phosphorus use are primarily driven by the need for food production increases in world food production in recent decades have been facilitated by increases in the amount of land under cultivation and irrigation aquastat 2014 fao 2017 iwmi 2017 but arguably as importantly by increases in the use of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers lambin et al 2003 sutton et al 2013 lu and hanqin 2017 increases in the amount of land under cultivation have come from the conversion of forest lands and wetlands to agricultural lands which can result in mobilization and loss of nutrients stored in soils and vegetation schneider et al 2017 terrestrial mobilization is defined as the internal production or addition of reactive soluble and or plant available forms of nitrogen and phosphorus to a watershed this term thus encompasses nutrients converted from non reactive to reactive forms by land disturbance as well as fertilizer and manure additions and sewage production in addition to the mobilization of nutrients stored in soils and vegetation the uptake efficiency of fertilizer use on agricultural lands is relatively low e g crops typically take up only 40 50 of the total organic and inorganic n added during each cropping season bleken and bakken 1997 sutton et al 2013 while the use of fertilizers supports plant growth it imbalances the nutrient budget raaijmakers et al 2009 gordon et al 2008 creating a high potential for export to surrounding ecosystems that include rivers lakes streams and coastal zones seitzinger et al 2010 leach et al 2012 fao 2017 conversion of native ecosystems forests and wetlands to agricultural or urban land perturbs ecosystem processes and can influence stocks and fluxes of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus the dominant global land use change has been the clearance of forest and other native ecosystems for agricultural use levy et al 2004 converting natural ecosystems to cultivated agriculture has been shown to result in losses of 20 50 of the soil c stock in the topmost meter of the soil and losses of nitrogen and phosphorus associated with this soil carbon are also considerable berihu et al 2016 fao 2007 similarly wetlands are declining globally as a result of land conversion in some regions of the world more than 50 of peatlands marshes riparian zones lake littoral zones and floodplains have been lost primarily due to conversion to agriculture mitsch and gosselink 2000 clarkson et al 2013 as with forests these conversions result in mobilization and loss of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus moreover wetlands provide critical ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling water quality improvement water storage flood abatement and habitat provision zedler and kercher 2005 kumari et al 2020 in particular wetlands remove significant quantities of nitrogen via denitrification hunt et al 2014 these ecosystem services are lost when wetlands are converted or changed to other ecosystems zedler 2003 russi et al 2013 an additional significant land change is the conversion of agricultural or native ecosystems to urban land grimm et al 2008b these conversions are caused by the relatively higher value associated with urban compared to agricultural

tropics and its geography and climate support a high biodiversity of plants and animals one of the main geographical characteristics of this region is that it contains some of the world s largest river delta systems including the mekong south east asia brahmaputra meghna india and bangladesh and krishna godavari india ericson et al 2006 population growth and urbanization have caused enormous pressure to convert land from natural and agricultural areas into residential and urban uses with significant impacts on ecosystem services justice et al 2015 viewed within a historical context asia has experienced dramatic land transformations and has the highest deforestation rate of any major tropical region mainly for cash crop such as palm oil and agriculture zhao et al 2006 wilcove et al 2013 although land use change occurs at the local level it impacts human societies across regional and global scales as well zhao et al 2006 this study examined land transformations in the ssea region along with fertilizer and sewage inputs and how these have mobilized terrestrial nutrients specifically nitrogen and phosphorus that can then be transported to coastal ecosystems given the rapid rise of population and urban development across the region it is important to understand links between conditions and trajectories of land cover change and subsequent impacts on coastal ecosystems two watersheds the mekong and krishna godavari were selected as focal points for this study these watersheds provide excellent contrast between different types and rates of land use change the study addressed the following research questions a what is the nature and extent of land conversion in the study area over the past 20 years b how have land changes altered nitrogen and phosphorus stored in soils over this time period c which land conversions have the biggest effects on nitrogen and phosphorus storage in soils and thus the potentially largest impact on the transfer of these nutrients to coastal waters d how does terrestrial nutrient mobilization associated with land conversion compare with fertilizer inputs and sewage production as possible sources of nitrogen and phosphorus to coastal waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview data on the area of land converted from one land cover to another between 2002 and 2016 was produced by collaborators on a nasa funded research project entitled coastal hypoxia analysis and risk tracking chart through remote sensing and process based modeling the change in area for forest conversion to agriculture land wetland conversion to agriculture land forest conversion to urban area and agriculture land conversion to urban area were estimated using time series analysis of modis data tang et al 2019 tang et al 2020 tang et al 2021 then data were mined from the literature on soil carbon nitrogen and phosphorus pools associated with different land covers across the region including for agriculture forest urban and wetland we had a particular focus on studies that included detailed and controlled analysis on the effects of conversion from one land cover to another on these pools these data on soil pools of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus and the changes in those pools with land conversion were then combined with the areal estimates of land cover change to calculate the total terrestrial carbon nitrogen and phosphorus mobilization associated with land conversion in these study regions data on fertilizer input of nitrogen and phosphorus for the study watersheds were taken from compilations produced by the united nations food and agricultural organization food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2020 these compilations include data on nitrogen fertilizer in the form of nh3 and phosphorus fertilizer in the form of p2o5 they also compile data on nitrogen in manure applied to agricultural land and the amount of this manure nitrogen that leaches from soil these data were combined with estimates of the area of agricultural land in these watersheds to estimate the total nitrogen and phosphorus mobilization by fertilizer inputs from 2002 to 2016 estimates of nitrogen and phosphorus mobilization associated with sewage and detergent use were made by combining estimates of sewage human emission rates for nitrogen and phosphorus with estimates of the total population for both study regions van drecht et al 2009 2 2 case study watersheds the analysis focused on two watersheds in ssea the mekong and the krishna godavari the mekong river basin covers a total area of 795 000 km2

dependent on it for their subsistence through the provision of inland fisheries agriculture tourism and hydropower campbell 2009 mrc 2019 the godavari river is the second largest river in india with a catchment area of 312 812 km2 and a long term average annual surface flow of 110 km3 fig 4 it originates near trimbak in nashik district of maharashtra state and flows east across the deccan plateau into the bay of bengal near narasapuram in west godavari district of andhra pradesh the number of dams constructed in the godavari basin is the highest among all river basins in india padmavathi et al 2019 the krishna river basin is the fourth largest in india with a total catchment area of 258 948 km2 and a long term average annual surface flow of 78 km3 amarasinghe et al 2005 the krishna godavari delta on the east coast of india comprises two separate areas built by processes in the two corresponding river systems although the deltas of these two rivers have coalesced to appear as a single physiographic unit the delta has significant economic e g aquaculture and ecological e g mangroves resources rao 1985 2 3 data collection the research questions about how land transformations in ssea have mobilized terrestrial nutrients were addressed by gathering and analyzing literature data fig 2 the data sets used included published articles and international and national reports on fertilizer use sewage inputs land use and land cover change and its effects on soil carbon nitrogen and phosphorus dynamics in the ssea region for the literature search a wide range of online databases and publishing groups such as google scholar researchgate jstor science direct elsevier etc were used some papers that were not available directly from online databases were obtained from the authors upon request appendix a 2 4 statistical analysis estimates from the literature required harmonization to facilitate their synthesis different studies reported changes in soil carbon nitrogen and phosphorus in different units to different depth or mass of soil and dealt with soil weight and density in different ways all data were ultimately converted into the common unit of kg n or p per ha variation among studies in the time since ecosystems had been converted represents a significant source of variation and uncertainty in the analysis data on soil bulk density weight volume are essential for calculating quantities of soil nitrogen carbon and phosphorus for studies that did not report bulk density estimates were calculated based on soil texture information provided in the recent literature zeri et al 2018 the depth to which soil samples were taken varied from 10 to 800 cm to facilitate comparison across studies the shallowest sampling depths were used e g 0 15 cm if the sampling depths were provided when the results were given in percentage change for carbon nitrogen and phosphorus data on bulk density and depth were used to calculate soil mass and were combined with concentration data to produce estimates of soil carbon nitrogen and phosphorus in kg per ha pribyl 2010 data from the literature were compiled and used to compare estimate changes in soil nitrogen phosphorus and carbon pools for the following land conversions forest to agriculture forest to urban agriculture to urban wetland to agriculture these estimates were then combined with areal estimates of these land conversions derived from remote sensing by tang et al 2021 to establish the quantities of soil nitrogen phosphorus and carbon mobilized by the conversions three different approaches were used to calculate the quantities of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus mobilized by land conversions 1 comparison of mean values for different land use types based on all studies 2 comparison of mean values from all studies with outlier values three standard deviations above the mean removed and 3 comparison of mean values only from studies that had controlled comparisons of different land uses data on fertilizer inputs and sewage production in the watersheds were also assembled and compared with the land conversion effects fig 2 3 results 3 1 land conversion effects on carbon nitrogen and phosphorus a total of 76 papers were collected from the literature search for land conversion effects on carbon nitrogen and phosphorus appendix a we calculated the mean standard deviation standard error and data counts for soil carbon nitrogen and phosphorus pools in each land use type table 1 and produced frequency distribution histograms showing outliers values more than three standard deviations away from the mean fig 5 comparison of the mean values for all forest agriculture urban and wetland soil values shows a decrease in carbon nitrogen and phosphorus for all conversions except conversion of forest to agricultural lands which showed increases in carbon and nitrogen fig 6 comparison of the mean values for all forest agriculture urban and wetland soil following removal of values more than three standard deviation from mean shows similar patterns with some variable effect on nitrogen fig 7 a more restricted comparison that includes only studies that made direct comparisons between different land use types showed a narrower range of effects here all conversions resulted in the loss of soil carbon with variable effects on nitrogen and phosphorus fig 8 this approach also allows for calculation of the variance of change as the estimate is the product of 72 direct comparisons rather than subtraction of two mean values 3 2 land conversions in studied watersheds estimates of the extent of land conversions for the time period from 2002 to 2016 were derived from remote sensing provided by tang et al 2021 all of our estimates of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus change including those associated with fertilizer and sewage are benchmarked to this period the land change analysis includes three types of forest evergreen forest deciduous and mixed wetlands are categorized as either mangrove or flooded forest agriculture land is categorized as rice paddy plantation cropland and aquaculture land conversion was more active in the mekong compared to the krishna godavari watershed in the mekong watershed over 16 000 km2 of land was converted from 2002 to 2016 which accounts for 2 from the total watershed area table 2 this change was dominated by conversion of 13 025 km2 of forest into agricultural land followed by 1981 km2 converted from wetland to agriculture 885 km2 converted from agricultural to urban land and 185 km2 converted from forest into urban land more changes were detected in the lower basin of the region than the upper basin fig 9 in the krishna godavari watershed over 2380 km2 of land was converted between 2002 and 2016 which accounts for 0 7 of the total watershed area table 3 this change was dominated by conversion of agriculture to urban land 2249 km2 followed by conversion of forest to urban land 88 km2 and conversion of forest to agriculture 44 km2 no conversion of wetland to agriculture was detected in this region fig 10 3 3 estimates of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus mobilized by land conversion the values derived from the mean change in soil carbon nitrogen and phosphorus pools based on studies that made direct comparisons between different land use types were combined with estimates of the area of different conversions for the mekong table 2 and krishna godavari table 3 watersheds in the mekong watershed the expansion of agriculture at the expense of forest was the dominant land conversion however conversion of wetlands to agriculture mobilized the most terrestrial carbon i e 5 93 1010 kg followed by conversion of forest to agriculture which mobilized 2 89 1010 kg of terrestrial carbon conversion of forests to agriculture mobilized 3 26 109 kg of terrestrial nitrogen in the mekong followed by conversion of wetlands to agriculture which mobilized 2 64 109 kg of terrestrial nitrogen conversion of forests to agriculture and urban land mobilized phosphorus while conversion of wetlands to agriculture increased phosphorus stored in the soil in the mekong watershed table 2 urbanization was the largest land conversion in the krishna godavari watershed with urban land increasing at the expense of agriculture and forest only small areas of forest were converted to agriculture and there was no evidence of conversion of wetlands to agriculture conversion of agriculture to urban land mobilized 9 76 108 kg of terrestrial carbon whereas conversion of agriculture to urban increased soil nitrogen stocks in the krishna godavari watershed forest conversion to agriculture land mobilized 4 94 105 kg of terrestrial phosphorus in this watershed followed by the conversion of agriculture to urban land which mobilized 3 37 105 kg of terrestrial phosphorus no terrestrial mobilization of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus was detected for wetland to agriculture conversions table 3 3 4 fertilizer and sewage inputs total fertilizer inputs 2002 2016 averaged 1 21 109 kg yr of nitrogen and 5 85 108 kg yr of phosphorus in the mekong watershed table 4 and 3 56 109 kg yr of nitrogen and 1 45 109 kg yr of phosphorus in the krishna godavari watershed table 5 these inputs increased from 2002 to 2016 in both watersheds with more variability from year to year in the mekong watershed and a greater rate of increase in the krishna godavari fig 11 and fig 12 we estimated the total n and p emission from sewage by multiplying average p and n kg person year derived from van drecht et al 2009 by population estimates for the years 2002 2008 and 2016 government of india 2001 2011 mrc 2019 we also calculated point source and non point sources of sewage input for nitrogen and phosphorus based on information obtained from unicef and world health organization 2015 mrc 2019 total sewage nitrogen emissions 2002 2016 averaged 2 43 108 kg yr for the mekong and 5 93 108 kg yr in the krishna godavari total sewage phosphorus emissions including phosphorus inputs associated with detergent emissions were estimated as 4 09 107 kg yr in the mekong and 1 0 108 kg yr in the krishna godavari from 2002 to 2016 the population of the lower mekong region increased from 53 million to 65 million people similarly the population of the krishna godavari watershed increased from 130 million to 160 million over this same time period these population increases and increasing human nitrogen and phosphorus emissions rates have increased sewage and detergent inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus in both watersheds table 6 table 7 to estimate point and non point sources it was necessary to split the total nitrogen and phosphorus emissions from sewage into urban sewered urban unsewered rural sewered and rural unsewered populations in the mekong basin about 80 of the population lives in rural and 20 live in urban areas mrc 2019 while in the krishna godavari region half of the population lives in rural areas government of india 2011 the urban sanitation of the countries in the mekong basin has improved from 1990 to 2015 such that more than 90 percent of the urban population uses improved sanitation facilities and 65 percent of the rural population uses improved sanitation facilities similarly in india around 63 percent of the urban population uses improved sanitation facilities while only 28 percent of the rural population uses improved sanitation facilities improved sanitation facilities include flushed and septic systems and piped sewage lines in contrast to open defecation and shared or mixed unimproved sanitation facilities unicef and world health organization 2015 we assumed that improved sanitation facilities produce point sources and that other sanitation are non point sources of sewage we estimated point sources urban and rural combined of sewage as 1 72 108 kg yr and 2 7 108 kg yr of nitrogen for the mekong and krishna godavari watershed region respectively we estimate non point urban and rural combined sources of sewage as 7 107 kg yr and 3 2 108 kg yr of nitrogen for mekong and krishna godavari watershed region respectively tables 8 and 9 fertilizer was the largest source of terrestrial nitrogen and phosphorus mobilization in both watersheds in the mekong watershed nitrogen fertilizer accounted for 66 of input followed by land conversion 21 and sewage 13 fig 13 table 10 fertilizer accounted for 93 of terrestrial phosphorus mobilization and sewage represented 7 in the mekong land conversions did not contribute to mobilization of phosphorus in this watershed fertilizer was even more dominant in the krishna godavari fig 14 table 10 accounting for 85 and 94 of terrestrial nitrogen and phosphorus mobilization respectively sewage accounted for 14 of nitrogen and 6 of phosphorus in the krishna godavari land conversion was not a significant source for either nitrogen or phosphorus mobilization in the krishna godavari watershed 4 discussion 4 1 the importance of land conversion for terrestrial carbon nitrogen and phosphorus mobilization land use change such as the conversion of forest to agricultural use alters soil physical chemical and biological properties these changes are driven by alteration of the quality and quantity of nutrient inputs to and losses from the soil and by stimulation of decomposition through soil disturbance murty et al 2002 forest trees remove significant amounts of carbon from the atmosphere keenan and williams 2018 carbon in plant materials enters the soil through above ground litterfall root and mycorrhizal turnover and carbon exudation from roots carfdon 1996 feller and beare 1997 heterophic respiration by decomposers of litter and soil organic matter returns some soil carbon to atmosphere while other fractions of the carbon are transformed into stable organic complexes or humus aber and melillo 1991 this terrestrial carbon and the nitrogen and phosphorus associated with this carbon can be mobilized and lost from the ecosystem when humans convert the forest into other ecosystems such as agriculture our analysis here shows that land conversion has mobilized important quantities of terrestrial carbon nitrogen and phosphorus in the highly dynamic ssea region however our analysis suggests that these quantities are small relative to nutrient inputs associated with fertilizer use especially for nitrogen and particularly in the krishna godavari watershed our results are consistent with studies conducted around the world on land conversions and its effect on soil carbon and nitrogen in northeastern costa rica powers and s 2004 found that conversion of forests to bananas decreased soil c concentrations in the surface soil by 37 percent in ethiopia berihu et al 2016 found that conversion of natural ecosystems to cultivated agriculture resulted in losses of between 20 and 50 percent of the soil c stocks in the first meter of the soil in the southern united states zhang et al 2012 showed that while urbanization initially caused a decline in soil carbon storage established urban areas may gradually accumulate carbon over time in iran mahrer et al 2014 found that conversion of forest to tea garden decreased the soil carbon to nitrogen and carbon to phosphorus ratios but increased soil organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorus content in mexico anaya et al 2015 found that conversion of tropical forest to traditional sugarcane agriculture reduced soil carbon and nitrogen by 25 percent at 0 10 cm depth after 20 years of cultivation compared after 50 years of cultivation carbon stocks were similar in sugarcane and forest plots while soil n stocks remained 12 19 lower in sugarcane than in forest plots over 0 20 cm 4 2 the quantities of terrestrial carbon nitrogen and phosphorus mobilized by land conversions three approaches were used to calculate the effect of land conversions on the mobilization of terrestrial carbon nitrogen and phosphorous in the first approach we compared means for different land use types based on all studies that we were able to compile from the literature fig 6 this approach showed an unexpected steep increase about 316 in soil carbon when forests were converted to agriculture this increase was mainly driven by high estimates for wetland conversion to agricultural land for other land conversions in this analysis of all studies carbon decreases ranged from 73 to 93 similarly soil nitrogen pools increased by 17 in the forest to agriculture conversion but decreased from 23 to 87 in other ecosystem conversions there was no change in mean phosphorus in the forest to agriculture conversion for all other conversions phosphorus decreased from 73 to 90 the increase in soil carbon with the conversion of forest to agriculture that we observed with our first approach was unexpected because many studies around the world have shown decreases in soil carbon when forests are converted to agriculture piao et al 2012 schlesinger and bernhardt 2013 for example houghton 2002 and hergoualc h and verchot 2011 observed significant decreases in carbon storage with forest to agricultural conversions in tropical asia including ssea kaul et al 2009 found a similar decrease in soil carbon with forest to agriculture conversions in india murty et al 2002 found losses of 24 for carbon and 15 for nitrogen in a study of tropical forest converted to agricultural land similarly a study conducted by sharma et al 2019 using multitemporal satellite data in semiarid region of rajasthan india from 2003 to 2014 found conversion of forest to agricultural land led to loss of carbon the increases in soil nitrogen and phosphorus when forests and wetlands were converted to agricultural land that we observed were not unexpected because of fertilizer inputs to agricultural land the decrease in soil nitrogen when forests and agriculture were converted to urban land likely depends on just what the urban land is being used for and the nutrient inputs that are associated with that use e g urban gardens versus residential or commercial areas the second approach to calculating terrestrial mobilization associated with land conversion compared mean values from all studies with outlier values removed fig 7 extreme values were particularly important for wetland conversions this approach still showed an unexpected increase in carbon associated with forest to agriculture conversions 150 but showed decreases in carbon from 68 to 95 for all other conversions nitrogen decreased for the wetland to agriculture and agriculture to urban conversions by 91 and 10 respectively but increased from 27 to 42 in all other conversions phosphorus decreased in all conversions from 2 to 84 the third approach to calculation of mobilization of terrestrial carbon nitrogen and phosphorus associated with land conversion was a comparison limited to studies that had controlled comparisons of different land uses fig 8 this approach showed decreases in carbon in all conversions from 11 to 38 a smaller range than observed with the two other approaches nitrogen increased by 15 in agriculture to urban conversions but decreased in all other ecosystem conversions there was a significant increase in phosphorus 89 for the wetland to agriculture conversion for other conversions phosphorus decreased from 2 to 24 the declines in both nitrogen and phosphorus in the forest to agriculture conversion suggest that the loss of nutrients associated with soil carbon was a more important driver than fertilizer input in these conversions these results are consistent with prasad et al 1995 who also found a reduction of total nitrogen 26 35 and total phosphorus by 33 44 with the conversion of forest to cropland in eastern india 4 3 estimates of terrestrial nutrients mobilized by land conversions at the watershed scale we used results from the third approach i e comparison of mean values from studies that had controlled comparisons of different land uses to produce estimates of terrestrial carbon nitrogen and phosphorus mobilized by land conversion in the mekong and krishna godavari watersheds we used the results from this approach because they were less affected by extreme values and were less variable than results from the other approaches moreover results from this approach were consistent with other studies and with general principles of how land conversion should affect soil nutrient stocks in the mekong watershed conversion of forest to agriculture land was the dominant conversion accounting for 81 of the total converted land area conversion of agriculture to urban land accounted for 6 of converted land 12 of the converted area was from wetland to agriculture land and only 1 of the converted area was from forest to urban land multiplying the average values for carbon nitrogen and phosphorus change with conversion by the estimates of the converted area suggests that on average 5 92 109 kg yr of terrestrial carbon and 3 87 108 kg yr of terrestrial nitrogen was mobilized in the mekong watershed from 2002 to 2016 on average 5 59 107 kg yr of terrestrial phosphorus accumulated in the soil over this same time period mostly as a result of conversions to agricultural land in the krishna godavari watershed the conversion of agricultural land to urban land accounted for 94 of the converted area conversion of forests to urban land accounted for 4 of land change and conversion from forest to agriculture accounted for 2 of change no conversions from wetlands to agriculture were reported in this watershed these conversions mobilized an average of 7 80 107 kg yr of terrestrial carbon and 7 47 104 kg yr of terrestrial phosphorus from 2002 to 2016 whereas 2 02 107 yr kg of terrestrial nitrogen accumulated in soils in urban areas over this same period 4 4 the importance of fertilizer inputs fertilizer was the largest source of nitrogen and phosphorus added to both the mekong and krishna godavari watersheds fertilizer accounted for an average of 1 2 109 kg yr of nitrogen and 5 85 108 kg yr of phosphorus in the mekong watershed and 3 56 109 kg yr of nitrogen and 1 45 109 kg yr of phosphorus in the krishna godavari from 2002 to 2016 these results are consistent with the study done by pedde et al 2017 who found that fertilizers and manure were the two largest sources 32 and 26 respectively of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din eventually delivered by rivers draining into the bay of bengal large marine ecosystem the importance of fertilizer as a source of mobile nutrients in these watersheds figs 11 and 12 is likely to continue to increase in the next few years and decades the world demand for total fertilizer nutrients grew at 2 0 percent per annum from 2011 to 2015 and asia is now the largest consumer of fertilizer in the world total fertilizer nutrient consumption in asia is 60 percent of the world s total and south asia is the second largest fertilizer consuming region in the world fao 2011 declining yield response to fertilizer a major concern in south asian agriculture systems mujeri et al 2013 and could be driver of increases in fertilizer intensity at the same time there is interest in increasing fertilizer use efficiency nue which is defined as the biomass productivity per unit fertilizer applied ortiz monasterio et al 2001 there are several strategies for improving fertilizer use efficiency such as integrated nutrient management improved fertilizer application methods green manuring use of slow release fertilizers and or nitrification inhibitors crop rotation conservation agriculture crop residue management and precision farming raghavendra et al 2020 agricultural land in both watershed regions is managed primarily by small and marginal agricultural households ingalls et al 2018 who generally have a higher intensity of nitrogen fertilizer use pani et al 2021 farmers in the south and southeast asian regions are usually not aware of the nutrient needs of their crops or the current status of their soils for appropriate fertilization there is a strong need to increase awareness and knowledge among farmers about soil health and to provide advice training on applying fertilizer in the right amount at the right time and rate this can be accomplished by strengthening and enhancing extension services related to fertilizer integrated nutrient management and other agricultural inputs to farmers there is also a strong need to clarify fertilizer subsidy policies and to harmonize these policies with a framework that emphasizes efficiency mujeri et al 2013 4 5 the importance of sewage production and other possible sources of nitrogen and phosphorus the krishna godavari basin supports a population of more than 160 million persons government of india 2011 and 90 of the total water available from the krishna river is used for irrigation gaur et al 2007 the lower mekong river basin lmb is a diverse region with approximately 65 million people mrc 2019 on an average per day each person in these basins produces 70 100 l of sewage or wastewater and treatment of this waste is minimal mitra 2014 it is estimated that 90 of the wastewater in developing countries is discharged untreated into waterways and coastal areas boblme 2015 wwap 2017 sewage is particularly important for nitrogen and phosphorus mobilization because about 80 of total human n excretion and 62 of total human p excretion are in urine similarly 20 of human nitrogen and 38 of human phosphorus are in feces roy 2017 simha et al 2017 puijenbroek et al 2019 mihelcicet al 2011 thus sewage represents a particularly mobile source of nutrients that are readily transportable to coastal waters in southern asia where 44 of the population still practice open defecation unicef and world health organization 2015 the proportion of people using improved sanitation is increasing except in india where the number of people without improved sanitation facilities is increasing unicef and world health organization 2015 sewage discharge to surface waters in the region is expected to increase substantially between 2020 and 2050 from the combined impact of increasing population urbanization and provision of sewers puijenbroek et al 2019 the development of sewage systems will increase both the amount and nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in sewage water van drecht et al 2009 sewage nutrient content is also affected by diet increases in purchasing power which are expected in the ssea region lead to increases in food protein consumption and associated human n emission union bank of switzerland 2006 there is a clear need for continued monitoring and analysis of how changes in treatment and diet will affect nutrient loads from sewage in these watersheds mccarty 2018 huyen and lai 2019 puijenbroek et al 2019 recent case studies in south east asia have shown that revenues from wastewater by products such as fertilizer are significantly higher than the operational costs of wastewater systems these studies provide evidence that resource re use and recovery from wastewater is a viable and profit producing business model sengupta et al 2015 wwap 2017 vanotti et al 2020 managing wastewater and capturing its resource benefits such as recovery of phosphorus and nitrogen ito and funamizu 2019 can thus add significant new value streams to improve overall economic social and environmental health of the region wwap 2017 4 6 integrating and comparing different sources ssea is a rapidly developing region with dynamic changes occurring in the various sectoral drivers pressures and sources that drive nutrient enrichment and consequent potential eutrophication the key sectors include agriculture aquaculture wastewater management and fertilizer production model studies indicate that globally roughly equal amounts of reactive n reach the oceans from fertilizer manure and atmospheric deposition with smaller fractions from sewage seitzinger et al 2010 these results are consistent with our results which showed that fertilizer was the most important source of reactive n and p notably previous studies have not evaluated the importance of land conversion as a source of terrestrial nitrogen and phosphorus mobilization in coastal watersheds for the mekong watershed the sources of nitrogen are more varied than in the krishna godavari watershed because land conversion is more active in this watershed according to liljeström et al 2012 the majority of the lower mekong basin nitrogen flux originates from agricultural areas 53 followed by forest and woods and shrubland areas 39 for phosphorus flux the figures are 75 and 21 respectively these results are consistent with this study which found that 66 of terrestrial nitrogen mobilized in the mekong region was from fertilizer input with the rest associated with land conversion 21 and sewage inputs 13 for the krishna godavari watershed terrestrial nitrogen mobilized by fertilizer input was much higher 85 followed by sewage 14 and land conversions 1 fertilizer inputs contribute more than 93 of the terrestrial phosphorus mobilization in both the mekong and krishna godavari watersheds sewage was a small contributor for both watersheds about 7 of phosphorus for the mekong region and approximately 6 of phosphorus for the krishna godavari watersheds land conversion does not appear to be a significant source of terrestrial phosphorus mobilization in either watershed although land conversion was not a dominant source of terrestrial mobilization of nitrogen and phosphorus when compared to fertilizer in the long term conversion of forests and wetlands to agriculture and urban will increase fertilizer use and sewage production we estimate that on average 4 13 109 kg yr of nitrogen and 1 55 109 kg yr of phosphorus were mobilized in the krishna godavari watershed and that an average of 1 83 109 kg yr of terrestrial nitrogen and 5 90 108 kg yr of terrestrial phosphorus were mobilized in the mekong watershed from 2002 to 2016 it is important to note that nitrogen has numerous forms and transformations that vary over time and space wollheim et al 2008 here we focused on total nitrogen tn without considering different forms of this nitrogen e g inorganic versus organic dissolved versus particulate it is also important to note that our estimates of terrestrial mobilization of nitrogen are not equivalent to inflow into the coastal region due to multiple potential sinks between the land and sea including denitrification the microbial conversion of reactive nitrogen into nitrogen gases plant and microbial uptake and sedimentation these processes vary with temperature precipitation water residence times soil characteristics and river network geomorphology wollheim et al 2006 wollheim et al 2008 boyer et al 2002 the mekong river is experiencing rapid development with plans in place for the construction of 77 hydropower projects in the basin by 2030 baran et al 2015 similarly there are numerous dams and reservoirs in the krishna godavari river mainly used for irrigation power diversion or storage purpose kakani et al 2010 the current dams and future projects will have a substantial impact on the quality and quantity of terrestrial nitrogen and phosphorus that reaches coastal regions maavara et al 2020 lanza 2011 several other studies have observed significant quantities of nitrogen and phosphorus in the mekong and krishna godavari watersheds bhalla and waykar 2012 found that the concentrations of nitrate and phosphate were highest in the godavari river in winter followed by summer and were lowest in the monsoon season with an average of 1 35 mg l of nitrate and 0 93 mg l of phosphate modi et al 2017 found an average nitrate concentration of 8 44 mg l in a range of water samples from the krishna and godavari rivers krishna et al 2016 estimated that 8 06 107 kg of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din and 3 12 107 kg of phosphate are exported to the bay of bengal by the krishna godavari river annually the bay of bengal receives around 9 109 n kg year 1 through major indian rivers singh and ramesh 2011 many other studies have quantified din levels in indian rivers and while these waters are mostly safe for consumption except in areas where urban and industrial wastes are released verma et al 2012 chauhan and sagar 2013 mallika et al 2015 jamwal et al 2015 the levels are still high enough to be of concern for eutrophication moreover reports suggest that nitrate pollution of ground waters is increasing in several areas in india rao et al 2017 but the importance of groundwater discharge of nutrients into coastal regions is unclear moore 1997 subramanian 2008 somayajulu 2008 in the lower mekong river nitrate nitrate concentrations were 0 23 mg l in 2000 and 0 29 mg l in 2016 and 0 32 mg l in 2017 was recorded mrc 2019 between 2000 and 2017 total phosphorus concentrations in the lower mekong river increased slightly from 0 058 mg l in 2000 to 0 09 mg l in 2017 mrc 2019 in spite of the multiple pressures from point and non point sources of pollution studies show that the mekong mainstream was less polluted than its tributaries chea et al 2016 mrc 2005 mrc 2019 the growing and urbanizing population accelerating land use changes and increasing economic activity will likely interact to increase nutrient effects on coastal ecosystems in both the mekong and krishna godavari regions agricultural land across the lower mekong region increased by more than 9 million hectares or around 21 percent between 1996 and 2015 the increase in agricultural land increases the demand for and use of fertilizer ingalls et al 2018 for the countries of the ssea region agriculture remains the major source of livelihood with fertilizer input being the most important contributor to nutrient pollution fao 2019 fao 2011b terrestrial fluxes of nutrients from rivers to the coastal zone can contribute to the development of eutrophic and hypoxic conditions in ssea coastal waters satpathy et al 2013 with potentially significant socioeconomic impacts as many of the basin s inhabitants depend heavily on coastal resources for food and economic security liljeström et al 2012 the regions will also face many challenges in terms of sustainable development of agriculture because of increasing involvement in international trade and declines in the availability of agricultural labor and arable land szudy 2015 in addition land degradation and reduction in water availability as a result of climate change and natural disasters will affect the agricultural system in future atapattu and kodituwakku 2009 these changes will have complex effects on the relationships between land use and water quality across ssea 5 limitations of the study while our analysis has produced clear information on sources of terrestrial nutrient mobilization in the study watersheds there are several critical uncertainties data availability in the region is limited especially for land cover change and its effect on nutrients in wetlands and urban areas across the region detailed estimates of total nutrient loads from different sectors such as agriculture sewage or industry are not available or if available quite limited a major source of information is through international research projects and donor organization reports fao who mrc etc there is a clear need for further research on the areal extent and the nutrient dynamics of these ssea ecosystems yet there is limited research on these topics in the region data availability varies markedly across the region india has relatively more data and information compared to other ssea countries so the analysis of land conversion effects largely emphasizes results from india industrial operations which were not addressed in this study also release effluents that add to the nutrient budget of the coastal areas and are another possible source that is likely to increase in the future iarc 2010 even within the detailed studies variability in sampling depth and measurements of bulk density may produce errors in results dependence on the internet for reports and technical papers and the vast literature that had to be combined to filter relevant data were also major constraints of this study 6 conclusions evaluating the effects of land conversion on terrestrial nutrient mobilization is challenging restricted comparisons that include only studies that make direct controlled comparisons between different land uses are most useful but are rare still our analysis showed that all conversions resulted in the loss of soil carbon with variable effects on nitrogen and phosphorus the expansion of agriculture at the expense of forest was the dominant land conversion in the mekong watershed whereas urbanization was the largest land conversion in the krishna godavari watershed with urban land increasing at the expense of agriculture and forest land conversion is a significant source of terrestrial nitrogen mobilization in the mekong watershed where land use change is active fertilizer was the largest source of nitrogen and phosphorus added to both watersheds sewage was an important source of nitrogen in both watersheds and its direct addition to water bodies may increase the negative impact of this source on receiving waters these results suggest that management of coastal hypoxia in ssea will need to focus on reducing the use and or improving the efficiency of fertilizer use along with consolidated monitoring efforts from all countries regions linked with the watershed regions management of sewage will be an important but complex challenge improvements in the collection and treatment of human waste are likely in the region but the effects of these improvements on nutrient delivery to coastal waters will depend on whether nutrient removal tertiary treatment is a component of that treatment mccarty 2018 ongoing land conversions and nutrients inputs throughout these regions are a current challenge and will remain so for future generations addressing these challenges will require improved documentation and study which to date has been limited declaration of competing interest

20052,south and southeast asia ssea is a socially economically and ecologically diverse region with a rapidly growing population and accelerating industrial development agricultural intensification using manufactured fertilizers terrestrial landscape change expansion of water engineering sewage production and land conversions nitrogen and phosphorus are major nutrients that play an essential role in the eutrophication of inland and coastal water bodies eutrophic areas when combined with appropriate coastal ocean physical conditions can develop into hypoxic zones that result in long term ecosystem disruption this study addressed changes in terrestrial nitrogen and phosphorus mobilization associated with land use transitions fertilizer use and sewage from 2002 to 2016 in the ssea region with a focus on the mekong and krishna godavari watersheds terrestrial mobilization results from the internal production or addition of reactive soluble and or plant available forms of nitrogen and phosphorus to estimate terrestrial mobilization associated with land conversion published data were mined for estimates of land cover change effects on soil carbon nitrogen and phosphorus pools data on exogenous fertilizer and sewage effluents were also compiled from the literature from the analysis it showed that fertilizer input was the largest source of nitrogen and phosphorus in both case study watersheds sewage and land conversion were not a significant source of terrestrial phosphorus mobilization in either watershed all land conversions resulted in declines in soil carbon ranging from 11 to 38 nitrogen increased on average by 15 in conversions of agricultural to urban land but decreased in all other conversions phosphorus increased by 89 in wetland to agriculture conversions but decreased between 2 and 24 for other land conversions expansion of agriculture at the expense of forest was the dominant land conversion in the mekong watershed urbanization at the expense of agriculture and forest was the dominant land conversion in the krishna godavari watershed these results suggest that management of nutrient pollution n and p in ssea will need to focus on reducing the use and or improving the efficiency of fertilizer use along with regular consolidated monitoring in both watersheds keywords south and southeast asia land conversion nitrogen phosphorus terrestrial mobilization watersheds 1 introduction human activities during the past century have greatly altered the cycling of nutrients in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems ciais et al 2013 these activities have doubled the natural annual rate at which nitrogen enters the land based nitrogen cycle and this is likely to increase further in the future vitousek et al 1997 galloway et al 2004 howarth 2008 the global phosphorus cycle has also been substantially altered as phosphorus mining and subsequent use as fertilizer have more than doubled natural phosphorus inputs to the environment mackenzie et al 1998 bennett et al 2001 fixen and west 2002 bindraban et al 2020 nitrogen and phosphorus diffusion from land to receiving waters can result in eutrophication beusen et al 2016 moal et al 2019 which refers to a suite of negative changes in coastal ecosystems including algal blooms alterations in community composition production of toxic algae hypoxic or anoxic conditions and increased turbidity livingston 1996 kemp et al 2009 glibert et al 2010 glibert et al 2014 eutrophic areas when combined with appropriate physical water conditions can develop into severe hypoxic or dead zones that result in long term ecosystem disruption diaz and rosenberg 2008 glibert et al 2010 bailey et al 2020 global changes in nitrogen and phosphorus use are primarily driven by the need for food production increases in world food production in recent decades have been facilitated by increases in the amount of land under cultivation and irrigation aquastat 2014 fao 2017 iwmi 2017 but arguably as importantly by increases in the use of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers lambin et al 2003 sutton et al 2013 lu and hanqin 2017 increases in the amount of land under cultivation have come from the conversion of forest lands and wetlands to agricultural lands which can result in mobilization and loss of nutrients stored in soils and vegetation schneider et al 2017 terrestrial mobilization is defined as the internal production or addition of reactive soluble and or plant available forms of nitrogen and phosphorus to a watershed this term thus encompasses nutrients converted from non reactive to reactive forms by land disturbance as well as fertilizer and manure additions and sewage production in addition to the mobilization of nutrients stored in soils and vegetation the uptake efficiency of fertilizer use on agricultural lands is relatively low e g crops typically take up only 40 50 of the total organic and inorganic n added during each cropping season bleken and bakken 1997 sutton et al 2013 while the use of fertilizers supports plant growth it imbalances the nutrient budget raaijmakers et al 2009 gordon et al 2008 creating a high potential for export to surrounding ecosystems that include rivers lakes streams and coastal zones seitzinger et al 2010 leach et al 2012 fao 2017 conversion of native ecosystems forests and wetlands to agricultural or urban land perturbs ecosystem processes and can influence stocks and fluxes of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus the dominant global land use change has been the clearance of forest and other native ecosystems for agricultural use levy et al 2004 converting natural ecosystems to cultivated agriculture has been shown to result in losses of 20 50 of the soil c stock in the topmost meter of the soil and losses of nitrogen and phosphorus associated with this soil carbon are also considerable berihu et al 2016 fao 2007 similarly wetlands are declining globally as a result of land conversion in some regions of the world more than 50 of peatlands marshes riparian zones lake littoral zones and floodplains have been lost primarily due to conversion to agriculture mitsch and gosselink 2000 clarkson et al 2013 as with forests these conversions result in mobilization and loss of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus moreover wetlands provide critical ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling water quality improvement water storage flood abatement and habitat provision zedler and kercher 2005 kumari et al 2020 in particular wetlands remove significant quantities of nitrogen via denitrification hunt et al 2014 these ecosystem services are lost when wetlands are converted or changed to other ecosystems zedler 2003 russi et al 2013 an additional significant land change is the conversion of agricultural or native ecosystems to urban land grimm et al 2008b these conversions are caused by the relatively higher value associated with urban compared to agricultural land use irwin and bockstael 2007 urbanization can be rapid and is often irreversible schneider and woodcock 2008 with more than half of the world s population now living in urban areas united nations department of economic and social affairs population division 2019 cities are centers of production consumption and waste disposal and can be highly concentrated point sources of nitrogen and phosphorus delivered to receiving waters in contrast to the more diffuse nonpoint sources that originate on agricultural lands novotny and olem 1994 xu et al 2016 south and southeast asia ssea is a region with many fast developing nations including india cambodia sri lanka indonesia laos brunei pakistan singapore thailand philippines nepal myanmar bhutan vietnam and bangladesh fig 1 these countries encompass an area of 6 05 million square km and support a population of 2 36 billion they represent almost 31 of the world s population but only 6 57 of the world s land area populations throughout ssea are rapidly urbanizing both urban land area and urban populations increased by 20 30 between 2000 and 2010 schneider et al 2015 over half the world s expansion in urban land over the next two decades is predicted to occur in asia with much of this occurring in relatively rural south asian countries such as vietnam and myanmar schewenius et al 2014 ssea falls within the warm humid tropics and its geography and climate support a high biodiversity of plants and animals one of the main geographical characteristics of this region is that it contains some of the world s largest river delta systems including the mekong south east asia brahmaputra meghna india and bangladesh and krishna godavari india ericson et al 2006 population growth and urbanization have caused enormous pressure to convert land from natural and agricultural areas into residential and urban uses with significant impacts on ecosystem services justice et al 2015 viewed within a historical context asia has experienced dramatic land transformations and has the highest deforestation rate of any major tropical region mainly for cash crop such as palm oil and agriculture zhao et al 2006 wilcove et al 2013 although land use change occurs at the local level it impacts human societies across regional and global scales as well zhao et al 2006 this study examined land transformations in the ssea region along with fertilizer and sewage inputs and how these have mobilized terrestrial nutrients specifically nitrogen and phosphorus that can then be transported to coastal ecosystems given the rapid rise of population and urban development across the region it is important to understand links between conditions and trajectories of land cover change and subsequent impacts on coastal ecosystems two watersheds the mekong and krishna godavari were selected as focal points for this study these watersheds provide excellent contrast between different types and rates of land use change the study addressed the following research questions a what is the nature and extent of land conversion in the study area over the past 20 years b how have land changes altered nitrogen and phosphorus stored in soils over this time period c which land conversions have the biggest effects on nitrogen and phosphorus storage in soils and thus the potentially largest impact on the transfer of these nutrients to coastal waters d how does terrestrial nutrient mobilization associated with land conversion compare with fertilizer inputs and sewage production as possible sources of nitrogen and phosphorus to coastal waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview data on the area of land converted from one land cover to another between 2002 and 2016 was produced by collaborators on a nasa funded research project entitled coastal hypoxia analysis and risk tracking chart through remote sensing and process based modeling the change in area for forest conversion to agriculture land wetland conversion to agriculture land forest conversion to urban area and agriculture land conversion to urban area were estimated using time series analysis of modis data tang et al 2019 tang et al 2020 tang et al 2021 then data were mined from the literature on soil carbon nitrogen and phosphorus pools associated with different land covers across the region including for agriculture forest urban and wetland we had a particular focus on studies that included detailed and controlled analysis on the effects of conversion from one land cover to another on these pools these data on soil pools of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus and the changes in those pools with land conversion were then combined with the areal estimates of land cover change to calculate the total terrestrial carbon nitrogen and phosphorus mobilization associated with land conversion in these study regions data on fertilizer input of nitrogen and phosphorus for the study watersheds were taken from compilations produced by the united nations food and agricultural organization food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2020 these compilations include data on nitrogen fertilizer in the form of nh3 and phosphorus fertilizer in the form of p2o5 they also compile data on nitrogen in manure applied to agricultural land and the amount of this manure nitrogen that leaches from soil these data were combined with estimates of the area of agricultural land in these watersheds to estimate the total nitrogen and phosphorus mobilization by fertilizer inputs from 2002 to 2016 estimates of nitrogen and phosphorus mobilization associated with sewage and detergent use were made by combining estimates of sewage human emission rates for nitrogen and phosphorus with estimates of the total population for both study regions van drecht et al 2009 2 2 case study watersheds the analysis focused on two watersheds in ssea the mekong and the krishna godavari the mekong river basin covers a total area of 795 000 km2 with a long term average annual surface flow of 470 km3 making it the twenty first largest river basin worldwide distributed between china 21 percent myanmar 3 percent lao people s democratic republic 25 percent thailand 23 percent cambodia 20 percent and vietnam 8 percent fig 3 the river basin can be divided into two parts the upper basin in china and the lower mekong basin the upper and lower basins make up 24 and 76 percent respectively of the total area of the basin which and cover 190 800 and 604 200 km2 respectively ingalls et al 2018 the mekong river is the second most biodiverse river in the world after the amazon and supports the world s largest freshwater capture fishery mrc 2005 mrc 2010a the river basin supports a population of 60 million many of whom are totally dependent on it for their subsistence through the provision of inland fisheries agriculture tourism and hydropower campbell 2009 mrc 2019 the godavari river is the second largest river in india with a catchment area of 312 812 km2 and a long term average annual surface flow of 110 km3 fig 4 it originates near trimbak in nashik district of maharashtra state and flows east across the deccan plateau into the bay of bengal near narasapuram in west godavari district of andhra pradesh the number of dams constructed in the godavari basin is the highest among all river basins in india padmavathi et al 2019 the krishna river basin is the fourth largest in india with a total catchment area of 258 948 km2 and a long term average annual surface flow of 78 km3 amarasinghe et al 2005 the krishna godavari delta on the east coast of india comprises two separate areas built by processes in the two corresponding river systems although the deltas of these two rivers have coalesced to appear as a single physiographic unit the delta has significant economic e g aquaculture and ecological e g mangroves resources rao 1985 2 3 data collection the research questions about how land transformations in ssea have mobilized terrestrial nutrients were addressed by gathering and analyzing literature data fig 2 the data sets used included published articles and international and national reports on fertilizer use sewage inputs land use and land cover change and its effects on soil carbon nitrogen and phosphorus dynamics in the ssea region for the literature search a wide range of online databases and publishing groups such as google scholar researchgate jstor science direct elsevier etc were used some papers that were not available directly from online databases were obtained from the authors upon request appendix a 2 4 statistical analysis estimates from the literature required harmonization to facilitate their synthesis different studies reported changes in soil carbon nitrogen and phosphorus in different units to different depth or mass of soil and dealt with soil weight and density in different ways all data were ultimately converted into the common unit of kg n or p per ha variation among studies in the time since ecosystems had been converted represents a significant source of variation and uncertainty in the analysis data on soil bulk density weight volume are essential for calculating quantities of soil nitrogen carbon and phosphorus for studies that did not report bulk density estimates were calculated based on soil texture information provided in the recent literature zeri et al 2018 the depth to which soil samples were taken varied from 10 to 800 cm to facilitate comparison across studies the shallowest sampling depths were used e g 0 15 cm if the sampling depths were provided when the results were given in percentage change for carbon nitrogen and phosphorus data on bulk density and depth were used to calculate soil mass and were combined with concentration data to produce estimates of soil carbon nitrogen and phosphorus in kg per ha pribyl 2010 data from the literature were compiled and used to compare estimate changes in soil nitrogen phosphorus and carbon pools for the following land conversions forest to agriculture forest to urban agriculture to urban wetland to agriculture these estimates were then combined with areal estimates of these land conversions derived from remote sensing by tang et al 2021 to establish the quantities of soil nitrogen phosphorus and carbon mobilized by the conversions three different approaches were used to calculate the quantities of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus mobilized by land conversions 1 comparison of mean values for different land use types based on all studies 2 comparison of mean values from all studies with outlier values three standard deviations above the mean removed and 3 comparison of mean values only from studies that had controlled comparisons of different land uses data on fertilizer inputs and sewage production in the watersheds were also assembled and compared with the land conversion effects fig 2 3 results 3 1 land conversion effects on carbon nitrogen and phosphorus a total of 76 papers were collected from the literature search for land conversion effects on carbon nitrogen and phosphorus appendix a we calculated the mean standard deviation standard error and data counts for soil carbon nitrogen and phosphorus pools in each land use type table 1 and produced frequency distribution histograms showing outliers values more than three standard deviations away from the mean fig 5 comparison of the mean values for all forest agriculture urban and wetland soil values shows a decrease in carbon nitrogen and phosphorus for all conversions except conversion of forest to agricultural lands which showed increases in carbon and nitrogen fig 6 comparison of the mean values for all forest agriculture urban and wetland soil following removal of values more than three standard deviation from mean shows similar patterns with some variable effect on nitrogen fig 7 a more restricted comparison that includes only studies that made direct comparisons between different land use types showed a narrower range of effects here all conversions resulted in the loss of soil carbon with variable effects on nitrogen and phosphorus fig 8 this approach also allows for calculation of the variance of change as the estimate is the product of 72 direct comparisons rather than subtraction of two mean values 3 2 land conversions in studied watersheds estimates of the extent of land conversions for the time period from 2002 to 2016 were derived from remote sensing provided by tang et al 2021 all of our estimates of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus change including those associated with fertilizer and sewage are benchmarked to this period the land change analysis includes three types of forest evergreen forest deciduous and mixed wetlands are categorized as either mangrove or flooded forest agriculture land is categorized as rice paddy plantation cropland and aquaculture land conversion was more active in the mekong compared to the krishna godavari watershed in the mekong watershed over 16 000 km2 of land was converted from 2002 to 2016 which accounts for 2 from the total watershed area table 2 this change was dominated by conversion of 13 025 km2 of forest into agricultural land followed by 1981 km2 converted from wetland to agriculture 885 km2 converted from agricultural to urban land and 185 km2 converted from forest into urban land more changes were detected in the lower basin of the region than the upper basin fig 9 in the krishna godavari watershed over 2380 km2 of land was converted between 2002 and 2016 which accounts for 0 7 of the total watershed area table 3 this change was dominated by conversion of agriculture to urban land 2249 km2 followed by conversion of forest to urban land 88 km2 and conversion of forest to agriculture 44 km2 no conversion of wetland to agriculture was detected in this region fig 10 3 3 estimates of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus mobilized by land conversion the values derived from the mean change in soil carbon nitrogen and phosphorus pools based on studies that made direct comparisons between different land use types were combined with estimates of the area of different conversions for the mekong table 2 and krishna godavari table 3 watersheds in the mekong watershed the expansion of agriculture at the expense of forest was the dominant land conversion however conversion of wetlands to agriculture mobilized the most terrestrial carbon i e 5 93 1010 kg followed by conversion of forest to agriculture which mobilized 2 89 1010 kg of terrestrial carbon conversion of forests to agriculture mobilized 3 26 109 kg of terrestrial nitrogen in the mekong followed by conversion of wetlands to agriculture which mobilized 2 64 109 kg of terrestrial nitrogen conversion of forests to agriculture and urban land mobilized phosphorus while conversion of wetlands to agriculture increased phosphorus stored in the soil in the mekong watershed table 2 urbanization was the largest land conversion in the krishna godavari watershed with urban land increasing at the expense of agriculture and forest only small areas of forest were converted to agriculture and there was no evidence of conversion of wetlands to agriculture conversion of agriculture to urban land mobilized 9 76 108 kg of terrestrial carbon whereas conversion of agriculture to urban increased soil nitrogen stocks in the krishna godavari watershed forest conversion to agriculture land mobilized 4 94 105 kg of terrestrial phosphorus in this watershed followed by the conversion of agriculture to urban land which mobilized 3 37 105 kg of terrestrial phosphorus no terrestrial mobilization of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus was detected for wetland to agriculture conversions table 3 3 4 fertilizer and sewage inputs total fertilizer inputs 2002 2016 averaged 1 21 109 kg yr of nitrogen and 5 85 108 kg yr of phosphorus in the mekong watershed table 4 and 3 56 109 kg yr of nitrogen and 1 45 109 kg yr of phosphorus in the krishna godavari watershed table 5 these inputs increased from 2002 to 2016 in both watersheds with more variability from year to year in the mekong watershed and a greater rate of increase in the krishna godavari fig 11 and fig 12 we estimated the total n and p emission from sewage by multiplying average p and n kg person year derived from van drecht et al 2009 by population estimates for the years 2002 2008 and 2016 government of india 2001 2011 mrc 2019 we also calculated point source and non point sources of sewage input for nitrogen and phosphorus based on information obtained from unicef and world health organization 2015 mrc 2019 total sewage nitrogen emissions 2002 2016 averaged 2 43 108 kg yr for the mekong and 5 93 108 kg yr in the krishna godavari total sewage phosphorus emissions including phosphorus inputs associated with detergent emissions were estimated as 4 09 107 kg yr in the mekong and 1 0 108 kg yr in the krishna godavari from 2002 to 2016 the population of the lower mekong region increased from 53 million to 65 million people similarly the population of the krishna godavari watershed increased from 130 million to 160 million over this same time period these population increases and increasing human nitrogen and phosphorus emissions rates have increased sewage and detergent inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus in both watersheds table 6 table 7 to estimate point and non point sources it was necessary to split the total nitrogen and phosphorus emissions from sewage into urban sewered urban unsewered rural sewered and rural unsewered populations in the mekong basin about 80 of the population lives in rural and 20 live in urban areas mrc 2019 while in the krishna godavari region half of the population lives in rural areas government of india 2011 the urban sanitation of the countries in the mekong basin has improved from 1990 to 2015 such that more than 90 percent of the urban population uses improved sanitation facilities and 65 percent of the rural population uses improved sanitation facilities similarly in india around 63 percent of the urban population uses improved sanitation facilities while only 28 percent of the rural population uses improved sanitation facilities improved sanitation facilities include flushed and septic systems and piped sewage lines in contrast to open defecation and shared or mixed unimproved sanitation facilities unicef and world health organization 2015 we assumed that improved sanitation facilities produce point sources and that other sanitation are non point sources of sewage we estimated point sources urban and rural combined of sewage as 1 72 108 kg yr and 2 7 108 kg yr of nitrogen for the mekong and krishna godavari watershed region respectively we estimate non point urban and rural combined sources of sewage as 7 107 kg yr and 3 2 108 kg yr of nitrogen for mekong and krishna godavari watershed region respectively tables 8 and 9 fertilizer was the largest source of terrestrial nitrogen and phosphorus mobilization in both watersheds in the mekong watershed nitrogen fertilizer accounted for 66 of input followed by land conversion 21 and sewage 13 fig 13 table 10 fertilizer accounted for 93 of terrestrial phosphorus mobilization and sewage represented 7 in the mekong land conversions did not contribute to mobilization of phosphorus in this watershed fertilizer was even more dominant in the krishna godavari fig 14 table 10 accounting for 85 and 94 of terrestrial nitrogen and phosphorus mobilization respectively sewage accounted for 14 of nitrogen and 6 of phosphorus in the krishna godavari land conversion was not a significant source for either nitrogen or phosphorus mobilization in the krishna godavari watershed 4 discussion 4 1 the importance of land conversion for terrestrial carbon nitrogen and phosphorus mobilization land use change such as the conversion of forest to agricultural use alters soil physical chemical and biological properties these changes are driven by alteration of the quality and quantity of nutrient inputs to and losses from the soil and by stimulation of decomposition through soil disturbance murty et al 2002 forest trees remove significant amounts of carbon from the atmosphere keenan and williams 2018 carbon in plant materials enters the soil through above ground litterfall root and mycorrhizal turnover and carbon exudation from roots carfdon 1996 feller and beare 1997 heterophic respiration by decomposers of litter and soil organic matter returns some soil carbon to atmosphere while other fractions of the carbon are transformed into stable organic complexes or humus aber and melillo 1991 this terrestrial carbon and the nitrogen and phosphorus associated with this carbon can be mobilized and lost from the ecosystem when humans convert the forest into other ecosystems such as agriculture our analysis here shows that land conversion has mobilized important quantities of terrestrial carbon nitrogen and phosphorus in the highly dynamic ssea region however our analysis suggests that these quantities are small relative to nutrient inputs associated with fertilizer use especially for nitrogen and particularly in the krishna godavari watershed our results are consistent with studies conducted around the world on land conversions and its effect on soil carbon and nitrogen in northeastern costa rica powers and s 2004 found that conversion of forests to bananas decreased soil c concentrations in the surface soil by 37 percent in ethiopia berihu et al 2016 found that conversion of natural ecosystems to cultivated agriculture resulted in losses of between 20 and 50 percent of the soil c stocks in the first meter of the soil in the southern united states zhang et al 2012 showed that while urbanization initially caused a decline in soil carbon storage established urban areas may gradually accumulate carbon over time in iran mahrer et al 2014 found that conversion of forest to tea garden decreased the soil carbon to nitrogen and carbon to phosphorus ratios but increased soil organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorus content in mexico anaya et al 2015 found that conversion of tropical forest to traditional sugarcane agriculture reduced soil carbon and nitrogen by 25 percent at 0 10 cm depth after 20 years of cultivation compared after 50 years of cultivation carbon stocks were similar in sugarcane and forest plots while soil n stocks remained 12 19 lower in sugarcane than in forest plots over 0 20 cm 4 2 the quantities of terrestrial carbon nitrogen and phosphorus mobilized by land conversions three approaches were used to calculate the effect of land conversions on the mobilization of terrestrial carbon nitrogen and phosphorous in the first approach we compared means for different land use types based on all studies that we were able to compile from the literature fig 6 this approach showed an unexpected steep increase about 316 in soil carbon when forests were converted to agriculture this increase was mainly driven by high estimates for wetland conversion to agricultural land for other land conversions in this analysis of all studies carbon decreases ranged from 73 to 93 similarly soil nitrogen pools increased by 17 in the forest to agriculture conversion but decreased from 23 to 87 in other ecosystem conversions there was no change in mean phosphorus in the forest to agriculture conversion for all other conversions phosphorus decreased from 73 to 90 the increase in soil carbon with the conversion of forest to agriculture that we observed with our first approach was unexpected because many studies around the world have shown decreases in soil carbon when forests are converted to agriculture piao et al 2012 schlesinger and bernhardt 2013 for example houghton 2002 and hergoualc h and verchot 2011 observed significant decreases in carbon storage with forest to agricultural conversions in tropical asia including ssea kaul et al 2009 found a similar decrease in soil carbon with forest to agriculture conversions in india murty et al 2002 found losses of 24 for carbon and 15 for nitrogen in a study of tropical forest converted to agricultural land similarly a study conducted by sharma et al 2019 using multitemporal satellite data in semiarid region of rajasthan india from 2003 to 2014 found conversion of forest to agricultural land led to loss of carbon the increases in soil nitrogen and phosphorus when forests and wetlands were converted to agricultural land that we observed were not unexpected because of fertilizer inputs to agricultural land the decrease in soil nitrogen when forests and agriculture were converted to urban land likely depends on just what the urban land is being used for and the nutrient inputs that are associated with that use e g urban gardens versus residential or commercial areas the second approach to calculating terrestrial mobilization associated with land conversion compared mean values from all studies with outlier values removed fig 7 extreme values were particularly important for wetland conversions this approach still showed an unexpected increase in carbon associated with forest to agriculture conversions 150 but showed decreases in carbon from 68 to 95 for all other conversions nitrogen decreased for the wetland to agriculture and agriculture to urban conversions by 91 and 10 respectively but increased from 27 to 42 in all other conversions phosphorus decreased in all conversions from 2 to 84 the third approach to calculation of mobilization of terrestrial carbon nitrogen and phosphorus associated with land conversion was a comparison limited to studies that had controlled comparisons of different land uses fig 8 this approach showed decreases in carbon in all conversions from 11 to 38 a smaller range than observed with the two other approaches nitrogen increased by 15 in agriculture to urban conversions but decreased in all other ecosystem conversions there was a significant increase in phosphorus 89 for the wetland to agriculture conversion for other conversions phosphorus decreased from 2 to 24 the declines in both nitrogen and phosphorus in the forest to agriculture conversion suggest that the loss of nutrients associated with soil carbon was a more important driver than fertilizer input in these conversions these results are consistent with prasad et al 1995 who also found a reduction of total nitrogen 26 35 and total phosphorus by 33 44 with the conversion of forest to cropland in eastern india 4 3 estimates of terrestrial nutrients mobilized by land conversions at the watershed scale we used results from the third approach i e comparison of mean values from studies that had controlled comparisons of different land uses to produce estimates of terrestrial carbon nitrogen and phosphorus mobilized by land conversion in the mekong and krishna godavari watersheds we used the results from this approach because they were less affected by extreme values and were less variable than results from the other approaches moreover results from this approach were consistent with other studies and with general principles of how land conversion should affect soil nutrient stocks in the mekong watershed conversion of forest to agriculture land was the dominant conversion accounting for 81 of the total converted land area conversion of agriculture to urban land accounted for 6 of converted land 12 of the converted area was from wetland to agriculture land and only 1 of the converted area was from forest to urban land multiplying the average values for carbon nitrogen and phosphorus change with conversion by the estimates of the converted area suggests that on average 5 92 109 kg yr of terrestrial carbon and 3 87 108 kg yr of terrestrial nitrogen was mobilized in the mekong watershed from 2002 to 2016 on average 5 59 107 kg yr of terrestrial phosphorus accumulated in the soil over this same time period mostly as a result of conversions to agricultural land in the krishna godavari watershed the conversion of agricultural land to urban land accounted for 94 of the converted area conversion of forests to urban land accounted for 4 of land change and conversion from forest to agriculture accounted for 2 of change no conversions from wetlands to agriculture were reported in this watershed these conversions mobilized an average of 7 80 107 kg yr of terrestrial carbon and 7 47 104 kg yr of terrestrial phosphorus from 2002 to 2016 whereas 2 02 107 yr kg of terrestrial nitrogen accumulated in soils in urban areas over this same period 4 4 the importance of fertilizer inputs fertilizer was the largest source of nitrogen and phosphorus added to both the mekong and krishna godavari watersheds fertilizer accounted for an average of 1 2 109 kg yr of nitrogen and 5 85 108 kg yr of phosphorus in the mekong watershed and 3 56 109 kg yr of nitrogen and 1 45 109 kg yr of phosphorus in the krishna godavari from 2002 to 2016 these results are consistent with the study done by pedde et al 2017 who found that fertilizers and manure were the two largest sources 32 and 26 respectively of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din eventually delivered by rivers draining into the bay of bengal large marine ecosystem the importance of fertilizer as a source of mobile nutrients in these watersheds figs 11 and 12 is likely to continue to increase in the next few years and decades the world demand for total fertilizer nutrients grew at 2 0 percent per annum from 2011 to 2015 and asia is now the largest consumer of fertilizer in the world total fertilizer nutrient consumption in asia is 60 percent of the world s total and south asia is the second largest fertilizer consuming region in the world fao 2011 declining yield response to fertilizer a major concern in south asian agriculture systems mujeri et al 2013 and could be driver of increases in fertilizer intensity at the same time there is interest in increasing fertilizer use efficiency nue which is defined as the biomass productivity per unit fertilizer applied ortiz monasterio et al 2001 there are several strategies for improving fertilizer use efficiency such as integrated nutrient management improved fertilizer application methods green manuring use of slow release fertilizers and or nitrification inhibitors crop rotation conservation agriculture crop residue management and precision farming raghavendra et al 2020 agricultural land in both watershed regions is managed primarily by small and marginal agricultural households ingalls et al 2018 who generally have a higher intensity of nitrogen fertilizer use pani et al 2021 farmers in the south and southeast asian regions are usually not aware of the nutrient needs of their crops or the current status of their soils for appropriate fertilization there is a strong need to increase awareness and knowledge among farmers about soil health and to provide advice training on applying fertilizer in the right amount at the right time and rate this can be accomplished by strengthening and enhancing extension services related to fertilizer integrated nutrient management and other agricultural inputs to farmers there is also a strong need to clarify fertilizer subsidy policies and to harmonize these policies with a framework that emphasizes efficiency mujeri et al 2013 4 5 the importance of sewage production and other possible sources of nitrogen and phosphorus the krishna godavari basin supports a population of more than 160 million persons government of india 2011 and 90 of the total water available from the krishna river is used for irrigation gaur et al 2007 the lower mekong river basin lmb is a diverse region with approximately 65 million people mrc 2019 on an average per day each person in these basins produces 70 100 l of sewage or wastewater and treatment of this waste is minimal mitra 2014 it is estimated that 90 of the wastewater in developing countries is discharged untreated into waterways and coastal areas boblme 2015 wwap 2017 sewage is particularly important for nitrogen and phosphorus mobilization because about 80 of total human n excretion and 62 of total human p excretion are in urine similarly 20 of human nitrogen and 38 of human phosphorus are in feces roy 2017 simha et al 2017 puijenbroek et al 2019 mihelcicet al 2011 thus sewage represents a particularly mobile source of nutrients that are

sanitation is increasing except in india where the number of people without improved sanitation facilities is increasing unicef and world health organization 2015 sewage discharge to surface waters in the region is expected to increase substantially between 2020 and 2050 from the combined impact of increasing population urbanization and provision of sewers puijenbroek et al 2019 the development of sewage systems will increase both the amount and nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in sewage water van drecht et al 2009 sewage nutrient content is also affected by diet increases in purchasing power which are expected in the ssea region lead to increases in food protein consumption and associated human n emission union bank of switzerland 2006 there is a clear need for continued monitoring and analysis of how changes in treatment and diet will affect nutrient loads from sewage in these watersheds mccarty 2018 huyen and lai 2019 puijenbroek et al 2019 recent case studies in south east

and comparing different sources ssea is a rapidly developing region with dynamic changes occurring in the various sectoral drivers pressures and sources that drive nutrient enrichment and consequent potential eutrophication the key sectors include agriculture aquaculture wastewater management and fertilizer production model studies indicate that globally roughly equal amounts of reactive n reach the oceans from fertilizer manure and atmospheric deposition with smaller fractions from sewage seitzinger et al 2010 these results are consistent with our results which showed that fertilizer was the most important source of reactive n and p notably previous studies have not evaluated the importance of land conversion as a source of terrestrial nitrogen and phosphorus mobilization in coastal watersheds for the mekong watershed the sources of nitrogen are more varied than in the krishna godavari watershed because land conversion is more active in this watershed according to liljeström et al 2012 the majority of the lower mekong basin nitrogen flux originates from agricultural areas 53 followed by forest and woods and shrubland areas 39 for phosphorus flux the figures are 75 and 21 respectively these results are consistent with this study which found that 66 of terrestrial nitrogen mobilized in the mekong region was from fertilizer input with the rest associated with land conversion 21 and sewage inputs 13 for the krishna godavari watershed terrestrial nitrogen mobilized by fertilizer input was much higher 85 followed by sewage 14 and land conversions 1 fertilizer inputs contribute more than 93 of the terrestrial phosphorus mobilization in both the mekong and krishna godavari watersheds sewage was a small contributor for both watersheds about 7 of phosphorus for the mekong region and approximately 6 of phosphorus for the krishna godavari watersheds land conversion does not appear to be a significant source of terrestrial phosphorus mobilization in either watershed although land conversion was not a dominant source of terrestrial mobilization of nitrogen and phosphorus when compared to fertilizer in the long term conversion of forests and wetlands to agriculture and urban will increase fertilizer use and sewage production we estimate that on average 4 13 109 kg yr of nitrogen and 1 55 109 kg yr of phosphorus were mobilized in the krishna godavari watershed and that an average of 1 83 109 kg yr of terrestrial nitrogen and 5 90 108 kg yr of terrestrial phosphorus were mobilized in the mekong watershed from 2002 to 2016 it is important to note that nitrogen has numerous forms and transformations that vary over time and space wollheim et al 2008 here we focused on total nitrogen tn without considering different forms of this nitrogen e g inorganic versus organic dissolved versus particulate it is also important to note that our estimates of terrestrial mobilization of nitrogen are not equivalent to inflow into the coastal region due to multiple potential sinks between the land and sea including denitrification the microbial conversion of reactive nitrogen into nitrogen gases plant and microbial uptake and sedimentation these processes vary with temperature precipitation water residence times soil characteristics and river network geomorphology wollheim et al 2006 wollheim et al 2008 boyer et al 2002 the mekong river is experiencing rapid development with plans in place for the construction of 77 hydropower projects in the basin by 2030 baran et al 2015 similarly there are numerous dams and reservoirs in the krishna godavari river mainly used for irrigation power diversion or storage purpose kakani et al 2010 the current dams and future projects will have a substantial impact on the quality and quantity of terrestrial nitrogen and phosphorus that reaches coastal regions maavara et al 2020 lanza 2011 several other studies have observed significant quantities of nitrogen and phosphorus in the mekong and krishna godavari watersheds bhalla and waykar 2012 found that the concentrations of nitrate and phosphate were highest in the godavari river in winter followed by summer and were lowest in the monsoon season with an average of 1 35 mg l of nitrate and 0 93 mg l of phosphate modi et al 2017 found an average nitrate concentration of 8 44 mg l in a range of water samples from the krishna and godavari rivers krishna et al 2016 estimated that 8 06 107 kg of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din and 3 12 107 kg of phosphate are exported to the bay of bengal by the krishna godavari river annually the bay of bengal receives around 9 109 n kg year 1 through major indian rivers singh and ramesh 2011 many other studies have quantified din levels in indian rivers and while these waters are mostly safe for consumption except in areas where urban and industrial wastes are released verma et al 2012 chauhan and sagar 2013 mallika et al 2015 jamwal et al 2015 the levels are still high enough to be of concern for eutrophication moreover reports suggest that nitrate pollution of ground waters is increasing in several areas in india rao et al 2017 but the importance of groundwater discharge of nutrients into coastal regions is unclear moore 1997 subramanian 2008 somayajulu 2008 in the lower mekong river nitrate nitrate concentrations were 0 23 mg l in 2000 and 0 29 mg l in 2016 and 0 32 mg l in 2017 was recorded mrc 2019 between 2000 and 2017 total phosphorus concentrations in the lower mekong river increased slightly from 0 058 mg l in 2000 to 0 09 mg l in 2017 mrc 2019 in spite of the multiple pressures from point and non point sources of pollution studies show that the mekong mainstream was less polluted than its tributaries chea et al 2016 mrc 2005 mrc 2019 the growing and urbanizing population accelerating land use changes and increasing economic activity will likely interact to increase nutrient effects on coastal ecosystems in both the mekong and krishna godavari regions agricultural land across the lower mekong region increased by more than 9 million hectares or around 21 percent between 1996 and 2015 the increase in agricultural land increases the demand for and use of fertilizer ingalls et al 2018 for the countries of the ssea region agriculture remains the major source of livelihood with fertilizer input being the most important contributor to nutrient pollution fao 2019 fao 2011b terrestrial fluxes of nutrients from rivers to the coastal zone can contribute to the development of eutrophic and hypoxic conditions in ssea coastal waters satpathy et al 2013 with potentially significant socioeconomic impacts as many of the basin s inhabitants depend heavily on coastal resources for food and economic security liljeström et al 2012 the regions will also face many challenges in terms of sustainable development of agriculture because of increasing involvement in international trade and declines in the availability of agricultural labor and arable land szudy 2015 in addition land degradation and reduction in water availability as a result of climate change and natural disasters will affect the agricultural system in future atapattu and kodituwakku 2009 these changes will have complex effects on the relationships between land use and water quality across ssea 5 limitations of the study while our analysis has produced clear information on sources of terrestrial nutrient mobilization in the study watersheds there are several critical uncertainties data availability in the region is limited especially for land cover change and its effect on nutrients in wetlands and urban areas across the region detailed estimates of total nutrient loads from different sectors such as agriculture sewage or industry are not available or if available quite limited a major source of information is through international research projects and donor organization reports fao who mrc etc there is a clear need for further research on the areal extent and the nutrient dynamics of these ssea ecosystems yet there is limited research on these topics in the region data availability varies markedly across the region india has relatively more data and information compared to other ssea countries so the analysis of land conversion effects largely emphasizes results from india industrial operations which were not addressed in this study also release effluents that add to the nutrient budget of the coastal areas and are another possible source that is likely to increase in the future iarc 2010 even within the detailed studies variability in sampling depth and measurements of bulk density may produce errors in results dependence on the internet for reports and technical papers and the vast literature that had to be combined to filter relevant data were also major constraints of this study 6 conclusions evaluating the effects of land conversion on terrestrial nutrient mobilization is challenging restricted comparisons that include only studies that make direct controlled comparisons between different land uses are most useful but are rare still our analysis showed that all conversions resulted in the loss of soil carbon with variable effects on nitrogen and phosphorus the expansion of agriculture at the expense of forest was the dominant land conversion in the mekong watershed whereas urbanization was the largest land conversion in the krishna godavari watershed with urban land increasing at the expense of agriculture and forest land conversion is a significant source of terrestrial nitrogen mobilization in the mekong watershed where land use change is active fertilizer was the largest source of nitrogen and phosphorus added to both watersheds sewage was an important source of nitrogen in both watersheds and its direct addition to water bodies may increase the negative impact of this source on receiving waters these results suggest that management of coastal hypoxia in ssea will need to focus on reducing the use and or improving the efficiency of fertilizer use along with consolidated monitoring efforts from all countries regions linked with the watershed regions management of sewage will be an important but complex challenge improvements in the collection and treatment of human waste are likely in the region but the effects of these improvements on nutrient delivery to coastal waters will depend on whether nutrient removal tertiary treatment is a component of that treatment mccarty 2018 ongoing land conversions and nutrients inputs throughout these regions are a current challenge and will remain so for future generations addressing these challenges will require improved documentation and study which to date has been limited declaration of competing interest

20053,water insecurity is a major concern both in the global and local contexts the study estimated the sub catchment water poverty index and the household water security index on cross sectional farm household data collected from 652 households randomly selected from eight sub catchments of the upper ewaso ng iro north catchment area ennca the impact of water security on household income per adult equivalent and prevalence of waterborne diseases was assessed using ordinary least squares regression and poisson regression models respectively water poverty index wpi results revealed that sirimon and ewaso narok sub catchments are faced with acute water stress while the rest of the sub catchments are faced with moderate water stress despite being in the sub catchment area the results showed that improved water security can offer welfare benefits to households through increments in household income and reduced water borne disease prevalence from the findings therefore improved water security can offer both economic and health solutions to some of the country s problems including poverty alleviation and reduce the government s budget spending on communicable and non communicable water related diseases keywords water security water poverty index waterborne diseases 1 introduction small holder irrigation has been proven to be a pathway out of poverty and inequality with the

challenge not only in the asal areas but also in more water rich regions where water intensive economic activities have grown rapidly the upper ennca included davies and gustaffson 2015 mungai et al

due to effective management of multiple water uses and wastewater rosegrant 2020 bain et al 2014 collins et al 2007 finally according to cooper 2020 strengthening water security is essential for preventing and combating future pandemics including the current covid 19 pandemic since handwashing is one of the key measures to suppress the spread of covid 19 while water security is a concern the main challenge in research circles is the measurement of household water insecurity and establishing its effects on household welfare since researchers and practitioners have few tools to quantitatively measure assess and compare the scope and scale of household and individual water insecurity across cultural and climatic variations jepson et al 2017 further jepson et al 2017 notes that water insecurity metrics can be categorized into four conceptual domains human development sustainability geopolitics and vulnerability while our scale of interest is the sub catchment level and the unit of study is the household we therefore use the water poverty index wpi to measure water security for three reasons first is that it follows the human development concept in its approach jepson et al 2017 sullivan 2002 and secondly it uses a holistic approach since it considers available water resources the access to the water resources the capacity to manage the water resources the current uses of the available water resources in including shortfalls and any environmental factors that may affect water resource availability finally it can be used to measure household water security through the use of principal component analysis pca and factor analysis garriga and foguet 2010 previous studies have used the wpi in economic analysis senna et al 2019 sinyolo et al 2014 matshe et al 2013 garriga and foguet 2010 sullivan 2002 the novelty of this study is that it will generate new discourse about water security or insecurity thereof in water catchment areas which are mostly perceived to be water secure on the basic classification as water catchment areas this study therefore sought to add more knowledge to the existing knowledge on the measurement of household water security and extend the same to assess the impacts of water security on household welfare through a quantitative analysis approach in consideration that welfare is quite broad and multidimensional we use household income per adult equivalent and prevalence of water borne diseases as proxies for welfare the study has the following objectives to determine sub catchment water security in the upper ennca to assess the impact of household water security on household income per adult equivalent and to assess the impact of household water security on the prevalence of water borne diseases in the upper ennca the study has the following hypothesis there is a relationship between household level water security and household income per adult equivalent in the upper ennca there is a relationship between household level water security and the prevalence of water borne diseases in the upper ennca 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area the study was undertaken in the upper ewaso ng iro north catchment area ennca which is the catchment area for the ewaso ng iro river basin the ewaso ng iro river basin is the largest in kenya ennda 2019 it covers an area of about 210 226 km2 which is about 36 of the total area of kenya s 576 000 km2 it is the largest of all the six basin areas but with the least population this is because it falls in arid and semi arid asal parts of kenya altitude ranges from 150 m at the lorian swamp to 5 199 m at the peak of mount kenya the map of the ewaso ng iro north basin is shown in fig 1 the map shows the upper middle and lower basin areas from the map the importance of the upper catchment area cannot be overemphasized since it serves a large portion of the country which is mostly arid and semi arid areas asal according to mungai et al 2004 the upper ewaso ng iro north basin is located to the north and west of mount kenya extending to the aberdare ranges between longitudes 36030 e and 37045 e and latitudes 0015 n and 1000 n the map of the upper ewaso ng iro north catchment area is shown in fig 2 the catchment area is divided into 21 sub catchment areas as shown the upper catchment area is highly utilized for agricultural production due to favourable weather conditions fertile soils and irrigation water availability through river abstractions the main economic activity in upper ewaso ng iro north catchment is small scale farming rain fed and irrigation small scale fishery and pastoralism the area ranges from high potential high altitude to low potential arid and semi arid zones due to the arid nature of most parts of the basin the atmospheric demand for water is very high ericksen et al 2012 mutiga et al 2010 2 2 sampling strategy and sample frame data was collected in the period between september 2019 and february 2020 from a sample of 652 households a multistage sampling technique was employed in the study in the first stage eight sub catchments were sampled randomly out of the twenty one sub catchments of the upper ennca as a result the following sub catchments were sampled ewaso narok pesi rongai naromoru likii timau sirimon and ngare ndare in the second stage stratified sampling was done disproportionately to the population size of the sampled sub catchments since the number of households in each sub catchment was unknown finally simple random sampling was undertaken using a list from the wruas 2 3 types of data and data sources this study utilized both primary and secondary data sources primary data was collected from households wruas and key informants secondary data was collected from sources such as books journals and reports data collected for the study included household data group data farm produce data and income data a semi structured questionnaire was administered to the small scale farmers by trained enumerators using the world bank s computer aided personal interview capi program through face to face interviews data for the study were analyzed using stata version 15 0 statistical software 3 analytical framework 3 1 determination of sub catchment water security to determine sub catchment water security in the upper ennca kenya the water poverty index wpi was calculated for each of the sampled sub catchments following korc and ford 2013 the water poverty index wpi is a composite index principally designed to assist decision makers at different levels in developing and targeting interventions that aim to increase water security for the poor matshe et al 2013 sullivan et al 2003 the wpi stems from a realization that assessing households access to water requires a holistic approach that takes into consideration not only whether or not a household has access to water but also issues relating to water quality and variability multiple uses of water households capacity to manage water as well as environmental and spatial scale aspects related to water according to korc and ford 2013 wpi as a water management tool has found great relevance in policy formulation primarily in resource allocation and prioritization processes particularly in water poor countries like kenya in proposing a wpi that considers these aspects sullivan et al 2003 identify via a community participatory approach the following five components as key to a holistic wpi resources r this component captures the physical availability of both surface and groundwater access a this component considers access to water for human use drinking and nondrinking capacity c this component relates to the ability of people to manage water use u this component considers the multiple uses of water and environment e this component seeks to factor in environmental integrity related to water resources these five components are used to construct a wpi sullivan et al 2003 argue that the construction of the wpi should follow a structure similar to that of the human development index hdi specifically each component is constructed via the following general formula 1 wpi ϖ i i 1 n w i c i i 1 n w i where for each household wpi and ϖi refers to the water poverty index c i refers to component i of the household s wpi with i resources r access a capacity c use u and environment e while wi is the weight applied to that particular component the scores of each component are calculated using the average of all the sub components in each for instance the resources component has seven subcomponents for each sub catchment that is r1 to r7 as shown in table 1 one of the key challenges in the calculation of the wpi is the assignment of the respective weights to the components according to sullivan 2002 sullivan et al 2003 and sullivan and meigh 2007 assignment of equal weights is preferred to avoid problems of subjectivity since weights are applied to indicate the relative importance of a particular component in the wpi for the current study we used equal weights for two reasons the first is because of the recommendations by sullivan and meigh 2007 secondly during the piloting phase we conducted three focus group discussions with different stakeholders to determine the relative importance of the different components and sub components and the results showed that the stakeholders felt indifferent since they considered all the components equally important the final wpi questionnaire can be found in table a1 of the appendix 3 2 determination of household level wpi principle components analysis pca and factor analysis have been used to create a multi criteria water security index for households senna et al 2019 nadeem et al 2018 sinyolo et al 2014 matshe et al 2013 therefore for this study all the five components of the conventional wpi were reduced using pca to obtain the household level water security index according to achia et al 2010 pca is a multivariate statistical technique used to reduce the number of variables without losing too much information in the process however the use of the conventional pca would have been erroneous since our data were not continuous but were dummy therefore the pca results would not be reliable to remedy this problem we used polychoric pca the first principal component with the largest variation was then used as the independent variable water security index in an ordinary least squares ols to determine the determinants of household income per adult equivalent and in a poisson model to analyse the determinants of water borne disease prevalence in the study area 3 3 determination of the impact of household water security on household welfare to measure welfare we used the household income per adult equivalent where the income per adult equivalent is the total annual household income factored in per adult equivalent terms equivalent scales are the deflators that are used to convert household real incomes into money metric utility measures of individual welfare there are three methods of calculating the adult equivalents behavioural approach subjective approach and arbitrary approach however the first two are considered unreliable due to subjectivity to calculate the household adult equivalents for this study we used the arbitrary approach following the recommendations by deaton and zaidi 1999 the ols regression of the determinants of household income per adult equivalent was specified as follows 2 y i α β x i δ w i ε i where y i is the log household income per adult equivalent for household i x i is a vector of household characteristics α is the intercept and β is the vector of coefficients to be estimated δ is the impact parameter w i is the water security index for household i and ε i is the error term the impact parameter δ shows the change in household income yi as a result of a change in household water security wi to assess the prevalence of water borne diseases the respondents were asked to respond on whether any household member suffered from any of the following illnesses related to water and hygiene malaria diarrhoea stomach ache vomiting cholera typhoid fever and skin and eye infections from the data a count variable for water borne diseases was generated ranging between 0 and 7 depending on the number of the listed illnesses or symptoms and zero if none of the household members experienced any of the said illnesses or symptoms within the reference period as such the assessment of the determinants of the extent of prevalence should be conducted using the poisson regression model greene 2003 therefore the following reduced form poisson regression econometric model was applied to the household data and was specified in equation 3 as follows 3 a β 0 β 1 a g e β 2 g e n d e r β 3 f o r m a l e d u c β 4 h h s i z e β 5 c r e d i t a c c e s s β 6 w a t e r s e c u r i t y i n d e x β 7 s u b c a t c h m e n t ε where a is the number of water borne diseases affecting a particular household in this case 0 7 β 0 is the constant term y intercept β 1 β 7 are the coefficients of the different independent variables and ε is the error term 4 results and discussions 4 1 wpi results of the sub catchment water security 4 1 1 resources component from the findings in table 1 most of the sub catchments are endowed with water resources the results show that the least score achieved for the component of the overall resources was in sirimon sub catchment which had an average of 73 87 while ngare ndare sub catchment had the highest score at 97 07 the overall average score for the resources component was 87 41 however such a high average could be misinterpreted to mean that the upper ewaso ng iro catchment area has no water challenges as such a deeper dive into the sub components reveals interesting findings first the average scores for surface water assessment r1 water quality r5 taste r6 and smell r7 are quite high at 74 14 73 16 77 75 and 83 77 respectively these findings imply that the surface water sources are of good quality fit for consumption and agricultural production secondly there is potential for groundwater exploration to supplement the surface water sources since the average assessment of groundwater r2 is 50 33 third the results show that the average scores for water availability r3 33 86 and reliability r4 44 18 are below the 50 threshold this implies that whereas water resources in the catchment area are of good quality and there is potential for further development most households lack a continuous and reliable water supply and have to bear with rationing and interruptions in the water supply for households to make proper irrigation investment decisions water supply availability and reliability is a prerequisite whereby if water is available and reliable they decide to invest if not they decide to reduce the proportion of land under irrigation or decide not to invest at all due to the inherent risk of crop failure 4 1 2 access component the water access component is a crucial component in the wpi since it helps measure household access to water sanitation and hygiene facilities from the results in table 1 the water access component is generally low since the overall component average is 44 32 less than the 50 threshold the overall access to piped water a1 average was 52 76 however three sub catchments which included rongai 30 77 ewaso narok 35 62 and pesi 37 84 were below the threshold regarding access to a sanitation facility a2 all the sub catchments had an overall 96 66 average however access to irrigation water a3 remained relatively low across all the sub catchments with an overall average of 47 94 and finally where irrigation water was available only 24 28 of the households across the sub catchments had access to irrigation water throughout a4 these findings imply that despite the importance of the access component water access remains low in the upper ennca these low access scores may explain the continued over exploitation and degradation of water resources in the very important catchment areas because water is not enough for household domestic and irrigation needs 4 1 3 capacity component the capacity component seeks to know the household endowment of important assets knowledge and skills that can have a bearing on how the households use and manage the water resources at their disposal all sub catchments are well endowed in terms of capacity whereby the overall capacity score is 65 40 however access to credit c5 is still an impediment with an average of 23 32 4 1 4 uses component the overall score for the uses component is well below the threshold as shown in the results whereby it stands at 38 43 this implies that there is insufficient water for all uses in the catchment area and as such water resources need to be planned allocated and used prudently for posterity from the findings all the sub catchments are quite constrained in the following order ewaso narok 31 54 sirimon 31 61 ngare ndare 36 72 naro moru 39 21 rongai 41 07 timau 41 55 pesi 42 54 and likii 43 22 households are mostly constrained with regard to u2 proportion or land under irrigation 42 47 whereby due to increased water un reliability they are forced to allocate less land to irrigation cropping to minimize losses and risks the other constraint stems from u4 water conflicts in the community in the past one year 28 17 whereby water conflict incidences affected households the worst affected sub catchments are timau 42 22 pesi 32 43 and rongai 38 46 4 1 5 environment component the environment component has an overall mean of 36 92 showing that the upper ennca is quite vulnerable to environmental degradation in the last five years 74 50 of the households were affected by crop loss due to drought 46 99 lost their crop to floods 34 93 lost livestock to drought and 28 21 were affected by soil erosion the different component scores for the different components can be illustrated in a pentagram as shown in fig 3 4 1 6 overall water poverty index while in the previous subsections we have looked at the component scores for each sub catchment here we discuss the overall wpi for the upper ennca as a unit from the computed component indices the water poverty index for the different sub catchments was calculated as shown in the last column of table 1 the overall results show that the overall wpi for the upper ennca is 54 50 this wpi is just on the margin and is not as good since a higher wpi signifies a better status of water resources use and management the distribution of the wpi across sub catchments in descending order is as follows naro moru ngare ndare timau rongai likii pesi ewaso narok and sirimon households in sirimon and ewaso narok are faced with acute water poverty while households in the rest of the sub catchments are faced with moderate water poverty finally the wpi index is depicted using a pentagram as shown in fig 4 to make a visual distribution of water poverty across the sub catchment areas 4 2 determinants of household water security 4 2 1 principal component analysis pca twenty one principal components pcs were extracted using polychoric correlations while only 4 components that had eigenvalues greater than one were retained using the kaiser criterion as shown in table 2 cumulatively the four retained principal components explain 80 of the variance in the data the first pc pc1 explained 38 of the variation with an eigenvalue of 4 724 while pc2 explained 19 of the variation the third component pc3 had an eigenvalue of 1 698 and explained about 14 of the variation and finally pc4 had an eigenvalue of 1 304 and explained 10 of the variation the results of the factor loadings of the four pcs are illustrated in table 3 the results of the factor1 loadings indicated that a majority of the variables are dominant and are positive except for crop loss to drought livestock loss to drought and holding a title deed for land owned from the loadings since pc1 explains much of the variation it is clear that those households which are water secure perceive surface water and groundwater to be very good water should be available throughout should be reliable be of good quality be of very good taste and smell have access to piped water have access to a sanitation facility have access to irrigation water available throughout have sufficient water at all times for household domestic irrigation needs and livestock needs pc1 was used to generate the water security index because it explained the highest variation 37 65 and it captured most of the water security components 4 3 2 ols results of the determinants of household water security the ols results of the determinants of household water security are presented in table 4 the results show that the model is well fit as indicated by a highly significant f value and an r squared r2 value of 0 303 robust standard errors were estimated to take care of heteroscedasticity multicollinearity did not pose a challenge since the model had a low average variance inflation factor vif of 1 30 with the highest vif of 1 93 to test for omitted variable bias ramsey s reset test was carried out the results show that the model has no missing variables since the f value was not significant f 0 26 p 0 857 from the diagnostic tests it was concluded that the ols model estimated coefficients were unbiased consistent and efficient the results showed that wrua membership female adults primary occupation land size income water conflicts irrigation cropping rain fed cropping owning a smartphone and the constant were the positive and significant determinants of household water security wrua membership is positive and significant implying that wrua membership has a positive and significant influence on household water security therefore wrua members had more water security as compared to non members these findings are similar to the findings of speranza et al 2016 who found that community water projects in the upper ewaso ng iro north catchment area largely met the goals of water provision to member households this could be attributed to the fact that wruas and community water projects are the main institutions that are tasked with water allocation and distribution and therefore membership almost guarantees water availability the number of female adults in a household had a positive and significant influence on household water security this implies that households with more female members were less likely to be water insecure this finding is consistent with literature that the water responsibility in the household is mostly women s work and responsibility this result is consistent with previous studies see graham et al 2016 tsukada and hailu 2016 who found that the task of collecting water falls mainly to women and children the primary occupation of the household head had a positive and significant influence on household water security this finding reveals that household heads whose primary occupation was farming were more water secure than households whose primary occupation was not farming this can be explained by the fact that farming households are always at home working and can get enough time to get water as compared to employed households or households engaged in trade away from home land size had a positive and significant influence on household water security households with more land were more water secure than those with less land while sinyolo et al 2014 found the land size to have a positive influence it was not a significant determinant of water security the total household income unscaled had a positive and significant influence on household water security implying that households with more income were more water secure than households with less income this finding is consistent with the findings of sinyolo et al 2014 who found that having more off farm income increased perceived water security since more income implies the ability to pay for water without failure thus improving water security water conflicts according to the results have a highly negative and significant influence on household water security households whose communities had encountered water conflicts had less water security water conflicts have been documented in the study area especially during the dry season when demand for water rises sharply and allocation and distribution fails this finding is also consistent with the findings by sinyolo et al 2014 who found that the occurrence of conflicts had a negative and significant influence on perceived water security irrigation cropping had a positive and significant influence on household water security this finding implies that irrigators were more water secure this can be explained by the commercial nature of irrigation cropping and its ability to generate high returns at minimal risk as compared to rain fed cropping the income generated can be used to pay for water maintenance and development charges install water storage infrastructure on the farm such as water pans water tanks and water saving irrigation infrastructures such as sprinklers and pipes or pumping equipment such as water pumps in on the contrary households dependent on rain fed cropping were water insecure this is due to the negative and significant influence of rain fed cropping on household water security at a significance level of 1 as compared to irrigation cropping rain fed cropping is highly risky and prone to failure due to the challenges posed by climate change and unpredictable weather patterns finally owning a smartphone had a positive and significant influence on household water security this finding shows the importance of mobile connectivity to development smartphones are devices with several capabilities such as telephone mobile money radio internet and customized applications apps for different uses owing to the many capabilities the households can get information on water availability water conservation access mobile loans to pay for water or even pay water charges using mobile money ending up with more water security baumüller 2012 argued that information regarding the existence of new agricultural technologies is of course a prerequisite for technology adoption such information can be obtained from various external sources such as extension agents fellow farmers or different media such as mobile phones tv or radio in the case of our study the mobile phone seems to have a major role in providing connectivity for water security 4 3 impact of water security on household income per adult equivalent the results of the impact of water security on household income per adult equivalent are presented in table 5 the results show that the model is well fit as indicated by a highly significant f value and an r squared r2 value of 0 228 robust standard errors were estimated to take care of heteroscedasticity multicollinearity did not pose a challenge since the model had a low average variance inflation factor vif of 1 13 with the highest vif of 1 34 to test for omitted variable bias ramsey s reset test was carried out the results show that the model has no missing variables since the f value was not significant f 0 08 p 0 97 from the diagnostic tests it was concluded that the ols model estimated coefficients were unbiased consistent and efficient the regression results on the impact of water security on household income per adult equivalent show a positive and significant relationship this finding implies that water secure households are likely to have higher incomes as compared to water insecure households all factors held constant we therefore accept the hypothesis that there is a relationship between water security and household income per adult equivalent in the upper ennca previous studies have shown that water security is strongly related to household welfare katuva et al 2020 brewis et al 2020 tsukada and hailu 2016 the other positive and significant factors that influence household income per adult equivalent include age squared access to extension services access to credit smartphone ownership and growing improved crop varieties the negative and significant factors that influence the household income per adult equivalent include age primary occupation and the main source of cooking fuel being firewood the results reveal that farmers with access to extension services had more incomes than farmers without access this finding demonstrates the important role that extension plays on household welfare and rural household livelihoods this finding concurs with the findings by gebrehiwot 2015 who found that access to extension services had an incremental impact on household incomes access to credit had a positive influence on household income this implies that households with access to credit could obtain output improving inputs such as improved seeds fertilizer artificial insemination ai among other capital intensive inputs in advance either in cash or in kind and pay later therefore access to credit ensures that the production cycle is smooth and is uninterrupted previous studies have demonstrated the impacts of access to credit as an enabler for household welfare and poverty alleviation teka and lee 2020 other studies have demonstrated the links between credit access and adoption of new technologies and improved crop varieties darkwah et al 2019 danso abbeam et al 2017 matuschke et al 2007 households owning a smartphone were more likely to have higher income per adult equivalent than households without implying that households with smartphones have more information at their disposal due to the multiple application capabilities of smartphones i e call message internet social media farming applications mobile money mobile banking among other uses previous studies have documented a positive influence of smartphones on household income mwaura et al 2020 teka and lee 2020 further households growing improved crops were more likely to have higher income per adult equivalent than households that do not grow improved crop varieties this finding was expected since improved crop varieties are fast maturing offer resistance to pests diseases and drought while at the same time producing higher yields previous studies have documented household welfare effects attributable to the adoption of improved crops wossen et al 2019 shiferaw et al 2014 while old household heads had a lower income per adult equivalent than households with younger heads the age squared was significant and positive this finding implies that age has a diminishing impact on household income per adult equivalent this finding is consistent with the findings by tuyen 2015 who found that the age of the household head has a diminishing impact on household income per capita the results further show that households whose primary occupation is farming were likely to have a lower household income per adult equivalent as compared to non farming households this finding is consistent with economic theory since primary production is of low value as compared to secondary and tertiary production this finding is consistent with the findings by tuyen 2015 who found that there is a negative relationship between household income per capita and farming as the primary occupation finally households whose main source of cooking fuel was firewood were likely to have lower income per adult equivalent as compared to households using improved sources this finding is consistent with the findings by morrissey 2017 that it is the poor who are highly dependent on unimproved energy sources in sub saharan africa 4 4 impact of water security on water borne disease prevalence the results of the poisson regression model are shown in table 6 the coefficient for the water security index is negative and significant the results show that improvements in the water security index have a reducing effect on the household prevalence of water borne diseases these results imply that water secure households are likely to have a lower extent of water borne disease burden we therefore accept the hypothesis that there is a relationship between water security and the prevalence of water related diseases in the upper ennca this finding is consistent with the findings by rosengrant 2020 bain et al 2014 and collins et al 2007 on the effects of water security and management on the prevalence of waterborne diseases households headed by older household heads were less likely to have a heavy water borne disease burden this result implies two things first old age comes with more experience and secondly older household heads are aware and understand the risks posed by low quality water and stagnant water and therefore put in place safety measures to safeguard their households further male headed households mhhs were less likely to have a heavy water borne disease burden as compared to female headed households fhhs this un even vulnerability to the exposure of water borne diseases is attributable to the differential resource endowments between mhhs and fhhs as documented by previous studies pouramin et al 2020 caruso et al 2015 according to caruso et al 2015 women s vulnerability in water matters arises due to the inequitable division of power work access and control of resources between men and women women s exposure to water borne diseases is further reinforced by the risk of physical assault when fetching water such as rape and sexual assault and as a result due to women s physical vulnerability to such assaults fhhs may end up using un safe water sources which they perceive as safe for personal safety and security households with more members were likely to have a higher water borne disease burden as compared to smaller sized households larger households share household resources including water and sanitation facilities food beddings and utensils therefore where hygiene standards are low diseases spread quite fast especially communicable water borne diseases like diarrhoea and vomiting finally sub catchments with a positive and significant probability of having a higher prevalence of water borne diseases include rongai likii timau and ngare ndare 5 conclusions the wpi results revealed that sirimon and ewaso narok sub catchments were faced with acute water poverty while the rest of the sub catchments were faced with moderate water poverty despite being in the sub catchment area further the study assessed the drivers of household water security the results revealed that wrua membership female adults primary occupation land size income water conflicts irrigation cropping rain fed cropping owning a smartphone were the significant factors that determined household water security the factors that influenced household income per adult equivalent positively included water security age squared access to extension services access to credit smartphone ownership and growing improved crop varieties the negative and significant factors that influenced the household income per adult equivalent included age primary occupation and the main source of cooking fuel being firewood finally the factors that influenced the prevalence of water related diseases negatively included age of the household head gender of the household head and the household water security index the positive factors that influenced the prevalence of water borne diseases were the household size and the following sub catchments which were found to have a significantly higher probability of having a higher prevalence of water borne diseases including rongai likii timau and ngare ndare 5 1 policy recommendations the wpi results provide evidence that there are existential threats to water security in the upper ewaso ng iro north catchment area which need urgent action due to the relative importance of the upper ennca to the whole ewaso ng iro north river basin most of which is asal the welfare assessment results have shown that improvements in water security can offer welfare benefits to households since evidence has shown that improved water security can offer both economic and health benefits to households as a result improvements in water security could offer solutions to some of the country s problems including poverty alleviation and reduced budget spending on communicable and non communicable water related diseases however it is important to note that water security improvement would come at a social cost to both the households and the government which should be quantified before rolling out any programmes aimed at water security improvement the study makes the following policy recommendations the government should prioritize sensitization campaigns for the conservation of the upper ennca since water insecurity at the catchment area spells doom for the middle and lower basin all of which are asal areas these campaigns should focus on the restriction of land use changes controlling of soil erosion tree planting forest conservation on farm water conservation and collaborative water resources management for ecologically sound downstream flows secondly since water is a devolved function to the county governments county governments should continue making water investments since these investments are worthwhile from both economic and health perspectives this calls for increased budgetary allocation to provide irrigation and domestic water to all households thirdly counties should also invest in water treatment and sewerage treatment plants fourth social safety net programmes should focus more on the vulnerable from the results households headed by the old and female headed households should be given special attention among other vulnerable groups access to affordable and accessible credit remains one of the key ways to increase household incomes the government should provide a proper legislative framework and rethink interest rate caps finally the results have shown that wrua membership is a key determinant of water security therefore the government through concerned agencies should consider the agency role played by wruas in the water governance framework and increase wrua capacity through training and budgetary facilitation funding this work was carried out with the support of the adb mohest egerton university project on staff training at master and doctoral level in agricultural and livestock biosciences scholarship the centre for training

20053,water insecurity is a major concern both in the global and local contexts the study estimated the sub catchment water poverty index and the household water security index on cross sectional farm household data collected from 652 households randomly selected from eight sub catchments of the upper ewaso ng iro north catchment area ennca the impact of water security on household income per adult equivalent and prevalence of waterborne diseases was assessed using ordinary least squares regression and poisson regression models respectively water poverty index wpi results revealed that sirimon and ewaso narok sub catchments are faced with acute water stress while the rest of the sub catchments are faced with moderate water stress despite being in the sub catchment area the results showed that improved water security can offer welfare benefits to households through increments in household income and reduced water borne disease prevalence from the findings therefore improved water security can offer both economic and health solutions to some of the country s problems including poverty alleviation and reduce the government s budget spending on communicable and non communicable water related diseases keywords water security water poverty index waterborne diseases 1 introduction small holder irrigation has been proven to be a pathway out of poverty and inequality with the returns on irrigation investments in sub saharan africa ssa ranging from 17 per cent for large scale farmers to 43 per cent for small scale farmers with the ability to triple per capita farm incomes resulting in significant impacts on poverty reduction world bank group 2019 despite the huge potential of irrigation cropping water scarcity is becoming a challenge across the globe kummu et al 2016 falkenmark 2013 falkenmark et al 1998 and more so in ssa agriculture is a key contributor to rural incomes in kenya with a majority of rural households depending on farming for their livelihoods gok 2019 world bank group 2019 nyoro 2002 kenya is faced with several water related challenges which include climate variability growing population catchment degradation pollution and invasive species un water wwap 2006 water demand has also risen sharply due to increased water uses and users across sectors such as energy construction and domestic use misra 2014 strzepek and boehlert 2010 according to davies and gustaffson 2015 despite the country having some of the greatest water towers in the region 90 per cent of the country is either arid or semi arid asal further local water stress is a challenge not only in the asal areas but also in more water rich regions where water intensive economic activities have grown rapidly the upper ennca included davies and gustaffson 2015 mungai et al 2004 gichuki 2002 the benefits of improved water security cannot be overstated previous studies have shown evidence of a positive and significant relationship between water security and improved household food security nutrition livelihoods and welfare rosegrant 2020 brewis et al 2020 hadush 2018 wfp 2017 pérez escamilla 2017 sinyolo et al 2014 fao cfs 2015 cosgrove and loucks 2015 fanadzo

due to effective management of multiple water uses and wastewater rosegrant 2020 bain et al 2014 collins et al 2007 finally according to cooper 2020 strengthening water security is essential for preventing and combating future pandemics including the current covid 19 pandemic since handwashing is one of the key measures to suppress the spread of covid 19 while water security is a concern the main challenge in research circles is the measurement of household water insecurity and establishing its effects on household welfare since researchers and practitioners have few tools to quantitatively measure assess and compare the scope and scale of household and individual water insecurity across cultural and climatic variations jepson et al 2017 further jepson et al 2017 notes that water insecurity metrics can be categorized into four conceptual domains human development sustainability geopolitics and vulnerability while our scale of interest is the sub catchment level and the unit of study is the household we therefore use the water poverty index wpi to measure water security for three reasons first is that it follows the human development concept in its approach jepson et al 2017 sullivan 2002 and secondly it uses a holistic approach since it considers available water resources the access to the water resources the capacity to manage the water resources the current uses of the available water resources in including shortfalls and any environmental factors that may affect water resource availability finally it can be used to measure household water security through the use of principal component analysis pca and factor analysis garriga and foguet 2010 previous studies have used the wpi in economic analysis senna et al 2019 sinyolo et al 2014 matshe et al 2013 garriga and foguet 2010 sullivan 2002 the novelty of this study is that it will generate new discourse about water security or insecurity thereof in water catchment areas which are mostly perceived to be water secure on the basic classification as water catchment areas this study therefore sought to add more knowledge to the existing knowledge on the measurement of household water security and extend the same to assess the impacts of water security on household welfare through a quantitative analysis approach in consideration that welfare is quite broad and multidimensional we use household income per adult equivalent and prevalence of water borne diseases as proxies for welfare the study has the following objectives to determine sub catchment water security in the upper ennca to assess the impact of household water security on household income per adult equivalent and to assess the impact of household water security on the prevalence of water borne diseases in the upper ennca the study has the following hypothesis there is a relationship between household level water security and household income per adult equivalent in the upper ennca there is a relationship between household level water security and the prevalence of water borne diseases in the upper ennca 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area the study was undertaken in the upper ewaso ng iro north catchment area ennca which is the catchment area for the ewaso ng iro river basin the ewaso ng iro river basin is the largest in kenya ennda 2019 it covers an area of about 210 226 km2 which is about 36 of the total area of kenya s 576 000 km2 it is the largest of all the six basin areas but with the least population this is because it falls in arid and semi arid asal parts of kenya altitude ranges from 150 m at the lorian swamp to 5 199 m at the peak of mount kenya the map of the ewaso ng iro north basin is shown in fig 1 the map shows the upper middle and lower basin areas from the map the importance of the upper catchment area cannot be overemphasized since it serves a large portion of the country which is mostly arid and semi arid areas asal according to mungai et al 2004 the upper ewaso ng iro north basin is located to the north and west of mount kenya extending to the aberdare ranges between longitudes 36030 e and 37045 e and latitudes 0015 n and 1000 n the map of the upper ewaso ng iro north catchment area is shown in fig 2 the catchment area is divided into 21 sub catchment areas as shown the upper catchment area is highly utilized for agricultural production due to favourable weather conditions fertile soils and irrigation water availability through river abstractions the main economic activity in upper ewaso ng iro north catchment is small scale farming rain fed and irrigation small scale fishery and pastoralism the area ranges from high potential high altitude to low potential arid and semi arid zones due to the arid nature of most parts of the basin the atmospheric demand for water is very high ericksen et al 2012 mutiga et al 2010 2 2 sampling strategy and sample frame data was collected in the period between september 2019 and february 2020 from a sample of 652 households a multistage sampling technique was employed in the study in the first stage eight sub catchments were sampled randomly out of the twenty one sub catchments of the upper ennca as a result the following sub catchments were sampled ewaso narok pesi rongai naromoru likii timau sirimon and ngare ndare in the second stage stratified sampling was done disproportionately to the population size of the sampled sub catchments since the number of households in each sub catchment was unknown finally simple random sampling was undertaken using a list from the wruas 2 3 types of data and data sources this study utilized both primary and secondary data sources primary data was collected from households wruas and key informants secondary data was collected from sources such as books journals and reports data collected for the study included household data group data farm produce data and income data a semi structured questionnaire was administered to the small scale farmers by trained enumerators using the world bank s computer aided personal interview capi program through face to face interviews data for the study were analyzed using stata version 15 0 statistical software 3 analytical framework 3 1 determination of sub catchment water security to determine sub catchment water security in the upper ennca kenya the water poverty index wpi was calculated for each of the sampled sub catchments following korc and ford 2013 the water poverty index wpi is a composite index principally designed to assist decision makers at different levels in developing and targeting interventions that aim to increase water security for the poor matshe et al 2013 sullivan et al 2003 the wpi stems from a realization that assessing households access to water requires a holistic approach that takes into consideration not only whether or not a household has access to water but also issues relating to water quality and variability multiple uses of water households capacity to manage water as well as environmental and spatial scale aspects related to water according to korc and ford 2013 wpi as a water management tool has found great relevance in policy formulation primarily in resource allocation and prioritization processes particularly in water poor countries like kenya in proposing a wpi that considers these aspects sullivan et al 2003 identify via a community participatory approach the following five components as key to a holistic wpi resources r this component captures the physical availability of both surface and groundwater access a this component considers access to water for human use drinking and nondrinking capacity c this component relates to the ability of people to manage water use u this component considers the multiple uses of water and environment e this component seeks to factor in environmental integrity related to water resources these five components are used to construct a wpi sullivan et al 2003 argue that the construction of the wpi should follow a structure similar to that of the human development index hdi specifically each component is constructed via the following general formula 1 wpi ϖ i i 1 n w i c i i 1 n w i where for each household wpi and ϖi refers to the water poverty index c i refers to component i of the household s wpi with i resources r access a capacity c use u and environment e while wi is the weight applied to that particular component the scores of each component are calculated using the average of all the sub components in each for instance the resources component has seven subcomponents for each sub catchment that is r1 to r7 as shown in table 1 one of the key challenges in the calculation of the wpi is the assignment of the respective weights to the components according to sullivan 2002 sullivan et al 2003 and sullivan and meigh 2007 assignment of equal weights is preferred to avoid problems of subjectivity since weights are applied to indicate the relative importance of a particular component in the wpi for the current study we used equal weights for two reasons the first is because of the recommendations by sullivan and meigh 2007 secondly during the piloting phase we conducted three focus group discussions with different stakeholders to determine the relative importance of the different components and sub components and the results showed that the stakeholders felt indifferent since they considered all the components equally important the final wpi questionnaire can be found in table a1 of the appendix 3 2 determination of household level wpi principle components analysis pca and factor analysis have been used to create a multi criteria water security index for households senna et al 2019 nadeem et al 2018 sinyolo et al 2014 matshe et al 2013 therefore for this study all the five components of the conventional wpi were reduced using pca to obtain the household level water security index according to achia et al 2010 pca is a multivariate statistical technique used to reduce the number of variables without losing too much information in the process however the use of the conventional pca would have been erroneous since our data were not continuous but were dummy therefore the pca results would not be reliable to remedy this problem we used polychoric pca the first principal component with the largest variation was then used as the independent variable water security index in an ordinary least squares ols to determine the determinants of household income per adult equivalent and in a poisson model to analyse the determinants of water borne disease prevalence in the study area 3 3 determination of the impact of household water security on household welfare to measure welfare we used the household income per adult equivalent where the income per adult equivalent is the total annual household income factored in per adult equivalent terms equivalent scales are the deflators that are used to convert household real incomes into money metric utility measures of individual welfare there are three methods of calculating the adult equivalents behavioural approach subjective approach and arbitrary approach however the first two are considered unreliable due to subjectivity to calculate the household adult equivalents for this study we used the arbitrary approach following the recommendations by deaton and zaidi 1999 the ols regression of the determinants of household income per adult equivalent was specified as follows 2 y i α β x i δ w i ε i where y i is the log household income per adult equivalent for household i x i is a vector of household characteristics α is the intercept and β is the vector of coefficients to be estimated δ is the impact parameter w i is the water security index for household i and ε i is the error term the impact parameter δ shows the change in household income yi as a result of a change in household water security wi to assess the prevalence of water borne diseases the respondents were asked to respond on whether any household member suffered from any of the following illnesses related to water and hygiene malaria diarrhoea stomach ache vomiting cholera typhoid fever and skin and eye infections from the data a count variable for water borne diseases was generated ranging between 0 and 7 depending on the number of the listed illnesses or symptoms and zero if none of the household members experienced any of the said illnesses or symptoms within the reference period as such the assessment of the determinants of the extent of prevalence should be conducted using the poisson regression model greene 2003 therefore the following reduced form poisson regression econometric model was applied to the household data and was specified in equation 3 as follows 3 a β 0 β 1 a g e β 2 g e n d e r β 3 f o r m a l e d u c β 4 h h s i z e β 5 c r e d i t a c c e s s β 6 w a t e r s e c u r i t y i n d e x β 7 s u b c a t c h m e n t ε where a is the number of water borne diseases affecting a particular household in this case 0 7 β 0 is the constant term y intercept β 1 β 7 are the coefficients of the different independent variables and ε is the error term 4 results and discussions 4 1 wpi results of the sub catchment water security 4 1 1 resources component from the findings in table 1 most of the sub catchments are endowed with water resources the results show that the least score achieved for the component of the overall resources was in sirimon sub catchment which had an average of 73 87 while ngare ndare sub catchment had the highest score at 97 07 the overall average score for the resources component was 87 41 however such a high average could be misinterpreted to mean that the upper ewaso ng iro catchment area has no water challenges as such a deeper dive into the sub components reveals interesting findings first the average scores for surface water assessment r1 water quality r5 taste r6 and smell r7 are quite high at 74 14 73 16 77 75 and 83 77 respectively these findings imply that the surface water sources are of good quality fit for consumption and agricultural production secondly there is potential for groundwater exploration to supplement the surface water sources since the average assessment of groundwater r2 is 50 33 third the results show that the average scores for water availability r3 33 86 and reliability r4 44 18 are below the 50 threshold this implies that whereas water resources in the catchment area are of good quality and there is potential for further development most households lack a continuous and reliable water supply and have to bear with rationing and interruptions in the water supply for households to make proper irrigation investment decisions water supply availability and reliability is a prerequisite whereby if water is available and reliable they decide to invest if not they decide to reduce the proportion of land under irrigation or decide not to invest at all due to the inherent risk of crop failure 4 1 2 access component the water access component is a crucial component in the wpi since it helps measure household access to water sanitation and hygiene facilities from the results in table 1 the water access component is generally low since the overall component average is 44 32 less than the 50 threshold the overall access to piped water a1 average was 52 76 however three sub catchments which included rongai 30 77 ewaso narok 35 62 and pesi 37 84 were below the threshold regarding access to a sanitation facility a2 all the sub catchments had an overall 96 66 average however access to irrigation water a3 remained relatively low across all the sub catchments with an overall average of 47 94 and finally where irrigation water was available only 24 28 of the households across the sub catchments had access to irrigation water throughout a4 these findings imply that despite the importance of the access component water access remains low in the upper ennca these low access scores may explain the continued over exploitation and degradation of water resources in the very important catchment areas because water is not enough for household domestic and irrigation needs 4 1 3 capacity component the capacity component seeks to know the household endowment of important assets knowledge and skills that can have a bearing on how the households use and manage the water resources at their disposal all sub catchments are well endowed in terms of capacity whereby the overall capacity score is 65 40 however access to credit c5 is still an impediment with an average of 23 32 4 1 4 uses component the overall score for the uses component is well below the threshold as shown in the results whereby it stands at 38 43 this implies that there is insufficient water for all uses in the catchment area and as such water resources need to be planned allocated and used prudently for posterity from the findings all the sub catchments are quite constrained in the following order ewaso narok 31 54 sirimon 31 61 ngare ndare 36 72 naro moru 39 21 rongai 41 07 timau 41 55 pesi 42 54 and likii 43 22 households are mostly constrained with regard to u2 proportion or land under irrigation 42 47 whereby due to increased water un reliability they are forced to allocate less land to irrigation cropping to minimize losses and risks the other constraint stems from u4 water conflicts in the community in the past one year 28 17 whereby water conflict incidences affected households the worst affected sub catchments are timau 42 22 pesi 32 43 and rongai 38 46 4 1 5 environment component the environment component has an overall mean of 36 92 showing that the upper ennca is quite vulnerable to environmental degradation in the last five years 74 50 of the households were affected by crop loss due to drought 46 99 lost their crop to floods 34 93 lost livestock to drought and 28 21 were affected by soil erosion the different component scores for the different components can be illustrated in a pentagram as shown in fig 3 4 1 6 overall water poverty index while in the previous subsections we have looked at the component scores for each sub catchment here we discuss the overall wpi for the upper ennca as a unit from the computed component indices the water poverty index for the different sub catchments was calculated as shown in the last column of table 1 the overall results show that the overall wpi for the upper ennca is 54 50 this wpi is just on the margin and is not as good since a higher wpi signifies a better status of water resources use and management the distribution of the wpi across sub catchments in descending order is as follows naro moru ngare ndare timau rongai likii pesi ewaso narok and sirimon households in sirimon and ewaso narok are faced with acute water poverty while households in the rest of the sub catchments are faced with moderate water poverty finally the wpi index is depicted using a pentagram as shown in fig 4 to make a visual distribution of water poverty across the sub catchment areas 4 2 determinants of household water security 4 2 1 principal component analysis pca twenty one principal components pcs were extracted using polychoric correlations while only 4 components that had eigenvalues greater than one were retained using the kaiser criterion as shown in table 2 cumulatively the four retained principal components explain 80 of the variance in the data the first pc pc1 explained 38 of the variation with an eigenvalue of 4 724 while pc2 explained 19 of the variation the third component pc3 had an eigenvalue of 1 698 and explained about 14 of the variation and finally pc4 had an eigenvalue of 1 304 and explained 10 of the variation the results of the factor loadings of the four pcs are illustrated in table 3 the results of the factor1 loadings indicated that a majority of the variables are dominant and are positive except for crop loss to drought livestock loss to drought and holding a title deed for land owned from the loadings since pc1 explains much of the variation it is clear that those households which are water secure perceive surface water and groundwater to be very good water should be available throughout should be reliable be of good quality be of very good taste and smell have access to piped water have access to a sanitation facility have access to irrigation water available throughout have sufficient water at all times for household domestic irrigation needs and livestock needs pc1 was used to generate the water security index because it explained the highest variation 37 65 and it captured most of the water security components 4 3 2 ols results of the determinants of household water security the ols results of the determinants of household water security are presented in table 4 the results show that the model is well fit as indicated by a highly significant f value and an r squared r2 value of 0 303 robust standard errors were estimated to take care of heteroscedasticity multicollinearity did not pose a challenge since the model had a low average variance inflation factor vif of 1 30 with the highest vif of 1 93 to test for omitted variable bias ramsey s reset test was carried out the results show that the model has no missing variables since the f value was not significant f 0 26 p 0 857 from the diagnostic tests it was concluded that the ols model estimated coefficients were unbiased consistent and efficient the results showed that wrua membership female adults primary occupation land size income water conflicts irrigation cropping rain fed cropping owning a smartphone and the constant were the positive and significant determinants of household water security wrua membership is positive and significant implying that wrua membership has a positive and significant influence on household water security therefore wrua members had more water security as compared to non members these findings are similar to the findings of speranza et al 2016 who found that community water projects in the upper ewaso ng iro north catchment area largely met the goals of water provision to member households this could be attributed to the fact that wruas and community water projects are the main institutions that are tasked with water allocation and distribution and therefore membership almost guarantees water availability the number of female adults in a household had a positive and significant influence on household water security this implies that households with more female members were less likely to be water insecure this finding is consistent with literature that the water responsibility in the household is mostly women s work and responsibility this result is consistent with previous studies see graham et al 2016 tsukada and hailu 2016 who found that the task of collecting water falls mainly to women and children the primary occupation of the household head had a positive and significant influence on household water security this finding reveals that household heads whose primary occupation was farming were more water secure than households whose primary occupation was not farming this can be explained by the fact that farming households are always at home working and can get enough time to get water as compared to employed households or households engaged in trade away from home land size had a positive and significant influence on household water security households with more land were more water secure than those with less land while sinyolo et al 2014 found the land size to have a positive influence it was not a significant determinant of water security the total household income unscaled had a positive and significant influence on household water security implying that households with more income were more water secure than households with less income this finding is consistent with the findings of sinyolo et al 2014 who found that having more off farm income increased perceived water security since more income implies the ability to pay for water without failure thus improving water security water conflicts according to the results have a highly negative and significant influence on household water security households whose communities had encountered water conflicts had less water security water conflicts have been documented in the study area especially during the dry season when demand for water rises sharply and allocation and distribution fails this finding is also consistent with the findings by sinyolo et al 2014 who found that the occurrence of conflicts had a negative and significant influence on perceived water security irrigation cropping had a positive and significant influence on household water security this finding implies that irrigators were more water secure this can be explained by the commercial nature of irrigation cropping and its ability to generate high returns at minimal risk as compared to rain fed cropping the income generated can be used to pay for water maintenance and development charges install water storage infrastructure on the farm such as water pans water tanks and water saving irrigation infrastructures such as sprinklers and pipes or pumping equipment such as water pumps in on the contrary households dependent on rain fed cropping were water insecure this is due to the negative and significant influence of rain fed cropping on household water security at a significance level of 1 as compared to irrigation cropping rain fed cropping is highly risky and prone to failure due to the challenges posed by climate change and unpredictable weather patterns finally owning a smartphone had a positive and significant influence on household water security this finding shows the importance of mobile connectivity to development smartphones are devices with several capabilities such as telephone mobile money radio internet and customized applications apps for different uses owing to the many capabilities the households can get information on water availability water conservation access mobile loans to pay for water or even pay water charges using mobile money ending up with more water security baumüller 2012 argued that information regarding the existence of new agricultural technologies is of course a prerequisite for technology adoption such information can be obtained from various external sources such as extension agents fellow farmers or different media such as mobile phones tv or radio in the case of our study the mobile phone seems to have a major role in providing connectivity for water security 4 3 impact of water security on household income per adult equivalent the results of the impact of water security on household income per adult equivalent are presented in table 5 the results show that the model is well fit as indicated by a highly significant f value and an r squared r2 value of 0 228 robust standard errors were estimated to take care of heteroscedasticity multicollinearity did not pose a challenge since the model had a low average variance inflation factor vif of 1 13 with the highest vif of 1 34 to test for omitted variable bias ramsey s reset test was carried out the results show that the model has no missing variables since the f value was not significant f 0 08 p 0 97 from the diagnostic tests it was concluded that the ols model estimated coefficients were unbiased consistent and efficient the regression results on the impact of water security on household income per adult equivalent show a positive and significant relationship this finding implies that water secure households are likely to have higher incomes as compared to water insecure households all factors held constant we therefore accept the hypothesis that there is a relationship between water security and household income per adult equivalent in the upper ennca previous studies have shown that water security is strongly related to household welfare katuva et al 2020 brewis et al 2020 tsukada and hailu 2016 the other positive and significant factors that influence household income per adult equivalent include age squared access to extension services access to credit smartphone ownership and growing improved crop varieties the negative and significant factors that influence the household income per adult equivalent include age primary occupation and the main source of cooking fuel being firewood the results reveal that farmers with access to extension services had more incomes than farmers without access this finding demonstrates the important role that extension plays on household welfare and rural household livelihoods this finding concurs with the findings by gebrehiwot 2015 who found that access to extension services had an incremental impact on household incomes access to credit had a positive influence on household income this implies that households with access to credit could obtain output improving inputs such as improved seeds fertilizer artificial insemination ai among other capital intensive inputs in advance either in cash or in kind and pay later therefore access to credit ensures that the production cycle is smooth and is uninterrupted previous studies have demonstrated the impacts of access to credit as an enabler for household welfare and poverty alleviation teka and lee 2020 other studies have demonstrated the links between credit access and adoption of new technologies and improved crop varieties darkwah et al 2019 danso abbeam et al 2017 matuschke et al 2007 households owning a smartphone were more likely to have higher income per adult equivalent than households without implying that households with smartphones have more information at their disposal due to the multiple application capabilities of smartphones i e call message internet social media farming applications mobile money mobile banking among other uses previous studies have documented a positive influence of smartphones on household income mwaura et al 2020 teka and lee 2020 further households growing improved crops were more likely to have higher income per adult equivalent than households that do not grow improved crop varieties this finding was expected since improved crop varieties are fast maturing offer resistance to pests diseases and drought while at the same time producing higher yields previous studies have documented household welfare effects attributable to the adoption of improved crops wossen et al 2019 shiferaw et al 2014 while old household heads had a lower income per adult equivalent than households with younger heads the age squared was significant and positive this finding implies that age has a diminishing impact on household income per adult equivalent this finding is consistent with the findings by tuyen 2015 who found that the age of the household head has a diminishing impact on household income per capita the results further show that households whose primary occupation is farming were likely to have a lower household income per adult equivalent as compared to non farming households this finding is consistent with economic theory since primary production is of low value as compared to secondary and tertiary production this finding is consistent with the findings by tuyen 2015 who found that there is a negative relationship between household income per capita and farming as the primary occupation finally households whose main source of cooking fuel was firewood were likely to have lower income per adult equivalent as compared to households using improved sources this finding is consistent with the findings by morrissey 2017 that it is the poor who are highly dependent on unimproved energy sources in sub saharan africa 4 4 impact of water security on water borne disease prevalence the results of the poisson regression model are shown in table 6 the coefficient for the water security index is negative and significant the results show that improvements in the water security index have a reducing effect on the household prevalence of water borne diseases these results imply that water secure households are likely to have a lower extent of water borne disease burden we therefore accept the hypothesis that there is a relationship between water security and the prevalence of water related diseases in the upper ennca this finding is consistent with the findings by rosengrant 2020 bain et al 2014 and collins et al 2007 on the effects of water security and management on the prevalence of waterborne diseases households headed by older household heads were less likely to have a heavy water borne disease burden this result implies two things first old age comes with more experience and secondly older household heads are aware and understand the risks posed by low quality water and stagnant water and therefore put in place safety measures to safeguard their households further male headed households mhhs were less likely to have a heavy water borne disease burden as compared to female headed households fhhs this un even vulnerability to the exposure of water borne diseases is attributable to the differential resource endowments between mhhs and fhhs as documented by previous studies pouramin et al 2020 caruso et al 2015 according to caruso et al 2015 women s vulnerability in water matters arises due to the inequitable division of power work access and control of resources between men and women women s exposure to water borne diseases is further reinforced by the risk of physical assault when fetching water such as rape and sexual assault and as a result due to women s physical vulnerability to such assaults fhhs may end up using un safe water sources which they perceive as safe for personal safety and security households with more members were likely to have a higher water borne disease burden as compared to smaller sized households larger households share household resources including water and sanitation facilities food beddings and utensils therefore where hygiene standards are low diseases spread quite fast especially communicable water borne diseases like diarrhoea and vomiting finally sub catchments with a positive and significant probability of having a higher prevalence of water borne diseases include rongai likii timau and ngare ndare 5 conclusions the wpi results revealed that sirimon and ewaso narok sub catchments were faced with acute water poverty while the rest of the sub catchments were faced with moderate water poverty despite being in the sub catchment area further the study assessed the drivers of household water security the results revealed that wrua membership female adults primary occupation land size income water conflicts irrigation cropping rain fed cropping owning a smartphone were the significant factors that determined household water security the factors that influenced household income per adult equivalent positively included water security age squared access to extension services access to credit smartphone ownership and growing improved crop varieties the negative and significant factors that influenced the household income per adult equivalent included age primary occupation and the main source of cooking fuel being firewood finally the factors that influenced the prevalence of water related diseases negatively included age of the household head gender of the household head and the household water security index the positive factors that influenced the prevalence of water borne diseases were the household size and the following sub catchments which were found to have a significantly higher probability of having a higher prevalence of water borne diseases including rongai likii timau and ngare ndare 5 1 policy recommendations the wpi results provide evidence that there are existential threats to water security in the upper ewaso ng iro north catchment area which need urgent action due to the relative importance of the upper ennca to the whole ewaso ng iro north river basin most of which is asal the welfare assessment results have shown that improvements in water security can offer welfare benefits to households since evidence has shown that improved water security can offer both economic and health benefits to households as a result improvements in water security could offer solutions to some of the country s problems including poverty alleviation and reduced budget spending on communicable and non communicable water related diseases however it is important to note that water security improvement would come at a social cost to both the households and the government which should be quantified before rolling out any programmes aimed at water security improvement the study makes the following policy recommendations the government should prioritize sensitization campaigns for the conservation of the upper ennca since water insecurity at the catchment area spells doom for the middle and lower basin all of which are asal areas these campaigns should focus on the restriction of land use changes controlling of soil erosion tree planting forest conservation on farm water conservation and collaborative water resources management for ecologically sound downstream flows secondly since water is a devolved function to the county governments county governments should continue making water investments since these investments are worthwhile from both economic and health perspectives this calls for increased budgetary allocation to provide irrigation and domestic water to all households thirdly counties should also invest in water treatment and sewerage treatment plants fourth social safety net programmes should focus more on the vulnerable from the results households headed by the old and female headed households should be given special attention among other vulnerable groups access to affordable and accessible credit remains one of the key ways to increase household incomes the government should provide a proper legislative framework and rethink interest rate caps finally the results have shown that wrua membership is a key determinant of water security therefore the government through concerned agencies should consider the agency role played by wruas in the water governance framework and increase wrua capacity through training and budgetary facilitation funding this work was

20054,ecological processes and distribution of biodiversity within river floodplains are driven by the hydrological regime of the area the relationship between fish abundance diversity and surface water quality at four impact points of the sashadanga oxbow lake was examined based on hydrological connectivity distance of lake sections from parent channel density of buffer vegetation and hydrological phases of seasons fish sample populations n 1440 belonging to 10 orders showed greater numerical abundance in the pre and post flooding phases oxbow sites proximal to the parent channel showed higher comprehensive pollution index cpi higher dominance and lower species evenness during the pre monsoon minor flooding and vice versa during the monsoon and post monsoon greater flooding periods diversity descriptors using curve asymptote based on hill s numbers indicate significant site specific fish diversity within the oxbow lake at different seasons discriminant analysis revealed that change in temperature turbidity and concentration of inorganic nitrogen were significant predictors in differentiating the quality of the different sites of the lake principal component analysis pca revealed that the relative abundance of each species order across sites was significantly influenced by changes in seasons and physicochemical parameters and showed a weak association with the density of buffer vegetation at sites depending on the distance of oxbow areas to the parent channel the combination of periodic flooding riparian buffer and lake morphology define the degree of hydrological connectivity which in turn affects the composition and abundance of fish communities at different points of the lake keywords flooding periods parent channel riparian vegetation species

been documented gotelli and chao 2013 kondratyeva et al 2019 although the interdependence between river channels and floodplain lakes is determined by periodical flooding and fluctuations in the water level aspetsberger et al 2002 the morphology of oxbows is also a determinant factor in the exchange of matter obolewski et al 2016 periodic hydrological events and temporary connectivity formed during flood seasons could cause marked gradients in habitat conditions across different parts of the lake amoros and bornette 1999b lóczy et al 2019 this in turn could lead to the varied occurrence of diversity and productivity within parts of the lake reese and batzer 2007 sartori et al 2015 alongside the occurrence of fish diversity and assemblages within sublocations of the same lake nyanti et

oxbow lakes brooker et al 2013 rechulicz et al 2015 the lateral connectivity of oxbows with the parent river channel vis a vis differing integrity and site specific habitat conditions for the sustenance of aquatic biota have been documented glińska lewczuk 2009 obolewski et al 2009 we hypothesize that the relationship between connectivity and water quality could impact the assemblage of fish communities within sublocations of complex shaped oxbows like sashadanga also driven by the fact that the relationship between biotic and abiotic features of oxbow lakes and their hydrological connectivity with the main riverbed are still poorly recognized strzałek and koperski 2009 this study examined the relationships between the physical features of the sashadanga oxbow lake distance of different parts of the lake from its source river riparian density to its chemical surface water quality and biological characteristics fish diversity materials and methods description of study area the present study covered the sashadanga oxbow lake its parent river channel ichamati river and its active flood plain covering approximately 42 500 ha situated between 22094 07 50 n and 88085 77 44 e to 88088 06 53 e fig 1 bhattacharjya et al 2017 sarkar et al 2020 the average depth of the lake ranges between 0 5 and 2 35 m while the surrounding temperature ranges between 40 and 42 c in summer and 9 12 c in winter the average rainfall ranges between 1170 and 1225 mm the total length of the lake is 6 4 km and the water area is 61 ha there are three distinct annual seasons in this region pre monsoon or dry season march to june monsoon or rainy season july to october and post monsoon or winter season november to february this oxbow lake is of high socioeconomic importance to the livelihood of the native people the principal source of pollution of the lake is municipal sewage and agricultural run off coming from the surrounding agricultural fields other anthropogenic activities around the lake include washing clothes bathing and solid waste disposal by local people which contribute to the deterioration of lake water quality the details of the study sites are summarized as follows s1 located on the proximal tip of the minor oxbow limb this part of the oxbow is situated close to intermittent incidences of bathing washing etc numerous types of aquatic flora vegetate around the sampling spot and mild algal bloom was found within the area s2 located on the distal part of the minor oxbow limb greater frequency of human activities like washing of clothes bathing and other domestic washing activities and solid waste disposal was observed at this part of the oxbow s3 located at the distal part of the major oxbow limb a slight presence of algal bloom was observed alongside the presence of submerged aquatic flora some floating aquatic floral diversity was observed in this sampling area isolated agricultural activities were evident within a 50 m radius of this area s4 located at the proximal tip of the major oxbow limb it is located upstream on the opposite side of station 1 there are different types of submerged aquatic flora in the sampling spot there was a presence of marked agricultural activity within this area it is also proximal to the most urbanized section of the ichamati river thus vulnerable to urban runoff land use and land cover assessment of oxbow floodplain analysis of land use and land cover of the ichamati flood plain was achieved using high resolution google earth images subjected to unsupervised classification analysis in arcgis

detecting and grouping pixels with common characteristics without a prior classification by the user hasmadi et al 2009 samples collection and analysis water samples were collected every first week of each month across seasons between 5 30 a m and 8 00 a m fish samples n 1440 were captured with the help of local fishermen at the four selected sampling stations all the fish species were conserved in

fish sampling was done from three nettings at each selected sampling station the total number of individuals in a sample and the total number of individuals in a species sampled in pre monsoon monsoon

morphological characteristics and topographical location of the oxbow lake a rough estimate of its relative position connectivity and altitudinal location compared to its originating river channel i e ichamati river was described visualized and determined from google earth satellite images the shortest distance of each sampling site of the lake to the parent channel was determined and utilized as the first measure of floodplain connectivity amoros and bornette 2002 obolewski et al 2014a the density of riparian buffer around each sublocation of the lake was used as a second measure of floodplain connectivity for the oxbow because the density of riparian vegetation forms point structures that can obstruct divert or facilitate water flow and so they are likely to control hydraulic connectivity in riparian zones on a large scale tabacchi et al 2000 to estimate and visualize vegetation cover riparian vegetation within the vicinity or buffer zone of the oxbow lake the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was determined using arcgis version 10 4 owokotomo et al 2020 using buffer analysis function in spatial analyst tools of arcmap the riparian density within a 200 m radius of each sampling area was further determined from this vegetation index to establish the relationship between surface water quality and riparian cover at each sampling station chukwuka and ogbeide 2021 statistical analysis to assign the sampling stations into homogeneous groups based on surface water quality and fish diversity at each station all the data were subjected to principal component analysis pca varimax rotation after ruling out highly correlated variables abdi and williams 2010 discriminant function analysis dfa was used to distinguish sites sublocations of the oxbow lake using physicochemical parameters the discriminant analysis uses linear combinations of the physicochemical parameters measured across sublocations of the oxbow to build a predictive model that differentiates the sites being compared poulsen and french 2008 to assess and visualize the difference in water quality across sublocations water quality comprehensive pollution index cpi was depicted using radar plots matta et al 2020 while all water quality variables were reported as mean and standard deviations for each site and across seasons all analysis was done with the aid of r studio

from this relative position oxbow classification based on disconnected reaches depicts the sashadanga lake as an oxbow located within an active floodplain hydrological measures of connectivity distance of sites from the parent channel measuring the shortest distance of the oxbow sites from the parent channel gave the following distances site 1 911 m site 2 758 m site 3 896 76 m site 4 191 m in other words site 1 which is the farthest oxbow site from the river channel has the least connectivity with the parent channel while site 4 is the closest oxbow area to the river channel has the strongest connectivity to the parent channel riparian vegetation results from the unsupervised classification output map showing landuse and landcover around the oxbow lake fig 2 a visualized in bar charts depict that the predominant land use of the oxbow lake area is mainly agricultural 25 98 with the sparse presence of riparian areas 26 12 as landcover fig 2b the depiction of predominant agricultural activity around the lake is confirmed by the buffer analysis and ndvi with predominant values 0 04 within 200 m of the vicinity of the oxbow fig 2c physicochemical condition from table 1 the physicochemical parameters of the different sites were assessed across seasons site 1 showed significantly higher trends of ph compared to other sites within seasons ph increased significantly at site 1 during the monsoon and post monsoon while at site 2 ph decreased significantly from monsoon to post monsoon at site 3 ph was relatively unchanged across seasons while at site 4 ph was significantly lower in the monsoon the temperature at all stations showed similar trends across seasons with the highest mean temperatures in the pre monsoon and lowest temperatures at the post monsoon conductivity within the oxbow areas showed significantly highest trends at site 3 during the pre monsoon and monsoon seasons while site 2 and site 4 showed significantly lower levels during the post monsoon period site 1 and 2 showed markedly lower turbidity across in pre monsoon while site 4 showed markedly higher turbidity in the monsoon and post monsoon season the highest concentrations of dissolved oxygen across seasons were detected in the oxbow area s surface water at sites 1 and 2 with significantly lower levels at sites 3 and 4 significantly lower levels of total solids across seasons were recorded at site 1 compared to sites 2 3 and 4 similarly free co2 across seasons was also lowest at site 1 compared to sites 2 3 and 4 compared to other sites site 1 showed markedly higher alkalinity of surface water during the pre monsoon season total hardness was also lowest at site 1 with the least levels during the post monsoon season calcium hardness showed a general increase in surface water across sites from pre monsoon to post monsoon season the level was generally higher at site 2 magnesium hardness was significantly lower across seasons at site 4 compared to sites 1 2 3 chloride concentration in surface water was markedly higher at site 1 during the pre monsoon phosphate levels within the surface water of the oxbow were higher at site 2 during the pre monsoon and higher at site 1 during the post monsoon total inorganic nitrogen was lowest across stations during the pre monsoon season increasing during the monsoon and post monsoon season the highest levels of total inorganic nitrogen were recorded for sites 3 and 4 during the post monsoon season the higher nutrient and turbid conditions of surface water at all the stations compared to station 1 which is farthest from the river may be associated with the distance of the oxbow sites from the parent river channel this channel proximity factor strongly determines the movement of materials from the channel into the oxbow area and thus sites of the oxbow mirror the quality of the areas of the river it is closest to discriminant function analysis dfa the physicochemical parameters of the sites or sublocations of the sashadanga oxbow lake were subjected to discriminant analysis to determine the degree of similarity between sites outcomes revealed 100 dissimilarity between the sites standardised coefficients of the variables revealed that the most significant contributing variables to the discrimination of the sites included temperature 3 80 turbidity 2 18 chlorine 1 51 mg 3 80 inorganic nitrogen 3 66 and total alkalinity 3 12 supplementary material i from the df1 axis of the discriminant plot site 4 was distinguished from the other sites based on a higher temperature turbidity and cl also from df1 axis sites 1 2 and 3 showed marked levels of mg inorganic nitrogen and total alkalinity fig 3 however the concentration of these parameters showed a gradient where site 1 site 2 site 3 pollution index assessment the cpi was calculated at all sampling sites across seasons and it was found to be in the range of 0 7 to 0 9 for station 1 1 0 1 2 for station 2 1 0 1 1 for station 3 and 1 1 1 3 for station 4 fig 4 considering the criteria of cpi 0 80 is an indication of good quality of river water concentrations accord with the standard station 1 was considered slightly polluted on this basis while other sites with cpi of 1 01 2 00 were considered moderately polluted fig 4 for most of the sites cpi was increased from pre to post monsoon ichthyofaunal composition and biotic indices fish faunal assessment across sites of the oxbow lake revealed 10 different orders with each order represented at all stations however with different relative occurrence to each other across seasons assessing the relative abundance for topmost species at each oxbow site is given in fig 5 o site 1 pre monsoon cypriniformes 39 6 siluriformes 12 1 monsoon cypriniformes 38 3 perciformes 10 6 post monsoon cypriniformes 36 98 siluriformes 13 13 o site 2 pre monsoon cypriniformes 38 9 siluriformes 12 96 monsoon cypriniformes 39 59 perciformes 12 14

perciformes 13 25 o site 4 pre monsoon cypriniformes 40 29 siluriformes 13 47 monsoon cypriniformes 40 39 perciformes 12 55 and post monsoon cypriniformes 34 9 perciformes 13 78 using the hill index asymptote to depict diversity indices across sites and seasons the none intersection of the three curves asymptotes indicates that the diversity represented by each curve significantly differed across seasons fig 6 further assessment of the curve asymptote showed site specific trends in the gradient slope steepness of the diversity curve across seasons at the distal sites site 1 and site 2 the curve gradient increased steeply during the monsoon followed by the pre monsoon and least steeply in the post monsoon this indicates that fish diversity was highest during the monsoon followed by the pre monsoon and least diversity during the post monsoon at for site 3 the gradient of the diversity curve was steepest during the post monsoon followed by the monsoon and least steeply in the pre monsoon while for site 4 the diversity curve was steepest during the pre monsoon followed by the monsoon and least steeply in the post monsoon in general the gentle slope of the diversity curve at post monsoon site 1 2 4 and pre monsoon site 3 indicates a lower diversity i e fewer number of species multivariate analysis fish community vs physical chemical variables the ordination diagram of pca summarizes the water quality parameters and station specific trends in relation to changes in seasons from pc 1 site 1 was associated with high temperature alkalinity mg ph and conductivity during the pre monsoon period while site 4 showed a more polluted state in the post monsoon being associated with high levels of total solids turbidity inorganic nitrogen ca and total hardness fig 7 a from pc 2 site 2 showed a positive association with total hardness total alkalinity and free co2 in both pre monsoon and post monsoon from pc 3 site 1 showed associations with ca do and total alkalinity in the post monsoon indicating that it was less polluted in this season compared to the pre monsoon fig 7b the association of site 2 with parameters of site 1 in this season indicates that site 1 and site 2 had similar water quality situations in the post monsoon season also evident from the pc 3 axis is the association of site 3 with total hardness total solids free co2 conductivity cl and temperature in both monsoon and pre monsoon season this association between monsoon and pre monsoon for site 3 indicates that the pollution events at that site are not modulated by seasonal effects but by the intensity of anthropogenic activity at that site from pc 4 site 2 and site 3 showed similar associations with high levels of mg and po4 during the post monsoon season indicating that season effects on water quality at both sites were similar in the post monsoon season for ichthyofaunal relationship with physicochemical properties from pc1 it is evident that irrespective of seasons site 1 was positively associated with the greatest abundance of species while site 4 was associated with the least number of species fig 7c site 2 and 3 indicate intermediate levels of fish abundance from pc 2 the season is the prominent factor and monsoon and post monsoon show a similar positive association with a greater number of species compared to the pre monsoon which was positively associated with fewer species abundance discussion the elevation of the sashadanga oxbow lake relative to the ichamati river highlights this river as its parent channel from this relative position oxbow classification based on disconnected reaches depicts the sashadanga lake as an oxbow located within an active floodplain molnar 2011 oxbow lakes are characteristically located within the context of a parent channel which affects its ecology habitat quality and occurrence of fauna and flora of various species particularly when it is within the active floodplain of the parent channel obolewski 2011 stella et al 2011 more so the ecosystem services derivable from floodplain wetlands are significantly influenced by their position in the landscape schwarz et al 1996 güntzel et al 2010 the relative distance of each site of the oxbow from the parent channel indicates the degree of connectivity with the parent channel and the greater likelihood of receiving matter from the parent channel during flood high water periods as such site 1 which is the farthest oxbow site from the river channel has the least connectivity with the parent channel while site 4 is the closest oxbow area to the river channel has the strongest connectivity to the parent channel although the amplitude of the water level fluctuations in the riverbed affects the hydrological connectivity of aquatic ecosystems within the floodplain the distance from the lake to the river is a strong determinant of its hydrological connectivity obolewski et al 2014a furthermore the combination of distance from the parent channel and morphology of the oxbow leads to the emergence of large mosaics of ecosystems water and land with a strong gradient of biodiversity within the floodplain amoros and bornette 2002 arscott et al 2005 these variables are strong determinants of water mineral and organic matter exchange between the parent fluvial systems and the floodplain lakes obolewski et al 2014a riparian buffers are also critical for watershed connectivity because of their role in intercepting cascades of water flowing from drainage basins and floodplains into adjacent water bodies malanson 1993 from this study the low ndvi values for the 200 m buffer area of the sashadanga oxbow indicates a largely depleted riparian vegetation area elsewhere occurence of agriculture as a predominant feature in landuse landcover classifications is strongly indicative of wetland degradation tockner et al 2010 most importantly the depleted riparian area implies increased vulnerability of the oxbow to flood and contaminant laden runoff from sections of the parent channel located within urbanized landscapes riparian buffer zones can present benefits to control the transport of diffuse organic pollutants including pesticide transport into the aquatic systems thus are beneficial in reducing soil erosion and improving the water quality of floodplain lakes syversen 2002 grismer et al 2006 the higher ph values for the farthest oxbow site i e site 1 during the monsoon and post monsoon compared to decreased values at sites 2 and 4 during the same period and relatively unchanged values for site 3 across the season strongly indicates the existence of site specific trends across sites although most natural aquatic systems are generally alkaline due to the presence of sufficient quantities of carbonate trivedy and goel 1984 changes in ph could occur in response to seasonal transitions and biological activity gupta and devi 2014 however the high ph observed at the farthest oxbow site during monsoon season may be due to the influence of freshwater influx dilution of the floodplain low temperature and organic matter decomposition singh and jayakumar 2016 the significantly higher conductivity values at sites proximal to the channel i e site 3 during the pre monsoon and monsoon seasons while site 2 and site 4 showed significantly lower levels during the post monsoon period also reflects site and season specific anthropogenic activities within the different sub locations of the sashadanga oxbow although electrical conductivity of floodplain habitats have been attributed to inorganic suspensions from turbid floodwaters differential settling rates during and after a flood can also contribute to conductivity gradients within an oxbow lake akhurst and breen 1988 similarly the markedly lower turbidity at distal sites site 1 and 2 compared to the more proximal sites sites 3 and 4 also implicates nearness to parent channel and other local anthropogenic activities surface water within the lower gangetic plain of west bengal is moderately polluted due to surface run offs and domestic wastes during the monsoon and pre monsoon months ganesan and khan 2008 the considerable inflow of nutrients to those ecosystems is usually followed by an intensive growth of phytoplankton which could also cause a decrease in water transparency mandaville 2002 the importance of lake morphology flushing and conductivity as determinants of turbidity and light attenuation in the floodplain lakes has also been documented akhurst and breen 1988 in addition the largely disrupted riparian features of the shashadanga oxbow as depicted by the ndvi analysis ensure that runoff from agricultural fields travel unfiltered and impact the surface quality of the lake the highest concentrations of dissolved oxygen across seasons were detected in the oxbow area s surface water at sites 1 and 2 with significantly lower levels at sites 3 and 4 can be explained by oxygen deficits due to the presence and proliferation of emergent and floating vegetation limited aeration of surface water and high bod particularly during the summer van den brink et al 1992 chimney and pietro 2006 during seasons of intense hydrological activity i e monsoon and post monsoon periods water transport accelerated within the catchment feeding oxbows lakes with river water and floods from surrounding watersheds mitsch and day 2006 however depending on the quality of the river channel the passage of floodwater through the oxbow lakes could deposit substances that transform the receiving part of the lake chemically and significantly impair its dissolved oxygen levels tockner et al 1999 owokotomo et al 2020 as such the proximity of sites 3 and 4 to the river channel may have increased its vulnerability to flooding substances that negatively impacted the levels of dissolved oxygen in those areas of the oxbow the significantly lower levels of total solids across seasons were recorded at site 1 compared to sites 2 3 and 4 could also be attributed to the relative connectivity of the different sites compared to site 1 when compared to disconnected lakes the greater amount of dissolved solids in lotic and semi lotic oxbow lakes of floodplain habitats is a direct reflection of fluvial overflow glińska lewczuk 2009 as such the high tds could be taken as a reflection of the greater proximity and connectivity of sites 2 3 and 4 compared to site 1 since free high co2 is largely a reflection of fossil fuel usage the higher levels recorded at sites 2 3 and 4 compared to site 1 implicates local anthropogenic activities at each sublocation of the oxbow in the trends of surface water quality recorded during the study adeogun et al 2012 on the other hand since flood pulses can cause a degassing of co2 from water bianchi et al 2013 the greater connectivity of the oxbow sites 2 3 4 may explain the significantly higher co2 compared to other sites of the oxbow site 1 showed markedly higher alkalinity of surface water during the pre monsoon season the higher alkalinity in the low flood periods could be linked to low water levels within the oxbow and the resultant concentration of salts within the floodplain ufodike et al 2001 since site 1 is farthest from the parent channel its likelihood of inundation will be the least compared to the other oxbow sites during the low flood season chloride concentration in surface water was markedly higher at site 1 during the pre monsoon the variation in water hardness ions and chloride concentrations within the oxbow could also be attributed to low water levels and the resultant concentration of ions during the low flood periods and vice versa koloanda and oladimeji 2004 although the higher mean value of phosphate phosphorus po4 p in the pre monsoon could be linked to concentration effect owing to lower water levels in the oxbow the observation at site 2 indicate site specific augmentation of phosphate levels through the localized introduction of human and animal waste and laundry activities owokotomo et al 2020 the site specific elevated levels of inorganic nitrogen emphasize the role of oxbow physical features and morphology to cause site selective retention of external dissolved substances during and immediately after flood periods johnston et al 1984 the asymmetric features of most oxbows also affect distributions of water quality within their surface area lesack et al 1998 van der peijl and verhoeven 2000 the higher nutrient and turbid conditions of surface water at all the stations compared to station 1 which is farthest from the river may be associated with the distance of the oxbow sites from the parent river channel this channel proximity factor strongly determines the movement of materials from the channel into the oxbow area and thus sites of the oxbow mirror the quality of the areas of the river it is closest to this has been demonstrated in studies that linked turbid and meso eutrophic conditions in oxbows to connectivity with turbid rivers reid and ogden 2009 grundell et al 2012 this is because lotic oxbows are particularly open to the exchange of matter with the river causing higher concentrations of macro elements however the relative connectivity of different parts of the oxbow to the river channel may be directly affecting the environmental parameters i e nutrients phosphorus and nitrogen concentration mineral levels temperature ph and water transparency at each oxbow site van den brink 1994 in essence the proximity of oxbows areas to channels increases connectivity and the accessibility of allochthonous matter and aquatic organisms into lentic oxbow lakes tockner et al 1999 amoros and bornette 2002 discriminant analysis depicting 100 dissimilarity between the sites highlighted temperature 3 80 turbidity 2 18 chlorine 1 51 mg 3 80 inorganic nitrogen 3 66 and total alkalinity 3 12 as the priority variables differentiating the oxbow sites the most supplementary material i the marked levels of mg inorganic nitrogen and total alkalinity at sites 1 2 3 as gradient where site 1 site 2 site 3 is attributable to site specific hydrological conditions owing to lake morphology gallardo et al 2008 glińska lewczuk and burandt 2011 the high gradients of temperature which appeared to be a priority variable in distinguishing the sublocations of the lake i e from site 4 down to site 1 bring to bear the vertical profiles of the oxbow lake and its possible role in the active exchange of ground and surface water the share of riverine and groundwater water sources in supplying oxbow lakes rises and falls on the periodicity of flood pulses when floods abate water is slowly released back to the river galat et al 1998 after which groundwater discharge the oxbow lake dominates over the riverine and transforms properties of water in the lake as such the higher temperature of site 4 may be attributed to the slope being steep enough to drain groundwater out from the aquifer and release it downstream amoros 2001 the increase in cpi value might be due to the increased inflow of pollutants of organic pollutants from the section of the parent channel closest to the oxbow area the hydrological conditions of oxbow lakes directly contribute to chemical and physical modulations with direct effects on the biotic activities and distribution gosselink and turner 1978 depending on the quality of the river channel the periodic flooding of the river during monsoon and post monsoon could impact physical and chemical changes within its floodplain that affect the community structure of local flora and fauna arrington and winemiller 2006 tedesco et al 2008 depictions from this relative abundance of fish species within the lake revealed that cypriniformes was the most abundant in the lake irrespective of site and season this finding may be attributable to oxbow type habitats being preferred by members of cypriniformes reports from three different oxbow lakes in malaysia also demonstrated the dominance of cyprinidae families 45 80 dominating the lakes heng et al 2006 investigations into factors that influence the variation of cyprinid abundances across habitats highlighted habitat type as the most important variable particularly pool type habitats and sustained flooded habitats janáč et al 2010 tesfay et al 2019 this was confirmed from other studies which reported that the abundance of this taxon varied inversely with habitat width and directly with ambient oxygen and alkalinity beamish et al 2006 the abundance of siluriformes as the next most abundant taxa after cypriniformes in the pre monsoon across stations of the oxbow area may also be attributable to habitat type preferences studies testing the hypothesis that fishes differ in habitat preference based on hydraulic characteristics and substrate type demonstrated that members of the siluriformes have a preference for shallow slow flowing habitats with the mud sand substrate costa et al 2013 this may also explain why their abundance is greater in the pre monsoon before the onset of rains perciformes across sites in the oxbow area were the second highest contributors to species diversity during the monsoon and post monsoon this may be attributed to a general preference of perciformes taxa for flowing and deeper water habitat features available during the monsoon rains huang et al 2019 oxbows connected with their parent channel only during high flood periods i e plesiopotamic lakes are notable as environments that support early life stages of many freshwater species grift et al 2003 penczak 2003 particularly for phyto philic species balon 1975 the higher incidence of perciformes during the high flood seasons i e monsoon and post monsoon strongly implicates the increased interconnectivity between the oxbow and the river channel during this season studies on floodplain dynamics hold that the varied constituents of local fish communities align predictably with the hydrological season pekcan hekim 2007 this is plausible because the seasonal flooding and connectivity of oxbows regulate the niche availability i e trophic preferences and spawning patches for several species galacatos et al 2004 neves dos santos et al 2008 the fewer number of species at different areas of the lake at different seasons could be a reflection of the relative carrying capacity of habitat patches within the oxbow lake the modulated chemical and physical features of oxbows due to flood events have direct implications on the activities and distribution of floodplain biota gosselink and turner 1978 tockner et al 2010 from junk s theory it is inferred that the flood pulse is a critical determinant of the productivity of lake river systems and by extension occurrence of species and biodiversity junk 1997 the abundance of fewer species at certain areas of the oxbow lake at certain seasons highlights the succession events and activities of opportunistic species characteristic of oxbow areas the marked alternate hydrological events of oxbow areas favour natural succession allowing adaptive and opportunistic species to coexist amoros and bornette 1999b this feature of frequent succession in oxbow terrains also gives credence to reports that flood pulse experienced by oxbows could make it vulnerable to invasive species of various taxa including fish lóczy et al 2019 the dynamics of changing dominance of species across seasons may be explained on the basis that before flooding seasons scarce resources intensifies niche overlap and a resultant selective survival of species mérona and rankin de mérona 2004 the hills diversity curve asymptote highlighted the significantly different playout of diversity across seasons in addition to the distance of different sites from the parent channel the periodic connectivity portends different risks to the biota of the oxbow lake the periodic flooding and fluctuations in the water level aspetsberger et al 2002 could cause marked gradients in habitat conditions across different parts of the lake amoros and bornette 1999b lóczy et al 2019 resulting in the varied occurrence of diversity and productivity within parts of the lake reese and batzer 2007 sartori et al 2015 fish diversity inclusive nyanti et al 2018 kleinhappel et al 2019 recent studies have highlighted the importance of hydrological connectivity as a key factor influencing the qualitative and quantitative structure of species distribution in oxbow lakes of lowland rivers jakubik 2012 obolewski and gliñska lewczuk 2013 in particular the hydrological connectivity for water mediated transfer of energy sediment and organic matter and organisms within or amongst elements of riverine corridors cabezas et al 2009 gallardo et al 2012 could also function for transport of chemical substances or pollutants in quantities that negatively impact the biodiversity of ecosystems obolewski et al 2009 for instance an increased supply of nutrients into a floodplain lake from its parent could result in massive development of phytoplankton and an inadvertent elimination of stenotopic organisms the significantly higher concentration of dissolved elements in surface water of oxbow areas is reflective of connectivity and resultant inflow of matter and contribution from parent channel compared to disconnected ones glińska lewczuk 2009 the degree of connectivity of a lake with its parent channel determines pathways of nutrient transport resulting in uneven distributions of matter within sites of floodplain oxbows amoros 2001 reduced hydrological connectivity of oxbows with the parent channel during the low flood season has been implicated in lower species diversity and could be attributable to fewer trophic options or spawning patches mérona and rankin de mérona 2004 however the ability of the deltaic lowland area of station 1 to sustain greater species diversity may be attributed to its terrain features within the oxbow area that allows it to trap the excess monsoonal water alongside planktonic resources during the rainy season thus increasing its chances of sustaining a greater number of species in addition the occurrence of species across seasons may be related at least in part to the seasonal variation in water transparency the high relative occurrence of silurifomes taxa a non visually oriented carnivorous species ohara et al 2016 during the pre monsoon or pre flooding period when transparency was higher across sites in the lake exemplifies the role of transparency in shaping trends in species occurence in essence the lower number of fish individuals at the oxbow sites proximal to the parent channel of the oxbow implicates the deteriorated quality of the parent channel and probable local anthropogenic activities furthermore the altered fish diversity in oxbow environments due to connectivity to channels with poor water quality has been reported gell et al 2009 reid and ogden 2009 highlights the fact that connectivity to polluted fluvial sources can alter not only the physical and chemical quality of oxbows but can also modify the biotic components and reduce habitat support for a wider range of species conclusion depending on the distance of oxbow areas to the parent channel and vegetation buffer density as a cofactor periodic floods across seasons affect hydrological connectivity for different parts of the oxbow in a way that affects the physicochemical characteristics this in turn will affect the composition and abundance of fish communities at different points of the lake in essence the incidence of high turbidity and nutrient rich characteristics of stations proximal to the parent channel undoubtedly implicates the quality of surface water flowing into the lake during periodic floods from the parent channel we recommend extensive assessment of floodplain lakes for insight into the dynamics of floodplain connectivity to help identify sites of the oxbow area most sensitive to inputs from impacted watersheds thus aiding decisions in protecting and conserving the rich

20054,ecological processes and distribution of biodiversity within river floodplains are driven by the hydrological regime of the area the relationship between fish abundance diversity and surface water quality at four impact points of the sashadanga oxbow lake was examined based on hydrological connectivity distance of lake sections from parent channel density of buffer vegetation and hydrological phases of seasons fish sample populations n 1440 belonging to 10 orders showed greater numerical abundance in the pre and post flooding phases oxbow sites proximal to the parent channel showed higher comprehensive pollution index cpi higher dominance and lower species evenness during the pre monsoon minor flooding and vice versa during the monsoon and post monsoon greater flooding periods diversity descriptors using curve asymptote based on hill s numbers indicate significant site specific fish diversity within the oxbow lake at different seasons discriminant analysis revealed that change in temperature turbidity and concentration of inorganic nitrogen were significant predictors in differentiating the quality of the different sites of the lake principal component analysis pca revealed that the relative abundance of each species order across sites was significantly influenced by changes in seasons and physicochemical parameters and showed a weak association with the density of buffer vegetation at sites depending on the distance of oxbow areas to the parent channel the combination of periodic flooding riparian buffer and lake morphology define the degree of

are spatially and temporally heterogeneous ecosystems characterized by highly diverse biota adapted to their terrain tockner and stanford 2002 ogbeide et al 2019 its connectivity within riverine landscapes also affects the degree to which species movement across patches of resources is facilitated or impeded ward 1997 tischendorf and fahrig 2000 oxbow lakes are ecological hotspots within river floodplains with diverse biota comparable to rain forests and coral reefs ward et al 2002 however oxbow watersheds are surrounded by intense agricultural activity i e large scale intensive arable farming and a marked loss of vegetation buffer areas lóczy et al 2019 this depleted density of riparian buffer vegetation affects its role as watershed aquatic interfaces and ability to regulate hydrological disturbance hydric stress and nutrient or sediment inputs from the floodplain hough snee 2016 garner et al 2017 as a result varied chemistry of oxbows due to nutrient laden runoff from adjacent cultivated lands with risks of eutrophication and phytoplankton blooms and the declining biodiversity due to poor surface water quality constitutes a major concern for lentic oxbow lakes ciazela et al 2018 in the event of these trends bioindicator metrics based on the diversity abundance and distribution of aquatic species have been used as sentinels of environmental quality mandaville 2002 arscott et al 2005 in particular spatial assessment of species diversity using curve based index e g hill s diversity index as an unbiased reflection of relative diversity has been documented gotelli and chao 2013 kondratyeva et al 2019 although the interdependence between river channels and floodplain lakes is determined by periodical flooding and fluctuations in the water level aspetsberger et al 2002 the morphology of oxbows is also a determinant factor in the exchange of matter obolewski et al 2016 periodic hydrological events and temporary connectivity formed during flood seasons could cause marked gradients in habitat conditions across different parts of the lake amoros and bornette 1999b lóczy et al 2019 this in turn could lead to the varied occurrence of diversity and productivity within parts of the lake reese and batzer 2007 sartori et al 2015 alongside the occurrence of fish diversity and assemblages within sublocations of the same lake nyanti et

connectivity obolewski et al 2014b specific trophic relationships and substratum type are also co determinant factors in the species distribution and composition of fish communities sub locations of oxbow lakes brooker et al 2013 rechulicz et al 2015 the lateral connectivity of oxbows with the parent river channel vis a vis differing integrity and site specific habitat conditions for the sustenance of aquatic biota have been documented glińska lewczuk 2009 obolewski et al 2009 we hypothesize that the relationship between connectivity and water quality could impact the assemblage of fish communities within sublocations of complex shaped oxbows like sashadanga also driven by the fact that the relationship between biotic and abiotic features of oxbow lakes and their hydrological connectivity with the main riverbed are still poorly recognized strzałek and koperski 2009 this study examined the relationships between the physical features of the sashadanga oxbow lake distance of different parts of the lake from its source river riparian density to its chemical surface water quality and biological characteristics fish diversity materials and methods description of study area the present study covered the sashadanga oxbow lake its parent river channel ichamati river and its active flood plain covering approximately 42 500 ha situated between 22094 07 50 n and 88085 77 44 e to 88088 06 53 e fig 1 bhattacharjya et al 2017 sarkar et al 2020 the average depth of the lake ranges between 0 5 and 2 35 m while the surrounding temperature ranges between 40 and 42 c in summer and 9 12 c in winter the average rainfall ranges between 1170 and 1225 mm the total length of the lake is 6 4 km and the water area is 61 ha there are three distinct annual seasons in this region pre monsoon or dry season march to june monsoon or rainy season july to october and post monsoon or winter season november to february this oxbow lake is of high socioeconomic importance to the livelihood of the native people the principal source of pollution of the lake is municipal sewage and agricultural run off coming from the surrounding agricultural fields other anthropogenic activities around the lake include washing clothes bathing and solid waste disposal by local people which contribute to the deterioration of lake water quality the details of the study sites are summarized as follows s1 located on the proximal tip of the minor oxbow limb this part of the oxbow is situated close to intermittent incidences of bathing washing etc numerous types of aquatic flora vegetate around the sampling spot and mild algal bloom was found within the area s2 located on the distal part of the minor oxbow limb greater frequency of human activities like washing of clothes bathing and other domestic washing activities and solid waste disposal was observed at this part of the oxbow s3 located at the distal part of the major oxbow limb a slight presence of algal bloom was observed alongside the presence of submerged aquatic flora some floating aquatic floral diversity was observed in this sampling area isolated agricultural activities were evident within a 50 m radius of this area s4 located at the proximal tip of the major oxbow limb it is located upstream on the opposite side of station 1 there are different types of submerged aquatic flora in the sampling spot there was a presence of marked agricultural activity within this area it is also proximal to the most urbanized section of the ichamati river thus vulnerable to urban runoff land use and land cover assessment of oxbow floodplain analysis of land use and land cover of the ichamati flood plain was achieved using high resolution google earth images subjected to unsupervised classification analysis in arcgis

detecting and grouping pixels with common characteristics without a prior classification by the user hasmadi et al 2009 samples collection and analysis water samples were collected every first week of each month across seasons between 5 30 a m and 8 00 a m fish samples n 1440 were captured with the help of local fishermen at the four selected sampling stations all the fish species were conserved in

morphological characteristics and topographical location of the oxbow lake a rough estimate of its relative position connectivity and altitudinal location compared to its originating river channel i e ichamati river was described visualized and determined from google earth satellite images the shortest distance of each sampling site of the lake to the parent channel was determined and utilized as the first measure of floodplain connectivity amoros and bornette 2002 obolewski et al 2014a the density of riparian buffer around each sublocation of the lake was used as a second measure of floodplain connectivity for the oxbow because the density of riparian vegetation forms point structures that can obstruct divert or facilitate water flow and so they are likely to control hydraulic connectivity in riparian zones on a large scale tabacchi et al 2000 to estimate and visualize vegetation cover riparian vegetation within the vicinity or buffer zone of the oxbow lake the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was determined using arcgis version 10 4 owokotomo et al 2020 using buffer analysis function in spatial analyst tools of arcmap the riparian density within a 200 m radius of each sampling area was further determined from this vegetation index to establish the relationship between surface water quality and riparian cover at each sampling station chukwuka and ogbeide 2021 statistical analysis to assign the sampling stations into homogeneous groups based on surface water quality and fish diversity at each station all the data were subjected to principal component analysis pca varimax rotation after ruling out highly correlated variables abdi and williams 2010 discriminant function analysis dfa was used to distinguish sites sublocations of the oxbow lake using physicochemical parameters the discriminant analysis uses linear combinations of the physicochemical parameters measured across sublocations of the oxbow to build a predictive model that differentiates the sites being compared poulsen and french 2008 to assess and visualize the difference in water quality across sublocations water quality comprehensive pollution index cpi was depicted using radar plots matta et al 2020 while all water quality variables were reported as mean and standard deviations for each site and across seasons all analysis was done with the aid of r studio originlab 2019 and statistica version 12 results general description of floodplain the elevation of the sashadanga oxbow lake relative to the ichamati river highlights this river as its parent channel from this relative position oxbow classification based on disconnected reaches depicts the sashadanga lake as an oxbow located within an active floodplain hydrological measures of connectivity distance of sites from the parent channel measuring the shortest distance of the oxbow sites from the parent channel gave the following distances site 1 911 m site 2 758 m site 3 896 76 m site 4 191 m in other words site 1 which is the farthest oxbow site from the river channel has the least connectivity with the parent channel while site 4 is the closest oxbow area to the river channel has the strongest connectivity to the parent channel riparian vegetation results from the unsupervised classification output map showing landuse and landcover around the oxbow lake fig 2 a visualized in bar charts depict that the predominant land use of the oxbow lake area is mainly agricultural 25 98 with the sparse presence of riparian areas 26 12 as landcover fig 2b the depiction of predominant agricultural activity around the lake is confirmed by the buffer analysis and ndvi with predominant values 0 04 within 200 m of the vicinity of the oxbow fig 2c physicochemical condition from table 1 the physicochemical parameters of the different sites were assessed across seasons site 1 showed significantly higher trends of ph compared to other sites within seasons ph increased significantly at site 1 during the monsoon and post monsoon while at site 2 ph decreased significantly from monsoon to post monsoon at site 3 ph was relatively unchanged across seasons while at site 4 ph was significantly lower in the monsoon the temperature at all stations showed similar trends across seasons with the highest mean temperatures in the pre monsoon and lowest temperatures at the post monsoon conductivity within the oxbow areas showed significantly highest trends at site 3 during the pre monsoon and monsoon seasons while site 2 and site 4 showed significantly lower levels during the post monsoon period site 1 and 2 showed markedly lower turbidity across in pre monsoon while site 4 showed markedly higher turbidity in the monsoon and post monsoon season the highest concentrations of dissolved oxygen across seasons were detected in the oxbow area s surface water at sites 1 and 2 with significantly lower levels at sites 3 and 4 significantly lower levels of total solids across seasons were recorded at site 1 compared to sites 2 3 and 4 similarly free co2 across seasons was also lowest at site 1 compared to sites 2 3 and 4 compared to other sites site 1 showed markedly higher alkalinity of surface water during the pre monsoon season total hardness was also lowest at site 1 with the least levels during the post monsoon season calcium hardness showed a general increase in surface water across sites from pre monsoon to post monsoon season the level was generally higher at site 2 magnesium hardness was significantly lower across seasons at site 4 compared to sites 1 2 3 chloride concentration in surface water was markedly higher at site 1 during the pre monsoon phosphate levels within the surface water of the oxbow were higher at site 2 during the pre monsoon and higher at site 1 during the post monsoon total inorganic nitrogen was lowest across stations during the pre monsoon season increasing during the monsoon and post monsoon season the highest levels of total inorganic nitrogen were recorded for sites 3 and 4 during the post monsoon season the higher nutrient and turbid conditions of surface water at all the stations compared to station 1 which is farthest from the river may be associated with the distance of the oxbow sites from the parent river channel this channel proximity factor strongly determines the movement of materials from the channel into the oxbow area and thus sites of the oxbow mirror the quality of the areas of the river it is closest to discriminant function analysis dfa the physicochemical parameters of the sites or sublocations of the sashadanga oxbow lake were subjected to discriminant analysis to determine the degree of similarity between sites outcomes revealed 100 dissimilarity between the sites standardised coefficients of the variables revealed that the most significant contributing variables to the discrimination of the sites included temperature 3 80 turbidity 2 18 chlorine 1 51 mg 3 80 inorganic nitrogen 3 66 and total alkalinity 3 12 supplementary material i from the df1 axis of the discriminant plot site 4 was distinguished from the other sites based on a higher temperature turbidity and cl also from df1 axis sites 1 2 and 3 showed marked levels of mg inorganic nitrogen and total alkalinity fig 3 however the concentration of these parameters showed a gradient where site 1 site 2 site 3 pollution index assessment the cpi was calculated at all sampling sites across seasons and it was found to be in the range of 0 7 to 0 9 for station 1 1 0 1 2 for station 2 1 0 1 1 for station 3 and 1 1 1 3 for station 4 fig 4 considering the criteria of cpi 0 80 is an indication of good quality of river water concentrations accord with the standard station 1 was considered slightly polluted on this basis while other sites with cpi of 1 01 2 00 were considered moderately polluted fig 4 for most of the sites cpi was increased from pre to post monsoon ichthyofaunal composition and biotic indices fish faunal assessment across sites of the oxbow lake revealed 10 different orders with each order represented at all stations however with different relative occurrence to each other across seasons assessing the relative abundance for topmost species at each oxbow site is given in fig 5 o site 1 pre monsoon cypriniformes 39 6 siluriformes 12 1

perciformes 13 25 o site 4 pre monsoon cypriniformes 40 29 siluriformes 13 47 monsoon cypriniformes 40 39 perciformes 12 55 and post monsoon cypriniformes 34 9 perciformes 13 78 using the hill index asymptote to depict diversity indices across sites and seasons the none intersection of the three curves asymptotes indicates that the diversity represented by each curve significantly differed across seasons fig 6 further assessment of the curve asymptote showed site specific trends in the gradient slope steepness of the diversity curve across seasons at the distal sites site 1 and site 2 the curve gradient increased steeply during the monsoon followed by the pre monsoon and least steeply in the post monsoon this indicates that fish diversity was highest during the monsoon followed by the pre monsoon and least diversity during the post monsoon at for site 3 the gradient of the diversity curve was steepest during the post monsoon followed by the monsoon and least steeply in the pre monsoon while for site 4 the diversity curve was steepest during the pre monsoon followed by the monsoon and least steeply in the post monsoon in general the gentle slope of the diversity curve at post monsoon site 1 2 4 and pre monsoon site 3 indicates a lower diversity i e fewer number of species multivariate analysis fish community vs physical chemical variables the ordination diagram of pca summarizes the water quality parameters and station specific trends in relation to changes in seasons from pc 1 site 1 was associated with high temperature alkalinity mg ph and conductivity during the pre monsoon period while site 4 showed a more polluted state in the post monsoon being associated with high levels of total solids turbidity inorganic nitrogen ca and total hardness fig 7 a from pc 2 site 2 showed a positive association with total hardness total alkalinity and free co2 in both pre monsoon and post monsoon from pc 3 site 1 showed associations with ca do and total alkalinity in the post monsoon indicating that it was less polluted in this season compared to the pre monsoon fig 7b the association of site 2 with parameters of site 1 in this season indicates that site 1 and site 2 had similar water quality situations in the post monsoon season also evident from the pc 3 axis is the association of site 3 with total hardness total solids free co2 conductivity cl and temperature in both monsoon and pre monsoon season this association between monsoon and pre monsoon for site 3 indicates that the pollution events at that site are not modulated by seasonal effects but by the intensity of anthropogenic activity at that site from pc 4 site 2 and site 3 showed similar associations with high levels of mg and po4 during the post monsoon season indicating that season effects on water quality at both sites were similar in the post monsoon season for ichthyofaunal relationship with physicochemical properties from pc1 it is evident that irrespective of seasons site 1 was positively associated with the greatest abundance of species while site 4 was associated with the least number of species fig 7c site 2 and 3 indicate intermediate levels of fish abundance from pc 2 the season is the prominent factor and monsoon and post monsoon show a similar positive association with a greater number of species compared to the pre monsoon which was positively associated with fewer species abundance discussion the elevation of the sashadanga oxbow lake relative to the ichamati river highlights this river as its parent channel from this relative position oxbow classification based on disconnected reaches depicts the sashadanga lake as an oxbow located within an active floodplain molnar 2011 oxbow lakes are characteristically located within the context of a parent channel which affects its ecology habitat quality and occurrence of fauna and flora of various species particularly when it is within the active floodplain of the parent channel obolewski 2011 stella et al 2011 more so the ecosystem services derivable from floodplain wetlands are significantly influenced by their position in the landscape schwarz et al 1996 güntzel et al 2010 the relative distance of each site of the oxbow from the parent channel indicates the degree of connectivity with the parent channel and the greater likelihood of receiving matter from the parent channel during flood high water periods as such site 1 which is the farthest oxbow site from the river channel has the least connectivity with the parent channel while site 4 is the closest oxbow area to the river channel has the strongest connectivity to the parent channel although the amplitude of the water level fluctuations in the riverbed affects the hydrological connectivity of aquatic ecosystems within the floodplain the distance from the lake to the river is a strong determinant of its hydrological connectivity obolewski et al 2014a furthermore the combination of distance from the parent channel and morphology of the oxbow leads to the emergence of large mosaics of ecosystems water and land with a strong gradient of biodiversity within the floodplain amoros and bornette 2002 arscott et al 2005 these variables are strong determinants of water mineral and organic matter exchange between the parent fluvial systems and the floodplain lakes obolewski et al 2014a riparian buffers are also critical for watershed connectivity because of their role in intercepting cascades of water flowing from drainage basins and floodplains into adjacent water bodies malanson 1993 from this study the low ndvi values for the 200 m buffer area of the sashadanga oxbow indicates a largely depleted riparian vegetation area elsewhere occurence of agriculture as a predominant feature in landuse landcover classifications is strongly indicative of wetland degradation tockner et al 2010 most importantly the depleted riparian area implies increased vulnerability of the oxbow to flood and contaminant laden runoff from sections of the parent channel located within urbanized landscapes riparian buffer zones can present benefits to control the transport of diffuse organic pollutants including pesticide transport into the aquatic systems thus are beneficial in reducing soil erosion and improving the water quality of floodplain lakes syversen 2002 grismer et al 2006 the higher ph values for the farthest oxbow site i e site 1 during the monsoon and post monsoon compared to decreased values at sites 2 and 4 during the same period and relatively unchanged values for site 3 across the season strongly indicates the existence of site specific trends across sites although most natural aquatic systems are generally alkaline due to the presence of sufficient quantities of carbonate trivedy and goel 1984 changes in ph could occur in response to seasonal transitions and biological activity gupta and devi 2014 however the high ph observed at the farthest oxbow site during monsoon season may be due to the influence of freshwater influx dilution of the floodplain low temperature and organic matter decomposition singh and jayakumar 2016 the significantly higher conductivity values at sites proximal to the channel i e site 3 during the pre monsoon and monsoon seasons while site 2 and site 4 showed significantly lower levels during the post monsoon period also reflects site and season specific anthropogenic activities within the different sub locations of the sashadanga oxbow although electrical conductivity of floodplain habitats have been attributed to inorganic suspensions from turbid floodwaters differential settling rates during and after a flood can also contribute to conductivity gradients within an oxbow lake akhurst and breen 1988 similarly the markedly lower turbidity at distal sites site 1 and 2 compared to the more proximal sites sites 3 and 4 also implicates nearness to parent channel and other local anthropogenic activities surface water within the lower gangetic plain of west bengal is moderately polluted due to surface run offs and domestic wastes during the monsoon and pre monsoon months ganesan and khan 2008 the considerable inflow of nutrients to those ecosystems is usually followed by an intensive growth of phytoplankton which could also cause a decrease in water transparency mandaville 2002 the importance of lake morphology flushing and conductivity as determinants of turbidity and light attenuation in the floodplain lakes has also been documented akhurst and breen 1988 in addition the largely disrupted riparian features of the shashadanga oxbow as depicted by the ndvi analysis ensure that runoff from agricultural fields travel unfiltered and impact the surface quality of the lake the highest concentrations of dissolved oxygen across seasons were detected in the oxbow area s surface water at sites 1 and 2 with significantly lower levels at sites 3 and 4 can be explained by oxygen deficits due to the presence and proliferation of emergent and floating vegetation limited aeration of surface water and high bod particularly during the summer van den brink et al 1992 chimney and pietro 2006 during seasons of intense hydrological activity i e monsoon and post monsoon periods water transport accelerated within the catchment feeding oxbows lakes with river water and floods from surrounding watersheds mitsch and day 2006 however depending on the quality of the river channel the passage of floodwater through the oxbow lakes could deposit substances that transform the receiving part of the lake chemically and significantly impair its dissolved oxygen levels tockner et al 1999 owokotomo et al 2020 as such the proximity of sites 3 and 4 to the river channel may have increased its vulnerability to flooding substances that negatively impacted the levels of dissolved oxygen in those areas of the oxbow the significantly lower levels of total solids across seasons were recorded at site 1 compared to sites 2 3 and 4 could also be attributed to the relative connectivity of the different sites compared to site 1 when compared to disconnected lakes the greater amount of dissolved solids in lotic and semi lotic oxbow lakes of floodplain habitats is a direct reflection of fluvial overflow glińska lewczuk 2009 as such the high tds could be taken as a reflection of the greater proximity and connectivity of sites 2 3 and 4 compared to site 1 since free high co2 is largely a reflection of fossil fuel usage the higher levels recorded at sites 2 3 and 4 compared to site 1 implicates local anthropogenic activities at each sublocation of the oxbow in the trends of surface water quality recorded during the study adeogun et al 2012 on the other hand since flood pulses can cause a degassing of co2 from water bianchi et al 2013 the greater connectivity of the oxbow sites 2 3 4 may explain the significantly higher co2 compared to other sites of the oxbow site 1 showed markedly higher alkalinity of surface water during the pre monsoon season the higher alkalinity in the low flood periods could be linked to low water levels within the oxbow and the resultant concentration of salts within the floodplain ufodike et al 2001 since site 1 is farthest from the parent channel its likelihood of inundation will be the least compared to the other oxbow sites during the low flood season chloride concentration in surface water was markedly higher at site 1 during the pre monsoon the variation in water hardness ions and chloride concentrations within the oxbow could also be attributed to low water levels and the resultant concentration of ions during the low flood periods and vice versa koloanda and oladimeji 2004 although the higher mean value of phosphate phosphorus po4 p in the pre monsoon could be linked to concentration effect owing to lower water levels in the oxbow the observation at site 2 indicate site specific augmentation of phosphate levels through the localized introduction of human and animal waste and laundry activities owokotomo et al 2020 the site specific elevated levels of inorganic nitrogen emphasize the role of oxbow physical features and morphology to cause site selective retention of external dissolved substances during and immediately after flood periods johnston et al 1984 the asymmetric features of most oxbows also affect distributions of water quality within their surface area lesack et al 1998 van der peijl and verhoeven 2000 the higher nutrient and turbid conditions of surface water at all the stations compared to station 1 which is farthest from the river may be associated with the distance of the oxbow sites from the parent river channel this channel proximity factor strongly determines the movement of materials from the channel into the oxbow area and thus sites of the oxbow mirror the quality of the areas of the river it is closest to this has been demonstrated in studies that linked turbid and meso eutrophic conditions in oxbows to connectivity with turbid rivers reid and ogden 2009 grundell et al 2012 this is because lotic oxbows are particularly open to the exchange of matter with the river causing higher concentrations of macro elements however the relative connectivity of different parts of the oxbow to the river channel may be directly affecting the environmental parameters i e nutrients phosphorus and nitrogen concentration mineral levels temperature ph and water transparency at each oxbow site van den brink 1994 in essence the proximity of oxbows areas to channels increases connectivity and the accessibility of allochthonous matter and aquatic organisms into lentic oxbow lakes tockner et al 1999 amoros and bornette 2002 discriminant analysis depicting 100 dissimilarity between the sites highlighted temperature 3 80 turbidity 2 18 chlorine 1 51 mg 3 80 inorganic nitrogen 3 66 and total alkalinity 3 12 as the priority variables differentiating the oxbow sites the most supplementary material i the marked levels of mg inorganic nitrogen and total alkalinity at sites 1 2 3 as gradient where site 1 site 2 site 3 is attributable to site specific hydrological conditions owing to lake morphology gallardo et al 2008 glińska lewczuk and burandt 2011 the high gradients of temperature which appeared to be a priority variable in distinguishing the sublocations of the lake i e from site 4 down to site 1 bring to bear the vertical profiles of the oxbow lake and its possible role in the active exchange of ground and surface water the share of riverine and groundwater water sources in supplying oxbow lakes rises and falls on the periodicity of flood pulses when floods abate water is slowly released back to the river galat et al 1998 after which groundwater discharge the oxbow lake dominates over the riverine and transforms properties of water in the lake as such the higher temperature of site 4 may be attributed to the slope being steep enough to drain groundwater out from the aquifer and release it downstream amoros 2001 the increase in cpi value might be due to the increased inflow of pollutants of organic pollutants from the section of the parent channel closest to the oxbow area the hydrological conditions of oxbow lakes directly contribute to chemical and physical modulations with direct effects on the biotic activities and distribution gosselink and turner 1978 depending on the quality of the river channel the periodic flooding of the river during monsoon and post monsoon could impact physical and chemical changes within its floodplain that affect the community structure of local flora and fauna arrington and winemiller 2006 tedesco et al 2008 depictions from this relative abundance of fish species within the lake revealed that cypriniformes was the most abundant in the lake irrespective of site and season this finding may be attributable to oxbow type habitats being preferred by members of cypriniformes reports from three different oxbow lakes in malaysia also demonstrated the dominance of cyprinidae families 45 80 dominating the lakes heng et al 2006 investigations into factors that influence the variation of cyprinid abundances across habitats highlighted habitat type as the most important variable particularly pool type habitats and sustained flooded habitats janáč et al 2010 tesfay et al 2019 this was confirmed from other studies which reported that the abundance of this taxon varied inversely with habitat width and directly with ambient oxygen and alkalinity beamish et al 2006 the abundance of siluriformes as the next most abundant taxa after cypriniformes in the pre monsoon across stations of the oxbow area may also be attributable to habitat type preferences studies testing the hypothesis that fishes differ in habitat preference based on hydraulic characteristics and substrate type demonstrated that members of the siluriformes have a preference for shallow slow flowing habitats with the mud sand substrate costa et al 2013 this may also explain why their abundance is greater in the pre monsoon before the onset of rains perciformes across sites in the oxbow area were the second highest contributors to species diversity during the monsoon and post monsoon this may be attributed to a general preference of perciformes taxa for flowing and deeper water habitat features available during the monsoon rains huang et al 2019 oxbows connected with their parent channel only during high flood periods i e plesiopotamic lakes are notable as environments that support early life stages of many freshwater species grift et al 2003 penczak 2003 particularly for phyto philic species balon 1975 the higher incidence of perciformes during the high flood seasons i e monsoon and post monsoon strongly implicates the increased interconnectivity between the oxbow and the river channel during this season studies on floodplain dynamics hold that the varied constituents of local fish communities align predictably with the hydrological season pekcan hekim 2007 this is plausible because the seasonal flooding and connectivity of oxbows regulate the niche availability i e trophic preferences and spawning patches for several species galacatos et al 2004 neves dos santos et al 2008 the fewer number of species at different areas of the lake at different seasons could be a reflection of the relative carrying capacity of habitat patches within the oxbow lake the modulated chemical and physical features of oxbows due to flood events have direct implications on the activities and distribution of floodplain biota gosselink and turner 1978 tockner et al 2010 from junk s theory it is inferred that the flood pulse is a critical determinant of the productivity of lake river systems and by extension occurrence of species and biodiversity junk 1997 the abundance of fewer species at certain areas of the oxbow lake at certain seasons highlights the succession events and activities of opportunistic species characteristic of oxbow areas the marked alternate hydrological events of oxbow areas favour natural succession allowing adaptive and opportunistic species to coexist amoros and bornette 1999b this feature of frequent succession in oxbow terrains also gives credence to reports that flood pulse experienced by oxbows could make it vulnerable to invasive species of various taxa including fish lóczy et al 2019 the dynamics of changing dominance of species across seasons may be explained on the basis that before flooding seasons scarce resources intensifies niche overlap and a resultant selective survival of species mérona and rankin de mérona 2004 the hills diversity curve asymptote highlighted the significantly different playout of diversity across seasons in addition to the distance of different sites from the parent channel the periodic connectivity portends different risks to the biota of the oxbow lake the periodic flooding and fluctuations in the water level aspetsberger et al 2002 could cause marked gradients in habitat conditions across different parts of the lake amoros and bornette 1999b lóczy et al 2019 resulting in the varied occurrence of diversity and productivity within parts of the lake reese and batzer 2007 sartori et al 2015 fish diversity inclusive nyanti et al 2018 kleinhappel et al 2019 recent studies have highlighted the importance of hydrological connectivity as a key factor influencing the qualitative and quantitative structure of species distribution in oxbow lakes of lowland rivers jakubik 2012 obolewski and gliñska lewczuk 2013 in particular the hydrological connectivity for water mediated transfer of energy sediment and organic matter and organisms within or amongst elements of riverine corridors cabezas et al 2009 gallardo et al 2012 could also function for transport of chemical substances or pollutants in quantities that negatively impact the biodiversity of ecosystems obolewski et al 2009 for instance an increased supply of nutrients into a floodplain lake from its parent could result in massive development of phytoplankton and an inadvertent elimination of stenotopic organisms the significantly higher concentration of dissolved elements in surface water of oxbow areas is reflective of connectivity and resultant inflow of matter and contribution from parent channel compared to disconnected ones glińska lewczuk 2009 the degree of connectivity of a lake with its parent channel determines pathways of nutrient transport resulting in uneven distributions of matter within sites of floodplain oxbows amoros 2001 reduced hydrological connectivity of oxbows with the parent channel during the low flood season has been implicated in lower species diversity and could be attributable to fewer trophic options or spawning patches mérona and rankin de mérona 2004 however the ability of the deltaic lowland area of station 1 to sustain greater species diversity may be attributed to its terrain features within the oxbow area that allows it to trap the excess monsoonal water alongside planktonic resources during the rainy season thus increasing its chances of sustaining a greater number of species in addition the occurrence of species across seasons may be related at least in part to the seasonal variation in water transparency the high relative occurrence of silurifomes taxa a non visually oriented carnivorous species ohara et al 2016 during the pre monsoon or pre flooding period when transparency was higher across sites in the lake exemplifies the role of transparency in shaping trends in species occurence in essence the lower number of fish individuals at the oxbow sites proximal to the parent channel of the oxbow implicates the deteriorated quality of the parent channel and probable local anthropogenic activities furthermore the altered fish diversity in oxbow environments due to connectivity to channels with poor water quality has been reported gell et al 2009 reid and ogden 2009 highlights the fact that connectivity to polluted fluvial sources can alter not only the physical and chemical quality of oxbows but can also modify the biotic components and reduce habitat support for a wider range of species conclusion depending on the distance of oxbow areas to the parent channel and vegetation buffer density as a cofactor periodic floods across seasons affect hydrological connectivity for different parts of the oxbow in a way that affects the physicochemical characteristics this in turn will affect the composition and abundance of fish communities at different points of the lake in essence the incidence of high turbidity and nutrient rich characteristics of stations proximal to the parent channel undoubtedly implicates the quality of surface water flowing into the lake during periodic floods from the parent channel we recommend extensive assessment of floodplain lakes for insight into the dynamics of floodplain connectivity to help identify sites of the oxbow area most sensitive to inputs from impacted watersheds thus aiding decisions in protecting and conserving the rich
