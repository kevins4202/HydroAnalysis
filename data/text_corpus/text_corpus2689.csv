separation 1 introduction zinc is essential as a micronutrient for human health and is the fourth most used metal in the world standing behind iron aluminum and copper it can also be recycled without losing its physicochemical properties around 60 of the produced zinc is used in galvanizing processes as a sacrificial metal the estimated world zinc consumption is 16 million tons per year in which 12 million tons come from primary sources and 4 million from recycled sources 1 according to the london metal exchange website the commercial value of this metal is us 2585 per ton 2 there are a variety of metallurgical processes that can be employed for the recovery of zinc mainly pyrometallurgical 3 4 and hydrometallurgical methodologies 4 such as precipitation 5 ion exchange membrane separation 6 7 and liquid liquid extraction 8 9 among these processes solvent extraction sx is a strategical hydrometallurgical separation process used on a commercial scale due to the growing demand for high purity metals 10 the strict environmental regulations the demand of lower production costs and the decreased production in high quality ore reserves the process of obtaining zinc through hydrometallurgical routes consists of leaching the metal from primary or secondary sources 11 12 followed by a precipitation treatment 5 13 in the solvent extraction stage the liquor is held in contact with an organic solvent and an extracting agent for the selective recovery of zinc 14 15 then the extracting phase is subjected to the stripping step to allow recovery of the metal in its free form for later electrodeposition 15 16 most sx methodologies use organic solvents such as kerosene 17 18 which is very flammable and non biodegradable contradicting the need for more sustainable and environmentally safe processes in view of this the aqueous two phase systems atps technique is an interesting strategy to replace traditional solvent extraction since its efficiency in the recovery of strategic metals from several different matrices has already been proven 19 23 atps is made up mostly of water and may contain a polymer 24 or an ionic liquid and an electrolyte in its composition which generally have low toxicity and low cost 25 27 after the phase separation under specific thermodynamic conditions atps generally have a top phase tp which is rich in polymer and poor in electrolyte and a bottom phase bp which is poor in polymer and rich in electrolyte 28 atps have shown great potential due to the possibility of using both hydrophobic and hydrophilic extracting agents 29 31 many reported works have applied these systems for the selective recovery of metals from primary 32 33 and secondary sources 25 34 36 leite and collaborators optimized a separation methodology for zn2 and mn2 ii using alkaline battery leachate liquor through atps a separation factor szn mn of 1 2 106 was obtained in just one extraction step in an atps formed by l64 and na2so4 using dithizone as an extracting agent 37 lemos et al investigated the separation of copper from an ore leachate employing atps as the extraction technique the developed method showed that all cu2 could be extracted at ph 3 00 using pan 1 2 pyridylazo 2 naphtol as the extracting agent the other metals fe3 co2 ni2 and zn2 present in the leachate were mainly concentrated in the bottom phase e 7 69 the stripping assays provided recovery of cu2 close to 90 therefore these results demonstrated the high efficiency of the atps technique to recover metals from a complex sample 32 based on the efficiency of atps for metal recovery a mining concentrated liquor was used for the first time as a stock solution for the in situ preparation of an atps the liquor was a complex solution with a high content of metal ions especially zn2 and mg2 thus this work aimed to recover zn 2 efficiently minimizing the reagent consumption and agreeing with the green chemistry principles applying atps as the extraction technique in view of this was developed an efficient applied and sustainable methodology for the recovery of zinc from a mining concentrated liquor through the optimization of experimental variables such as the nature of the atps forming polymer copolymer and their concentration the effect of salt the effect of the extracting agent and its concentration and also the mass ratio between both phases stripping experiments and reused reagent studies were also carried out 2 experimental 2 1 equipment a phmeter hi 2221 hanna was used to perform ph adjustments atps stock solutions were weighed using

germany 2 3 atps composition and liquid liquid extraction procedure the sulfuric liquor containing high concentrations of zn2 and mg2 was centrifuged at 2500 rpm 560 x g during 5 min to separate the particulate material and obtain a homogeneous and representative sample in general the preparation of the atps was performed by mixing a specific mass of a polymer stock solution l64 l35 or peg 1500 with a specific mass of the concentrated liquor in test tubes which were manually shaken during 3 min then the atps assays were placed in a thermostatic bath for 30 min at 333 15 k to ensure the thermal equilibrium as can be seen in fig 1 the extraction studies were performed in successive steps in which a new polymer stock solution was added to bp 1 to prepare a new atps then the top phase was collected for magnesium quantification by faas and zinc was quantified by complexometric titration using xylenol orange as indicator all experiments were performed in triplicate at 333 15 k which is the temperature that the liquor is held after leaching in the industrial process the ph value and dilution factor of the pure sulfuric liquor have not been changed during the procedure 2 4 evaluation of extraction procedure the top phase tp of each tube was collected and diluted appropriately when necessary for analysis by faas an analytical curve of mg2 was used to obtain the concentration values for analysis of zn2 the tp was directly titrated with edta ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid using xylenol orange as an indicator the percentage of mg2 and zn2 extraction e was calculated from eq 1 1 e n t p n t o t a l x 100 where n t p is the amount of substance of metal ions in the top phase and n t o t a l is the total mols number of metals ions in the system another parameter used to assess the extraction efficiency was the distribution coefficient d m obtained from eq 2 2 d m e m 100 e m where e m is the metal extraction percentage 2 5 parameters optimized in the extraction procedure atps parameters were studied to optimize the extraction conditions for zn2 and mg2 separation since pure liquor has been used as a stock solution for the atps formation there are no phase diagrams available in the literature to describe the exact composition of the system thus the following parameters were investigated concentration of the polymer stock solution 40 50 and 60 w w atps forming polymer copolymer l64 l35 and peg 1500 the effect of the salt addition to the liquor na3c6h5o2 2h2o concentration of extractant agent kscn 0 00 to 0 50 mol kg 1 and mass ratio between top mtp and bottom mbp phases mtp mbp 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 sample characterization first the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 2500 rpm 560 x g to separate the particulate material and obtain a homogeneous and representative sample after centrifugation the ph of the supernatant was measured which was equal to 4 28 subsequently the constituents of the liquor were quantified by faas table 1 summarizes the concentration of the main metal ions in the sample after characterization it was possible to confirm the high concentration of zinc and magnesium in the sample in comparison to other metal ions therefore this liquor was used in subsequent studies to optimize the separation process between zinc and magnesium in atps 3 2 atps forming polymers in studies involving the partition of metallic ions the nature of the atps forming polymer is an especially important variable since the polymers have considerable differences in their hydrophobicity and molar masses their chemical properties can influence the phase viscosity and consequently the phase separation time however the purpose of this study was to use the pure liquor as a stock solution and to evaluate the formation of the systems with the addition of peg 1500 l64 and l35 solutions in different concentrations these atps forming polymers were chosen because they have already been widely applied in other works involving metallic ion partitioning in atps 22 25 34 37 38 the stock solutions had a concentration between 30 and 60 w w of the polymer however the atps assays were only formed with stock solutions of l35 and l64 at 30 and 40 w w and peg 1500 at 40 50 and 60 w w among these the systems formed by peg 1500 showed a faster phase separation in addition to generating systems with less viscosity with no need for centrifugation these technical features contribute to a shorter processing time enabling the application of the methodology on a large scale furthermore this polymer has a lower cost compared to the copolymers evaluated because of this peg 1500 was applied as the atps forming polymer in the subsequent studies 3 3 effect of salt and extracting agent the influence of the addition of salt and extracting agent on the extraction behavior of zn2 and mg2 in atps were studied as the bottom phase is rich in electrolyte the salt added to the system will probably concentrate in the bottom phase due to strong ion ion interactions so the electrolyte forming anion can interact with the metal ions electrostatically or by complexation inhibiting its partition to the top phase in view of this the effect of the presence of sodium citrate an electrolyte commonly used in metal extraction studies in atps was evaluated 37 39 40 the analytes extraction behavior was also evaluated in the presence of the thiocyanate ion scn as an extracting agent which has already demonstrated significant results for some metals 29 41 scn has high water solubility which improves the operating conditions of the system formed by peg 1500 a highly hydrophilic polymer first the effect of sodium citrate in the presence of scn on the partition of the analytes in atps was studied fig 2 illustrates the extraction behavior of zn2 and mg2 in atps formed by sulfuric liquor peg 1500 60 w w in the presence of scn 0 2 mol kg 1 a or scn 0 2 mol kg 1 and na3c6h5o7 5 w w b in the absence of citrate fig 2a the extraction efficiency of zn2 and mg2 were ezn 40 1 and emg 14 1 0 7 in four successive extraction steps the addition of sodium citrate fig 2b provided a significant increase in the extraction of zn2 and mg2 in four extraction steps ezn 48 3 0 2 and emg 24 5 were obtained while an extra step provided ezn 54 3 and emg 26 4 thus the citrate ion contributed to an increase in the extraction efficiency of both analytes probably due to the formation of stable complexes with both zn and mg2 which are partitioned to the atps top phase in order to improve the zinc extraction efficiency and the separation of the analytes subsequent studies were carried out in different concentrations of scn in atps formed by sulfuric liquor peg 1500 60 w w in the presence of sodium citrate 5 w w fig 3 shows the e values of zn2 and mg2 as a function of the scn concentration in the polymer stock solution analyzing fig 3 the concentration of scn influences the extraction behavior of both analytes especially magnesium there was a gradual drop in extraction efficiency with an increase in the thiocyanate amount thus with a scn concentration equal to 0 5 mol kg 1 in five extraction steps the extraction percentage obtained was ezn 58 2 and emg 2 28 0 03 with czn 7300 mg kg 1 and cmg 40 mg kg 1 in the top phase this corresponds to a concentration ratio czn cmg of approximately 187 an increase of the scn concentration causes the mg2 extraction to decrease the mg2 concentration in the liquor is much lower than the zn2 concentration table 1 so it is expected that the extraction efficiency of magnesium will be more influenced by the s c n variations while the increments in ezn it is not so pronounced as thiocyanate forms stable complexes with zn2 and has greater affinity for the atps top phase a competition between mg2 and s c n species for the interaction sites present in tp can take place resulting in a lower extraction efficiency of mg 2 therefore the best separation condition between zn2 and mg2 obtained and fixed for subsequent experiments was in the presence of scn 0 5 mol kg 1 and sodium citrate 5 w w the extraction procedure was performed in five stages except in phase mass ratio stripping and precipitation studies in which different numbers of extraction steps were applied 3 4 effect of polymer concentration as atps was formed through a mixture of pure liquor with a polymer stock solution the effect of the peg 1500 concentration on the extraction behavior of zn2 and mg2 was evaluated it is known that the polymer is mainly concentrated in the atps top phase as the amount of peg increases it causes variations in the viscosity of the tp influencing the phase separation time as well as the partition of the analytes 42 fig 4 shows the e of zn2 and mg2 as a function of the polymer concentration in the stock solution in atps formed by sulfuric liquor peg 1500 in the presence of scn 0 5 mol kg 1 and sodium citrate 5 w w according to fig 4 the peg concentration considerably influenced the analytes partition in atps the extraction percentage obtained for zn2 and mg2 when applied to a polymer concentration equal to 40 w w was practically the same close to 60 at peg concentration equal to 60 w w the extraction efficiency were ezn 58 2 and emg 2 28 0 03 but under these conditions a gelatinous solid was formed and deposited at the bottom of the tube however a higher extraction efficiency ezn 79 1 was obtained for zn2 in five extraction steps using peg 50 w w the concentration in the extracting phase was czn 7000 mg kg 1 and cmg 160 mg kg 1 as can be seen in figure s1 in the supporting information two distinct effects on the extraction behavior of zn2 and mg2 can be observed firstly when the peg 1500 concentration in the stock solution was equal to 40 w w the extraction percentage of both analytes was close to 60 however in systems with a polymer concentration equal to 50 w w a significant improvement in the separation between the analytes was observed the zn scn complex tends to partition at a higher rate into the atps top phase with an increasing polymer concentration because of the greater zn scn partition there may be competition with the mg 2 ion for the interaction sites in the extracting phase thereby decreasing the emg another effect observed when increasing the polymer concentration to 60 w w was the decrease in the efficiency of the ezn and emg as the concentration of mg2 in the liquor is much lower than zn 2 the variation in extraction efficiency with increasing polymer concentration is more pronounced in higher polymer concentrations the atps phases become more distinct which may increase the top phase viscosity and consequently the surface tension between phases these factors can affect the analytes partition and inhibit the transfer to the top phase this phenomenon has also been observed in other works involving metallic ion partitioning in atps 43 44 thus the subsequent studies were carried out employing atps formed by sulfuric liquor peg 1500 at 50 w w in the presence of scn 0 5 mol kg 1 and sodium citrate 5 w w 3 5 study of phase mass ratio the effect of the mass ratio between top and bottom phases mtp mbp of the atps was evaluated it is worth mentioning that there are no phase diagrams available in the literature to describe the exact composition of this particular system formed by mining liquor solution therefore we consider that the masses of the atps phases corresponded to the polymer stock solution and liquor masses if this methodology is adopted these results will be obtained and will be reproducible the expectation of this study was to find a compromise condition between extraction efficiency and pre concentration of zn2 in the top phase therefore a decrease in the cost of the process is expected especially in the consumption of the polymer which is the most expensive component used in atps fig 5 shows the e of zn2 and mg2 as a function of the mass ratio a mtp mbp 0 5 b mtp mbp 1 0 and c mtp mbp 2 0 in atps formed by sulfuric liquor peg 1500 50 w w in the presence of scn 0 5 mol kg 1 and sodium citrate 5 w w the mass ratio studies mtp mbp were performed with the maximum possible number of steps in the system aiming for a high e of zn2 and a better separation between analytes fig 5a and b show a saturation of the system tp from the 7th successive extraction step when using mtp mbp 0 5 ezn 60 and mtp mbp 1 0 ezn 90 respectively however in the study of mtp mbp 2 0 approximately 100 of zn2 had been recovered in four extraction steps in systems where the tp mass is lower than the bp mass a pre concentration of the analytes in the tp and a low extraction efficiency are expected since a lower number of interaction sites between the zn scn species and the macromolecules of the copolymer were available in the extracting phase on the other hand in systems with a mass ratio greater than one mtp mbp 1 0 it is possible to obtain a greater extraction capacity of analytes in fewer successive extraction steps therefore the mass ratio system equal to 2 0 showed better results for the e of zn2 although the zn2 recovery was close to 100 in four extraction steps with mtp mbp 2 0 with distribution factors d m g 0 36 and d z n 2905 the formation of a precipitate occurred in this system which can be an obstacle when the methodology is scaled up however in three extraction steps a high extraction efficiency was obtained ezn 91 4 0 1 with distribution factors d m g 0 22 and d z n 48 50 and an overall concentration of zn2 equal to 5742 29 mg kg 1 and mg2 equal to 164 1 mg kg 1 in the extracting phase as can be seen in figure s2 in the supporting information under this condition the concentration ratio between zn2 and mg2 czn mg was approximately 52 a value considerably higher than the one found in the original sulfuric liquor czn mg 7 therefore the subsequent study was carried out with a mass ratio equal to 2 0 applying three extraction steps in atps formed by sulfuric liquor peg 1500 50 w w in the presence of scn 0 5 mol kg 1 and sodium citrate 5 w w 3 6 stripping in traditional sx plants after the separation stage the extracting phase is submitted to a stripping process to recover the analyte in its ionic free form in solution or as pure solid for this the stripping study was performed in two ways by placing the extracting phase in contact with a na2so4 solution or using naoh as the precipitating agent fig 6 a shows the results of the percentage of stripping s in successive stripping steps of zn2 and mg2 in atps formed by peg 1500 50 w w na2so4 20 w w in the presence of scn 0 5 mol kg 1 and sodium citrate 5 w w as a function of the number of extraction steps in atps fig 6b illustrates the percentage of precipitation ppt of zn2 and mg2 from the extracting phase as a function of the medium ph after three extraction steps the results for stripping in atps using a stock solution of na2so4 20 w w show that in the second extraction step all magnesium was recovered for the electrolyte rich phase while for zn2 after five steps of extraction the recovery was close to 40 in the precipitation study at ph 9 00 the recovery percentage for zn2 was approximately 80 and was close to 55 for mg2 despite increasing the pre concentration of zn2 in the stripping study with na2so4 the recovery was less than 40 however at ph 6 00 about 65 of zn2 was precipitated in the form of hydroxide while mg2 remained in the supernatant this behavior generated a solid with a high purity of zn and therefore provided a better separation between the analytes these results are satisfactory since the objective of this work was to recover zinc selectively 3 7 reuse of the extracting phase to reduce process costs and make the methodology even more sustainable after the precipitation study the supernatant was reused to evaluate the performance of atps in one more extracting step without any addition of further reagents the extracting phase was placed in contact with pure liquor to allow the formation of a new atps fig 7 illustrates the e of zn2 and mg2 as a function of the ph of the top phase in atps formed by sulfuric liquor peg 1500 50 w w in the presence of scn 0 5 mol kg 1 and sodium citrate 5 w w with mtp mbp 2 0 at ph 9 00 ezn 54 2 was obtained in just one extraction step however precipitate formation occurred probably due to the high ph value at ph 7 00 ezn 46 2 and emg 11 1 were obtained under this condition the separation between the analytes had decreased in comparison with the extraction efficiency in a system with new tp fig 5c 1 st step although the top phase still had a great extractive capacity even without the addition of scn and sodium citrate these results prove that it is possible to reuse the system components in a simple way with satisfactory extraction efficiency results therefore the atps technique is sustainable as there is low residue production the ability to reuse reagents mainly the polymer and extracting agent in addition to the saving of water which can greatly decrease production costs 4 conclusion a low cost and low environmental impact methodology were developed for the selective recovery of zn2 from a concentrated sulfuric liquor which was used without dilution in the formation of the atps the optimized atps composed of sulfuric liquor peg 1500 50 w w in the presence of scn 0 5 mol kg 1 and sodium citrate 5 w w in a mass ratio equal to mtp mbp 2 0 proved to be an efficient system for separating the main analytes present in the liquor zn2 and mg2 under these conditions it was possible to extract 91 5 0 1 of zn2 and 18 2 0 1 of mg with distribution factors d m g 0 22 and d z n 48 50 resulting in a final concentration ratio czn mg 52 finally about 65 of zn2 was recovered in the hydroxide form by precipitation while the mg2 remained in its totality in the supernatant using naoh as a precipitating agent for the first time it was proven that it is possible to reuse the components of the atps mainly the polymer and the extracting agent to still achieve a high extraction efficiency ezn 45 therefore there is the possibility of a significant reduction in process costs as well as in the generation of waste in this perspective the method developed proved to be suitable for the selective recovery of zinc in a complex matrix making the metal ion in the form of hydroxide available at the end of the process which can be easily solubilized for later electrodeposition consequently the atps extraction process added to the precipitation step has a high potential for industrial application declaration of competing interest no

parameter used to assess the extraction efficiency was the distribution coefficient d m obtained from eq 2 2 d m e m 100 e m where e m is the metal extraction percentage 2 5 parameters optimized in the extraction procedure atps parameters were studied to optimize the extraction conditions for zn2 and mg2 separation since pure liquor has been used as a stock solution for the atps formation there are no phase diagrams available in the literature to describe the exact composition of the system thus the following parameters were investigated concentration of the polymer stock solution 40 50 and 60 w w atps forming polymer copolymer l64 l35 and peg 1500 the effect of the salt addition to the liquor na3c6h5o2 2h2o concentration of extractant agent kscn 0 00 to 0 50 mol kg 1 and mass ratio between top mtp and bottom mbp phases mtp mbp 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 sample characterization first the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 2500 rpm 560 x g to separate the particulate material and obtain a homogeneous and representative sample after centrifugation the ph of the supernatant was measured which was equal to 4 28 subsequently the constituents of the liquor were quantified by faas table 1 summarizes the concentration of the main metal ions in the sample after characterization it was possible to confirm the high concentration of zinc and magnesium in the sample in comparison to other metal ions therefore this liquor was used in subsequent studies to optimize the separation process between zinc and magnesium in atps 3 2 atps forming polymers in studies involving the partition of metallic ions the nature of the atps forming polymer is an especially important variable since the polymers have considerable differences in their hydrophobicity and molar masses their chemical properties can influence the phase viscosity and consequently the phase separation time however the purpose of this study was to use the pure liquor as a stock solution and to evaluate the formation of the systems with the addition of peg 1500 l64 and l35 solutions in different concentrations these atps forming polymers were chosen because they have already been widely applied in other works involving metallic ion partitioning in atps 22 25 34 37 38 the stock solutions had a concentration between 30 and 60 w w of the polymer however the atps assays were only formed with stock solutions of l35 and l64 at 30 and 40 w w and peg 1500 at 40 50 and 60 w w among these the systems formed by peg 1500 showed a faster phase separation in addition to generating systems with less viscosity with no need for centrifugation these technical features contribute to a shorter processing time enabling the application of the methodology on a large scale furthermore this polymer has a lower cost compared to the copolymers evaluated because of this peg 1500 was applied as the atps forming polymer in the subsequent studies 3 3 effect of salt and extracting agent the influence of the addition of salt and extracting agent on the extraction behavior of zn2 and mg2 in atps were studied as the bottom phase is rich in electrolyte the salt added to the system will probably concentrate in the bottom phase due to strong ion ion interactions so the electrolyte forming anion can interact with the metal ions electrostatically or by complexation inhibiting its partition to the top phase in view of this the effect of the presence of sodium citrate an electrolyte commonly used in metal extraction studies in atps was evaluated 37 39 40 the analytes extraction behavior was also evaluated in the presence of the thiocyanate ion scn as an extracting agent which has already demonstrated significant results for some metals 29 41 scn has high water solubility which improves the operating conditions of the system formed by peg 1500 a highly hydrophilic polymer first the effect of sodium citrate in the presence of scn on the partition of the analytes in atps was studied fig 2 illustrates the extraction behavior of zn2 and mg2 in atps formed by sulfuric liquor peg 1500 60 w w in the presence of scn 0 2 mol kg 1 a or scn 0 2 mol kg 1 and na3c6h5o7 5 w w b in the absence of citrate fig 2a the extraction efficiency of zn2 and mg2 were ezn 40 1 and emg 14 1 0 7 in four successive extraction steps the addition of sodium citrate fig 2b provided a significant increase in the extraction of zn2 and mg2 in four extraction steps ezn 48 3 0 2 and emg 24 5 were obtained while an extra step provided ezn 54 3 and emg 26 4 thus the citrate ion contributed to an increase in the extraction efficiency of both analytes probably due to the formation of stable complexes with both zn and mg2 which are partitioned to the atps top phase in order to improve the zinc extraction efficiency and the separation of the analytes subsequent studies were carried out in different concentrations of scn in atps formed by sulfuric liquor peg 1500 60 w w in the presence of sodium citrate 5 w w fig 3 shows the e values of zn2 and mg2 as a function of the scn concentration in the polymer stock solution analyzing fig 3 the concentration of scn influences the extraction behavior of both analytes especially magnesium there was a gradual drop in extraction efficiency with an increase in the thiocyanate amount thus with a scn concentration equal to 0 5 mol kg 1 in five extraction steps the extraction percentage obtained was ezn 58 2 and emg 2 28 0 03 with czn 7300 mg kg 1 and cmg 40 mg kg 1 in the top phase this corresponds to a concentration ratio czn cmg of approximately 187 an increase of the scn concentration causes the mg2 extraction to decrease the mg2 concentration in the liquor is much lower than the zn2 concentration table 1 so it is expected that the extraction efficiency of magnesium will be more influenced by the s c n variations while the increments in ezn it is not so pronounced as thiocyanate forms stable complexes with zn2 and has greater affinity for the atps top phase a competition between mg2 and s c n species for the interaction sites present in tp can take place resulting in a lower extraction efficiency of mg 2 therefore the best separation condition between zn2 and mg2 obtained and fixed for subsequent experiments was in the presence of scn 0 5 mol kg 1 and sodium citrate 5 w w the extraction procedure was performed in five stages except in phase mass ratio stripping and precipitation studies in which different numbers of extraction steps were applied 3 4 effect of polymer concentration as atps was formed through a mixture of pure liquor with a polymer stock solution the effect of the peg 1500 concentration on the extraction behavior of zn2 and mg2 was evaluated it is known that the polymer is mainly concentrated in the atps top phase as the amount of peg increases it causes variations in the viscosity of the tp influencing the phase separation time as well as the partition of the analytes 42 fig 4 shows the e of zn2 and mg2 as a function of the polymer concentration in the stock solution in atps formed by sulfuric liquor peg 1500 in the presence of scn 0 5 mol kg 1 and sodium citrate 5 w w according to fig 4 the peg concentration considerably influenced the analytes partition in atps the extraction percentage obtained for zn2 and mg2 when applied to a polymer concentration equal to 40 w w was practically the same close to 60 at peg concentration equal to 60 w w the extraction efficiency were ezn 58 2 and emg 2 28 0 03 but under these conditions a gelatinous solid was formed and deposited at the bottom of the tube however a higher extraction efficiency ezn 79 1 was obtained for zn2 in five extraction steps using peg 50 w w the concentration in the extracting phase was czn 7000 mg kg 1 and cmg 160 mg kg 1 as can be seen in figure s1 in the supporting information two distinct effects on the extraction behavior of zn2 and mg2 can be observed firstly when the peg 1500 concentration in the stock solution was equal to 40 w w the extraction percentage of both analytes was close to 60 however in systems with a polymer concentration equal to 50 w w a significant improvement in the separation between the analytes was observed the zn scn complex tends to partition at a higher rate into the atps top phase with an increasing polymer concentration because of the greater zn scn partition there may be competition with the mg 2 ion for the interaction sites in the extracting phase thereby decreasing the emg another effect observed when increasing the polymer concentration to 60 w w was the decrease in the efficiency of the ezn and emg as the concentration of mg2 in the liquor is much lower than zn 2 the variation in extraction efficiency with increasing polymer concentration is more pronounced in higher polymer concentrations the atps phases become more distinct which may increase the top phase viscosity and consequently the surface tension between phases these factors can affect the analytes partition and inhibit the transfer to the top phase this phenomenon has also been observed in other works involving metallic ion partitioning in atps 43 44 thus the subsequent studies were carried out employing atps formed by sulfuric liquor peg 1500 at 50 w w in the presence of scn 0 5 mol kg 1 and sodium citrate 5 w w 3 5 study of phase mass ratio the effect of the mass ratio between top and bottom phases mtp mbp of the atps was evaluated it is worth mentioning that there are no phase diagrams available in the literature to describe the exact composition of this particular system formed by mining liquor solution therefore we consider that the masses of the atps phases corresponded to the polymer stock solution and liquor masses if this methodology is adopted these results will be obtained and will be reproducible the expectation of this study was to find a compromise condition between extraction efficiency and pre concentration of zn2 in the top phase therefore a decrease in the cost of the process is expected especially in the consumption of the polymer which is the most expensive component used in atps fig 5 shows the e of zn2 and mg2 as a function of the mass ratio a mtp mbp 0 5 b mtp mbp 1 0 and c mtp mbp 2 0 in atps formed by sulfuric liquor peg 1500 50 w w in the presence of scn 0 5 mol kg 1 and sodium citrate 5 w w the mass ratio studies mtp mbp were performed with the maximum possible number of steps in the system aiming for a high e of zn2 and a better separation between analytes fig 5a and b show a saturation of the system tp from the 7th successive extraction step when using mtp mbp 0 5 ezn 60 and mtp mbp 1 0 ezn 90 respectively however in the study of mtp mbp 2 0 approximately 100 of zn2 had been recovered in four extraction steps in systems where the tp mass is lower than the bp mass a pre concentration of the analytes in the tp and a low extraction efficiency are expected since a lower number of interaction sites between the zn scn species and the macromolecules of the copolymer were available in the extracting phase on the other hand in systems with a mass ratio greater than one mtp mbp 1 0 it is possible to obtain a greater extraction capacity of analytes in fewer successive extraction steps therefore the mass ratio system equal to 2 0 showed better results for the e of zn2 although the zn2 recovery was close to 100 in four extraction steps with mtp mbp 2 0 with distribution factors d m g 0 36 and d z n 2905 the formation of a precipitate occurred in this system which can be an obstacle when the methodology is scaled up however in three extraction steps a high extraction efficiency was obtained ezn 91 4 0 1 with distribution factors d m g 0 22 and d z n 48 50 and an overall concentration of zn2 equal to 5742 29 mg kg 1 and mg2 equal to 164 1 mg kg 1 in the extracting phase as can be seen in figure s2 in the supporting information under this condition the concentration ratio between zn2 and mg2 czn mg was approximately 52 a value considerably higher than the one found in the original sulfuric liquor czn mg 7 therefore the subsequent study was carried out with a mass ratio equal to 2 0 applying three extraction steps in atps formed by sulfuric liquor peg 1500 50 w w in the presence of scn 0 5 mol kg 1 and sodium citrate 5 w w 3 6 stripping in traditional sx plants after the separation stage the extracting phase is submitted to a stripping process to recover the analyte in its ionic free form in solution or as pure solid for this the stripping study was performed in two ways by placing the extracting phase in contact with a na2so4 solution or using naoh as the precipitating agent fig 6 a shows the results of the percentage of stripping s in successive stripping steps of zn2 and mg2 in atps formed by peg 1500 50 w w na2so4 20 w w in the presence of scn 0 5 mol kg 1 and sodium citrate 5 w w as a function of the number of extraction steps in atps fig 6b illustrates the percentage of precipitation ppt of zn2 and mg2 from the extracting phase as a function of the medium ph after three extraction steps the results for stripping in atps using a stock solution of na2so4 20 w w show that in the second extraction step all magnesium was recovered for the electrolyte rich phase while for zn2 after five steps of extraction the recovery was close to 40 in the precipitation study at ph 9 00 the recovery percentage for zn2 was approximately 80 and was close to 55 for mg2 despite increasing the pre concentration of zn2 in the stripping study with na2so4 the recovery was less than 40 however at ph 6 00 about 65 of zn2 was precipitated in the form of hydroxide while mg2 remained in the supernatant this behavior generated a solid with a high purity of zn and therefore provided a better separation between the analytes these results are satisfactory since the objective of this work was to recover zinc selectively 3 7 reuse of the extracting phase to reduce process costs and make the methodology even more sustainable after the precipitation study the supernatant was reused to evaluate the performance of atps in one more extracting step without any addition of further reagents the extracting phase was placed in contact with pure liquor to allow the formation of a new atps fig 7 illustrates the e of zn2 and mg2 as a function of the ph of the top phase in atps formed by sulfuric liquor peg 1500 50 w w in the presence of scn 0 5 mol kg 1 and sodium citrate 5 w w with mtp mbp 2 0 at ph 9 00 ezn 54 2 was obtained in just one extraction step however precipitate formation occurred probably due to the high ph value at ph 7 00 ezn 46 2 and emg 11 1 were obtained under this condition the separation between the analytes had decreased in comparison with the extraction efficiency in a system with new tp fig 5c 1 st step although the top phase still had a great extractive capacity even without the addition of scn and sodium citrate these results prove that it is possible to reuse the system components in a simple way with satisfactory extraction efficiency results therefore the atps technique is sustainable as there is low residue production the ability to reuse reagents mainly the polymer and extracting agent in addition to the saving of water which can greatly decrease production costs 4 conclusion a low cost and low environmental impact methodology were developed for the selective recovery of zn2 from a concentrated sulfuric liquor which was used without dilution in the formation of the atps the optimized atps composed of sulfuric liquor peg 1500 50 w w in the presence of scn 0 5 mol kg 1 and sodium citrate 5 w w in a mass ratio equal to mtp mbp 2 0 proved to be an efficient system for separating the main analytes present in the liquor zn2 and mg2 under these conditions it was possible to extract 91 5 0 1 of zn2 and 18 2 0 1 of mg with distribution factors d m g 0 22 and d z n 48 50 resulting in a final concentration ratio czn mg 52 finally about 65 of zn2 was recovered in the hydroxide form by precipitation while the mg2 remained in its totality in the supernatant using naoh as a precipitating agent for the first time it was proven that it is possible to reuse the components of the atps mainly the polymer and the extracting agent to still achieve a high extraction efficiency ezn 45 therefore there is the possibility of a significant reduction in process costs as well as in the generation of waste in this perspective the method developed proved to be suitable for the selective recovery of zinc in a complex matrix making the metal ion in the form of hydroxide available at the end of the process which can be easily solubilized for later electrodeposition consequently the atps extraction process added to the precipitation step has a high potential for industrial application declaration of competing interest no

coagulation has been widely applied to destabilize algae and improve algae removal through a flocculation sedimentation process in drinking water treatment plants dwtps however oxidation poses a potential threat to drinking water safety with increasing algal organic matter aom in the algae polluted surface water this study investigated the effect of sodium hypochlorite naocl oxidation assisted polyaluminum chloride pacl coagulation on algae removal along with the identification of the optical properties for aom fractions the results have demonstrated that the increased naocl oxidant dose coupled with pacl coagulation induced by sweep flocculation is more effective in microcystis aeruginosa ma cells destabilization and removal where the highest algae removal rate around 99 however naocl oxidation coupled with pacl coagulation fails to reduce the dissolved organic carbon doc in ma suspension attributed to the released aom strong free chlorine destroys ma cells in response to the increases in humic acid like hal and fulvic acid like fal substances while it is sufficient to degrade soluble microbial product like smpl and aromatic protein like apl substances in oxidation assisted coagulation bigger diameter 483 640 μm with lower fractal dimension 1 31 1 39 of m aeruginosa flocs are formed at low chlorine dosing ratio cl2 doc 1 1 while higher fractal dimension 2 39 2 75 with smaller diameter 143 395 μm is reached at high chlorine dosing ratio cl2 doc 3 1 it is concluded that the changes in fluorescent organic matter fraction during chlorination dominantly affect coagulation performance for aom removal in oxidation coagulation process keywords water treatment oxidation coagulation algogenic organic matter al hydrates 1 introduction eutrophication of surface water is a worldwide environmental problem with negative impacts on aquatic ecosystems the presence of excessive nutrients usually causes eutrophication to stimulate algae growth 1 such as microcystis aeruginosa as one of the most dominant cyanobacteria species in warm shallow and nutrition rich water bodies 2 when algal blooms occur in aquatic ecosystems the conventional water treatments are unable to deal with increased cell concentration especially with an increase in algal organic matter aom 3 algae produce aom in response to stressful conditions such as low nutrient concentrations absence of light low ph and extreme temperature changes 4 aom mainly classified as extracellular organic matter eom which is formed outside the cell deriving from metabolic excretion and intracellular organic matter iom which is secreted via intracellular autolysis 5 generally both eom and iom originated from the algal cell that can be a significant part of natural organic matter nom in the algae laden water body 6 the cyanobacteria such as microcystis aeruginosa ma commonly exist in drinking water reservoirs ma has been proven that its metabolism in drinking water is toxic to human beings caused by intracellular toxin release 7 therefore it is essential to remove harmful algae from water for drinking water plants dwtps oxidation has been widely used to enhance algae removal by coagulation and sedimentation processes in drinking water treatment 8 the chemical of oxidant can improve algae coagulation by inactivating algal cells destabilizing of algal cells and fragments or liberating extracellular organic matter eom 9 sodium hypochlorite naocl is commonly used as chlorine based disinfectants for algae laden water oxidation because it has a strong ability to improve algal removal by algal inactivation effect during pre treatment 10 furthermore overdosing of chlorine can influence the cell integrity 11 or damage algal cells by the diffusion of hocl and ocl at neutral ph to rupture the cell and induced aom released 12 therefore oxidation strategies such as dosage and mixing time should be considered to improve algal cell removal efficiency after a coagulation sedimentation process in dwtps as a critical step of algal removal increasing the coagulant dose may reduce the adverse effects of aom to some extent aom at low concentration was reported to act as an inter particle bridge to facilitate the removal of particles 13 in contrast aom at a high level can affect coagulation and increased coagulant demand to destabilized algae cells 12 furthermore the aom coagulant complexes formation could impede coagulant hydrolysis 14 polyaluminum chloride pacl has been commonly used as a pre hydrolyzed coagulant its al species distribution strongly affects the efficiency of organic matter destabilization and particle aggregation rate in drinking water treatment 15 commercial pacl species coagulant distribution is generally described as a monomer ala polymer alb or colloidal al alc the coagulation performance in water treatment is known to be subjected to hydrolyzed al species 14 prestudies have indicated that pre hydrolyzed colloidal al alc plays an important role in particle destabilization for effective floc formation by enhanced sweep coagulation 15 18 in algae laden water treatment by coagulation hydrolyzed al species composition is dominant for algae rich water treatment 19 in practice microalgae are light and their cellular metabolisms are more hydrophilic resulting in insufficient coagulation for aom removal in dwtps thus it is crucial to forming large and compact floc in response to fast solid liquid separation for algae laden water treatment by coagulation with al hydrates many studies have investigated the effect of chlorination on cell integrity and aom release from algal cells and their impacts on pacl coagulation for algae destabilization 10 12 20 however limited studies have investigated the effect of oxidation assisted coagulation on aom release and degradation and the effect of its fraction changes on organic matter destabilization with al hydrates and the minimization of ma algae the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of oxidation assisted coagulation on algae removal and aom fraction changes by determining the optimal oxidation strategy to achieve effective aom removal by pacl coagulation sedimentation 2 materials and methods 2 1 algae cultivation freshwater cyanobacteria microcystis aeruginosa ma were taken from the drinking water reservoir of matsu island taiwan it was purified before culturing and then cultured in several 500 ml flasks containing bg 11 sterilized algal growth media following a previous study 21 algal cultures were housed in a continuous automated flask shaker at room temperature 25 c 1 c and provided with tl5 lamps of illumination on 16 h light 8 h dark cycle 22 the growth conditions were measured periodically every four days with analysis of total cells using luna fl automated fluorescence cell counter logos south korea together with cell viability measurement to quantify the number of living and dead cells during algal cell cultivation the ma cells were harvested in the exponential phases fig s1 when the solution stock has reached around 1 107 cells ml optical density od measurement was investigated using spectrophotometer by chlorophyll a content measurement 23 with the absorbance of chlorophyll a existing in all microalgae about 680 nm 24 the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration in the solution was measured using a total organic carbon analyzer toc l shimadzu japan to determine the doc level prior to the test all algal water samples were diluted to a desired doc concentration before each test 2 2 oxidation protocol oxidation as a preliminary test was carried out to determine the optimum oxidation strategy to improve algae removal at a desired ratio of oxidant dosage and doc level using a standard jar test phipps and bird usa bulk algae suspension was diluted to concentration of 3 mg l as doc and adjusted to ph 8 5 0 1 additionally the addition of sodium perchlorate naclo4 and sodium bicarbonate nahco3 are important to maintain alkalinity at 10 2 m for background ionic strength and basicity respectively following the method in taiwan s dwtp oxidation was carried out by applying naocl and doc in the ratio of 1 1 cl2 doc with the decided concentration of naocl is 3 mg l as cl2 various mixing times were determined starting from 0 2 4 6 8 10 and 12 min at 200 rpm the suspensions were immediately withdrawn at each mixing time to determine their residual cell count and viability of cells the number of cells and cell viability were measured by luna fl automated fluorescence cell counter logos south korea containing bright field and dual fluorescence optics that automatically counts the cells the luna fl automatically measures the number as well as the viability of cells with sophisticated optical components and advanced image analysis algorithms by mixed cell samples and acridine orange propidium iodide ao pi stain into a photonslide morphological analysis was also used to investigate the effects of oxidant ability on cell morphology using a standard light microscope axiostar microscope zeiss usa fluorescence excitation emission matrix f eem was used to determine the effect of oxidant on the chemical composition of organic matter using fluorescence spectrophotometer fluorescence spectroscopy shimadzu rf 6000 japan for each test all samples were anlayzed in duplicate 2 3 oxidation assisted coagulation protocol the experiments were carried out using a standard jar test phipps and bird usa after deciding the optimal time for the oxidation process by the preliminary test naocl was added as an oxidizing agent with various dosages at 1 1 and 3 1 cl2 doc into ma suspension samples at 200 rpm for 2 min mixing time optimal condition all samples were adjusted to doc of 1 mg l before starting the treatment to investigate the effects of low cl2 doc 1 1 and high cl2 doc 3 1 chlorine dosages on coagulation performance the use of various chlorine dosages is to investigate how naocl oxidation promotes or affects coagulation and algae removal at different pacl concentrations immediately post oxidation the sample was taken out for subsequent analysis including doc to calculate the comparison value of doc after treatment and initial doc concentration by obtaining the percentage of doc release following the formula 1 d o

of oxidation pacl c chung hwa chemical industrial works used in this study contains 37 monomeric al ala 13 polymeric al alb and 50 colloidal al alc 17 pacl of 1 mg l 2 mg l and 3 mg l as al were dosed after oxidation test followed by 2 mins rapid mixing at 200 rpm 20 mins slow mixing at 30 rpm and sedimentation for 20 min to understand the floc growth process during oxidation assisted coagulation floc formation analysis was carried out to determine the average diameter and fractal dimension of formed flocs the floc sizes formed by pacl coagulation were expressed as an equivalent volumetric diameter and d50 were used as an indicator of average floc size the supernatant was collected after sedimentation for floc analysis using jar floccam specifically the average floc diameter using the formula 3 a v g f l o c d i a m e t e r 1 n σ i 1 n d i fractal dimension fd as a parameter to identify the formation of the fractal shaped floc based on flocs area and circumferences as used in a previous study 17 both measured automatically by the floccam software 2 4 characterization of aom fraction fluorescence excitation emission matrix f eem is a method to analyze the aom fraction changes after treatment using fluorescence spectrophotometer rf 6000 fluorescence spectroscopy shimadzu japan samples were analyzed using eem spectra with subsequent scanning excitation ex wavelength range from 200 500 nm with 10 nm increments and the emission em spectra in the range from 250 550 nm with 5 nm increments for each test of samples were subjected to four specific regions with excitation emission wavelength ex em of 250 340 280 380 250 400 380 550 200 250 380 550 and 200 250 280 380 nm representing soluble microbial products like smpl region i humic acid like hal region ii fulvic acid like fal region iii and aromatic protein like apl region iv substances respectively also calculated the average fluorescence intensities afis a u for each substance category 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of oxidation on ma cells removal and fluorescent dissolved organic matter in preliminary oxidation experiments oxidation at different contact times was investigated to determine the optimum oxidation condition at the desired ratio of oxidant dosage and doc level fig 1 shows the effect of mixing time on algae removal at a given chlorine dosage cl2 doc 1 1 as shown in fig 1a algae density drops from approximately 1 10 106 to 0 35 106 cells ml with increasing contact time from 2 to 12 min while it shows a dramatic increase to 1 4 106 for 2 min contact time however cell concentration measured in od680 shows the difference whereby decreases in od680 constantly occur overtime before the chlorophyll of the ma suspension is significantly removed at 2 min oxidation then it reaches a stable level but the total cell count retains a high level to elucidate the impact of oxidation time on algae removal algal cell viability was measured and illustrated in fig 1b cell viability is reduced to a minimum from 2 min to 4 min around 40 9 30 4 but dramatically increased to 96 with increasing mixing time as investigated by a previous study effective oxidation that is able to reduce algal cell count while limiting its effects towards cell viability is a crucial step for upgrading the performance of coagulation sedimentation 25 an increase in viability is suspected from the disintegration of algae cells while the remaining living cells can still be observed in this study naocl oxidation at 2 min of contact time would improve algae cell removal with lesser disintegration of cells in coagulation changes in algal cell viability after oxidation could be related to the contents of dissolved organic matter dom in algae laden water 26 after oxidation at various contact times dom composition is shown in fig 2 with afi changes of four individual dom fig 2 shows a significant increase in total afi at 2 min contact time before going stagnant over time humic acid like hal and fulvic acid like fal substances are the dominant dom component before and after oxidation this could be attributed to the aromatic components as the primary active sites attacked by an oxidant such as chlorine 27 the afi ratio of aromatic protein like apl and soluble microbial product like smpl substances decreased slightly after naocl oxidation indicating that the apl and smpl substances are susceptible to naocl oxidation thus it is suggested that the apl and smpl substances preferentially react with naocl oxidation than hal and fal substances furthermore the increase of hal and fal in the dom pool can signify the release of aom which may indirectly affect algae destabilization by coagulation a previous study has reported that hal and fal are predominantly substances contained in eom 28 while the iom may compose apl substances majorly 29 30 in this study the release of hal and fal shows the effect of naocl on algal cell morphology which results in the cell membrane s extensive damage as the cell size changes after exposure to chlorine furthermore although hal and fal substances release after exposure to naocl with a dosage ratio of 1 1 cl2 doc at a contact time of 2 min cell morphology shows minimum damage to cells compared with mixing time at 12 min fig s2 therefore the contact time of 2 min was determined for subsequent oxidation with a majority of algal aggregates are expected to be formed post coagulation flocculation with fewer ruptured cells 3 2 effect of oxidation assisted coagulation on ma cells removal the comparison between various naocl oxidant dosages with different pacl dosages on ma cell removal was investigated fig 3 shows the ma algae removal rate is increased as increasing pacl dosage at low and high chlorine dosing ratio cl2 doc 3 1 in oxidation coagulation after pacl coagulation at a low chlorine dosing ratio cl2 doc 1 1 the increase in algae removal rate by pacl coagulation is substantially enhanced with the increased coagulant dosage however at a high chlorine dosing ratio cl2 doc 3 1 effective algae removal rate around 84 occurs even without coagulation treatment the highest algae cell removal around 99 47 is achieved at the 3 mg l of pacl dosage high chlorine dosing ratio cl2 doc 3 1 shows a better ma algae removal than low chlorine dosing ratio cl2 doc 1 1 in oxidation assisted coagulation efficient algae removal occurs due to the additional effect of free chlorine at high dose reaction with algal cells leading to the further disintegration of algae cells however increased pacl coagulant dosage is able to improve algal removal further by sweep flocculation because of the majority of colloidal al 31 these results are supported by cell morphology observations as shown in fig s3 illustrating smaller ma cells after oxidation this finding indicates that naocl oxidation plays the dominant role in algae removal compared to pacl coagulation 3 3 effect of oxidation assisted coagulation on dissolved organic matter reduction fig 4 shows the doc and suva value of ma suspensions through the oxidation assisted coagulation by various chlorine dosages the doc concentration increases around 176 1 and 332 5 at low and high chlorine dosing ratio respectively furthermore the doc concentration still increases during the coagulation process it is similar to a previous study which has confirmed that the doc concentration keeps increasing during oxidation assisted coagulation 32 it implies that free chlorine continuously reacts with disintegrating the ma cells and facilitate the iom release resulting in the increased doc level on the other hand the suva value shows a gradual decrease with the increased coagulant dosage where it reduces to 0 1126 and 0 0785 l mg m at low cl2 doc 1 1 and high chlorine dosing ratio cl2 doc 3 1 respectively it implies that the existence of non aromatic and hydrophilic remains in the algal removal process the decreased suva occurs after oxidation leads the ma suspension to transform into more hydrophilic the suva values obtained with less than two indicate that the majority of hydrophilic molecule dissolved organic matter are contained in treated water suva 2 l mg m 33 which increases the difficulty of aom destabilization for coagulation compared to hydrophobic organics 12 34 35 the fluorescent spectra of filtered algae suspension were further studied to characterize the aom fraction in terms of afi fig 5 shows the smpl substances are dominant in dom oxidation at a low chlorine dosing ratio cl2 doc 1 1 significantly degrades the smpl and apl substances in contrast there was a significant increase in hal substances and slightly increased fal substances after oxidation assisted coagulation resulting from aom release a similar trend is observed for four fluorescent organic substances at a high chlorine dosing ratio cl2 doc 3 1 with more afi intensity impacts the release of aom from algal cells due to oxidant induced stress or even cell lysis increases the doc level in ma suspension and then increases the disinfection by product dbp precursors 36 this critical finding indicates that naocl effectively degrades the smpl and apl substances to be more hydrophilic with the decreased suva value fig 4 however naocl oxidation is ineffective in degrading the hal and apl substances pacl coagulation is ineffective in destabilizing the released aom in ma algae suspension it could be attributed to the release of aom at high concentration decreases the surface charge of algal particles which may inhibit coagulation and increasing coagulant demand 6 12 3 4 effect of oxidation assisted coagulation on ma floc formation the oxidation effect on floc growth during pacl coagulation is shown in fig 6 floc formation is insignificant at low and high chlorine dosing ratio with the coagulant dosage as low as 1 mg l as al by contrast increasing pacl dosage further to 2 mg l as al under low chlorine dosing ratio cl2 doc 1 1 floc formation becomes faster and larger during coagulation in addition the floc growth curve after oxidation at high dosage cl2 doc 3 1 exhibits similar growth trends with a smaller diameter the algae aggregation induced by pacl coagulation at a low chlorine dosing ratio cl2 doc 1 1 leads to the bigger flocs compared to high chlorine dosing ratio cl2 doc 3 1 it can be attributed to aom release at a high chlorine dosing ratio which effectively influences algae destabilization and coagulation demand a study has confirmed that intracellular organic matter with a negative charge can consume more coagulants 37 and resulted in smaller flocs 38 on the other hand the bigger original algae cells with less lysis induced at a low chlorine dosing ratio cl2 doc 1 1 could provide a much higher contact frequency between cells during flocculation which is benefit to form larger flocs the fractal dimension of floc was further studied to investigate the effect of oxidant dosing on floc compactness in coagulation as shown in table 1 the fractal dimension increases as coagulant dosage increase for both oxidant dosing conditions the highest floc compactness is obtained at a coagulant dosage of 2 mg l as al low chlorine dosing ratio cl2 doc 1 1 promotes the floc with lower compactness in contrast high chlorine dosing ratio cl2 doc 3 1 results in a higher fractal dimension the flocs with a high fractal dimension can accelerate their settling velocity by gravity for effective particle removal 39 the results have shown that the addition of high oxidant dosage before the coagulation impairs the floc formation 4 conclusion naocl oxidation assisted pacl coagulation for the destabilization of microcystis aeruginosa cells is significantly influenced by the aom fraction changes during naocl oxidation naocl oxidation combined with pacl coagulation fails to remove dom resulting from aom released in the water the increases in humic acid like hal and fulvic acid like fal substances indicate that algae cells are affected by free chlorine reaction which causes increases in aom however naocl coupled with pacl is sufficient to degrade soluble microbial product like smpl and aromatic protein like apl substances increased chorine dosage plays a more significant role in algae removal than increasing coagulant dosage the smaller flocs formed by pacl coagulation coupled with chlorination could be attributed to the higher released aom it is first found that the change in fluorescent organic matter fraction during chlorination dominantly affects coagulation performance for aom removal to improve ma cell removal and minimize the aom release it is necessary to add enough chlorine at optimal pacl coagulant dosage to reduce the aom release and keep effective ma cell removal in drinking water treatment which facilitates lower dbp formation potential in post chlorination credit authorship contribution statement jr lin lin conceptualization resources funding acquisition visualization

coagulation has been widely applied to destabilize algae and improve algae removal through a flocculation sedimentation process in drinking water treatment plants dwtps however oxidation poses a potential threat to drinking water safety with increasing algal organic matter aom in the algae polluted surface water this study investigated the effect of sodium hypochlorite naocl oxidation assisted polyaluminum chloride pacl coagulation on algae removal along with the identification of the optical properties for aom fractions the results have demonstrated that the increased naocl oxidant dose coupled with pacl coagulation induced by sweep flocculation is more effective in microcystis aeruginosa ma cells destabilization and removal where the highest algae removal rate around 99 however naocl oxidation coupled with pacl coagulation fails to reduce the dissolved organic carbon doc in ma suspension attributed to the released aom strong free chlorine destroys ma cells in response to the increases in humic acid like hal and fulvic acid like fal substances while it is sufficient to degrade soluble microbial product like smpl and aromatic protein like apl substances in oxidation assisted coagulation bigger diameter 483 640 μm with lower fractal dimension 1 31 1 39 of m aeruginosa flocs are formed at low chlorine dosing ratio cl2 doc 1 1 while higher fractal dimension 2 39 2 75 with smaller diameter 143 395 μm is reached at high chlorine dosing ratio cl2 doc 3 1 it is concluded that the changes in fluorescent organic matter fraction during chlorination dominantly affect coagulation performance for aom removal in oxidation coagulation process keywords water treatment oxidation coagulation algogenic organic matter al hydrates 1 introduction eutrophication of surface water is a worldwide environmental problem with negative impacts on aquatic ecosystems the presence of excessive nutrients usually causes eutrophication to stimulate algae growth 1 such as microcystis aeruginosa as one of the most dominant cyanobacteria species in warm shallow and nutrition rich water bodies 2 when algal blooms occur in aquatic ecosystems the conventional water treatments are unable to deal with increased cell concentration especially with an increase in algal organic matter aom 3 algae produce aom in response to stressful conditions such as low nutrient concentrations absence of light low ph and extreme temperature changes 4 aom mainly classified as extracellular organic matter eom which is formed outside the cell deriving from metabolic excretion and intracellular organic matter iom which is secreted via intracellular autolysis 5 generally both eom and iom originated from the algal cell that can be a significant part of natural organic matter nom in the algae laden water body 6 the cyanobacteria such as microcystis aeruginosa ma commonly exist in drinking water reservoirs ma has been proven that its metabolism in drinking water is toxic to human beings caused by intracellular toxin release 7 therefore it is essential to remove harmful algae from water for drinking water plants dwtps oxidation has been widely used to enhance algae removal by coagulation and sedimentation processes in drinking water treatment 8 the chemical of oxidant can improve algae coagulation by inactivating algal cells destabilizing of algal cells and fragments or liberating extracellular organic matter eom 9 sodium hypochlorite naocl is commonly used as chlorine based disinfectants for algae laden water oxidation because it has a strong ability to improve algal removal by algal inactivation effect during pre treatment 10 furthermore overdosing of chlorine can influence the cell integrity 11 or damage algal cells by the diffusion of hocl and ocl at neutral ph to rupture the cell and induced aom released 12 therefore oxidation strategies such as dosage and mixing time should be considered to improve algal cell removal efficiency after a coagulation sedimentation process in dwtps as a critical step of algal removal increasing the coagulant dose may reduce the adverse effects of aom to some extent aom at low concentration was reported to act as an inter particle bridge to facilitate the removal of particles 13 in contrast aom at a high level can affect coagulation and increased coagulant demand to destabilized algae cells 12 furthermore the aom coagulant complexes formation could impede coagulant hydrolysis 14 polyaluminum chloride pacl has been commonly used as a pre hydrolyzed coagulant its al species distribution strongly affects the efficiency of organic matter destabilization and particle aggregation rate in drinking water treatment 15 commercial pacl species coagulant distribution is generally described as a monomer ala polymer alb or colloidal al alc the coagulation performance in water treatment is known to be subjected to hydrolyzed al species 14 prestudies have indicated that pre hydrolyzed colloidal al alc plays an important role in particle destabilization for effective floc formation by enhanced sweep coagulation 15 18 in algae laden water treatment by coagulation hydrolyzed al species composition is dominant for algae rich water treatment 19 in practice microalgae are light and their cellular metabolisms are more hydrophilic resulting in insufficient coagulation for aom removal in dwtps thus it is crucial to forming large and compact floc in response to fast solid liquid separation for algae laden water treatment by coagulation with al hydrates many studies have investigated the effect of chlorination on cell integrity and aom release from algal cells and their impacts on pacl coagulation for algae destabilization 10 12 20 however limited studies have investigated the effect of oxidation assisted coagulation on aom release and degradation and the effect of its fraction changes on organic matter destabilization with al hydrates and the minimization of ma algae the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of oxidation assisted coagulation on algae removal and aom fraction changes by determining the optimal oxidation strategy to achieve effective aom removal by pacl coagulation sedimentation 2 materials and methods 2 1 algae cultivation freshwater cyanobacteria microcystis aeruginosa ma were taken from the drinking water reservoir of matsu island taiwan it was purified before culturing and then cultured in several 500 ml flasks containing bg 11 sterilized algal growth media following a previous study 21 algal cultures were housed in a continuous automated flask shaker at room temperature 25 c 1 c and provided with tl5 lamps of illumination on 16 h light 8 h dark cycle 22 the growth conditions were measured periodically every four days with analysis of total cells using luna fl automated fluorescence cell counter logos south korea together with cell viability measurement to quantify the number of living and dead cells during algal cell cultivation the ma cells were harvested in the exponential phases fig s1 when the solution stock has reached around 1 107 cells ml optical density od measurement was investigated using spectrophotometer by chlorophyll a content measurement 23 with the absorbance of chlorophyll a existing in all microalgae about 680 nm 24 the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration in the solution was measured using a total organic carbon analyzer toc l shimadzu japan to determine the doc level prior to the test all algal water samples were diluted to a desired doc concentration before each test 2 2 oxidation protocol oxidation as a preliminary test was carried out to determine the optimum oxidation strategy to improve algae removal at a desired ratio of oxidant dosage and doc level using a standard jar test phipps and bird usa bulk algae suspension was diluted to concentration of 3 mg l as doc and adjusted to ph 8 5 0 1 additionally the addition of sodium perchlorate naclo4 and sodium bicarbonate nahco3 are important to maintain alkalinity at 10 2 m for background ionic strength and basicity respectively following the method in taiwan s dwtp oxidation was carried out by applying naocl and doc in the ratio of 1 1 cl2 doc with the decided concentration of naocl is 3 mg l as cl2 various mixing times were determined starting from 0 2 4 6 8 10 and 12 min at 200 rpm the suspensions were immediately withdrawn at each mixing time to determine their residual cell count and viability of cells the number of cells and cell viability were measured by luna fl automated fluorescence cell counter logos south korea containing bright field and dual fluorescence optics that automatically counts the cells the luna fl automatically measures the number as well as the viability of cells with sophisticated optical components and advanced image analysis algorithms by mixed cell samples and acridine orange propidium iodide ao pi stain into a photonslide morphological analysis was also used to investigate the effects of oxidant ability on cell morphology using a standard light microscope axiostar microscope zeiss usa fluorescence excitation emission matrix f eem was used to determine the effect of oxidant on the chemical composition of organic matter using fluorescence spectrophotometer fluorescence spectroscopy shimadzu rf 6000 japan for each test all samples were anlayzed in duplicate 2 3 oxidation assisted coagulation protocol the experiments were carried out using a standard jar test phipps and bird usa after deciding the optimal time for the oxidation process by the preliminary test naocl was added as an oxidizing agent with various dosages at 1 1 and 3 1 cl2 doc into ma suspension samples at 200 rpm for 2 min mixing time optimal condition all samples were adjusted to doc of 1 mg l before starting the treatment to investigate the effects of low cl2 doc 1 1 and high cl2 doc 3 1 chlorine dosages on coagulation performance the use of various chlorine dosages is to investigate how naocl oxidation promotes or affects coagulation and algae removal at different pacl concentrations immediately post oxidation the sample was taken out for subsequent analysis including doc to calculate the comparison value of doc after treatment and initial doc concentration by obtaining the percentage of doc release following the formula 1 d o

organic matter and the aromatics chromophores presence was measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer genesys 10s thermo scientific usa uv254 was used to get the specific ultraviolet absorbance suva that can further explain the aromaticity and or hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of organic matter by dividing uv254 value by doc value other than that the suva reduction rate was determined by the

as doc was measured using a total organic carbon analyzer toc l cph cpn shimadzu japan for the enhanced coagulation process pacl coagulant was added into the solution immediately after the completion of oxidation pacl c chung hwa chemical industrial works used in this study contains 37 monomeric al ala 13 polymeric al alb and 50 colloidal al alc 17 pacl of 1 mg l 2 mg l and 3 mg l as al were dosed after oxidation test followed by 2 mins rapid mixing at 200 rpm 20 mins slow mixing at 30 rpm and sedimentation for 20 min to understand the floc growth process during oxidation assisted coagulation floc formation analysis was carried out to determine the average diameter and fractal dimension of formed flocs the floc sizes formed by pacl coagulation were expressed as an equivalent volumetric diameter and d50 were used as an indicator of average floc size the supernatant was collected after sedimentation for floc analysis using jar floccam specifically the average floc diameter using the formula 3 a v g f l o c d i a m e t e r 1 n σ i 1 n d i fractal dimension fd as a parameter to identify the formation of the fractal shaped floc based on flocs area and circumferences as used in a previous study 17 both measured automatically by the floccam software 2 4 characterization of aom fraction fluorescence excitation emission matrix f eem is a method to analyze the aom fraction changes after treatment using fluorescence spectrophotometer rf 6000 fluorescence spectroscopy shimadzu japan samples were analyzed using eem spectra with subsequent scanning excitation ex wavelength range

emission wavelength ex em of 250 340 280 380 250 400 380 550 200 250 380 550 and 200 250 280 380 nm representing soluble microbial products like smpl region i humic acid like hal region ii fulvic acid like fal region iii and aromatic protein like apl region iv substances respectively also calculated the average fluorescence intensities afis a u for each substance category 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of oxidation on ma cells removal and fluorescent dissolved organic matter in preliminary oxidation experiments oxidation at different contact times was investigated to determine the optimum oxidation condition at the desired ratio of oxidant dosage and doc level fig 1 shows the effect of mixing time on algae removal at a given chlorine dosage cl2 doc 1 1 as shown in fig 1a algae density drops from approximately 1 10 106 to 0 35 106 cells ml with increasing contact time from 2 to 12 min while it shows a dramatic increase to 1 4 106 for 2 min contact time however cell concentration measured in od680 shows the difference whereby decreases in od680 constantly occur overtime before the chlorophyll of the ma suspension is significantly removed at 2 min oxidation then it reaches a stable level but the total cell count retains a high level to elucidate the impact of oxidation time on algae removal algal cell viability was measured and illustrated in fig 1b cell viability is reduced to a minimum from 2 min to 4 min around 40 9 30 4 but dramatically increased to 96 with increasing mixing time as investigated by a previous study effective oxidation that is able to reduce algal cell count while limiting its effects towards cell viability is a crucial step for upgrading the performance of coagulation sedimentation 25 an increase in viability is suspected from the disintegration of algae cells while the remaining living cells can still be observed in this study naocl oxidation at 2 min of contact time would improve algae cell removal with lesser disintegration of cells in coagulation changes in algal cell viability after oxidation could be related to the contents of dissolved organic matter dom in algae laden water 26 after oxidation at various contact times dom composition is shown in fig 2 with afi changes of four individual dom fig 2 shows a significant increase in total afi at 2 min contact time before going stagnant over time humic acid like hal and fulvic acid like fal substances are the dominant dom component before and after oxidation this could be attributed to the aromatic components as the primary active sites attacked by an oxidant such as chlorine 27 the afi ratio of aromatic protein like apl and soluble microbial product like smpl substances decreased slightly after naocl oxidation indicating that the apl and smpl substances are susceptible to naocl oxidation thus it is suggested that the apl and smpl substances preferentially react with naocl oxidation than hal and fal substances furthermore the increase of hal and fal in the dom pool can signify the release of aom which may indirectly affect algae destabilization by coagulation a previous study has reported that hal and fal are predominantly substances contained in eom 28 while the iom may compose apl substances majorly 29 30 in this study the release of hal and fal shows the effect of naocl on algal cell morphology which results in the cell membrane s extensive damage as the cell size changes after exposure to chlorine furthermore although hal and fal substances release after exposure to naocl with a dosage ratio of 1 1 cl2 doc at a contact time of 2 min cell morphology shows minimum damage to cells compared with mixing time at 12 min fig s2 therefore the contact time of 2 min was determined for subsequent oxidation with a majority of algal aggregates are expected to be formed post coagulation flocculation with fewer ruptured cells 3 2 effect of oxidation assisted coagulation on ma cells removal the comparison between various naocl oxidant dosages with different pacl dosages on ma cell removal was investigated fig 3 shows the ma algae removal rate is increased as increasing pacl dosage at low and high chlorine dosing ratio cl2 doc 3 1 in oxidation coagulation after pacl coagulation at a low chlorine dosing ratio cl2 doc 1 1 the increase in algae removal rate by pacl coagulation is substantially enhanced with the increased coagulant dosage however at a high chlorine dosing ratio cl2 doc 3 1 effective algae removal rate around 84 occurs even without coagulation treatment the highest algae cell removal around 99 47 is achieved at the 3 mg l of pacl dosage high chlorine dosing ratio cl2 doc 3 1 shows a better ma algae removal than low chlorine dosing ratio cl2 doc 1 1 in oxidation assisted coagulation efficient algae removal occurs due to the additional effect of free chlorine at high dose reaction with algal cells leading to the further disintegration of algae cells however increased pacl coagulant dosage is able to improve algal removal further by sweep flocculation because of the majority of colloidal al 31 these results are supported by cell morphology observations as shown in fig s3 illustrating smaller ma cells after oxidation this finding indicates that naocl oxidation plays the dominant role in algae removal compared to pacl coagulation 3 3 effect of oxidation assisted coagulation on dissolved organic matter reduction fig 4 shows the doc and suva value of ma suspensions through the oxidation assisted coagulation by various chlorine dosages the doc concentration increases around 176 1 and 332 5 at low and high chlorine dosing ratio respectively furthermore the doc concentration still increases during the coagulation process it is similar to a previous study which has confirmed that the doc concentration keeps increasing during oxidation assisted coagulation 32 it implies that free chlorine continuously reacts with disintegrating the ma cells and facilitate the iom release resulting in the increased doc level on the other hand the suva value shows a gradual decrease with the increased coagulant dosage where it reduces to 0 1126 and 0 0785 l mg m at low cl2 doc 1 1 and high chlorine dosing ratio cl2 doc 3 1 respectively it implies that the existence of non aromatic and hydrophilic remains in the algal removal process the decreased suva occurs after oxidation leads the ma suspension to transform into more hydrophilic the suva values obtained with less than two indicate that the majority of hydrophilic molecule dissolved organic matter are contained in treated water suva 2 l mg m 33 which increases the difficulty of aom destabilization for coagulation compared to hydrophobic organics 12 34 35 the fluorescent spectra of filtered algae suspension were further studied to characterize the aom fraction in terms of afi fig 5 shows the smpl substances are dominant in dom oxidation at a low chlorine dosing ratio cl2 doc 1 1 significantly degrades the smpl and apl substances in contrast there was a significant increase in hal substances and slightly increased fal substances after oxidation assisted coagulation resulting from aom release a similar trend is observed for four fluorescent organic substances at a high chlorine dosing ratio cl2 doc 3 1 with more afi intensity impacts the release of aom from algal cells due to oxidant induced stress or even cell lysis increases the doc level in ma suspension and then increases the disinfection by product dbp precursors 36 this critical finding indicates that naocl effectively degrades the smpl and apl substances to be more hydrophilic with the decreased suva value fig 4 however naocl oxidation is ineffective in degrading the hal and apl substances pacl coagulation is ineffective in destabilizing the released aom in ma algae suspension it could be attributed to the release of aom at high concentration decreases the surface charge of algal particles which may inhibit coagulation and increasing coagulant demand 6 12 3 4 effect of oxidation assisted coagulation on ma floc formation the oxidation effect on floc growth during pacl coagulation is shown in fig 6 floc formation is insignificant at low and high chlorine dosing ratio with the coagulant dosage as low as 1 mg l as al by contrast increasing pacl dosage further to 2 mg l as al under low chlorine dosing ratio cl2 doc 1 1 floc formation becomes faster and larger during coagulation in addition the floc growth curve after oxidation at high dosage cl2 doc 3 1 exhibits similar growth trends with a smaller diameter the algae aggregation induced by pacl coagulation at a low chlorine dosing ratio cl2 doc 1 1 leads to the bigger flocs compared to high chlorine dosing ratio cl2 doc 3 1 it can be attributed to aom release at a high chlorine dosing ratio which effectively influences algae destabilization and coagulation demand a study has confirmed that intracellular organic matter with a negative charge can consume more coagulants 37 and resulted in smaller flocs 38 on the other hand the bigger original algae cells with less lysis induced at a low chlorine dosing ratio cl2 doc 1 1 could provide a much higher contact frequency between cells during flocculation which is benefit to form larger flocs the fractal dimension of floc was further studied to investigate the effect of oxidant dosing on floc compactness in coagulation as shown in table 1 the fractal dimension increases as coagulant dosage increase for both oxidant dosing conditions the highest floc compactness is obtained at a coagulant dosage of 2 mg l as al low chlorine dosing ratio cl2 doc 1 1 promotes the floc with lower compactness in contrast high chlorine dosing ratio cl2 doc 3 1 results in a higher fractal dimension the flocs with a high fractal dimension can accelerate their settling velocity by gravity for effective particle removal 39 the results have shown that the addition of high oxidant dosage before the coagulation impairs the floc formation 4 conclusion naocl oxidation assisted pacl coagulation for the destabilization of microcystis aeruginosa cells is significantly influenced by the aom fraction changes during naocl oxidation naocl oxidation combined with pacl coagulation fails to remove dom resulting from aom released in the water the increases in humic acid like hal and fulvic acid like fal substances indicate that algae cells are affected by free chlorine reaction which causes increases in aom however naocl coupled with pacl is sufficient to degrade soluble microbial product like smpl and aromatic protein like apl substances increased chorine dosage plays a more significant role in algae removal than increasing coagulant dosage the smaller flocs formed by pacl coagulation coupled with chlorination could be attributed to the higher released aom it is first found that the change in fluorescent organic matter fraction during chlorination dominantly affects coagulation performance for aom removal to improve ma cell removal and minimize the aom release it is necessary to add enough chlorine at optimal pacl coagulant dosage to reduce the aom release and keep effective ma cell removal in drinking water treatment which facilitates lower dbp formation potential in post chlorination credit authorship contribution statement jr lin lin conceptualization resources funding acquisition visualization

13447,maximizing production and use of n2o produced by the process of denitrification has emerged as a promising concept for energy recovery from nitrogen acetylene is well known as an inhibitor of n2o reductase activity however to date few studies have utilized long term cultivation with acetylene to achieve denitrifying n2o recovery this work assessed the performance of n2o production and shifts in the denitrifying community in response to long term exposure of acetylene during nitrite denitrification batch tests showed that long term exposure to acetylene at high concentrations volume fraction 40 resulted in high n2o accumulation up to 98 6 high throughput 16s rrna gene analysis suggested that saprospiraceae dominated the microbial community at the end of the cultivation period with its abundance increasing from the initial 3 2 to 42 2 metagenomic analysis revealed that after the long term cultivation under high level acetylene the relative abundance of nosz in the community did not change significantly instead the noszⅱ harboring bacteria became dominant batch tests in series demonstrated that n2o reduction could be restored rapidly upon removal of acetylene this study describes an effective method for high yield production of n2o during nitrite denitrification that can be used to enhance energy recovery and improves our understanding of the long term effect of acetylene on the denitrifying community keywords n2o recovery denitrification acetylene denitrifying community metagenomics 1 introduction n2o is well known as a potent greenhouse gas 1 2 which can also result in the destruction of stratospheric ozone 3 4 in addition to the environmentally harmful impacts n2o has been recently proposed as a sustainable energy source 5 6 if properly captured considerable energy can be generated when n2o is utilized as strong oxidizing agent in combustion reactions 7 8 compared with the stoichiometric combustion of 1 mol of ch4 with o2 roughly 30 more energy is produced via combustion of equivalent ch4 with n2o 9 n2o has also been used as a fuel additive in rocket propellants and motor racing in order to improve the power output of engines 10 11 therefore achieving efficient recovery of n2o in the wastewater treatment systems has significant environmental and energy benefits 12 it can not only reduce the greenhouse effect but also realize the bioenergy recovery of nitrogen contaminated wastewater nitrogen removal is a major goal in both municipal and industrial wastewater biological treatment systems 13 15 during nitrogen removal abiotic mechanisms for generating n2o are possible 16 for example the reaction of nitrite with ferrous iron to form no which can then further react with ferrous iron to form n2o 17 18 however it is worth noting that the high dosage of ferrous iron required for this method of n2o production not only results in expensive operational costs but also creates waste sludge with hazardous levels of iron 11 microbial denitrification is a more feasible alternative and the one contributing the most to global n2o bioproduction 19 20 to lessen energy costs and maximize energy generation there has been extensive interest in shortening the traditional process of nitrification i e nh4 no2 no3 and denitrification i e no3 no2 no n2o n2 with nitrite as the bridge and link during nitrogen removal 21 23 hence nitrogen removal coupled to n2o recovery during the nitrite denitrification process is potentially a promising approach for the energy production 24 25 the coupled aerobic anoxic nitrous decomposition operation cando process is representative of this approach 16 during this n removal process alternating acetate and nitrite pulses cause cells to store intracellular polyhydroxybutyrate phb as the source of electrons in denitrification and this results in reduction of reactive no2 to n2o 26 cando has been reported to achieve efficient and stable denitrifier based n2o production ratios of about 65 80 9 this is a significant improvement in n2o production over conventional nitrogen bioremoval processes however the complex operation required for supplying carbon and nitrite by turns restricts the implementation of cando in practice since a majority of wastewaters will contain both consequently new techniques of n2o production applied to wastewater with c and n coexisting need to be developed nitrite denitrification from no2 to n2 involves three reduction steps containing nitrite reductase nir nitric oxide reductase nor and nitrous oxide reductase nos with no and n2o as intermediates 27 28 referring to the denitrifying electron transfer chain preventing the biological reduction of n2o to n2 is essential for achieving high n2o product yields 12 29 previous work has shown that various environmental factors e g free nitrous acid fna 30 low ph 20 moderate do exposure 31 32 and low cod n 33 34 all have a positive effect on n2o production from denitrification 35 acetylene is an additional well known compound that is used as a bioassay inhibitor of n2o reductase to allow estimation of short term denitrification fluxes in some natural ecosystems 36 38 based on the previous studies describing acetylene inhibition the presence of acetylene in the range of 1 10 caused complete or almost complete inhibition of n2o reduction by pure and mixed suspensions of denitrifying cells 38 39 nosz lacking denitrifiers have been shown to be common in some environments 40 we hypothesized the presence of acetylene might lead to a decrease of nosz in the community since it no longer provides a selectable benefit it has been shown that communities enriched for this type of truncation produce higher levels of n2o 41 however it is also possible that nosz occurrence in the community may not change as the gene has been found in environments that produce n2o as dominant end product 42 the aims of this study were to observe the impact of prolonged acetylene cultivation on an activated sludge system with a particular focus on n2o production during nitrite denitrification as a broad gauge of the impact of acetylene high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing was adopted to assess changes in the bacterial community metagenomics was used to explore the functional community shifts including those impacting the key noszi and noszii gene clades this study will allow better understanding of the response of denitrifying communities to the long term presence of acetylene which can provide fundamental knowledge for further engineering development and application of denitrification based and acetylene derived high yield n2o recovery processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor operation three reactors of 250 ml designated r0 r1 and r2 with identical working volumes of 200 ml were operated in sequencing batch mode for 130 days the initial volatile suspended solids vss concentrations in the reactors was 3 7 g l 1 and the inoculation sludge was taken from the changqiao municipal wastewater treatment plant shanghai china the operation conditions of reactors were as follows synthetic wastewater hydraulic retention time of 12 h mixed speed of 120 rpm a temperature of 30 and initial ph of 7 0 0 1 at the beginning of each cycle 0 5 and 20 ml air were extracted from the headspace of the three airtight reactors r0 r1 and r2 respectively and the corresponding volumes of acetylene were injected in reactors to achieve the acetylene concentrations of 0 10 and 40 v v the reactors were fed a stock solution of sodium nitrite and sodium acetate nitrite n 50 mg l 1 cod 200 mg l 1 the mineral medium excluding c and n source is described in the si 2 2 biomass performance monitoring batch tests to determine n2o production efficiency of the extracted biomass were carried out every 10 days in triplicate serum bottles 120 ml placed in an shaking table 120 rpm at 30 without acetylene 20 ml of activated sludge was taken from r0 r1 and r2 respectively and washed with distilled water three times for the test both pretreated sludge and 70 ml of mineral medium were added to the serum bottles to obtain an initial concentration of 1 8 g vss l 1 1 m hcl or 1 m naoh was supplied to adjust the initial ph to 7 0 0 1 nitrogen aeration at 250 ml min 1 for 5 min was supplied to remove do and residual acetylene in the system the serum bottles were then immediately sealed with rubber plugs and aluminum caps 50 mg l 1 nitrite n and 200 mg l 1 cod were provided at the initial stage of each batch test batch tests in series were also carried out without acetylene to determine the acetylene durability on n2o production using the activated sludge from r2 other experimental conditions were the same as the batch tests described above in addition once the 50 mg l 1 nitrite n was completely reduced the same amount of nitrite was added again to allow the batch tests to be conducted in series 2 3 analytical methods at regular intervals the mixed liquid in the batch tests were sampled for analysis of nh4 no3 no2 and cod at the same time the headspace of the serum bottle was sampled for the analysis of n2o liquor samples were collected by a syringe and filtered through disposable millipore filter units 0 22 μm pore size at once the concentrations of nh4 no3 and no2 were measured according to standard methods 43 sodium acetate were measured on a shimadzu gc2014c gas chromatograph with flame ionization detector and an hp innowax column n2o concentrations in the headspace were determined on a shimadzu gc2014c gas chromatograph with a porapak q column and flame ionization detector 25 the method for determination of n2o concentrations is described in the si 2 4 amplicon sequencing for 16s rrna gene community structure was monitored over time via high throughput amplicon dna sequencing of 16s rrna gene fragments genomic dna was extracted from inoculum sludge and from the sludge samples of r0 r1 and r2 at 10 50 90 and 130 days according to the manufacturer s protocol of fastdna spin kit shenergy biocolor china the v3 and v4 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified by universal bacterial primers 338f and 806r from duplicate dna extracts for each time point amplicon sequencing was performed on an illumina miseq sequencer by majorbio bio pharm technology shanghai china using a miseq reagent kit with 250 bp paired end reads operational taxonomic units with 97 identity were clustered by uparse version 9 2 after singletons and chimeric sequences were removed 44 principal coordinate analysis was used to evaluate the relationships among microbial community from different samples 45 the raw sequencing data were deposited via the ncbi sra with the bioproject prjna672768 2 5 metagenomic analysis dna samples were extracted from r0 r1 r2 at day 130 according to the manufacturer s protocol of fastdna spin kit shenergy biocolor china the metagenomics libraries were sequenced on a hiseq xten sequencer illumina by majorbio bio pharm technology shanghai china to generate 150 nt paired end reads the raw dna reads can be accessed on the ncbi sra with the bioproject prjna671822 in order to improve the reliability of data analysis raw reads were quality filtered for the subsequent statistical analysis and gene function prediction using bbduk with the parameters qtrim rl trimq 10 46 diamond version 0 8 34 47 was used to compare sample dna reads against the databases of denitrification relative enzymes the database containing 7 denitrification key enzymes was created as referred to in 45 http hdl handle net 1813 57594 and the accessory genes database containing 8 nitrous oxide reductase subunits was a custom manually curated database whose initial sequences were from ncbi and had an e value cut off 10 5 to the reference sequence used in the initial search https www ebi ac uk tools hmmer kaiju version 1 5 0 was used for the taxonomic assignment analyze of reads using the kbase platform 48 49 metagenomic assembled genomes mags were recovered and relative abundance of each mag was predicted details in the si miga was applied for taxonomic assignment of the mags 50 3 results and discussion 3 1 biomass performance n2o production of the biomass was periodically monitored by batch tests run with initial concentrations of 200 mg l 1 cod and 50 mg l 1 nitrite n but with no added acetylene this makes the maximum theoretical n2o production around 50 mg n l 1 indicated by the grey line in fig 1 as shown in fig 1 no n2o was detected during any of the incubations using biomass sampled from r0 n2o did accumulate in incubations with the r1 biomass with an average accumulation of 12 8 7 0 mg n l 1 but there was no consistent trend among the samples the maximum accumulation was 27 8 mg n l 1 giving a maximum n2o production efficiency n2o pemax of 56 2 for the biomass from r2 the n2o production showed an overall upward trend as the incubation progressed and the n2o pemax could be maintained 94 0 after 100 days demonstrating that long term exposure of acetylene at high concentrations resulted in a high n2o production during the nitrite denitrification process 3 2 bacterial community dynamics to assess the structure and dynamics of the underlying microbial consortia in the three bioreactors during adaptation to long term cultivation with or without acetylene the microbial communities were periodically characterized using high throughput 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing unweighted principal coordinate analysis based on amplicon sequencing results showed the communities rapidly diverged from the inoculum fig s1 two trends show up with prolonged 50 days incubation first is that the 10 and 40 community diverge from the 0 community and show overlap the second trend is that there is a shift in community phylotypes in the long term incubations irrespective of the presence or absence of acetylene the relative abundances of the twenty most abundant phylotypes at the family level are shown in fig 2 at the end of the incubation the dominant bacterial families in the 0 acetylene reactor r0 were rhodocyclaceae 17 4 cytophagaceae 11 1 and blastocatellaceae 9 5 r1 showed major differences from r0 with norank c alphaproteobacteria 19 4 cytophagaceae 10 9 and rhodocyclaceae 8 3 becoming the most abundant bacterial families in r2 the dominant families were saprospiraceae 42 2 rhodocyclaceae 12 9 and rhodobacteraceae 10 6 analysis of the pearson correlation coefficient suggested a positive correlation between the n2o pemax at each stage in the three reactors and the abundance of saprospiraceae and rhodobacteraceae p 0 05 focusing on r2 the abundance of rhodobacteraceae and saprospiraceae increased continuously throughout its operation from an initial 1 4 and 3 2 respectively to 10 6 and 42 2 saprospiraceae dominated the microbial community at the end of the incubation the inoculum in this study was conventional activated sludge from wastewater treatment system where these organisms are abundant since they are frequently isolated from this environment 51 obviously saprospiraceae were much better adapted for growth in the presence of 40 acetylene the results of statistical analysis and bacterial abundance collectively indicated that saprospiraceae may have special physiological properties that make them develop well in this environment or they may play an important role in achieving efficient n2o production members of this family have the ability to utilize complex carbon sources such a role has been demonstrated in the wastewater treatment systems with activated sludge 52 if the physiological properties of saprospiraceae are responsible for the high abundance then saprospiraceae may use not only sodium acetate but also acetylene in the system for its own growth and reproduction 3 3 community metagenomic analysis to better understand shifts in key functional traits within the community in response to different level of acetylene metagenomics was used to analyze the abundance of key denitrification genes abundances of the key genes in the nitrite denitrification pathway are shown in fig 3 relative abundance of each gene was evaluated by normalizing the annotated reads to reads per million total reads rpm the total abundance of genes encoding no2 reductase including nirk and nirs did not show notable differences in a comparison of r0 130 rpm r1 91 rpm and r2 130 rpm in the three reactors the abundance of nirs were more than twice that of nirk indicating that the denitrifiers containing nirs were the dominant no2 reducers as the source of n2o the abundance of cnorb and qnorz encoding no reductase showed a trend of being positively correlated with acetylene levels normalized read values were highest in r2 cnorb and qnorz with 67 rpm and 50 rpm respectively followed by r1 47 rpm and 43 rpm respectively and the lowest abundance was in r0 41 rpm and 36 rpm respectively nosz is the functional gene encoding n2o reductase which reduces n2o to n2 notably it is relatively abundant in all three conditions having normalized read values of 169 rpm 134 rpm and 179 rpm with the value of nosz nirk being 1 7 2 0 and 2 0 in r0 r1 and r2 respectively the potential of n2o reduction in three bioreactors were greater than that of n2o production these results show that the efficient production of n2o were not controlled by the abundance of key denitrification genes long term acetylene incubation did not cause a significant shift in the occurrence of this gene in the community the emergence of denitrifying microflora lacking nosz did not occur although it is possible the taxonomic distribution might have changed recent work has shown nosz has two clades noszⅰ and noszⅱ 53 54 in r1 and r2 the abundance of noszⅱ is 2 3 times higher than that of noszⅰ in r0 the abundance of noszⅰ 75 rpm was similar to that of noszⅱ 95 rpm in addition to nosz the typical nos operon also contains a number of accessory genes required for assembly or activity of the nos enzyme these include nosdfyl which are involved in the assembly of its copper centers 55 56 genes are also present whose products are required for maintaining nitrous oxide reductase in an active state these include nosr and nosx which are unique to the noszⅰ gene cluster 53 the abundance of nosr and nosx were significantly higher in the r0 41 rpm and 6 rpm respectively than the other two reactors with 11 rpm and 2 rpm in r1 22 rpm and 3 rpm in r2 respectively which is consistent with more noszⅰ reads in this reactor fig 3 normally in constructed wetlands eutrophic waters or nitrogen enriched bioreactors the abundance of bacteria utilizing noszⅰ is higher than noszⅱ 57 however noszⅱ bacteria dominated in the bioreactors to which acetylene was added taxonomy of nosz and other denitrification reads was assigned at the family level using kaiju more than 95 of the reads could be assigned figs 4 and s2 in all the bioreactors zoogloeaceae accounted for a large proportion of the bacteria harboring noszⅰ the reads assigned as noszii were from flavobacteriaceae 16 28 chitinophagaceae 12 18 cytophagaceae 6 8 and sphingobacteriaceae 6 8 reads from the rhodobacteraceae and the saprospiraceae whose occurrence correlated with n2o accumulation were not common in the denitrification reads reads for nirs cnorb and noszⅰ were all predicted to have come from members of the rhodobacteraceae but at low levels relative to other groups such as the zoogloeaceae figs 4 and s2 no reads from nir nor and nos were predicted to have come from the saprospiraceae figs 4 and s2 interestingly assembly yielded one high quality draft mag belonging to saprospiraceae sap1 with 90 22 completeness and 9 03 contamination the examination of this genome showed it harbored the noszii gene but none of the other accessory genes other than nosf were present suggesting this organism might not make an active nos 58 the absence of saprospiraceae in the kaiju output is likely due to the members of this family containing nosz being relatively uncommon and consequently not found in the comparison dataset this conclusion and the absence of other denitrification genes from this group suggests the dominance of saprospiraceae has no direct correlation with high n2o production it is more likely correlated to tolerance and or metabolism of acetylene but more work is needed to support this conclusion 3 4 durability of n2o production in batch experiments the metagenomic data suggested that the high levels of n2o found in the long term cultivation with acetylene was not due to an increase in truncated denitrifiers lacking nosz and its accessory genes this suggests that once acetylene is removed nos activity will return to test this community batch experiments were conducted in the absence of acetylene using biomass cultivated with 40 acetylene in these experiments once the 50 mg l 1 nitrite n nitrite was completely reduced the substrate was renewed starting a new cycle fig 5 consistent with bioreactor performance experiments the n2o pemax was 96 2 in the 1st cycle however the n2o production showed a steady rapid decline in subsequent cycles and dropped to 0 by the 4th cycle high n2o production could be immediately recovered by addition of acetylene into the headspace these results demonstrated the high n2o production capability of this cultivated biomass was strictly dependent on the presence of acetylene in the absence of acetylene the n2o reducing capacity of the communities cultivated with or without acetylene were similar as well showing that acetylene has no lasting impact on nos activity in these cells fig 1 studies have reported that 10 acetylene is the ec30 of nitrifiers 59 while there are few studies on the effective concentration of denitrifiers in the practice of agriculture the acetylene concentration of acetylene inhibition technique is usually set at 10 38 60 which does not affect the regular growth of microorganisms this is why three different levels of acetylene were set in this study which were control group 0 low concentration 10 and high concentration 40 of acetylene the results presented here give some clues to the mechanism of n2o accumulation resulting from long term exposure of high concentration acetylene during nitrite denitrification this kind of long term acclimation leads to effective and stable n2o accumulation with up to 98 6 efficiency the n2o pemax values in this study were higher than those in previous related studies on denitrifying n2o production 2 16 during the cultivation period the bacterial community underwent large changes as it adapted to acetylene metagenomic analysis after long term incubation in the presence of acetylene showed the community retained levels of nosz and accessory genes equivalent to the community not exposed to acetylene fig 3 interestingly though while the long term exposure to acetylene did not lead to significant decrease in nosz reads it did lead to a bias in favor of noszⅱ recent work has suggested that the unique electron transport module in organisms with clade ii nos makes them have a higher substrate affinity compared to nosz clade i type bacteria 61 62 assuming clade ii nos do have higher affinity due to its low energy translocation pathway and efficient energy conversion 63 clade ii type microorganisms may enable to show some limited turnover and perform certain functions under these conditions allowing their increase in the community this might suggest acetylene and n2o compete for a common binding site on the enzyme however since noszⅱ is found in a more diverse group of bacteria 64 it is more likely that the acetylene tolerance phenotype will occur within this group little evidence supports denitrification plays an important role in the growth of saprospiraceae therefore this tolerance may also explain why members of the saprospiraceae dominated in the 40 acetylene bioreactor batch tests indicated that nos activity began to appear no later than 3 h and completely regained after about 6 h upon the removal of acetylene fig 5 acetylene likely has a transitory impact on some aspect of expression or function of the proteins required for n2o reduction fig 5 considering cells can divide in the range of 104 to 105 seconds 65 the lag period needed to recover the n2o reduction capacity may represent the time required for cells to divide and for new cells to synthesize active nos it is also possible that this time frame represents the time needed to accumulate sufficient levels of newly synthesized nos in existing cells to allow for detectable n2o reduction one mechanism that can be ruled out is that the community expresses nos that becomes active immediately upon acetylene removal the mechanism by which acetylene inactivates nos cannot be resolved here and awaits further metatranscriptomics and pure culture studies 4 conclusion in this study the ability of long term cultivation with acetylene to give rise to efficient recovery of nitrogen in wastewater in the form of n2o was explored the performance of cultured biomass indicated that n2o could be produced with 98 6 efficiency under long term acclimation in the presence of high concentrations of acetylene metagenomics analysis revealed that n2o accumulation did not occur via a decrease in nosz within the community however there was a community change since denitrifiers utilizing noszⅱ gradually dominated in the presence of acetylene batch experiments in series indicated that the n2o reduction capability was transiently affected by acetylene and was rapidly regained upon removal this study elucidates the issue of the long term effect of acetylene on n2o reduction and gains improved understanding of the acetylene inhibition on denitrifier community at the genetic level declaration of

13447,maximizing production and use of n2o produced by the process of denitrification has emerged as a promising concept for energy recovery from nitrogen acetylene is well known as an inhibitor of n2o reductase activity however to date few studies have utilized long term cultivation with acetylene to achieve denitrifying n2o recovery this work assessed the performance of n2o production and shifts in the denitrifying community in response to long term exposure of acetylene during nitrite denitrification batch tests showed that long term exposure to acetylene at high concentrations volume fraction 40 resulted in high n2o accumulation up to 98 6 high throughput 16s rrna gene analysis suggested that saprospiraceae dominated the microbial community at the end of the cultivation period with its abundance increasing from the initial 3 2 to 42 2 metagenomic analysis revealed that after the long term cultivation under high level acetylene the relative abundance of nosz in the community did not change significantly instead the noszⅱ harboring bacteria became dominant batch tests in series demonstrated that n2o reduction could be restored rapidly upon removal of acetylene this study describes an effective method for high yield production of n2o during nitrite denitrification that can be used to enhance energy recovery and improves our understanding of the long term effect of acetylene on the denitrifying community keywords n2o recovery denitrification acetylene denitrifying community metagenomics 1 introduction n2o is well known as a potent greenhouse gas 1 2 which can also result in the destruction of stratospheric ozone 3 4 in addition to the environmentally harmful impacts n2o has been recently proposed as a sustainable energy source 5 6 if properly captured considerable energy can be generated when n2o is utilized as strong oxidizing agent in combustion reactions 7 8 compared with the stoichiometric combustion of 1 mol of ch4 with o2 roughly 30 more energy is produced via combustion of equivalent ch4 with n2o 9 n2o has also been used as a fuel additive in rocket propellants and motor racing in order to improve the power output of engines 10 11 therefore achieving efficient recovery of n2o in the wastewater treatment systems has significant environmental and energy benefits 12 it can not only reduce the greenhouse effect but also realize the bioenergy recovery of nitrogen contaminated wastewater nitrogen removal is a major goal in both municipal and industrial wastewater biological treatment systems 13 15 during nitrogen removal abiotic mechanisms for generating n2o are possible 16 for example the reaction of nitrite with ferrous iron to form no which can then further react with ferrous iron to form n2o 17 18 however it is worth noting that the high dosage of ferrous iron required for this method of n2o production not only results in expensive operational costs but also creates waste sludge with hazardous levels of iron 11 microbial denitrification is a more feasible alternative and the one contributing the most to global n2o bioproduction 19 20 to lessen energy costs and maximize energy generation there has been extensive interest in shortening the traditional process of nitrification i e nh4 no2 no3 and denitrification i e no3 no2 no n2o n2 with nitrite as the bridge and link during nitrogen removal 21 23 hence nitrogen removal coupled to n2o recovery during the nitrite denitrification process is potentially a promising approach for the energy production 24 25 the coupled aerobic anoxic nitrous decomposition operation cando process is representative of this approach 16 during this n removal process alternating acetate and nitrite pulses cause cells to store intracellular polyhydroxybutyrate phb as the source of electrons in denitrification and this results in reduction of reactive no2 to n2o 26 cando has been reported to achieve efficient and stable denitrifier based n2o production ratios of about 65 80 9 this is a significant improvement in n2o production over conventional nitrogen bioremoval processes however the complex operation required for supplying carbon and nitrite by turns restricts the implementation of cando in practice since a majority of wastewaters will contain both consequently new techniques of n2o production applied to wastewater with c and n coexisting need to be developed nitrite denitrification from no2 to n2 involves three reduction steps containing nitrite reductase nir nitric oxide reductase nor and nitrous oxide reductase nos with no and n2o as intermediates 27 28 referring to the denitrifying electron transfer chain preventing the biological reduction of n2o to n2 is essential for achieving high n2o product yields 12 29 previous work has shown that various environmental factors e g free nitrous acid fna 30 low ph 20 moderate do exposure 31 32 and low cod n 33 34 all have a positive effect on n2o production from denitrification 35 acetylene is an additional well known compound that is used as a bioassay inhibitor of n2o reductase to allow estimation of short term denitrification fluxes in some natural ecosystems 36 38 based on the previous studies describing acetylene inhibition the presence of acetylene in the range of 1 10 caused complete or almost complete inhibition of n2o reduction by pure and mixed suspensions of denitrifying cells 38 39 nosz lacking denitrifiers have been shown to be common in some environments 40 we hypothesized the presence of acetylene might lead to a decrease of nosz in the community since it no longer provides a selectable benefit it has been shown that communities enriched for this type of truncation produce higher levels of n2o 41 however it is also possible that nosz occurrence in the community may not change as the gene has been found in environments that produce n2o as dominant end product 42 the aims of this study were to observe the impact of prolonged acetylene cultivation on an activated sludge system with a particular focus on n2o production during nitrite denitrification as a broad gauge of the impact of acetylene high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing was adopted to assess changes in the bacterial community metagenomics was used to explore the functional community shifts including those impacting the key noszi and noszii gene clades this study will allow better understanding of the response of denitrifying communities to the long term presence of acetylene which can provide fundamental knowledge for further engineering development and application of denitrification based and acetylene derived high yield n2o recovery processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor operation three reactors of 250 ml designated r0 r1 and r2 with identical working volumes of 200 ml were operated in sequencing batch mode for 130 days the initial volatile suspended solids vss concentrations in the reactors was 3 7 g l 1 and the inoculation sludge was taken from the changqiao municipal wastewater treatment plant shanghai china the operation conditions of reactors were as follows synthetic wastewater hydraulic retention time of 12 h mixed speed of 120 rpm a temperature of 30 and initial ph of 7 0 0 1 at the beginning of each cycle 0 5 and 20 ml air were extracted from the headspace of the three airtight reactors r0 r1 and r2 respectively and the corresponding volumes of acetylene were injected in reactors to achieve the acetylene concentrations of 0 10 and 40 v v the reactors were fed a stock solution of sodium nitrite and sodium acetate nitrite n 50 mg l 1 cod 200 mg l 1 the mineral medium excluding c and n source is described in the si 2 2 biomass performance monitoring batch tests to determine n2o production efficiency of the extracted biomass were carried out every 10 days in triplicate serum bottles 120 ml placed in an shaking table 120 rpm at 30 without acetylene 20 ml of activated sludge was taken from r0 r1 and r2 respectively and washed with distilled water three times for the test both pretreated sludge and 70 ml of mineral medium were added to the serum bottles to obtain an initial concentration of 1 8 g vss l 1 1 m hcl or 1 m naoh was supplied to adjust the initial ph to 7 0 0 1 nitrogen aeration at 250 ml min 1 for 5 min was supplied to remove do and residual acetylene in the system the serum bottles were then immediately sealed with rubber plugs and aluminum caps 50 mg l 1 nitrite n and 200 mg l 1 cod were provided at the initial stage of each batch test batch tests in series were also carried out without acetylene to determine the acetylene durability on n2o production using the activated sludge from r2 other experimental conditions were the same as the batch tests described above in addition once the 50 mg l 1 nitrite n was completely reduced the same amount of nitrite was added again to allow the batch tests to be conducted in series 2 3 analytical methods at regular intervals the mixed liquid in the batch tests were sampled for analysis of nh4 no3 no2 and cod at the same time the headspace of the serum bottle was sampled for the analysis of n2o liquor samples were collected by a syringe and filtered through disposable millipore filter units 0 22 μm pore size at once the concentrations of nh4 no3 and no2 were measured according to standard methods 43 sodium acetate were measured on a shimadzu gc2014c gas chromatograph with flame ionization detector and an hp innowax column n2o concentrations in the headspace were determined on a shimadzu gc2014c gas chromatograph with a porapak q column and flame ionization detector 25 the method for determination of n2o concentrations is described in the si 2 4 amplicon sequencing for 16s rrna gene

miseq reagent kit with 250 bp paired end reads operational taxonomic units with 97 identity were clustered by uparse version 9 2 after singletons and chimeric sequences were removed 44 principal coordinate analysis was used to evaluate the relationships among microbial community from different samples 45 the raw sequencing data were deposited via the ncbi sra with the bioproject prjna672768 2

qtrim rl trimq 10 46 diamond version 0 8 34 47 was used to compare sample dna reads against the databases of denitrification relative enzymes the database containing 7 denitrification key enzymes was created as referred to in 45 http hdl handle net 1813 57594 and the accessory genes database containing 8 nitrous oxide reductase subunits was a custom manually curated database whose initial sequences were from ncbi and had an e value cut off 10 5 to the reference sequence used in the initial search https www ebi ac uk tools hmmer kaiju version 1 5 0 was used for the taxonomic assignment analyze of reads using the kbase platform 48 49 metagenomic assembled genomes mags were recovered and relative abundance of each mag was predicted details in the si miga was applied for taxonomic assignment of the mags 50 3 results and discussion 3 1 biomass performance n2o production of the biomass was periodically monitored by batch tests run with initial concentrations of 200 mg l 1 cod and 50 mg l 1 nitrite n but with no added acetylene this makes the maximum theoretical n2o production around 50 mg n l 1 indicated by the grey line in fig 1 as shown in fig 1 no n2o was detected during any of the incubations using biomass sampled from r0 n2o did accumulate in incubations with the r1 biomass with an average accumulation of 12 8 7 0 mg n l 1 but there was no consistent trend among the samples the maximum accumulation was 27 8 mg n l 1 giving a maximum n2o production efficiency n2o pemax of 56 2 for the biomass from r2 the n2o production showed an overall upward trend as the incubation progressed and the n2o pemax could be maintained 94 0 after 100 days demonstrating that long term exposure of acetylene at high concentrations resulted in a high n2o production during the nitrite denitrification process 3 2 bacterial community dynamics to assess the structure and dynamics of the underlying microbial consortia in the three bioreactors during adaptation to long term cultivation with or without acetylene the microbial communities were periodically characterized using high throughput 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing unweighted principal coordinate analysis based on amplicon sequencing results showed the communities rapidly diverged from the inoculum fig s1 two trends show up with prolonged 50 days incubation first is that the 10 and 40 community diverge from the 0 community and show overlap the second trend is that there is a shift in community phylotypes in the long term incubations irrespective of the presence or absence of acetylene the relative abundances of the twenty most abundant phylotypes at the family level are shown in fig 2 at the end of the incubation the dominant bacterial families in the 0 acetylene reactor r0 were rhodocyclaceae 17 4 cytophagaceae 11 1 and blastocatellaceae 9 5 r1 showed major differences from r0 with norank c alphaproteobacteria 19 4 cytophagaceae 10 9 and rhodocyclaceae 8 3 becoming the most abundant bacterial families in r2 the dominant families were saprospiraceae 42 2 rhodocyclaceae 12 9 and rhodobacteraceae 10 6 analysis of the pearson correlation coefficient suggested a positive correlation between the n2o pemax at each stage in the three reactors and the abundance of saprospiraceae and rhodobacteraceae p 0 05 focusing on r2 the abundance of rhodobacteraceae and saprospiraceae increased continuously throughout its operation from an initial 1 4 and 3 2 respectively to 10 6 and 42 2 saprospiraceae dominated the microbial community at the end of the incubation the inoculum in this study

saprospiraceae may use not only sodium acetate but also acetylene in the system for its own growth and reproduction 3 3 community metagenomic analysis to better understand shifts in key functional traits within the community in response to different level of acetylene metagenomics was used to analyze the abundance of key denitrification genes abundances of the key genes in the nitrite

tolerance may also explain why members of the saprospiraceae dominated in the 40 acetylene bioreactor batch tests indicated that nos activity began to appear no later than 3 h and completely regained after about 6 h upon the removal of acetylene fig 5 acetylene likely has a transitory impact on some aspect of expression or function of the proteins required for n2o reduction fig 5 considering cells can divide in the range of 104 to 105 seconds 65 the lag period needed to recover the n2o reduction capacity may represent the time required for cells to divide and for new cells to synthesize active nos it is also possible that this time frame represents the time needed to accumulate sufficient levels of newly synthesized nos in existing cells to allow for detectable n2o reduction one mechanism that can be ruled out is that the community expresses nos that becomes active immediately upon acetylene removal the mechanism by which acetylene inactivates nos cannot be resolved here and awaits further metatranscriptomics and pure culture studies 4 conclusion in this study the ability of long term cultivation with acetylene to give rise to efficient recovery of nitrogen in wastewater in the form of n2o was explored the performance of cultured biomass indicated that n2o could be produced with 98 6 efficiency under long term acclimation in the presence of high concentrations of acetylene metagenomics analysis revealed that n2o accumulation did not occur via a decrease in nosz within the community however there was a community change since denitrifiers utilizing noszⅱ gradually dominated in the presence of acetylene batch experiments in series indicated that the n2o reduction capability was transiently affected by acetylene and was rapidly regained upon removal this study elucidates the issue of the long term effect of acetylene on n2o reduction and gains improved understanding of the acetylene inhibition on denitrifier community at the genetic level declaration of

13448,the increase on pork meat demand is consequently leading to higher production of swine wastewater these wastewaters are problematic due to their high organic matter load and nutrients content that can promote soil and aquatic sources contamination the conventional effluents treatment technologies seem to be inefficient for total organic matter and contaminants removal while demanding high retention times one of the steps considered for the swine wastewater treatment is solid liquid separation in this work coagulation using polydadmac was evaluated and the effect of the coagulant concentration for this purpose was tested this methodology was compared with an innovative approach involving biofiltration through the invasive bivalve corbicula fluminea the effects of the liquid to clam s ratio was assessed as well as the mechanism of organic matter removal and the clams reuse capacity the best chemical oxygen demand cod removal obtained was 51 using 1 l of effluent per 150 clams moreover it was possible to reuse the clams during 4 cycles without losing significant efficiency on the cod removal moreover the toxicity of the treated wastewater was evaluated regarding aliivibrio fischeri and lepidium sativum aeration without clams reduced the toxicity levels however for lepidium sativum germination index the best result was obtained for the wastewater treated by clams thus c fluminea presents potential for swine wastewater treatment keywords swine wastewater coagulation biofiltration corbicula fluminea toxicity assessment 1 introduction swine wastewater is typically composed by faeces and urine as well as wash waters which contain a high amount of straws and animal food the composition of swine wastewater is highly dependent upon the pig species animal food composition and the swinery washing system 1 this wastewater is also characterized by high organic matter concentration and great amount of nutrients such as nitrogen n and phosphorous p since the pigs cannot absorb them in their digestion system 2 heavy metals can be found such as cu and zn as well as antibiotics 3 4 therefore the excretions of pigs increase the presence of these contaminants in water and soils promoting water eutrophication and greenhouse gas emissions 5 moreover the conventional swine wastewater treatments are usually inefficient for high organic matter and nutrients concentrations removal requiring high retention times 2 in fact these treatments can remove part of the organic matter but presents high inefficiency for the inorganic nitrogen and phosporous removal 6 7 on the other hand pig meat demand increases the need for this animal intensive production this leads to the increase of antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals consumption as well as the swine wastewater loads the streams resulting from the swine production are increasingly more complex and fuller of refractory contaminants such as antibiotics 2 6 7 this also means an increase of water consumption which is a problem due to the water scarcity concern therefore water reuse within the swinery should be promoted the structures used to pork production limit the animal space and to prevent diseases that can be catastrophic due to the animal proximity an increasing on the antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals used has been observed 8 9 the presence of these pharmaceutical compounds in the wastewater is problematic since the conventional wastewater treatments cannot remove them efficiently 10 the swine wastewater could be prejudicial for human health and aquatic species additionally its disposal in the agriculture farms increases water contamination due to the soils leaching despite the pharmaceutical compounds the high organic matter should also be problematic for plants and seeds germination due the inherent high toxicity 4 the traditional treatment of swine wastewater requires space due to the high retention times required in the processes that include solid liquid separation aerobic lagoons and or anaerobic digestion 11 12 nowadays it is important to find suitable solutions for reducing the space requirements to achieve an efficient treatment one of the initial steps could be the removal of solids from the liquid phase the coagulation process could be an appropriate methodology for this achievement the coagulant will neutralize the charges producing bridges between solid particles the solid aggregated particles then can be removed by sedimentation filtration or flotation 12 typically the liquid phase resulting from this process presents low amount of nitrogen and phosphorous 12 gabriel et al 13 applied a tannin organic coagulant for swine wastewater treatment and achieved an effective reduction of turbidity polydadmac is a high charge density cationic polymer widely used in the coagulation flocculation systems of drinking water and wastewater treatment 14 15 corbicula fluminea is a filter feeder that can uptake store and excrete chemical compounds 16 17 the resistance of these clams under adverse conditions and the biofiltration capacity make this species a suitable option for bioremediation of water and wastewater 18 20 some studies can be found regarding their application for organic matter removal from winery and olive mill wastewater 21 23 moreover these clams could also be employed for metal elements removal 24 also their efficiency for disinfection removal of bacteria virus and protozoa was already proven 25 28 however the mechanism used by the clams for contaminants removal can influence their final destination 19 in fact some of these compounds can be accumulated in the tissues or even in the valve shells 23 28 to the best of our knowledge no studies were performed with invasive bivalves for real swine wastewater treatment the application of c fluminea for swine wastewater depuration may be envisaged as a new pest management approach since these bivalves need to be controlled due to their invasive character 29 the present work studied the number of clam s effect on the organic removal as well as the mechanism involved in biofiltration and the possibility of clam s reuse these results were compared with coagulation process using different concentrations as well as the coagulant addition method furthermore in order to ensure a safe disposal of the treated wastewater the toxicity of the treated solutions was compared with the initial swine wastewater over two species aliivibrio fischeri and lepidium sativum considering this is the first time of such broadly study using clams as biofilters aiming at reducing organic matter and toxicity impact using two different species 2 material and methods 2 1 swine wastewater for these experiments a real wastewater was collected from a swine farmer located in the center region of portugal this wastewater was taken concentrated from the outlet of the swine farmer production at the collection day no cleaning was performed at the swinery this means that the wastewater is highly concentrated usually a ratio of 1 12 5 of wastewater per cleaning water is applied at the swinery thus in order to have a more representative sample the collected wastewater was diluted accordingly for this dilution the initial characterization of swine wastewater is presented in table 1 the considered parameters were chemical oxygen demand cod total solids ts total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn and ph 2 2 coagulation experiments polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride polydadmac as a highly charged cationic polymer was applied for swine wastewater coagulation to separate the solid fraction from the liquid phase in the coagulation tests a certain volume of a 0 1 polydadmac stock solution was added to 200 ml of wastewater during a first stage of fast stirring 140 5 rpm for 3 min followed by 15 min of slow stirring 35 5 rpm to facilitate solids agglomeration after 30 min of sedimentation supernatant s samples were taken for further chemical analysis the effect of coagulant loading 10 60 mg l was studied to determine the optimum conditions additionally the effect of partially adding the coagulant instead of the initial addition of the overall amount was studied the partial addition was made in two stages and while the first one serves to destabilize the mixture the second one allows a better aggregation of destabilized particles which can enhance the removal of solids from the liquid phase the experiments were performed in a jar test equipment 2 3 biofiltration experiments the swine wastewater treatment by corbicula fluminea was made in 500 ml glass biofilters these tests were carried out at 20 c under a photoperiod cycle 16 h light 8 h dark and continuous aeration the clams were kept in dechlorinated water for about one week where the water was changed every two days the clams were collected from a canal in mira portugal n40 25 06 90 w8 44 13 18 where a well established population density above 2000 clams m2 exists this canal is composed by standing water with a great accumulation of organic matter and enteric pathogens due to this it was necessary an initial biodepuration of enteric pathogens and organic matter to avoid disturbing the clam s performance on the swine wastewater treatment the tests were performed in duplicate with different ratios of clams per liter of swine wastewater from 1 20 to 1 150 individuals with shell length in the range 20 30 mm were selected to perform these experiments to control the effect of the clams on the swine wastewater treatment and to bear in mind the aerobic degradation of the effluent through microorganisms a glass biofilter with the wastewater in duplicate was maintained at the same conditions but without clams moreover to validate the test a blank with dechlorinated water was placed with the clams samples were taken for chemical oxygen demand cod analysis at different times from 2 until 24 h the clam s mortality was also measured mortality of clams was verified at each time by checking if there was evidence of siphoning activity or if clams were closed by measuring resistance when forcing valve opening 15 to guarantee that the cod from the swine wastewater was removed by biofiltration and not just by adsorption experiments with the clam s empty shell were performed moreover the cod with aeration was also measured as well as 5 min after turning off the aeration since the particles during the bubbling can be dispersed in the biofilter the reuse of clams for the swine wastewater treatment was also analyzed for that clams were used for biofiltration during 4 h and after this they were placed in dechlorinated tap water during 20 h and then putted again in contact with fresh swine wastewater this procedure was repeated during 3 times to assure the capacity of clams to be recovered and applied again moreover the presence of air could be important to the aerobic bacteria that exists in the wastewater and may promote the cod aerobic biodegradation therefore the wastewater in contact with the air along one week was also analysed 2 4 analytical methods the concentration of organic matter from the swine wastewater was followed through the chemical oxygen demand cod quantification only soluble and colloidal cod was measured since the swine wastewater contains a high amount of straws and hay which precipitate quickly therefore the cod samples were measured after 5 min of precipitation cod was determined according to the standard method 5220d 30 this consists in the addition of a digestion solution k2cr2o7 an acidic solution h2so4 and ag2so4 and the sample each solution was tested in duplicate and with a control using distilled water instead of the sample absorbance values after 2 h of digestion at 150 c eco25 velp scientifica were measured at 605 nm in a wtw photolab s6 potassium hydrogen phthalate obtained from panreac was used to prepare a calibration curve with cod values within the range 100 4500 mg o2 l ph was determined using a crison microph 2002 apparatus 2 5 toxicity assessment before toxicity evaluation it was necessary to correct the ph of some samples to values within the range 6 5 7 5 the required ph was obtained by adding sodium hydroxide or sulfuric acid solutions to the samples this is important since the ph can affect the toxicity evaluation the luminescence inhibition was measured as an indicator of the toxicity of the samples towards aliivibrio fischeri using a lumistox 300 apparatus dr lange the organisms were exposed to untreated and treated samples after different treatment conditions at 15 c luminescence was measured after 15 min and 30 min and compared with a blank where bacteria were placed in a culture media solution 2 nacl solution to evaluate the phytotoxicity of the initial and treated effluents the number of germinated seeds and the radicle growth of l sativum were determined to calculate the germination index gi 31 the experiments were run in duplicate the petri dishes filled with the samples and seeds were placed in the oven for 48 h at constant temperature of 27 c then the number of seeds germinated and the radicle growth of each one was recorded germination index gi is the product of relative seed germination rsg by relative radicle growth rrg as in eqs 1 3 1 gi rsg x rrg 100 2 rsg n sg t n sg b x 100 3 rrg l r t l r b x 100 where nsg t and nsg b are the arithmetic means of the number of seeds germinated for each sample and blank with distilled water respectively lr t and lr b correspond to the average radicle length for each sample and blank respectively moreover due to the low number of germinated seeds in some experiments the exposure time was extended until 72 h 3 results and discussion 3 1 coagulation experiments swine wastewater is characterized by high content of total solids therefore the coagulation of this wastewater is crucial for solid liquid separation meanwhile to minimize the operation costs it is important to find the optimal coagulant concentration for these experiments different amounts of coagulant from 10 to 60 mg l were selected moreover the effect of the partial addition was analyzed for the 3 highest concentrations of coagulant in this case the addition of coagulant was made in two stages half load in each addition fig 1 shows the cod removal after each coagulation experiment the coagulation of swine wastewater clearly enhanced cod removal for the best results it was possible to remove about 40 of cod in fact the increase of concentration until 40 mg l enhances cod removal while for 60 mg l a further effect is almost negligible on the other hand the effect of coagulation regarding the total cod removal efficiency was about 80 for 40 mg l due to the initial high amount of solids such as straws and hays that easily sediment the results will only be analyzed in terms of soluble cod removal to be more comparable the partial addition slightly increases the cod removal for the 20 30 and 40 mg l but for 60 mg l it does not promote any modification when compared with 40 mg l the main objective of coagulation is the removal of solids from the liquid phase the effect of the coagulant load was also determined for total solids ts depletion in this regard the concentration of coagulant does not present a significant impact contrarily to what happens to cod for 30 mg l it was possible to remove 50 8 of initial ts whereas for 40 and 60 mg l 51 7 and 51 5 were removed respectively this negligible difference can be related with the presence of particles of high size that can be easily removed even with low coagulant concentration moreover the 60 mg l case presents an insignificant decrease in the ts removal efficiency which can be related with the excess of the coagulant for this wastewater the excess of coagulant can destabilize the particles again and difficult sedimentation gonzález fernández et al 32 applied 200 mg l of polyacrylamide cationic to remove about 39 of soluble cod from swine wastewater moreover using 186 mg l of another polyacrylamide led to a soluble cod removal of 31 33 hong et al 34 studied different concentrations of polyaluminium chloride pac from 50 to 300 mg l of coagulant and achieved an optimum for cod removal about 66 with a dose of 250 mg l when fecl3 was used as coagulant the authors verified that the removal of pollutants was a function of coagulant dosage and the highest values were obtained using a fe3 dosage of 150 mg as fe l subsequently the addition of fecl3 resulted in higher cod removal compared with using the pac as a coagulant these results are in accordance with the cod removal obtained in the present study however it must be pointed out the low amount of coagulant used in our study compared with those found in the literature which can mean a reduction on the cost for coagulation step 3 2 biofiltration 3 2 1 effect of exposure time despite the resistance to adverse conditions the exposure time of clams to swine wastewater can be problematic the clams when subjected to the adverse conditions due the presence of toxic compounds or high organic loads can close their valves as protective behavior 35 on the other hand if the conditions are adverse the clams may not resist which will promote the clam s mortality 15 therefore the effect of time on the cod removal and the clam s mortality during 24 h was analyzed the swine wastewater natural degradation was also observed since the presence of microorganisms naturally present in the wastewater with air can promote the aerobic digestion of organic matter the sedimentation of small particles along the day could also decrease the cod value this effect was analyzed by bubbling air to repeat the conditions with the clams and the air increases the dissolved oxygen which would promote the activity of aerobic microorganisms enhancing the degradation of biological organic matter fig 2 compares cod removal along time for biofiltration and aeration only the times selected to take samples for clams experiment were 4 6 and 24 h for this experiment the ratio of 1 100 l per clams was used on the first period from 4 to 6 h of exposure it was possible to observe an increase of 6 on the cod removal from 39 to 45 moreover no mortality was observed and the clams presented good aspect since high siphoning activity was detected 35 36 however the continuous exposure to swine wastewater from 6 to 24 h promoted a decrease on the clam s efficiency regarding cod removal compared to the previous period this impact could be related with the presence of ammonia that can be prejudicial for the clams lethal concentration lc50 for ammonia in 96 h of exposure is about 84 mg l 37 in fact at the end of this period a clam s mortality of about 5 was obtained still this value is very low which reveals the resistance of clams to this wastewater moreover the other clams present a closed valve behavior and the remaining also show abnormal foot extension and paralysis unresponsiveness to prodding this specific response of clams can be related with the ions in the swine wastewater lellis et al 38 verified this response of clams with either tight close of the valves or gapping in the presence of potassium ions on the other hand the cod increase that was detected can be related with the physiology activity of clams to release urine and feaces to the water therefore the time selected for undertaking experiments with the clams was 4 h despite of the high cod removal at 6 h the difference was not so sharp and the increase of contact time for further real application means higher volume biofilters the experiment without clams and with bubbling air reveals also the natural potential of microorganisms for cod removal fig 2 however the time scale was totally different one of the methodologies used for swine wastewater treatment is the aerobic lagoons after the solid liquid separation 12 despite of the low solubility of oxygen the air bubbling promoted the presence of higher concentrations of dissolved oxygen this will enhance the aerobic activity of microorganisms on the removal of organic matter in fact after 12 days of aeration the cod removal was about 85 fig 2 however due to the limitation and restrictions of space for the pork production demand regarding to swine wastewater treatment it is important to find suitable alternatives for the decrease on the wastewater treatment time and volume the presence of microorganisms from pig s intestinal tract is a reality that can come at the faeces 39 therefore if the high organic matter persists in the swine wastewater can be related with the indigestible residues that will be slow biodegraded by the microbial community 40 the 12 days or more seems to be enough for microbial community provided by pig s intestinal tract bioprocess great part of organic matter present in the swine wastewater still this implies a high retention treatment time leading to large volumes for the reactors which may not be suitable for all pork production farms 3 2 2 effect of the number of clams corbicula fluminea presents a high capacity to promote the removal of organic matter from the water through biofiltration in this case the swine wastewater is composed by a high amount of nutrients and organic matter that can be biofiltrated by this specie in fact the clams can feed from this kind of wastewater if the toxicity is not so high the mortality of the clams registered for high ratio 1 l per 100 clams tested during 24 h of contact with the swine wastewater was low therefore the clams seem suitable for swine wastewater treatment regarding cod removal in order to analyze the impact of the number of clams on the treatment efficiency the biofiltration experiments were conducted during 4 h fig 3 shows the cod removed after 4 h for different liquid to clam s number ratios as it can be expected the number of clams can affect the cod removal the increase on the number of clams per liter of swine wastewater improves the cod removal ratio in fig 3 l number of clams the typical ratio used in the bioremediation experiments for these clams is 1 20 22 23 gomes et al 28 verified for escherichia coli removal that the increase on the clam s ratio from 1 40 to 1 60 does not increase the efficiency however this could be related with the low initial e coli concentration on the other hand for this swine wastewater the cod value after the biofiltration even with the higher ratio is still high the ratio 1 100 presents a similar result to the one obtained for coagulation experiments with the best conditions meanwhile the ratio 1 150 improves the degradation of the organic matter since the cod removal that was obtained was about 51 in 4 h the final cod value obtained was 2 15 0 30 g l still this cod value is higher than the one permitted for the discharge in aquatic systems 0 15 g l of cod according to the national regulation decree law no 236 98 ferreira et al 22 after 24 h of 1 20 clams ratio exposure reached a cod value about 0 3 g l in winery wastewater with initial cod around 2 g l however it must be considered the high difference between the tested wastewaters composition in fact it was proved the biofiltering capacity of clams to the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons silva et al 2016 which can be detected in the winery wastewater the efficiency differences between biofitration and coagulation are related with the capacity of the clams to remove soluble nutrients and other chemicals such as antibiotics and other organic matter while coagulation acts mainly on suspended and colloidal solids removal the clams due to the high biofiltration capacity can be used for controlling the eutrophication in water reservoirs 41 on the other hand the application of invasive bivalves for pharmaceutical and personal care products has been studied 20 42 gomes et al 20 proved that clams can promote the biofiltration of antibiotics such as sulfamethoxazole smx this antibiotic can be typically found in swine wastewaters 2 therefore the application of clams for cod removal should be a suitable option since these species promote a great contaminants reduction without addition of any chemical to the wastewater 3 2 3 mechanism of cod removal it is clear the effect of the clams on cod removal for all the ratios tested fig 3 but for the highest ratio 1 l 150 clams this value exceeds the efficiency obtained with coagulation through the cationic coagulant thus it is important to understand the mechanism behind the clams biofiltration capability for cod removal one of the capacities of the clams is the possibility of adsorbing the contaminants on the shells 23 24 on the other hand the biofiltration process of clams can result in the biotransformation of lipophilic into hydrophilic metabolites to be excreted 43 moreover the contaminants that cannot be processed by the clams could be also released as a pseudofeaces 23 in this study the cod removal by clam s shell adsorption was tested using empty clams without soft tissue and after drying during 24 h at 105 c this drying is to assure the complete removal of water from the shell the shells were placed with the valves slightly open which increases the area of adsorption the ratio 1 80 clams was tested for the empty clams and the cod removed was about 8 0 2 during 4 h this removal is much lower compared to the one obtained for the live clams where for the same ratio and treatment time it was possible to obtain 30 1 7 for the same period with aeration and without clams the natural cod removal was about 2 1 1 8 comparing this result with the one obtained for the clam s shells it is possible to see a slight improvement on the cod removal which means that a small amount of organic matter was adsorbed on the shell therefore the live clams can promote the efficient biofiltration of organic matter another feature can be the pseudofaeces formation during the biofiltration process pseudofaeces are related with the biofiltered compounds that were not processed by the clam s gill and were rejected and expelled by exhalant siphon involved by a mucous produced on the demibranchs 44 this behavior is a protection of clams against chemical contaminants on these experiments it was possible to observe the mucous production since during biofiltration the solid particles were aggregated by this material the aggregation obtained by this mucous production results on a higher particle sedimentation this can be considered a double action by the clams since this mucous can act as a natural coagulant the second one since the biofiltration presents higher cod removal compared with the coagulation process seems to be related with the biofiltering of some contaminants and organic matter present in the swine wastewater 3 2 4 clams reuse the use of these invasive bivalves on this approach can be seen as an attractive pest management strategy since the traditional one consists on their control by chlorination 45 however the application of these methodologies results on the formation of organochlorinated compounds thus the recourse to a suitable pest management strategy is fundamental to reduce the environmental and economic impact resulting from these invasive bivalves in the ecosystems 29 in fact the biofilters assembly can be integrated with the physical removal of the bivalves from the invaded sites reducing the transport costs the clams reuse during four cycles was analyzed to attest the possibility to continue employing the same clams during several batches rather than removing them and using new ones each time this will allow to manage the clam s usage during more time one of the major drawbacks of using these clams is the transference from the infested sites for the biofilters assembling 19 the possibility of reusing the clams to remove the organic matter from the swine wastewater would reduce the transportation costs moreover these costs could be minimal if the physical removal of the clams from infested sites was coordinated with the biofilter assembling 29 the clams ratio of 1 150 were submitted to 4 h of contact with swine wastewater and then placed during 20 h in dechlorinated tap water this time period will assure that clams are all alive and with good siphoning activity the siphoning activity could be a signal of health and or stress 46 some authors analyze the siphoning behavior by dye removal 47 or by microalgae removal 35 in this study the siphoning activity was observed through the biofilter direct observation and on the cod removal the 4 h of treatment were selected based on the previous results that shown that using 24 h lead to a worst efficiency and higher mortality it should be referred that during these four cycles no clam s mortality was registered at the first reuse cod removal decreased significantly from 51 to 20 fig 4 this means that in this first period the clams are more apprehensive due to the previous contact with the effluent the animals present a protective behavior with the reduction on the siphoning activity contrarily to what happens at the first exposure this low response can be associated with the ammonia accumulation in the tissue which reduces the oxygen exchange and feeding 46 on the other hand the clams could decrease the filtration rates without valve closure behavior 47 in our study it was verified a valve closure behavior for a high amount of the clams indicating the protective response of clams against swine wastewater from the first reuse the clams started to improve the cod removal efficiency for the remaining reuse cycles tested this improvement can be related with the adaptation of clams to the adverse conditions 17 48 the hunger of clams could also be one of the reasons since the clams were not fed during the reuse cycles to not interfere on the biofiltration capacity 23 in fact the first use of the clams was made after a starvation period of about two weeks here it was possible to observe the hunger of clams that lead to higher cod removal on the other hand the two last cycles do not seem to be related with the fact of clams were not fed since at the last reuse cycle the clams enhance the cod removal efficiency comparing to the previous one moreover during the depuration step the clams excrete high amounts of faeces in the dechlorinated tap water this is a sign that clams can bioprocess part of the organic matter biofiltered from swine wastewater therefore according to these results the clams seem to be able to adapt at adverse medium and can survive promoting the biofiltration activity to organic matter removal after proving the biofiltration capacity and the reusability it is important to deal with the contaminated and or dead animals the traditional wastewater treatment also must manage the biosolids provided from the activated sludge 19 here it is also important to find a solution for the clam s disposal one of the most applied methodologies for the swine wastewater is the anaerobic digestion 49 meanwhile some studies can be found revealing the low efficiency of this method on the wastewater treatment due to the high organic loading rates 50 51 consequently the application of biofiltration before anaerobic digestion to remove part of the organic matter can be suitable moreover the dead clam s tissue can also contribute for the anaerobic digestion since this material can be a source of biodegradable organic matter 40 thus anaerobic digestion can be a method to manage the wasted clams after biofiltration moreover in accordance with the obtained results the high final cod value does not allow the wastewater discharge in water sources and the biofiltration can work as a pretreatment of such complex wastewater therefore the biofiltration can be applied before anaerobic digestion which is one of the most used technologies for swine wastewater treatment however if the aim is to obtain a better quality treatment in lower time biofiltration may precede an advanced oxidation process application such as fenton ozone or electrochemical oxidation 52 53 3 3 toxicity assessment one of the most common final destinations of this type of wastewater is the agriculture soil 54 however the continuous disposal of untreated streams will promote the contamination of ground and surface water due to the leaching of the contaminants 54 the use of a pre treatment such as coagulation and biofiltration may reduce the environmental impact of the swine wastewater the impacts of raw and treated wastewater on bacteria was evaluated this analysis is relevant to infer about the potential of surface water contamination related for example with the presence of antibiotics in swine wastewater 2 on the other hand considering the application of this wastewater on soil its effect on the germination of cress was evaluated the treated solutions by clams ratio 1 150 and coagulation 40 mg l were compared with the samples coming from simple aeration during different periods of time 3 3 1 aliivibrio fischeri these bacteria are very sensitive under adverse conditions 55 56 the initial swine wastewater leads to a luminescence inhibition li related to the control of 92 10 0 3 for both exposure periods considered 15 and 30 min table 2 these periods were selected to check the effect of continuous exposure to the wastewater as acute and approximation of chronic effect 57 the continuous aeration of swine wastewater decreases the toxicity effect over bacteria for both periods of exposure considered table 2 for 4 h of aeration comparing to the initial wastewater no changes were possible to observe on the luminescence inhibition at these periods the same light inhibition is determined for both cases of exposure 15 or 30 min this means that the application of this wastewater without any treatment on the agriculture soils can be problematic for the aquatic species this reduction can be related with the ammonium nh4 n removal since during the aeration step it is possible to remove these compounds 4 in fact 72 h of aeration lead to the depletion of about 120 10 mg l of tkn meanwhile a high luminescence inhibition is observed when the bacteria is exposed during 30 min which means that the chronic effect of this wastewater could be nefarious for bacteria this can also be related with the higher chronic effect of ammonia in the aquatic species even at low concentrations 17 58 12 days of swine wastewater in contact with air improves significantly the toxicity reduction although the value 33 4 obtained for 15 min of exposure remains slightly higher comparing with the nontoxic value of 30 of luminescence inhibition 55 the coagulant concentration selected to analyse the toxicity regarding to bacteria was the 40 mg l since this value led to the best cod removal however the toxicity does not follow the same behaviour the coagulation step does not improve significantly the toxicity of swine wastewater in fact the luminescence inhibition was 88 3 and 87 9 for 15 and 30 min of exposure table 2 respectively for the treated sample this value is still very high and this can be related with the low removal obtained for tkn with this kind of processes riaño and garcía gonzález 33 using a coagulation and flocculation step just removed about 22 of tkn and the ammonium does not suffer any modification on the other hand the clams allow the reduction of toxicity on bacteria the ratio 1 150 submitted to 4 h of biofiltration led to a sample that provoked a light inhibition of 66 5 and 65 4 for 15 and 30 min of exposure table 2 respectively this decrease can be related to the higher cod removal and even the possibility of clams to removing some antibiotics present in the swine wastewater 20 3 3 2 lepidium sativum the toxicity assessment using cress is an indirect way to prove that the treated and untreated wastewater can be applied on agriculture soils in fact this wastewater presents high phytotoxicity regarding to l sativum after 48 h of this initial swine wastewater in contact with the cress seeds no germination was possible to observe minimal germination was observed through swine wastewater after 24 and 48 h of aeration with values mean se around 4 2 and 9 6 respectively however this can be expected since the cod removal efficiency was very low besides the high cod removal and low bacteria toxicity of aeration after 288 h the germination index obtained for the same conditions indicates that the treated effluent remains very phytotoxic for these conditions it was possible to obtain a germination index of 22 15 according to the trautmann and krasny 31 criteria this value represents a severe phytotoxicity one of the reasons for this low germination can be related with the presence of metals such as cu and zn in fact these metals can affect the growth of plants 4 the coagulation step promotes a germination index of 6 4 however with this methodology it should be removed a high amount of metals 33 therefore the tkn and organic matter presence could be the reason for this low germination the biofiltration during 4 h ratio 1 150 presents the best result in terms of the germination index achieving about 27 17 for clams it is difficult to find a reason for such low germination but can be related with the tkn presence and the remaining organic matter the metals can also be removed by the clams 24 meanwhile these results clearly indicate that this swine wastewater must be submitted to additional treatments before discharge in the agriculture fields considering this it is important to look for the accumulation of some contaminant elements onto the soil that can be prejudicial for plants 4 conclusions the increase on the pork meat consumption will create higher amount of swine wastewater and with an even more complex composition which will difficult such polluted streams remediation the conventional swine wastewater treatment needs to be improved due to its ineffectiveness therefore in this work it was suggested a new way to remove the organic matter and promote the solid liquid separation comparing with the traditional coagulation process biofiltration seems to be a suitable solution since it allows the reduction of cod values and even the toxicity comparing to single aeration and coagulation in fact this could be a low cost approach for pre treatment of the swine wastewater moreover the possibility of clam s reuse will minimize their disposal management costs the usage of clams can result in a suitable pre treatment for biological process and or for advanced oxidation process depending on needs declaration of competing interest the authors report no

13448,the increase on pork meat demand is consequently leading to higher production of swine wastewater these wastewaters are problematic due to their high organic matter load and nutrients content that can promote soil and aquatic sources contamination the conventional effluents treatment technologies seem to be inefficient for total organic matter and contaminants removal while demanding high retention times one of the steps considered for the swine wastewater treatment is solid liquid separation in this work coagulation using polydadmac was evaluated and the effect of the coagulant concentration for this purpose was tested this methodology was compared with an innovative approach involving biofiltration through the invasive bivalve corbicula fluminea the effects of the liquid to clam s ratio was assessed as well as the mechanism of organic matter removal and the clams reuse capacity the best chemical oxygen demand cod removal obtained was 51 using 1 l of effluent per 150 clams moreover it was possible to reuse the clams during 4 cycles without losing significant efficiency on the cod removal moreover the toxicity of the treated wastewater was evaluated regarding aliivibrio fischeri and lepidium sativum aeration without clams reduced the toxicity levels however for lepidium sativum germination index the best result was obtained for the wastewater treated by clams thus c fluminea presents potential for swine wastewater treatment keywords swine wastewater coagulation biofiltration corbicula fluminea toxicity assessment 1 introduction swine wastewater is typically composed by faeces and urine as well as wash waters which contain a high amount of straws and animal food the composition of swine wastewater is highly dependent upon the pig species animal food composition and the swinery washing system 1 this wastewater is also characterized by high organic matter concentration and great amount of nutrients such as nitrogen n and phosphorous p since the pigs cannot absorb them in their digestion system 2 heavy metals can be found such as cu and zn as well as antibiotics 3 4 therefore the excretions of pigs increase the presence of these contaminants in water and soils promoting water eutrophication and greenhouse gas emissions 5 moreover the conventional swine wastewater treatments are usually inefficient for high organic matter and nutrients concentrations removal requiring high retention times 2 in fact these treatments can remove part of the organic matter but presents high inefficiency for the inorganic nitrogen and phosporous removal 6 7 on the other hand pig meat demand increases the need for this animal intensive production this leads to the increase of antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals consumption as well as the swine wastewater loads the streams resulting from the swine production are increasingly more complex and fuller of refractory contaminants such as antibiotics 2 6 7 this also means an increase of water consumption which is a problem due to the water scarcity concern therefore water reuse within the swinery should be promoted the structures used to pork production limit the animal space and to prevent diseases that can be catastrophic due to the animal proximity an increasing on the antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals used has been observed 8 9 the presence of these pharmaceutical compounds in the wastewater is problematic since the conventional wastewater treatments cannot remove them efficiently 10 the swine wastewater could be prejudicial for human health and aquatic species additionally its disposal in the agriculture farms increases water contamination due to the soils leaching despite the pharmaceutical compounds the high organic matter should also be problematic for plants and seeds germination due the inherent high toxicity 4 the traditional treatment of swine wastewater requires space due to the high retention times required in the processes that include solid liquid separation aerobic lagoons and or anaerobic digestion 11 12 nowadays it is important to find suitable solutions for reducing the space requirements to achieve an efficient treatment one of the initial steps could be the removal of solids from the liquid phase the coagulation process could be an appropriate methodology for this achievement the coagulant will neutralize the charges producing bridges between solid particles the solid aggregated particles then can be removed by sedimentation filtration or flotation 12 typically the liquid phase resulting from this process presents low amount of nitrogen and phosphorous 12 gabriel et al 13 applied a tannin organic coagulant for swine wastewater treatment and achieved an effective reduction of turbidity polydadmac is a high charge density cationic polymer widely used in the coagulation flocculation systems of drinking water and wastewater treatment 14 15 corbicula fluminea is a filter feeder that can uptake store and excrete chemical compounds 16 17 the resistance of these clams under adverse conditions and the biofiltration capacity make this species a suitable option for bioremediation of water and wastewater 18 20 some studies can be found regarding their application for organic matter removal from winery and olive mill wastewater 21 23 moreover these clams could also be employed for metal elements removal 24 also their efficiency for disinfection removal of bacteria virus and protozoa was already proven 25 28 however the mechanism used by the clams for contaminants removal can influence their final destination 19 in fact some of these compounds can be accumulated in the tissues or even in the valve shells 23 28 to the best of our knowledge no studies were performed with invasive bivalves for real swine wastewater treatment the application of c fluminea for swine wastewater depuration may be envisaged as a new pest management approach since these bivalves need to be controlled due to their invasive character 29 the present work studied the number of clam s effect on the organic removal as well as the mechanism involved in biofiltration and the possibility of clam s reuse these results were compared with coagulation process using different concentrations as well as the coagulant addition method furthermore in order to ensure a safe disposal of the treated wastewater the toxicity of the treated solutions was compared with the initial swine wastewater over two species aliivibrio fischeri and lepidium sativum considering this is the first time of such broadly study using clams as biofilters aiming at reducing organic matter and toxicity impact using two different species 2 material and methods 2 1 swine wastewater for these experiments a real wastewater was collected from a swine farmer located in the center region of portugal this wastewater was taken concentrated from the outlet of the swine farmer production at the collection day no cleaning was performed at the swinery this means that the wastewater is highly concentrated usually a ratio of 1 12 5 of wastewater per cleaning water is applied at the swinery thus in order to have a more representative sample the collected wastewater was diluted accordingly for this dilution the initial characterization of swine wastewater is presented in table 1 the considered parameters were chemical oxygen demand cod total solids ts total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn and ph 2 2 coagulation experiments polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride polydadmac as a highly charged cationic polymer was applied for swine wastewater coagulation to separate the solid fraction from the liquid phase in the coagulation tests a certain volume of a 0 1 polydadmac stock solution was added to 200 ml of wastewater during a first stage of fast stirring 140 5 rpm for 3 min followed by 15 min of slow stirring 35 5 rpm to facilitate solids agglomeration after 30 min of sedimentation supernatant s samples were taken for further chemical analysis the effect of coagulant loading 10 60 mg l was studied to determine the optimum conditions additionally the effect of partially adding the coagulant instead of the initial addition of the overall amount was studied the partial addition was made in two stages and while the first one serves to destabilize the mixture the second one allows a better aggregation of destabilized particles which can enhance the removal of solids from the liquid phase the experiments were performed in a jar test equipment 2 3 biofiltration experiments the swine wastewater treatment by corbicula fluminea was made in 500 ml glass biofilters these tests were carried out at 20 c under a photoperiod cycle 16 h light 8 h dark and continuous aeration the clams were kept in dechlorinated water for about one week where the water was changed every two days the clams were collected from a canal in mira portugal n40 25 06 90 w8 44 13 18 where a well established population density above 2000 clams m2 exists this canal is composed by standing water with a great accumulation of organic matter and enteric pathogens due to this it was necessary an initial biodepuration of enteric pathogens and organic matter to avoid disturbing the clam s performance on the swine wastewater treatment the tests were performed in duplicate with different ratios of clams per liter of swine wastewater from 1 20 to 1 150 individuals with shell length in the range 20 30 mm were selected to perform these experiments to control the effect of the clams on the swine wastewater treatment and to bear in mind the aerobic degradation of the effluent through microorganisms a glass biofilter with the wastewater in duplicate was maintained at the same conditions but without clams moreover to validate the test a blank with dechlorinated water was placed with the clams samples were taken for chemical oxygen demand cod analysis at different times from 2 until 24 h the clam s mortality was also measured mortality of clams was verified at each time by checking if there was evidence of siphoning activity or if clams were closed by measuring resistance when forcing valve opening 15 to guarantee that the cod from the swine wastewater was removed by biofiltration and not just by adsorption experiments with the clam s empty shell were performed moreover the cod with aeration was also measured as well as 5 min after turning off the aeration since the particles during the bubbling can be dispersed in the biofilter the reuse of clams for the swine wastewater treatment was also analyzed for that clams were used for biofiltration during 4 h and after this they were placed in dechlorinated tap water during 20 h and then putted again in contact with fresh swine wastewater this procedure was repeated during 3 times to assure the capacity of clams to be recovered and applied again moreover the presence of air could be important to the aerobic bacteria that exists in the wastewater and may promote the cod aerobic biodegradation therefore the wastewater in contact with the air along one week was also analysed 2 4 analytical methods the concentration of organic matter from the swine wastewater was followed through the chemical oxygen demand cod quantification only soluble and colloidal cod was measured since the swine wastewater contains a high amount of straws and hay which precipitate quickly therefore the cod samples were measured after 5 min of precipitation cod was determined according to the standard method 5220d 30 this consists in the addition of a digestion solution k2cr2o7 an acidic solution h2so4 and ag2so4 and the sample each solution was tested in duplicate and with a control using distilled water instead of the sample absorbance values after 2 h of digestion at 150 c eco25 velp scientifica were measured at 605 nm in a wtw photolab s6 potassium hydrogen phthalate obtained from panreac was used to prepare a calibration curve with cod values within the range 100 4500 mg o2 l ph was determined using a crison microph 2002 apparatus 2 5 toxicity assessment before toxicity evaluation it was necessary to correct the ph of some samples to values within the range 6 5 7 5 the required ph was obtained by adding sodium hydroxide or sulfuric acid solutions to the samples this is important since the ph can affect the toxicity evaluation the luminescence inhibition was measured as an indicator of the toxicity of the samples towards aliivibrio fischeri using a lumistox 300 apparatus dr lange the organisms were exposed to untreated and treated samples after different treatment conditions at 15 c luminescence was measured after 15 min and 30 min and compared with a blank where bacteria were placed in a culture media solution 2 nacl solution to evaluate the phytotoxicity of the initial and treated effluents the number of germinated seeds and the radicle growth of l sativum were determined to calculate the germination index gi 31 the experiments were run in duplicate the petri dishes filled with the samples and seeds were placed in the oven for 48 h at constant temperature of 27 c then the number of seeds germinated and the radicle growth of each one was recorded germination index gi is the product of relative seed germination rsg by relative radicle growth rrg as in eqs 1 3 1 gi rsg x rrg 100 2 rsg n sg t n sg b x 100 3 rrg l r t l r b x 100 where nsg t and nsg b are the arithmetic means of the number of seeds germinated for each sample and blank with distilled water respectively lr t and lr b correspond to the average radicle length for each sample and blank respectively moreover due to the low number of germinated seeds in some experiments the exposure time was extended until 72 h 3 results and discussion 3 1 coagulation experiments swine wastewater is characterized by high content of total solids therefore the coagulation of this wastewater is crucial for solid liquid separation meanwhile to minimize the operation costs it is important to find the optimal coagulant concentration for these experiments different amounts of coagulant from 10 to 60 mg l were selected moreover the effect of the partial addition was analyzed for the 3 highest concentrations of coagulant in this case the addition of coagulant was made in two stages half load in each addition fig 1 shows the cod removal after each coagulation experiment the coagulation of swine wastewater clearly enhanced cod removal for the best results it was possible to remove about 40 of cod in fact the increase of concentration until 40 mg l enhances cod removal while for 60 mg l a further effect is almost negligible on the other hand the effect of coagulation regarding the total cod removal efficiency was about 80 for 40 mg l due to the initial high amount of solids such as straws and hays that easily sediment the results will only be analyzed in terms of soluble cod removal to be more comparable the partial addition slightly increases the cod removal for the 20 30 and 40 mg l but for 60 mg l it does not promote any modification when compared with 40 mg l the main objective of coagulation is the removal of solids from the liquid phase the effect of the coagulant load was also determined for total solids ts depletion in this regard the concentration of coagulant does not present a significant impact contrarily to what happens to cod for 30 mg l it was possible to remove 50 8 of initial ts whereas for 40 and 60 mg l 51 7 and 51 5 were removed respectively this negligible difference can be related with the presence of particles of high size that can be easily removed even with low coagulant concentration moreover the 60 mg l case presents an insignificant decrease in the ts removal efficiency which can be related with the excess of the coagulant for this wastewater the excess of coagulant can destabilize the particles again and difficult sedimentation gonzález fernández et al 32 applied 200 mg l of polyacrylamide cationic to remove about 39 of soluble cod from swine wastewater moreover using 186 mg l of another polyacrylamide led to a soluble cod removal of 31 33 hong et al 34 studied different concentrations of polyaluminium chloride pac from 50 to 300 mg l of coagulant and achieved an optimum for cod removal about 66 with a dose of 250 mg l when fecl3 was used as coagulant the authors verified that the removal of pollutants was a function of coagulant dosage and the highest values were obtained using a fe3 dosage of 150 mg as fe l subsequently the addition of fecl3 resulted in higher cod removal compared with using the pac as a coagulant these results are in accordance with the cod removal obtained in the present study however it must be pointed out the low amount of coagulant used in our study compared with those found in the literature which can mean a reduction on the cost for coagulation step 3 2 biofiltration 3 2 1 effect of exposure time despite the resistance to adverse conditions the exposure time of clams to swine wastewater can be problematic the clams when subjected to the adverse conditions due the presence of toxic compounds or high organic loads can close their valves as protective behavior 35 on the other hand if the conditions are adverse the clams may not resist which will promote the clam s mortality 15 therefore the effect of time on the cod removal and the clam s mortality during 24 h was analyzed the swine wastewater natural degradation was also observed since the presence of microorganisms naturally present in the wastewater with air can promote the aerobic digestion of organic matter the sedimentation of small particles along the day could also decrease the cod value this effect was analyzed by bubbling air to repeat the conditions with the clams and the air increases the dissolved oxygen which would promote the activity of aerobic microorganisms enhancing the degradation of biological organic matter fig 2 compares cod removal along time for biofiltration and aeration only the times selected to take samples for clams experiment were 4 6 and 24 h for this experiment the ratio of 1 100 l per clams was used on the first period from 4 to 6 h of exposure it was possible to observe an increase of 6 on the cod removal from 39 to 45 moreover no mortality was observed and the clams presented good aspect since high siphoning activity was detected 35 36 however the continuous exposure to swine wastewater from 6 to 24 h promoted a decrease on the clam s efficiency regarding cod removal compared to the previous period this impact could be related with the presence of ammonia that can be prejudicial for the clams lethal concentration lc50 for ammonia in 96 h of exposure is about 84 mg l 37 in fact at the end of this period a clam s mortality of about 5 was obtained still this value is very low which reveals the resistance of clams to this wastewater moreover the other clams present a closed valve behavior and the remaining also show abnormal foot extension and paralysis unresponsiveness to prodding this specific response of clams can be related with the ions in the swine wastewater lellis et al 38 verified this response of clams with either tight close of the valves or gapping in the presence of potassium ions on the other hand the cod increase that was detected can be related with the physiology activity of clams to release urine and feaces to the water therefore the time selected for undertaking experiments with the clams was 4 h despite of the high cod removal at 6 h the difference was not so sharp and the increase of contact time for further real application means higher volume biofilters the experiment without clams and with bubbling air reveals also the natural potential of microorganisms for cod removal fig 2 however the time scale was totally different one of the methodologies used for swine wastewater treatment is the aerobic lagoons after the solid liquid separation 12 despite of the low solubility of oxygen the air bubbling promoted the presence of higher concentrations of dissolved oxygen this will enhance the aerobic activity of microorganisms on the removal of organic matter in fact after 12 days of aeration the cod removal was about 85 fig 2 however due to the limitation and restrictions of space for the pork production demand regarding to swine wastewater treatment it is important to find suitable alternatives for the decrease on the wastewater treatment time and volume the presence of microorganisms from pig s intestinal tract is a reality that can come at the faeces 39 therefore if the high organic matter persists in the swine wastewater can be related with the indigestible residues that will be slow biodegraded by the microbial community 40 the 12 days or more seems to be enough for microbial community provided by pig s intestinal tract bioprocess great part of organic matter present in the swine wastewater still this implies a high retention treatment time leading to large volumes for the reactors which may not be suitable for all pork production farms 3 2 2 effect of the number of clams corbicula fluminea presents a high capacity to promote the removal of organic matter from the water through biofiltration in this case the swine wastewater is composed by a high amount of nutrients and organic matter that can be biofiltrated by this specie in fact the clams can feed from this kind of wastewater if the toxicity is not so high the mortality of the clams registered for high ratio 1 l per 100 clams tested during 24 h of contact with the swine wastewater was low therefore the clams seem suitable for swine wastewater treatment regarding cod removal in order to analyze the impact of the number of clams on the treatment efficiency the biofiltration experiments were conducted during 4 h fig 3 shows the cod removed after 4 h for different liquid to clam s number ratios as it can be expected the number of clams can affect the cod removal the increase on the number of clams per liter of swine wastewater improves the cod removal ratio in fig 3 l number of clams the typical ratio used in the bioremediation experiments for these clams is 1 20 22 23 gomes et al 28 verified for escherichia coli removal that the increase on the clam s ratio from 1 40 to 1 60 does not increase the efficiency however this could be related with the low initial e coli concentration on the other hand for this swine wastewater the cod value after the biofiltration even with the higher ratio is still high the ratio 1 100 presents a similar result to the one obtained for coagulation experiments with the best conditions meanwhile the ratio 1 150 improves the degradation of the organic matter since the cod removal that was obtained was about 51 in 4 h the final cod value obtained was 2 15 0 30 g l still this cod value is higher than the one permitted for the discharge in aquatic systems 0 15 g l of cod according to the national regulation decree law no 236 98 ferreira et al 22 after 24 h of 1 20 clams ratio exposure reached a cod value about 0 3 g l in winery wastewater with initial cod around 2 g l however it must be considered the high difference between the tested wastewaters composition in fact it was proved the biofiltering capacity of clams to the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons silva et al 2016 which can be detected in the winery wastewater the efficiency differences between biofitration and coagulation are related with the capacity of the clams to remove soluble nutrients and other chemicals such as antibiotics and other organic matter while coagulation acts mainly on suspended and colloidal solids removal the clams due to the high biofiltration capacity can be used for controlling the eutrophication in water reservoirs 41 on the other hand the application of invasive bivalves for pharmaceutical and personal care products has been studied 20 42 gomes et al 20 proved that clams can promote the biofiltration of antibiotics such as sulfamethoxazole smx this antibiotic can be typically found in swine wastewaters 2 therefore the application of clams for cod removal should be a suitable option since these species promote a great contaminants reduction without addition of any chemical to the wastewater 3 2 3 mechanism of cod removal it is clear the effect of the clams on cod removal for all the ratios tested fig 3 but for the highest ratio 1 l 150 clams this value exceeds the efficiency obtained with coagulation through the cationic coagulant thus it is important to understand the mechanism behind the clams biofiltration capability for cod removal one of the capacities of the clams is the possibility of adsorbing the contaminants on the shells 23 24 on the other hand the biofiltration process of clams can result in the biotransformation of lipophilic into hydrophilic metabolites to be excreted 43 moreover the contaminants that cannot be processed by the clams could be also released as a pseudofeaces 23 in this study the cod removal by clam s shell adsorption was tested using empty clams without soft tissue and after drying during 24 h at 105 c this drying is to assure the complete removal of water from the shell the shells were placed with the valves slightly open which increases the area of adsorption the ratio 1 80 clams was tested for the empty clams and the cod removed was about 8 0 2 during 4 h this removal is much lower compared to the one obtained for the live clams where for the same ratio and treatment time it was possible to obtain 30 1 7 for the same period with aeration and without clams the natural cod removal was about 2 1 1 8 comparing this result with the one obtained for the clam s shells it is possible to see a slight improvement on the cod removal which means that a small amount of organic matter was adsorbed on the shell therefore the live clams can promote the efficient biofiltration of organic matter another feature can be the pseudofaeces formation during the biofiltration process pseudofaeces are related with the biofiltered compounds that were not processed by the clam s gill and were rejected and expelled by exhalant siphon involved by a mucous produced on the demibranchs 44 this behavior is a protection of clams against chemical contaminants on these experiments it was possible to observe the mucous production since during biofiltration the solid particles were aggregated by this material the aggregation obtained by this mucous production results on a higher particle sedimentation this can be considered a double action by the clams since this mucous can act as a natural coagulant the second one since the biofiltration presents higher cod removal compared with the coagulation process seems to be related with the biofiltering of some contaminants and organic matter present in the swine wastewater 3 2 4 clams reuse the use of these invasive bivalves on this approach can be seen as an attractive pest management strategy since the traditional one consists on their control by chlorination 45 however the application of these methodologies results on the formation of organochlorinated compounds thus the recourse to a suitable pest management strategy is fundamental to reduce the environmental and economic impact resulting from these invasive bivalves in the ecosystems 29 in fact the biofilters assembly can be integrated with the physical removal of the bivalves from the invaded sites reducing the transport costs the clams reuse during four cycles was analyzed to attest the possibility to continue employing the same clams during several batches rather than removing them and using new ones each time this will allow to manage the clam s usage during more time one of the major drawbacks of using these clams is the transference from the infested sites for the biofilters assembling 19 the possibility of reusing the clams to remove the organic matter from the swine wastewater would reduce the transportation costs moreover these costs could be minimal if the physical removal of the clams from infested sites was coordinated with the biofilter assembling 29 the clams ratio of 1 150 were submitted to 4 h of contact with swine wastewater and then placed during 20 h in dechlorinated tap water this time period will assure that clams are all alive and with good siphoning activity the siphoning activity could be a signal of health and or stress 46 some authors analyze the siphoning behavior by dye removal 47 or by microalgae removal 35 in this study the siphoning activity was observed through the biofilter direct observation and on the cod removal the 4 h of treatment were selected based on the previous results that shown that using 24 h lead to a worst efficiency and higher mortality it should be referred that during these four cycles no clam s mortality was registered at the first reuse cod removal decreased significantly from 51 to 20 fig 4 this means that in this first period the clams are more apprehensive due to the previous contact with the effluent the animals present a protective behavior with the reduction on the siphoning activity contrarily to what happens at the first exposure this low response can be associated with the ammonia accumulation in the tissue which reduces the oxygen exchange and feeding 46 on the other hand the clams could decrease the filtration rates without valve closure behavior 47 in our study it was verified a valve closure behavior for a high amount of the clams indicating the protective response of clams against swine wastewater from the first reuse the clams started to improve the cod removal efficiency for the remaining reuse cycles tested this improvement can be related with the adaptation of clams to the adverse conditions 17 48 the hunger of clams could also be one of the reasons since the clams were not fed during the reuse cycles to not interfere on the biofiltration capacity 23 in fact the first use of the clams was made after a starvation period of about two weeks here it was possible to observe the hunger of clams that lead to higher cod removal on the other hand the two last cycles do not seem to be related with the fact of clams were not fed since at the last reuse cycle the clams enhance the cod removal efficiency comparing to the previous one moreover during the depuration step the clams excrete high amounts of faeces in the dechlorinated tap water this is a sign that clams can bioprocess part of the organic matter biofiltered from swine wastewater therefore according to these results the clams seem to be able to adapt at adverse medium and can survive promoting the biofiltration activity to organic matter removal after proving the biofiltration capacity and the reusability it is important to deal with the contaminated and or dead animals the traditional wastewater treatment also must manage the biosolids provided from the activated sludge 19 here it is also important to find a solution for the clam s disposal one of the most applied methodologies for the swine wastewater is the anaerobic digestion 49 meanwhile some studies can be found revealing the low efficiency of this method on the wastewater treatment due to the high organic loading rates 50 51 consequently the application of biofiltration before anaerobic digestion to remove part of the organic matter can be suitable moreover the dead clam s tissue can also contribute for the anaerobic digestion since this material can be a source of biodegradable organic matter 40 thus anaerobic digestion can be a method to manage the wasted clams after biofiltration moreover in accordance with the obtained results the high final cod value does not allow the wastewater discharge in water sources and the biofiltration can work as a pretreatment of such complex wastewater therefore the biofiltration can be applied before anaerobic digestion which is one of the most used technologies for swine wastewater treatment however if the aim is to obtain a better quality treatment in lower time biofiltration may precede an advanced oxidation process application such as fenton ozone or electrochemical oxidation 52 53 3 3 toxicity assessment one of the most common final destinations of this type of wastewater is the agriculture soil 54 however the continuous disposal of untreated streams will promote the contamination of ground and surface water due to the leaching of the contaminants 54 the use of a pre treatment such as coagulation and biofiltration may reduce the environmental impact of the swine wastewater the impacts of raw and treated wastewater on bacteria was evaluated this analysis is relevant to infer about the potential of surface water contamination related for example with the presence of antibiotics in swine wastewater 2 on the other hand considering the application of this wastewater on soil its effect on the germination of cress was evaluated the treated solutions by clams ratio 1 150 and coagulation 40 mg l were compared with the samples coming from simple aeration during different periods of time 3 3 1 aliivibrio fischeri these bacteria are very sensitive under adverse conditions 55 56 the initial swine wastewater leads to a luminescence inhibition li related to the control of 92 10 0 3 for both exposure periods considered 15 and 30 min table 2 these periods were selected to check the effect of continuous exposure to the wastewater as acute and approximation of chronic effect 57 the continuous aeration of swine wastewater decreases the toxicity effect over bacteria for both periods of exposure considered table 2 for 4 h of aeration comparing to the initial wastewater no changes were possible to observe on the luminescence inhibition at these periods the same light inhibition is determined for both cases of exposure 15 or 30 min this means that the application of this wastewater without any treatment on the agriculture soils can be problematic for the aquatic species this reduction can be related with the ammonium nh4 n removal since during the aeration step it is possible to remove these compounds 4 in fact 72 h of aeration lead to the depletion of about 120 10 mg l of tkn meanwhile a high luminescence inhibition is observed when the bacteria is exposed during 30 min which means that the chronic effect of this wastewater could be nefarious for bacteria this can also be related with the higher chronic effect of ammonia in the aquatic species even at low concentrations 17 58 12 days of swine wastewater in contact with air improves significantly the toxicity reduction although the value 33 4 obtained for 15 min of exposure remains slightly higher comparing with the nontoxic value of 30 of luminescence inhibition 55 the coagulant concentration selected to analyse the toxicity regarding to bacteria was the 40 mg l since this value led to the best cod removal however the toxicity does not follow the same behaviour the coagulation step does not improve significantly the toxicity of swine wastewater in fact the luminescence inhibition was 88 3 and 87 9 for 15 and 30 min of exposure table 2 respectively for the treated sample this value is still very high and this can be related with the low removal obtained for tkn with this kind of processes riaño and garcía gonzález 33 using a coagulation and flocculation step just removed about 22 of tkn and the ammonium does not suffer any modification on the other hand the clams allow the reduction of toxicity on bacteria the ratio 1 150 submitted to 4 h of biofiltration led to a sample that provoked a light inhibition of 66 5 and 65 4 for 15 and 30 min of exposure table 2 respectively this decrease can be related to the higher cod removal and even the possibility of clams to removing some antibiotics present in the swine wastewater 20 3 3 2 lepidium sativum the toxicity assessment using cress is an indirect way to prove that the treated and untreated wastewater can be applied on agriculture soils in fact this wastewater presents high phytotoxicity regarding to l sativum after 48 h of this initial swine wastewater in contact with the cress seeds no germination was possible to observe minimal germination was observed through swine wastewater after 24 and 48 h of aeration with values mean se around 4 2 and 9 6 respectively however this can be expected since the cod removal efficiency was very low besides the high cod removal and low bacteria toxicity of aeration after 288 h the germination index obtained for the same conditions indicates that the treated effluent remains very phytotoxic for these conditions it was possible to obtain a germination index of 22 15 according to the trautmann and krasny 31 criteria this value represents a severe phytotoxicity one of the reasons for this low germination can be related with the presence of metals such as cu and zn in fact these metals can affect the growth of plants 4 the coagulation step promotes a germination index of 6 4 however with this methodology it should be removed a high amount of metals 33 therefore the tkn and organic matter presence could be the reason for this low germination the biofiltration during 4 h ratio 1 150 presents the best result in terms of the germination index achieving about 27 17 for clams it is difficult to find a reason for such low germination but can be related with the tkn presence and the remaining organic matter the metals can also be removed by the clams 24 meanwhile these results clearly indicate that this swine wastewater must be submitted to additional treatments before discharge in the agriculture fields considering this it is important to look for the accumulation of some contaminant elements onto the soil that can be prejudicial for plants 4 conclusions the increase on the pork meat consumption will create higher amount of swine wastewater and with an even more complex composition which will difficult such polluted streams remediation the conventional swine wastewater treatment needs to be improved due to its ineffectiveness therefore in this work it was suggested a new way to remove the organic matter and promote the solid liquid separation comparing with the traditional coagulation process biofiltration seems to be a suitable solution since it allows the reduction of cod values and even the toxicity comparing to single aeration and coagulation in fact this could be a low cost approach for pre treatment of the swine wastewater moreover the possibility of clam s reuse will minimize their disposal management costs the usage of clams can result in a suitable pre treatment for biological process and or for advanced oxidation process depending on needs declaration of competing interest the authors report no

13449,the health of human beings is threatened by drug resistant diseases due to excessive antibiotic use a promising cost competitive water disinfection technology is photocatalytic disinfection in this study ag doped ni0 5zn0 5fe2o4 photosensitive catalyst ag d nzf was synthesized for disinfection of metronidazole antibiotic and bacteria contaminated water ag d nzf was characterized and results revealed it has a bandgap of 2 96 ev exhibiting a stable photocurrent response of 1 36 μa cm 2 with a crystallite size of 15 3 nm and crystallinity of 74 5 after 360 min of uv assisted irradiation under optimal conditions ph 3 and 7 mm h2o2 10 mg ag d nzf degraded 99 9 of 50 mgl 1 mz with an apparent rate constant of 0 0103 min 1 ag d nzf maintained 75 2 80 9 efficiency in the presence of interfering ions and tylosin antibiotic after 65 min 25 mg of ag d nzf demonstrated bactericidal effects 100 inactivation in the dark and under uv light against e coli and s aureus respectively the electrical energy consumed per order revealed that uv ag d nzf h2o2 required 26 84 kw h to degrade mz which is equivalent to 1 34 per m3 of mz a plausible photocatalytic degradation mechanism was established in which o2 was the dominant radical while oh radicals and h contributed moderately to the decomposition processes keywords ternary photocatalyst metronidazole uv induced photodegradation bacterial inactivation ag doped ni zn ferrites 1 introduction antibiotics are used to prevent or treat some forms of bacterial infection for decades saving millions of lives and ensuring longevity metronidazole mz is one of the most widely used antibiotics to treat anaerobic bacterial infections various protozoa giardia infections in dogs cats and sometimes combined with poultry and fish feeds to facilitate weight production 1 4 increased intake of mz its high solubility 10 mg l 1 at 25 c in water and emission of its residues and metabolites result in its saturation in the environment 2 5 the cytotoxic intermediates released from mz have the potential to damage organisms dna membranes and proteins 3 4 particularly mz has been confirmed to be genotoxic to humans and may have carcinogenic and mutagenic effects on aquatic species 5 the removal of mz residues and metabolites from aqueous environments is therefore crucial because antibiotic resistance induced by excessive consumption of antibiotics is an increasing global health hazard that leads to higher medical costs and increased mortality 5 6 at least 700 000 people die yearly because of drug resistant diseases according to the world health organization 7 and in the united states cdc reported that at least 30 000 deaths resulted from antibiotic resistant diseases annually 8 to curtail this threatening hazard different approaches have been used so far to decontaminate mz laden effluents 1 6 9 12 conventional biological methods are time consuming ineffective for mz degradation and generate high sludge 9 12 also mz is not destroyed in physical processes such as adsorption rather it is transferred from a liquid phase to the adsorbent phase and often cause secondary pollution semiconductor based photocatalysis is a promising cost competitive technology for the treatment of wastewater contaminated by antibiotics that enables the use of ultraviolet and direct sunlight to mineralize pseudo resistant organic pharmaceutical pollutants 1 6 in degrading a broad range of distinct contaminants into biodegradable substances heterogeneous photocatalysis using tio2 and zno has proven its effectiveness 3 2 6 although their applications are restricted due to the fast recombination rates of photogenerated carriers and wide energy bandgap 13 14 recent research has shown that spinel ni zn ferrites can be used as a photocatalyst to decompose toxic organic compounds and as antibacterial agents during the treatment of wastewater 15 18 spinel ni zn ferrites are desirable for wastewater decontamination because of their small bandgap 2 2 5 ev intrinsic redox chemistry tunable electronic properties and topologically arranged metal sites 16 21 by solution combustion synthesis technique aali et al 21 synthesized ni0 5zn0 5fe2o4 photocatalyst and recorded 85 methylene blue dye photodegradation and 100 bacteria growth inhibition with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 0 25 mg ml 1 and 0 125 mg ml 1 ml against e coli and s aureus strains respectively nag et al 19 also successfully prepared ni0 5zn0 5fe2o4 polypyrrole nanocomposites by acid assisted in situ oxidative self polymerization technique 90 99 2 degradation was reported for methylene blue and rhodamine b dyes under visible light illumination after 40 min based on previous studies doping the photocatalyst with high conductivity metal ions such as ag au and pt induces highly efficient electron mobility and delays the recombination phase of photo generated electrons holes resulting in increased photocatalyst degradation activity 4 18 22 according to ahmad et al 4 with the incorporation of ag into the zno lattice crystal growth deteriorated with the decrease in crystallite size and suppression rate of the electron hole pair which significantly enhanced metronidazole degradation research on the environmental application of easily separable magnetic ag d ni0 5zn0 5fe2o4 photocatalyst is rare and there is a lack of information focusing on this novel material on the removal of antibiotics as well as bacterial inactivation to decrease human dependence on chlorine ag d ni0 5zn0 5fe2o4 is expected to have a very favourable outlook for the water treatment industry because it can degrade organics and inactivate bacterial strains in this study ag d ni0 5zn0 5fe2o4 ag d nzf photocatalyst was prepared by two step yet simple protocols for eliminating metronidazole antibiotic under uv irradiations the photocatalytic behaviour of ag d nzf was investigated under different conditions and in the presence of other antibiotics or salts as interference besides the antibacterial capacity of the ag d nzf was evaluated against gram positive and gram negative bacteria the high photocatalytic activity of the ag d nzf photocatalyst was discussed in detail based on the experimental results active species trapping and the theoretical estimation of the electronic structure 2 experimental 2 1 materials analytical

sodium hydroxide naoh hydrochloric acid hcl 35 ethanol and metronidazole mz 2 2 synthesis process of ag d ni0 5zn0 5fe2o4 firstly the ni0 5zn0 5fe2o4 nzf nanoparticles were prepared according to modified procedures previously published 14 21 specifically 5 5 g of znso4 7h2o 6 g of niso4 6h2o and 5 7 g of fecl3 6h2o were dissolved in 80 ml distilled water the solution was stirred continuously at 250 rpm until it became homogeneous then 20 ml of acetic acid 0 3 m was added to prevent aggregation afterwards the solution was transferred to an oil bath then stirred vigorously 800 rpm for 3 h at 80 c the cooled solution was dried at 80 c overnight then calcined at 800 c for 2 h in a muffle furnace washed severally with distilled water and dried secondly ag d nzf was prepared accordingly 5 g of nzf was mixed with 50 ml of 0 1 m agno3 and the mixture was stirred at 250 rpm for 45 min at room temperature afterwards the temperature was increased to 70 c and 30 ml of 75 mm naoh was added dropwise the suspension was stirred for another 1 h at 70 c then filtered and washed with water and 50 ethanol the final product was dried at 100 c for 24 h and labelled ag d ni0 5zn0 5fe2o4 2 3

40 kv and 30 ma the measurement was recorded at 2θ 5 0 at a rate of 2 min 1 and the crystalline phases were clarified using standard jcpds files the ag d nzf was characterized by uv vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy drs using a uv 2450 spectrometer shimadzu japan from 200 nm to 800 nm fourier transform infrared ftir spectra were recorded in the range 4000 400 cm 1 using an ftir 8700

assisted photocatalytic degradation of metronidazole ag d nzf photocatalytic activity was assessed by reacting with mz solutions in a batch type customized pyrex flask reactor stirred at 200 rpm under uv light 18 w 385 nm t8w5 china in each experiment the desired ag d nzf dose was dispersed in 25 ml of 50 mg l 1 mz solution which was then stirred for 30 min under darkness to achieve the adsorption desorption state before uv light irradiation the initial ph values of the solutions were adjusted with 0 1 m hcl naoh the photocatalytic performance of mz was examined by varying parameters such as ph 3 10 initial mz concentration 10 100 ppm oxidant concentration h2o2 k2s2o4 4 7 mm and dosage of ag d nzf 10 50 mg at the pre determined period the ag d nzf particles were separated from the solution using an external magnet 2 ml of the sample was taken and analyzed for residual mz concentration by uv vis spectroscopy t90 uv vis spectrophotometer pg instruments ltd uk at the λ max 320 nm with a 1 cm path length quartz cell the concentrations were calculated using a linear regression equation y 0 0375x 0 1967 obtained by plotting a calibration curve of mz absorption over a range of concentrations with r2 0 999 the spent photocatalyst was eluted by base spiked distilled water then dried at 40 c and repeatedly reused to investigate the stability and reusability of ag d nzf the trapping experiments were conducted to detect active species during the photocatalytic reaction similar to the procedure used for the photodegradation experiment 5 mm scavengers 1 4 benzoquinone bq tert butyl alcohol t buoh and sodium oxalate naox were added into the mz solution before the addition of the ag d nzf which are o2 oh so4 and h scavengers respectively 23 26 the catalytic activity of ag d nzf was also studied when 50 mg l 1 mz interfered with antibiotics 1 mg l 1 tylosin and tetracycline and various salts 0 1 m of nacl kno3 and na2so4 note the results of successive preliminary studies carried out with nzf were inconsistent and comparably lower than that of ag d nzf hence only the results of ag d nzf are reported 2 5 data analysis each experiment was performed twice and the

coli atcc 25922 were used to test the antimicrobial efficiency of ag d nzf via time kill assays s aureus and e coli cultures were incubated over night at 37 c in muller hinton agar mha biomerieux france and macconkey agar mca biomerieux france respectively the bacterial stock solutions were prepared in mueller hinton broth mhb merck germany and standardized using 0 5 mcfarland instrument 0 5 mcfarland 1 5 108 colony forming units per ml 5 25 mg of ag d nzf was mixed with bacterial solutions which were diluted to 1 107 cfu ml 1 using 50 ml of sterile saline solution the flasks containing the mixture were agitated in two separate cases at 200 rpm 1 h in the dark and 6 h in uv light as a control group flasks containing bacterial solutions without ag d nzf were used for comparison periodically 10 μl was withdrawn from all samples and diluted with 90 μl of mhb finally the diluted solutions were dropped into the agar plate and incubated at 37 c for 24 h the colonies were counted

ag d nzf in both spectra the bands corresponding to the characteristics stretching vibration of metal oxide mo skeleton are observed in the low frequency region of 700 65 cm 1 which is consistent with the ferrites spectrum 14 21 specifically the absorption bands in 597 578 cm 1 and 490 465 cm 1 are due to mtetra o and mocta o bonds respectively which are in agreement with the report of aali et al 21 for the nzf spectrum the obvious bands at 1145 983 cm 1 are due to asymmetric stretching of feom m ni or zn 27 after doping nzf with ag the broad peak at 599 cm 1 in nzf spectrum shifted slightly to 559 cm 1 and resulted in a sharp and strong peak the bands at 1145 983 cm 1 in nzf also deviated to 1158 1040 cm 1 and decreased in intensity in the ag d nzf spectrum which is possibly due to the transformation of the bond lengths as a result of ag doping onto nzf similarly for undoped zno to ag doped zno nanoparticles saravanadevi et al 28 observed a deviation of the absorption bands which were attributed to bond length transformation fig 1b represents the uv vis drs absorption spectra of the nzf and ag d nzf over 200 800 nm both samples exhibit strong absorption in the ultraviolet range particularly nzf shows absorption in the uv region 345 396 nm due to intrinsic band transitions between the m cations and m o2 consistent with other reports 18 21 the absorption edge of nzf is 392 nm while the ag d nzf wavelength region is extended into the visible region with an absorption edge at 419 nm and absorption enhancement around 450 580 nm which is attributed to the interaction of the localized d electrons of ag and s and p electron of the host nzf notably in the range of 200 450 nm the absorption intensity of ag d nzf is greater than that of nzf suggesting that it may possess better catalytic activity in the uv and visible regions fig 1c displays the light response profiles of the nzf and ag d nzf during multiple irradiations of on off light the photocurrent density increased rapidly when the irradiation light was activated for both samples then decreased to a constant value when the light was shut off noticeably ag d nzf demonstrated a photocurrent response of 1 36 μa cm 2 which is 1 7 times higher than that of nzf the samples optical band gap was determined in accordance with the classical tauc equation 6 α h v a h v e g n where α ν h eg n represent absorption coefficient light frequency planck s constant bandgap nature of transition and a is a constant associated with the valence and conduction bands the direct optical band gap of the samples was obtained by plotting αhν 2 vs hν the eg was calculated to be 2 96 ev and 2 99 ev for ag d nzf and nzf respectively the transition and recombination rate of the photogenerated charge carrier were examined by the photoluminescence pl technique as shown in fig 1d both samples had two emission bands around 360 470 nm the broad 390 nm emission originates from an exciton exciton collision mechanism from the recombination of the free excitons and is typically referred to as uv band edge emission 4 at 468 nm the broad blue emission band is possibly due to the direct recombination of electrons in cb and holes in vb 14 24 a weak green emission band was observed at 550 nm for ag d nzf which may be due to the presence of defects or oxygen vacancies the ag d nzf exhibited lower pl intensity in comparison with nzf note that the lower the pl intensity suggests the lower the recombination rate of e and h 25 29 therefore the integration of ag into the nzf enhanced the photoinduced e h pairs separation efficiency by forming a space region with the nzf while the charge carriers adjust themselves in such a way that the fermi level of nzf matched with ag s work function 4 fig 2 a shows sem micrographs of nzf and ag d nzf the ag d nzf has a spongy morphology with agglomerated irregular grain shapes when examined closely the agglomeration may be caused by the crystallites dipole interactions the grains have a wide size range with many appearing to be smaller than 5 μm the agglomeration is lower in nzf and some grain surfaces have hexagonal sections or cut edges in both samples which is the basic crystal cell of ferrites the chemical compositions of both nzf and ag d nzf were determined using energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx as shown in fig 2b and table 1 with no impurities found in the samples the experimental compositions are consistent with the expected stoichiometry of ni0 5zn0 5fe2o4 it s worth noting that the au and pd peaks in the spectra correspond to the metallic coater on which the samples were deposited the eis nyquist plots in fig 2c show the interface charge separation efficiency of the samples the radius of the arc represents the interfacial charge transfer resistance r ct a lower r ct value indicates that the photocatalyst s charge transfer efficiency is higher which corresponds to increased activity order the ag d nzf under uv exhibited the lowest diameter of the semi circle with an r ct value notably lower than that of nzf suggesting a greater separation of the photogenerated electron hole pairs and transfer efficiency which resulted in the highest photocatalytic activity towards degradation of mz the xrd pattern fig 3 of nzf displays the spinel structure of ni zn ferrite jcpds 52 0278 and jcpds 08 0234 with all major diffraction peaks corresponding to the standard pattern of ni0 5zn0 5fe2o4 at the position of 2θ 18 33 33 11 36 67 38 11 53 97 57 18 63 77 and 72 16 matching 111 220 311 400 422 511 440 and 533 miller indices 19 21 30 31 nzf has lattice parameters a b c 8 38 å and an estimated crystallinity of 66 8 similar diffraction peaks were observed in ag d nzf in addition to the distinct diffraction peaks of ag ions at 2θ 35 53 43 92 and 64 52 which corresponds to the 111 200 and 220 planes respectively 32 33 according to the debye scherrer equation d 0 9λ β cos θ the crystallite size of nzf and ag d nzf was obtained as 34 56 and 48 09 nm respectively the positions of the diffraction peaks are almost unaffected by ag doping however the intensity of the diffraction peaks are better separated in the ag d nzf also note that the ag d nzf exhibited higher crystallinity increased dislocation density and lower crystallite size than the nzf see table 1 this is because the ag monovalent dopant likely occupied both the interstitial and lattice sites of the nzf because of its higher ionic radius 1 26 å than zn2 0 74 and ni2 0 69 å hence increased the lattice strain of nzf 34 a similar observation was noted by sathya et al 33 when zno nanoparticles were doped with silver ion the textural characteristics of ag d nzf and nzf are given in table 1 according to the results and the bjh barrett joyner halenda pore size distribution the average pore diameter of ag d nzf is 2 45 nm suggesting that it contains both meso and micropores where the mesopores dominate with a mesopore volume which is 1 5 times that of nzf the ag d nzf surface area is noticeably lower than that of nzf which is likely due to the aggregation of small silver particles into larger bulk particles of ag during the preparation process ali et al 35 also found that doping ag onto a fealo sample reduced its surface area 3 2 evaluation of ag d nzf under varying conditions 3 2 1 solution ph effect a preliminary test was initially performed to determine the photocatalytic degradation of mz using 25 mg ag d nzf when the ph of 50 mgl 1 mz solution was varied in the absence and presence of 4 mm oxidants h2o2 or k2s2o8 the mz degradation trend when the solution ph was varied is attributed to the combination of ph dependent speciation of mz pka 2 5 36 and the surface chemistry of ag d nzf phpzc 7 0 fig 4 a without oxidant the ag d nzf degradation efficiency reached a maximum of 50 at ph 3 after 6 h uv irradiation in the ag d nzf h2o2 system mz degradation reached 78 9 at ph 3 while a decreasing trend was observed when the solution ph was increased beyond ph 3 and reached 14 6 at ph 9 at ph 3 ag d nzf k2s2o8 reached 49 6 and slightly increased to 52 6 at ph 9 fig 4b at ph 3 the anionic mz electron deficient species are dominant in the solution and are electrostatically attracted to the positively charged ag d nzf which resulted in higher degradation efficiency 1 3 36 at ph 9 repulsion occurred between the negatively charged ag d nzf and mz note that the so4 radicals generated from k2s2o8 are efficient at a broad ph while the direct contact between the generated oh radicals and the catalyst at the alkaline condition ph 9 could be hindered by the variety of hydroxyl surface complexes of ag d nzf which resulted to lower degradation efficiency 36 39 therefore subsequent studies were carried out at ph 3 3 2 2 variation in ag d nzf dosage and oxidant concentration fig 5 a shows the degradation efficiency of 50 mgl 1 mz and final concentration obtained after degradation process as the dosage of ag d nzf was varied at ph 3 without an oxidant the degradation efficiency decreased slightly from 90 1 to 86 8 with increasing ag d nzf dosage from 10 mg to 25 mg beyond 25 mg the degradation efficiency decreased remarkably to 79 when ag d nzf dosage was increased to 50 mg the observed decreasing trend in the degradation efficiency herein is likely due to either i increased suspension turbidity due to increased catalyst which resulted in decreases in penetration of uv light and efficiency of photoactivation 33 40 or ii the deactivation of photon activated ag d nzf species by collision with excess ag d nzf as the amount of catalyst increased in the suspension as shown in eq 7 also the aggregation of excess ag d nzf might decrease its effective surface area and adsorption of the mz species 40 7 a g d n z f a g d n z f e x c e s s a g d n z f α a g d n z f here ag d nzf and ag d nzfα represent the uv activated and the deactivated form of catalyst since the most efficient mz removal was observed at 10 mg ag d nzf per 25 ml of mz further testing was performed at this dose fig 5b shows the mz degradation efficiency and final concentration in the solution when the oxidants initial concentration were varied from 4 mm to 7 mm using 20 mg ag d nzf at solution ph 3 the mz degradation efficiency increased rapidly from 78 9 to 85 5 when h2o2 concentration was increased from 4 mm to 5 mm while the degradation efficiency only increased slightly to 88 2 at 7 mm h2o2 the increasing trend is associated with increases in the generation of oh radicals as the h2o2 concentration increased the initial mz concentration was 50 mgl 1 which decreased remarkably to 10 mgl 1 when 4 mm h2o2 was added to the solution and finally decreased to 5 9 mg l 1 when the hydrogen peroxide was increased to 7 mm within 6 h uv irradiation likewise mz degradation increased from 49 2 to 54 1 when the k2s2o8 concentration was increased from 4 mm to 6 mm note that increased k2s2o8 concentration created more oxidative radicals so4 and oh favouring degradation of mz 3 15 36 39 however the degradation efficiency decreased to 51 2 when k2s2o8 concentration was elevated to 7 mm likely due to the competitive consumption of the free so4 radicals by the excess k2s2o8 or production of relatively weaker so5 with 1 1 ev resulting in a reduction in the rate of degradation 26 36 6 mm was selected for further tests in this research 3 2 3 variation in initial mz concentration fig 6 a shows the photocatalytic degradation efficiencies of the mz with the concentration of 10 25 50 and 100 mgl 1 in presence of 10 mg ag d nzf per 25 ml of mz at ph 3 without an oxidant it can be seen that the degradation of mz shows an increasing trend with increasing mz initial concentration the solid circle legend after a 6 h reaction with an mz concentration of 50 mgl 1 the degradation efficiency reached 90 1 then at 100 mgl 1 it decreased significantly to 80 1 note that as the ag d nzf dosage remained constant the lower degradation efficiency observed at 100 mgl 1 of mz is due to inadequate reaction sites or active radicals to satisfy the increasing mz species under optimized conditions the mz degradation was studied 88 mz adsorption on the surface of the ag d nzf was observed in preliminary adsorption experiments performed in the dark for 12 h a blank experiment revealed that when the uv light was turned on for 6 h the self degradation of mz was nearly negligible as shown in fig 6b in the presence of uv light alone photolysis only 5 8 of mz could be degraded while degradation increased to 33 9 and 44 8 when optimum oxidants k2s2o8 and h2o2 respectively were added within 360 min under uv irradiation it was found that the photocatalytic degradation of mz obviously increased to 90 1 after 10 mg ag d nzf was added into the system without oxidants which is 1 1 times higher than 10 mg ag d nzf in dark within 360 min in the presence of 10 mg ag d nzf k2s2o8 the degradation of mz reached 74 6 which is 1 37 times higher than when 20 mg ag d nzf k2s2o8 was used the photodegradation activity of ag d nzf h2o2 increased by 7 4 as compared to ag d nzf alone the improved performance can be due to the additional self activation of the h2o2 by ag d nzf the fe ions in the ag d nzf may serve as active sites and react with the h2o2 via a fenton like reaction mechanism to generate more oh radicals to degrade the adsorbed mz 36 in addition to uv light dissociation of the h2o2 as represented in eqs 8 and 9 8 h 2 o 2 u v 2 o h 9 a g d n z f n h 2 o 2 a g d n z f n 1 o h o h the photocatalytic degradation kinetics of mz were investigated under optimized conditions a first order kinetic equation eq 2 was used to fit the data and the degradation rate constant k was obtained from the slope in fig 6c the kinetic data followed the pseudo first order reaction model in all the systems and the rate constant of 0 0103 min 1 was obtained for uv ag d nzf h2o2 comparable to the 0 0196 min 1 reported by aram et al 41 when n tio2 znfe2o4 zeolite resulted in 70 mz degradation after 120 min the rate constants of 0 0083 min 1 and 0 0098 min 1 were obtained for the uv ag d nzf k2s2o8 and uv ag d nzf respectively table 2 by measuring the electrical energy consumed per order eeo the cost of each system was further assessed for a 2 5 l reactor under optimized conditions using 18 w uv light considering the rate constants the total electrical energy required for uv ag d nzf h2o2 uv ag d nzf k2s2o8 and uv ag d nzf are 26 84 33 31 and 28 21 kw h m 3 and equivalent to 1 34 1 67 and 1 41 per m3 of mz degradation respectively the cost of electricity in the turkish republic of northern cyprus is 0 05 per kwh in the year 2020 consequently the lowest electrical energy per order and highest mz degradation efficiency were achieved in the uv ag d nzf h2o2 system 3 3 identification of active radicals and photocatalytic degradation mechanism fig 7 a shows the radical trapping tests to validate each radical s contribution during the degradation process the ag d nzf degradation efficiency was substantially impeded by the application of bq after 360 min of uv irradiation under optimized conditions resulting in 54 7 mz decomposition while 99 9 degradation was achieved without the bq the degradation efficiency decreased by 12 8 and 21 1 in the presence of t buoh and na ox respectively compared to the process without the scavenger the results showed that o2 was the dominant radical while hydroxyl oh radicals and photoinduced holes h contributed moderately to the decomposition processes the probable mechanism of mz photodegradation by ag d nzf is suggested by considering the radical scavenging analysis and uv vis drs results eqs 10 and 11 were used to determine the potential of the conduction band cb and valence band vb of ag d nzf as 0 78 ev and 2 18 ev respectively 10 c b e g v b 11 v b 0 5 e g χ e e ee is 4 5 ev which represents the energy of the free electrons on the hydrogen scale and χ is the calculated ag d nzf s absolute electronegativity both mz species and oxygen were adsorbed to the reactive sites of ag d nzf in the initial dark adsorption process the photons excited electrons e from the vb of the ag d nzf to its cb after uv light irradiation which led to the formation of holes h in the valence band as expressed in eq 12 because of the ag s localized surface plasmon resonance effect 6 18 and the increased separation of photoinduced charge carriers according to the pl study the ag can act as an electron reservoir 4 since the catalyst s cb is more negative than the o2 o2 reduction potential of 0 33 ev vs nhe and so4 s2o8 2 1 44 v vs nhe the photogenerated e can migrate to the catalyst surface react with the adsorbed oxygen and reduce it to superoxide radicals o2 eq 13 also can activate the persulfate to generate so4 radicals eq 14 the h will oxidize mz directly or react with water

results of the radical quenching tests the o2 radicals can degrade the adsorbed mz directly or react further with oxidants in the system to generate oh radicals as shown in fig 7b which is in agreement with previous reports 1 6 39 43 12 a g d n z f e g 2 96 e v h v e c b h v b 13 a g d n z f e c b 0 78 e v o 2 a d s o 2 e 0 0 33 e v v s n h e 14 e c b s 2 o 8 2 s o 4 e 0 1 44 e v v s n h e

performance of ag d nzf fig 8 shows the in vitro antibacterial activities of ag d nzf against e coli and s aureus at various doses it can be seen from time kill assays in fig 8a b that ag d nzf exhibited bacteriostatic and bactericidal actions after uv light irradiation of 60 90 min against the bacterial colonies at 5 25 mg ag d nzf was bacteriostatic toward both bacterial species after 60 min and after 90 min bactericidal toward s aureus except the 5 mg of ag d nzf that was bacteriostatic against e coli the performance of ag d nzf was evaluated in the dark as shown in figs 8c d and 9 after 65 min 25 mg of ag d nzf demonstrated bactericidal effects in the dark and under uv light against e coli and s aureus however under the same conditions 5 mg and 15 mg of ag d nzf exhibited antibacterial ratios of 40 1 and 98 1 towards s aureus in the dark and 92 1 and 89 7 under uv light irradiation respectively notably 15 mg of ag d nzf completely inactivated e coli after 65 min of uv light irradiation while 95 6 antibacterial efficiency was recorded in the dark as noted ag d nzf had higher antibacterial activity on e coli than s aureus strains which may be due to variations in their composition and structure of the cell membrane 44 in previous studies different mechanisms for the bactericidal effects of ferrites metal oxides have been suggested consistently the antibacterial activity of the ag d nzf in the dark can be due to the release of ag ni2 zn2 and fe3 ions which interacted with sulfhydryl groups and phosphorus containing compounds in the bacterial cell membrane causing damage to the dna s replication potential 18 21 44 the ag nzf contains ag ni2 zn2 fe3 ions that can adhere to the surface of biological membranes and the vacant sites in the ag nzf crystallites makes them active in the vicinity of membranes and causing in situ synergy sagayaraj et al 48 who studied the antibacterial activity of w type ferrites zn2 xcuxba1fe16o27 reported a similar observation and mechanism under uv light the intensified antibacterial performance of ag d nzf might be due to the generation of reactive oxygenated species which degraded the membrane leading to cell death however to determine the exact mechanism relating to the antimicrobial activity of ag d nzf further investigation is required 3 5 effect of interference and reusability of ag d nzf to further evaluate the performance of the ag d nzf antibiotics tylosin and tetracycline and various salts nacl kno3 and na2so4 were introduced into the system as interference under optimized conditions after 360 min interaction the ag d nzf degradation efficiency reduced to 36 9 75 2 and 51 2 80 9 in the presence of the ionic salts and antibiotics fig 10 a the ph of the system had an average fluctuation of 0 15 unit at ph 3 0 15 the anions cl 181 pm no3 179 pm and so4 2 258 pm competed with the anionic mz species in the solution for the positively charged ag d nzf the photodegradation performance of the ag d nzf in the presence of the anions may be attributed to the size of the ions and the magnitude of the surface charge the lowest degradation was recorded in the presence of no3 due to its quenching effect nitrate ions can be activated by uv light to generate no2 ions which reacted with oh radicals to produce less reactive nitrogen dioxide radicals no2 that eventually decreased mz degradation this consistent with the study of urdiales et al 42 who reported that ciprofloxacin adsorption by humic acid ferrihydrite composite was significantly hindered in the presence of no3 ions the findings herein suggest that ag d nzf can degrade mz in the presence of interfering antibiotics from natural matrices from fig 10b it can be observed that ag d nzf s degradation efficiency clearly decreased to 71 at the second recycling stage and decreased further to 57 at the fifth reuse stage then remained the same afterwards during the recycling tests the reduction in ag d nzf performance could be due to structural transformation 4 conclusion ni0 5zn0 5fe2o4 was successfully prepared through the co precipitation technique then doped with ag to produce a high performance photosensitive catalyst ag d nzf for photocatalytic disinfection of metronidazole antibiotic mz and bacterial contaminated water the results of the characterization showed that ag d nzf had a stable photocurrent response of 1 36 μa cm 2 with an absorption edge at 419 nm and a 2 96 ev bandgap energy after 360 min of uv irradiation 10 mg of ag d nzf degraded 99 9 of the mz under optimized conditions ph 3 50 mgl 1 mz and 7 mm h2o2 with a rate constant of 0 0103 min 1 which was 1 24 times higher than that in the presence of 6 mm k2s2o8 the total electrical energy consumed by uv ag d nzf h2o2 was 26 84 kw h m 3 equivalent to 1 34 per m3 of mz degradation notably 15 mg of ag d nzf exhibited antibacterial ratios of 98 1 and 95 6 towards s aureus and e coli in the dark and 89 7 100 under uv light irradiation respectively synergistic cooperation between the released ag ni2 zn2 and fe3 ions and generated reactive oxygenated species is attributed to the intensified antibacterial killing

13449,the health of human beings is threatened by drug resistant diseases due to excessive antibiotic use a promising cost competitive water disinfection technology is photocatalytic disinfection in this study ag doped ni0 5zn0 5fe2o4 photosensitive catalyst ag d nzf was synthesized for disinfection of metronidazole antibiotic and bacteria contaminated water ag d nzf was characterized and results revealed it has a bandgap of 2 96 ev exhibiting a stable photocurrent response of 1 36 μa cm 2 with a crystallite size of 15 3 nm and crystallinity of 74 5 after 360 min of uv assisted irradiation under optimal conditions ph 3 and 7 mm h2o2 10 mg ag d nzf degraded 99 9 of 50 mgl 1 mz with an apparent rate constant of 0 0103 min 1 ag d nzf maintained 75 2 80 9 efficiency in the presence of interfering ions and tylosin antibiotic after 65 min 25 mg of ag d nzf demonstrated bactericidal effects 100 inactivation in the dark and under uv light against e coli and s aureus respectively the electrical energy consumed per order revealed that uv ag d nzf h2o2 required 26 84 kw h to degrade mz which is equivalent to 1 34 per m3 of mz a plausible photocatalytic degradation mechanism was established in which o2 was the dominant radical while oh radicals and h contributed moderately to the decomposition processes keywords ternary photocatalyst metronidazole uv induced photodegradation bacterial inactivation ag doped ni zn ferrites 1 introduction antibiotics are used to prevent or treat some forms of bacterial infection for decades saving millions of lives and ensuring longevity metronidazole mz is one of the most widely used antibiotics to treat anaerobic bacterial infections various protozoa giardia infections in dogs cats and sometimes combined with poultry and fish feeds to facilitate weight production 1 4 increased intake of mz its high solubility 10 mg l 1 at 25 c in water and emission of its residues and metabolites result in its saturation in the environment 2 5 the cytotoxic intermediates released from mz have the potential to damage organisms dna membranes and proteins 3 4 particularly mz has been confirmed to be genotoxic to humans and may have carcinogenic and mutagenic effects on aquatic species 5 the removal of mz residues and metabolites from aqueous environments is therefore crucial because antibiotic resistance induced by excessive consumption of antibiotics is an increasing global health hazard that leads to higher medical costs and increased mortality 5 6 at least 700 000 people die yearly because of drug resistant diseases according to the world health organization 7 and in the united states cdc reported that at least 30 000 deaths resulted from antibiotic resistant diseases annually 8 to curtail this threatening hazard different approaches have been used so far to decontaminate mz laden effluents 1 6 9 12 conventional biological methods are time consuming ineffective for mz degradation and generate high sludge 9 12 also mz is not destroyed in physical processes such as adsorption rather it is transferred from a liquid phase to the adsorbent phase and often cause secondary pollution semiconductor based photocatalysis is a promising cost competitive technology for the treatment of wastewater contaminated by antibiotics that enables the use of ultraviolet and direct sunlight to mineralize pseudo resistant organic pharmaceutical pollutants 1 6 in degrading a broad range of distinct contaminants into biodegradable substances heterogeneous photocatalysis using tio2 and zno has proven its effectiveness 3 2 6 although their applications are restricted due to the fast recombination rates of photogenerated carriers and wide energy bandgap 13 14 recent research has shown that spinel ni zn ferrites can be used as a photocatalyst to decompose toxic organic compounds and as antibacterial agents during the treatment of wastewater 15 18 spinel ni zn ferrites are desirable for wastewater decontamination because of their small bandgap 2 2 5 ev intrinsic redox chemistry tunable electronic properties and topologically arranged metal sites 16 21 by solution combustion synthesis technique aali et al 21 synthesized ni0 5zn0 5fe2o4 photocatalyst and recorded 85 methylene blue dye photodegradation and 100 bacteria growth inhibition with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 0 25 mg ml 1 and 0 125 mg ml 1 ml against e coli and s aureus strains respectively nag et al 19 also successfully prepared ni0 5zn0 5fe2o4 polypyrrole nanocomposites by acid assisted in situ oxidative self polymerization technique 90 99 2 degradation was reported for methylene blue and rhodamine b dyes under visible light illumination after 40 min based on previous studies doping the photocatalyst with high conductivity metal ions such as ag au and pt induces highly efficient electron mobility and delays the recombination phase of photo generated electrons holes resulting in increased photocatalyst degradation activity 4 18 22 according to ahmad et al 4 with the incorporation of ag into the zno lattice crystal growth deteriorated with the decrease in crystallite size and suppression rate of the electron hole pair which significantly enhanced metronidazole degradation research on the environmental application of easily separable magnetic ag d ni0 5zn0 5fe2o4 photocatalyst is rare and there is a lack of information focusing on this novel material on the removal of antibiotics as well as bacterial inactivation to decrease human dependence on chlorine ag d ni0 5zn0 5fe2o4 is expected to have a very favourable outlook for the water treatment industry because it can degrade organics and inactivate bacterial strains in this study ag d ni0 5zn0 5fe2o4 ag d nzf photocatalyst was prepared by two step yet simple protocols for eliminating metronidazole antibiotic under uv irradiations the photocatalytic behaviour of ag d nzf was investigated under different conditions and in the presence of other antibiotics or salts as interference besides the antibacterial capacity of the ag d nzf was evaluated against gram positive and gram negative bacteria the high photocatalytic activity of the ag d nzf photocatalyst was discussed in detail based on the experimental results active species trapping and the theoretical estimation of the electronic structure 2 experimental 2 1 materials analytical

sodium hydroxide naoh hydrochloric acid hcl 35 ethanol and metronidazole mz 2 2 synthesis process of ag d ni0 5zn0 5fe2o4 firstly the ni0 5zn0 5fe2o4 nzf nanoparticles were prepared according to modified procedures previously published 14 21 specifically 5 5 g of znso4 7h2o 6 g of niso4 6h2o and 5 7 g of fecl3 6h2o were dissolved in 80 ml distilled water the solution was stirred continuously at 250 rpm until it became homogeneous then 20 ml of acetic acid 0 3 m was added to prevent aggregation afterwards the solution was transferred to an oil bath then stirred vigorously 800 rpm for 3 h at 80 c the cooled solution was dried at 80 c overnight then calcined at 800 c for 2 h in a muffle furnace washed severally with distilled water and dried secondly ag d nzf was prepared accordingly 5 g of nzf was mixed with 50 ml of 0 1 m agno3 and the mixture was stirred at 250 rpm for 45 min at room temperature afterwards the temperature was increased to 70 c and 30 ml of 75 mm naoh was added dropwise the suspension was stirred for another 1 h at 70 c then filtered and washed with water and 50 ethanol the final product was dried at 100 c for 24 h and labelled ag d ni0 5zn0 5fe2o4 2 3

40 kv and 30 ma the measurement was recorded at 2θ 5 0 at a rate of 2 min 1 and the crystalline phases were clarified using standard jcpds files the ag d nzf was characterized by uv vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy drs using a uv 2450 spectrometer shimadzu japan from 200 nm to 800 nm fourier transform infrared ftir spectra were recorded in the range 4000 400 cm 1 using an ftir 8700

f 7000 hitachi high tech japan with optical radiation at λ 340 nm at a bias potential of 1 4 v electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis was performed in the dark and uv light illumination 2 4 uv assisted photocatalytic degradation of metronidazole ag d nzf photocatalytic activity was assessed by reacting with mz solutions in a batch type customized pyrex flask reactor stirred at 200 rpm under uv light 18 w 385 nm t8w5 china in each experiment the desired ag d nzf dose was dispersed in 25 ml of 50 mg l 1 mz solution which was then stirred for 30 min under darkness to achieve the adsorption desorption state before uv light irradiation the initial ph values of the solutions were adjusted with 0 1 m hcl naoh the photocatalytic performance of mz was examined by varying parameters such as ph 3 10 initial mz concentration 10 100 ppm oxidant concentration h2o2 k2s2o4 4 7 mm and dosage of ag d nzf 10 50 mg at the pre determined period the ag d nzf particles were separated from the solution using an external magnet 2 ml of the sample was taken and analyzed for residual mz concentration by uv vis spectroscopy t90 uv vis spectrophotometer pg instruments ltd uk at the λ max 320 nm with a 1 cm path length quartz cell the concentrations were calculated using a linear regression equation y 0 0375x 0 1967 obtained by plotting a calibration curve of mz absorption over a range of concentrations with r2 0 999 the spent photocatalyst was eluted by base spiked distilled water then dried at 40 c and repeatedly reused to investigate the stability and reusability of ag d nzf the trapping experiments were conducted to detect active species during the photocatalytic reaction similar to the procedure used for the photodegradation experiment 5 mm scavengers 1 4 benzoquinone bq tert butyl alcohol t buoh and sodium oxalate naox were added into the mz solution before the addition of the ag d nzf which are o2 oh so4 and h scavengers respectively 23 26 the catalytic activity of ag d nzf was also studied when 50 mg l 1 mz interfered with antibiotics 1 mg l 1 tylosin and tetracycline and various salts 0 1 m of nacl kno3 and na2so4 note the results of successive preliminary studies carried out with nzf were inconsistent and comparably lower than that of ag d nzf hence only the results of ag d nzf are reported 2 5 data analysis each experiment was performed twice and the

coli atcc 25922 were used to test the antimicrobial efficiency of ag d nzf via time kill assays s aureus and e coli cultures were incubated over night at 37 c in muller hinton agar mha biomerieux france and macconkey agar mca biomerieux france respectively the bacterial stock solutions were prepared in mueller hinton broth mhb merck germany and standardized using 0 5 mcfarland instrument 0 5 mcfarland 1 5 108 colony forming units per ml 5 25 mg of ag d nzf was mixed with bacterial solutions which were diluted to 1 107 cfu ml 1 using 50 ml of sterile saline solution the flasks containing the mixture were agitated in two separate cases at 200 rpm 1 h in the dark and 6 h in uv light as a control group flasks containing bacterial solutions without ag d nzf were used for comparison periodically 10 μl was withdrawn from all samples and diluted with 90 μl of mhb finally the diluted solutions were dropped into the agar plate and incubated at 37 c for 24 h the colonies were counted

ag d nzf in both spectra the bands corresponding to the characteristics stretching vibration of metal oxide mo skeleton are observed in the low frequency region of 700 65 cm 1 which is consistent with the ferrites spectrum 14 21 specifically the absorption bands in 597 578 cm 1 and 490 465 cm 1 are due to mtetra o and mocta o bonds respectively which are in agreement with the report of aali et al 21 for the nzf spectrum the obvious bands at 1145 983 cm 1 are due to asymmetric stretching of feom m ni or zn 27 after doping nzf with ag the broad peak at 599 cm 1 in nzf spectrum shifted slightly to 559 cm 1 and resulted in a sharp and strong peak the bands at 1145 983 cm 1 in nzf also deviated to 1158 1040 cm 1 and decreased in intensity in the ag d nzf spectrum which is possibly due to the transformation of the bond lengths as a result of ag doping onto nzf similarly for undoped zno to ag doped zno nanoparticles saravanadevi et al 28 observed a deviation of the absorption bands which were attributed to bond length transformation fig 1b represents the uv vis drs absorption spectra of the nzf and ag d nzf over 200 800 nm both samples exhibit strong absorption in the ultraviolet range particularly nzf shows absorption in the uv region 345 396 nm due to intrinsic band transitions between the m cations and m o2 consistent with other reports 18 21 the absorption edge of nzf is 392 nm while the ag d nzf wavelength region is extended into the visible region with an absorption edge at 419 nm and absorption enhancement around 450 580 nm which is attributed to the interaction of the localized d electrons of ag and s and p electron of the host nzf notably in the range of 200 450 nm the absorption intensity of ag d nzf is greater than that of nzf suggesting that it may possess better catalytic activity in the uv and visible regions fig 1c displays the light response profiles of the nzf and ag d nzf during multiple irradiations of on off light the photocurrent density increased rapidly when the irradiation light was activated for both samples then decreased to a constant value when the light was shut off noticeably ag d nzf demonstrated a photocurrent response of 1 36 μa cm 2 which is 1 7 times higher than that of nzf the samples optical band gap was determined in accordance with the classical tauc equation 6 α h v a h v e g n where α ν h eg n represent absorption coefficient light frequency planck s constant bandgap nature of transition and a is a constant associated with the valence and conduction bands the direct optical band gap of the samples was obtained by plotting αhν 2 vs hν the eg was calculated to be 2 96 ev and 2 99 ev for ag d nzf and nzf respectively the transition and recombination rate of the photogenerated charge carrier were examined by the photoluminescence pl technique as shown in fig 1d both samples had two emission bands around 360 470 nm the broad 390 nm emission originates from an exciton exciton collision mechanism from the recombination of the free excitons and is typically referred to as uv band edge emission 4 at 468 nm the broad blue emission band is possibly due to the direct recombination of electrons in cb and holes in vb 14 24 a weak green emission band was observed at 550 nm for ag d nzf which may be due to the presence of defects or oxygen vacancies the ag d nzf exhibited lower pl intensity in comparison with nzf note that the lower the pl intensity suggests the lower the recombination rate of e and h 25 29 therefore the integration of ag into the nzf enhanced the photoinduced e h pairs separation efficiency by forming a space region with the nzf while the charge carriers adjust themselves in such a way that the fermi level of nzf matched with ag s work function 4 fig 2 a shows sem micrographs of nzf and ag d nzf the ag d nzf has a spongy morphology with agglomerated irregular grain shapes when examined closely the agglomeration may be caused by the crystallites dipole interactions the grains have a wide size range with many appearing to be smaller than 5 μm the agglomeration is lower in nzf and some grain surfaces have hexagonal sections or cut edges in both samples which is the basic crystal cell of ferrites the chemical compositions of both nzf and ag d nzf were determined using energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx as shown in fig 2b and table 1 with no impurities found in the samples the experimental compositions are consistent with the expected stoichiometry of ni0 5zn0 5fe2o4 it s worth noting that the au and pd peaks in the spectra correspond to the metallic coater on which the samples were deposited the eis nyquist plots in fig 2c show the interface charge separation efficiency of the samples the radius of the arc represents the interfacial charge transfer resistance r ct a lower r ct value indicates that the photocatalyst s charge transfer efficiency is higher which corresponds to increased activity order the ag d nzf under uv exhibited the lowest diameter of the semi circle with an r ct value notably lower than that of nzf suggesting a greater separation of the photogenerated electron hole pairs and transfer efficiency which resulted in the highest photocatalytic activity towards degradation of mz the xrd pattern fig 3 of nzf displays the spinel structure of ni zn ferrite jcpds 52 0278 and jcpds 08 0234 with all major diffraction peaks corresponding to the standard pattern of ni0 5zn0 5fe2o4 at the position of 2θ 18 33 33 11 36 67 38 11 53 97 57 18 63 77 and 72 16 matching 111 220 311 400 422 511 440 and 533 miller indices 19 21 30 31 nzf has lattice parameters a b c 8 38 å and an estimated crystallinity of 66 8 similar diffraction peaks were observed in ag d nzf in addition to the distinct diffraction peaks of ag ions at 2θ 35 53 43 92 and 64 52 which corresponds to the 111 200 and 220 planes respectively 32 33 according to the debye scherrer equation d 0 9λ β cos θ the crystallite size of nzf and ag d nzf was obtained as 34 56 and 48 09 nm respectively the positions of the diffraction peaks are almost unaffected by ag doping however the intensity of the diffraction peaks are better separated in the ag d nzf also note that the ag d nzf exhibited higher crystallinity increased dislocation density and lower crystallite size than the nzf see table 1 this is because the ag monovalent dopant likely occupied both the interstitial and lattice sites of the nzf because of its higher ionic radius 1 26 å than zn2 0 74 and ni2 0 69 å hence increased the lattice strain of nzf 34 a similar observation was noted by sathya et al 33 when zno nanoparticles were doped with silver ion the textural characteristics of ag d nzf and nzf are given in table 1 according to the results and the bjh barrett joyner halenda pore size distribution the average pore diameter of ag d nzf is 2 45 nm suggesting that it contains both meso and micropores where the mesopores dominate with a mesopore volume which is 1 5 times that of nzf the ag d nzf surface area is noticeably lower than that of nzf which is likely due to the aggregation of small silver particles into larger bulk particles of ag during the preparation process ali et al 35 also found that doping ag onto a fealo sample reduced its surface area 3 2 evaluation of ag d nzf under varying conditions 3 2 1 solution ph effect a preliminary test was initially performed to determine the photocatalytic degradation of mz using 25 mg ag d nzf when the ph of 50 mgl 1 mz solution was varied in the absence and presence of 4 mm oxidants h2o2 or k2s2o8 the mz degradation trend when the solution ph was varied is attributed to the combination of ph dependent speciation of mz pka 2 5 36 and the surface chemistry of ag d nzf phpzc 7 0 fig 4 a without oxidant the ag d nzf degradation efficiency reached a maximum of 50 at ph 3 after 6 h uv irradiation in the ag d nzf h2o2 system mz degradation reached 78 9 at ph 3 while a decreasing trend was observed when the solution ph was increased beyond ph 3 and reached 14 6 at ph 9 at ph 3 ag d nzf k2s2o8 reached 49 6 and slightly increased to 52 6 at ph 9 fig 4b at ph 3 the anionic mz electron deficient species are dominant in the solution and are electrostatically attracted to the positively charged ag d nzf which resulted in higher degradation efficiency 1 3 36 at ph 9 repulsion occurred between the negatively charged ag d nzf and mz note that the so4 radicals generated from k2s2o8 are efficient at a broad ph while the direct contact between the generated oh radicals and the catalyst at the alkaline condition ph 9 could be hindered by the variety of hydroxyl surface complexes of ag d nzf which resulted to lower degradation efficiency 36 39 therefore subsequent studies were carried out at ph 3 3 2 2 variation in ag d nzf dosage and oxidant concentration fig 5 a shows the degradation efficiency of 50 mgl 1 mz and final concentration obtained after degradation process as the dosage of ag d nzf was varied at ph 3 without an oxidant the degradation efficiency decreased slightly from 90 1 to 86 8 with increasing ag d nzf dosage from 10 mg to 25 mg beyond 25 mg the degradation efficiency decreased remarkably to 79 when ag d nzf dosage was increased to 50 mg the observed decreasing trend in the degradation efficiency herein is likely due to either i increased suspension turbidity due to increased catalyst which resulted in decreases in penetration of uv light and efficiency of photoactivation 33 40 or ii the deactivation of photon activated ag d nzf species by collision with excess ag d nzf as the amount of catalyst increased in the suspension as shown in eq 7 also the aggregation of excess ag d nzf might decrease its effective surface area and adsorption of the mz species 40 7 a g d n z f a g d n z f e x c e s s a g d n z f α a g d n z f here ag d nzf and ag d nzfα represent the uv activated and the deactivated form of catalyst since the most efficient mz removal was observed at 10 mg ag d nzf per 25 ml of mz further testing was performed at this dose fig 5b shows the mz degradation efficiency and final concentration in the solution when the oxidants initial concentration were varied from 4 mm to 7 mm using 20 mg ag d nzf at solution ph 3 the mz degradation efficiency increased rapidly from 78 9 to 85 5 when h2o2 concentration was increased from 4 mm to 5 mm while the degradation efficiency only increased slightly to 88 2 at 7 mm h2o2 the increasing trend is associated with increases in the generation of oh radicals as the h2o2 concentration increased the initial mz concentration was 50 mgl 1 which decreased remarkably to 10 mgl 1 when 4 mm h2o2 was added to the solution and finally decreased to 5 9 mg l 1 when the hydrogen peroxide was increased to 7 mm within 6 h uv irradiation likewise mz degradation increased from 49 2 to 54 1 when the k2s2o8 concentration was increased from 4 mm to 6 mm note that increased k2s2o8 concentration created more oxidative radicals so4 and oh favouring degradation of mz 3 15 36 39 however the degradation efficiency decreased to 51 2 when k2s2o8 concentration was elevated to 7 mm likely due to the competitive consumption of the free so4 radicals by the excess k2s2o8 or production of relatively weaker so5 with 1 1 ev resulting in a reduction in the rate of degradation 26 36 6 mm was selected for further tests in this research 3 2 3 variation in initial mz concentration fig 6 a shows the photocatalytic degradation efficiencies of the mz with the concentration of 10 25 50 and 100 mgl 1 in presence of 10 mg ag d nzf per 25 ml of mz at ph 3 without an oxidant it can be seen that the degradation of mz shows an increasing trend with increasing mz initial concentration the solid circle legend after a 6 h reaction with an mz concentration of 50 mgl 1 the degradation efficiency reached 90 1 then at 100 mgl 1 it decreased significantly to 80 1 note that as the ag d nzf dosage remained constant the lower degradation efficiency observed at 100 mgl 1 of mz is due to inadequate reaction sites or active radicals to satisfy the increasing mz species under optimized conditions the mz degradation was studied 88 mz adsorption on the surface of the ag d nzf was observed in preliminary adsorption experiments performed in the dark for 12 h a blank experiment revealed that when the uv light was turned on for 6 h the self degradation of mz was nearly negligible as shown in fig 6b in the presence of uv light alone photolysis only 5 8 of mz could be degraded while degradation increased to 33 9 and 44 8 when optimum oxidants k2s2o8 and h2o2 respectively were added within 360 min under uv irradiation it was found that the photocatalytic degradation of mz obviously increased to 90 1 after 10 mg ag d nzf was added into the system without oxidants which is 1 1 times higher than 10 mg ag d nzf in dark within 360 min in the presence of 10 mg ag d nzf k2s2o8 the degradation of mz reached 74 6 which is 1 37 times higher than when 20 mg ag d nzf k2s2o8 was used the photodegradation activity of ag d nzf h2o2 increased by 7 4 as compared to ag d nzf alone the improved performance can be due to the additional self activation of the h2o2 by ag d nzf the fe ions in the ag d nzf may serve as active sites and react with the h2o2 via a fenton like reaction mechanism to generate more oh radicals to degrade the adsorbed mz 36 in addition to uv light dissociation of the h2o2 as represented in eqs 8 and 9 8 h 2 o 2 u v 2 o h 9 a g d n z f n h 2 o 2 a g d n z f n 1 o h o h the photocatalytic degradation kinetics of mz were investigated under optimized conditions a first order kinetic equation eq 2 was used to fit the data and the degradation rate constant k was obtained from the slope in fig 6c the kinetic data followed the pseudo first order reaction model in all the systems and the rate constant of 0 0103 min 1 was obtained for uv ag d nzf h2o2 comparable to the 0 0196 min 1 reported by aram et al 41 when n tio2 znfe2o4 zeolite resulted in 70 mz degradation after 120 min the rate constants of 0 0083 min 1 and 0 0098 min 1 were obtained for the uv ag d nzf k2s2o8 and uv ag d nzf respectively table 2 by measuring the electrical energy consumed per order eeo the cost of each system was further assessed for a 2 5 l reactor under optimized conditions using 18 w uv light considering the rate constants the total electrical energy required for uv ag d nzf h2o2 uv ag d nzf k2s2o8 and uv ag d nzf are 26 84 33 31 and 28 21 kw h m 3 and equivalent to 1 34 1 67 and 1 41 per m3 of mz degradation respectively the cost of electricity in the turkish republic of northern cyprus is 0 05 per kwh in the year 2020 consequently the lowest electrical energy per order and highest mz degradation efficiency were achieved in the uv ag d nzf h2o2 system 3 3 identification of active radicals and photocatalytic degradation mechanism fig 7 a shows the radical trapping tests to validate each radical s contribution during the degradation process the ag d nzf degradation efficiency was substantially impeded by the application of bq after 360 min of uv irradiation under optimized conditions resulting in 54 7 mz decomposition while 99 9 degradation was achieved without the bq the degradation efficiency decreased by 12 8 and 21 1 in the presence of t buoh and na ox respectively compared to the process without the scavenger the results showed that o2 was the dominant radical while hydroxyl oh radicals and photoinduced holes h contributed moderately to the decomposition processes the probable mechanism of mz photodegradation by ag d nzf is suggested by considering the radical scavenging analysis and uv vis drs results eqs 10 and 11 were used to determine the potential of the conduction band cb and valence band vb of ag d nzf as 0 78 ev and 2 18 ev respectively 10 c b e g v b 11 v b 0 5 e g χ e e ee is 4 5 ev which represents the energy of the free electrons on the hydrogen scale and χ is the calculated ag d nzf s absolute electronegativity both mz species and oxygen were adsorbed to the reactive sites of ag d nzf in the initial dark adsorption process the photons excited electrons e from the vb of the ag d nzf to its cb after uv light irradiation which led to the formation of holes h in the valence band as expressed in eq 12 because of the ag s localized surface plasmon resonance effect 6 18 and the increased separation of photoinduced charge carriers according to the pl study the ag can act as an electron reservoir 4 since the catalyst s cb is more negative than the o2 o2 reduction potential of 0 33 ev vs nhe and so4 s2o8 2 1 44 v vs nhe the photogenerated e can migrate to the catalyst surface react with the adsorbed oxygen and reduce it to superoxide radicals o2 eq 13 also can activate the persulfate to generate so4 radicals eq 14 the h will oxidize mz directly or react with water molecules or hydroxyl ions in an alkaline ph system to generate highly oxidizing oh radicals because the vb is more positive than oh h2o 2 10 ev vs nhe and ho oh 1 99 ev vs nhe eqs 15 and 16 given the results of the radical quenching tests the o2 radicals can degrade the adsorbed mz directly or react further with oxidants in the system to generate oh radicals as shown in fig 7b which is in agreement with previous reports 1 6 39 43 12 a g d n z f e g 2 96 e v h v e c b h v b 13 a g d n z f e c b 0 78 e v o 2 a d s o 2 e 0 0 33 e v v s n h e 14 e c b s 2 o 8 2 s o 4 e 0 1 44 e v v s n h e

performance of ag d nzf fig 8 shows the in vitro antibacterial activities of ag d nzf against e coli and s aureus at various doses it can be seen from time kill assays in fig 8a b that ag d nzf exhibited bacteriostatic and bactericidal actions after uv light irradiation of 60 90 min against the bacterial colonies at 5 25 mg ag d nzf was bacteriostatic toward both bacterial species after 60 min and after 90 min bactericidal toward s aureus except the 5 mg of ag d nzf that was bacteriostatic against e coli the performance of ag d nzf was evaluated in the dark as shown in figs 8c d and 9 after 65 min 25 mg of ag d nzf demonstrated bactericidal effects in the dark and under uv light against e coli and s aureus however under the same conditions 5 mg and 15 mg of ag d nzf exhibited antibacterial ratios of 40 1 and 98 1 towards s aureus in the dark and 92 1 and 89 7 under uv light irradiation respectively notably 15 mg of ag d nzf completely inactivated e coli after 65 min of uv light irradiation while 95 6 antibacterial efficiency was recorded in the dark as noted ag d nzf had higher antibacterial activity on e coli than s aureus strains which may be due to variations in their composition and structure of the cell membrane 44 in previous studies different mechanisms for the bactericidal effects of ferrites metal oxides have been suggested consistently the antibacterial activity of the ag d nzf in the dark can be due to the release of ag ni2 zn2 and fe3 ions which interacted with sulfhydryl groups and phosphorus containing compounds in the bacterial cell membrane causing damage to the dna s replication potential 18 21 44 the ag nzf contains ag ni2 zn2 fe3 ions that can adhere to the surface of biological membranes and the vacant sites in the ag nzf crystallites makes them active in the vicinity of membranes and causing in situ synergy sagayaraj et al 48 who studied the antibacterial activity of w type ferrites zn2 xcuxba1fe16o27 reported a similar observation and mechanism under uv light the intensified antibacterial performance of ag d nzf might be due to the generation of reactive oxygenated species which degraded the membrane leading to cell death however to determine the exact mechanism relating to the antimicrobial activity of ag d nzf further investigation is required 3 5 effect of interference and reusability of ag d nzf to further evaluate the performance of the ag d nzf antibiotics tylosin and tetracycline and various salts nacl kno3 and na2so4 were introduced into the system as interference under optimized conditions after 360 min interaction the ag d nzf degradation efficiency reduced to 36 9 75 2 and 51 2 80 9 in the presence of the ionic salts and antibiotics fig 10 a the ph of the system had an average fluctuation of 0 15 unit at ph 3 0 15 the anions cl 181 pm no3 179 pm and so4 2 258 pm competed with the anionic mz species in the solution for the positively charged ag d nzf the photodegradation performance of the ag d nzf in the presence of the anions may be attributed to the size of the ions and the magnitude of the surface charge the lowest degradation was recorded in the presence of no3 due to its quenching effect nitrate ions can be activated by uv light to generate no2 ions which reacted with oh radicals to produce less reactive nitrogen dioxide radicals no2 that eventually decreased mz degradation this consistent with the study of urdiales et al 42 who reported that ciprofloxacin adsorption by humic acid ferrihydrite composite was significantly hindered in the presence of no3 ions the findings herein suggest that ag d nzf can degrade mz in the presence of interfering antibiotics from natural matrices from fig 10b it can be observed that ag d nzf s degradation efficiency clearly decreased to 71 at the second recycling stage and decreased further to 57 at the fifth reuse stage then remained the same afterwards during the recycling tests the reduction in ag d nzf performance could be due to structural transformation 4 conclusion ni0 5zn0 5fe2o4 was successfully prepared through the co precipitation technique then doped with ag to produce a high performance photosensitive catalyst ag d nzf for photocatalytic disinfection of metronidazole antibiotic mz and bacterial contaminated water the results of the characterization showed that ag d nzf had a stable photocurrent response of 1 36 μa cm 2 with an absorption edge at 419 nm and a 2 96 ev bandgap energy after 360 min of uv irradiation 10 mg of ag d nzf degraded 99 9 of the mz under optimized conditions ph 3 50 mgl 1 mz and 7 mm h2o2 with a rate constant of 0 0103 min 1 which was 1 24 times higher than that in the presence of 6 mm k2s2o8 the total electrical energy consumed by uv ag d nzf h2o2 was 26 84 kw h m 3 equivalent to 1 34 per m3 of mz degradation notably 15 mg of ag d nzf exhibited antibacterial ratios of 98 1 and 95 6 towards s aureus and e coli in the dark and 89 7 100 under uv light irradiation respectively synergistic cooperation between the released ag ni2 zn2 and fe3 ions and generated reactive oxygenated species is attributed to the intensified antibacterial killing
