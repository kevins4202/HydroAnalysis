16570,the recent discovery of complete ammonia oxidation comammox has increased our understanding of nitrification although comammox has been shown to play an important role in plain wetland ecosystems studies of comammox contribution are still limited in plateau wetland ecosystems here we analyzed the abundance activity community and biogeochemical mechanisms of the comammox bacteria in yunnan kweichow and qinghai tibet plateau wetlands from elevations of 1000 5000 m comammox bacteria were widely distributed in all 16 sediment samples with abundances higher than 0 96 0 26 107 copies g 1 n 16 comammox showed high activity 1 18 0 17 to 1 98 0 08 mg n kg 1 d 1 at high elevation 3000 5000 m and dominated the nitrification process activity contribution 37 20 60 62 the activity contribution of ammonia oxidizing bacteria 1 07 0 08 to 2 79 0 35 mg n kg 1 d 1 dominated the nitrification process 44 55 64 15 in low elevation 1000 3000 m samples all detected comammox nitrospira belonged to clade a while clade b was not detected elevation always had a strongest effect on key comammox species thus we infer that elevation may drive the high relative abundance of the species candidatus nitrospira nitrificans avg 12 40 and the low relative abundance of the species nitrospira sp sg bin2 avg 4 75 in high elevation samples that showed a high comammox activity avg 1 62 mg n kg 1 d 1 and high contribution avg 46 08 to the nitrification process these results indicate that comammox may be an important and currently underestimated microbial nitrification process in plateau wetland ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords plateau wetland sediments elevation ranges comammox activity key comammox species biogeochemical driving pattern 1 introduction nitrification plays an important role in the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle wuchter et al 2006 hayatsu et al 2008 li et al 2018 accounting for 330 tg of nitrogen flux from terrestrial ecosystems kuypers et al 2018 since it was discovered in 1890s winogradsky 1890 the generally accepted canonical nitrification process consists of two steps winogradsky 1890 costa et al 2006 tourna et al 2008 vlaeminck et al 2011 which are driven by ammonia oxidizing archaea bacteria aoa aob nh4 no2 and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob no2 no3 respectively a previous study predicted that complete oxidation of ammonia to nitrate complete ammonia oxidation comammox in one organism is energetically feasible costa et al 2006 in 2015 comammox was first confirmed in metagenomic sequences from enrichment cultures containing the genus nitrospira daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 all currently known comammox bacteria belong to nitrospira sublineage ii van kessel et al 2015 pinto et al 2016 which can be further classified into clade a including subclade a1 and a2 and clade b daims et al 2015 xia et al 2018 comammox widely distributed in both artificial and natural ecosystems such as biological wastewater treatment systems xia et al 2018 agricultural soils wang et al 2019 comammox enrichment reactor zhao et al 2021 and synthetic communities in reactor gottshall et al 2021 forest soils li et al 2020 lake sediments shi et al 2020 riparian zone soils wang et al 2021a and salt marshes wang et al 2021b except comammox enrichment reactor 5 81 108 to 9 04 109 copies g 1 the abundance of comammox bacteria in these natural ecosystems 1 84 105 to 3 19 108 copies g 1 is usually higher than that in these artificial ecosystems 1 16 103 to 6 31 105 copies g 1 moreover a similar trend was observed in the limited activity data of comammox agricultural soils 0 03 to 0 40 mg n kg 1 d 1 wang et al 2020a riparian zones soils 0 04 to 0 86 mg n kg 1 d 1 wang et al 2021a compared with the natural ecosystems artificial ecosystems are always confronted with a heavy nitrogen load kuschk et al 2003 amador et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 therefore comammox may play a more important role in natural ecosystems with less human disturbance and a light nitrogen load wetlands which are important ecosystems for biogeochemical cycles have received increasing attention on a regional and global scale marton et al 2015 zedler and kercher 2005 schuerch et al 2018 the nitrification process has been confirmed to regulate the ecological functions of natural wetlands including removing pollutants purifying water and reducing greenhouse gases globally mcclain et al 2003 morse and bernhardt 2013 zak and grigal 1991 previous studies have analyzed the abundance activity and community structure of comammox bacteria in natural wetland liu et at 2020 wang et al 2021a wang et al 2021b however with the rapid development of human society the nitrogen load of natural wetlands in gradually increasing saunders and kalff 2001 verhoeven et al 2006 zhou et al 2014 therefore it is necessary to apply the research of comammox to plateau wetlands with less human disturbance and light nitrogen load it can be expected that comammox may play an important role in the plateau wetland ecosystem furthermore elevation can drive biogeochemical factors leading to different distributions of microorganisms bryant et al 2008 shen et al 2014 mod et al 2021 elevation has been shown to significantly affect community structure of nitrifier aoa and aob in plateau soils and rivers zhang et al 2009 zhao et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 these results indicate that elevation can drive aoa species to show different adaptation patterns to environmental factors and the differences of these patterns lead to the changes of aoa community in plateau soils zhao et al 2017 the similar results were also found in aob of plateau rivers zhang et al 2019 at present there are few reports about the distribution patterns of comammox bacteria in elevated plateau wetland ecosystems two major plateaus in china the yunnan kweichow and qinghai tibet plateaus are located in the southwest of the country the complex environmental conditions give them different characteristics the qinghai tibet plateau is the highest and most extensive highland in the world and is known as the roof of the world with an average elevation over than 4000 m cui and graf 2009 liu et al 2017 the yunnan kweichow plateau is one of the most developed typical karst areas in the world accordingly there are obvious climatic and geological differences pan et al 2020 these two plateaus contains abundant and diverse wetlands that are of great significance to global terrestrial ecosystems liu et al 2017 ma et al 2020 pan et al 2020 compared with eastern china the low population and backward economic development result in a relatively light nitrogen load into these plateau wetlands li et al 2019a pan et al 2020 here it can be expected that comammox may have an important contribution to nitrification and that there may be a unique biogeochemical driven pattern of the comammox community in summary the objectives of this research were to 1 investigate the abundance activity and community composition of comammox bacteria and compare the contribution of comammox to the nitrification process with canonical nitrifiers aoa and aob in the plateau wetlands and 2 reveal the biogeochemical driven mechanisms of the comammox community in the plateau wetlands for this research 16 sediment samples from the plateau wetlands were

nitrifiers in plateau wetlands based on the qpcr and double inhibition assay the amoa gene abundance and activities of three nitrifiers were established fig 1b the comammox gene abundance ranged from 0 96 0 26 107 to 5 88 0 59 107 copies g 1 in the plateau wetlands the comammox gene abundance showed a positive correlation spearman p 0 05 n 16 supporting information table s4 with the substrate nh4 and did not change substantially with increasing elevation the activity of comammox ranged from 0 35 0 05 to 1 98 0 08 mg n kg 1 d 1 in the plateau wetlands furthermore the comammox activity of the high elevation samples 3000 5000 m samples 9 16 avg 1 62 0 38 mg n kg 1 d 1 was significantly higher paired t test p 0 05 n 8 than that of the low elevation samples 1000 3000 m samples 1 8 avg 0 82 0 25 mg n kg 1 d 1 the activity of comammox was positively correlated with elevation ahm annual heat moisture index nh4 and ph but negatively correlated with moisture spearman p 0 01 n 16 supporting information table s4 since comammox clade b bacteria were not detected in any samples gel electrophoresis not detected supporting information figure s2 qpcr below the detection limit 1 103 copies g 1 both the abundance and activities belong to comammox clade a taxa the aob abundance 0 92 0 03 108 to 5 99 0 35 108 copies g 1 was significantly higher paired t test p 0 05 n 16 than aoa 0 33 0 08 107 to 1 16 0 04 107 copies g 1 and comammox bacteria in all samples however the contribution of the aob activity to the nitrification process was only dominant in 6 of the 8 low elevation samples 1 07 0 08 to 2 79 0 35 mg n kg 1 d 1 44 55 64 15 paired t test p 0 05 n 6 the comammox activity 1 18 0 17 to 1 98 0 08 mg n kg 1 d 1 accounted for 37 20 60 62 to the nitrification process which was obviously higher than aob and aoa in 7 of the 8 high elevation samples paired t test p 0 05 n 7 the activity of aoa 0 19 0 04 to 1 35 0 03 mg n kg 1 d 1 was lower than that of comammox bacteria and aob in all samples except for samples 1 and 7 the activities of the three nitrifiers significantly correlated with elevation and the substrate nh4 spearman p 0 05 n 16 supporting information table s4 these results indicate that comammox is widely distributed in all samples and dominates the nitrification process in the 3000 5000 m samples furthermore elevation and nh4 are key factors affecting the activity of nitrifiers 3 2 biodiversity and community composition of comammox bacteria in the plateau wetlands a total of 320 000 comammox nitrospira sequences 20 000 sequences per sample were obtained from high throughput sequencing these sequences were clustered into 300 otus based on a 0 97 identity threshold value the results demonstrate that the richness of the comammox community increased with elevation richness index 143 1 to 393 2 chao1 estimator 172 4 to 396 1 fig 2 a even though there were significant differences anova p 0 05 n 4 in community richness within the same elevation range the richness index was positively correlated with the comammox activity and the contribution to nitrification spearman p 0 049 n 16 there was no significant difference of community evenness shannon index 2 81 to 3 54 simpson index 0 87 to 0 94 in all 16 samples an obvious spatial clustering pattern of community structure was revealed based on bray curtis distances fig 2b the pcoa results clearly show that the comammox community differences were obvious between the elevation ranges permanova r2 0 84 p 0 001 n 16 especially between the low elevation 1000 3000 m samples 1 8 and high elevation 3000 5000 m samples 9 16 samples based on pc1 82 high elevation samples had a higher community richness activity and contribution to nitrification all these characteristics richness activity and contribution were positively correlated with elevation ahm annual heat moisture index and nh4 but negatively correlated with moisture spearman p 0 05 n 16 supporting information table s4 the 23 typical otus constituting 80 60 of the total sequences were used to construct phylogenetic trees and perform circlize analysis comammox clade a 2 bacteria 19 otus 73 43 fig 2c was the dominant cluster when compared with clade a 1 4 otus 7 17 the clade a 2 cluster was affiliated with the metagenome assembled genomes mags species nitrospira sp sg bin1 35 35 sg bin2 25 48 and st bin4 12 60 the clade a 1 cluster was closely related to the species candidatus nitrospira nitrificans 7 17 nitrospira sp sg bin1 and st bin4 of clade a 1 were the dominant species of each elevation range fig 2d the proportion of nitrospira sp sg bin2 otu1 and otu6 decreased with increasing elevation in addition more than 80 of candidatus nitrospira nitrificans otu7 otu9 otu12 and 32 were from high elevation samples 3 3 co occurrence of comammox bacteria in the plateau wetlands the co occurrence of comammox bacteria was explored using network inferences based on 300 otus with significant p value 0 05 correlations nitrospira sp sg bin1 and st bin4 accounted for more than 80 of the total nodes in the three networks fig 3 these two species have the highest closeness centrality avg 0 69 0 64 and always closely interconnected with other species in the three networks the main difference between the low elevation 1000 3000 m samples 1 8 fig 3a and high elevation 3000 5000 m samples 9 16 fig 3b networks was that candidatus nitrospira nitrificans had more negative interaction links 8 to 386 more nodes 11 to 38 and a higher degree value 19 to 136 with increased elevation while nitrospira sp sg bin2 has more positive interaction links 108 to 314 fewer nodes 54 to 11 and a lower degree value 189 to 66 with increased elevation supporting information table s5 moreover most interaction links of candidatus nitrospira nitrificans were negative 213 of 268 while most interaction links of nitrospira sp sg bin2 were positive 251 of 314 in the 16 sample network fig 3c supporting information table s5 this kind of co occurrence pattern maybe caused by interspecific competition and symbiosis the relative abundance of candidatus nitrospira nitrificans increased with elevation while nitrospira sp sg bin2 showed a decreasing trend fig 3d the relative abundance of these two species were significantly correlated with the comammox activity and contribution to nitrification nitrificans positive sg bin2 negative spearman p 0 019 n 16 the high elevation samples with a higher comammox activity and higher contribution to nitrification have more candidatus nitrospira nitrificans avg 12 40 with negative interaction links and less nitrospira sp sg bin2 avg 4 75 with positive interaction links niche differentiation of these key species was possibly caused by the biogeochemical factors in the plateau wetlands 3 4 biogeochemical factors affect key species of comammox bacteria in the plateau wetlands the relationship between key comammox species with biogeochemical factors based on bray curtis distance was analyzed by the mantel test fig 4 a the results indicate that the relative abundances of key species were significantly correlated with elevation mean annual temperature mean annual precipitation ahm nh4 ph moisture and tn although tn is a non significant factor it is closely related to nh4 furthermore spearman s correlation confirmed these results supporting information table s4 results of the variation partitioning analysis demonstrated that the lone explanation of elevation climatic factors elevation and ahm 16 on key species was higher than physicochemical factors nh4 ph moisture and tn 2 and that the interactive explanation was 95 fig 4b this indicates that elevation climatic and physicochemical factors jointly explained the niche differentiation of the two key species path analysis was conducted to determine the effects of biogeochemical factors on key species through structural equation pattern sem fig 4c for candidatus nitrospira nitrificans there were significant direct effects from elevation Î» 1 58 p 0 001 ahm Î» 0 71 p 0 001 nh4 Î» 0 33 p 0 05 ph Î» 0 45 p 0 05 moisture Î» 0 41 p 0 01 and tn Î» 0 21 p 0 001 moreover elevation also had a significant direct effect Î» 1 23 p 0 001 on nitrospira sp sg bin2 the effects of physicochemical factors on nitrospira sp sg bin2 was less than candidatus nitrospira nitrificans the results of total effects showed that elevation was the most important factor as it always had the strongest direct and indirect via climatic and physicochemical factors effects on the key species fig 4d elevation could drive environmental factors and affect niche differentiation of key species in the plateau wetlands the niche difference of key species probably to led to a higher comammox activity and higher contribution to nitrification in the high elevation 3000 5000 m samples 9 16 samples 3 5 linear relationship between key species of comammox bacteria and biogeochemical factors in the plateau wetlands the sem results showed that elevation climatic and physicochemical factors jointly affected the key comammox species with elevation as the most important factor thus the relative abundances of key species were regressed against biogeochemical factors in order to understand their response fig 5 the response of key species to each factor indicates that they have different subsistence patterns with the change of environment because the linear association of the two key species was completely opposite elevation had a significant positive y 0 01x 9 31 r2 0 83 p 0 05 n 16 and negative y 0 01x 31 68 r2 0 87 p 0 05 n 16 linear association with key candidatus nitrospira nitrificans and nitrospira sp sg bin2 respectively the linear association between nh4 and the relative abundances of candidatus nitrospira nitrificans y 2 60x 5 59 r2 0 75 p 0 05 n 16 and nitrospira sp sg bin2 y 3 02x 26 17 r2 0 77 p 0 05 n 16 was the most significant among the physicochemical factors however ahm ph moisture and tn also show a linear relationship with relative abundance 4 discussion we found that comammox was widely distributed in the yunnan kweichow and qinghai tibet plateau wetland ecosystems to the best of our knowledge this is the first report showing that comammox dominates the nitrification process in a plateau wetland ecosystem elevation could drive environmental factors affecting niche differentiation of the key comammox species together these findings contribute to our understanding of biogeochemical cycles and ecological functions of comammox bacteria in terrestrial ecosystems 4 1 comparison of comammox activities abundance and influencing factors between the plateau wetlands and other ecosystems the activity of comammox was determined using a method developed by our research group since this method was only recently described few results of comammox activities have been reported to date however from the limited data the comammox activity and contribution to nitrification 1 18 0 17 to 1 98 0 08 mg n kg 1 d 1 37 20 to 60 62 observed in this study exceeded that in fringe soils 0 19 to 0 45 mg n kg 1 d 1 33 8 to 39 6 which is the primary zone of comammox bacteria in plain wetlands wang et al 2021a meanwhile the comammox bacteria abundance in our research 0 96 0 26 to 5 88 0 59 107 copies g 1 was obviously higher than that in many other ecosystems such as plateau rivers highest 1 25 104 copies l 1 zhang et al 2020 plain wetlands 0 11 to 2 02 106 copies g 1 wang et al 2021b and plain dryland 4 14 104 to 1 65 107 copies g 1 xu et al 2020 our study reports that elevation and ahm promote the activity of comammox and that comammox bacteria have low temperature tolerance the main reason is that elevation can affect microbial activity by affecting the climatic and physicochemical factors which is consistent with previous research lanzÃ©n et al 2016 frindte et al 2019 the low nh4 concentration 1 10 mg kg 1 of plateau wetlands is beneficial to the survival comammox bacteria previous studies have shown that comammox bacteria are widely distributed in low nh4 environments such as freshwater sediments 11 95 mg kg 1 zhang et al 2020 activated sludge 8 75 mg kg 1 wang et al 2021c and rapid sand filters 0 53 mg kg 1 fowler et al 2018 furthermore our results are consistent with a previous study showing that comammox bacteria favored growth in a slightly alkaline environment wang et al 2021b 4 2 unique community structures of comammox bacteria in plateau wetland all comammox sequences in this research belonged to clade a with no clade b sequences detected this agrees with previous studies showing a low or nonexistent abundance of comammox clade b bacteria in other ecosystems including agricultural soils li et al 2019b xu et al 2020 and forest soils shi et al 2018 li et al 2020 recent studies have shown that the amt type ammonia transporters of clade b have a low uptake rate per gram biomass which benefits their survival in fluctuating low ammonium conditions fowler et al 2018 koch et al 2019 xu et al 2020 and supports autotrophic growth in forest soil without ammonium amendment wang et al 2019 therefore clade b maybe not suitable for life in the ammonium stable conditions 1 10 mg kg 1 of the plateau wetland sediments moreover comammox clade a bacteria have more targeted functions than those of clade b including a close relation to reductive tricarboxylic acid rtca cycle the ability to utilize cyanate as an alternative substrate for ammonia oxidation and utilization of hydrogen poghosyan et al 2019 spasov et al 2020 compared with clade a 1 clade a 2 dominated the comammox community of the plateau wetland sediments in this research previous studies have shown that clade a 1 is the dominant cluster in natural water ecosystems freshwater and groundwater pjevac et al 2017 and engineered water systems drinking water systems wang et al 2017 activated sludge wang et al 2021c rapid sand filters fowler et al 2018 while clade a2 is more frequently found in soils and sediments li et al 2020 xu et al 2020 which is consistent with our results in this study there was more clade a 1 candidatus nitrospira nitrificans avg 12 40 and less clade a 2 nitrospira sp sg bin2 avg 4 75 in the high elevation samples 3000 5000 m the relative abundance of these two key species significantly correlated with the comammox activities nitrificans positive sg bin2 negative so far the only available pure culture of clade a bacteria candidatus nitrospira inopinata belongs to clade a 1 kits et al 2017 which means clade a 1 may have a higher cultivability and activity than clade a 2 palomo et a 2018 this may be the reason that the high elevation samples have higher comammox activities and a higher contribution to the nitrification process 4 3 special biogeochemical driven patterns of comammox bacteria in plateau wetland in our study elevation climatic and physicochemical factors explained 95 of the effect on key comammox species there are many studies showing that geographical climatic and physicochemical properties are the main factors driving the differentiation of bacteria on a spatial scale monroy et al 2012 mchugh et al 2017 which is consistent with our results previous studies have shown that elevation is an important source of stress on microbial communities on a spatial scale ettema and wardle 2002 fierer and jackson 2006 fierer et al 2009 causing high fluctuations in temperature precipitation and physicochemical properties our sem results agree with these previous studies in that elevation always had the strongest direct and indirect via climatic and physicochemical factors effects on key comammox species of the physicochemical factors nh4 ph moisture and tn had a great effect on key comammox species in this research these factors also effect comammox community in other ecosystems xu et al 2020 wang et al 2021a wang et al 2021b at the same time specialized survival strategies are necessary for the bacteria of plateau wetlands to withstand the multiple environmental stresses imposed by elevation hernandez et al 2021 the relative abundances of the two key species showed a completely opposite linear association with the factors indicating they have different specialized survival strategies under environmental stress the specialized survival strategy can be driven by species interactions with positive correlations resulting from facilitation mutualism and negative correlations resulting from competition zelezniak et al 2015 durÃ¡n et al 2018 it is possible that nitrospira sp sg bin2 was replaced in the high elevation samples by the competitive and stress tolerant candidatus nitrospira nitrificans which showed a higher comammox activity and higher contribution to the nitrification process 4 4 the differences between comammox bacteria and canonical nitrifiers aoa and aob in the plateau wetlands our results show that both aob and comammox activities were positively correlated with nh4 while the aoa activity was negatively correlated with nh4 these correlations can be explained by kinetic characteristics the nh4 substrate affinity of comammox bacteria ks 60 nm kits et al 2017 and aob ks 0 14 1 9 mm dytczaket al 2008 are obviously higher than aoa ks 0 13 Âµm sonthiphand and limpiyakorn 2011 previous studies also show that aoa are more adapted to nitrogen depleted environments leininger et al 2006 he et al 2007 lehtovirta morley et al 2011 and aob are more adapted to nitrogen rich environments with their eutrophic lifestyle di et al 2009 nicol and schleper 2006 as supported by our results furthermore the higher activity of comammox bacteria compared with aoa and aob may be attributed to the distinctive microaerobic conditions of the plateau wetlands as genomic evidence shows that the metabolic cycles of aoa thaumarchaeal hp hb cycle and aob cbb cycle are oxygen tolerant kÃ¶nneke et al 2014 while that of comammox bacteria reductive rtca cycle is oxygen sensitive campbell et al 2006 in this study the do level in sediments should be very low because it decline sharply with sediment depth this is caused by the limited permeability of oxygen in sediments zhu et al 2020 liu et al 2021 previous studies found that comammox process recovered under low do conditions 0 5 mg l which is caused by increasing oxygen affinity of comammox under the low do conditions bellucci et al 2011 arnaldos et al 2013 liu and wang 2013 keene et al 2017 however low do conditions can inhibit canonical nitrification significantly bae et al 2001 park and noguera 2004 for instance as the do concentration of activated sludge decreased from 4 2 mg l to 0 16 mg l the k do value of aob decreased from 0 71 mg l to 0 39 mg l liu and wang 2015 although the apparent oxygen affinity of the comammox bacteria remains to be measured both the theoretical prediction and genomic studies indicate that they likely adapt to low do conditions costa et al 2006 lawson and lÃ¼cker 2018 many studies of wastewater treatment systems demonstrated that the comammox bacteria adapted well to low do conditions camejo et al 2017 beach and noguera 2019 roots et al 2019 wang et al 2020b furthermore comammox bacteria has special functions under low do conditions such as utilizing formate koch et al 2015 and symbiosis with anammox bacteria to promote nitrogen loss gottshall et al 2021 5 conclusions this study investigated the abundance activities and community of the comammox bacteria in the yunnan kweichow and qinghai tibet plateau wetlands 1000 5000 m highlighting that elevation is the most important driving factor some detailed conclusions are as follows 1 comammox bacteria were widely distributed in sediments samples of the plateau wetlands compared with canonical nitrifiers ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa and bacteria aob comammox bacteria showed high activities 1 18 0 17 to 1 98 0 08 mg n kg 1 d 1 and dominated the nitrification process 37 20 60 62 in the high elevation 3000 5000 m samples 2 elevation always had the strongest direct 1 58 1 23 and indirect 0 67 0 25 via climatic and physicochemical factors effects on the key comammox species candidatus nitrospira nitrificans and nitrospira sp sg bin2 3 elevation may drive the high relative abundance of candidatus nitrospira nitrificans avg 12 40 and low relative abundance

16570,the recent discovery of complete ammonia oxidation comammox has increased our understanding of nitrification although comammox has been shown to play an important role in plain wetland ecosystems studies of comammox contribution are still limited in plateau wetland ecosystems here we analyzed the abundance activity community and biogeochemical mechanisms of the comammox bacteria in yunnan kweichow and qinghai tibet plateau wetlands from elevations of 1000 5000 m comammox bacteria were widely distributed in all 16 sediment samples with abundances higher than 0 96 0 26 107 copies g 1 n 16 comammox showed high activity 1 18 0 17 to 1 98 0 08 mg n kg 1 d 1 at high elevation 3000 5000 m and dominated the nitrification process activity contribution 37 20 60 62 the activity contribution of ammonia oxidizing bacteria 1 07 0 08 to 2 79 0 35 mg n kg 1 d 1 dominated the nitrification process 44 55 64 15 in low elevation 1000 3000 m samples all detected comammox nitrospira belonged to clade a while clade b was not detected elevation always had a strongest effect on key comammox species thus we infer that elevation may drive the high relative abundance of the species candidatus nitrospira nitrificans avg 12 40 and the low relative abundance of the species nitrospira sp sg bin2 avg 4 75 in high elevation samples that showed a high comammox activity avg 1 62 mg n kg 1 d 1 and high contribution avg 46 08 to the nitrification process these results indicate that comammox may be an important and currently underestimated microbial nitrification process in plateau wetland ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords plateau wetland sediments elevation ranges comammox activity key comammox species biogeochemical driving pattern 1 introduction nitrification plays an important role in the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle wuchter et al 2006 hayatsu et al 2008 li et al 2018 accounting for 330 tg of nitrogen flux from terrestrial ecosystems kuypers et al 2018 since it was discovered in 1890s winogradsky 1890 the generally accepted canonical nitrification process consists of two steps winogradsky 1890 costa et al 2006 tourna et al 2008 vlaeminck et al 2011 which are driven by ammonia oxidizing archaea bacteria aoa aob nh4 no2 and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob no2 no3 respectively a previous study predicted that complete oxidation of ammonia to nitrate complete ammonia oxidation comammox in one organism is energetically feasible costa et al 2006 in 2015 comammox was first confirmed in metagenomic sequences from enrichment cultures containing the genus nitrospira daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 all currently known comammox bacteria belong to nitrospira sublineage ii van kessel et al 2015 pinto et al 2016 which can be further classified into clade a including subclade a1 and a2 and clade b daims et al 2015 xia et al 2018 comammox widely distributed in both artificial and natural ecosystems such as biological wastewater treatment systems xia et al 2018 agricultural soils wang et al 2019 comammox enrichment reactor zhao et al 2021 and synthetic communities in reactor gottshall et al 2021 forest soils li et al 2020 lake sediments shi et al 2020 riparian zone soils wang et al 2021a and salt marshes wang et al 2021b except comammox enrichment reactor 5 81 108 to 9 04 109 copies g 1 the abundance of comammox bacteria in these natural ecosystems 1 84 105 to 3 19 108 copies g 1 is usually higher than that in these artificial ecosystems 1 16 103 to 6 31 105 copies g 1 moreover a similar trend was observed in the limited activity data of comammox agricultural soils 0 03 to 0 40 mg n kg 1 d 1 wang et al 2020a riparian zones soils 0 04 to 0 86 mg n kg 1 d 1 wang et al 2021a compared with the natural ecosystems artificial ecosystems are always confronted with a heavy nitrogen load kuschk et al 2003 amador et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 therefore comammox may play a more important role in natural ecosystems with less human disturbance and a light nitrogen load wetlands which are important ecosystems for biogeochemical cycles have received increasing attention on a regional and global scale marton et al 2015 zedler and kercher 2005 schuerch et al 2018 the nitrification process has been confirmed to regulate the ecological functions of natural wetlands including removing pollutants purifying water and reducing greenhouse gases globally mcclain et al 2003 morse and bernhardt 2013 zak and grigal 1991 previous studies have analyzed the abundance activity and community structure of comammox bacteria in natural wetland liu et at 2020 wang et al 2021a wang et al 2021b however with the rapid development of human society the nitrogen load of natural wetlands in gradually increasing saunders and kalff 2001 verhoeven et al 2006 zhou et al 2014 therefore it is necessary to apply the research of comammox to plateau wetlands with less human disturbance and light nitrogen load it can be expected that comammox may play an important role in the plateau wetland ecosystem furthermore elevation can drive biogeochemical factors leading to different distributions of microorganisms bryant et al 2008 shen et al 2014 mod et al 2021 elevation has been shown to significantly affect community structure of nitrifier aoa and aob in plateau soils and rivers zhang et al 2009 zhao et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 these results indicate that elevation can drive aoa species to show different adaptation patterns to environmental factors and the differences of these patterns lead to the changes of aoa community in plateau soils zhao et al 2017 the similar results were also found in aob of plateau rivers zhang et al 2019 at present there are few reports about the distribution patterns of comammox bacteria in elevated plateau wetland ecosystems two major plateaus in china the yunnan kweichow and qinghai tibet plateaus are located in the southwest of the country the complex environmental conditions give them different characteristics the qinghai tibet plateau is the highest and most extensive highland in the world and is known as the roof of the world with an average elevation over than 4000 m cui and graf 2009 liu et al 2017 the yunnan kweichow plateau is one of the most developed typical karst areas in the world accordingly there are obvious climatic and geological differences pan et al 2020 these two plateaus contains abundant and diverse wetlands that are of great significance to global terrestrial ecosystems liu et al 2017 ma et al 2020 pan et al 2020 compared with eastern china the low population and backward economic development result in a relatively light nitrogen load into these plateau wetlands li et al 2019a pan et al 2020 here it can be expected that comammox may have an important contribution to nitrification and that there may be a unique biogeochemical driven pattern of the comammox community in summary the objectives of this research were to 1 investigate the abundance activity and community composition of comammox bacteria and compare the contribution of comammox to the nitrification process with canonical nitrifiers aoa and aob in the plateau wetlands and 2 reveal the biogeochemical driven mechanisms of the comammox community in the plateau wetlands for this research 16 sediment samples from the plateau wetlands were

nitrifiers in plateau wetlands based on the qpcr and double inhibition assay the amoa gene abundance and activities of three nitrifiers were established fig 1b the comammox gene abundance ranged from 0 96 0 26 107 to 5 88 0 59 107 copies g 1 in the plateau wetlands the comammox gene abundance showed a positive correlation spearman p 0 05 n 16 supporting information table s4 with the substrate nh4 and did not change substantially with increasing elevation the activity of comammox ranged from 0 35 0 05 to 1 98 0 08 mg n kg 1 d 1 in the plateau wetlands furthermore the comammox activity of the high elevation samples 3000 5000 m samples 9 16 avg 1 62 0 38 mg n kg 1 d 1 was significantly higher paired t test p 0 05 n 8 than that of the low elevation samples 1000 3000 m samples 1 8 avg 0 82 0

higher than aob and aoa in 7 of the 8 high elevation samples paired t test p 0 05 n 7 the activity of aoa 0 19 0 04 to 1 35 0 03 mg n kg 1 d 1 was lower than that of comammox bacteria and aob in all samples except for samples 1 and 7 the activities of the three nitrifiers significantly correlated with elevation and the substrate nh4 spearman p 0 05 n 16 supporting information table s4 these results indicate that comammox is widely distributed in all samples and dominates the nitrification process in the 3000 5000 m samples furthermore elevation and nh4 are key factors affecting the activity of nitrifiers 3 2 biodiversity and community composition of comammox bacteria in the plateau wetlands a total of 320 000 comammox nitrospira sequences 20 000 sequences per sample were obtained from high throughput sequencing these sequences were clustered into 300 otus based on a 0 97 identity threshold value the results demonstrate that the richness of the comammox community increased with elevation richness index 143 1 to 393 2 chao1 estimator 172 4 to 396 1 fig 2 a even though there were significant differences anova p 0 05 n 4 in community richness within the same

activity and contribution were positively correlated with elevation ahm annual heat moisture index and nh4 but negatively correlated with moisture spearman p 0 05 n 16 supporting information table s4 the 23 typical otus constituting 80 60 of the total sequences were used to construct phylogenetic trees and perform circlize analysis comammox clade a 2 bacteria 19 otus 73 43 fig 2c was the dominant cluster when compared with clade a 1 4 otus 7 17 the clade a 2 cluster was affiliated with the metagenome assembled genomes mags species nitrospira sp sg bin1 35 35 sg bin2 25 48 and st bin4 12 60 the clade a 1 cluster was closely related to the species candidatus nitrospira nitrificans 7 17 nitrospira sp sg bin1 and st bin4 of clade a 1 were the dominant species of each elevation range fig 2d the proportion of nitrospira sp sg bin2 otu1 and otu6 decreased with increasing elevation in addition more than 80 of candidatus nitrospira nitrificans otu7 otu9 otu12 and 32 were from high elevation samples 3 3 co occurrence of comammox bacteria in the plateau wetlands the co occurrence of comammox bacteria was explored using network inferences based on 300 otus with significant p value 0 05 correlations nitrospira sp sg bin1 and st bin4 accounted for more than 80 of the total nodes in the three networks fig 3 these two species have the highest closeness centrality avg 0 69 0 64 and always closely interconnected with other species in the three networks the main difference between the low elevation 1000 3000 m samples 1 8 fig 3a and high elevation 3000 5000 m samples 9 16 fig 3b networks was that candidatus nitrospira nitrificans had more negative interaction links 8 to 386 more nodes 11 to 38 and a higher degree value 19 to 136 with increased elevation while nitrospira sp sg bin2 has more positive interaction links 108 to 314 fewer nodes 54 to 11 and a lower degree value 189 to 66 with increased elevation supporting information table s5 moreover most interaction links of candidatus nitrospira nitrificans were negative 213 of 268 while most interaction links of nitrospira sp sg bin2 were positive 251 of 314 in the 16 sample network fig 3c supporting information table s5 this kind of co occurrence pattern maybe caused by interspecific competition and symbiosis the relative abundance of candidatus nitrospira nitrificans increased with elevation while nitrospira sp sg bin2 showed a decreasing trend fig 3d the relative abundance of these two species were significantly correlated with the comammox activity and contribution to nitrification nitrificans positive sg bin2 negative spearman p 0 019 n 16 the high elevation samples with a higher comammox activity and higher contribution to nitrification have more candidatus nitrospira nitrificans avg 12 40 with negative interaction links and less nitrospira sp sg bin2 avg 4 75 with positive interaction links niche differentiation of these key species was possibly caused by the biogeochemical factors in the plateau wetlands 3 4 biogeochemical factors affect key species of comammox bacteria in the plateau wetlands the relationship between key comammox species with biogeochemical factors based on bray curtis distance was analyzed by the mantel test fig 4 a the results indicate that the relative abundances of key species were significantly correlated with elevation mean annual temperature mean annual precipitation ahm nh4 ph moisture and tn although tn is a non significant factor it is closely related to nh4 furthermore spearman s correlation confirmed these results supporting information table s4 results of the variation partitioning analysis demonstrated that the lone explanation of elevation climatic factors elevation and ahm 16 on key species was higher than physicochemical factors nh4 ph moisture and tn 2 and that the interactive explanation was 95 fig 4b this indicates that elevation climatic and physicochemical factors jointly explained the niche differentiation of the two key species path analysis was conducted to determine the effects of biogeochemical factors on key species through structural equation pattern sem fig 4c for candidatus nitrospira nitrificans there were significant direct effects from elevation Î» 1 58 p 0 001 ahm Î» 0 71 p 0 001 nh4 Î» 0 33 p 0 05 ph Î» 0 45 p 0 05 moisture Î» 0 41 p 0 01 and tn Î» 0 21 p 0 001 moreover elevation also had a significant direct effect Î» 1 23 p 0 001 on nitrospira sp sg bin2 the effects of physicochemical factors on nitrospira sp sg bin2 was less than candidatus nitrospira nitrificans the results of total effects showed that elevation was the most important factor as it always had the strongest direct and indirect via climatic and physicochemical factors effects on the key species fig 4d elevation could drive environmental factors and affect niche differentiation of key species in the plateau wetlands the niche difference of key species probably to led to a higher comammox activity and higher contribution to nitrification in the high elevation 3000 5000 m samples 9 16 samples 3 5 linear relationship between key species of comammox bacteria and biogeochemical factors in the plateau wetlands the sem results showed that elevation climatic and physicochemical factors jointly affected the key comammox species with elevation as the most important factor thus the relative abundances of key species were regressed against biogeochemical factors in order to understand their response fig 5 the response of key species to each factor indicates that they have different subsistence patterns with the change of environment because the linear association of the two key species was completely opposite elevation had a significant positive y 0 01x 9 31 r2 0 83 p 0 05 n 16 and negative y 0 01x 31 68 r2 0 87 p 0 05 n 16 linear association with key candidatus nitrospira nitrificans and nitrospira sp sg bin2 respectively the linear association between nh4 and the relative abundances of candidatus nitrospira nitrificans y 2 60x 5 59 r2 0 75 p 0 05 n 16 and nitrospira sp sg bin2 y 3 02x 26 17 r2 0 77 p 0 05 n 16 was the most significant among the physicochemical factors however ahm ph moisture and tn also show a linear relationship with relative abundance 4 discussion we found that comammox was widely distributed in the yunnan kweichow and qinghai tibet plateau wetland ecosystems to the best of our knowledge this is the first report showing that comammox dominates the nitrification process in a plateau wetland ecosystem elevation could drive environmental factors affecting niche differentiation of the key comammox species together these findings contribute to our understanding of biogeochemical cycles and ecological functions of comammox bacteria in terrestrial ecosystems 4 1 comparison of comammox activities abundance and influencing factors between the plateau wetlands and other ecosystems the activity of comammox was determined using a method developed by our research group since this method was only recently described few results of comammox activities have been reported to date however from the limited data the comammox activity and contribution to nitrification 1 18 0 17 to 1 98 0 08 mg n kg 1 d 1 37 20 to 60 62 observed in this study exceeded that in fringe soils 0 19 to 0 45 mg n kg 1 d 1 33 8 to 39 6 which is the primary zone of comammox bacteria in plain wetlands wang et al 2021a meanwhile the comammox bacteria abundance in our research 0 96 0 26 to 5 88 0 59 107 copies g 1 was obviously higher than that in many other ecosystems such as plateau rivers highest 1 25 104 copies l 1 zhang et al 2020 plain wetlands 0 11 to 2 02 106 copies g 1 wang et al 2021b and plain dryland 4 14 104 to 1 65 107 copies g 1 xu et al 2020 our study reports that elevation and ahm promote the activity of comammox and that comammox bacteria have low temperature tolerance the main reason is that elevation can affect microbial activity by affecting the climatic and physicochemical factors which is consistent with previous research lanzÃ©n et al 2016 frindte et al 2019 the low nh4 concentration 1 10 mg kg 1 of plateau wetlands is beneficial to the survival comammox bacteria previous studies have shown that comammox bacteria are widely distributed in low nh4 environments such as freshwater sediments 11 95 mg kg 1 zhang et al 2020 activated sludge 8 75 mg kg 1 wang et al 2021c and rapid sand filters 0 53 mg kg 1 fowler et al 2018 furthermore our results are consistent with a previous study showing that comammox bacteria favored growth in a slightly alkaline environment wang et al 2021b 4 2 unique community structures of comammox bacteria in plateau wetland all comammox sequences in this research belonged to clade a with no clade b sequences detected this agrees with previous studies showing a low or nonexistent abundance of comammox clade b bacteria in other ecosystems including agricultural soils li et al 2019b xu et al 2020 and forest soils shi et al 2018 li et al 2020 recent studies have shown that the amt type ammonia transporters of clade b have a low uptake rate per gram biomass which benefits their survival in fluctuating low ammonium conditions fowler et al 2018 koch et al 2019 xu et al 2020 and supports autotrophic growth in forest soil without ammonium amendment wang et al 2019 therefore clade b maybe not suitable for life in the ammonium stable conditions 1 10 mg kg 1 of the plateau wetland sediments moreover comammox clade a bacteria have more targeted functions than those of clade b including a close relation to reductive tricarboxylic acid rtca cycle the ability to utilize cyanate as an alternative substrate for ammonia oxidation and utilization of hydrogen poghosyan et al 2019 spasov et al 2020 compared with clade a 1 clade a 2 dominated the comammox community of the plateau wetland sediments in this research previous studies have shown that clade a 1 is the dominant cluster in natural water ecosystems freshwater and groundwater pjevac et al 2017 and engineered water systems drinking water systems wang et al 2017 activated sludge wang et al 2021c rapid sand filters fowler et al 2018 while clade a2 is more frequently found in soils and sediments li et al 2020 xu et al 2020 which is consistent with our results in this study there was more clade a 1 candidatus nitrospira nitrificans avg 12 40 and less clade a 2 nitrospira sp sg bin2 avg 4 75 in the high elevation samples 3000 5000 m the relative abundance of these two key species significantly correlated with the comammox activities nitrificans positive sg bin2 negative so far the only available pure culture of clade a bacteria candidatus nitrospira inopinata belongs to clade a 1 kits et al 2017 which means clade a 1 may have a higher cultivability and activity than clade a 2 palomo et a 2018 this may be the reason that the high elevation samples have higher comammox activities and a higher contribution to the nitrification process 4 3 special biogeochemical driven patterns of comammox bacteria in plateau wetland in our study elevation climatic and physicochemical factors explained 95 of the effect on key comammox species there are many studies showing that geographical climatic and physicochemical properties are the main factors driving the differentiation of bacteria on a spatial scale monroy et al 2012 mchugh et al 2017 which is consistent with our results previous studies have shown that elevation is an important source of stress on microbial communities on a spatial scale ettema and wardle 2002 fierer and jackson 2006 fierer et al 2009 causing high fluctuations in temperature precipitation and physicochemical properties our sem results agree with these previous studies in that elevation always had the strongest direct and indirect via climatic and physicochemical factors effects on key comammox species of the physicochemical factors nh4 ph moisture and tn had a great effect on key comammox species in this research these factors also effect comammox community in other ecosystems xu et al 2020 wang et al 2021a wang et al 2021b at the same time specialized survival strategies are necessary for the bacteria of plateau wetlands to withstand the multiple environmental stresses imposed by elevation hernandez et al 2021 the relative abundances of the two key species showed a completely opposite linear association with the factors indicating they have different specialized survival strategies under environmental stress the specialized survival strategy can be driven by species interactions with positive correlations resulting from facilitation mutualism and negative correlations resulting from competition zelezniak et al 2015 durÃ¡n et al 2018 it is possible that nitrospira sp sg bin2 was replaced in the high elevation samples by the competitive and stress tolerant candidatus nitrospira nitrificans which showed a higher comammox activity and higher contribution to the nitrification process 4 4 the differences between comammox bacteria and canonical nitrifiers aoa and aob in the plateau wetlands our results show that both aob and comammox activities were positively correlated with nh4 while the aoa activity was negatively correlated with nh4 these correlations can be explained by kinetic characteristics the nh4 substrate affinity of comammox bacteria ks 60 nm kits et al 2017 and aob ks 0 14 1 9 mm dytczaket al 2008 are obviously higher than aoa ks 0 13 Âµm sonthiphand and limpiyakorn 2011 previous studies also show that aoa are more adapted to nitrogen depleted environments leininger et al 2006 he et al 2007 lehtovirta morley et al 2011 and aob are more adapted to nitrogen rich environments with their eutrophic lifestyle di et al 2009 nicol and schleper 2006 as supported by our results furthermore the higher activity of comammox bacteria compared with aoa and aob may be attributed to the distinctive microaerobic conditions of the plateau wetlands as genomic evidence shows that the metabolic cycles of aoa thaumarchaeal hp hb cycle and aob cbb cycle are oxygen tolerant kÃ¶nneke et al 2014 while that of comammox bacteria reductive rtca cycle is oxygen sensitive campbell et al 2006 in this study the do level in sediments should be very low because it decline sharply with sediment depth this is caused by the limited permeability of oxygen in sediments zhu et al 2020 liu et al 2021 previous studies found that comammox process recovered under low do conditions 0 5 mg l which is caused by increasing oxygen affinity of comammox under the low do conditions bellucci et al 2011 arnaldos et al 2013 liu and wang 2013 keene et al 2017 however low do conditions can inhibit canonical nitrification significantly bae et al 2001 park and noguera 2004 for instance as the do concentration of activated sludge decreased from 4 2 mg l to 0 16 mg l the k do value of aob decreased from 0 71 mg l to 0 39 mg l liu and wang 2015 although the apparent oxygen affinity of the comammox bacteria remains to be measured both the theoretical prediction and genomic studies indicate that they likely adapt to low do conditions costa et al 2006 lawson and lÃ¼cker 2018 many studies of wastewater treatment systems demonstrated that the comammox bacteria adapted well to low do conditions camejo et al 2017 beach and noguera 2019 roots et al 2019 wang et al 2020b furthermore comammox bacteria has special functions under low do conditions such as utilizing formate koch et al 2015 and symbiosis with anammox bacteria to promote nitrogen loss gottshall et al 2021 5 conclusions this study investigated the abundance activities and community of the comammox bacteria in the yunnan kweichow and qinghai tibet plateau wetlands 1000 5000 m highlighting that elevation is the most important driving factor some detailed conclusions are as follows 1 comammox bacteria were widely distributed in sediments samples of the plateau wetlands compared with canonical nitrifiers ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa and bacteria aob comammox bacteria showed high activities 1 18 0 17 to 1 98 0 08 mg n kg 1 d 1 and dominated the nitrification process 37 20 60 62 in the high elevation 3000 5000 m samples 2 elevation always had the strongest direct 1 58 1 23 and indirect 0 67 0 25 via climatic and physicochemical factors effects on the key comammox species candidatus nitrospira nitrificans and nitrospira sp sg bin2 3 elevation may drive the high relative abundance of candidatus nitrospira nitrificans avg 12 40 and low relative abundance of nitrospira sp sg bin2 avg 4 75 in the high elevation samples which showed high comammox activities avg 1 62 mg n kg 1 d 1 and a high contribution avg 46 08 to the nitrification process declaration

16571,the presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps in the environment is primarily the result of discharge of waste including from onsite wastewater treatment systems owtss which are employed by 25 of homes in the united states however the occurrence and removal of ppcps in owtss is not well understood particularly given the large diversity in ppcp compounds as well as in owts designs in this study we monitored 26 different ppcps in 13 full scale nitrogen removing biofilters nrbs an innovative alternative type of owts that utilizes an overlying sand layer and an underlying woodchip sand layer to simultaneously remove nitrogen and other wastewater derived contaminants the specific objectives of this study were i to measure the occurrence of ppcps in septic tank effluent ste that served as an influent to nrbs ii to quantify ppcp removal in three types of nrb configurations n 13 and iii to evaluate ppcp removal with depth and environmental conditions in nrbs aqueous samples were taken during 42 separate sampling events during 2016 2019 and analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis of the ste samples yielded detection of 23 of the 26 ppcps with caffeine being the most abundant and frequently detected compound at 52 000 ng l range 190 181 000 ng l followed by acetaminophen and paraxanthine at 47 500 ng l 190 160 000 ng l and 34 300 ng l 430 210 000 ng l respectively cimetidine fenofibrate and warfarin were the only compounds not detected the average removal of ppcps by nrbs ranged from 58 to 99 for the various compounds ppcp removal as a function of depth in the systems showed that 50 to 99 of the observed removal was achieved within the top oxic layer 0 46 cm of the nrbs for 19 analytes seven of the compounds had 85 removal by the same depth these results indicate that nrbs are effective at removing ppcps and that a large portion of the removal is achieved within the oxic nitrifying layer of the nrbs overall the removal of ppcps in nrbs was comparable n 8 or better n 15 than that observed for conventional wastewater treatment plants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pharmaceuticals and personal care products onsite wastewater treatment lc ms ms nitrogen removing biofilters septic tank 1 introduction pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps can include prescription drugs e g sulfamethoxazole and fluoxetine over the counter medications e g acetaminophen components of common household products e g deet as well as chemical additives e g tcep as common components of household industrial and agricultural wastewater ppcps are transported to wastewater treatment facilities and ultimately dispensed to surface or groundwaters with treated effluent at compound dependent concentrations typically in the Âµg l range aymerich et al 2016 benotti and brownawell 2007 jelic et al 2010 the study of transport and fate of ppcps in these environments is of interest for several reasons including the effects of human exposure via drinking water tambosi et al 2010 rx list 2021 schwab et al 2005 henkel 2008 the development and horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes kelly and brooks 2018 world health organization 2015 the use of ppcps as tracers of sewage bendz et al 2005 oppenhiemer et al 2011 wolf et al 2012 and sublethal effects particularly endocrine disrupting and behavioral of ppcps on aquatic organisms melvin 2017 nash et al 2004 because ppcps in ground and well water are primarily the result of wastewater effluent discharge from wastewater treatment plants wwtps and onsite wastewater treatment systems owts sui et al 2015 del rosario et al 2014 gao et al 2019 the study of ppcp removal in these systems is critical for improving water quality while removal by wwtps has been the focus of many ppcp studies benotti and brownawell 2007 zhang et al 2014 sui et al 2010 ryu et al 2014 jelic et al 2010 miege et al 2009 25 of houses in the u s are still served by septic systems nowra 2018 and in some regions the percentage of unsewered houses is as high as 75 kelly mcgovern 2019 this underscores the importance of improving our understanding of ppcp removal by owtss a variety of ppcps are commonly detected in septic tank effluent ste at ng l and even Âµg l levels godfrey 2004 du et al 2014 matamoros et al 2009 del rosario et al 2014 indicating that in general removal of these contaminants by septic tanks alone is poor a study by du et al 2014 made direct comparisons of removal of 14 ppcps by septic tanks a conventional wwtp and a wetland system coupled to a septic tank in every case the wwtp and the wetland system had better removals than the septic tank studies by conn et al 2010 and wilcox et al 2009 reported high removals of caffeine acetaminophen and paraxanthine compounds known to degrade well under oxic conditions jim et al 2006 xue et al 2010 blair et al 2015 in leach fields a variety of alternative owtss including sand beds and constructed wetlands have been studied as upgrades from and additions to simple septic systems ppcp removal in such alternative systems is typically similar to removal measured in conventional wwtps du et al 2014 heufelder 2014 li et al 2014 llorens et al 2009 matamoros et al 2009 schaider et al 2017 however there is a huge variety of owts types and comparison of ppcp removal in owtss with various designs can help to establish essential characteristics of systems that effectively remove ppcps a survey of the literature on ppcp removal by various owts indicates that the most successful systems often have designs that prioritize a few key features that are in alignment with understood mechanisms of removal for a variety of ppcps three of the most studied removal mechanisms are i aerobic biodegradation ii anaerobic or suboxic biodegradation and iii sorption blair et al 2015 monsalvo et al 2014 alvarino et al 2014 additional mechanisms including fugal degradation vasiliadou et al 2016 rodrÃ­guez rodrÃ­guez et al 2012 cruz morato et al 2013 and abiotic chemical reactions wirth et al 1998 hardie et al 2009 bosetto et al 2006 have also been studied in the past but further research is needed to explore their potential for ppcp removal in owtss sorption is reversible and once breakthrough occurs further loss may be attributed to degradation processes many compounds including acetaminophen and caffeine are known to be efficiently removed under oxic conditions jim et al 2006 xue et al 2010 blair et al 2015 while others like the antibiotics trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole have been shown to be readily degraded by anaerobic and denitrifying communities xue et al 2010 lakshminarasimman et al 2018 although some ppcps are successfully biodegraded under either condition most have significantly more effective degradation by one or the other lakshminarasimman et al 2018 alvarino et al 2014 and thus the redox conditions within owtss may heavily impact ppcp removal additionally since the mechanism and efficiency of ppcp removal varies considerably between compounds owts with higher diversity of conditions and therefore microbial communities tend to be more successful at overall ppcp removal hijosa valsero et al 2010 nitrogen removing biofilters nrbs are innovative owtss designed to target nitrogen removal via sequential nitrification denitrification gobler et al 2021 the resulting diversity of redox conditions within the system gives it the potential to effectively remove a variety of organic contaminants even recalcitrant ones like 1 4 dioxane lee et al 2021 nrbs are in ground vertical flow systems consisting of a ste dispersion mat spread over a 46 centimeter unsaturated and therefore primarily oxic sand layer which in turn overlays a 46 centimeter sand and woodchip layer where suboxic conditions are maintained through saturation fig 1 a recent study examined nitrogen removal by nrbs finding that all sampled systems n 10 removed total nitrogen tn by 80 to effluent values 10 mg n l gobler et al 2021 this work aims to explore the occurrence and the removal of 26 ppcps table s1 in 13 full scale nrbs installed in the field specifically by i measuring ppcp occurrence and concentration in thirteen stes ii quantifying ppcp removal in these nrbs and iii examining the depth profile of ppcp removal in nrbs and considering its implications regarding mechanisms possibly contributing to ppcp removal we hypothesize that nrbs will perform as well as or even better than conventional wwtps to remove ppcps because the availability of both oxic and suboxic conditions within one system and long retention times are expected to promote biodegradation of a wide range of ppcps by supporting diverse microbial communities furthermore biofilm build up may allow additional sorption in the system as a temporary sink for ppcps the results of this study will contribute to the limited literature on ppcp occurrence and removal in owtss by providing data from a novel system featuring both oxic and suboxic zones and long hydraulic retention times hrts 2 methods 2 1 chemicals and materials lc ms grade

isotope standards for all 24 ppcps detected in this study was made up in methanol at a concentration of 50 Âµg l of each compound it was stored in an amber glass vial to reduce light exposure and kept at 18 c a 20 Âµl spike of this stock solution was added to each sample and blank directly after the filtration step as detailed below 2 2 nrb designs the generalized nrb design includes a ste dispersal system two separate layers of filtering material and lysimeters or linings for sample collection the three variations on this design are illustrated in fig 1 and described below in nine of the systems ste is dispersed across the top of the nrb by a geomat matrix installed approximately 15 cm below the ground surface in the remaining four systems l3 l4 l6 and l7 the dispersal system consists of piping and gravel from there the wastewater trickles through the upper unsaturated nitrifying layer which consists of 46 cm of c33 sand nitrified effluent from the first layer is then filtered through a second 46 cm denitrifying layer consisting of a 50 50 mixture of c33 sand and woodchips within the nrb samples were collected in lysimeters installed at 15 cm below the geomat at the bottom of the 46 cm sand layer and at the bottom of the denitrifying layer the three variations on the nrb system studied here differ in the design of their second denitrifying layer fig 1 and will be referred to as unlined lined and woodchip box systems unlined nrbs have the simplest design with two vertically stacked 46 cm layers and three lysimeters for sample collection fig 1a unlined systems rely on reduced hydraulic flow due to high material density to achieve a saturated denitrification layer and therefore may not be completely anoxic however a study by gobler et al 2021 showed unlined nrbs to be as effective at denitrification as lined or woodchip box systems lined systems are identical to unlined nrbs but with the addition of a plastic liner installed around the entire denitrifying layer fig 1b saturated and therefore suboxic conditions were maintained in the lined denitrifying layer via a pvc standpipe with an opening level to the top of the denitrifying layer in lined nrbs lysimeters were placed at the 15 cm and 46 cm depths for sample collection while the liner collects and feeds the system effluent to the pvc pipe for sampling finally woodchip box systems have a spatially separated denitrifying zone fig 1c a liner around the nitrifying layer collects the nitrified effluent which is carried by gravity to the bottom of a 3785 l tank of woodchips the wastewater then flows upward through the woodchips to the effluent sampling pipe this up flow design keeps the woodchip box saturated and therefore suboxic 2 3 sample sites nrbs were installed in massachusetts at the massachusetts alternative septic system test center masstc and in suffolk county ny at single home county properties the masstc facility diverts sewage from upstream of a sewage treatment plant thereby feeding the nrbs with wastewater from a small sewershed including a county jail and a military base the nrbs installed in ny are each fed by sewage from a single home in all cases wastewater was pumped first to a septic tank with a holding time of 2 3 days before application to the surface of the nrb a total of 13 separate nrbs were sampled for this study including five lined systems two at masstc three in ny six unlined systems three at masstc and three in ny and two woodchip box systems one each at masstc and ny 2 4 sampling methods a total of 42 sampling events were conducted the number of sampling timepoints at each nrb are given in table s2 all samples were taken quarterly and dates are given in table s3 ste lysimeter lys and effluent eff samples were taken on the same day for each sampling event 100 ml ste samples were taken as a grab sample from the septic tank for each system hrt in the septic tanks was 2 3 days at all sites lys and eff waters were collected passively over the course of 2 days prior to sampling and 500 ml samples were taken the hrt in the nrbs is estimated at 4 5 days gobler et al 2021 which makes this sampling scheme non ideal for the direct comparison of ppcps in the ste and eff samples because ppcp concentrations in ste have large temporal variability directly comparable ste and eff samples would require measurement of the same parcel of wastewater first when it is in the septic tank and then 4 5 days later when it reaches the nrb eff the sampling method used in this study was designed to coordinate ppcp sampling along with closer to steady state wastewater components including nitrogen and bod gobler et al 2021 ideally ste and eff samples would have been taken on separate days in order to account for the hrt of the systems without extending the composite time of the eff samples methods for estimating removals given this complication are discussed and compared in the results and discussion section below samples were collected in amber glass bottles 250 ml for ste 1 l for lys and eff bottles were cleaned prior to sampling by soaking overnight in a trisodium phosphate bath followed by an overnight acid soak in 1 hcl a methanol rinse and drying in an oven at 100 c samples were stored on ice during transport to the laboratory where they were immediately filtered using glass microfiber filters 47 mm whatman spiked with isotopes and stored at 4 c until spe loading was completed within 24 hrs 2 5 sample extraction cleanup and analysis approximately 100 ml of ste samples and 500 ml of lys and eff samples were filtered using 47 mm glass fiber filters whatman immediately after filtering samples were spiked with the isotope standards and weighed within 24 hrs all samples were loaded onto oasis hlb spe cartridges 6cc 500 mg waters which had been preconditioned with 6 ml methanol followed by 6 ml milliq water cartridges were dried and then stored at 18 c until analysis samples were eluted under gravity with 6 ml methanol and 6 ml methanol with 0 1 trifluoroacetic acid and then evaporated under nitrogen gas ultrapure airgas pa usa to a volume of 100 Âµl samples were then brought up to a total of 1 ml in a mixture of 90 10 water methanol with vortexing centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm weighed and transferred to autosampler vials for analysis using pasture pipettes according to the analysis methods outlined below a portion of the samples were analyzed on a instrument with heightened sensitivity those samples were not concentrated after elution in order to prevent saturation of the detector instead a 90 Âµl aliquot of these samples was brought up to a total of 1 ml in a mixture of 90 10 water methanol in an autosampler vial two separate instruments were used in the analysis for this study due to availability samples analyzed in 2018 used an agilent high performance liquid chromatography system coupled with an agilent 6224a time of flight mass spectrometer lc tof ms in the chemistry department of state university of new york stony brook sbu a comparison of instrument performances is further discussed in the supplemental information samples analyzed in 2020 used an agilent hplc coupled with an agilent 6495b triple quadrupole mass spectrometer lc ms ms provided by the new york state center for clean water technology ccwt at sbu all samples were separated using a waters cortecs c18 column 2 1 150 mm 2 7 Âµm pore size with a guard column of the same material the method was slightly adjusted from a previously published method by mullen 2018 solvents used were a 0 1 formic acid in milliq water and b a 50 50 methanol acetonitrile mixture 10 Âµl injection volumes were used for all samples on both instruments the gradient started at 98 solvent a and 2 solvent b and linearly changed to 100 solvent b over a 25 minute period the ratio was maintained for 3 min before returning to the initial conditions over a 3 minute period a flow rate of 0 4 ml min was used for all samples six minutes between runs were allowed for post run re equilibration retention times and ionization information for all compounds are provided in table s4 all data were quantified using the agilent masshunter quantitative analysis software 2 6 quality control surrogate standards were added to each sample prior to spe loading and used to monitor and correct for the method recovery average isotope recoveries in ste samples were between 55 105 for all compounds except sulfamethoxazole 37 and warfarin 44 table s1 the recoveries for sulfamethoxazole and warfarin were comparable to other studies for wastewater sample analysis katz et al 2010 godfrey et al 2007 and were therefore used to correct concentrations nicotine was also monitored during this study but due to isotope recoveries 400 those results are not reported isotope recoveries in eff and lys samples were between 60 120 for all compounds except sulfamethoxazole 53 which was treated in the same way as the ste samples additionally the ratio of the quantifier ion to the qualifier ion of each compound both native and isotope in the samples was compared to the ratio of the quantifier ion to the qualifier ion of the same compound in the calibration standards the results are listed in table s5 in all cases the average percent difference was 20 frequent field lab and solvent blanks were analyzed and all detections were consistently less than one third of the detection limit for each compound a delay column was used to minimize deet and tcep background detection limits dl were calculated from the lowest detected sample by scaling the response to a signal to noise ratio of 3 1 detection limits in ste samples are approximately five times higher than those in lys and eff samples because of their relative concentration factors 2 7 ppcp removal calculations in this manuscript data are reported for all compounds in order to contribute to the literature even for infrequently detected ppcps but reported removals are categorized based on detection frequency and ste concentration of the analyte to help define the level of confidence in their approximation of the reality of ppcp attenuation in nrbs with these conditions removals reported in this manuscript are calculated without the inclusion of dl data and therefore represent a lower limit on the real removal achieved by nrbs the removal for a given ppcp at one nrb site referred to as combined removal was calculated according to the equation r s i t e 1 s t e s i t e 1 e f f s i t e 1 s t e s i t e 1 100 where rsite 1 is the removal at one nrb site across all sampling dates stesite 1 is the median ste ppcp concentration across all sampling dates at the nrb site and effsite1 is the median eff ppcp concentration across all sampling dates at the nrb site future work using controlled influent on lab scale systems based on the nrb design will help verify these results by providing a comparison to data that is not limited by detection frequencies or influent concentrations 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of ppcps in ste the detection frequency of ppcps in stes measured in this study table 1 varied by compound especially at single home nrbs with many non prescription ppcps having 90 detection and twelve of the less frequently prescribed drugs having 20 detection across all samples table 1 for example caffeine and deet were the only compounds found in every ste sample taken and cimetidine fenofibrate and warfarin had no detections in any ste samples ppcp concentrations varied as well but generally the ste concentrations determined in this study table 1 were in agreement with ranges found in the literature for ste concentrations conn et al 2010 matamoros et al 2009 schaider et al 2017 the highest overall average ste concentrations were found for non prescription ppcps including acetaminophen 47 000 44 000 ng l caffeine 52 000 48 000 ng l paraxanthine 34 000 45 000 ng l deet 29 000 50 000 ng l cotinine 8400 19 900 ng l and ranitidine 9600 8200 ng l additional compounds with average ste concentrations over 1000 ng l include diphenhydramine 5500 15 000 ng l diltiazem 1300 2600 ng l diclofenac 5400 4700 ng l and the prescription drugs sulfamethoxazole 2900 2900 ng l and propranolol 1000 600 ng l the remaining detected analytes averaged 100 1000 ng l in the ste while tcep salbutamol and primidone averaged 100 ng l ranitidine which had higher ste concentrations in this work than have been reported in the literature schaider et al 2017 gao et al 2019 was only detected in the ste at one single home nrb site it was detected at high levels 7200 140 000 ng l in all three samples taken at that site variability in ste concentrations across all nrb sites is discussed further below 3 2 ppcp removal in nrbs the discussion below includes comparison of nrb performance to wwtps in general and also particularly to trickling filter tf systems tfs are considered here as directly comparable to nrbs because both systems rely on fixed microbial communities as opposed to the suspended communities in batch reactor systems and biofilm buildup which can support diverse microenvironments fig 2 shows combined removals for each of the 23 analytes detected in both ste and eff samples in all studied nrbs with three subplots separating the ppcps by the confidence of the results based on their frequency of occurrence and concentration levels the plots are overlaid with comparison data from the literature on ppcp removals in tf systems table s6 highest confidence is attributed to results for frequently occurring compounds that were detected at 38 or more of the 13 nrb sites and had average ste concentrations higher than 600 ng l n 9 results for compounds that were detected at 31 38 of the sites or had ste concentrations lower than 400 ng l n 6 are considered to have intermediate confidence lower confidence is attributed to results for compounds detected at less than 31 of the nrb sites or with average ste concentrations below 200 ng l n 8 fig 2a contains the eight compounds with highest confidence caffeine paraxanthine and acetaminophen are consistently very well removed by the nrbs with average removals of 99 98 and 96 respectively across all systems these agree well with removals reported in conventional wwtps for caffeine and acetaminophen zhang et al 2014 benotti and brownawell 2007 and as can be seen in fig 2a they are higher than removal found in tf systems in almost all cases ejhed et al 2018 camacho muÃ±oz et al 2012 mai et al 2016 petrie et al 2017 bartelt hunt et al 2009 lee and rasmussen 2006 trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole cotinine diphenhydramine and deet all average 80 removal in the nrbs which is similar to removals reported at conventional wwtps for cotinine heufelder 2014 benotti and brownawell 2007 and considerably higher than removals reported for the remaining compounds e g deet and sulfamethoxazole are reportedly removed between 60 70 sui et al 2010 ryu et al 2014 heufelder 2014 hijosa valsero et al 2011 and trimethoprim and diphenhydramine are often removed 30 jelic et al 2010 miege et al 2009 ryu et al 2014 removals determined in this study are also similar to and often better than those found in studies of tf systems burns et al 2018 brandt et al 2013 faleye et al 2019 camacho muÃ±oz et al 2012 mai et al 2016 johnson et al 2017 bartelt hunt et al 2009 lee and rasmussen 2006 fig 2b contains results for the six compounds with intermediate confidence the average removal in nrbs for these compounds ranged from 94 for atenolol to 62 for salbutamol however even with the increase in the removal range from plot a these compounds still have generally equal or better removal in the nrb systems compared to tf systems burns et al 2018 ejhed et al 2018 falas et al 2012 petrie et al 2017 lee and rasmussen 2006 of these atenolol ketoprofen and salbutamol have a range 30 90 of removals reported in the literature for conventional wwtps zhang et al 2014 jelic et al 2010 benotti and brownawell 2007 miege et al 2009 while metoprolol tcep and diltiazem are typically poorly 0 30 removed jelic et al 2010 benotti and brownawell 2007 miege et al 2009 ryu et al 2014 finally in fig 2c are data for 8 ppcps with lower confidence in calculating their removal due to infrequent detection again the removal by nrb was in all cases in the same range or higher than removals found for tf systems burns et al 2018 ejhed et al 2018 falas et al 2012 comber et al 2019 lajeunesse et al 2012 removal by conventional wwtp was between 60 70 for primidone and ciprofloxacin he et al 2015 ryu et al 2014 which is slightly higher than the 59 and 48 average removals reported here propranolol and diclofenac have removals ranging from 10 to 90 in conventional wwtps gabet giraud et al 2010 zhang et al 2014 carbamazepine and fluoxetine are reported to be recalcitrant 30 removal in wwtps zhang et al 2014 jelic et al 2010 benotti and brownawell 2007 fluoxetine was measured at two nrb sites with removals of 64 and 68 carbamazepine was detected at a total of six sites and had removals between 75 94 at three sites 2 removal at one site and negative removals at the remaining two sites the negative removals are not included in the figure and carbamazepine is included in fig 2c primarily because the range of measured removals is not well represented by a box and whisker plot negative removals for carbamazepine are commonly reported in the literature and may be attributed to deconjugation of metabolites to the parent compound blair et al 2015 verlicchi et al 2012 or in the case of this study to the combination of low ste concentrations and temporal ste variability that was not accounted for in the sampling plan many ppcps have low sorption coefficients and are widely reported to have minimal loss to sorption during municipal wastewater treatment log koc and log kow values are included in table s1 jelic et al 2010 monsalvo et al 2014 yan et al 2014 maszkowska et al 2014 and to be transported hundreds of meters in groundwater benotti and brownawell 2009 however some compounds have been reported to have high kd values such as fluoxetine kd 1200 l kg 1 diltiazem kd 585 l kg 1 and ranitidine kd 350 430 l kg 1 blair et al 2015 benotti and brownawell 2009 these compounds are expected to have higher loss to the solid phase during wastewater treatment and have been reported to have limited transport in groundwater plumes benotti and brownawell 2009 sorption of ppcps in nrbs is likely a combination of adsorption to sites on the surface of material components i e sand woodchips distribution system material and lining material as well as sorption to biofilms formed on these materials therefore while ppcp removal via this mechanism is largely dependent on the sorption coefficient of the compound material surface area and charge and the presence of biofilms torresi et al 2017 are environmental factors that can influence sorption sorption is expected to play a role in the temporary removal of ppcps from onsite wastewater and future research with controlled column experiments may further reveal the role of adsorption in the overall removal of these contaminants the comparable or greater removal of ppcps from the ste to the eff in nrbs as contrasted with conventional wwtps may be due in part to the hrt of these owtss which at 4 5 days is considerably longer than the 1 day used in most municipal wwtps the extended hrt is hypothesized to help compensate the slow biodegradation rate for many ppcps in nrbs thus enhancing their removal compared to conventional wwtps we also speculate the long hrts may allow promotion of less selectivity and therefore more diversity within the microbial community in addition to extended hrt mineralogical components of the sand particularly iron and manganese oxides may catalyze chemical reaction pathways important to the removal of ppcps that are amines or carbonyls de carvalho et al 2006 wirth et al 1998 hardie et al 2009 bosetto et al 2006 potentially relevant abiotic reactions have been studied previously and further research is needed to clarify the role they may play in the observed removal of ppcps in nrbs finally it is possible that the microbial diversity even within only the upper layer of an nrb system as reported by langlois 2020 improves the overall performance with respect to ppcp removal wwtps are designed to optimize the removal of specifically targeted wastewater components bod pathogens nutrients etc which can limit ppcp removal to compounds degradable under the defined conditions the more natural nrb systems target conditions for nitrogen removal but may simultaneously allow for the formation of microenvironments with diverse conditions either within biofilms or along differential flow paths gobler et al 2021 this means that compounds resistant to one degradation mechanism still have potential to be removed these hypotheses are further explored below using depth profiles of ppcp removal in nrbs 3 3 confidence in calculated removals and confounding factors temporal variability of ste ppcp concentrations is a challenge posed by data from single home owtss in this study and in the literature the far from steady state ste concentration of most ppcps is primarily due to the limited sewage source at such sites which has two main effects on the data first the occurrence of ppcps in single home systems is limited by the small number of occupants available to potentially use each ppcp which can drastically affect the detection frequency second single home systems lack the high levels of dilution seen at wwtps with expansive sewersheds which can increase the maximum detected ppcp concentrations entering an owts therefore depending on the compound ste concentration at a single site can vary from below the detection limit to high levels Âµg l from one sampling event to the next these effects are illustrated by the data from this study in fig 3 for select compounds and in the ranges of the ste concentrations provided in table 1 for all detected ppcps as the distributions in fig 3 indicate in this study it was found that much of the variability in ste concentration could be accounted for by separating samples by nrb site often dropping the rsd from 100 to below 70 it is valuable to explore the effects of ste concentration and detection frequency on the calculated removals in this study in order to assess the validity of the results and consider best practices for analyzing similar data to accomplish this removals were calculated both as a direct comparison of ste and eff samples taken during a single sampling event referred to as individual removal and also as a comparison of the median ste and eff concentration across all sampling events at a single nrb site combined removal used throughout this study in both cases the removals were calculated with and without the inclusion of eff data points with ppcp concentrations below the detection limit when those points were included they were included as the detection limit value for the compound the resulting removals are provided in table 1 for all detected ppcps ordered by detection frequency the results show that for compounds like caffeine and deet which have high detection frequencies 100 for both and high ste concentrations 52 000 48 000 ng l and 29 000 50 000 ng l respectively the calculated removal is largely unaffected by the method of calculation varying between 99 99 8 between the four values for caffeine and between 84 87 for deet however as detection frequency and ste concentration drop it becomes more likely that the various calculations yield differing values as is seen for salbutamol df 31 ste concentration 180 230 ng l with removal values between 59 80 for the four calculation methods and ketoprofen df 18 ste concentration 83 32 ng l which ranges between 61 91 removal the magnitude of the ste concentration was found to affect the calculated removal to some extent since particularly low ste concentrations 100 ng l paired with eff detection limits around 10 ng l average for all ppcps 18 ng l range 3 192 ng l limited the extent of measurable ppcp loss therefore overall this data set suggests that higher confidence in a calculated removal may be merited when detection frequency and ste concentrations are high based on this result it is recommended that studies of ppcp removal by owtss may benefit from composite sampling over the hrt of the system or repeated sampling over a large time period for a comparison of median ste and eff values as was used in this study 3 4 ppcp removal as a function of depth in nrbs ppcp attenuation with depth in the nrbs was investigated as a first step in exploring potential mechanisms of removal to relate remediation of individual ppcps to the different environmental conditions of the nrb layers this study does not provide conclusive evidence of the contributions of any particular mechanisms but the hypotheses formed from this data may inform future experiments for further exploration of the roles of sorption biodegradation and chemical reaction in ppcp removal by nrbs analytes were grouped by the extent of their removal in the nitrifying oxic layer and then by their additional removal in the denitrifying suboxic layer concentrations with depth of representative compounds are shown in fig 4 and are provided for all analytes in table s7 previously 10 of the 13 nrbs surveyed here were monitored for total nitrogen tn removal and were reported to reduce tn by an average of 83 94 over the multi year sampling period gobler et al 2021 the average eff tn concentrations were below 9 mg n l in all cases confirming that the studied nrbs provided ideal conditions for both nitrification oxic top layer and denitrification suboxic bottom layer processes this provides opportunities for the removal of ppcps under both aerobic and suboxic conditions in the systems this does not exclude the potential for ppcp removal by alternative mechanisms which is recommended for future study the first group is composed of five compounds that showed near complete removal within the top nitrifying layer suggesting aerobic biodegradation may be an important mechanism represented by acetaminophen 93 removed by the 46 cm lysimeter and cotinine 92 in fig 4a and b respectively this group also contains caffeine 98 deet 86 and venlafaxine 98 although venlafaxine had only 3 detection frequency across the 39 ste samples aerobic biodegradation of each of these ppcps has been reported in the literature with complete and rapid loss for acetaminophen caffeine and deet in a variety of experimental designs jim et al 2006 gimeno et al 2016 brown and wong 2018 lakshminarasimman et al 2018 and reduction of cotinine bradley et al 2007 in oxic stream sediments and wwtp systems studies in the literature suggest sorption and biosorption will not significantly affect these compounds jim et al 2006 monsalvo et al 2014 musson et al 2010 and these processes would likely provide only a temporary sink and so consistent removal in samples taken multiple years after system installation could suggest aerobic biodegradation as the primary mechanism of removal excluding venlafaxine all ppcps in this group had 58 detections and ste concentrations 1000 ng l with the exception of deet which dropped in median concentration from 6000 ng l 740 99 000 ng l to 1200 ng l 19 8000 ng l all of these compounds had concentrations below 200 ng l by the 46 cm lysimeter for ppcps in this group further removal in the denitrifying layers was not observed either due to a lack of additional attenuation deet or to analytical difficulty in distinguishing between concentrations nearing the detection limit acetaminophen caffeine cotinine and venlafaxine five of the studied compounds had 52 84 removal in the nitrifying layer and showed little to no additional removal in the denitrification layer therefore having overall intermediate removals in the nrbs fig 4c shows this pattern for tcep and similar results were obtained for salbutamol ciprofloxacin diclofenac and primidone with total final removals of 61 62 48 84 and 59 respectively concentrations with depth given in table s7 of this group tcep and salbutamol were the only compounds with detection frequencies above 20 and both of them had median ste concentrations 100 ng l further study of these compounds in a lab scale setting with controlled influent would be beneficial for improving our understanding of their removal however the removals reported in this study are similar to those reported in the literature for these compounds in oxic systems dorival garcia et al 2013 xue et al 2010 alvarino et al 2014 jim et al 2006 there are references which suggest diclofenac and ciprofloxacin could be partially removed by anaerobic communities xue et al 2010 dorival garcia et al 2013 implying the lack of additional removal by the suboxic denitrifying layer in this work could be due to typically slower degradation rates by anaerobic processes coupled with relatively short hrt in the nrb compared to the studies in which anaerobic degradation was demonstrated or again due to an analytical inability to differentiate between the low concentrations found in the 46 cm lys and 92 cm eff samples for these compounds that had already low starting concentrations in the ste samples the third compound group is composed of 12 ppcps which showed substantial removal in the denitrifying layer of the nrbs as demonstrated in fig 4d e and f for representative compounds trimethoprim atenolol and metoprolol and for the remaining compounds in table s7 two compounds in this group carbamazepine and fluoxetine had 70 total removal in the nrbs and in both cases all removal was found to occur within the denitrifying layers in fact the average removal at the 46 cm lysimeter samples was negative for both compounds negative removal of carbamazepine has been found in the literature and is generally attributed to deconjugation blair et al 2015 verlicchi et al 2012 there could also be discrepancies in the reported values due to the non comprehensive nature of samples collected by lysimeter poor removal of carbamazepine and fluoxetine in anoxic environments has been reported in the literature alvarino et al 2014 monsalvo et al 2014 carbamazepine is generally reported to be highly recalcitrant under both oxic and anoxic conditions lakshminarasimman et al 2018 xue et al 2010 findings for fluoxetine are variable a study by alvarino et al 2014 found better removal of fluoxetine in an oxic conventional activated sludge cas system 80 with partial removal in an upflow suboxic sludge blanket 10 however a study by benotti and brownawell 2007 found only 7 5 removal of fluoxetine in a wwtp employing cas thus the fluoxetine removal measured in nrbs is consistent with the literature and further study yielding additional data points may help clarify the capability of nrbs in removing this compound the remaining 10 compounds in this third group each had 47 average removal by the bottom of the nitrifying sand layer except a 29 removal for ketoprofen and no lys samples with lamotrigine detections and had an additional 9 82 removal occur between the 46 cm lysimeter sample and the final effluent fig 4d e and f shows this removal pattern for trimethoprim atenolol and metoprolol respectively table s7 additional ppcps with similar results include diltiazem diphenhydramine ketoprofen lamotrigine paraxanthine propranolol and sulfamethoxazole in the case of paraxanthine this pattern is driven by data from the unlined nrbs which given their potentially only partially saturated denitrifying layers are the most likely to support some amount of aerobic biodegradation in the primarily suboxic environment thus the mechanism of additional removal for paraxanthine is not definitive based on previous studies in the literature paraxanthine is readily degradable in oxic bioreactors and is likely to degrade though more slowly in suboxic systems as well similarly to its parent compound caffeine bradley et al 2007 the 10 compounds grouped here are described in the literature as moderately biodegradable under both oxic and anoxic conditions monsalvo et al 2014 alvarino et al 2014 suarez et al 2010 blair et al 2015 wu et al 2010 brown and wong 2018 tang et al 2020 which supports the results of this study where partial removal in the nitrification layer was found followed by additional removal in the suboxic denitrifying zones of the 42 sampling events included in this study only six yielded enough volume in the 6 in lysimeter for ppcp analysis therefore while data from this depth is included in fig 4 more data points are required for the interpretation of the removal within the top 6 in of the nrbs however it is worthy to note that when available removal by the 6 in lysimeter correlated well with removal by the 46 cm lysimeter this suggests that removal activity in the nitrification layer occurs primarily within the upper 15 cm of the sand this result is supported by a study by langlois 2020 which showed that most of the microbial biomass in the nitrifying layer of nrbs is located in the top 3 cm of the sand it could also be explained by sorption to the dispersal system materials or the nrb sand collectively these results indicate that a significant portion of removal for many of the analytes is occurring in the upper 46 cm of the sand layer for 19 of the detected ppcps more than 50 of the total observed removal occurred within the nitrifying layer and for 10 of those it was 90 while aerobic biodegradation is a likely contributor in most of these cases and the removal by sorption and chemical reaction is not defined by this study it is also hypothesized that anaerobic suboxic denitrifying organisms residing within microenvironments protected by biofilms may be present in the primarily oxic nitrifying layer and could play a role in ppcp removal this hypothesis is supported by a study by gobler et al 2021 that found partial reduction in tn by the bottom of the nitrifying layer in nrbs the nitrogen removal suggested the occurrence of denitrification in the nitrifying layer and is consistent with the theory of suboxic microenvironments gobler et al 2021 although alternative pathways e g nitrate reduction coupled to iron oxidation nrfo or iron reduction coupled to ammonium reduction to n2 are also possible future work based on these results could further clarify the role of these mechanisms and thereby inform owts designs for optimization of ppcp removal 3 5 ppcp removal by nrb type the extent of ppcp removal achieved by woodchip box unlined and lined nrbs was compared to assess any benefits of the three different denitrification layer designs the comparison is not statistical due to the limited amount of data currently available for the three nrb types fig 5 shows combined removals grouped by nrb type for caffeine cotinine metoprolol and diphenhydramine these four compounds were chosen for comparison because they have detected concentrations for at least four lined and at least four unlined systems and together they demonstrate the variability of the reported removals concentrations provided in table s7 overall the data set shows little indication of a substantial difference in the ppcp removal achieved by woodchip box lined and unlined nrbs gobler et al 2021 found successful tn removal in all nrb installations included in this work and found nrb type to have little effect on the total removal with 83 87 and 84 removed in lined woodchip box and unlined nrbs respectively removal of 1 4 dioxane in six of the same nrbs was reported to be higher in unlined nrbs than in lined or woodchip box systems lee et al 2021 the difference was attributed to additional aerobic biodegradation of 1 4 dioxane in unlined nrbs due to a lack of saturation in the denitrifying layer since most of the ppcps were removed to a large extent within the nitrifying layer it is reasonable that the differences in the denitrifying layer as the defining factor between nrb types did not drastically change the overall ppcp removal caffeine cotinine and metoprolol do appear to have more variance in unlined versus lined nrbs fig 5 this may be due to some variability in the conditions of the system because of the lack of lining separating the nrb layers from the surrounding ground it could also be the result of non uniform sampling due to the use of lysimeters for final effluent collection in unlined systems as opposed to the lined system which combines the final effluent from the entire area of lined nrbs prior to sampling further sampling is needed before a conclusion can be drawn on the relative extent of ppcp removal in different types of nrbs but these current data suggest ppcp removal in lined nrbs is more consistent and possibly higher than ppcp removal in unlined nrbs 4 conclusion this study provides the first comprehensive analysis of the occurrence and removal of ppcps in innovative alternative owts nrbs the major findings include 23 ppcps were detected in at least one ste sample with concentrations ranging from above 30 000 ng l for caffeine acetaminophen and paraxanthine to below 100 ng l for ketoprofen primidone and lamotrigine nrbs are capable of removing ppcps as well as or better than conventional wwtps presumably due to extended hrt and or the presence of alternative mechanisms e g fungal degradation abiotic processes not available in conventional systems and the oxic nitrifying layer of nrbs achieved 50 99 of the measured removal for 19 of the 23 ppcps detected in both ste and eff samples the results of this study have multiple implications for improvement of ppcp removal in wastewater treatment systems firstly the data indicate that nrbs a low cost owts option are effective at reducing the levels of a variety of ppcps and can therefore be useful for improving the quality of ground water in unsewered areas more generally these findings provide evidence of the dominant mechanisms involved in the removal of ppcps and can thus inform future experiments for further clarification of the removal processes understanding the importance of these mechanisms is crucial for designing systems to optimize ppcp

16571,the presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps in the environment is primarily the result of discharge of waste including from onsite wastewater treatment systems owtss which are employed by 25 of homes in the united states however the occurrence and removal of ppcps in owtss is not well understood particularly given the large diversity in ppcp compounds as well as in owts designs in this study we monitored 26 different ppcps in 13 full scale nitrogen removing biofilters nrbs an innovative alternative type of owts that utilizes an overlying sand layer and an underlying woodchip sand layer to simultaneously remove nitrogen and other wastewater derived contaminants the specific objectives of this study were i to measure the occurrence of ppcps in septic tank effluent ste that served as an influent to nrbs ii to quantify ppcp removal in three types of nrb configurations n 13 and iii to evaluate ppcp removal with depth and environmental conditions in nrbs aqueous samples were taken during 42 separate sampling events during 2016 2019 and analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis of the ste samples yielded detection of 23 of the 26 ppcps with caffeine being the most abundant and frequently detected compound at 52 000 ng l range 190 181 000 ng l followed by acetaminophen and paraxanthine at 47 500 ng l 190 160 000 ng l and 34 300 ng l 430 210 000 ng l respectively cimetidine fenofibrate and warfarin were the only compounds not detected the average removal of ppcps by nrbs ranged from 58 to 99 for the various compounds ppcp removal as a function of depth in the systems showed that 50 to 99 of the observed removal was achieved within the top oxic layer 0 46 cm of the nrbs for 19 analytes seven of the compounds had 85 removal by the same depth these results indicate that nrbs are effective at removing ppcps and that a large portion of the removal is achieved within the oxic nitrifying layer of the nrbs overall the removal of ppcps in nrbs was comparable n 8 or better n 15 than that observed for conventional wastewater treatment plants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pharmaceuticals and

quality while removal by wwtps has been the focus of many ppcp studies benotti and brownawell 2007 zhang et al 2014 sui et al 2010 ryu et al 2014 jelic et al 2010 miege et al 2009 25 of houses in the u s are still served by septic systems nowra 2018 and in some regions the percentage of unsewered houses is as high as 75 kelly mcgovern 2019 this underscores the importance of improving our understanding of ppcp removal by owtss a variety of ppcps are commonly detected in septic tank effluent ste at ng l and even Âµg l levels godfrey 2004 du et al 2014 matamoros et al 2009 del rosario et al 2014 indicating that in general removal of these contaminants by septic tanks alone is poor a study by du et al 2014 made direct comparisons of removal of 14 ppcps by septic tanks a conventional wwtp and a wetland system coupled to a septic tank in every case the wwtp and the wetland system had better removals than the septic tank studies by conn et al 2010 and wilcox et al 2009 reported high removals of caffeine acetaminophen and paraxanthine compounds known to degrade well under oxic conditions jim et al 2006 xue et al 2010 blair et al 2015 in leach fields a variety of alternative owtss including sand beds and constructed wetlands have been studied as upgrades from and additions to simple septic systems ppcp removal in such alternative systems is typically similar to removal measured in conventional wwtps du et al 2014 heufelder 2014 li et al 2014 llorens et al 2009 matamoros et al 2009 schaider et al 2017 however there is a huge variety of owts types and comparison of ppcp removal in owtss with various designs can help to establish essential characteristics of systems that effectively remove ppcps a survey of the literature on ppcp removal by various owts indicates that the most successful systems often have designs that prioritize a few key features that are in alignment with understood mechanisms of removal for a variety of ppcps three of the most studied removal mechanisms are i aerobic biodegradation ii anaerobic or suboxic biodegradation and iii sorption blair et al 2015 monsalvo et al 2014 alvarino et al 2014 additional mechanisms including fugal degradation vasiliadou et al 2016 rodrÃ­guez rodrÃ­guez et al 2012 cruz morato et al 2013 and abiotic chemical reactions wirth et al 1998 hardie et al 2009 bosetto et al 2006 have also been studied in the past but further research is needed to explore their potential for ppcp removal in owtss sorption is reversible and once breakthrough occurs further loss may be attributed to degradation processes many compounds including acetaminophen and caffeine are known to be efficiently removed under oxic conditions jim et al 2006 xue et al 2010 blair et al 2015 while others like the antibiotics trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole have been shown to be readily degraded by anaerobic and denitrifying communities xue et al 2010 lakshminarasimman et al 2018 although some ppcps are successfully biodegraded under either condition most have significantly more effective degradation by one or the other lakshminarasimman et al 2018 alvarino et al 2014 and thus the redox conditions within owtss may heavily impact ppcp removal additionally since the mechanism and efficiency of ppcp removal varies considerably between compounds owts with higher diversity of conditions and therefore microbial communities tend to be more successful at overall ppcp removal hijosa valsero et al 2010 nitrogen removing biofilters nrbs are innovative owtss designed to target nitrogen removal via sequential nitrification denitrification gobler et al 2021 the resulting diversity of redox conditions within the system gives it the potential to effectively remove a variety of organic contaminants even recalcitrant ones like 1 4 dioxane lee et al 2021 nrbs are in ground vertical flow systems consisting of a ste dispersion mat spread over a 46 centimeter unsaturated and therefore primarily oxic sand layer which in turn overlays a 46 centimeter sand and woodchip layer where suboxic conditions are maintained through saturation fig 1 a recent study examined nitrogen removal by nrbs finding that all sampled systems n 10 removed total nitrogen tn by 80 to effluent values 10 mg n l gobler et al 2021 this work aims to explore the occurrence and the removal of 26 ppcps table s1 in 13 full scale nrbs installed in the field specifically by i measuring ppcp occurrence and concentration in thirteen stes ii quantifying ppcp removal in these nrbs and iii examining the depth profile of ppcp removal in nrbs and considering its implications regarding mechanisms possibly contributing to ppcp removal we hypothesize that nrbs will perform as well as or even better than conventional wwtps to remove ppcps because the availability of both oxic and suboxic conditions within one system and long retention times are expected to promote biodegradation of a wide range of ppcps by supporting diverse microbial communities furthermore biofilm build up may allow additional sorption in the system as a temporary sink for ppcps the results of this study will contribute to the limited literature on ppcp occurrence and removal in owtss by providing data from a novel system featuring both oxic and suboxic zones and long hydraulic retention times hrts 2 methods 2 1 chemicals and materials lc ms grade

dispersal system two separate layers of filtering material and lysimeters or linings for sample collection the three variations on this design are illustrated in fig 1 and described below in nine of the systems ste is dispersed across the top of the nrb by a geomat matrix installed approximately 15 cm below the ground surface in the remaining four systems l3 l4 l6 and l7 the dispersal system consists of piping and gravel from there the wastewater trickles through the upper unsaturated nitrifying layer which consists of 46 cm of c33 sand nitrified effluent from the first layer is then filtered through a second 46 cm denitrifying layer consisting of a 50 50 mixture of c33 sand and woodchips within the nrb samples were collected in lysimeters installed at 15 cm below the geomat at the bottom of the 46 cm sand layer and at the bottom of the denitrifying layer the three variations on the nrb system studied here differ in the design of their second denitrifying layer fig 1 and will be referred to as unlined lined and woodchip box systems unlined nrbs have the simplest design with two vertically stacked 46 cm layers and three lysimeters for sample collection fig 1a unlined systems rely on reduced hydraulic flow due to high material density to achieve a saturated denitrification layer and therefore may not be completely anoxic however a study by gobler et al 2021 showed unlined nrbs to be as effective at denitrification as lined or woodchip box systems lined systems are identical to unlined nrbs but with the addition of a plastic liner installed around the entire denitrifying layer fig 1b saturated and therefore suboxic conditions were maintained in the lined denitrifying layer via a pvc standpipe with an opening level to the top of the denitrifying layer in lined nrbs lysimeters were placed at the 15 cm and 46 cm depths for sample collection while the liner collects and feeds the system effluent to the pvc pipe for sampling finally woodchip box systems have a spatially separated denitrifying zone fig 1c a liner around the nitrifying layer collects the nitrified effluent which is carried by gravity to the bottom of a 3785 l tank of woodchips the wastewater then flows upward through the woodchips to the effluent sampling pipe this up flow design keeps the woodchip box saturated and therefore suboxic 2 3 sample sites nrbs were installed in massachusetts at the massachusetts alternative septic system test center masstc and in suffolk county ny at single home county properties the masstc facility diverts sewage from upstream of a sewage treatment plant thereby feeding the nrbs with wastewater from a small sewershed including a county jail and a military base the nrbs installed in ny are each fed by sewage from a single home in all cases wastewater was pumped first to a septic tank with a holding time of 2 3 days before application to the surface of the nrb a total of 13 separate nrbs were sampled for this study including five lined systems two at masstc three in ny six unlined systems three at masstc and three in ny and two woodchip box systems one each at masstc and ny 2 4 sampling methods a total of 42 sampling events were conducted the number of sampling timepoints at each nrb are given in table s2 all samples were taken quarterly and dates are given in table s3 ste lysimeter lys and effluent eff samples were taken on the same day for each sampling event 100 ml ste samples were taken as a grab sample from the septic tank for each system hrt in the septic tanks was 2 3 days at all sites lys and eff waters were collected passively over the course of 2 days prior to sampling and 500 ml samples were taken the hrt in the nrbs is estimated at 4 5 days gobler et al 2021 which makes this sampling scheme non ideal for the direct comparison of ppcps in the ste and eff samples because ppcp concentrations in ste have large temporal variability directly comparable ste and eff samples would require measurement of the same parcel of wastewater first when it is in the septic tank and then 4 5 days later when it reaches the nrb eff the sampling method used in this study was designed to coordinate ppcp sampling along with closer to steady state wastewater components including nitrogen and bod gobler et al 2021 ideally ste and eff samples would have been taken on separate days in order to account for the hrt of the systems without extending the composite time of the eff samples methods for estimating removals given this complication are discussed and compared in the results and discussion section below samples were collected in amber glass bottles 250 ml for ste 1 l for lys and eff bottles were cleaned prior to sampling by soaking overnight in a trisodium phosphate bath followed by an overnight acid soak in 1 hcl a methanol rinse and drying in an oven at 100 c samples were stored on ice during transport to the laboratory where they were immediately filtered using glass microfiber filters 47 mm whatman spiked with isotopes and stored at 4 c until spe loading was completed within 24 hrs 2 5 sample extraction cleanup and analysis approximately 100 ml of ste samples and 500 ml of lys and eff samples were filtered using 47 mm glass fiber filters whatman immediately after filtering samples were spiked with the isotope standards and weighed within 24 hrs all samples were loaded onto oasis hlb spe cartridges 6cc 500 mg waters which had been preconditioned with 6 ml methanol followed by 6 ml milliq water cartridges were dried and then stored at 18 c until analysis samples were eluted under gravity with 6 ml methanol and 6 ml methanol with 0 1 trifluoroacetic acid and then evaporated under nitrogen gas ultrapure airgas pa usa to a volume of 100 Âµl samples were then brought up to a total of 1 ml in a mixture of 90 10 water methanol with vortexing centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm weighed and transferred to autosampler vials for analysis using pasture pipettes according to the analysis methods outlined below a portion of the samples were analyzed on a instrument with heightened sensitivity those samples were not concentrated after elution in order to prevent saturation of the detector instead a 90 Âµl aliquot of these samples was brought up to a total of 1 ml in a mixture of 90 10 water methanol in an autosampler vial two separate instruments were used in the analysis for this study due to availability samples analyzed in 2018 used an agilent high performance liquid chromatography system coupled with an agilent 6224a time of flight mass spectrometer lc tof ms in the chemistry department of state university of new york stony brook sbu a comparison of instrument performances is further discussed in the supplemental information samples analyzed in 2020 used an agilent hplc coupled with an agilent 6495b triple quadrupole mass spectrometer lc ms ms provided by the new york state center for clean water technology ccwt at sbu all samples were separated using a waters cortecs c18 column 2 1 150 mm 2 7 Âµm pore size with a guard column of the same material the method was slightly adjusted from a previously published method by mullen 2018 solvents used were a 0 1 formic acid in milliq water and b a 50 50 methanol acetonitrile mixture 10 Âµl injection volumes were used for all samples on both instruments the gradient started at 98 solvent a and 2 solvent b and linearly changed to 100 solvent b over a 25 minute period the ratio was maintained for 3 min before returning to the initial conditions over a 3 minute period a flow rate of 0 4 ml min was used for all samples six minutes between runs were allowed for post run re equilibration retention times and ionization information for all compounds are provided in table s4 all data were quantified using the agilent masshunter quantitative analysis software 2 6 quality control surrogate standards were added to each sample prior to spe loading and used to monitor and correct for the method recovery average isotope recoveries in ste samples were between 55 105 for all compounds except sulfamethoxazole 37 and warfarin 44 table s1 the recoveries for sulfamethoxazole and warfarin were comparable to other studies for wastewater sample analysis katz et al 2010 godfrey et al 2007 and were therefore used to correct concentrations nicotine was also monitored during this study but due to isotope recoveries 400 those results are not reported isotope recoveries in eff and lys samples were between 60 120 for all compounds except sulfamethoxazole 53 which was treated in the same way as the ste samples additionally the ratio of the quantifier ion to the qualifier ion of each compound both native and isotope in the samples was compared to the ratio of the quantifier ion to the qualifier ion of the same compound in the calibration standards the results are listed in table s5 in all cases the average percent difference was 20 frequent field lab and solvent blanks were analyzed and all detections were consistently less than one third of the detection limit for each compound a delay column was used to minimize deet and tcep background detection limits dl were calculated from the lowest detected sample by scaling the response to a signal to noise ratio of 3 1 detection limits in ste samples are approximately five times higher than those in lys and eff samples because of their relative concentration factors 2 7 ppcp removal calculations in this manuscript data are reported for all compounds in order to contribute to the literature even for infrequently detected ppcps but reported removals are categorized based on detection frequency and ste concentration of the analyte to help define the level of confidence in their approximation of the reality of ppcp attenuation in nrbs with these conditions removals reported in this manuscript are calculated without the inclusion of dl data and therefore represent a lower limit on the real removal achieved by nrbs the removal for a given ppcp at one nrb site referred to as combined removal was calculated according to the equation r s i t e 1 s t e s i t e 1 e f f s i t e 1 s t e s i t e 1 100 where rsite 1 is the removal at one nrb site across all sampling dates stesite 1 is the median ste ppcp concentration across all sampling dates at the nrb site and effsite1 is the median eff ppcp concentration across all sampling dates at the nrb site future work using controlled influent on lab scale systems based on the nrb design will help verify these results by providing a comparison to data that is not limited by detection frequencies or influent concentrations 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of ppcps in ste the detection frequency of ppcps in stes measured in this study table 1 varied by compound especially at single home nrbs with many non prescription ppcps having 90 detection and twelve of the less frequently prescribed drugs having 20 detection across all samples table 1 for example caffeine and deet were the only compounds found in every ste sample taken and cimetidine fenofibrate and warfarin had no detections in any ste samples ppcp concentrations varied as well but generally the ste concentrations determined in this study table 1 were in agreement with ranges found in the literature for ste concentrations conn et al 2010 matamoros et al 2009 schaider et al 2017 the highest overall average ste concentrations were found for non prescription ppcps including acetaminophen 47 000 44 000 ng l caffeine 52 000 48 000 ng l paraxanthine 34 000 45 000 ng l deet 29 000 50 000 ng l cotinine 8400 19 900 ng l and ranitidine 9600 8200 ng l additional compounds with average ste concentrations over 1000 ng l include diphenhydramine 5500 15 000 ng l diltiazem 1300 2600 ng l diclofenac 5400 4700 ng l and the prescription drugs sulfamethoxazole 2900 2900 ng l and propranolol 1000 600 ng l the remaining detected analytes averaged 100 1000 ng l in the ste while tcep salbutamol and primidone averaged 100 ng l ranitidine which had higher ste concentrations in this work than have been reported in the literature schaider et al 2017 gao et al 2019 was only detected in the ste at one single home nrb site it was detected at high levels 7200 140 000 ng l in all three samples taken at that site variability in ste concentrations across all nrb sites is discussed further below 3 2 ppcp removal in nrbs the discussion below includes comparison of nrb performance to wwtps in general and also particularly to trickling filter tf systems tfs are considered here as directly comparable to nrbs because both systems rely on fixed microbial communities as opposed to the suspended communities in batch reactor systems and biofilm buildup which can support diverse microenvironments fig 2 shows combined removals for each of the 23 analytes detected in both ste and eff samples in all studied nrbs with three subplots separating the ppcps by the confidence of the results based on their frequency of occurrence and concentration levels the plots are overlaid with comparison data from the literature on ppcp removals in tf systems table s6 highest confidence is attributed to results for frequently occurring compounds that were detected at 38 or more of the 13 nrb sites and had average ste concentrations higher than 600 ng l n 9 results for compounds that were detected at 31 38 of the sites or had ste concentrations lower than 400 ng l n 6 are considered to have intermediate confidence lower confidence is attributed to results for compounds detected at less than 31 of the nrb sites or with average ste concentrations below 200 ng l n 8 fig 2a contains the eight compounds with highest confidence caffeine paraxanthine and acetaminophen are consistently very well removed by the nrbs with average removals of 99 98 and 96 respectively across all systems these agree well with removals reported in conventional wwtps for caffeine and acetaminophen zhang et al 2014 benotti and brownawell 2007 and as can be seen in fig 2a they are higher than removal found in tf systems in almost all cases ejhed et al 2018 camacho muÃ±oz et al 2012 mai et al 2016 petrie et al 2017 bartelt hunt et al 2009 lee and rasmussen 2006 trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole cotinine diphenhydramine and deet all average 80 removal in the nrbs which is similar to removals reported at conventional wwtps for cotinine heufelder 2014 benotti and brownawell 2007 and considerably higher than removals reported for the remaining compounds e g deet and sulfamethoxazole are reportedly removed between 60 70 sui et al 2010 ryu et al 2014 heufelder 2014 hijosa valsero et al 2011 and trimethoprim and diphenhydramine are often removed 30 jelic et al 2010 miege et al 2009 ryu et al 2014 removals determined in this study are also similar to and often better than those found in studies of tf systems burns et al 2018 brandt et al 2013 faleye et al 2019 camacho muÃ±oz et al 2012 mai et al 2016 johnson et al 2017 bartelt hunt et al 2009 lee and rasmussen 2006 fig 2b contains results for the six compounds with intermediate confidence the average removal in nrbs for these compounds ranged from 94 for atenolol to 62 for salbutamol however even with the increase in the removal range from plot a these compounds still have generally equal or better removal in the nrb systems compared to tf systems burns et al 2018 ejhed et al 2018 falas et al 2012 petrie et al 2017 lee and rasmussen 2006 of these atenolol ketoprofen and salbutamol have a range 30 90 of removals reported in the literature for conventional wwtps zhang et al 2014 jelic et al 2010 benotti and brownawell 2007 miege et al 2009 while metoprolol tcep and diltiazem are typically poorly 0 30 removed jelic et al 2010 benotti and brownawell 2007 miege et al 2009 ryu et al 2014 finally in fig 2c are data for 8 ppcps with lower confidence in calculating their removal due to infrequent detection again the removal by nrb was in all cases in the same range or higher than removals found for tf systems burns et al 2018 ejhed et al 2018 falas et al 2012 comber et al 2019 lajeunesse et al 2012 removal by conventional wwtp was between 60 70 for primidone and ciprofloxacin he et al 2015 ryu et al 2014 which is slightly higher than the 59 and 48 average removals reported here propranolol and diclofenac have removals ranging from 10 to 90 in conventional wwtps gabet giraud et al 2010 zhang et al 2014 carbamazepine and fluoxetine are reported to be recalcitrant 30 removal in wwtps zhang et al 2014 jelic et al 2010 benotti and brownawell 2007 fluoxetine was measured at two nrb sites with removals of 64 and 68 carbamazepine was detected at a total of six sites and had removals between 75 94 at three sites 2 removal at one site and negative removals at the remaining two sites the negative removals are not included in the figure and carbamazepine is included in fig 2c primarily because the range of measured removals is not well represented by a box and whisker plot negative removals for carbamazepine are commonly reported in the literature and may be attributed to deconjugation of metabolites to the parent compound blair et al 2015 verlicchi et al 2012 or in the case of this study to the combination of low ste concentrations and temporal ste variability that was not accounted for in the sampling plan many ppcps have low sorption coefficients and are widely reported to have minimal loss to sorption during municipal wastewater treatment log koc and log kow values are included in table s1 jelic et al 2010 monsalvo et al 2014 yan et al 2014 maszkowska et al 2014 and to be transported hundreds of meters in groundwater benotti and brownawell 2009 however some compounds have been reported to have high kd values such as fluoxetine kd 1200 l kg 1 diltiazem kd 585 l kg 1 and ranitidine kd 350 430 l kg 1 blair et al 2015 benotti and brownawell 2009 these compounds are expected to have higher loss to the solid phase during wastewater treatment and have been reported to have limited transport in groundwater plumes benotti and brownawell 2009 sorption of ppcps in nrbs is likely a combination of adsorption to sites on the surface of material components i e sand woodchips distribution system material and lining material as well as sorption to biofilms formed on these materials therefore while ppcp removal via this mechanism is largely dependent on the sorption coefficient of the compound material surface area and charge and the presence of biofilms torresi et al 2017 are environmental factors that can influence sorption sorption is expected to play a role in the temporary removal of ppcps from onsite wastewater and future research with controlled column experiments may further reveal the role of adsorption in the overall removal of these contaminants the comparable or greater removal of ppcps from the ste to the eff in nrbs as contrasted with conventional wwtps may be due in part to the hrt of these owtss which at 4 5 days is considerably longer than the 1 day used in most municipal wwtps the extended hrt is hypothesized to help compensate the slow biodegradation rate for many ppcps in nrbs thus enhancing their removal compared to conventional wwtps we also speculate the long hrts may allow promotion of less selectivity and therefore more diversity within the microbial community in addition to extended hrt mineralogical components of the sand particularly iron and manganese oxides may catalyze chemical reaction pathways important to the removal of ppcps that are amines or carbonyls de carvalho et al 2006 wirth et al 1998 hardie et al 2009 bosetto et al 2006 potentially relevant abiotic reactions have been studied previously and further research is needed to clarify the role they may play in the observed removal of ppcps in nrbs finally it is possible that the microbial diversity even within only the upper layer of an nrb system as reported by langlois 2020 improves the overall performance with respect to ppcp removal wwtps are designed to optimize the removal of specifically targeted wastewater components bod pathogens nutrients etc which can limit ppcp removal to compounds degradable under the defined conditions the more natural nrb systems target conditions for nitrogen removal but may simultaneously allow for the formation of microenvironments with diverse conditions either within biofilms or along differential flow paths gobler et al 2021 this means that compounds resistant to one degradation mechanism still have potential to be removed these hypotheses are further explored below using depth profiles of ppcp removal in nrbs 3 3 confidence in calculated removals and confounding factors temporal variability of ste ppcp concentrations is a challenge posed by data from single home owtss in this study and in the literature the far from steady state ste concentration of most ppcps is primarily due to the limited sewage source at such sites which has two main effects on the data first the occurrence of ppcps in single home systems is limited by the small number of occupants available to potentially use each ppcp which can drastically affect the detection frequency second single home systems lack the high levels of dilution seen at wwtps with expansive sewersheds which can increase the maximum detected ppcp concentrations entering an owts therefore depending on the compound ste concentration at a single site can vary from below the detection limit to high levels Âµg l from one sampling event to the next these effects are illustrated by the data from this study in fig 3 for select compounds and in the ranges of the ste concentrations provided in table 1 for all detected ppcps as the distributions in fig 3 indicate in this study it was found that much of the variability in ste concentration could be accounted for by separating samples by nrb site often dropping the rsd from 100 to below 70 it is valuable to explore the effects of ste concentration and detection frequency on the calculated removals in this study in order to assess the validity of the results and consider best practices for analyzing similar data to accomplish this removals were calculated both as a direct comparison of ste and eff samples taken during a single sampling event referred to as individual removal and also as a comparison of the median ste and eff concentration across all sampling events at a single nrb site combined removal used throughout this study in both cases the removals were calculated with and without the inclusion of eff data points with ppcp concentrations below the detection limit when those points were included they were included as the detection limit value for the compound the resulting removals are provided in table 1 for all detected ppcps ordered by detection frequency the results show that for compounds like caffeine and deet which have high detection frequencies 100 for both and high ste concentrations 52 000 48 000 ng l and 29 000 50 000 ng l respectively the calculated removal is largely unaffected by the method of calculation varying between 99 99 8 between the four values for caffeine and between 84 87 for deet however as detection frequency and ste concentration drop it becomes more likely that the various calculations yield differing values as is seen for salbutamol df 31 ste concentration 180 230 ng l with removal values between 59 80 for the four calculation methods and ketoprofen df 18 ste concentration 83 32 ng l which ranges between 61 91 removal the magnitude of the ste concentration was found to affect the calculated removal to some extent since particularly low ste concentrations 100 ng l paired with eff detection limits around 10 ng l average for all ppcps 18 ng l range 3 192 ng l limited the extent of measurable ppcp loss therefore overall this data set suggests that higher confidence in a calculated removal may be merited when detection frequency and ste concentrations are high based on this result it is recommended that studies of ppcp removal by owtss may benefit from composite sampling over the hrt of the system or repeated sampling over a large time period for a comparison of median ste and eff values as was used in this study 3 4 ppcp removal as a function of depth in nrbs ppcp attenuation with depth in the nrbs was investigated as a first step in exploring potential mechanisms of removal to relate remediation of individual ppcps to the different environmental conditions of the nrb layers this study does not provide conclusive evidence of the contributions of any particular mechanisms but the hypotheses formed from this data may inform future experiments for further exploration of the roles of sorption biodegradation and chemical reaction in ppcp removal by nrbs analytes were grouped by the extent of their removal in the nitrifying oxic layer and then by their additional removal in the denitrifying suboxic layer concentrations with depth of representative compounds are shown in fig 4 and are provided for all analytes in table s7 previously 10 of the 13 nrbs surveyed here were monitored for total nitrogen tn removal and were reported to reduce tn by an average of 83 94 over the multi year sampling period gobler et al 2021 the average eff tn concentrations were below 9 mg n l in all cases confirming that the studied nrbs provided ideal conditions for both nitrification oxic top layer and denitrification suboxic bottom layer processes this provides opportunities for the removal of ppcps under both aerobic and suboxic conditions in the systems this does not exclude the potential for ppcp removal by alternative mechanisms which is recommended for future study the first group is composed of five compounds that showed near complete removal within the top nitrifying layer suggesting aerobic biodegradation may be an important mechanism represented by acetaminophen 93 removed by the 46 cm lysimeter and cotinine 92 in fig 4a and b respectively this group also contains caffeine 98 deet 86 and venlafaxine 98 although venlafaxine had only 3 detection frequency across the 39 ste samples aerobic biodegradation of each of these ppcps has been reported in the literature with complete and rapid loss for acetaminophen caffeine and deet in a variety of experimental designs jim et al 2006 gimeno et al 2016 brown and wong 2018 lakshminarasimman et al 2018 and reduction of cotinine bradley et al 2007 in oxic stream sediments and wwtp systems studies in the literature suggest sorption and biosorption will not significantly affect these compounds jim et al 2006 monsalvo et al 2014 musson et al 2010 and these processes would likely provide only a temporary sink and so consistent removal in samples taken multiple years after system installation could suggest aerobic biodegradation as the primary mechanism of removal excluding venlafaxine all ppcps in this group had 58 detections and ste concentrations 1000 ng l with the exception of deet which dropped in median concentration from 6000 ng l 740 99 000 ng l to 1200 ng l 19 8000 ng l all of these compounds had concentrations below 200 ng l by the 46 cm lysimeter for ppcps in this group further removal in the denitrifying layers was not observed either due to a lack of additional attenuation deet or to analytical difficulty in distinguishing between concentrations nearing the detection limit acetaminophen caffeine cotinine and venlafaxine five of the studied compounds had 52 84 removal in the nitrifying layer and showed little to no additional removal in the denitrification layer therefore having overall intermediate removals in the nrbs fig 4c shows this pattern for tcep and similar results were obtained for salbutamol ciprofloxacin diclofenac and primidone with total final removals of 61 62 48 84 and 59 respectively concentrations with depth given in table s7 of this group tcep and salbutamol were the only compounds with detection frequencies above 20 and both of them had median ste concentrations 100 ng l further study of these compounds in a lab scale setting with controlled influent would be beneficial for improving our understanding of their removal however the removals reported in this study are similar to those reported in the literature for these compounds in oxic systems dorival garcia et al 2013 xue et al 2010 alvarino et al 2014 jim et al 2006 there are references which suggest diclofenac and ciprofloxacin could be partially removed by anaerobic communities xue et al 2010 dorival garcia et al 2013 implying the lack of additional removal by the suboxic denitrifying layer in this work could be due to typically slower degradation rates by anaerobic processes coupled with relatively short hrt in the nrb compared to the studies in which anaerobic degradation was demonstrated or again due to an analytical inability to differentiate between the low concentrations found in the 46 cm lys and 92 cm eff samples for these compounds that had already low starting concentrations in the ste samples the third compound group is composed of 12 ppcps which showed substantial removal in the denitrifying layer of the nrbs as demonstrated in fig 4d e and f for representative compounds trimethoprim atenolol and metoprolol and for the remaining compounds in table s7 two compounds in this group carbamazepine and fluoxetine had 70 total removal in the nrbs and in both cases all removal was found to occur within the denitrifying layers in fact the average removal at the 46 cm lysimeter samples was negative for both compounds negative removal of carbamazepine has been found in the literature and is generally attributed to deconjugation blair et al 2015 verlicchi et al 2012 there could also be discrepancies in the reported values due to the non comprehensive nature of samples collected by lysimeter poor removal of carbamazepine and fluoxetine in anoxic environments has been reported in the literature alvarino et al 2014 monsalvo et al 2014 carbamazepine is generally reported to be highly recalcitrant under both oxic and anoxic conditions lakshminarasimman et al 2018 xue et al 2010 findings for fluoxetine are variable a study by alvarino et al 2014 found better removal of fluoxetine in an oxic conventional activated sludge cas system 80 with partial removal in an upflow suboxic sludge blanket 10 however a study by benotti and brownawell 2007 found only 7 5 removal of fluoxetine in a wwtp employing cas thus the fluoxetine removal measured in nrbs is consistent with the literature and further study yielding additional data points may help clarify the capability of nrbs in removing this compound the remaining 10 compounds in this third group each had 47 average removal by the bottom of the nitrifying sand layer except a 29 removal for ketoprofen and no lys samples with lamotrigine detections and had an additional 9 82 removal occur between the 46 cm lysimeter sample and the final effluent fig 4d e and f shows this removal pattern for trimethoprim atenolol and metoprolol respectively table s7 additional ppcps with similar results include diltiazem diphenhydramine ketoprofen lamotrigine paraxanthine propranolol and sulfamethoxazole in the case of paraxanthine this pattern is driven by data from the unlined nrbs which given their potentially only partially saturated denitrifying layers are the most likely to support some amount of aerobic biodegradation in the primarily suboxic environment thus the mechanism of additional removal for paraxanthine is not definitive based on previous studies in the literature paraxanthine is readily degradable in oxic bioreactors and is likely to degrade though more slowly in suboxic systems as well similarly to its parent compound caffeine bradley et al 2007 the 10 compounds grouped here are described in the literature as moderately biodegradable under both oxic and anoxic conditions monsalvo et al 2014 alvarino et al 2014 suarez et al 2010 blair et al 2015 wu et al 2010 brown and wong 2018 tang et al 2020 which supports the results of this study where partial removal in the nitrification layer was found followed by additional removal in the suboxic denitrifying zones of the 42 sampling events included in this study only six yielded enough volume in the 6 in lysimeter for ppcp analysis therefore while data from this depth is included in fig 4 more data points are required for the interpretation of the removal within the top 6 in of the nrbs however it is worthy to note that when available removal by the 6 in lysimeter correlated well with removal by the 46 cm lysimeter this suggests that removal activity in the nitrification layer occurs primarily within the upper 15 cm of the sand this result is supported by a study by langlois 2020 which showed that most of the microbial biomass in the nitrifying layer of nrbs is located in the top 3 cm of the sand it could also be explained by sorption to the dispersal system materials or the nrb sand collectively these results indicate that a significant portion of removal for many of the analytes is occurring in the upper 46 cm of the sand layer for 19 of the detected ppcps more than 50 of the total observed removal occurred within the nitrifying layer and for 10 of those it was 90 while aerobic biodegradation is a likely contributor in most of these cases and the removal by sorption and chemical reaction is not defined by this study it is also hypothesized that anaerobic suboxic denitrifying organisms residing within microenvironments protected by biofilms may be present in the primarily oxic nitrifying layer and could play a role in ppcp removal this hypothesis is supported by a study by gobler et al 2021 that found partial reduction in tn by the bottom of the nitrifying layer in nrbs the nitrogen removal suggested the occurrence of denitrification in the nitrifying layer and is consistent with the theory of suboxic microenvironments gobler et al 2021 although alternative pathways e g nitrate reduction coupled to iron oxidation nrfo or iron reduction coupled to ammonium reduction to n2 are also possible future work based on these results could further clarify the role of these mechanisms and thereby inform owts designs for optimization of ppcp removal 3 5 ppcp removal by nrb type the extent of ppcp removal achieved by woodchip box unlined and lined nrbs was compared to assess any benefits of the three different denitrification layer designs the comparison is not statistical due to the limited amount of data currently available for the three nrb types fig 5 shows combined removals grouped by nrb type for caffeine cotinine metoprolol and diphenhydramine these four compounds were chosen for comparison because they have detected concentrations for at least four lined and at least four unlined systems and together they demonstrate the variability of the reported removals concentrations provided in table s7 overall the data set shows little indication of a substantial difference in the ppcp removal achieved by woodchip box lined and unlined nrbs gobler et al 2021 found successful tn removal in all nrb installations included in this work and found nrb type to have little effect on the total removal with 83 87 and 84 removed in lined woodchip box and unlined nrbs respectively removal of 1 4 dioxane in six of the same nrbs was reported to be higher in unlined nrbs than in lined or woodchip box systems lee et al 2021 the difference was attributed to additional aerobic biodegradation of 1 4 dioxane in unlined nrbs due to a lack of saturation in the denitrifying layer since most of the ppcps were removed to a large extent within the nitrifying layer it is reasonable that the differences in the denitrifying layer as the defining factor between nrb types did not drastically change the overall ppcp removal caffeine cotinine and metoprolol do appear to have more variance in unlined versus lined nrbs fig 5 this may be due to some variability in the conditions of the system because of the lack of lining separating the nrb layers from the surrounding ground it could also be the result of non uniform sampling due to the use of lysimeters for final effluent collection in unlined systems as opposed to the lined system which combines the final effluent from the entire area of lined nrbs prior to sampling further sampling is needed before a conclusion can be drawn on the relative extent of ppcp removal in different types of nrbs but these current data suggest ppcp removal in lined nrbs is more consistent and possibly higher than ppcp removal in unlined nrbs 4 conclusion this study provides the first comprehensive analysis of the occurrence and removal of ppcps in innovative alternative owts nrbs the major findings include 23 ppcps were detected in at least one ste sample with concentrations ranging from above 30 000 ng l for caffeine acetaminophen and paraxanthine to below 100 ng l for ketoprofen primidone and lamotrigine nrbs are capable of removing ppcps as well as or better than conventional wwtps presumably due to extended hrt and or the presence of alternative mechanisms e g fungal degradation abiotic processes not available in conventional systems and the oxic nitrifying layer of nrbs achieved 50 99 of the measured removal for 19 of the 23 ppcps detected in both ste and eff samples the results of this study have multiple implications for improvement of ppcp removal in wastewater treatment systems firstly the data indicate that nrbs a low cost owts option are effective at reducing the levels of a variety of ppcps and can therefore be useful for improving the quality of ground water in unsewered areas more generally these findings provide evidence of the dominant mechanisms involved in the removal of ppcps and can thus inform future experiments for further clarification of the removal processes understanding the importance of these mechanisms is crucial for designing systems to optimize ppcp

16572,the growing use of silver nanoparticles agnps in personal care products and clothing has increased their concentrations in wastewater and subsequently in sludge raising concerns about their fate and toxicity during wastewater treatment and after land application of sludge this research investigated the fate and removal of agnps during chemical conditioning of anaerobically digested sludge and their impact on soil bacteria and health after land application ferric chloride fecl3 alum al2 so4 3 14 18 h2o and synthetic polyacrylamide polymer were used for sludge conditioning all conditioners effectively removed agnps from the liquid phase and concentrated them in sludge solids concentration analyses showed that out of 53 0 mg l of silver in the sludge only 0 1 to 0 003 mg l of silver remained in the sludge supernatant after conditioning and 12 to 20 of this value were particulates morphological analyses also showed that agnps went through physical chemical and morphological changes in sludge that were not observed in nanopure water and the resulting floc structures and the incorporation of nanoparticles were different for each conditioner the impact of conditioned agnps on the biological activities of soil was evaluated by investigating its impact on the presence of five important phyla acidobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes and proteobacteria the results showed that agnps at a concentration of 20 mg agnps g soil had a minimal impact on the presence and diversity of the assessed phyla also using different chemicals for sludge conditioning resulted in different growth behavior of studied phyla this study provides new insight into how the presence of agnps and different chemicals used for sludge conditioning might impact the soil biological activities and hence plant growth the study also provides a solid basis for further research in the risk assessment of nanoparticle toxicity in biosolids amended soils graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords silver nanoparticles sludge conditioning polymer inorganic conditioner land application 1 introduction silver nanoparticles agnps have received attention in recent years due to their wide use as antimicrobial agents in commercial products and consequently their higher concentrations in the environment compared to other nanoparticles several studies demonstrated the toxicity of agnps on aquatic and terrestrial organisms including plants algae fungi fish earthworms and bacteria shoults wilson et al 2011 colman et al 2013 cunningham et al 2013 masrahi et al 2014 tortella et al 2020 agnps and other nanoparticles used in commercial products e g cosmetics sunscreen shampoo disinfectants textiles laundry products ultimately end up in sewers benn and westerhoff 2008 geranio et al 2009 benn et al 2010 mohan et al 2019 for instance benn et al 2010 showed that different type of tested products a shirt a medical mask and cloth toothpaste shampoo detergent a towel a toy teddy bear and two humidifiers with concentrations of 1 4 to 270 000 Î¼g ag g can release silver in quantities of up to 45 Î¼g ag g product when these products are washed studies have also shown that significant amounts of agnps entering wastewater streams accumulate in treated sludge biosolids kaegi et al 2011 schlich et al 2013 schlich et al 2013 reported that more than 90 of agnps remain attached to wastewater sludge this raises questions about the impact of agnps on biological treatment processes as well as the impact of treatment processes on the fate and transformation of agnps during wastewater and sludge treatment in addition the impact agnps have on the soil ecosystem following the application of biosolids to agricultural lands is not well understood chemical conditioning is required to improve the solid liquid separation before sludge dewatering both inorganic conditioners i e ferric chloride alum lime and organic conditioners i e synthetic polymers are used for chemical conditioning chemical conditioners typically have a high molecular weight and charge they are also added in high concentrations and thus can impact the chemistry morphology fate and behavior of nanoparticles there are major research gaps on the fate and transformation of nanoparticles during treatment processes and studies have so far largely focused on biological treatment processes wang et al 2017 lombi et al 2013 and ma et al 2013 investigated the status of agnps during anaerobic digestion and composting and reported that most of the initial agnps were converted to ag2s and that several factors such as surface coating agnps characteristics and treatment conditions played a role there is relatively little information available on the effect of chemical treatment processes on metallic nanoparticles and no prior study has investigated the effect of organic and inorganic conditioners on the fate and impact of agnps during sludge conditioning beneficial use of biosolids as a fertilizer through land application on agricultural soils is the main form of sludge disposal in many countries due to its low cost land application provides the means to recycle nutrients and organic carbon but may also add unwanted contaminants such as agnps to the soil studies have shown that agnps which are typically used as antibacterial agents could impact soil microbial activities colman et al 2013 schlich et al 2016 samarajeewa et al 2017 abdulsada et al 2021a 2021b this is a concern as soil organisms are responsible for organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling and determine the overall soil health the main objective of this study was to investigate the fate transformation and removal of agnps during chemical conditioning of sludge with ferric chloride alum and polymer the study also aimed to determine the impact of agnps on soil microorganisms and health after sludge application this is the first study to investigate the impact of organic and inorganic conditioners on agnps the study employed environmentally relevant agnp concentrations and used conditioned agnps rather than virgin agnps for simulated land application to provide more realistic representation of what might occur in the field 2 materials and methods 2 1 agnps sludge and soil characteristics pristine silver nanoparticles 99 9 purity were purchased from nanocomposix inc san diego ca usa the physical and chemical properties of the silver nanoparticles are shown in table s1 supplementary material the particle size distribution of agnps was examined and confirmed by transmission electron microscopy tem analysis before use and the agnps stock solution was stored at 4 c anaerobically digested sludge was obtained from the robert o pickard environmental center ropec in ottawa canada the sludge was collected from mesophilic anaerobic digesters and its chemical properties are provided in table s2 loamy topsoil from artistic landscape designs ltd ottawa canada without compost or chemical fertilizer was used to simulate the land application of biosolids loamy soil combines all three types of soil particles sand silt and clay in relatively equal amounts that gives a proper and healthy balance of soil types a loamy topsoil is a loamy soil that was taken from the top 30 cm of the ground soil samples were sieved through a sieve with 2 mm opening air dried and stored at 4 c until use initial soil analyses measured total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn total phosphorus ph and cation exchange capacity cec as presented in table s3 2 2 organic and inorganic conditioners two inorganic conditioners ferric chloride fecl3 and alum al2 so4 3 14 18 h2o and one organic conditioner polyacrylamide polymer were assessed to determine their effect on agnps during sludge conditioning these chemicals were chosen because they are widely used for sludge conditioning and dewatering at wastewater treatment plants their concentrations were selected after preliminary conditioning and dewatering experiments to find the optimal dose for each coagulant table s4 ferric chloride was purchased from fisher scientific canada in powder form and a stock solution was prepared at a concentration of 40 mg ml 4 w v alum was purchased from anachemia canada inc in granular form and a stock solution was prepared at a concentration of 170 mg ml 17 the organic conditioner flopolymer ca 4600 snf canada was a dry cationic polyacrylamide polymer with a high charge density and high molecular weight a stock solution of the polymer was prepared at a concentration of 2 mg ml 0 2 by rapid mixing for an hour with a magnetic bar stirrer slow mixing for another hour and then resting for an hour before use 2 3 experimental design 2 3 1 chemical conditioning the study was performed in two stages the first stage investigated the effect of chemical conditioning on the fate and removal of agnps chemical conditioning was conducted in two different media nanopure water and anaerobically digested sludge nanopure water was used as a reference media to observe the interaction of agnps and chemical conditioners in the absence of other contaminants nanopure and ultrapure water are purified until the last trace of impurities are removed for all contaminant types and they are both atsm type i water with less than 1 cfu ml bacteria they are the names used by different manufacturers of water purification units barnstead and millipore both waters were used in this study there were four reactors for both nanopure water and sludge one was the control which had no conditioners and the other three reactors had different chemical conditioners one reactor for each conditioner table s5 illustrates the contents of each reactor agnps were added to each reactor at a concentration of 0 1 mg ml that corresponds to 5 60 1 05 mg agnps g sludge dry weight for the sludge reactor and vortexed for 30 s after spiking with agnps coagulation and flocculation were performed for each water and sludge reactor using three conditioners the conditioning step was carried out by adding the chemical conditioner rapid mixing for 1 min and slow mixing for 30 min the ph was recorded after the chemical addition and for ferric chloride and alum was adjusted using 1 m naoh sodium hydroxide table s5 also illustrates the concentrations of the conditioning chemicals dosed and the ph values in water and sludge reactors after conditioning water and sludge samples were prepared for morphological and concentration analyses 2 3 2 simulated land application the second stage of this study examined the effect of agnps on the relative population of selected phyla in soil after sludge application five 250 ml clean glass beakers were each filled with 100 g soil and the agnps and conditioner concentrations spiked in these soil reactors are provided in table s 6 there were two controls control 1 received unconditioned anaerobically digested sludge that had no agnps while control 2 received the same sludge but was previously mixed with agnps the other three reactors received sludge that was mixed with the same concentration of agnps and was subjected to chemical conditioning using a different coagulant for each reactor as described in stage one a volume of 62 ml of anaerobically digested sludge with 2 initial solids concentration was added to each soil reactor after the addition of sludge the soil moisture content mc was 60 at the start of the experiment the sludge soil ratio was 0 01 g g dry weight and it was selected based on the biosolids land application guidelines at a rate of 8 ton ha every 5 years ome and omafr 1996 in addition other studies were considered in choosing the sludge application ratio colman et al 2013 whitley et al 2013 johansson et al 1999 the initial agnps concentration in sludge before conditioning was 2 mg agnps g sludge dry weight that corresponded to 20 mg agnps kg soil when sludge was combined with soil the agnps concentration used represents the higher range of the published values of their predicted and recorded concentrations in wastewater sludge ccme 2010 epa 2018 blaser et al 2008 gottschalk et al 2013 the reactors were incubated with day night cycles of 8 16 h at a constant temperature of 22 1 c this study was carried out for 105 days during which chemical and biological analyses were conducted every 15 d to examine changes in soil characteristics and microbial activity over time the analyses were done by withdrawing 2 3 g of soil from each reactor every 15 days throughout the experiments mc was maintained at 45 for all soil reactors by monitoring the soil every three days the concentration of agnps in sludge during the first stage sludge conditioning was higher than the second stage application of agnps to soil to be able to have high enough agnps in the samples that can be detected and observed by tem the agnp concentrations were selected based on previous studies liang et al 2010 sun et al 2013 2 4 tem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds analyses particle size shape and morphology were examined using tem fei tecnai g2 f20 netherlands the samples were prepared by placing approximately 5 Âµl of conditioned sludge on 3 05 Âµm supported copper grid film coated with formvar carbon with 200 mesh and a hole size of approximately 97 nm from ted pella inc after preparation the samples were analyzed using an fei tecnai g2 f20 tem at the nano imaging facility nif carleton university there were three sample replicates for each sample in addition to morphological analyses the elemental composition of the samples was analyzed using eds coupled to tem this combination allows eds to provide an elemental composition of an area that is only a few nanometers in diameter the results are shown as a plot of the emitted x rays versus their energy in kev the plot has several peaks each corresponding to a specific element 2 5 single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy sp icp ms and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms total and particulate ag concentrations were analyzed using icp ms and sp icp ms all icp ms analyses were conducted using a perkinelmer nexion 300d icp ms system in three replicates total ag in solutions suspensions was determined after samples were acidified to 1 hno3 tracemetal grade fisher chemical at least 24 h prior to analysis using the standard mode sp icp ms analysis was performed using the same icp ms but operating in single particle mode using the syngistix nano application module perkinelmer inc waltham ma other instrumental and analytical details are available in schwertfeger et al 2017 2 6 chemical analysis all chemical analyses were replicated three times and performed according to standard methods apha et al 2017 the soil was analyzed for cec at the beginning of the experiment using a standard method employed by the natural resources conservation service rebecca 2004 the method involves using 1 m ammonium acetate nh4oac at ph 7 neutral nh4oac soil samples were prepared for ph analysis by suspending 5 g of soil in 5 ml of water 1 g 1 ml ratio vortexing the suspension for 30 s then taking the ph measurement using an orion thermo orion star tm a326 ph do meter the percentages of total solids ts and mc were determined by drying 5 g of the soil sample in an oven at 105 c for 24 h the ts is the sample weight after drying divided by sample weight before drying and multiplied by 100 while the mc is calculated by taking the difference in the sample weight before and after drying dividing it by the weight of the dried sample and multiplying by 100 mc was maintained at 45 for all five soil reactors by taking three measurements every 2 to 3 d the soil reactors were also analyzed for toc using toc vcph cpn and toc control v software for each toc measurement run one blank and one set of the standard solution concentrations were used to construct a calibration curve and three replicates were analyzed soil samples were prepared by suspending 1 g of soil in 10 ml of cacl2 solution 1 10 w v 0 01 m the suspensions were put in a shaker for two hours and centrifuged at 1800 g for 12 min the supernatant was then taken for the toc analysis 2 7 microbiological analyses 2 7 1 heterotrophic plate count changes in the viability of heterotrophic bacteria in the soil samples were investigated every 15 days using the spread plate method tryptic soy agar tsa was used as the growth medium the tsa was prepared by adding 30 g of the powdered tsa to 1 l distilled water and dissolved by boiling after the medium had cooled to approximately 50 c a volume of 22 ml was poured into each petri plate and stored at 4 c for a maximum of one week soil samples were prepared by suspending 0 1 g of the soil samples in 0 9 ml phosphate buffered saline pbs with 0 1 tween 80 and vortexed for 30 s serial dilutions were made and three 0 1 ml replicates of 10e 04 10e 05 and 10e 06 dilutions were inoculated onto the tsa plates and incubated in the dark at 34 1 c colony forming units cfu were calculated after 24 h of incubation 2 7 2 live dead viability assay the viability of bacterial cells in the soil reactors was investigated by staining with fluorescent dyes and observing with the nikon eclipse ti e microscope the soil samples were stained with a baclight staining reagent kit thermo fisher scientific that was prepared by dissolving syto 9 stain and propidium iodide stain in 5 ml of ultrapure water the soil samples were prepared for live dead analysis by suspending 0 1 g of soil in 0 9 ml of pbs solution with 0 1 tween 80 the suspension was vortexed for 30 s at high speed then left to settle for 30 min a known volume of the supernatant was mixed with an equal amount of the staining reagent and the mixture was incubated in the dark for 15 min after which 17 Âµl of the mixture was placed between a slide and a 22 mm square coverslip the samples were then ready for observation under the fluorescence microscope where the ratio of live dead bacterial cells could be quantified three tests were done for each soil sample and three random fields of views fov were chosen on each slide where images were taken three images were taken at each fov using 3 uv filters gfp 1 cy 3 and gfphq to capture live dead and both live and dead microbial cells respectively the three sets of images were assessed and the most representative was chosen to report and the live cell percentage was estimated by dividing the number of live cells by the total number of cells in the image 2 7 3 bacterial population analysis 2 7 3 1 bacterial phyla each soil reactor was analyzed for the presence and relative population of five most prevalent bacterial phyla found in soil and sludge acidobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes and proteobacteria every 15 d over the 105 days experiment three replicate dna extractions were done for each soil reactor using the powersoil dna isolation kit from mo bio laboratories inc qiagen online shop and the concentration of extracted dna was measured using the qubit 2 0 fluorometer with the dsdna hs assay kits molecular probes life technology in most cases the samples were prewashed before the exaction according to a method described by kibbee and Ã¶rmeci 2017 the extracted dna from the samples was then used as template dna for the phylum specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr protocols each phylum was amplified individually using phylum specific qpcr primer sets 2 7 3 2 primers primers were purchased from life technologies burlington ontario primer references and properties are shown in table s 7 2 7 3 3 qpcr protocols and annealing temperature optimization phylum analysis was done using individual qpcr protocol for each soil mixture in each qpcr run there were three replicate qpcr reactions for each genomic dna sample and three controls for all phyla assessed the reactions were performed using the cfx96 touch real time pcr detection system biorad and analyzed with the cfx manager software the qpcr protocols were the same for all phyla except for the annealing temperatures the qpcr protocol consisted of an initial denaturation step at 95 c for 5 min followed by 40 cycles at 95 c for 10 s annealing for 20 s table s 7 an extension at 72 c for 15 s and finally a melt curve analysis from 65 to 95 c with a 0 5 c increase every 5 s every qpcr reaction consisted of 12 5 Î¼l qpcr buffer 0 5 Î¼l 200 nm forward primer 0 5 Î¼l 200 nm reverse primer dna template equilibrated to 30 ng concentration and water to 25 Î¼l as the final reaction volume the qpcr reaction buffer solution was the ssofast evagreen supermix purchased from bio rad laboratories ltd canada which contains dntps sso7d fusion polymerase mgcl2 evagreen dye and stabilizers preliminary experiments were done to optimize the annealing temperature for each phylum protocol and the annealing temperature that maximized the primer amplification was determined using the extracted soil dna as a template in a thermal gradient qpcr reaction with a different annealing temperature range for each phylum 2 7 3 4 qpcr analysis universal 16s ribosomal rna primers were used to amplify an approximately 180 bp sequence which was used to calculate the baseline 16s gene copy number and compare it with each of the five phyla specific calculated gene copy numbers this data generated relative population trends for each phylum over time the data analysis was based on the following fundamental assumptions 1 cq is equivalent to 3 33 log10 target amplicon concentration several studies used a control curve to relate the number concentration of dna in the qpcr product to the corresponding cq svec et al 2015 stated that constructing a control curve with log10 of dna number versus the cq that resulted from the qpcr run of serial concentrations of dna will be linear with a slope of 3 33 when the qpcr efficiency is 100 svec et al 2015 1 every bacterium has 1 fg of dna the concentration of the dna template used in the qpcr reaction was 30 ng the qpcr analysis in this study relies on a relative estimate of the bacterial population if it is assumed that every bacterium has 1 fg of dna then 30 ng of dna is equal to 3 10e 07 bacteria this is a relative estimate because the soil extracted dna is present in many living things other than bacteria such as plants and eukaryotes 1 every phylum has a specific copy number of 16s rrna based on a recent study by vÄtrovskÃ½ and baldrian 2013 each phylum has a specific copy number of 16s rrna as shown in table s 8 2 8 statistical analyses results are reported with the average of three replicates standard deviation unless otherwise stated comparisons and significant differences between different soil reactors over time control 1 versus control 2 and control 2 versus other soil reactors were performed using a one way analysis of variation anova at a 95 confidence level anova is a statistical method that follows a normal data distribution significant differences are those with a p value 0 05 if the anova test indicated a significant difference a t test was performed between each of the two data sets in addition the coefficient of variance cv was estimated for each data set and significant differences are those with a cv 0 05 i e the level of confidence 95 3 results and discussion 3 1 fate of agnps in sludge agnps did not show any chemical or morphological change when suspended in water tem imaging showed that agnps in water remained dispersed with no changes as shown in fig 1 a while in sludge agnps demonstrated chemical and morphological changes soon after they were added to the wastewater sludge from tem observations in fig 1 b agnps went through changes in the presence of the sludge constituents some of the observed changes included surface coating dissolution and agglomeration also fig 1 shows the eds analysis results which display the elemental composition of water and sludge samples fig 1 shows the highest peaks and thus the highest concentrations for carbon c copper cu and silver ag in water the source of silver is the agnps and the source of carbon and copper is the support copper grid film coated with formvar carbon used during the analysis in sludge the eds spectrum showed several peaks for different elements detected in sludge tem images showed that sludge caused chemical and morphological alterations in agnps the changes were likely due to the interactions between agnps and sludge constituents including oxidizers sulfur compounds chloride compounds and organic matter for example the presence of oxidizers in sludge e g o2 and h2o2 can lead to the oxidative dissolution of agnps in which the nanoparticle surface is oxidized to ag2o which forms a layer on the nanoparticle surface zhang et al 2018 the oxidative dissolution of agnps can cause an increase in the nanoparticle size after dissolution with no morphological change which other studies peretyazhko et al 2014 attribute to the ostwald ripening mechanism in which the nanoparticles dissolve and redeposit as larger nanoparticles sulfidation of agnps can also occur and result in several morphological changes including forming a shell of ag2s nps around the agnps surface until all available agnps are converted to ag2s nps thalmann et al 2016 or formation of a nanobridge of ag2s nps that connects agnps with each other levard et al 2011 chlorination of agnps was also reported in previous studies and like sulfidation can form a shell of agcl around the agnps surface which can prevent the dissolution of agnps li et al 2010 in addition the presence of organic matter results in the surface coating of agnps which can stabilize the particles and maintain their dispersive state in the sludge and thus affect the behavior and state of agnps cumberland lead 2009 showed that approximately 1 of the agnps dissolved after agnps average size 13 15 nm were added to a solution containing humic substances and sodium or calcium to mimic environmentally relevant conditions another study by tseng et al 2009 showed that silver ions are not only released from silver salts but metallic silver as well if conditions are suitable 3 2 effect of chemical conditioners on agnps coagulation caused the formation of larger particle clusters sp icp ms analysis was performed to examine the concentration of agnps before and after the conditioning process icp ms and sp icp ms were used to measure the total and particulate silver agnps concentrations in the water and sludge reactors before and after conditioning and dissolved silver concentrations were calculated from these measurements as seen in table 1 the concentration of agnps that was spiked in each water and sludge reactors was 100 mg l but the total silver quantities measured detected by icp ms were 48 5 mg l and 53 mg l for the water and sludge controls and of these 33 and 26 were agnps in water and sludge respectively this indicates that approximately half of the spiked silver was lost during sample pre treatment and filtration steps prior to icp ms and sp icp ms analysis corresponding to similar findings reported by other studies schwertfeger et al 2017 the loss was similar in nanopure water and sludge samples indicating that the loss could not be due to chemical reactions with sludge constituents in addition the slightly higher percentage of silver recovery in sludge 53 rather than water 48 5 may indicate that some of the agnps was likely dissolved in the sludge due to reactions with the sludge constituents allowing for a higher amount of silver to pass through the filter after flocculation there were small quantities of agnps less than 0 39 of total silver in water reactors and 0 06 in sludge reactors remaining in the liquid phase this confirms that the conditioning chemicals were very effective in removing agnps from the aqueous phase by flocculation the concentration of silver detected in all reactors after conditioning was mostly in dissolved form table 1 also only 33 and 26 of 48 5 and 53 mg l total silver were still in the nanoparticle form in the control water and sludge samples indicating that a substantial portion of agnps was dissolved shortly after spiking the silver concentrations in samples conditioned with alum could not be measured due to the interference of aluminum ions with the analytical method and the instrument 3 2 1 inorganic conditioners ferric chloride and alum both resulted in the incorporation of agnps into flocs fig 2 a and b but the formation and structure of the flocs were different ferric chloride and alum dissociate in water and generate fe3 and al3 ions which in turn react with water molecules to create hydrated reaction products such as fe h2o 6 3 and al h2o 6 3 the hydrolysis process can also result in the formation of ferric and aluminum hydroxide fe oh 3 and al oh 3 which can further dissociate into ionic compounds the ions and ionic compounds are adsorbed and deposited on particle surfaces including agnps which leads to the agglomeration of agnps in ferric and alum complexes the performance of ferric chloride and alum and the entrapment of agnps in ferric and aluminum flocs were evident when the agnps were suspended in nanopure water the transformation of agnps in the presence of ferric and aluminum was more complex in sludge than in water due to the presence of sludge constituents 3 2 2 organic conditioner unlike inorganic conditioners such as ferric and aluminum salts synthetic polymers can effectively achieve flocculation without forming chemical precipitates and flocs the addition of polyacrylamide polymer resulted in the coating and aggregation of agnps as illustrated in fig 2 c in sludge the clarity of images was not as good due to the flocculation of sludge particles and organic matter as well as some dissolution of agnps however the results of sp icp ms highlighted the superb capability of polymer to remove agnps from sludge supernatant as the final total silver concentration after polymer conditioning was 0 003 mg l in both water and sludge polymer affects the surface chemistry and charge of agnps and impacts their fate and transformation though this also applies to inorganic conditioners polymers have a much higher molecular weight and charge and thus stronger influence compared to ferric chloride and alum 3 3 impact of agnps on soil health the next phase of the study investigated the effect of agnps treated with organic and inorganic conditioners on soil microorganisms by simulating the land application of biosolids using soil reactors 3 3 1 toc and ph the toc of the soil decreased on the first day sludge was applied to soil day 0 in the ferric chloride and alum reactors this is probably due to the negative effects of these two chemicals on toc a study showed that ferric chloride and alum decreased the concentration of toc in soil after coagulation with each of these two chemicals mesdaghinia et al 2005 however the toc of the other reactors also decreased over time and reached a similar level to the ferric chloride and alum reactors by the end of the experiment as seen in fig 3 a this is likely due to the use of organic carbon by the soil microorganisms an increase in soil toc was observed at a few of the time points and this can be explained by the difficulty of collecting homogenous samples from the soil matrix there were no significant differences between the controls and other three soil reactors over time and based on the t test analysis p values were between 0 4 to 0 9 the toc decrease was high during the first month ranging from 15 to 42 compared to the following months day 30 to 105 where the decrease in toc was not significant p value 0 05 soil ph is considered to play an important role in the soil microbial population and diversity there was one unit decrease in ph from day 0 to day 15 in most reactors as shown in fig 3 b this decrease is considered normal due to the acclimation of chemical reactions and microorganisms to the new environment after day 15 ph readings were stable over the remaining 90 days overall the ph dropped for all reactors from neutral a ph of approximately 7 at the beginning of the experiment to slightly acidic at the end in general ph levels were similar in all soil reactors over time as a result the presence of agnps did not have significant impact on soil toc and ph p value 0 05 in line with studies that showed no effects of agnps and other nanoparticles on soil ph and toc carbone et al 2014 frenk et al 2013 hÃ¤nsch and emmerling 2010 there are several factors that could potentially affect the toc level in soil including ph temperature soil aeration and microbial population the observed decrease in toc could be due to microbial respiration or decomposition and consumption of organic matter by microorganisms which compete to survive in a limited carbon environment no additional carbon was added to the soil reactors during the experiment in addition changes in microbial population and activity occurred over time soil ph is one of the parameters that has a major influence on the availability of nutrients in the soil such as nitrogen and phosphorus at around ph of 7 ammonium nh4 is quickly converted to nitrate no3 in soil and can be easily taken up by plants by plants due to the rapid conversion of ammonium nh4 to nitrate with acidic ph the nitrification process is slow and only ammonium is available as a source of nitrogen for plants in alkaline soil phosphorus tends to form stable minerals which are very difficult to solubilize which is why it is limited in soil under alkaline conditions 3 3 2 heterotrophic plate count and viability on day 0 hpc was similar in all the reactors except that with alum which was half a log10 lower as seen in fig 3 c t test analysis showed no significant difference between controls 1 and 2 p value 0 58 indicating the presence of agnps at this concentration had no significant effect on the heterotrophic bacteria count in the soil the type of conditioners appeared to affect the soil hpc trends over time however the changes were not found to be significant p values were 0 4 0 14 and 0 84 for ferric chloride alum and polymer soil reactors compared to control 2 heterotrophic bacteria use organic compounds as carbon and energy sources after sludge application the alum soil reactor had lower cfu at day 0 likely due to the toxicity of alum on soil microorganisms however the difference in hpc observed was not significant and any toxicity was not sustained as the alum soil reactor had the highest cfu at the end of the experiment indeed the results showed no significant differences in cfu between all the soil reactors which suggests that agnps had no significant impact on heterotrophic bacteria in the soil reactors this is confirmed by previous studies that showed no significant impact of agnps when applied on the soil at 10 mg kg soil however agnps at 100 mg kg soil severely impacted the hpc in the soil carbone et al 2014 the severity of the impact is dependent on the agnps concentration used as well as the sludge treatment before land application the effects of agnps on soil microorganisms were also investigated through the live dead bacterial viability assay on day 0 the percentage of live cells was similar in all reactors fluctuations were observed over time but anova analysis showed no significant differences among the reactors p value 0 05 the percentage of live cells remained same over time in most reactors as shown in fig 3 d as live dead staining is a general representation of the overall bacterial viability and does not assess the bacterial communities in the soil the fluctuations may be due to specific genera or species adapting and thriving to the experimental conditions bacterial live dead staining images are presented in the supplementary data figures s 1 to s 5 3 3 3 soil phyla the soil genomic dna extractions figure s 6 were analyzed for the presence of five selected phyla using qpcr the results were used to determine the average abundance of phyla in all reactors as shown in fig 4 a overall the results showed that acidobacteria was the most abundant phylum among the five assessed and bacteroidetes was the least abundant there were little differences in calculated cfu equivalent cce for each phylum between controls 1 and 2 as shown in fig 4 b the anova analysis also indicated no major differences in the abundance of the studied phyla between controls 1 and 2 and the calculated p values were 0 6 0 52 0 43 0 84 and 0 04 for acidobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes and proteobacteria respectively this indicates that agnps at a concentration of 20 mg agnps g soil had minimal impact on the presence and diversity of the assessed phyla except for proteobacteria which might be considered significantly affected by the agnps p value was 0 04 there was less than one log10 cce increase or decrease in each phylum in both controls 1 and 2 acidobacteria was the only phyla that showed an increase in cce in all soil reactors as shown in fig 5 a this indicates that it can thrive in the presence of agnps and different sludge chemical treatments the results and statistical analyses showed no major differences in cce of acidobacteria in all soil reactors with a p value ranging from 0 6 to 0 9 the ferric chloride reactor had the highest growth rate an increase of 21 over time for this phylum while growth rates for the other soil reactors ranged from 4 to 10 over 105 days experiment duration actinobacteria did not show a significant increase or decrease in cce in all reactors during the experiments as shown in fig 5 b and anova showed no significant differences p value 0 05 all reactors followed similar trends with no appreciable differences in cce except for the ferric chloride treatment that seemed to promote actinobacteria growth with a 25 increase in cce over the 105 days experiment time frame the relative cce of bacteroidetes showed no significant differences between control 2 and the other soil reactors as shown in fig 5 c p value 0 05 however the bacteroidetes cce increased in the ferric chloride and alum reactors decreased with the remaining treatment and was relatively similar in controls 1 and 2 these results indicate that ferric and alum promoted the growth of this phylum in the soil reactors no significant differences were observed in the relative cce of firmicutes between controls 1 and 2 which indicate that agnps at this concentration had no significant effect on the population of this phylum however as shown in fig 5 d control 1 remained relatively stable with only a slight decrease on day 75 followed by a slight increase while control 2 decreased steadily throughout the experiment the results of the relative cce of firmicutes showed that compared to control 2 the alum reactor had the highest difference p value 0 00023 followed by ferric chloride p value 0 072 the polymer reactor had no significant difference with control 2 p value 0 45 these results suggest that the type of chemicals used in sludge treatment had an impact on the population of this phylum proteobacteria was the only phylum that had significant differences in the relative cce between controls 1 and 2 as shown in fig 5 e indicating an adverse effect of the agnps on the proteobacteria population in the soil however the p value was 0 04 which was only slightly lower than Î± 0 05 and control 1 increased by 5 compared to control 2 which had no increase or decrease the other soil reactors showed no significant differences in proteobacteria cce compared to control 2 however there was a minor decrease of 1 6 in proteobacteria cce in the polymer reactor and slight increases from 1 to 7 in the remaining reactors genomic dna for all soil reactors was analyzed for the presence of the five most common phyla in soil and sludge using qpcr in general the results showed no significant difference in cce for each phylum between controls 1 and 2 at each time point indicating that agnps at this concentration had minimal effect on the presence and diversity of these phyla in the soil reactors over the duration of the experiment some new findings were revealed when the presence and diversity of the five phyla assessed in the other soil reactors were analyzed fig 5 acidobacteria cce continued to increase regardless of the presence of agnps and conditioning chemicals this supports previous studies that have shown that the phylum acidobacteria have the highest tolerance to agnps yang et al 2014 furthermore the change in each phylum over time under different sludge conditioners was not statistically significant p value 0 05 in addition the ferric chloride treatment seemed to promote the growth of all phyla while the polymer treatment reduced phyla growth over time with the exception of acidobacteria this was expected as iron plays a vital role in cell metabolism and polymers exert toxicity and have been shown to enhance the antimicrobial activity of agnps kvitek et al 2008 thus in this case the impact on the soil phyla was more likely due to the type of conditioning chemical rather than the presence of agnps dissolution and release of silver ions ag are believed to be the main cause of agnps toxicity xiu et al 2012 agnps might have reacted with sludge constituents or conditioning chemicals which likely lowered their toxicity several studies showed that sulfidation of agnps during wastewater and sludge treatment produce ag2s which is very stable and less toxic than agnps ma et al 2013 wang et al 2018 agnps toxicity is caused by their very large surface area to volume ratio which enables them to easily penetrate the cell wall react with sulfur and phosphorus containing compounds of dna and lead to cell death toxicity can be reduced by the reaction of agnps with sludge constituents and conditioning chemicals and the resulting change in their chemistry and morphology in addition exposure time is considered an important factor in the toxicity assessment of nanoparticles for example agnps at a concentration range of 0 01 1 mg agnps kg soil did not affect soil biological activities over the short term however after a year of exposure 0 01 mg agnps kg soil the agnps were shown to significantly impact the soil microbial biomass bacterial ammonia oxidizers and the abundance of nitrogen fixing microorganisms grÃ¼n et al 2018 overall the results of the study indicate that land application of biosolids at 20 mg agnps kg soil does not have a significant adverse impact on the soil microorganisms and health it is likely that no significant impact on plants would be observed at these concentrations either a large percentage of agnps dissolved almost immedaitely after addition to sludge and only a small fraction was still in the nanoparticle form sludge conditioners also did not show significant impacts on soil health at the concentrations used it is important to note that the concentrations of agnps and sludge conditioners used in this study were environmentally relevant and realistic concentrations 4 conclusions this study evaluated the fate and removal of agnps during chemical conditioning of sludge with ferric chloride alum and polyacrylamide polymer and their impact on soil bacteria and health after simulated land application of biosolids the study employed environmentally relevant agnps concentrations and used conditioned agnps rather than virgin agnps for simulated land application to provide more realistic representation of what might occur in the field the main findings of this study were ferric chloride alum and synthetic polymers were very effective 99 in removing agnps from the liquid phase and concentrating them in sludge solids the incorporation of nanoparticles and the structure of flocs had different characteristics for each conditioner agnps went through rapid physical chemical and morphological changes in sludge including coating dissolution and agglomeration these changes were not immediately observed in nanopure water a large percentage of agnps dissolved soon after spiking and only one quarter to one third still remained in the nanoparticle form after simulated land application of biosolids agnps at 2 mg agnps g ts sludge corresponding to 20 mg agnps kg soil did not have a significant impact on the soil bacterial population and health as assessed by the five most prevalent phyla acidobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes and proteobacteria hpc and percentage of live cells in soil ferric chloride alum and polymer alone did not show consistent significant impacts on soil bacteria and health either this is the first study to investigate the impact of organic and inorganic conditioners on agnps the study provides insight into the potential impact of agnps and sludge conditioners on the key microorganisms involved in soil biological activities and overall soil health the study also provides a solid basis for further research in the risk assessment

16572,the growing use of silver nanoparticles agnps in personal care products and clothing has increased their concentrations in wastewater and subsequently in sludge raising concerns about their fate and toxicity during wastewater treatment and after land application of sludge this research investigated the fate and removal of agnps during chemical conditioning of anaerobically digested sludge and their impact on soil bacteria and health after land application ferric chloride fecl3 alum al2 so4 3 14 18 h2o and synthetic polyacrylamide polymer were used for sludge conditioning all conditioners effectively removed agnps from the liquid phase and concentrated them in sludge solids concentration analyses showed that out of 53 0 mg l of silver in the sludge only 0 1 to 0 003 mg l of silver remained in the sludge supernatant after conditioning and 12 to 20 of this value were particulates morphological analyses also showed that agnps went through physical chemical and morphological changes in sludge that were not observed in nanopure water and the resulting floc structures and the incorporation of nanoparticles were different for each conditioner the impact of conditioned agnps on the biological activities of soil was evaluated by investigating its impact on the presence of five important phyla acidobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes and proteobacteria the results showed that agnps at a concentration of 20 mg agnps g soil had a minimal impact on the presence and diversity of the assessed phyla also using different chemicals for sludge conditioning resulted in different growth behavior of studied phyla this study provides new insight into how the presence of agnps and different chemicals used for sludge conditioning might impact the soil biological activities and hence plant growth the study also provides a solid basis for further research in the risk assessment of nanoparticle toxicity in biosolids amended soils graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords silver nanoparticles sludge conditioning polymer inorganic conditioner land application 1 introduction silver nanoparticles agnps have received attention in recent years due to their wide use as antimicrobial agents in commercial products and consequently their higher concentrations in the environment compared to other nanoparticles several studies demonstrated the toxicity of agnps on aquatic and terrestrial organisms including plants algae fungi fish earthworms and bacteria shoults wilson et al 2011 colman et al 2013 cunningham et al 2013 masrahi et al 2014 tortella et al 2020 agnps and other nanoparticles used in commercial products e g cosmetics sunscreen shampoo disinfectants textiles laundry products ultimately end up in sewers benn and westerhoff 2008 geranio et al 2009 benn et al 2010 mohan et al 2019 for instance benn et al 2010 showed that different type of tested products a shirt a medical mask and cloth toothpaste shampoo detergent a towel a toy teddy bear and two humidifiers with concentrations of 1 4 to 270 000 Î¼g ag g can release silver in quantities of up to 45 Î¼g ag g product when these products are washed studies have also shown that significant amounts of agnps entering wastewater streams accumulate in treated sludge biosolids kaegi et al 2011 schlich et al 2013 schlich et al 2013 reported that more than 90 of agnps remain attached to wastewater sludge this raises questions about the impact of agnps on biological treatment processes as well as the impact of treatment processes on the fate and transformation of agnps during wastewater and sludge treatment in addition the impact agnps have on the soil ecosystem following the application of biosolids to agricultural lands is not well understood chemical conditioning is required to improve the solid liquid separation before sludge dewatering both inorganic conditioners i e ferric chloride alum lime and organic conditioners i e synthetic polymers are used for chemical conditioning chemical conditioners typically have a high molecular weight and charge they are also added in high concentrations and thus can impact the chemistry morphology fate and behavior of nanoparticles there are major research gaps on the fate and transformation of nanoparticles during treatment processes and studies have so far largely focused on biological treatment processes wang et al 2017 lombi et al 2013 and ma et al 2013 investigated the status of agnps during anaerobic digestion and composting and reported that most of the initial agnps were converted to ag2s and that several factors such as surface coating agnps characteristics and treatment conditions played a role there is relatively little information available on the effect of chemical treatment processes on metallic nanoparticles and no prior study has investigated the effect of organic and inorganic conditioners on the fate and impact of agnps during sludge conditioning beneficial use of biosolids as a fertilizer through land application on agricultural soils is the main form of sludge disposal in many countries due to its low cost land application provides the means to recycle nutrients and organic carbon but may also add unwanted contaminants such as agnps to the soil studies have shown that agnps which are typically used as antibacterial agents could impact soil microbial activities colman et al 2013 schlich et al 2016 samarajeewa et al 2017 abdulsada et al 2021a 2021b this is a concern as soil organisms are responsible for organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling and determine the overall soil health the main objective of this study was to investigate the fate transformation and removal of agnps during chemical conditioning of sludge with ferric chloride alum and polymer the study also aimed to determine the impact of agnps on soil microorganisms and health after sludge application this is the first study to investigate the impact of organic and inorganic conditioners on agnps the study employed environmentally relevant agnp concentrations and used conditioned agnps rather than virgin agnps for simulated land application to provide more realistic representation of what might occur in the field 2 materials and methods 2 1 agnps sludge and soil characteristics pristine silver nanoparticles 99 9 purity were purchased from nanocomposix inc san diego ca usa the physical and chemical properties of the silver nanoparticles are shown in table s1 supplementary material the particle size distribution of agnps was examined and confirmed by transmission electron microscopy tem analysis before use and the agnps stock solution was stored at 4 c anaerobically digested sludge was obtained from the robert o pickard environmental center ropec in ottawa canada the sludge was collected from mesophilic anaerobic digesters and its chemical properties are provided in table s2 loamy topsoil from artistic landscape designs ltd ottawa canada without compost or chemical fertilizer was used to simulate the land application of biosolids loamy soil combines all three types of soil particles sand silt and clay in relatively equal amounts that gives a proper and healthy balance of soil types a loamy topsoil is a loamy soil that was taken from the top 30 cm of the ground soil samples were sieved through a sieve with 2 mm opening air dried and stored at 4 c until use initial soil analyses measured total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn total phosphorus ph and cation exchange capacity cec as presented in table s3 2 2 organic and inorganic conditioners two inorganic conditioners ferric chloride fecl3 and alum al2 so4 3 14 18 h2o and one organic conditioner polyacrylamide polymer were assessed to determine their effect on agnps during sludge conditioning these chemicals were chosen because they are widely used for sludge conditioning and dewatering at wastewater treatment plants their concentrations were selected after preliminary conditioning and dewatering experiments to find the optimal dose for each coagulant table s4 ferric chloride was purchased from fisher scientific canada in powder form and a stock solution was prepared at a concentration of 40 mg ml 4 w v alum was purchased from anachemia canada inc in granular form and a stock solution was prepared at a concentration of 170 mg ml 17 the organic conditioner flopolymer ca 4600 snf canada was a dry cationic polyacrylamide polymer with a high charge density and high molecular weight a stock solution of the polymer was prepared at a concentration of 2 mg ml 0 2 by rapid mixing for an hour with a magnetic bar stirrer slow mixing for another hour and then resting for an hour before use 2 3 experimental design 2 3 1 chemical conditioning the study was performed in two stages the first stage investigated the effect of chemical conditioning on the fate and removal of agnps chemical conditioning was conducted in two different media nanopure water and anaerobically digested sludge nanopure water was used as a reference media to observe the interaction of agnps and chemical conditioners in the absence of other contaminants nanopure and ultrapure water are purified until the last trace of impurities are removed for all contaminant types and they are both atsm type i water with less than 1 cfu ml bacteria they are the names used by different manufacturers of water purification units barnstead and millipore both waters were used in this study there were four reactors for both nanopure water and sludge one was the control which had no conditioners and the other three reactors had different chemical conditioners one reactor for each conditioner table s5 illustrates the contents of each reactor agnps were added to each reactor at a concentration of 0 1 mg ml that corresponds to 5 60 1 05 mg agnps g sludge dry weight for the sludge reactor and vortexed for 30 s after spiking with agnps coagulation and flocculation were performed for each water and sludge reactor using three conditioners the conditioning step was carried out by adding the chemical conditioner rapid mixing for 1 min and slow mixing for 30 min the ph was recorded after the chemical addition and for ferric chloride and alum was adjusted using 1 m naoh sodium hydroxide table s5 also illustrates the concentrations of the conditioning chemicals dosed and the ph values in water and sludge reactors after conditioning water and sludge samples were prepared for morphological and concentration analyses 2 3 2 simulated land application the second stage of this study examined the effect of agnps on the relative population of selected phyla in soil after sludge application five 250 ml clean glass beakers were each filled with 100 g soil and the agnps and conditioner concentrations spiked in these soil reactors are provided in table s 6 there were two controls control 1 received unconditioned anaerobically digested sludge that had no agnps while control 2 received the same sludge but was previously mixed with agnps the other three reactors received sludge that was mixed with the same concentration of agnps and was subjected to chemical conditioning using a different coagulant for each reactor as described in stage one a volume of 62 ml of anaerobically digested sludge with 2 initial solids concentration was added to each soil reactor after the addition of sludge the soil moisture content mc was 60 at the start of the experiment the sludge soil ratio was 0 01 g g dry weight and it was selected based on the biosolids land application guidelines at a rate of 8 ton ha every 5 years ome and omafr 1996 in addition other studies were considered in choosing the sludge application ratio colman et al 2013 whitley et al 2013 johansson et al 1999 the initial agnps concentration in sludge before conditioning was 2 mg agnps g sludge dry weight that corresponded to 20 mg agnps kg soil when sludge was combined with soil the agnps concentration used represents the higher range of the published values of their predicted and recorded concentrations in wastewater sludge ccme 2010 epa 2018 blaser et al 2008 gottschalk et al 2013 the reactors were incubated with day night cycles of 8 16 h at a constant temperature of 22 1 c this study was carried out for 105 days during which chemical and biological analyses were conducted every 15 d to examine changes in soil characteristics and microbial activity over time the analyses were done by withdrawing 2 3 g of soil from each reactor every 15 days throughout the experiments mc was maintained at 45 for all soil reactors by monitoring the soil every three days the concentration of agnps in sludge during the first stage sludge conditioning was higher than the second stage application of agnps to soil to be able to have high enough agnps in the samples that can be detected and observed by tem the agnp concentrations were selected based on previous studies liang et al 2010 sun et al 2013 2 4 tem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds analyses particle size shape and morphology were examined using tem fei tecnai g2 f20 netherlands the samples were prepared by placing approximately 5 Âµl of conditioned sludge on 3 05 Âµm supported copper grid film coated with formvar carbon with 200 mesh and a hole size of approximately 97 nm from ted pella inc after preparation the samples were analyzed using an fei tecnai g2 f20 tem at the nano imaging facility nif carleton university there were three sample replicates for each sample in addition to morphological analyses the elemental composition of the samples was analyzed using eds coupled to tem this combination allows eds to provide an elemental composition of an area that is only a few nanometers in diameter the results are shown as a plot of the emitted x rays versus their energy in kev the plot has several peaks each corresponding to a specific element 2 5 single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy sp icp ms and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms total and particulate ag concentrations were analyzed using icp ms and sp icp ms all icp ms analyses were conducted using a perkinelmer nexion 300d icp ms system in three replicates total ag in solutions suspensions was determined after samples were acidified to 1 hno3 tracemetal grade fisher chemical at least 24 h prior to analysis using the standard mode sp icp ms analysis was performed using the same icp ms but operating in single particle mode using the syngistix nano application module perkinelmer inc waltham ma other instrumental and analytical details are available in schwertfeger et al 2017 2 6 chemical analysis all chemical analyses were replicated three times and performed according to standard methods apha et al 2017 the soil was analyzed for cec at the beginning of the experiment using a standard method employed by the natural resources conservation service rebecca 2004 the method involves using 1 m ammonium acetate nh4oac at ph 7 neutral nh4oac soil samples were prepared for ph analysis by suspending 5 g of soil in 5 ml of water 1 g 1 ml ratio vortexing the suspension for 30 s then taking the ph measurement using an orion thermo orion star tm a326 ph do meter the percentages of total solids ts and mc were determined by drying 5 g of the soil sample in an oven at 105 c for 24 h the ts is the sample weight after drying divided by sample weight before drying and multiplied by 100 while the mc is calculated by taking the difference in the sample weight before and after drying dividing it by the weight of the dried sample and multiplying by 100 mc was maintained at 45 for all five soil reactors by taking three measurements every 2 to 3 d the soil reactors were also analyzed for toc using toc vcph cpn and toc control v software for each toc measurement run one blank and one set of the standard solution concentrations were used to construct a calibration curve and three replicates were analyzed soil samples were prepared by suspending 1 g of soil in 10 ml of cacl2 solution 1 10 w v 0 01 m the suspensions were put in a shaker for two hours and centrifuged at 1800 g for 12 min the supernatant was then taken for the toc analysis 2 7 microbiological analyses 2 7 1 heterotrophic plate count changes in the viability of heterotrophic bacteria in the soil samples were investigated every 15 days using the spread plate method tryptic soy agar tsa was used as the growth medium the tsa was prepared by adding 30 g of the powdered tsa to 1 l distilled water and dissolved by boiling after the medium had cooled to approximately 50 c a volume of 22 ml was poured into each petri plate and stored at 4 c for a maximum of one week soil samples were prepared by suspending 0 1 g of the soil samples in 0 9 ml phosphate buffered saline pbs with 0 1 tween 80 and vortexed for 30 s serial dilutions were made and three 0 1 ml replicates of 10e 04 10e 05 and 10e 06 dilutions were inoculated onto the tsa plates and incubated in the dark at 34 1 c colony forming units cfu were calculated after 24 h of incubation 2 7 2 live dead viability assay the viability of bacterial cells in the soil reactors was investigated by staining with fluorescent dyes and observing with the nikon eclipse ti e microscope the soil samples were stained with a baclight staining reagent kit thermo fisher scientific that was prepared by dissolving syto 9 stain and propidium iodide stain in 5 ml of ultrapure water the soil samples were prepared for live dead analysis by suspending 0 1 g of soil in 0 9 ml of pbs solution with 0 1 tween 80 the suspension was vortexed for 30 s at high speed then left to settle for 30 min a known volume of the supernatant was mixed with an equal amount of the staining reagent and the mixture was incubated in the dark for 15 min after which 17 Âµl of the mixture was placed between a slide and a 22 mm square coverslip the samples were then ready for observation under the fluorescence microscope where the ratio of live dead bacterial cells could be quantified three tests were done for each soil sample and three random fields of views fov were chosen on each slide where images were taken three images were taken at each fov using 3 uv filters gfp 1 cy 3 and gfphq to capture live dead and both live and dead microbial cells respectively the three sets of images were assessed and the most representative was chosen to report and the live cell percentage was estimated by dividing the number of live cells by the total number of cells in the image 2 7 3 bacterial population analysis 2 7 3 1 bacterial phyla each soil reactor was analyzed for the presence and relative population of five most prevalent bacterial phyla found in soil and sludge acidobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes and proteobacteria every 15 d over the 105 days experiment three replicate dna extractions were done for each soil reactor using the powersoil dna isolation kit from mo bio laboratories inc qiagen online shop and the concentration of extracted dna was measured using the qubit 2 0 fluorometer with the dsdna hs assay kits molecular probes life technology in most cases the samples were prewashed before the exaction according to a method described by kibbee and Ã¶rmeci 2017 the extracted dna from the samples was then used as template dna for the phylum specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr protocols each phylum was amplified individually using phylum specific qpcr primer sets 2 7 3 2 primers primers were purchased from life technologies burlington ontario primer references and properties are shown in table s 7 2 7 3 3 qpcr protocols and annealing temperature optimization phylum analysis was done using individual qpcr protocol for each soil mixture in each qpcr run there were three replicate qpcr reactions for each genomic dna sample and three controls for all phyla assessed the reactions were performed using the cfx96 touch real time pcr detection system biorad and analyzed with the cfx manager software the qpcr protocols were the same for all phyla except for the annealing temperatures the qpcr protocol consisted of an initial denaturation step at 95 c for 5 min followed by 40 cycles at 95 c for 10 s annealing for 20 s table s 7 an extension at 72 c for 15 s and finally a melt curve analysis from 65 to 95 c with a 0 5 c increase every 5 s every qpcr reaction consisted of 12 5 Î¼l qpcr buffer 0 5 Î¼l 200 nm forward primer 0 5 Î¼l 200 nm reverse primer dna template equilibrated to 30 ng concentration and water to 25 Î¼l as the final reaction volume the qpcr reaction buffer solution was the ssofast evagreen supermix purchased from bio rad laboratories ltd canada which contains dntps sso7d fusion polymerase mgcl2 evagreen dye and stabilizers preliminary experiments were done to optimize the annealing temperature for each phylum protocol and the annealing temperature that maximized the primer amplification was determined using the extracted soil dna as a template in a thermal gradient qpcr reaction with a different annealing temperature range for each phylum 2 7 3 4 qpcr analysis universal 16s ribosomal rna primers were used to amplify an approximately 180 bp sequence which was used to calculate the baseline 16s gene copy number and compare it with each of the five phyla specific calculated gene copy numbers this data generated relative population trends for each phylum over time the data analysis was based on the following fundamental assumptions 1 cq is equivalent to 3 33 log10 target amplicon concentration several studies used a control curve to relate the number concentration of dna in the qpcr product to the corresponding cq svec et al 2015 stated that constructing a control curve with log10 of dna number versus the cq that resulted from the qpcr run of serial concentrations of dna will be linear with a slope of 3 33 when the qpcr efficiency is 100 svec et al 2015 1 every bacterium has 1 fg of dna the concentration of the dna template used in the qpcr reaction was 30 ng the qpcr analysis in this study relies on a relative estimate of the bacterial population if it is assumed that every bacterium has 1 fg of dna then 30 ng of dna is equal to 3 10e 07 bacteria this is a relative estimate because the soil extracted dna is present in many living things other than bacteria such as plants and eukaryotes 1 every phylum has a specific copy number of 16s rrna based on a recent study by vÄtrovskÃ½ and baldrian 2013 each phylum has a specific copy number of 16s rrna as shown in table s 8 2 8 statistical analyses results are reported with the average of three replicates standard deviation unless otherwise stated comparisons and significant differences between different soil reactors over time control 1 versus control 2 and control 2 versus other soil reactors were performed using a one way analysis of variation anova at a 95 confidence level anova is a statistical method that follows a normal data distribution significant differences are those with a p value 0 05 if the anova test indicated a significant difference a t test was performed between each of the two data sets in addition the coefficient of variance cv was estimated for each data set and significant differences are those with a cv 0 05 i e the level of confidence 95 3 results and discussion 3 1 fate of agnps in sludge agnps did not show any chemical or morphological change when suspended in water tem imaging showed that agnps in water remained dispersed with no changes as shown in fig 1 a while in sludge agnps demonstrated chemical and morphological changes soon after they were added to the wastewater sludge from tem observations in fig 1 b agnps went through changes in the presence of the sludge constituents some of the observed changes included surface coating dissolution and agglomeration also fig 1 shows the eds analysis results which display the elemental composition of water and sludge samples fig 1 shows the highest peaks and thus the highest concentrations for carbon c copper cu and silver ag in water the source of silver is the agnps and the source of carbon and copper is the support copper grid film coated with formvar carbon used during the analysis in sludge the eds spectrum showed several peaks for different elements detected in sludge tem images showed that sludge caused chemical and morphological alterations in agnps the changes were likely due to the interactions between agnps and sludge constituents including oxidizers sulfur compounds chloride compounds and organic matter for example the presence of oxidizers in sludge e g o2 and h2o2 can lead to the oxidative dissolution of agnps in which the nanoparticle surface is oxidized to ag2o which forms a layer on the nanoparticle surface zhang et al 2018 the oxidative dissolution of agnps can cause an increase in the nanoparticle size after dissolution with no morphological change which other studies peretyazhko et al 2014 attribute to the ostwald ripening mechanism in which the nanoparticles dissolve and redeposit as larger nanoparticles sulfidation of agnps can also occur and result in several morphological changes including forming a shell of ag2s nps around the agnps surface until all available agnps are converted to ag2s nps thalmann et al 2016 or formation of a nanobridge of ag2s nps that connects agnps with each other levard et al 2011 chlorination of agnps was also reported in previous studies and like sulfidation can form a shell of agcl around the agnps surface which can prevent the dissolution of agnps li et al 2010 in addition the presence of organic matter results in the surface coating of agnps which can stabilize the particles and maintain their dispersive state in the sludge and thus affect the behavior and state of agnps cumberland lead 2009 showed that approximately 1 of the agnps dissolved after agnps average size 13 15 nm were added to a solution containing humic substances and sodium or calcium to mimic environmentally relevant conditions another study by tseng et al 2009 showed that silver ions are not only released from silver salts but metallic silver as well if conditions are suitable 3 2 effect of chemical conditioners on agnps coagulation caused the formation of larger particle clusters sp icp ms analysis was performed to examine the concentration of agnps before and after the conditioning process icp ms and sp icp ms were used to measure the total and particulate silver agnps concentrations in the water and sludge reactors before and after conditioning and dissolved silver concentrations were calculated from these measurements as seen in table 1 the concentration of agnps that was spiked in each water and sludge reactors was 100 mg l but the total silver quantities measured detected by icp ms were 48 5 mg l and 53 mg l for the water and sludge controls and of these 33 and 26 were agnps in water and sludge respectively this indicates that approximately half of the spiked silver was lost during sample pre treatment and filtration steps prior to icp ms and sp icp ms analysis corresponding to similar findings reported by other studies schwertfeger et al 2017 the loss was similar in nanopure water and sludge samples indicating that the loss could not be due to chemical reactions with sludge constituents in addition the slightly higher percentage of silver recovery in sludge 53 rather than water 48 5 may indicate that some of the agnps was likely dissolved in the sludge due to reactions with the sludge constituents allowing for a higher amount of silver to pass through the filter after flocculation there were small quantities of agnps less than 0 39 of total silver in water reactors and 0 06 in sludge reactors remaining in the liquid phase this confirms that the conditioning chemicals were very effective in removing agnps from the aqueous phase by flocculation the concentration of silver detected in all reactors after conditioning was mostly in dissolved form table 1 also only 33 and 26 of 48 5 and 53 mg l total silver were still in the nanoparticle form in the control water and sludge samples indicating that a substantial portion of agnps was dissolved shortly after spiking the silver concentrations in samples conditioned with alum could not be measured due to the interference of aluminum ions with the analytical method and the instrument 3 2 1 inorganic conditioners ferric chloride and alum both resulted in the incorporation of agnps into flocs fig 2 a and b but the formation and structure of the flocs were different ferric chloride and alum dissociate in water and generate fe3 and al3 ions which in turn react with water molecules to create hydrated reaction products such as fe h2o 6 3 and al h2o 6 3 the hydrolysis process can also result in the formation of ferric and aluminum hydroxide fe oh 3 and al oh 3 which can further dissociate into ionic compounds the ions and ionic compounds are adsorbed and deposited on particle surfaces including agnps which leads to the agglomeration of agnps in ferric and alum complexes the performance of ferric chloride and alum and the entrapment of agnps in ferric and aluminum flocs were evident when the agnps were suspended in nanopure water the transformation of agnps in the presence of ferric and aluminum was more complex in sludge than in water due to the presence of sludge constituents 3 2 2 organic conditioner unlike inorganic conditioners such as ferric and aluminum salts synthetic polymers can effectively achieve flocculation without forming chemical precipitates and flocs the addition of polyacrylamide polymer resulted in the coating and aggregation of agnps as illustrated in fig 2 c in sludge the clarity of images was not as good due to the flocculation of sludge particles and organic matter as well as some dissolution of agnps however the results of sp icp ms highlighted the superb capability of polymer to remove agnps from sludge supernatant as the final total silver concentration after polymer conditioning was 0 003 mg l in both water and sludge polymer affects the surface chemistry and charge of agnps and impacts their fate and transformation though this also applies to inorganic conditioners polymers have a much higher molecular weight and charge and thus stronger influence compared to ferric chloride and alum 3 3 impact of agnps on soil health the next phase of the study investigated the effect of agnps treated with organic and inorganic conditioners on soil microorganisms by simulating the land application of biosolids using soil reactors 3 3 1 toc and ph the toc of the soil decreased on the first day sludge was applied to soil day 0 in the ferric chloride and alum reactors this is probably due to the negative effects of these two chemicals on toc a study showed that ferric chloride and alum decreased the concentration of toc in soil after coagulation with each of these two chemicals mesdaghinia et al 2005 however the toc of the other reactors also decreased over time and reached a similar level to the ferric chloride and alum reactors by the end of the experiment as seen in fig 3 a this is likely due to the use of organic carbon by the soil microorganisms an increase in soil toc was observed at a few of the time points and this can be explained by the difficulty of collecting homogenous samples from the soil matrix there were no significant differences between the controls and other three soil reactors over time and based on the t test analysis p values were between 0 4 to 0 9 the toc decrease was high during the first month ranging from 15 to 42 compared to the following months day 30 to 105 where the decrease in toc was not significant p value 0 05 soil ph is considered to play an important role in the soil microbial population and diversity there was one unit decrease in ph from day 0 to day 15 in most reactors as shown in fig 3 b this decrease is considered normal due to the acclimation of chemical reactions and microorganisms to the new environment after day 15 ph readings were stable over the remaining 90 days overall the ph dropped for all reactors from neutral a ph of approximately 7 at the beginning of the experiment to slightly acidic at the end in general ph levels were similar in all soil reactors over time as a result the presence of agnps did not have significant impact on soil toc and ph p value 0 05 in line with studies that showed no effects of agnps and other nanoparticles on soil ph and toc carbone et al 2014 frenk et al 2013 hÃ¤nsch and emmerling 2010 there are several factors that could potentially affect the toc level in soil including ph temperature soil aeration and microbial population the observed decrease in toc could be due to microbial respiration or decomposition and consumption of organic matter by microorganisms which compete to survive in a limited carbon environment no additional carbon was added to the soil reactors during the experiment in addition changes in microbial population and activity occurred over time soil ph is one of the parameters that has a major influence on the availability of nutrients in the soil such as nitrogen and phosphorus at around ph of 7 ammonium nh4 is quickly converted to nitrate no3 in soil and can be easily taken up by plants by plants due to the rapid conversion of ammonium nh4 to nitrate with acidic ph the nitrification process is slow and only ammonium is available as a source of nitrogen for plants in alkaline soil phosphorus tends to form stable minerals which are very difficult to solubilize which is why it is limited in soil under alkaline conditions 3 3 2 heterotrophic plate count and viability on day 0 hpc was similar in all the reactors except that with alum which was half a log10 lower as seen in fig 3 c t test analysis showed no significant difference between controls 1 and 2 p value 0 58 indicating the presence of agnps at this concentration had no significant effect on the heterotrophic bacteria count in the soil the type of conditioners appeared to affect the soil hpc trends over time however the changes were not found to be significant p values were 0 4 0 14 and 0 84 for ferric chloride alum and polymer soil reactors compared to control 2 heterotrophic bacteria use organic compounds as carbon and energy sources after sludge application the alum soil reactor had lower cfu at day 0 likely due to the toxicity of alum on soil microorganisms however the difference in hpc observed was not significant and any toxicity was not sustained as the alum soil reactor had the highest cfu at the end of the experiment indeed the results showed no significant differences in cfu between all the soil reactors which suggests that agnps had no significant impact on heterotrophic bacteria in the soil reactors this is confirmed by previous studies that showed no significant impact of agnps when applied on the soil at 10 mg kg soil however agnps at 100 mg kg soil severely impacted the hpc in the soil carbone et al 2014 the severity of the impact is dependent on the agnps concentration used as well as the sludge treatment before land application the effects of agnps on soil microorganisms were also investigated through the live dead bacterial viability assay on day 0 the percentage of live cells was similar in all reactors fluctuations were observed over time but anova analysis showed no significant differences among the reactors p value 0 05 the percentage of live cells remained same over time in most reactors as shown in fig 3 d as live dead staining is a general representation of the overall bacterial viability and does not assess the bacterial communities in the soil the fluctuations may be due to specific genera or species adapting and thriving to the experimental conditions bacterial live dead staining images are presented in the supplementary data figures s 1 to s 5 3 3 3 soil phyla the soil genomic dna extractions figure s 6 were analyzed for the presence of five selected phyla using qpcr the results were used to determine the average abundance of phyla in all reactors as shown in fig 4 a overall the results showed that acidobacteria was the most abundant phylum among the five assessed and bacteroidetes was the least abundant there were little differences in calculated cfu equivalent cce for each phylum between controls 1 and 2 as shown in fig 4 b the anova analysis also indicated no major differences in the abundance of the studied phyla between controls 1 and 2 and the calculated p values were 0 6 0 52 0 43 0 84 and 0 04 for acidobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes and proteobacteria respectively this indicates that agnps at a concentration of 20 mg agnps g soil had minimal impact on the presence and diversity of the assessed phyla except for proteobacteria which might be considered significantly affected by the agnps p value was 0 04 there was less than one log10 cce increase or decrease in each phylum in both controls 1 and 2 acidobacteria was the only phyla that showed an increase in cce in all soil reactors as shown in fig 5 a this indicates that it can thrive in the presence of agnps and different sludge chemical treatments the results and statistical analyses showed no major differences in cce of acidobacteria in all soil reactors with a p value ranging from 0 6 to 0 9 the ferric chloride reactor had the highest growth rate an increase of 21 over time for this phylum while growth rates for the other soil reactors ranged from 4 to 10 over 105 days experiment duration actinobacteria did not show a significant increase or decrease in cce in all reactors during the experiments as shown in fig 5 b and anova showed no significant differences p value 0 05 all reactors followed similar trends with no appreciable differences in cce except for the ferric chloride treatment that seemed to promote actinobacteria growth with a 25 increase in cce over the 105 days experiment time frame the relative cce of bacteroidetes showed no significant differences between control 2 and the other soil reactors as shown in fig 5 c p value 0 05 however the bacteroidetes cce increased in the ferric chloride and alum reactors decreased with the remaining treatment and was relatively similar in controls 1 and 2 these results indicate that ferric and alum promoted the growth of this phylum in the soil reactors no significant differences were observed in the relative cce of firmicutes between controls 1 and 2 which indicate that agnps at this concentration had no significant effect on the population of this phylum however as shown in fig 5 d control 1 remained relatively stable with only a slight decrease on day 75 followed by a slight increase while control 2 decreased steadily throughout the experiment the results of the relative cce of firmicutes showed that compared to control 2 the alum reactor had the highest difference p value 0 00023 followed by ferric chloride p value 0 072 the polymer reactor had no significant difference with control 2 p value 0 45 these results suggest that the type of chemicals used in sludge treatment had an impact on the population of this phylum proteobacteria was the only phylum that had significant differences in the relative cce between controls 1 and 2 as shown in fig 5 e indicating an adverse effect of the agnps on the proteobacteria population in the soil however the p value was 0 04 which was only slightly lower than Î± 0 05 and control 1 increased by 5 compared to control 2 which had no increase or decrease the other soil reactors showed no significant differences in proteobacteria cce compared to control 2 however there was a minor decrease of 1 6 in proteobacteria cce in the polymer reactor and slight increases from 1 to 7 in the remaining reactors genomic dna for all soil reactors was analyzed for the presence of the five most common phyla in soil and sludge using qpcr in general the results showed no significant difference in cce for each phylum between controls 1 and 2 at each time point indicating that agnps at this concentration had minimal effect on the presence and diversity of these phyla in the soil reactors over the duration of the experiment some new findings were revealed when the presence and diversity of the five phyla assessed in the other soil reactors were analyzed fig 5 acidobacteria cce continued to increase regardless of the presence of agnps and conditioning chemicals this supports previous studies that have shown that the phylum acidobacteria have the highest tolerance to agnps yang et al 2014 furthermore the change in each phylum over time under different sludge conditioners was not statistically significant p value 0 05 in addition the ferric chloride treatment seemed to promote the growth of all phyla while the polymer treatment reduced phyla growth over time with the exception of acidobacteria this was expected as iron plays a vital role in cell metabolism and polymers exert toxicity and have been shown to enhance the antimicrobial activity of agnps kvitek et al 2008 thus in this case the impact on the soil phyla was more likely due to the type of conditioning chemical rather than the presence of agnps dissolution and release of silver ions ag are believed to be the main cause of agnps toxicity xiu et al 2012 agnps might have reacted with sludge constituents or conditioning chemicals which likely lowered their toxicity several studies showed that sulfidation of agnps during wastewater and sludge treatment produce ag2s which is very stable and less toxic than agnps ma et al 2013 wang et al 2018 agnps toxicity is caused by their very large surface area to volume ratio which enables them to easily penetrate the cell wall react with sulfur and phosphorus containing compounds of dna and lead to cell death toxicity can be reduced by the reaction of agnps with sludge constituents and conditioning chemicals and the resulting change in their chemistry and morphology in addition exposure time is considered an important factor in the toxicity assessment of nanoparticles for example agnps at a concentration range of 0 01 1 mg agnps kg soil did not affect soil biological activities over the short term however after a year of exposure 0 01 mg agnps kg soil the agnps were shown to significantly impact the soil microbial biomass bacterial ammonia oxidizers and the abundance of nitrogen fixing microorganisms grÃ¼n et al 2018 overall the results of the study indicate that land application of biosolids at 20 mg agnps kg soil does not have a significant adverse impact on the soil microorganisms and health it is likely that no significant impact on plants would be observed at these concentrations either a large percentage of agnps dissolved almost immedaitely after addition to sludge and only a small fraction was still in the nanoparticle form sludge conditioners also did not show significant impacts on soil health at the concentrations used it is important to note that the concentrations of agnps and sludge conditioners used in this study were environmentally relevant and realistic concentrations 4 conclusions this study evaluated the fate and removal of agnps during chemical conditioning of sludge with ferric chloride alum and polyacrylamide polymer and their impact on soil bacteria and health after simulated land application of biosolids the study employed environmentally relevant agnps concentrations and used conditioned agnps rather than virgin agnps for simulated land application to provide more realistic representation of what might occur in the field the main findings of this study were ferric chloride alum and synthetic polymers were very effective 99 in removing agnps from the liquid phase and concentrating them in sludge solids the incorporation of nanoparticles and the structure of flocs had different characteristics for each conditioner agnps went through rapid physical chemical and morphological changes in sludge including coating dissolution and agglomeration these changes were not immediately observed in nanopure water a large percentage of agnps dissolved soon after spiking and only one quarter to one third still remained in the nanoparticle form after simulated land application of biosolids agnps at 2 mg agnps g ts sludge corresponding to 20 mg agnps kg soil did not have a significant impact on the soil bacterial population and health as assessed by the five most prevalent phyla acidobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes and proteobacteria hpc and percentage of live cells in soil ferric chloride alum and polymer alone did not show consistent significant impacts on soil bacteria and health either this is the first study to investigate the impact of organic and inorganic conditioners on agnps the study provides insight into the potential impact of agnps and sludge conditioners on the key microorganisms involved in soil biological activities and overall soil health the study also provides a solid basis for further research in the risk assessment

16573,freshwater shortage has been a terrible threat for the sustainable progress and development of human society in 21st century inspired from natural creatures harvesting water from atmosphere has been a feasible and effective method to alleviate water shortage crisis however the recent works related to water collection just focuses on how to optimize fog harvesting manners and efficiencies the safety and availability of collected water are always ignored in this paper we proposed a new strategy accessed to freshwater resources through combining water collection and purification together on eco friendly superwettable material inspired by cactus spines and desert beetles six superhydrophilic wedge shaped patterns prepared by p25 tio2 nanoparticles nps were constructed on candle soot polydimethylsiloxane cs pdms superhydrophobic coating the special superhydrophilic regions not only effectively captured water from foggy environment but generated laplace pressure gradient to faster drive water away the bioinspired material exhibited an efficient water collection rate wcr of 14 9 0 2 mg min 1 cm 2 which was 5 3 and 2 5 times larger than that on uniformed superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic surfaces respectively because of the existence of photocatalytic p25 nps in wetting areas the harvested wastewater containing nine kinds of pesticides 0 5 mg l could be purified in low concentrations 5 under uv light 365 nm 5 0 0 6 mw cm 2 ten zebrafishes were still alive in such purified water for 72 h as a contrast the same number of fishes would almost die in untreated harvested wastewater in just 7 h this work indeed opens up a new sight to freshwater accessibility aiming to a promising project for alleviating water shortage around the world graphical abstract inspired by cactus spines and desert beetles an integrated system for both water collection and purification on superwettable material was developed image graphical abstract keywords freshwater shortage cactus spines desert beetles water collection water purification 1 introduction nowadays plenty of countries and regions experience water shortage xu et al 2019a wang et al 2019 rao et al 2019 lu et al 2019 how to supply sufficient water resource is a significant and perpetual topic various technologies for water access such as desalination zhu et al 2021 ali et al 2017 stein et al

crisis li et al 2018a tang et al 2021 2018b zhu et al 2016a ju et al 2013 since water in air accounts for 10 of the whole freshwater resources in earth in nature there are some creatures cactus ju et al 2012 desert beetles parker and lawrence 2001 spider silk zheng et al 2010 pitcher chen et al 2016 bird beaks prakash et al 2008 ect with fog harvesting abilities for example cactus spines in chihuahua desert are able to spontaneously harvest water and trigger the droplets movement from down to top ju et al 2012 resulting from the gradients of laplace pressure and surface free energy on the special structures namib desert beetles can collect fog to feed themselves attributing to their hydrophobic hydrophilic patterned dorsal backs parker and lawrence 2001 where water is captured on hydrophilic domains and then transported by hydrophobic regions inspired by these amazing natural organisms biomimetic superwetting surfaces have been fabricated with high efficiency water collection in recent years zhu et al 2016b wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 2015 however till to now almost all of the reported fog harvesting materials just emphasize on optimal manners and efficiencies of water collections completely ignoring the quality and utilizability of collected water for example harvesting water from air is often advocated in high humidity regions wooded mountain forest cropland aquafarm ect zheng et al 2010 prakash et al 2008 zhu et al 2016a zhang et al 2017 bighiu et al 2020 nune et al 2016 but pesticides usage which contributes to plant growth permeates the atmosphere in high concentrations threatening safe and available freshwater acquisition szÃ¶cs et al 2017 spilsbury et al 2020 here in we conducted an integration of water collection and purification on the environmental friendly surface inspired by cactus spines and desert beetles where six superhydrophilic triangle patterns were constructed by p25 tio2 nanoparticles nps and candle soot cs mixed with polydimethylsiloxane pdms served as superhydrophobic substrate attributing to strong water capture by wetting p25 nps and self driven force by laplace pressure gradient from wedge shaped patterns the efficient water collection rate wcr of 14 9 0 2 mg min 1 cm 2 was endowed on our surface which was much larger than that of uniformed superhydrophilic wcr 5 2 0 2 mg min 1 cm 2 and superhydrophobic wcr 6 0 0 2 mg min 1 cm 2 samples respectively the wastewater contained 9 kinds of pesticides could be also harvested by our surface meanwhile favorable photodegradations for these organic pollutions were observed due to the photocatalytic p25 nps on superhydrophilic patterns it found that 10 zebrafishes would quickly die in 7 h under such collected wastewater however zebrafishes still stayed alive for as long as 72 h when the pesticides were degraded by our hybrid surface under uv irradiation therefore only ensuring water harvest and purification at the same time can we achieve high quality and safe water from air our eco friendly superwetting material indicates huge potential in industrial application providing reliable water resource in remoted and arid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials copper sheets were purchased from sinopill chemical reagent pdms sylgard 184 was purchased from dow corning company the candles are available online p25 tio2 nps was obtained from degussa all of pesticides are purchased by permission other chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received 2 2 preparation of superwettable surfaces cs was got from the burning candles then cs was evenly mixed with pdms in a series of mass ratios 0 1 1 4 1 1 4 1 8 1 1 0 using acetone as the solvent 6 double side tapes in triangles base 4 mm the top angle is about 20 were adhered on clean copper sheet following by sprat coating cs pdms coating on such surface after the solvent evaporated the tapes were removed on the triangular blank areas a thin layer of hydrophilic glue was firstly applied and then p25 water 0 2 g ml 1 was dropped on the surface to form superhydrophilic patterns so the superhydrophilic superhydrophobic patterned surface was developed 2 3 fog harvesting measurements the prepared sample 3 6 cm2 was fixed on the bracket with its surface perpendicular to the horizontal plane at 25 c a water container was placed under the sample with a distance of 15 cm and the fog generator is 7 cm away from the sample surface a stimulated fog stream about 12 cm s 1 was generated by a commercial humidifier with a fixed relative humidity of 80 the droplets possess the average diameters of 0 2 mm which were blow to the samples fig s1 the water droplets collected by the samples fell into the container below and was weighed every 20 min 2 4 photodegradation test mb and mo water nr ethanol all were in 50 mg l within p25 nps were set in uv light 365 nm 5 0 0 6 mw cm 2 to observe the color variations p25 nps were prepared in degraded solution 1 g 20 ml then 9 kinds of pesticides in different concentrations were firstly mixed in methyl alcohol and then in water with respective concentrations of 0 5 mg l p25 nps from water wetting patterns were added in and then exposed to uv irradiation meanwhile the contents of pesticides were measured every 10 min 2 5 water quality test 10 l of water in three tanks was used before aeration treatment the concentrations of pesticides in 10 l of water were the same as the ones during photocatalysis test which was added in a tank within 10 zebra fishes after the collection and photodegradation another 10 zebra fishes placed in 10 l of pesticides water the last one possessed 10 l of untreated water and 10 zebra fishes then the alive and dead numbers were recorded during a period of 72 h all zebra fishes were 25 days old 2 6 characterizations field emission scanning electron microscope hitachi su8010 was used to characterize the morphology of the samples and dsa100 contact angle analyzer was used to measure water contact angles wcas and rolling off angles ras droplets in 8 Î¼l were dropped on the sample and measured at three different positions to get the average wcas and ras surface chemicals were tested by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab xi thermo fisher scientific the amorphous carbon nps were confirmed by x ray diffraction xrd bruker d8 advance and raman dxr2 xi the

waters usa superoxide and hydroxyl free radicals were tested by paramagnetic resonance spectrometer esr epr bruker a300 where p25 nps were dispersed in ethanol solution for 10 min uv illumination 3 results and discussion 3 1 fabrication of superhydrophilic superhydrophobic patterned materials wettability is mainly decided by textured structure and chemical composition on a surface chen et al 2019 but the commonly used chemicals such as long chain compounds fluorides are harmful to environment and human beings moghadam et al 2021 which are not advocated in real world applications here all of the ingredients are environmentally friendly during the preparation of our bioinspired superwettable surface an eco friendly coating was prepared by cs and pdms with the mass ratio of 8 1 fig s2 the cs with excellent water repellency was obtained from the burning candles deng et al 2012 which combined with hydrophobic pdms to form benign non wetting coating at first six double side sticky tapes in wedge shapes base 4 mm Î± 20 were adhered on copper foil 3 6 cm2 then cs pdms coating was spray coated on such sample subsequently sticky tapes were peeled off at once then adhesive were dripped on blank regions fig s3 which was followed by adding p25 nps on figs 1 a b s4 cs pdms and p25 were proved to be existed on such surface based on xps measurements fig s5 meanwhile amorphous carbon from candles was confirmed by xrd and raman data fig s6 the superhydrophobicity were observed on cs pdms coating with a wca of about 161 5 and ra of about 7 0 which was merited by nano structural cs and low surface energies from cs and pdms fig 1c d the wedge shaped patterns were made up of p25 nps with superhydrophilicity with a wca of nearly 0 fig 1e f so the superhydrophilic superhdrophobic patterned surface was successfully fabricated by the inspirations of desert beetles and cactus spines 3 2 self driven drops by laplace pressure gradient superhydrophilic wedged shaped patterns were embedded on superhydrophobic substrate fig 2 a 8 Î¼l of water droplets from height of 15 cm were dripped on respective wetting and non wetting areas attributing to air occupied on nano structures water drop bounced on water repelled area without any wetting bird et al 2013 pan et al 2018 liu et al 2014 nederbragt et al 2002 but on the superhydrophilic area the dripped water drop could not leave due to strong capillary force therefore on this fog harvesting surface water was captured on superhydrophilic domains while transported on superhydrophobic region what is more due to special shape of superhydrophilic pattern laplace pressure gradient was generated contributing to self driven directional transportation of water droplets here we dripped the same water drops on three parts bottom middle and top shown in figs 2a and s7 of water wetting pattern it found that water droplet above the top part could move for a longest distance of about 3 95 mm fig 2b because of the largest laplace pressure gradient at middle part the transported distance was about 0 81 mm and water drop was nearly firmly adhered without any movement on bottom part due to strong capillary force thus in foggy condition water droplets could be transported from top to bottom on wedge shaped patterns advantaged by this special structure fig 2c 3 3 theoretical analysis of water collection during water collection the unbalanced force f1 was generated because of the different wetting behaviors of the superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic regions fig s8a chaudhury and whitesides 1992 therefore water will be transported from the low surface energy area to the high surface energy region f1 can be expressed as follows 1 f 1 Î³ c o s Î¸ 1 c o s Î¸ 2 Î³is surface tension of water Î¸1 and Î¸2 is the wca on hydrophilic region and hydrophobic region respectively on the superhydrophilic surface the removal of water droplets from superhydrophilic surface is often hindered by capillary force and edge effect fig s9 lee et al 2012 here we generally call the pinning force as f2 2 f 2 Î³ w l 1 c o s Î¸ b c o s Î¸ a when the pinned water droplets extend toward the superhydrophobic region fig s8b the pinning force f3 hydrophobic area is not negligible hong et al 2012 3 f 3 Î³ l 1 c o s Î¸ b c o s Î¸ f 2 Î³ l 2 l1 l2 is the respective contact line length of the water droplet on the hydrophilic

laplace force that causes the water droplets to move from the tip of the triangle to the wide end fig s10 chen et al 2020 the laplace force can be expressed as f4 4 f 4 Î³ 1 r 1 1 r 2 s i n Î± w 2 w 1 v r1 radius of posterior curvature and r2 radius of anterior curvature are the local radius on both ends of water drop and Î³ is the surface tension of water in the hydrophilic region due to the limitation of triangular shape shape of water drop is asymmetric the local radii of curvatures are not equal Î± is the half peak angle of the geometric gradient microchannel w1 and w2 are the half width of narrow and wide ends on geometric gradient pattern v is the volume of water drop the droplet length is about s i n Î± w 2 w 1 the laplace pressure difference on opposite sides of the droplet

droplet increases gradually as a result the water droplets collected in the hydrophilic region will have a resultant force f dorrer and rÃ¼he 2008 zhu et al 2018 5 f mgsin Î² f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 here mg is the gravity of water drop Î² is the inclined angle when the resultant force f is larger than 0 the water droplets will move downward and away from the surface then water is collected by such bioinspired superwettable surface 3 4 water collection measurements five kinds of surfaces with special wettings fig s11 were tested to calculate their water collection rates wcrs in foggy environment fig 3 a compared with water repelled area water droplet transportation was quicker on water wetting pattern due to the self driven force the first removal of water drop took 53 3 s on non wetting area whereas only 47 2 s on superhydrophilic area fig 3b at the same time the size of water drop that firstly departed from such surface were observed which showed the respective diameter of 0 4 0 1 mm and 0 22 0 02 mm on wetting and non wetting areas fig 3c so both quicker water transportation and stronger water capture were found on superhydrophilic wedged shaped patterns from fig 3d water weight per unit area increased linearly upon collecting time demonstrating water collection efficiency is stable on every wetting surface the hydrophilic cu surface and superhydrophilic based surface possessed the low wcr of 5 2 0 1 mg min 1 cm 2 and 2 8 0 1 mg min 1 cm 2 fig 3e respectively arising from the edge effect fig s9 superhydrophobic cs pdms coating surface exhibited a superior wcr of 6 0 0 2 mg min 1 cm 2 because of quick water transportation fig s8b when the tips of the triangular patterns were up in water collection a highest wcr of 14 9 0 2 mg min 1 cm 2 was obtained since the special wedge shaped patterns but once the tips of wetting region turned down a relative low wcr of 7 2 0 3 mg min 1 cm 2 was found because of inverse laplace pressure therefore superhydrophilic superhydrophobic patterned surface showed the best water collection efficiency wcr 14 9 0 2 mg min 1 cm 2 which manifested efficient wcr compared other reported works fig s12 in order to further demonstrate the durability of the surface the uv illumination and sand impact tests were used the wetting behaviors and wcrs almost keep unchanged even after 30 h uv irradiation and 30 repeats of sand impact fig s13 moreover from the uv vis spectra no obvious peak was found on the collected water indicating almost no nanoparticles fragments existed in such collected water fig s14 to simulate the water harvesting manners of stenocara beetles bai et al 2014 wang et al 2016 surface iii and v were inclined as the angles of respective 30 60 90 to measure wcrs fig 3f it found that the highest wcrs were endowed at an inclined angle of 90 in the meantime stable water collecting performances as well as the wetting behaviors were observed on surface v with no obvious variations even for 30 repeated cycles fig s15 3 5 photodegradation on superhydrophilic patterns to demonstrate the purifying performance on the bioinspired surface nine kinds of pesticides i e myclobutanil triadimefon paclobutrazol flutriafol tebuconazole hexaconazole triticonazole metconazole benalaxyl were simulated in wastewater table s1 in such foggy condition fig 4 a our surface also showed high efficiency collection rate of 15 4 0 4 mg min 1 cm 2 fig s16 which kept stable values even for 10 repeats fig s17 however high contents of pesticides were still found in collected water fig 4b which was far away from freshwater usages gratefully because of the existence of p25 nps on superhydrophilic patterns superoxide and hydroxyl free radicals were excited under uv light figs 4c s18 to react with these pesticides on the sample surface fig s19 park 2018 shang et al 2021 so our material showed efficient photodegradation for organic substances the methyl blue mb and orange mo water nile red nr ethanol were successfully degraded by wetting regions under uv illumination fig s20 besides organic dyes the pesticides could be decomposed on our surface for ten repeated cycles as well fig s21 under 1 h uv illumination almost all of pesticides were degraded in low concentrations fig 4d which were less than 5 as the contrast once pesticide solution was set under uv light without p25 nps no degradation was found therefore the collected wastewater could be purified by our hybrid surface attributing to photocatalytic superhydrophilic patterns 3 6 quality test of wastewater after photodegradation water could be harvested and then purified on our reported surface to further demonstrate quality of collected wastewater after photodegradation ten zebra fishes were respectively set in three water tanks pesticides water before degradation fig 5 a pesticides water after degradation fig 5b water fig 5c at the beginning water was treated with aeration for more than 48 h then fishes were put in water tankers to observe their alive states in the environment of pesticide and water without any treatment two fishes died at about 2 h and all of them were dead during a period of about 7 h fig 5d movie s1 so the collected wastewater was still harmful but in the photodegraded wastewater all fishes kept alive for as long as 72 h fig 5e movie s2 when extending to 480 h 20 days all of them were actively alive fig s22 and the fishes also live well in water even for a long time movie s3 as a result only by a system combining water collection and purification the safe and available freshwater could be achieved from nature 4 conclusions in conclusion inspired by cactus spines and desert beetles we conducted a simple flexible low cost pollution free method to develop a water collection and purification system cs pdms coating acted as superhydrophobic substrate and p25 nps in wedged shapes served as superhydrophilic patterns a highest wcr of 14 9 0 2 mg min 1 cm 2 was endowed on the sample with six wedge shaped wetting patterns due to the self driven water by laplace pressure gradient which was 5 3 and 2 5 times higher than that on uniformed superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic surfaces respectively what is more the collected poisonous wastewater could be further decomposed and become safe and available by superhydrophilic areas because of the existence of photocatalytic p25 nps where zebra

16573,freshwater shortage has been a terrible threat for the sustainable progress and development of human society in 21st century inspired from natural creatures harvesting water from atmosphere has been a feasible and effective method to alleviate water shortage crisis however the recent works related to water collection just focuses on how to optimize fog harvesting manners and efficiencies the safety and availability of collected water are always ignored in this paper we proposed a new strategy accessed to freshwater resources through combining water collection and purification together on eco friendly superwettable material inspired by cactus spines and desert beetles six superhydrophilic wedge shaped patterns prepared by p25 tio2 nanoparticles nps were constructed on candle soot polydimethylsiloxane cs pdms superhydrophobic coating the special superhydrophilic regions not only effectively captured water from foggy environment but generated laplace pressure gradient to faster drive water away the bioinspired material exhibited an efficient water collection rate wcr of 14 9 0 2 mg min 1 cm 2 which was 5 3 and 2 5 times larger than that on uniformed superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic surfaces respectively because of the existence of photocatalytic p25 nps in wetting areas the harvested wastewater containing nine kinds of pesticides 0 5 mg l could be purified in low concentrations 5 under uv light 365 nm 5 0 0 6 mw cm 2 ten zebrafishes were still alive in such purified water for 72 h as a contrast the same number of fishes would almost die in untreated harvested wastewater in just 7 h this work indeed opens up a new sight to freshwater accessibility aiming to a promising project for alleviating water shortage around the world graphical abstract inspired by cactus spines and desert beetles an integrated system for both water collection and purification on superwettable material was developed image graphical abstract keywords freshwater shortage cactus spines desert beetles water collection water purification 1 introduction nowadays plenty of countries and regions experience water shortage xu et al 2019a wang et al 2019 rao et al 2019 lu et al 2019 how to supply sufficient water resource is a significant and perpetual topic various technologies for water access such as desalination zhu et al 2021 ali et al 2017 stein et al

crisis li et al 2018a tang et al 2021 2018b zhu et al 2016a ju et al 2013 since water in air accounts for 10 of the whole freshwater resources in earth in nature there are some creatures cactus ju et al 2012 desert beetles parker and lawrence 2001 spider silk zheng et al 2010 pitcher chen et al 2016 bird beaks prakash et al 2008 ect with fog harvesting abilities for example cactus spines in chihuahua desert are able to spontaneously harvest water and trigger the droplets movement from down to top ju et al 2012 resulting from the gradients of laplace pressure and surface free energy on the special structures namib desert beetles can collect fog to feed themselves attributing to their hydrophobic hydrophilic patterned dorsal backs parker and lawrence 2001 where water is captured on hydrophilic domains and then transported by hydrophobic regions inspired by these amazing natural organisms biomimetic superwetting surfaces have been fabricated with high efficiency water collection in recent years zhu et al 2016b wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 2015 however till to now almost all of the reported fog harvesting materials just emphasize on optimal manners and efficiencies of water collections completely ignoring the quality and utilizability of collected water for example harvesting water from air is often advocated in high humidity regions wooded mountain forest cropland aquafarm ect zheng et al 2010 prakash et al 2008 zhu et al 2016a zhang et al 2017 bighiu et al 2020 nune et al 2016 but pesticides usage which contributes to plant growth permeates the atmosphere in high concentrations threatening safe and available freshwater acquisition szÃ¶cs et al 2017 spilsbury et al 2020 here in we conducted an integration of water collection and purification on the environmental friendly surface inspired by cactus spines and desert beetles where six superhydrophilic triangle patterns were constructed by p25 tio2 nanoparticles nps and candle soot cs mixed with polydimethylsiloxane pdms served as superhydrophobic substrate attributing to strong water capture by wetting p25 nps and self driven force by laplace pressure gradient from wedge shaped patterns the efficient water collection rate wcr of 14 9 0 2 mg min 1 cm 2 was endowed on our surface which was much larger than that of uniformed superhydrophilic wcr 5 2 0 2 mg min 1 cm 2 and superhydrophobic wcr 6 0 0 2 mg min 1 cm 2 samples respectively the wastewater contained 9 kinds of pesticides could be also harvested by our surface meanwhile favorable photodegradations for these organic pollutions were observed due to the photocatalytic p25 nps on superhydrophilic patterns it found that 10 zebrafishes would quickly die in 7 h under such collected wastewater however zebrafishes still stayed alive for as long as 72 h when the pesticides were degraded by our hybrid surface under uv irradiation therefore only ensuring water harvest and purification at the same time can we achieve high quality and safe water from air our eco friendly superwetting material indicates huge potential in industrial application providing reliable water resource in remoted and arid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials copper sheets were purchased from sinopill chemical reagent pdms sylgard 184 was purchased from dow corning company the candles are available online p25 tio2 nps was obtained from degussa all of pesticides are purchased by permission other chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received 2 2 preparation of superwettable surfaces cs was got from the burning candles then cs was evenly mixed with pdms in a series of mass ratios 0 1 1 4 1 1 4 1 8 1 1 0 using acetone as the solvent 6 double side tapes in triangles base 4 mm the top angle is about 20 were adhered on clean copper sheet following by sprat coating cs pdms coating on such surface after the solvent evaporated the tapes were removed on the triangular blank areas a thin layer of hydrophilic glue was firstly applied and then p25 water 0 2 g ml 1 was dropped on the surface to form superhydrophilic patterns so the superhydrophilic superhydrophobic patterned surface was developed 2 3 fog harvesting measurements the prepared sample 3 6 cm2 was fixed on the bracket with its surface perpendicular to the horizontal plane at 25 c a water container was placed under the sample with a distance of 15 cm and the fog generator is 7 cm away from the sample surface a stimulated fog stream about 12 cm s 1 was generated by a commercial humidifier with a fixed relative humidity of 80 the droplets possess the average diameters of 0 2 mm which were blow to the samples fig s1 the water droplets collected by the samples fell into the container below and was weighed every 20 min 2 4 photodegradation test mb and mo water nr ethanol all were in 50 mg l within p25 nps were set in uv light 365 nm 5 0 0 6 mw cm 2 to observe the color variations p25 nps were prepared in degraded solution 1 g 20 ml then 9 kinds of pesticides in different concentrations were firstly mixed in methyl alcohol and then in water with respective concentrations of 0 5 mg l p25 nps from water wetting patterns were added in and then exposed to uv irradiation meanwhile the contents of pesticides were measured every 10 min 2 5 water quality test 10 l of water in three tanks was used before aeration treatment the concentrations of pesticides in 10 l of water were the same as the ones during photocatalysis test which was added in a tank within 10 zebra fishes after the collection and photodegradation another 10 zebra fishes placed in 10 l of pesticides water the last one possessed 10 l of untreated water and 10 zebra fishes then the alive and dead numbers were recorded during a period of 72 h all zebra fishes were 25 days old 2 6 characterizations field emission scanning electron microscope hitachi su8010 was used to characterize the morphology of the samples and dsa100 contact angle analyzer was used to measure water contact angles wcas and rolling off angles ras droplets in 8 Î¼l were dropped on the sample and measured at three different positions to get the average wcas and ras surface chemicals were tested by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab xi thermo fisher scientific the amorphous carbon nps were confirmed by x ray diffraction xrd bruker d8 advance and raman dxr2 xi the

waters usa superoxide and hydroxyl free radicals were tested by paramagnetic resonance spectrometer esr epr bruker a300 where p25 nps were dispersed in ethanol solution for 10 min uv illumination 3 results and discussion 3 1 fabrication of superhydrophilic superhydrophobic patterned materials wettability is mainly decided by textured structure and chemical composition on a surface chen et al 2019 but the commonly used chemicals such as long chain compounds fluorides are harmful to environment and human beings moghadam et al 2021 which are not advocated in real world applications here all of the ingredients are environmentally friendly during the preparation of our bioinspired superwettable surface an eco friendly coating was prepared by cs and pdms with the mass ratio of 8 1 fig s2 the cs with excellent water repellency was obtained from the burning candles deng et al 2012 which combined with hydrophobic pdms to form benign non wetting coating at first six double side sticky tapes in wedge shapes base 4 mm Î± 20 were adhered on copper foil 3 6 cm2 then cs pdms coating was spray coated on such sample subsequently sticky tapes were peeled off at once then adhesive were dripped on blank regions fig s3 which was followed by adding p25 nps on figs 1 a b s4 cs pdms and p25 were proved to be existed on such surface based on xps measurements fig s5 meanwhile amorphous carbon from candles was confirmed by xrd and raman data fig s6 the superhydrophobicity were observed on cs pdms coating with a wca of about 161 5 and ra of about 7 0 which was merited by nano structural cs and low surface energies from cs and pdms fig 1c d the wedge shaped patterns were made up of p25 nps with superhydrophilicity with a wca of nearly 0 fig 1e f so the superhydrophilic superhdrophobic patterned surface was successfully fabricated by the inspirations of desert beetles and cactus spines 3 2 self driven drops by laplace pressure gradient superhydrophilic wedged shaped patterns were embedded on superhydrophobic substrate fig 2 a 8 Î¼l of water droplets from height of 15 cm were dripped on respective wetting and non wetting areas attributing to air occupied on nano structures water drop bounced on water repelled area without any wetting bird et al 2013 pan et al 2018 liu et al 2014 nederbragt et al 2002 but on the superhydrophilic area the dripped water drop could not leave due to strong capillary force therefore on this fog harvesting surface water was captured on superhydrophilic domains while transported on superhydrophobic region what is more due to special shape of superhydrophilic pattern laplace pressure gradient was generated contributing to self driven directional transportation of water droplets here we dripped the same water drops on three parts bottom middle and top shown in figs 2a and s7 of water wetting pattern it found that water droplet above the top part could move for a longest distance of about 3 95 mm fig 2b because of the largest laplace pressure gradient at middle part the transported distance was about 0 81 mm and water drop was nearly firmly adhered without any movement on bottom part due to strong capillary force thus in foggy condition water droplets could be transported from top to bottom on wedge shaped patterns advantaged by this special structure fig 2c 3 3 theoretical analysis of water collection during water collection the unbalanced force f1 was generated because of the different wetting behaviors of the superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic regions fig s8a chaudhury and whitesides 1992 therefore

16574,onsite non potable reuse of greywater reduces the energy costs associated with the transport of wastewater and the stress on traditional source waters however greywater contains trace organic contaminants torcs that can be harmful to the aquatic environment when released via irrigation in this work the risk associated with torcs was evaluated for two potential irrigation scenarios the use of untreated greywater and the use of greywater treated via conventional activated sludge risk quotient rq ratios were calculated using the maximum concentration of each compound in the untreated or treated greywater divided by the relevant aquatic predicted no effect concentration the torcs with rqs 0 1 or 1 were classified as moderate and high priority respectively a review of greywater literature showed that a total of 350 compounds have been detected with 132 classified as moderate or high priority in untreated greywater post treatment 44 torcs remained as high priority due to high concentrations in greywater and or poor removal during treatment but only 14 of them were detected in multiple geographic locations the final list of 14 torcs includes plasticizers flame retardants di

methylphenol uv filters benzophenone 3 and octocrylene and pharmaceuticals antibiotics acetaminophen trimethoprim caffeine and triclosan this subset of torcs would be useful surrogates to monitor

toilet flushing or irrigation irrigation is a more viable option due to the low installation requirements in addition the demands from irrigation are significantly higher than those from toilet flushing onsite irrigation comprises an average of 30 total household water use but can be up to 63 in arid regions nasem 2016 greywater reuse while not sufficient to cover all irrigation needs could provide a reduction up to 19 or 6 8 mgal year for a 100 acre medium density residential area in potable water demand nasem 2016 the type of treatment employed for greywater reuse is determined by the regulatory guidelines the scale of the system and economic factors where irrigation water quality guidelines exist they are intended to limit exposure to pathogens and protect human health nasem 2016

review of greywater treatment technologies recommended the use of aerobic mbrs for urban communities neighborhoods to achieve greywater treatment goals de gisi et al 2016 though this is likely to be cost prohibitive for many users as with conventional wastewater treatment the regulatory guidelines and treatment goals for irrigation with greywater do not include maximizing the removal of trace organic contaminants torcs torcs include anthropogenic compounds e g pharmaceuticals pesticides herbicides biocides plasticizers flame retardants and preservatives during wastewater treatment torcs are removed from the aqueous phase through aerobic anaerobic biodegradation sorption and volatilization with biodegradation and sorption being the dominant mechanisms for most compounds tran et al 2018 however due to incomplete removal torcs have been detected throughout the aquatic environment and impart toxicity through various modes of action particular attention is given to compounds that are persistent mutagenic carcinogenic toxic for reproduction endocrine disruptors and those that have the potential to induce antibiotic resistance or contribute to co resistance and cross resistance singer et al 2016 diamanti kandarakis et al 2009 echa 2020 although the risk associated with greywater has been assessed in terms of microbial and torc impact on human health during potable reuse benami et al 2016 etchepar and van der hoek 2015 the potential aquatic health risks associated with the non potable reuse of greywater have not been evaluated the purpose of this work was to determine the torcs potentially of concern for aquatic systems during the reuse of greywater for irrigation this was accomplished by comparing the concentration of torcs present in untreated greywater and treated greywater to their aquatic toxicity thresholds i e predicted no effect concentrations given the wide range of potential treatment trains employed for greywater treated greywater concentrations were predicted assuming cas treatment with aerobic biodegradation and sorption of the compounds that exceeded the aquatic threshold post treatment those detected in only one greywater study were eliminated to remove the bias of specific consumer behaviors or regional practices the overarching goal of this process was to establish the compounds of potential concern for the nearby aquatic environment and those that would be useful to monitor during greywater treatment 2 0 methods 2 1 greywater torcs although torcs can be found in a wide range of personal care products the compounds evaluated in this work were limited to those that have been detected in real greywater in 2015 etchepare and van der hoek reviewed the torcs of concern for human health during potable reuse the greywaters considered in etchepare and van der hoek 2015 were geographically limited to results from sweden denmark and the netherlands eriksson et al 2003 2009 palmquist and hanÃ¦us 2005 2006 andersen et al 2007 hernandez leal et al 2010 revitt et al 2011 since 2011 the presence of torcs in greywater has been evaluated in nine other countries including brisbane australia turner et al 2019

west bank palestine craddock et al 2020 paris france deshayes et al 2017 and chennai india ramprasad and philip 2016 the expanded set of torcs evaluated in butkovskyi et al 2017 were included in this analysis though it evaluated the greywater treatment system sneek the netherlands from hernandez leal et al 2010 2 2 selection criteria several selection criteria were used to narrow down the list of torcs detected in greywater and establish the compounds potentially of concern for non potable greywater reuse a flowchart showing the decision tree can be seen in figure s1 the first selection criteria determined if the compound was detected in a real greywater i e not in personal care products or synthetic lab generated greywaters and the second established that the compound had a published aquatic predicted no effect concentration pnec if the compound was not detected in real greywater or lacked a published pnec it was not considered for further evaluation pnec values derived by government agencies e g us epa environment canada or european chemicals agency echa were favored over those determined in the literature which are typically more conservative next the maximum concentration max of a given torc was compared to its pnec and a risk quotient rq concentration pnec was calculated the rqs determined using the max greywater concentration reflect a scenario in which the greywater received no treatment and was used directly for irrigation after a short term storage period torcs with rqs 1 between 0 1 and 0 99 and 0 1 were considered high priority moderate priority and low priority respectively hernando et al 2006 de souza et al 2009 backhaus and faust 2012 for the torcs with max pnec 0 1 a second rq ratio was calculated the second rq ratio was determined using the predicted effluent concentration pec calculated via the generic cas treatment in stpwin us epa s epi suite the biodegradation value assigned was the one determined via biowin which has been shown to provide good correlations with removal observed during secondary municipal wastewater treatment for most compounds blair et al 2013 schaider et al 2016 this generic cas system was employed to avoid the variability observed between different treatment types and plants e g the removal of salicylic acid ranges from 13 95 for cas and 42 95 for mbrs tran et al 2018 these broad differences have been attributed to operational parameters like temperature ph hydraulic and solids retention time as well as the availability of primary substrates e g ammonium and organic carbon for the co metabolism of torcs microbial diversity and the fraction of organic carbon in the sludge radjenovic et al 2009 tran et al 2018 to ensure that the compounds exceeding pec pnec 0 1 were broadly applicable the compounds detected in only one raw greywater site were removed from consideration given the diversity in locations evaluated by published research 12 countries are represented this last selection criteria removed compounds specific to certain activities or consumption patterns of the greywater system users 3 0 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of torcs in raw greywater torcs have been detected in greywater samples from small communities single building or apartment complexes andersen et al 2007 alfiya et al 2018 song et al 2017 craddock et al 2020 butkovskyi et al 2017 turner et al 2019 individual homes zeng and mitch 2015 gros et al 2017 deshayes et al 2017 and hotels ramprasad and philip 2016 zraunig et al 2019 tombola et al 2019 in this work the list of compounds from etchepare and van der hoek 2015 expanded from 278 to 350 the torcs added by this work include antibiotics pharmaceuticals disinfection byproducts herbicides insecticides pesticides biocides fungicides an insect repellent an artificial sweetener hormones biodegradation metabolites flame retardants surfactants and preservatives table s2 many of these greywater torcs are also detected at high levels in municipal wastewater illustrating the importance of greywater as a source of torcs in centralized or decentralized wastewater treatment plants schaider et al 2017 luo et al 2014 the influent greywater torc concentrations ranged over nine orders of magnitude from pg l to mg l figure s2 grouped by class surfactants were detected at the highest average concentration of 2 4 mg l median 7 8 Î¼g l due to the mg l levels of propylene glycol 9 octadecenoic acid or oleic acid and sodium dodecyl sulfate or sodium lauryl sulfate apart from surfactants three other classes of compounds were anticipated to be present at high levels in greywaters due to their applications in personal care products i e preservatives median 20 Î¼g l uv filters median 17 Î¼g l fragrances and flavors median 1 Î¼g l and biochemicals median 3 Î¼g l lower median values were observed for the pharmaceuticals 0 4 Î¼g l antibiotics 0 16 Î¼g l and biocides 0 64 Î¼g l both topically applied compounds e g acetaminophen and triclosan and compounds used as oral medications were detected zraunig et al 2019 turner et al 2019 gros et al 2017 craddock et al 2020 the presence of oral pharmaceuticals was ascribed to either excretion via urine in the shower or disposal by the sink entry to greywater via laundry effluent is an important pathway for plasticizers e g di n butyl phthalate and butylbenzyl phthalate flame retardants e g organophosphate and brominated and herbicides pesticides insecticides which were detected at median levels of 4 9 Î¼g l 0 01 Î¼g l and 0 032 Î¼g l respectively the release of plasticizers or flame retardants likely occurred via a combination of clothing embedded with these compounds and dust accumulated on the clothing saini et al 2016 in addition to clothing plasticizers also have applications in personal care products and soft plastics leading to higher detections relative to flame retardants saini et al 2016 the presence of the insect repellent n n diethyl meta toluamide deet was expected due to its application to the skin and on clothing turner et al 2019 gros et al 2017 but herbicides and pesticides e g diuron and propoxur that are typically not applied as personal care products have also been also detected these compounds have the potential to adhere to clothing during agricultural application and subsequently be released during washing this pathway in part contributed to the detection of atrazine alachlor and trifluralin in greywater generated by farmers craddock et al 2020 apart from torcs carbonaceous chloroform and dichloromethane and nitrogenous n nitrosamines disinfection byproducts have also been detected in greywater samples median of 0 5 Î¼g l as a result of disinfection during treatment or the use of bleach in the home zeng and mitch 2015 etchepare and van der hoek 2015 previous work with the components of greywater e g laundry bathroom sink and shower waters found that laundry effluents were the primary source of nitrosamine precursors in domestic wastewater zeng and mitch 2015 since the publication of some greywater studies several compounds have been banned regulated or subjected to phase outs for example polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes are banned for production and use in the european union and phased out in the united states though consumer products laced with them are still in use pantelaki and voutsa 2019 similarly bisphenol a has been removed from some consumer products e g water bottles but can be found in clothing sports equipment pipes and food storage containers wang et al 2019 in contrast the phase out of nonylphenol ethoxylates from commercial detergent formulations may have contributed to the non detects of these compounds in the groundwater surrounding homes employing onsite septic tank treatment schaider et al 2016 further complicating the impact of these regulatory changes is that they only affect a subset of the countries where greywater reuse is practiced 3 2 torcs of moderate or high concern in untreated greywater although most regulatory agencies require some level of treatment for greywater select localities allow for the direct use of whole greywater laundry effluent or bath water for watering or subsurface irrigation maimon et al 2010 nasem 2016 during untreated reuse the potential for torcs to impact aquatic or terrestrial organisms is high of the 226 torcs detected in greywater studies with published pnec values 132 compounds are classified as moderate or high priority because they have a rq ratio 0 1 or 1 respectively max pnec of the 132 compounds of concern 98 are classified as high priority representing torcs from each category figure 1 table s3 the average rq ratios are highest for uv filters e g 4 methylbenzylidene camphor followed by flame retardants e g pbdes and plasticizers e g di isobutyl phthalate butylbenzyl phthalate with average rq ratios 50 surfactants represent the largest group of compounds with rq ratios 1 due to the presence of nonylphenol ethoxylates and octylphenol ethoxylates pharmaceuticals e g carbamazepine ranitidine and salbutamol biochemicals e g menthol squalene and Î² sitosterol byproducts e g polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and trichloromethane biocides e g triclocarban and organotin preservatives e g sodium benzoate and fragrances and flavors e g stearyl acetate and hexyl cinnamic aldehyde have average rq ratios 15 with one exception malathion the remaining categories all have average rq ratios 15 e g antibiotics tetracycline and ketoprofen insecticide herbicides e g terbutryn hormones estrone and estradiol solvents e g 3 eicosene phenol and stimulants e g nicotine figure 1 of the moderate and high priority compounds rq 0 1 in untreated greywater only 30 have been detected in more than one study this is due to the significant differences observed in the quality and volume of greywater produced between countries depending on socioeconomic factors and regional practices combined with the limited dataset available for greywater relative to municipal wastewater de gisi et al 2016 once additional studies of greywater are completed a subset of these compounds is likely to be detected and considered of concern for example 1h benzotriazole rq ratio 0 84 was detected in only one study but benzotriazoles have broad consumer applications as corrosion inhibitors pigments herbicides and algicides and are frequently detected in municipal wastewaters shi et al 2019 although compounds with max pnec 0 1 were omitted at this stage several compounds are commonly detected in wastewaters e g antibiotics erythromycin ofloxacin vancomycin and linezolid three organophosphate flame retardants ten per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas pesticides insect repellents deet azoxystrobin dimethyl phthalate progesterone and butylparaben table s4 while these compounds are low risk in untreated greywaters eleven of them tributyltin chrysene anthracene phenanthrene fluoranthene 1 2 dichloroethylene and tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate pfoa pfda pfbs and pfhxs are classified as compounds of very high concern under the european union s registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals regulation reach echa 2020 compounds of very high concern are those that should be phased out when technologically or economically feasible because of their potential harm to human or aquatic health employing onsite non potable reuse of greywater as a part of a strategy to reduce energy and lower water demand has the potential to lower per home energy usage due to decreases in energy for treatment pumping and infrastructure schoen et al 2017 for example two recent life cycle assessments of american cities san francisco and atlanta found that decentralized non potable reuse of greywater has the potential to decrease total treatment household energy and greenhouse gas emissions by 30 50 and 30 respectively kavvada et al 2016 jeong et al 2018 however switching to onsite non potable greywater reuse without treatment could release a wide range of compounds detected at rq ratios 0 1 although disinfection with chlorine or uv is considered sufficient treatment for microbiological safety the presence of torcs will not be mitigated by disinfection alone benami et al 2016 additional treatment steps are necessary to reduce the potentially harmful effects on nearby environments 3 3 torcs of moderate or high concern in treated greywater to evaluate the impact of treatment on greywater quality the list of priority compounds includes only those compounds with a rq ratio 0 1 post cas this process lowers the number of compounds from 132 to 92 the final selection criteria which requires the compound to have been detected in at least two geographic locations reduces the number of moderate priority compounds to 8 and the number of high priority compounds to 14 table 1 figure 2 the final list of high or moderate priority greywater compounds includes di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp tonalide ahtn acetaminophen benzyldimethyldodecyl ammonium chloride bac 12 galaxolide hhcb benzophenone 3 bp 3 sulfamethoxazole bisphenol a trimethoprim triclosan octocrylene triphenyl phosphate tphp caffeine 4 nonylphenol 4 np methylparaben ethylparaben propylparaben atrazine ibuprofen 2 6 di tert butyl 4 methylphenol bht metoprolol and diethyl phthalate dep only a quarter of these compounds are also detected in blackwaters i e sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim acetaminophen caffeine ibuprofen and metoprolol the compounds observed at the highest rq ratios are bisphenol a benzophenone 3 and acetaminophen which remain above 10 post treatment figure 2 both bisphenol a and benzophenone 3 are endocrine disrupting chemicals and another four compounds at rq 1 post treatment could contribute to antibiotic resistance e g biocides and antibiotics table 1 etchepare and van der hoek 2015 also evaluated the risk associated with torcs in greywater but they employed human health benchmarks as their toxicity endpoint for potable reuse the authors removed compounds with a log distribution coefficient logd 3 to account for gac adsorption during potable reuse treatment the logd parameter is a ph adjusted logkow and is positively correlated with gac removal acetaminophen bac 12 related compounds in benzalkonium chloride diethyl phthalate ethylparaben methylparaben propylparaben and caffeine were also highlighted as compounds of concern for potable greywater reuse the final list of high and moderate priority torcs includes compounds with a range of removals during treatment four are poorly removed 25 two have moderate removal 25 to 75 and sixteen are well removed 75 removal of these compounds depended upon their physicochemical properties e g susceptibility to biodegradation and sorption to sludge or particulates to determine if the removals observed here using stpwin are appropriate for these compounds the greywater literature values were compared against the predicted values table 1 published literature with evaluations of torcs in greywater treatment has been limited ramprasad and philip 2016 craddock et al 2020 zraunig et al 2019 song et al 2017 tombola et al 2019 hernandez leal et al 2010 2011a therefore five of the moderate and high priority compounds bht dehp dep tphp and 4 np were instead compared against municipal wastewater removal rates luo et al 2014 Ã¶stman et al 2017 lu et al 2019 gao et al 2016 craddock et al 2020 tracked 15 torcs including sulfamethoxazole atrazine and caffeine through a constructed wetland and an upflow gravel filter into the nearby groundwater caffeine and sulfamethoxazole saw 55 removal though atrazine increased post treatment song et al 2017 used a novel biofilter with plastic media to eliminate propylparaben in greywater this removal was mediated via sorption to the attached biomass and subsequent biodegradation that produced an elimination of 99 for 100 Î¼g l of spiked propylparaben song et al 2017 a constructed wetland with four cascading stages and horizontal sub surface flow was used to treat greywater from a resort hotel zraunig et al 2019 this system saw poor removal 30 for sulfamethoxazole moderate removal for metoprolol 65 and good removal 85 for methyl ethyl and propylparaben triclosan bisphenol a caffeine acetaminophen and ibuprofen zraunig et al 2019 tombola et al 2019 evaluated a low cost sequencing batch biofilm reactor constructed from corrugated wire hose for the removal of pharmaceuticals in greywater this system produced moderate removal for ibuprofen 66 good removal for trimethoprim 97 but negative removal for metoprolol tombola et al 2019 as has been observed in municipal wastewater treatment hernandez leal et al 2010 2011a found that upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor treatment was less effective in removing torcs than an aerobic sequencing batch reactor tran et al 2018 aerobic treatment led to 80 removal for propylparaben octocrylene bp 3 4 nonylphenol triclosan bisphenol a bac 12 and hhcb but slight removal 30 for ahtn hernandez leal 2010 further treatment via a gac adsorber produced effluent with concentrations below the detection limit for bisphenol a triclosan ahtn bp 3 hhcb and 4 nonylphenol hernandez leal et al 2011b despite the variety of treatment trains evaluated in the greywater and municipal wastewater the predicted removals are within the literature values table 1 directly comparing the lowest literature removal and the predicted value 13 of the 22 compounds are within 20 of their lowest literature value figure s3 several compounds saw enhanced removal in literature particularly for those employing multibarrier systems e g constructed wetlands or polishing with gac for example bisphenol a is estimated to be moderately removed by stpwin at 38 during treatment via constructed wetland and an aerobic sequencing batch reactor combined with gac this value rose to an average of 63 and 99 respectively hernandez leal et al 2011b the general agreement between literature values and the predicted values shows that this approach is appropriate to find surrogates for the aquatic toxicity associated with treated greywater 3 3 presence of the treated high and moderate risk torcs in the environment during the irrigation of greywater the risk associated with the torcs is moderated by dilution as well as environmental processes e g biodegradation sorption leaching photochemical degradation and uptake by plants carter et al 2019 miller et al 2016 the biodegradation rates for greywater torcs have the potential to vary by several orders of magnitude depending on the site specific characteristics e g differences in microbial abundance and activity temperature and redox conditions greskowiak et al 2017 the sorption of these compounds within irrigated soils is a function of both the soil characteristics e g organic matter and clay content of the soil and physicochemical properties of the compound e g pka logkow and logkoc in addition irrigation using a treated greywater may alter the soil composition in such a way as to affect the fate of torcs for example treated wastewater has been shown to increase the expected mobility of weakly acidic pharmaceuticals due to soil ph changes borgman and chefetz 2013 and sulfamethoxazole has been shown to have a longer half life in wastewater irrigated soils than expected from unimpacted soil data dalkmann et al 2012 of the 22 high priority greywater torcs assessed in this work only 3 have been detected in groundwaters or surface waters nearby to onsite treatment of greywaters turner et al 2019 negahban azar et al 2012 craddock et al 2020 however other compounds ranked as low or moderate priority torcs were detected for example subsurface irrigation of untreated greywater led to acesulfame caffeine and deet in the associated groundwater nearby surface waters also saw detections of salicylic acid and triclosan but only caffeine max of 110 ng l and deet were directly attributed to the greywater turner et al 2019 greywater treated via constructed wetlands and gravel filters led to frequent detections 67 of caffeine atrazine triclocarban and oxacillin in groundwater impacted by reuse at levels 200 ng l craddock et al 2020 the use of onsite wastewater treatment has also led to detections of the priority greywater torcs in nearby surface water or shallow groundwaters subedi et al 2015 yang et al 2017 schaider et al 2016 2017 gao et al 2019 guyader et al 2018 specifically triclosan sulfamethoxazole tphp ibuprofen bisphenol a bp 3 trimethoprim and caffeine were detected in groundwaters near individual home septic tanks though they were present in 45 of samples and at levels 60 ng l subedi et al 2015 schaider et al 2016 yang et al 2017 when larger scale serving more than 3 000 people onsite systems were evaluated e g domestic wastewater infiltration systems 10 of the greywater torcs highlighted here were detected more frequently 65 up to 100 and at higher median concentrations gao et al 2019 median groundwater detections ranged from 50 ng l for trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole triclosan tphp ahtn metropolol and 150 ng l of hhcb ibuprofen caffeine and bisphenol a detections of bp 3 octocrylene ethylparaben methylparaben and propylparaben were less frequent 40 but occurred at a similar range 50 ng l gao et al 2019 generally surface waters near septic systems had a lower number of compounds and lower frequency of detection than groundwaters but select personal care products e g caffeine bisphenol a methylparaben and bp 3 have been detected subedi et al 2015 guyader et al 2018 in addition to onsite treatment irrigation with greywater or treated wastewater has led to the detection of greywater torcs in the affected soils as well as nearby surface waters or groundwaters due to infiltration overwatering and rainfall events kibuye et al 2019 pedersen et al 2005 negahban azar et al 2012 gibson et al 2010 kinney et al 2006 biel maeso et al 2018 dalkmann et al 2012 a long term five year evaluation of irrigation with untreated greywater resulted in significantly higher concentrations of both triclosan and triclocarban in soil as compared to soils irrigated with potable water though the biocides were not detected beneath the first layer of soil negahban azar et al 2012 biel maeso et al 2018 tracked pharmaceuticals in soils irrigated with reclaimed wastewater and saw concentrations from 2 15 ng g and detections at depths up to 150 cm biel maeso et al 2018 untreated wastewater used for irrigation in tula valley mexico resulted in detections of ibuprofen 4 nonylphenol triclosan and bisphenol a at levels from 0 1 ng g up to 109 ng g dry weight gibson et al 2010 however only carbamazepine was not susceptible to reversible sorption particularly in soils with low organic matter and clay content gibson et al 2010 kinney et al 2006 detected 0 02 0 15 ng g of acetaminophen trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole and caffeine in surface soils and found that select compounds persisted after irrigation with reclaimed wastewater was discontinued kibuye et al 2019 found that groundwater nearby to a site irrigated with treated wastewater had frequent detections of ng l levels of acetaminophen caffeine trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole though the concentrations were two orders of magnitude lower than those detected in the irrigation water runoff from agricultural fields irrigated with treated wastewater contained caffeine ibuprofen and bht though as with groundwater these detections were at low levels pedersen et al 2005 of the moderate and high priority greywater torcs only dehp dep bht bac 12 and 4 nonylphenol were not reported in surface waters or groundwaters nearby to onsite treatment dehp dep bht and 4 nonylphenol compounds have logk ow values 4 while bac 12 is a cationic surfactant table 1 as a result bht and 4 nonylphenol were reported in the soils irrigated with treated wastewater instead of nearby surface waters or groundwaters pedersen et al 2005 gibson et al 2010 using the maximum concentration detected in surface or groundwaters impacted by onsite treatment of greywater or domestic wastewater environmental rq ratios were calculated table 2 in total 12 of the 22 high or moderate priority compounds identified in this work are also found to be of moderate or high priority in environmental waters confirming the validity of this assessment specifically bisphenol a trimethoprim bp 3 octocrylene and ibuprofen were detected at levels above their pnecs the greywater compounds with soil pnec values and those that have been reported in soils irrigated with treated wastewater is limited to bisphenol a pnec soil 240 ng g dry weight triclosan pnec soil 100 ng g dry weight and 4 nonylphenol pnec soil 300 ng g dry weight echa 2020 the maximum soil concentration for triclosan 16 7 ng g dry weight and 4 nonylphenol 109 ng g dry weight led to moderate risk rq ratios of 0 17 and 0 40 respectively echa 2020 gibson et al 2010 the detection of the moderate and high risk greywater torcs at concentrations in groundwater surface water or soils associated with moderate risk to the environment highlights the potential importance of the selected compounds 3 4 antibiotic resistance potential associated with greywater mixtures apart from the toxicity associated with greywater compounds antibiotic resistance is also increased via the co occurrence of antibiotics with metals herbicides and biocides nguyen et al 2019 ramakrishnan et al 2019 cary and mcnamara 2015 singer et al 2016 in this context antibiotics themselves are detected at levels both above e g trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole and below e g vancomycin and erythromycin the pnec values associated with antibiotic resistance bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 however the release of antibiotics in conjunction with the presence of other selective agents has the potential to result in co or cross resistance nguyen et al 2019 ramakrishnan et al 2019 cary and mcnamara 2015 due to the presence of these torcs in domestic wastewater co resistance and cross resistance occur in wastewater effluents as well as their receiving waters and soils nguyen et al 2019 ramakrishnan et al 2019 cary and mcnamara 2015 singer et al 2016 in greywater both herbicides malathion and terbutryn and disinfectants biocides bac 12 triclocarban triclosan are detected at levels above their pnec in untreated and treated greywaters in addition the non potable reuse of greywater leads to increases in metal concentrations in irrigated soils as well as those in nearby surface and groundwaters turner et al 2016 negahban azar et al 2012 specifically levels of as b cr and cu and al as cr cu fe mn and zn exceeded guidelines in soils and groundwaters respectively turner et al 2016 negahban azar et al 2012 environmental resistances to cd and zn are among the most detected which coincides with the metals detected above guideline values in soil and groundwater irrigated with greywater nguyen et al 2019 turner et al 2016 these data show that the co occurrence of metals alongside antibiotics biocides and pesticides herbicides is likely for soils groundwaters and surface waters receiving greywater irrigation potentially leading to an increase in the level of antimicrobial resistance singer et al 2016 again this emphasizes the need to effectively treat selective agents like herbicides and biocides along with antibiotics prior to greywater reuse 3 5 suspected greywater torcs a limitation of this analysis is that the list of compounds detected in real greywaters likely does not reflect the full suite of compounds present therefore another set of compounds were proposed as suspected greywater torcs the suspected greywater torcs were compounds detected in personal care products or those in municipal wastewater whose source is likely to be household greywater this list includes microplastics and an array of pfas and biocides not yet monitored in greywater schultes et al 2018 sun et al 2019 Ã¶stman et al 2017 microplastics have been detected throughout the aquatic environment i e in wastewater treatment plant effluents sun et al 2019 surface waters li et al 2018 and drinking water cox et al 2019 high levels of microplastics have been observed in laundry effluent due to the agitation of clothing during washing particularly from polyester apparel hartline et al 2016 microplastics appear to be well removed during preliminary and primary treatment via surface skimming or settling during grit removal gravity separation and during tertiary treatment via sand filtration and dissolved air floatation however they are still commonly detected in treated wastewater effluents at ranges from 0 447 particles l sun et al 2019 although the exact mode of action for toxicity is still being evaluated they have been shown to harm aquatic species by causing inflammation malnutrition and reproductive changes browne et al 2013 microplastics are also known to contain harmful additives or sorb harmful torcs e g phthalates polybrominated diphenyl ethers polychlorinated biphenyls exposing aquatic species to high levels of these compounds browne et al 2013 greywater evaluations of pfas were limited to c4 c10 perfluorocarboxylic acids pfcas c4 c8 perfluoroalkyl sulfonates and perfluoroalkyl sulfonamides where ng l levels were detected gros et al 2017 however a wide range of other pfas has been detected in cosmetics and sunscreens including fluorotelomer sulfonates and polyfluoroalkyl phosphate mono and diesters schultes et al 2018 fujii et al 2013 both these classes contain compounds that have the potential to be biodegraded or oxidized to pfcas which are persistent and mobile in the aquatic environment as a result septic tank systems have been tied to pfas detections in nearby shallow groundwater wells schaider et al 2016 biocides e g triclosan and bac 12 were highlighted above as potentially hazardous compounds that contribute to antibiotic resistance but other commonly used biocides antifungals have yet to be evaluated in greywater this list includes chlorohexidine quaternary ammonium compounds apart from bac 12 e g hexadecylpyridinium chloride benzethonium chloride hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide didecyldimethylammonium bromide dequalinium chloride and antifungals e g ketoconazole clotrimazole terbinafine fluconazole and econazole and propiconazole these biocides and antifungals have been detected in wastewater plant influents at maximum concentrations of 54 Âµg l and 0 56 Âµg l respectively Ã¶stman et al 2017 as with bac 12 the quaternary ammonium compounds and antifungals saw limited biodegradation and were removed due to their partitioning to the sludge and particulate phase though wastewater effluents still contained tens to hundreds of ng l Ã¶stman et al 2017 4 0 conclusions greywater is a valuable resource that can contribute to lower energy costs and source water needs for communities however it contains a wide range of torcs associated with personal care products pharmaceuticals and herbicides pesticides the compounds found to be of potential concern in this work are those detected in multiple greywater systems around the world with rq ratios 1 post treatment with cas this final list of high priority compounds includes benzophenone 3 acetaminophen bisphenol a bac 12 trimethoprim triclosan octocrylene methylparaben triphenyl phosphate dehp caffeine tonalide 4 np and bht treatment is crucial to reduce the risk associated with non potable greywater reuse untreated greywater has 12 compounds with rq ratios 100 and 32 compounds with rq ratios 10 whereas post treatment the number of compounds with rq ratios 10 is reduced to 16 the greywater treatment systems reviewed in this work particularly those that employed multibarrier treatment approaches e g constructed wetlands and aerobic sequencing batch reactor with gac are more effective against the variety of greywater torcs zraunig et al 2019 hernandez leal et al 2010 2011b with the goal of protecting nearby groundwaters and surface waters minimizing the concentration of torcs prior to greywater reuse

16574,onsite non potable reuse of greywater reduces the energy costs associated with the transport of wastewater and the stress on traditional source waters however greywater contains trace organic contaminants torcs that can be harmful to the aquatic environment when released via irrigation in this work the risk associated with torcs was evaluated for two potential irrigation scenarios the use of untreated greywater and the use of greywater treated via conventional activated sludge risk quotient rq ratios were calculated using the maximum concentration of each compound in the untreated or treated greywater divided by the relevant aquatic predicted no effect concentration the torcs with rqs 0 1 or 1 were classified as moderate and high priority respectively a review of greywater literature showed that a total of 350 compounds have been detected with 132 classified as moderate or high priority in untreated greywater post treatment 44 torcs remained as high priority due to high concentrations in greywater and or poor removal during treatment but only 14 of them were detected in multiple geographic locations the final list of 14 torcs includes plasticizers flame retardants di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate bisphenol a and triphenyl phosphate surfactants preservatives fragrances 4 nonylphenol benzyldimethyl dodecylammonium chloride tonalide methylparaben and 2 6 di tert butyl 4 methylphenol uv filters benzophenone 3 and octocrylene and pharmaceuticals antibiotics acetaminophen trimethoprim caffeine and triclosan this subset of torcs would be useful surrogates to monitor during greywater treatment for irrigation as potential hazards for nearby aquatic environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 0 introduction population growth urbanization droughts and climate change have contributed to the decline in both the quantity and quality of traditional water sources us epa 2017 to meet future water needs many communities have or are planning to incorporate alternative supplies e g potable and non potable reuse desalination and stormwater harvesting in conjunction with the reduction in traditional source water availability communities are also facing the need to reduce costs from infrastructure energy and emissions currently centralized wastewater and drinking water treatment account for approximately 3 4 of the total energy usage in the united states us epa 2013 the bulk of that energy is consumed during the pumping of drinking water and the aeration of wastewater us epa 2013 potential strategies that reduce energy costs and the amount of source water needed to serve a community include water reuse employing water saving appliances e g low flow showers nutrient and energy recovery from wastewater e g biosolids fertilizers and biogas and onsite wastewater treatment kavvada et al 2016 jeong et al 2018 schoen et al 2017 combining two of these strategies onsite treatment and non potable reuse can realize significant energy water and cost reductions greywater i e the water generated from showers bathroom sinks and laundry is favored as the source water for onsite non potable reuse because it comprises 70 of indoor water by volume and contains significantly lower levels of pathogens nutrients and organic matter as compared to blackwater i e effluent from toilets nasem 2016 greywater installations can also include the water from kitchen sinks and dishwashers though these sources are typically excluded due to their potential to contain pathogens and solids from food scraps although onsite non potable reuse can be used for toilet flushing or irrigation irrigation is a more viable option due to the low installation requirements in addition the demands from irrigation are significantly higher than those from toilet flushing onsite irrigation comprises an average of 30 total household water use but can be up to 63 in arid regions nasem 2016 greywater reuse while not sufficient to cover all irrigation needs could provide a reduction up to 19 or 6 8 mgal year for a 100 acre medium density residential area in potable water demand nasem 2016 the type of treatment employed for greywater reuse is determined by the regulatory guidelines the scale of the system and economic factors where irrigation water quality guidelines exist they are intended to limit exposure to pathogens and protect human health nasem 2016

review of greywater treatment technologies recommended the use of aerobic mbrs for urban communities neighborhoods to achieve greywater treatment goals de gisi et al 2016 though this is likely to be cost prohibitive for many users as with conventional wastewater treatment the regulatory guidelines and treatment goals for irrigation with greywater do not include maximizing the removal of trace organic contaminants torcs torcs include anthropogenic compounds e g pharmaceuticals pesticides herbicides biocides plasticizers flame retardants and preservatives during wastewater treatment torcs are removed from the aqueous phase through aerobic anaerobic biodegradation sorption and volatilization with biodegradation and sorption being the dominant mechanisms for most compounds tran et al 2018 however due to incomplete removal torcs have been detected throughout the aquatic environment and impart toxicity through various modes of action particular attention is given to compounds that are persistent mutagenic carcinogenic toxic for reproduction endocrine disruptors and those that have the potential to induce antibiotic resistance or contribute to co resistance and cross resistance singer et al 2016 diamanti kandarakis et al 2009 echa 2020 although the risk associated with greywater has been assessed in terms of microbial and torc impact on human health during potable reuse benami et al 2016 etchepar and van der hoek 2015 the potential aquatic health risks associated with the non potable reuse of greywater have not been evaluated the purpose of this work was to determine the torcs potentially of concern for aquatic systems during the reuse of greywater for irrigation this was accomplished by comparing the concentration of torcs present in untreated greywater and treated greywater to their aquatic toxicity thresholds i e predicted no effect concentrations given the wide range of potential treatment trains employed for greywater treated greywater concentrations were predicted assuming cas treatment with aerobic biodegradation and sorption of the compounds that exceeded the aquatic threshold post treatment those detected in only one greywater study were eliminated to remove the bias of specific consumer behaviors or regional practices the overarching goal of this process was to establish the compounds of potential concern for the nearby aquatic environment and those that would be useful to monitor during greywater treatment 2 0 methods 2 1 greywater torcs although torcs can be found in a wide range of personal care products the compounds evaluated in this work were limited to those that have been detected in real greywater in 2015 etchepare and van der hoek reviewed the torcs of concern for human health during potable reuse the greywaters considered in etchepare and van der hoek 2015 were geographically limited to results from sweden denmark and the netherlands eriksson et al 2003 2009 palmquist and hanÃ¦us 2005 2006 andersen et al 2007 hernandez leal et al 2010 revitt et al 2011 since 2011 the presence of torcs in greywater has been evaluated in nine other countries including brisbane australia turner et al 2019 kumasi ghana dwumfour asare et al 2017 lloret de mar spain tombola et al 2019 zraunig et al 2019 stanford california us zeng and mitch 2015 haifa israel alfiya et al 2018 shanghai china yin et al 2019 west bank palestine craddock et al 2020 paris france deshayes et al 2017 and chennai india ramprasad and philip 2016 the expanded set of torcs evaluated in butkovskyi et al 2017 were included in this analysis though it evaluated the greywater treatment system sneek the netherlands from hernandez leal et al 2010 2 2 selection criteria several selection criteria were used to narrow down the list of torcs detected in greywater and establish the compounds potentially of concern for non potable greywater reuse a flowchart showing the decision tree can be seen in figure s1 the first selection criteria determined if the compound was detected in a real greywater i e not in personal care products or synthetic lab generated greywaters and the second established that the compound had a published aquatic predicted no effect concentration pnec if the compound was not detected in real greywater or lacked a published pnec it was not considered for further evaluation pnec values derived by government agencies e g us epa environment canada or european chemicals agency echa were favored over those determined in the literature which are typically more conservative next the maximum concentration max of a given torc was compared to its pnec and a risk quotient rq concentration pnec was calculated the rqs determined using the max greywater concentration reflect a scenario in which the greywater received no treatment and was used directly for irrigation after a short term storage period torcs with rqs 1 between 0 1 and 0 99 and 0 1 were considered high priority moderate priority and low priority respectively hernando et al 2006 de souza et al 2009 backhaus and faust 2012 for the torcs with max pnec 0 1 a second rq ratio was calculated the second rq ratio was determined using the predicted effluent concentration pec calculated via the generic cas treatment in stpwin us epa s epi suite the biodegradation value assigned was the one determined via biowin which has been shown to provide good correlations with removal observed during secondary municipal wastewater treatment for most compounds blair et al 2013 schaider et al 2016 this generic cas system was employed to avoid the variability observed between different treatment types and plants e g the removal of salicylic acid ranges from 13 95 for cas and 42 95 for mbrs tran et al 2018 these broad differences have been attributed to operational parameters like temperature ph hydraulic and solids retention time as well as the availability of primary substrates e g ammonium and organic carbon for the co metabolism of torcs microbial diversity and the fraction of organic carbon in the sludge radjenovic et al 2009 tran et al 2018 to ensure that the compounds exceeding pec pnec 0 1 were broadly applicable the compounds detected in only one raw greywater site were removed from consideration given the diversity in locations evaluated by published research 12 countries are represented this last selection criteria removed compounds specific to certain activities or consumption patterns of the greywater system users 3 0 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of torcs in raw greywater torcs have been detected in greywater samples from small communities single building or apartment complexes andersen et al 2007 alfiya et al 2018 song et al 2017 craddock et al 2020 butkovskyi et al 2017 turner et al 2019 individual homes zeng and mitch 2015 gros et al 2017 deshayes et al 2017 and hotels ramprasad and philip 2016 zraunig et al 2019 tombola et al 2019 in this work the list of compounds from etchepare and van der hoek 2015 expanded from 278 to 350 the torcs added by this work include antibiotics pharmaceuticals disinfection byproducts herbicides insecticides pesticides biocides fungicides an insect repellent an artificial sweetener hormones biodegradation metabolites flame retardants surfactants and preservatives table s2 many of these greywater torcs are also detected at high levels in municipal wastewater illustrating the importance of greywater as a source of torcs in centralized or decentralized wastewater treatment plants schaider et al 2017 luo et al 2014 the influent greywater torc concentrations ranged over nine orders of magnitude from pg l to mg l figure s2 grouped by class surfactants were detected at the highest average concentration of 2 4 mg l median 7 8 Î¼g l due to the mg l levels of propylene glycol 9 octadecenoic acid or oleic acid and sodium dodecyl sulfate or sodium lauryl sulfate apart from surfactants three other classes of compounds were anticipated to be present at high levels in greywaters due to their applications in personal care products i e preservatives median 20 Î¼g l uv filters median 17 Î¼g l fragrances and flavors median 1 Î¼g l and biochemicals median 3 Î¼g l lower median values were observed for the pharmaceuticals 0 4 Î¼g l antibiotics 0 16 Î¼g l and biocides 0 64 Î¼g l both topically applied compounds e g acetaminophen and triclosan and compounds used as oral medications were detected zraunig et al 2019 turner et al 2019 gros et al 2017 craddock et al 2020 the presence of oral pharmaceuticals was ascribed to either excretion via urine in the shower or disposal by the sink entry to greywater via laundry effluent is an important pathway for plasticizers e g di n butyl phthalate and butylbenzyl phthalate flame retardants e g organophosphate and brominated and herbicides pesticides insecticides which were detected at median levels of 4 9 Î¼g l 0 01 Î¼g l and 0 032 Î¼g l respectively the release of plasticizers or flame retardants likely occurred via a combination of clothing embedded with these compounds and dust accumulated on the clothing saini et al 2016 in addition to clothing plasticizers also have applications in personal care products and soft plastics leading to higher detections relative to flame retardants saini et al 2016 the presence of the insect repellent n n diethyl meta toluamide deet was expected due to its application to the skin and on clothing turner et al 2019 gros et al 2017 but herbicides and pesticides e g diuron and propoxur that are typically not applied as personal care products have also been also detected these compounds have the potential to adhere to clothing during agricultural application and subsequently be released during washing this pathway in part contributed to the detection of atrazine alachlor and trifluralin in greywater generated by farmers craddock et al 2020 apart from torcs carbonaceous chloroform and dichloromethane and nitrogenous n nitrosamines disinfection byproducts have also been detected in greywater samples median of 0 5 Î¼g l as a result of disinfection during treatment or the use of bleach in the home zeng and mitch 2015 etchepare and van der hoek 2015 previous work with the components of greywater e g laundry bathroom sink and shower waters found that laundry effluents were the primary source of nitrosamine precursors in domestic wastewater zeng and mitch 2015 since the publication of some greywater studies several compounds have been banned regulated or subjected to phase outs for example polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes are banned for production and use in the european union and phased out in the united states though consumer products laced with them are still in use pantelaki and voutsa 2019 similarly bisphenol a has been removed from some consumer products e g water bottles but can be found in clothing sports equipment pipes and food storage containers wang et al 2019 in contrast the phase out of nonylphenol ethoxylates from commercial detergent formulations may have contributed to the non detects of these compounds in the groundwater surrounding homes employing onsite septic tank treatment schaider et al 2016 further complicating the impact of these regulatory changes is that they only affect a subset of the countries where greywater reuse is practiced 3 2 torcs of moderate or high concern in untreated greywater although most regulatory agencies require some level of treatment for greywater select localities allow for the direct use of whole greywater laundry effluent or bath water for watering or subsurface irrigation maimon et al 2010 nasem 2016 during untreated reuse the potential for torcs to impact aquatic or terrestrial organisms is high of the 226 torcs detected in greywater studies with published pnec values 132 compounds are classified as moderate or high priority because they have a rq ratio 0 1 or 1 respectively max pnec of the 132 compounds of concern 98 are classified as high priority representing torcs from each category figure 1 table s3 the average rq ratios are highest for uv filters e g 4 methylbenzylidene camphor followed by flame retardants e g pbdes and plasticizers e g di isobutyl phthalate butylbenzyl phthalate with average rq ratios 50 surfactants represent the largest group of compounds with rq ratios 1 due to the presence of nonylphenol ethoxylates and octylphenol ethoxylates pharmaceuticals e g carbamazepine ranitidine and salbutamol biochemicals e g menthol squalene and Î² sitosterol byproducts e g polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and trichloromethane biocides e g triclocarban and organotin preservatives e g sodium benzoate and fragrances and flavors e g stearyl acetate and hexyl cinnamic aldehyde have average rq ratios 15 with one exception malathion the remaining categories all have average rq ratios 15 e g antibiotics tetracycline and ketoprofen insecticide herbicides e g terbutryn hormones estrone and estradiol solvents e g 3 eicosene phenol and stimulants e g nicotine figure 1 of the moderate and high priority compounds rq 0 1 in untreated greywater only 30 have been detected in more than one study this is due to the significant differences observed in the quality and volume of greywater produced between countries depending on socioeconomic factors and regional practices combined with the limited dataset available for greywater relative to municipal wastewater de gisi et al 2016 once additional studies of greywater are completed a subset of these compounds is likely to be detected and considered of concern for example 1h benzotriazole rq ratio 0 84 was detected in only one study but benzotriazoles have broad consumer applications as corrosion inhibitors pigments herbicides and algicides and are frequently detected in municipal wastewaters shi et al 2019 although compounds with max pnec 0 1 were omitted at this stage several compounds are commonly detected in wastewaters e g antibiotics erythromycin ofloxacin vancomycin and linezolid three organophosphate flame retardants ten per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas pesticides insect repellents deet azoxystrobin dimethyl phthalate progesterone and butylparaben table s4 while these compounds are low risk in untreated greywaters eleven of them tributyltin chrysene anthracene phenanthrene fluoranthene 1 2 dichloroethylene and tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate pfoa pfda pfbs and pfhxs are classified as compounds of very high concern under the european union s registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals regulation reach echa 2020 compounds of very high concern are those that should be phased out when technologically or economically feasible because of their potential harm to human or aquatic health employing onsite non potable reuse of greywater as a part of a strategy to reduce energy and lower water demand has the potential to lower per home energy usage due to decreases in energy for treatment pumping and infrastructure schoen et al 2017 for example two recent life cycle assessments of american cities san francisco and atlanta found that decentralized non potable reuse of greywater has the potential to decrease total treatment household energy and greenhouse gas emissions by 30 50 and 30 respectively kavvada et al 2016 jeong et al 2018 however switching to onsite non potable greywater reuse without treatment could release a wide range of compounds detected at rq ratios 0 1 although disinfection with chlorine or uv is considered sufficient treatment for microbiological safety the presence of torcs will not be mitigated by disinfection alone benami et al 2016 additional treatment steps are necessary to reduce the potentially harmful effects on nearby environments 3 3 torcs of moderate or high concern in treated greywater to evaluate the impact of treatment on greywater quality the list of priority compounds includes only those compounds with a rq ratio 0 1 post cas this process lowers the number of compounds from 132 to 92 the final selection criteria which requires the compound to have been detected in at least two geographic locations reduces the number of moderate priority compounds to 8 and the number of high priority compounds to 14 table 1 figure 2 the final list of high or moderate priority greywater compounds includes di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp tonalide ahtn acetaminophen benzyldimethyldodecyl ammonium chloride bac 12 galaxolide hhcb benzophenone 3 bp 3 sulfamethoxazole bisphenol a trimethoprim triclosan octocrylene triphenyl phosphate tphp caffeine 4 nonylphenol 4 np methylparaben ethylparaben propylparaben atrazine ibuprofen 2 6 di tert butyl 4 methylphenol bht metoprolol and diethyl phthalate dep only a quarter of these compounds are also detected in blackwaters i e sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim acetaminophen caffeine ibuprofen and metoprolol the compounds observed at the highest rq ratios are bisphenol a benzophenone 3 and acetaminophen which remain above 10 post treatment figure 2 both bisphenol a and benzophenone 3 are endocrine disrupting chemicals and another four compounds at rq 1 post treatment could contribute to antibiotic resistance e g biocides and antibiotics table 1 etchepare and van der hoek 2015 also evaluated the risk associated with torcs in greywater but they employed human health benchmarks as their toxicity endpoint for potable reuse the authors removed compounds with a log distribution coefficient logd 3 to account for gac adsorption during potable reuse treatment the logd parameter is a ph adjusted logkow and is positively correlated with gac removal acetaminophen bac 12 related compounds in benzalkonium chloride diethyl phthalate ethylparaben methylparaben propylparaben and caffeine were also highlighted as compounds of concern for potable greywater reuse the final list of high and moderate priority torcs includes compounds with a range of removals during treatment four are poorly removed 25 two have moderate removal 25 to 75 and sixteen are well removed 75 removal of these compounds depended upon their physicochemical properties e g susceptibility to biodegradation and sorption to sludge or particulates to determine if the removals observed here using stpwin are appropriate for these compounds the greywater literature values were compared against the predicted values table 1 published literature with evaluations of torcs in greywater treatment has been limited ramprasad and philip 2016 craddock et al 2020 zraunig et al 2019 song et al 2017 tombola et al 2019 hernandez leal et al 2010 2011a therefore five of the moderate and high priority compounds bht dehp dep tphp and 4 np were instead compared against municipal wastewater removal rates luo et al 2014 Ã¶stman et al 2017 lu et al 2019 gao et al 2016 craddock et al 2020 tracked 15 torcs including sulfamethoxazole atrazine and caffeine through a constructed wetland and an upflow gravel filter into the nearby groundwater caffeine and sulfamethoxazole saw 55 removal though atrazine increased post treatment song et al 2017 used a novel biofilter with plastic media to eliminate propylparaben in greywater this removal was mediated via sorption to the attached biomass and subsequent biodegradation that produced an elimination of 99 for 100 Î¼g l of spiked propylparaben song et al 2017 a constructed wetland with four cascading stages and horizontal sub surface flow was used to treat greywater from a resort hotel zraunig et al 2019 this system saw poor removal 30 for sulfamethoxazole moderate removal for metoprolol 65 and good removal 85 for methyl ethyl and propylparaben triclosan bisphenol a caffeine acetaminophen and ibuprofen zraunig et al 2019 tombola et al 2019 evaluated a low cost sequencing batch biofilm reactor constructed from corrugated wire hose for the removal of pharmaceuticals in greywater this system produced moderate removal for ibuprofen 66 good removal for trimethoprim 97 but negative removal for metoprolol tombola et al 2019 as has been observed in municipal wastewater treatment hernandez leal et al 2010 2011a found that upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor treatment was less effective in removing torcs than an aerobic sequencing batch reactor tran et al 2018 aerobic treatment led to 80 removal for propylparaben octocrylene bp 3 4 nonylphenol triclosan bisphenol a bac 12 and hhcb but slight removal 30 for ahtn hernandez leal 2010 further treatment via a gac adsorber produced effluent with concentrations below the detection limit for bisphenol a triclosan ahtn bp 3 hhcb and 4 nonylphenol hernandez leal et al 2011b despite the variety of treatment trains evaluated in the greywater and municipal wastewater the predicted removals are within the literature values table 1 directly comparing the lowest literature removal and the predicted value 13 of the 22 compounds are within 20 of their lowest literature value figure s3 several compounds saw enhanced removal in literature particularly for those employing multibarrier systems e g constructed wetlands or polishing with gac for example bisphenol a is estimated to be moderately removed by stpwin at 38 during treatment via constructed wetland and an aerobic sequencing batch reactor combined with gac this value rose to an average of 63 and 99 respectively hernandez leal et al 2011b the general agreement between literature values and the predicted values shows that this approach is appropriate to find surrogates for the aquatic toxicity associated with treated greywater 3 3 presence of the treated high and moderate risk torcs in the environment during the irrigation of greywater the risk associated with the torcs is moderated by dilution as well as environmental processes e g biodegradation sorption leaching photochemical degradation and uptake by plants carter et al 2019 miller et al 2016 the biodegradation rates for greywater torcs have the potential to vary by several orders of magnitude depending on the site specific characteristics e g differences in microbial abundance and activity temperature and redox conditions greskowiak et al 2017 the sorption of these compounds within irrigated soils is a function of both the soil characteristics e g organic matter and clay content of the soil and physicochemical properties of the compound e g pka logkow and logkoc in addition irrigation using a treated greywater may alter the soil composition in such a way as to affect the fate of torcs for example treated wastewater has been shown to increase the expected mobility of weakly acidic pharmaceuticals due to soil ph changes borgman and chefetz 2013 and sulfamethoxazole has been shown to have a longer half life in wastewater irrigated soils than expected from unimpacted soil data dalkmann et al 2012 of the 22 high priority greywater torcs assessed in this work only 3 have been detected in groundwaters or surface waters nearby to onsite treatment of greywaters turner et al 2019 negahban azar et al 2012 craddock et al 2020 however other compounds ranked as low or moderate priority torcs were detected for example subsurface irrigation of untreated greywater led to acesulfame caffeine and deet in the associated groundwater nearby surface waters also saw detections of salicylic acid and triclosan but only caffeine max of 110 ng l and deet were directly attributed to the greywater turner et al 2019 greywater treated via constructed wetlands and gravel filters led to frequent detections 67 of caffeine atrazine triclocarban and oxacillin in groundwater impacted by reuse at levels 200 ng l craddock et al 2020 the use of onsite wastewater treatment has also led to detections of the priority greywater torcs in nearby surface water or shallow groundwaters subedi et al 2015 yang et al 2017 schaider et al 2016 2017 gao et al 2019 guyader et al 2018 specifically triclosan sulfamethoxazole tphp ibuprofen bisphenol a bp 3 trimethoprim and caffeine were detected in groundwaters near individual home septic tanks though they were present in 45 of samples and at levels 60 ng l subedi et al 2015 schaider et al 2016 yang et al 2017 when larger scale serving more than 3 000 people onsite systems were evaluated e g domestic wastewater infiltration systems 10 of the greywater torcs highlighted here were detected more frequently 65 up to 100 and at higher median concentrations gao et al 2019 median groundwater detections ranged from 50 ng l for trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole triclosan tphp ahtn metropolol and 150 ng l of hhcb ibuprofen caffeine and bisphenol a detections of bp 3 octocrylene ethylparaben methylparaben and propylparaben were less frequent 40 but occurred at a similar range 50 ng l gao et al 2019 generally surface waters near septic systems had a lower number of compounds and lower frequency of detection than groundwaters but select personal care products e g caffeine bisphenol a methylparaben and bp 3 have been detected subedi et al 2015 guyader et al 2018 in addition to onsite treatment irrigation with greywater or treated wastewater has led to the detection of greywater torcs in the affected soils as well as nearby surface waters or groundwaters due to infiltration overwatering and rainfall events kibuye et al 2019 pedersen et al 2005 negahban azar et al 2012 gibson et al 2010 kinney et al 2006 biel maeso et al 2018 dalkmann et al 2012 a long term five year evaluation of irrigation with untreated greywater resulted in significantly higher concentrations of both triclosan and triclocarban in soil as compared to soils irrigated with potable water though the biocides were not detected beneath the first layer of soil negahban azar et al 2012 biel maeso et al 2018 tracked pharmaceuticals in soils irrigated with reclaimed wastewater and saw concentrations from 2 15 ng g and detections at depths up to 150 cm biel maeso et al 2018 untreated wastewater used for irrigation in tula valley mexico resulted in detections of ibuprofen 4 nonylphenol triclosan and bisphenol a at levels from 0 1 ng g up to 109 ng g dry weight gibson et al 2010 however only carbamazepine was not susceptible to reversible sorption particularly in soils with low organic matter and clay content gibson et al 2010 kinney et al 2006 detected 0 02 0 15 ng g of acetaminophen trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole and caffeine in surface soils and found that select compounds persisted after irrigation with reclaimed wastewater was discontinued kibuye et al 2019 found that groundwater nearby to a site irrigated with treated wastewater had frequent detections of ng l levels of acetaminophen caffeine trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole though the concentrations were two orders of magnitude lower than those detected in the irrigation water runoff from agricultural fields irrigated with treated wastewater contained caffeine ibuprofen and bht though as with groundwater these detections were at low levels pedersen et al 2005 of the moderate and high priority greywater torcs only dehp dep bht bac 12 and 4 nonylphenol were not reported in surface waters or groundwaters nearby to onsite treatment dehp dep bht and 4 nonylphenol compounds have logk ow values 4 while bac 12 is a cationic surfactant table 1 as a result bht and 4 nonylphenol were reported in the soils irrigated with treated wastewater instead of nearby surface waters or groundwaters pedersen et al 2005 gibson et al 2010 using the maximum concentration detected in surface or groundwaters impacted by onsite treatment of greywater or domestic wastewater environmental rq ratios were calculated table 2 in total 12 of the 22 high or moderate priority compounds identified in this work are also found to be of moderate or high priority in environmental waters confirming the validity of this assessment specifically bisphenol a trimethoprim bp 3 octocrylene and ibuprofen were detected at levels above their pnecs the greywater compounds with soil pnec values and those that have been reported in soils irrigated with treated wastewater is limited to bisphenol a pnec soil 240 ng g dry weight triclosan pnec soil 100 ng g dry weight and 4 nonylphenol pnec soil 300 ng g dry weight echa 2020 the maximum soil concentration for triclosan 16 7 ng g dry weight and 4 nonylphenol 109 ng g dry weight led to moderate risk rq ratios of 0 17 and 0 40 respectively echa 2020 gibson et al 2010 the detection of the moderate and high risk greywater torcs at concentrations in groundwater surface water or soils associated with moderate risk to the environment highlights the potential importance of the selected compounds 3 4 antibiotic resistance potential associated with greywater mixtures apart from the toxicity associated with greywater compounds antibiotic resistance is also increased via the co occurrence of antibiotics with metals herbicides and biocides nguyen et al 2019 ramakrishnan et al 2019 cary and mcnamara 2015 singer et al 2016 in this context antibiotics themselves are detected at levels both above e g trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole and below e g vancomycin and erythromycin the pnec values associated with antibiotic resistance bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 however the release of antibiotics in conjunction with the presence of other selective agents has the potential to result in co or cross resistance nguyen et al 2019 ramakrishnan et al 2019 cary and mcnamara 2015 due to the presence of these torcs in domestic wastewater co resistance and cross resistance occur in wastewater effluents as well as their receiving waters and soils nguyen et al 2019 ramakrishnan et al 2019 cary and mcnamara 2015 singer et al 2016 in greywater both herbicides malathion and terbutryn and disinfectants biocides bac 12 triclocarban triclosan are detected at levels above their pnec in untreated and treated greywaters in addition the non potable reuse of greywater leads to increases in metal concentrations in irrigated soils as well as those in nearby surface and groundwaters turner et al 2016 negahban azar et al 2012 specifically levels of as b cr and cu and al as cr cu fe mn and zn exceeded guidelines in soils and groundwaters respectively turner et al 2016 negahban azar et al 2012 environmental resistances to cd and zn are among the most detected which coincides with the metals detected above guideline values in soil and groundwater irrigated with greywater nguyen et al 2019 turner et al 2016 these data show that the co occurrence of metals alongside antibiotics biocides and pesticides herbicides is likely for soils groundwaters and surface waters receiving greywater irrigation potentially leading to an increase in the level of antimicrobial resistance singer et al 2016 again this emphasizes the need to effectively treat selective agents like herbicides and biocides along with antibiotics prior to greywater reuse 3 5 suspected greywater torcs a limitation of this analysis is that the list of compounds detected in real greywaters likely does not reflect the full suite of compounds present therefore another set of compounds were proposed as suspected greywater torcs the suspected greywater torcs were compounds detected in personal care products or those in municipal wastewater whose source is likely to be household greywater this list includes microplastics and an array of pfas and biocides not yet monitored in greywater schultes et al 2018 sun et al 2019 Ã¶stman et al 2017 microplastics have been detected throughout the aquatic environment i e in wastewater treatment plant effluents sun et al 2019 surface waters li et al 2018 and drinking water cox et al 2019 high levels of microplastics have been observed in laundry effluent due to the agitation of clothing during washing particularly from polyester apparel hartline et al 2016 microplastics appear to be well removed during preliminary and primary treatment via surface skimming or settling during grit removal gravity separation and during tertiary treatment via sand filtration and dissolved air floatation however they are still commonly detected in treated wastewater effluents at ranges from 0 447 particles l sun et al 2019 although the exact mode of action for toxicity is still being evaluated they have been shown to harm aquatic species by causing inflammation malnutrition and reproductive changes browne et al 2013 microplastics are also known to contain harmful additives or sorb harmful torcs e g phthalates polybrominated diphenyl ethers polychlorinated biphenyls exposing aquatic species to high levels of these compounds browne et al 2013 greywater evaluations of pfas were limited to c4 c10 perfluorocarboxylic acids pfcas c4 c8 perfluoroalkyl sulfonates and perfluoroalkyl sulfonamides where ng l levels were detected gros et al 2017 however a wide range of other pfas has been detected in cosmetics and sunscreens including fluorotelomer sulfonates and polyfluoroalkyl phosphate mono and diesters schultes et al 2018 fujii et al 2013 both these classes contain compounds that have the potential to be biodegraded or oxidized to pfcas which are persistent and mobile in the aquatic environment as a result septic tank systems have been tied to pfas detections in nearby shallow groundwater wells schaider et al 2016 biocides e g triclosan and bac 12 were highlighted above as potentially hazardous compounds that contribute to antibiotic resistance but other commonly used biocides antifungals have yet to be evaluated in greywater this list includes chlorohexidine quaternary ammonium compounds apart from bac 12 e g hexadecylpyridinium chloride benzethonium chloride hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide didecyldimethylammonium bromide dequalinium chloride and antifungals e g ketoconazole clotrimazole terbinafine fluconazole and econazole and propiconazole these biocides and antifungals have been detected in wastewater plant influents at maximum concentrations of 54 Âµg l and 0 56 Âµg l respectively Ã¶stman et al 2017 as with bac 12 the quaternary ammonium compounds and antifungals saw limited biodegradation and were removed due to their partitioning to the sludge and particulate phase though wastewater effluents still contained tens to hundreds of ng l Ã¶stman et al 2017 4 0 conclusions greywater is a valuable resource that can contribute to lower energy costs and source water needs for communities however it contains a wide range of torcs associated with personal care products pharmaceuticals and herbicides pesticides the compounds found to be of potential concern in this work are those detected in multiple greywater systems around the world with rq ratios 1 post treatment with cas this final list of high priority compounds includes benzophenone 3 acetaminophen bisphenol a bac 12 trimethoprim triclosan octocrylene methylparaben triphenyl phosphate dehp caffeine tonalide 4 np and bht treatment is crucial to reduce the risk associated with non potable greywater reuse untreated greywater has 12 compounds with rq ratios 100 and 32 compounds with rq ratios 10 whereas post treatment the number of compounds with rq ratios 10 is reduced to 16 the greywater treatment systems reviewed in this work particularly those that employed multibarrier treatment approaches e g constructed wetlands and aerobic sequencing batch reactor with gac are more effective against the variety of greywater torcs zraunig et al 2019 hernandez leal et al 2010 2011b with the goal of protecting nearby groundwaters and surface waters minimizing the concentration of torcs prior to greywater reuse via irrigation should be considered and the compounds highlighted here reflect a subset of greywater torcs that would be useful to monitor declaration of competing interest the authors declare that
