19975,aquatic pesticide pollution from both agricultural and urban pest control is a concern in many parts of the world making an accurate assessment of pesticide exposure is the starting point to protecting aquatic ecosystems this in turn requires the design of an effective monitoring program monitoring is also essential to evaluate the efficacy of mitigation measures aimed to curb pesticide pollution however empirical evidence for their efficacy can be confounded by additional influencing factors most prominently variable weather conditions this review summarizes the experiences gained from long term 5 years pesticide monitoring studies for detecting trends and provides recommendations for their improvement we reviewed articles published in the scientific literature with a few complements from selected grey literature for a total of 20 studies which fulfill our search criteria overall temporal trends of pesticide use and hydrological conditions were the two most common factors influencing aquatic pesticide pollution eighteen studies demonstrated observable effects to surface water concentrations from changes in pesticide application rates e g use restriction and sixteen studies from interannual variability in hydrological conditions during the application period accounting for seasonal and streamflow related variability in trend analysis is important because the two factors can obscure trends caused by changes in pesticide use or management practices other mitigation measures e g buffer strips were only detectable in four studies where concentrations or loads were reduced by 45 collecting additional agricultural e g pesticide use mitigation measures and environmental e g precipitation stream flow data as well as establishing a baseline before the implementation of mitigation measures have been consistently reported as prerequisites to interpret water quality trends from long term monitoring studies but have rarely been implemented in the past graphical abstract image 1 keywords long term pesticide monitoring concentration trend surface water 1 0 introduction inadvertent pollution from both agricultural and urban pesticide e g herbicides insecticides and fungicides use is known to be a threat to the healthy ecological functioning of aquatic environments in many parts of the world since the chemical revolution of the 1940 s carson 1964

includes sampling and chemical analysis monitoring is also essential to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation measures e g bans and use restrictions installation of buffer strips safe handling procedures drift reduction sprayers integrated pest management aimed to curb pesticide pollution however providing empirical evidence for the efficacy of specific measures or entire mitigation programs is challenging because several characteristics and confounding factors e g variability in weather can strongly influence pollution to surface waters some being unique to pesticides fig 1 therefore statistical analysis of hydrochemical time series is often required for trend detection and to interpret the factors influencing their presence or absence a number of factors differentiate aquatic pesticide pollution patterns from other pollution types e g nutrients which makes them especially challenging for long term monitoring and trend detection for instance pesticides include hundreds of different active ingredients which differ in their chemical properties and thus in their environmental behaviour reaction to specific mitigation measures and ecotoxicity pesticide use patterns which are generally crop and region specific can also change markedly over time due to changing pest pressure and as compounds get banned and replaced by others schreder and dickey 2005 since chemical analyses of pesticides is time consuming and costly the compound diversity inherent to pesticide pollution poses a challenge for developing and maintaining a consistent pesticide monitoring program over time spycher et al 2018 individual pesticides often exhibit seasonal application patterns which are reflected in pronounced seasonality of their concentrations in streams e g adams and thurman 1991 leu et al 2005 leu et al 2010 furthermore pesticide transport to surface water is typically triggered by rainfall events leu et al 2004 doppler et al 2012 or mishandling during dry periods kreuger 1998 which can cause highly variable concentrations peaks of short duration i e a few hours in small catchments from an ecological viewpoint these concentration peaks are of special concern sch√§fer et al 2012 beketov et al 2013 therefore even multi year data series may only contain a limited number of high concentration events that can be used for trend analysis e g lerch et al 2011a the problem of observing a limited number of high concentrations peaks in surface waters is exacerbated by the strong dependence between the coincidence of pesticide application with precipitation events particularly with herbicides leu et al 2004 singer 2005 lerch et al 2011a doppler et al 2012 local pesticide use data i e pesticide type quantity location and timing of application is often not available and has been shown to play a dominant role in determining pesticide losses ryberg and gilliom 2015 furthermore there are pesticides that degrade slowly in and have a strong affinity to soils such as pyrethroids such pesticides have been shown to be mobilized by rain events in seasons proceeding their application which further obscures the identification of seasonal trends delgado moreno et al 2011 budd et al 2020 thus pesticide monitoring in surface waters is challenged by choosing the appropriate sampling strategy to meet both the monitoring objectives and to be able to capture the strong interannual variability in concentrations key aspects in designing the appropriate sampling strategy is choosing the sub sampling frequency and the factor i e time or flow controlling this frequency for composite water samples the time period in which composite samples are formed is also a key design aspect the monitoring data can represent significantly different measured quantities depending on the chosen sampling strategy employed detecting temporal trends from such data is additionally challenged by the large variety of relevant compounds section 2 2 and the need to account for hydrological effects section 2 4 one way of addressing these challenges is by conducting long term monitoring over several growing seasons or years i e 5 years in this review with a consistent sampling scheme long term monitoring can help define the range and interannual variability of aquatic pesticide pollution which provides greater context when comparing pesticide levels from year to year long term monitoring can also help determine the extent that confounding factors affect pesticide transport to surface waters over a range of environmental and agricultural conditions if consistent patterns are observed over a variety of conditions more confidence can be made in statements about observed trends the current scientific literature has studied the issue of detecting trends from water quality time series hirsch et al 2010 ryberg and vecchia 2013 lloyd et al 2014 reviewed statistical techniques used to detect changes in hydrochemistry and provided a conceptual framework for choosing the appropriate statistical analysis method based on the scientific question being addressed and the structure of the data under analysis however to date there is a knowledge gap in how pesticide specific challenges affect long term trend detection and which mitigation measures have consistently demonstrated long term efficacy in such monitoring studies therefore there is a need for a comprehensive review that assembles all the lessons learned from the various long term pesticide monitoring studies throughout the world in order to get the most out of existing monitoring programs and enhance the design of future programs the objectives of this literature review is to answer the following questions how does the studies design address the issue of confounding factors which sampling strategy is appropriate to meet monitoring objectives what are metrics used to describe interannual variability in pesticide pollution levels how do the studies statistically account for confounding factors and make annual values more comparable what factors have been commonly associated with long term aquatic pesticide trends what kind of mitigation measures have been demonstrated to be effective based on the long term monitoring data what are limitations to existing monitoring programs in section 1 1 we start by discussing a theoretical monitoring design aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation measures and suggest ways inferences can be drawn if the monitoring is less than ideal we then provide a general overview of the confounding factors that make interpreting long term aquatic pesticide pollution data difficult and introduce a causal diagram that maps the interconnectivity of these factors fig 1 section 2 0 discusses common methods used in the reviewed literature which includes sampling strategies substance selection for chemical analysis metrics used to describe the interannual variability in pesticide pollution and the statistical treatment of factors affecting pesticide concentrations section 3 0 discusses the specific factors from the reviewed literature observed to affect long term pesticide trends and the limitations of the monitoring design in section 4 0 we conclude with recommendations for future aquatic pesticide monitoring programs in the supporting information we present the methods used for our literature search and provide a table that summarizes the reviewed case studies table s2 1 1 evaluating effectiveness of mitigation measures the effectiveness of a specific mitigation measure can be evaluated by monitoring before i e baseline and after its implementation while simultaneously monitoring a control this is known as a before after control impact baci design which aims to quantify the effect size i e the effectiveness of a mitigation measure and differentiate environmental changes due to some planned intervention from other factors green 1979 downes et al 2002 the before monitoring forms a baseline and should be long enough to establish an envelope of normal behaviour or variability pesticide concentrations in flowing waters tend to exhibit strong seasonality kreuger 1998 therefore sampling should cover the full range of seasons and more than one instance of each season should be sampled this means that baseline sampling would need to span at least two years but ideally three or more depending on the strength of the interannual variability downes et al 2002 a baseline is important for two reasons the first is to form a basis to evaluate whether a significant change has occurred the second reason is that baseline monitoring can indicate whether there is a pre existing trend which may indicate the influence of factors other than the implemented mitigation measure the control impact component refers to the simultaneous monitoring of the site being impacted and a control site that is outside the influence of the impact downes et al 2002 in hydrology the control impact design can be implemented through paired catchment experiments which provide a logical basis to separate to some extent water quality responses from natural or human induced disturbances see neary 2016 for a review national databases on catchment characteristics such as streamcat by the united states environmental protection agency hill et al 2016 can be useful in finding an appropriate control site if similar changes are observed at both the control and impact sites after mitigation then it would be illogical to infer that the changes were due to the mitigation due to the inherent costs and difficulties of conducting a baci design in long term environmental experiments at the catchment scale all long term pesticide studies we reviewed lack one or more of the baci elements i e the before or control thus long term pesticide studies are observational studies by nature which are empirical investigations that monitor and collect data on key status indicators e g in stream concentrations to elucidate trends but lack a baseline or experimental controls rosenbaum 2002 observational studies are potentially useful because they allow us to document progress toward policy goals and can indicate if more action is needed however without a baseline and or an experimental control it can be difficult to isolate for factors contributing to cause and effect relationships for instance peak pesticide concentrations in surface waters often coincide with rainfall events due to the runoff generated from fields of pesticide application leu et al 2004 doppler et al 2012 therefore drier annual weather conditions i e lower frequency and intensity of rainfall events could lead to less runoff resulting in lower pesticide concentrations in surface waters if the coincidence of rainfall events and pesticide application was the only relationship governing the transport of pesticides to surface waters the main cause of pesticide loss reduction would be the prevailing drier weather conditions in this case it would be incorrect to conclude that any mitigation measure implemented during the same time period was effective in the absence of a baci type design runge et al 2019 recommends the use of causal inference methods on observational time series to identify and quantify causal interdependencies of the underlying system such methods often require large high dimensional datasets which makes them less suitable for long term pesticide monitoring programs ryberg et al 2020 provides an example of such an effort by applying structural equation models to infer major causal factors driving long term atrazine and deethylatrazine concentration trends in conterminous u s streams which turned out to be corn acreage moisture supply and tile drainage downes et al 2002 has proposed a less stringent levels of evidence approach that takes into account nine causal criteria in order to lower the inference uncertainty table 1 using the levels of evidence approach provides a practical framework to interpret data from observational studies and can help to elucidate the effectiveness of specific mitigation measures from other factors however it is important to note that none of the criteria by themselves can establish definite causality instead various sorts of correlative evidence can collectively build a robust case to infer causality hill 1965 who was first to formalize these nine types of evidence argued against demanding that any particular criterion be met and that there is no formal way to weigh some criteria more heavily than others 1 2 factors affecting the evaluation of aquatic pesticide pollution accounting for factors that affect aquatic pesticide pollution is important for two reasons the first is to make year to year pesticide pollution levels more comparable the second is to make an accurate evaluation of the effectiveness of specific mitigation measures to better understand the observational case studies in this review see table s2 we explicitly mapped the main factors ignoring minor feedbacks for clarity that affect pesticide concentrations in surface waters with a focus on agricultural pesticide use fig 1 we would expect a causal diagram for non agricultural pesticide use to be similar to fig 1 however the anthropogenic factors such as farming practices and crop types could be replaced by urban pesticide use practices and the farmyard source pathway could be replaced by urban hardscapes and landscapes having this visual tool allows us to evaluate the levels of the evidence table 1 and hypothesize plausible explanations that could explain changes in observed pesticide levels fig 1 divides the factors into two broad categories 1 environmental factors and 2 anthropogenic factors in this context a confounding factor is one that can disguise trends caused by changes in pesticide use or the effect of mitigation measures the main confounding environmental factor that can affect nearly all others is the weather e g precipitation evapotranspiration et temperature and wind the weather can influence which organisms are likely to thrive including both pests and beneficial predators which subsequently affects which pesticide products are applied and their dosage the weather also drives the transport of pesticides from their site of application to surface water larson et al 1998 an anthropogenic factor that influences aquatic pesticide levels is the changing of pesticide use patterns over time this includes the switching of products due to changes in pest pressure also to avoid resistance hawkins et al 2019 or crops furthermore pesticide registration which is the permission granted by authorities to allow the sale pricing and taxation and use of specific products can change the pesticides available on the market this ultimately determines which pesticides will be used and exposed to the environment additionally farmers may adopt mitigation measures against point and diffuse pesticide losses either voluntarily or with monetary compensation agricultural point sources have been frequently found to originate from farmyards neumann et al 2002 measures that target point sources include courses on proper pesticide disposal and handling cleaning of spraying equipment and restrictions on aesthetic farmyard pesticide use kreuger 1998 a common measure to limit diffuse losses are to install buffer strips which are vegetated spray free zones between the fields and waterways designed to reduce pesticide spray drift runoff and erosion inputs into surface waters reichenberger et al 2007 there are two general analysis methods to treat confounding factors in order to reveal potential trends caused by changes in pesticide use or mitigation measures 1 stratification and 2 multivariate regression analysis both methods require confounding factors to be identified and monitored during the study period braga et al 2012 stratification is the process in which subgroups or strata are formed based on the value of the confounder and compared within their respective strata e g years are categorized by their total annual rainfall stratification is useful if there are only one or two confounders and if there are several years of data multivariate regression analysis uses a mathematical model that estimates the associations between a number of independent variables e g river flow seasonal pesticide use and one dependent variable i e pesticide concentration in surface water the drawbacks of regression analysis are that the interpretation of the results may be inaccurate if assumptions of the mathematical models are not satisfied an objective of this review is to see which confounding factors were commonly dealt with and the methods used to account for them this will be discussed further in section 2 4 2 0 methods from case studies 2 1 sampling strategies the choice between sampling strategies depends strongly on the monitoring objectives for the monitoring of aquatic pesticide levels three sampling strategies were common to the reviewed studies 1 grab sampling 2 time proportional sampling and 3 flow proportional sampling bundschuh et al 2014 compared all three sampling strategies and found that occasional grab sampling during periods without rainfall is not a sensible option because it can substantially underestimates the peak pesticide exposure triggered by transport losses across the land water interface time proportional composite sampling strategy is recommended for assessing the ecotoxicological risks because this strategy reflects concentrations levels that aquatic organisms actually experience however time proportional sampling may underestimate the maximum acute exposure because sampling over a constant time interval can cause the sample to be diluted with low flow or baseflow aliquots with little or no pesticides therefore if peak exposures are of concern an event triggered sampling strategy is recommended oelsner et al 2017 flow proportional sampling provides concentrations which can be useful for calculating loads and loss rates if quantity of pesticide application is known however it can be challenging to implement because sampling is driven by unpredictable weather conditions one way of making flow proportional sampling more practical is to conduct time proportional sampling and to weight the composite sample on flow measurements e g daouk et al 2019 the main issue irrespective of the sampling strategy is whether the sampling frequency is high enough to capture the short duration pesticide concentration dynamics which can be less than a few hours in small headwater catchments leu et al 2004 doppler et al 2012 furthermore there are constraints from the cost and labour of chemical analysis therefore samples are usually combined to form a composite sample for chemical analysis how composite samples are formed will depend on the objectives of the pesticide exposure monitoring for instance 14 day composite samples would be adequate to assess chronic exposure however if the objective is to assess acute exposure composite samples would need to be 3 5 days or less spycher et al 2018 a promising alternative to the aforementioned active sampling strategies is the use of passive samplers which require no technical facilities or power supply and can be deployed flexibly both temporarily and spatially bundschuh et al 2014 there are however several shortcomings that confound the level of confidence associated with the data obtained from passive samplers such as the optimal duration of sampler deployment possible influence of seasons and biofouling implications of other non target water quality parameters e g dissolved organic matter nutrients and chemical properties of compounds on their sorption rate mi√®ge et al 2012 for these reasons none of the long term aquatic pesticide studies we reviewed used passive samplers for their monitoring programs nevertheless the use of passive samplers to monitor aquatic pesticide pollution is an area of active research e g moschet et al 2015 lao et al 2016 liao et al 2017 xue et al 2017 curchod et al 2020 all studies focused their sampling over the plant growing season which starts between march may and ends between september october in the northern hemisphere kreuger and nilsson 2001 extended their sampling to the off season months i e october to november and observed substantial pesticide losses in 1992 suggesting that sampling is required in late fall and early winter for a more comprehensive assessment sampling in the off season is especially important in regions where most rainfall events occur in the winter months e g california which can lead to a delay between the time of application and increased concentrations in surface waters wang et al 2017 2 2 limitations of substance selection for chemical analysis a recurring theme from this review is the uncertainty and possible underestimation of the aquatic pesticide exposure because the suite of analytes were limited without a comprehensive chemical analysis over time e g spycher et al 2018 the possibility remains that some unscreened substances may be present in quantities that are harmful to aquatic organisms daouk et al 2019 recommends collecting additional information such as pesticide use i e application and registration to help narrow down target screening and to keep costs manageable luo et al 2018 developed the surface water prioritization swmp model to prioritize the monitoring of specific pesticides and geographic locations by incorporating pesticide use data physicochemical properties aquatic toxicity and watershed morphology additionally improvements in chemical analytics are likely to occur over the course of a long term monitoring program which can potentially lead to different statements about the chemical status of rivers wahlin and grimvall 2008 stenr√∏d 2015 and lindstr√∂m et al 2015 noted that limits of quantification lowered over the course of their studies which can replace pesticides that were once below the detection limit with quantified concentration values in the charmilles catchment the ecotoxicological risk increased as of 2013 after nicosulfuron water quality criteria for chronic exposure 0 0087 Œºg l annex 2 rs 814 201 wpo 1998 was included in the chemical analysis daouk et al 2019 which also suggests that the ecotoxicological risk could have been underestimated prior to its inclusion thus there are two reasons that the chemical status of rivers could change due to improvements in analytical methods first is from finding newly included substances at relevant concentrations that were previously excluded e g nicosulfuron in charmilles daouk et al 2019 second is from the lowering of the limit of detection over time substances that were once below the detection limit could be replaced with quantified albeit low concentrations if the detected substance is toxic at low concentrations such as pyrethroids e g cypermethrin this could increase the quantified risk of exposure to aquatic organisms conversely the exposure risk could be lowered as limits of quantification loq decrease and substances continue to be very low or nondetectable for instance cases that previously replaced values below the loq with half the loq value may now be replaced by actually concentrations that are less than half the loq lowering the exposure risk despite the inappropriateness and criticism of substituting censored pesticide monitoring data it still commonly occurs instead there are more appropriate methods to analyze censored pesticide data for trends e g helsel 2012 therneau 2013 wang et al 2016 lee 2020 furthermore van leeuwen and vermeire 2007 recommends conducting a sensitivity analysis with a range of values between zero and loq instead of replacing concentrations below loqs with a single value in this way improved analytics should result in a smaller range of uncertainty rather than inconsistent results nonetheless pesticides that are currently known to be toxic at concentrations below or around the limit of detection for many analytical methods e g neonicotinoids and pyrethroids boye et al 2019 will drive the need for improved method detection limits and have the potential to play a larger role in future risk assessments additionally some pesticides are difficult to detect analytically for instance glyphosate requires a separate and costly analytical method ib√°√±ez et al 2005 boye et al 2019 for this reason glyphosate is often excluded from the suite of substances being analyzed moschet et al 2014 stone et al 2014 this data gap can lead to the potential underestimation of the exposure risk and will be discussed further in section 3 3 toxic tradeoffs consistent sampling and laboratory practices are critical to the interpretation of long term environmental trends wahlin and grimvall 2008 have found strong evidence that long term trends in measured nutrient concentrations can be more extensively influenced by changes in sampling and laboratory practices than by actual changes in the state of the environment this raises important concerns regarding quality assurances in environmental monitoring and laboratory analysis however it is important to note that consistency should not come at the expense of improvements in basic monitoring design it is of little use for a monitoring program to continue in the same way if it is known to be unfit for purpose therefore downes et al 2002 recommends that the design of new monitoring programs should consider prior experience which is subject to critical review and that improvements in design are favoured over adherence to heuristic traditions 2 3 metrics to describe the interannual variability in pesticide pollution a variety of different metrics and statistical methods have been used by the reviewed studies to evaluate for pesticide trends in surface waters a common approach is to take the measured pesticide concentrations calculate a time weighted annual average value then sum the values for all detected pesticides kreuger and nilsson 2001 hermosin et al 2013 an issue with this approach is that interannual pesticide concentrations can vary considerably over the years often denoted by short term peaks in concentration over the application period and surrounded by frequent low or nondetect values this can skew the mean and underestimate short term acute exposure thus the use of box plots is helpful to depict the interannual distribution i e median upper and lower quartiles 10th and 90th percentiles and outliers of total pesticides in particular several studies schreder and dickey 2005 phillips et al 2007 todd and struger 2014 used box plots to show the interannual variability of pesticide concentrations and a clear reduction in concentrations before and after the ban of specific pesticide products censored values are typically set to any single value lower than the reporting limit with the box plot distribution below the reporting limit blanked out helsel 2012 richards and baker 1993 displayed concentration time series practically through a concentration exceedancy curve cec to plot a cec samples are first sorted by decreasing concentrations allotting a duration of time for each sample for grab samples the time duration allotted to each sample is equal to half the time between it and the preceding sample plus half that between it and the following sample it is important to have a sufficiently short duration of time between samples to create a useful cec plot richards and baker 1993 stated that a majority of their time intervals did not exceed 2 days and that longer intervals 7 days were typically associated with low flow periods with low pesticide concentrations after time allotment concentrations are plotted against cumulative time expressed as a percentage of entire observation period these cumulative frequency plots display the percentage of time a given pesticide exceeds a particular concentration e g environmental quality standard which can be compared annually for concentration exceedance trends annual pesticide loads are another important metric for evaluating water quality trends pesticide loads can be calculated if measurements of flow are taken concurrently with sampling in the small charmilles stream a clear reduction in annual pesticides loads from 2008 to 2013 was observed whereas the interannual concentrations were more erratic due to interannual variability in river discharge daouk et al 2019 this decreasing trend in loads was linked to substantially reduced pesticide wash off after rain events due to the installation of grass strips between vine rows this example shows us how pesticide loads can be a useful metric in evaluating the effectiveness of mitigation measures and that analyzing concentrations alone which showed no clear trends would not have led to the same conclusion additionally the variability in annual pesticide use can be treated by normalizing annual pesticide loads with the total amount of pesticides applied annually this equates to an annual pesticide loss rate comparing annual loss rates is one way to evaluate whether measures other than changing annual pesticide application rates had an effect for instance singer 2005 showed that pesticide losses to lake greifensee in switzerland were mainly related to the coincidence of pesticide application and rain events i e timing quantity and intensity there was no evidence that the implemented pesticide loss reduction measures e g sprayer inspections buffer strips were affecting loss rates which suggests that restricting the quantities of pesticide use was the main mitigation measure that reduced pesticide loads to lake greifensee singer 2005 similarly leu et al 2010 found close relationships between herbicide loss rates and catchment metrics for fast flow during the application periods for six streams in the us and switzerland accurate pesticide use data i e location timing and quantity of specific pesticide application is also critical for the interpretation of monitoring results for patterns and trends but may be difficult to obtain lerch et al 2011a used corn planting progress as a surrogate for the timing of pesticide application which showed promising results when combined with streamflow and degradation rates for predicting atrazine loads schreder and dickey 2005 used annual sales of pesticides as a substitute for pesticide use data using such proxy data can be useful if the area under study is large enough so that statistical downscaling is meaningful or for simple agronomic systems with limited crop diversity i e monocropping where a few herbicides dominate stenr√∏d 2015 extended their analyses by assessing ecotoxicological risk which combines the exposure assessment with an ecological effects assessment van leeuwen and vermeire 2007 an effect assessment estimates the relationship between the exposure level of a substance and the severity of an effect to an organism the effects assessment can be used to establish the threshold of allowable concentrations in the environment e g forming the basis for environmental quality standards since different substances vary in their dose response relationship with differing aquatic organisms a long term aquatic pesticide monitoring program would require the analysis of a large spectrum of pesticides to conduct an accurate ecotoxicological assessment spycher et al 2018 for instance 96 active ingredients and 19 metabolites were analyzed in 6 small norwegian catchments which allowed stenr√∏d 2015 to evaluate water quality trends regarding mixture toxicity to account for this stenr√∏d 2015 calculated a summed monthly relative cumulative risk value or cumulative risk for short cumulative risk is the sum of the ratios between the measured environmental concentration and its environmental quality standard eqs ec 2011 which was based on the most sensitive aquatic test species for the active ingredient of each pesticide from her cumulative risk assessment she observed both a reduction in the detection frequency and concentrations for in stream pesticides in catchments growing heavily sprayed potato and vegetable crops while catchments mainly comprised of cereal production showed no significant reduction in the environmental pesticide loads in general stenr√∏d 2015 concluded that the presence of in stream pesticides can be mainly explained by pesticide use on nearby land areas and the prevailing weather conditions 2 4 treatment of factors affecting pesticide trends most studies included some treatment of factors such as river flow seasonality and or pesticide use when comparing aquatic pesticide pollution levels from year to year as already mentioned singer 2005 accounted for changes in annual pesticide use by calculating and comparing annual loss rates however a few long term studies were observational in nature cerejeira et al 2003 schreder and dickey 2005 meaning that the study mainly focused on observing whether pesticide concentration trends were taking place rather than attempting to determine the precise cause of the trend e g the effectiveness of mitigation measure other than restricting use for those studies explicit treatment of factors was unnecessary several authors accounted for river flow by calculating flow weighted average concentration bodo 1991 richards and baker 1993 lerch et al 2011a 2011b whereas others power et al 1999 phillips et al 2007 todd and struger 2014 noted that no flow adjustment was needed because their analyses showed no correlation between flows and concentrations power et al 1999 found that lindane was an exception and that its concentrations correlated with flow rates in the river thames which they believed were due to its chemical properties several studies treated seasonality in their trend analysis by introducing stratification to nonparametric tests for example bodo 1991 used the seasonal mann kendall test hirsch et al 1982 and phillips et al 2007 used a seasonal step trend analysis helsel and hirsch 1992 seasonal stratification is common in the analyses of pesticide time series because peak concentrations in agricultural settings typically occur seasonally within the spring and summer months when planting and pesticide application particularly herbicides take place see table 2 it should be noted that certain pesticides which degrade slowly in and have a strong affinity to soils e g diazinon fipronil pyrethroids that are applied in regions where rain events dominate in the winter months e g california have shown to be delayed in their transport to surface waters relative to their time of application budd et al 2015 2020 wang et al 2017 this fact does not undermine the importance of evaluating seasonality in the analyses of pesticide time series but highlights the fact that the seasonality of pesticide application and peak surface water concentrations do not always coincide researchers from the usgs created a parametric regression model specifically designed for analysing pesticide concentration trends treating both seasonal and streamflow related variability which they called seawave q vecchia et al 2008 2009 ryberg and gilliom 2015 used seawave q to analyze pesticide trends in major rivers throughout the us from 1992 to 2010 where they found concentration trends mostly agreeing with pesticide use trends sullivan et al 2009 compared seawave q with and without streamflow adjustment to the nonparametric seasonal kendall test seakan by analyzing 10 years of pesticide concentrations in the us corn belt streams they favoured the seawave q method because it required substantially fewer measurements than the flow adjustment procedure for seakan and found that including flow adjustment was an important part of trend analysis because changing flow conditions could alter or disguise trends caused by changes in pesticide use or management practices to the best of our knowledge process based models have yet to be used to evaluate long term pesticide monitoring data a more flexible alternative for treating confounders is the use of process based catchment scale hydrological pesticide transport models such as the one developed by ammann et al 2020 for the ossingen catchment in switzerland such a model could provide process based estimates of pesticide concentrations in surface water it can be used to simulate the situation before and after the implementation of a mitigation measure e g 50 reduction in pesticide use and can therefore be used to simulate the counterfactual assuming that no measures were taken this type of modelling could help fill the gap from missing baseline monitoring by calculating pesticide concentrations using historic meteorological forcings in essence this would be using a conceptual hydrological model for quantitative counterfactual thinking ferraro 2009 which attempts to answer the question does the intervention i e mitigation measure work better than no intervention at all using counterfactual thinking to develop various model scenarios allows one to estimate the expected effect size from introducing mitigation measures and to assess the potential conditions necessary to meet water quality objectives wang et al 2019 proposes to supplement physical and statistical models used to analyze aquatic pesticide pollution data with machine learning methods e g random forests which are tools that can extract important trends from data machine learning methods could be used to conduct meta analyses that compiles data from many different monitoring programs across different regions to identify potential relationships between the fate and transport of pesticides in the aquatic environment the effectiveness of specific mitigation measures and a large number of current and historical factors at the given sites e g land use demographics geomorphological and hydrological attributes machine learning methods have the advantage of relying on few assumptions however they are notably more difficult to interpret rudin 2019 therefore machine learning methods can be used as an initial screening tool to identify the factors that influence aquatic pesticide pollution the most afterwards physical and statistical models can be applied considering these factors to expand upon limited spatial and temporal monitoring data and to gain a better mechanistic understanding of the processes governing aquatic pesticide fate and transport 3 0 factors associated with pesticide trends and limitations of monitoring design several common factors have been associated with long term aquatic pesticide pollution from the reviewed studies table 2 the two most common factors were pesticide application rates 18 studies which includes bans and restricted use of specific products and hydrology 16 studies particularly post application rainfall runoff events fourteen studies have recognized or statistically treated for seasonal patterns in aquatic pesticide pollution which is primarily due to increases in pesticide use during the plant growing season in predominantly agricultural catchments or seasonal pest pressure in predominantly urban catchments ten studies discussed the chemical properties of pesticides e g sorption persistence volatility photolysis to partly explain observed differences in concentration patterns between different substances and why long term trends were detectable for some pesticides and not for others only four studies specifically attributed mitigation measures other than limiting pesticide use to curbing aquatic pesticide pollution a notable exception comes from a study conducted in costa rica carazo rojas et al 2018 where crop growing seasons and pesticide application extend throughout the year in this case pesticide application patterns were not a good predictor of aquatic pesticide concentrations higher pesticide application rates mainly fungicides throughout the rainiest months were associated with lower aquatic pesticide concentrations suggesting a dilution effect tropical environments prove to be an exceptional agro ecosystem where the occurrence of aquatic pesticide pollution may be more related to environmental factors that govern the fate and transport of pesticides e g rainfall events soil properties adsorption runoff leaching and degradation rather than the anthropogenic factor of pesticide application rates furthermore the timing of peak concentrations in surface water may not necessarily coincide with seasonal pesticide application patterns there can be a delay of several months between pesticide application and peak concentrations in regions where rainfall events occur with greater frequency in the winter months e g california this delay is particularly prominent for those pesticides e g diazinon fipronil pyrethroids that degrade slowly in and have a strong affinity to soils budd et al 2015 2020 wang et al 2017 wang et al 2017 found that the diazinon application rates from the preceding year was better at explaining the variance in exceedance frequency compared to the current year s application rates which suggests that the physiochemical properties of diazinon and the prevailing weather conditions in california may cause a significant delay in diazinon transport to surface waters a few other less commonly noted factors shown to be associated with aquatic pesticide pollution include catchment size soil type catchment flashiness population density crop prices and transboundary pesticide sources from neighbouring countries although these factors relate more to spatial differences rather than temporal trends they provide important insights into observed pesticide patterns through inter catchment comparisons richards and baker 1993 observed the tendency for peak observed concentrations to increase as watershed size decreased which they theorized was due to the greater mixing and dilution in larger watersheds that receive water from various tributaries richards and baker 1993 lerch et al 2015 and stenr√∏d 2015 noted that the greater proportion of fine grained soil types in the near surface could lead to less pesticide sorption and more rapid transport to streams similarly leu et al 2010 observed an increasing risk for herbicide losses with the flashiness of the catchment todd and struger 2014 found significant relationships between population density or urban land cover and the concentrations of urban use insecticides in surface water bodo 1991 linked a decline in atrazine concentrations with a drop in corn prices illustrating a direct connection between economics crop selection and pesticides use or non use vryzas et al 2009 found evidence of transboundary aquatic pesticide pollution sources in three greek rivers that border bulgaria which suggested the clandestine use of banned substances i e ddt and Œ≥ hch by their neighbour 3 1 identifying urban pesticide sources understanding the main source and pathways of aquatic pesticide pollution can help with the development of targeted mitigation measures a major source of pesticide pollution to surface water comes from agricultural pesticide use however a few long term studies also highlight the importance of urban pesticide use as a source phillips et al 2007 ryberg et al 2010 todd and struger 2014 budd et al 2020 specific pesticides that are registered for non agricultural use can be particularly useful as tracers to identify urban pesticide sources for instance todd and struger 2014 used the ratio of the active ingredients in products sold for urban use and compared them to the observed concentration ratios in streams and found them to be somewhat similar suggesting an urban source in catchments with both agricultural and nonagricultural pesticide use ryberg and gilliom 2015 found that concentration trends could be explained by a combination of agricultural use trends and concentration trends in urban streams it is important to note that long term aquatic pesticide monitoring programs may be inadequate for the purpose of identifying pesticide sources because they typically lack the high frequency temporal resolution necessary for the analysis of source dynamics e g peter et al 2020 3 2 effective mitigation measures a majority of the long term studies we reviewed attributed a reduction in pesticide use including bans or use restrictions as the main factor linked to reductions in aquatic pesticide concentrations table 2 restricting or banning the use of a pesticide is a particularly powerful mitigation measure that directly affects the quantity of that pesticide available for transport to surface waters however the benefits of an outright ban can be obscured if the pesticide is simply replaced by another section 3 3 or if it can persist in groundwater which can be a long term source of pesticides to surface waters even decades after a ban t√∂rnquist et al 2007 larsson et al 2014 furthermore the effectiveness of pesticide use restrictions can be unclear because the quantity of pesticides that are ultimately applied is influenced by a number of other factors such as pest pressure and weather conditions the moderate effects of potentially effective mitigation measures other than use restrictions were often indistinguishable against the background of interannual variability in surface water concentrations nonetheless numerous short term i e 3 years studies have shown that specific mitigation strategies e g grassed buffer strips spray drift reduction better handling practices are effective to varying degrees at reducing pesticide losses to surface water reichenberger et al 2007 although a decrease in pesticide pollution is expected after bans or policies on restricted use there are a number of cases where declining trends in pesticide concentrations were observed before such measures were put into place e g power et al 1999 philipps et al 2007 todd and struger 2014 the presence of a decreasing trend before a ban puts into question their effectiveness and indicates the presence of other factors that could be contributing to a decreasing trend it also emphasizes the importance of sampling before the implementation of mitigation measures in order to establish a baseline todd and struger 2014 speculated that the decreasing trend before the ban could be related to increased public awareness due to bans in neighbouring provinces that potentially led to voluntary reductions in pesticide use similarly wang et al 2017 concluded that a downward diazinon use trend from 1994 to 1998 which occurred before introducing regulatory stimulus could have resulted from changing pest pressures economy or market forces only one study by singer 2005 specified a water quality objective to be met through the implementation of mitigation measures which was to reduce pesticide loads in lake greifensee switzerland by 50 from 1993 to 2003 all other studies did not state meeting specific water quality objectives singer 2005 analyzed pesticide loads within lake greifensee from 1993 to 2003 concluding that none of the mitigation measures e g 3 m wide buffer strips along water courses regulated crop rotation field sprayer inspections soil erosion measures except restrictions on the allowable quantity of pesticide use led to detectable trends in load reduction this is consistent with lerch et al 2011b who concluded that best management practices i e grassed waterways conservation reserve programs terraces implemented in the goodwater creek catchment from 1992 to 2006 were either ineffective and or insufficient in their areal extent to achieve meaningful reductions in herbicide transport there are currently no long term studies that have attributed buffers to reducing long term aquatic pesticide pollution however this does not mean that they are ineffective since there are numerous studies that have demonstrated their short term efficacy reichenberger et al 2007 in the charmilles stream annual pesticide loads decreased by 60 5 2 2 1 kg year between 2008 and 2015 daouk et al 2019 this decrease in loads was linked to the installation of grass strips between vine rows in 2009 2010 which appeared to have reduced peak flows following rain events however daouk et al 2019 concluded that establishing precise quantitative relationships between specific mitigation measures and observations was difficult because several measures e g washing stations better storage were implemented simultaneously by varying degrees in addition to other confounding factors e g interannual variability in precipitation in the vemmenh√∂g catchment sweden numerous mitigation measures were implemented to reduce aquatic pesticide pollution in late 1994 and from 1997 to 1999 kreuger and nilsson 2001 in late 1994 a meeting was held with farmers where information was shared on sources of pesticide contamination reduction strategies and safe pesticide use afterwards free anonymous consultations were offered to farmers where they were given site specific advice such as safe storage of pesticides best practices for filling and cleaning of sprayers and appropriate parking grounds for sprayers additionally restricting aesthetic herbicide spraying on farmyards and other areas with low organic matter was discussed these initial measures reduced annual average pesticide concentrations by about 65 which kreuger 1998 suggests may be mainly attributed to the reducing farmyard point sources and aesthetic herbicide use in 1997 new legislation was introduced requiring spray free buffer zones and compulsory record keeping of pesticide applications from 1998 to 1999 a program was introduced that provided small and mid sized farmers economical compensation over a 5 year period for complying to risk reduction measures such as spray free buffer zones safe filling and cleaning areas e g biobeds sprayer inspections licensing and training courses which contributed to an additional 25 reduction in total annual average pesticide concentrations combined these mitigation measures resulted in a 90 cumulative reduction of total annual average pesticide concentrations in surface water between 1992 and 2000 kreuger and nilsson 2001 hermosin et al 2013 associated a decreasing trend in mean herbicide levels from 2002 to 2010 in the guadalquivir river of southern spain to regulations changes in authorized products and actions courses and technical workshops on pesticide management practices surface water concentrations of diuron decreased by 99 2 36 Œºg l to 0 3 Œºg l from 2003 to 2010 and terbuthylazine decreased by 78 0 89 Œºg l to 0 20 Œºg l from 2008 to 2010 although substantial decreases were observed it is unclear what the relative contribution of regulations and actions were to this decrease similarly budd et al 2020 attributed a decreasing trend in aquatic bifenthrin concentrations from 2008 to 2018 in northern california to the adoption of regulations and licensing applied to professional pest control operators that limited their application of pyrethroids to structures the simultaneous implementation of several mitigation measures is common to national action plans aimed at curbing aquatic pesticide pollution along with the implementation of measures is the surface water monitoring program to gauge the progress towards water quality objectives such monitoring programs are not designed to evaluate the effectiveness of individual measures instead the evaluation of individual mitigation measures would require an experimental approach such as the baci design downes et al 2002 nonetheless these four studies kreuger and nilsson 2001 hermosin et al 2013 daouk et al 2019 budd et al 2020 demonstrated that mitigation measures other than pesticide use restrictions have the potential to produce detectable long term reductions in pesticide concentrations or loads in all four studies a reduction of greater than 45 led to conclusions that the implemented mitigation measures were the causal criteria thus relying on the strength of association and temporality within the levels of evidence approach table 1 3 3 toxic tradeoffs toxic tradeoffs refers to the scenario where banned or restricted pesticides are replaced by others which may not necessarily lead to improvements to the aquatic environment for instance power et al 1999 observed declining atrazine herbicide concentrations in the thames estuary between 1988 and 1997 after atrazine was placed on the uk red list i e banned in august 1993 atrazine concentrations continued to decrease significantly while the concentrations of simazine stabilized and showed no further declines from 1994 to 1997 this suggests that the atrazine ban led to the increased use of simazine as a substitute therefore there may have been little improvement to the cumulative toxicity in the thames estuary after the atrazine ban because simazine has similar toxic effects to atrazine cheremisinoff and rosenfeld 2010 similarly the net effect on aquatic organisms may not necessarily improve if a banned pesticide is replaced with one that is more toxic to aquatic organisms for example in the charmilles catchment several substances replaced atrazine after its ban in 2012 one of which was nicosulfuron nicosulfuron requires lower application rates compared to atrazine because of its greater effectiveness however it has an eqs value approximately 100 times lower than atrazine and can contribute significantly to the overall ecotoxicological risk daouk et al 2019 furthermore substitution of one pesticide with another may lead to an increase in surface water concentrations due to its differing chemical properties e g sorption degradation half lives for instance richards and baker 1993 attributed a higher time weighted mean concentration for atrazine compared to alachlor due to its greater mobility and relative half life therefore the dosage ecotoxicity and chemical properties are critical factors to include when assessing the replacement of one pesticide with another another example of a toxic tradeoff occurred in the us after the federally mandated phaseout of insecticides diazinon and chlorpyrifos in 2001 schreder and dicky 2005 phillips et al 2007 ryberg et al 2010 following the 2001 phaseout schreder and dickey 2005 observed a significant increase of the carbaryl concentrations in two northwestern us creeks phillips et al 2007 extended the analysis to 20 sites throughout the us and did not detect significant changes in carbaryl concentrations in the northeastern and midwestern us in response to the phaseout from 2000 to 2008 ryberg et al 2010 found that trends for carbaryl were mostly nonsignificant and mixed upward and downward in a few locations and instead detected significant upward trends for fipronil and its degradation products throughout the us indicating that fipronil was the more popular substitute for organophosphate insecticides during that period three conclusions come from synthesizing the findings from these studies firstly the toxic tradeoff schreder and dicky 2005 observed seemed to be localized to the northwestern us and not generalizable across the entire us indicating a strong spatial preference for the use of specific pesticide products and the importance of site selection in the design of monitoring programs secondly analysis of different overlapping time periods can result in very different trends this is illustrated by comparing the significant carbaryl upward trend in thornton creek from 1996 to 2003 schreder and dicky 2005 followed by a downward trend from 2000 to 2008 ryberg et al 2010 significant downward trends were observed when the intervention e g pesticide ban or mitigation measure occurred within the time period as opposed to the beginning of the time period which indicates the importance of including a baseline in the trend analysis finally greater evidence indicated that fipronil was a more widespread substitute than carbaryl throughout the us from 2000 to 2008 which would have been missed from only analyzing diazinon chlorpyrifos and carbaryl this stresses the importance of having a sufficient selection of substances for chemical analysis so that accurate statements can be made regarding national scale water quality trends besides explicitly measured toxic tradeoffs there can also be hidden toxic tradeoffs due to limited sampling and chemical analytics with any kind of substitution the important aspect for monitoring is that the substitute is also analyzed otherwise there might only be an apparent improvement in water quality for instance kreuger and nilsson 2001 noted that glyphosate use doubled in the vemmenh√∂g catchment after the implementation of mitigation measures in 1994 however glyphosate concentrations were not reflected in the monitoring results from 1992 to 2000 therefore the apparent improvement to water quality in their study may have been less if glyphosate was analyzed another hidden toxic tradeoff is if banned pesticides are replaced by others that preferentially enter other parts of the environment e g atmosphere groundwater sediments that can evade detection if unmonitored although our review focuses on pesticides in surface water it is important to mention general pesticide pollution here because hidden toxic tradeoffs can be a total environmental issue for instance the herbicide prosulfocarb is a popular substitute for triazine herbicides devault et al 2019 in vavihill sweden kreuger and lindstr√∂m 2019 detected prosulfocarb at high frequencies in precipitation 55 of samples from 2012 to 2015 and high quantities of atmospheric deposition 70 Œºg m2 year from 2012 to 2015 prosulfocarb has the tendency to contaminate areas surrounding the targeted application due to its volatilization potential followed by vapour drift there have been reports in denmark and france of non targeted produce e g autumn apples that exceeded maximum prosulfocarb residue limits which makes it a potential human health hazard devault et al 2019 thus this type of hidden toxic tradeoff can lead to the appearance of improved surface water quality at the detriment of other environmental compartments which would be concealed unless monitored 4 0 conclusions the importance of collecting accurate pesticide use data has been unanimous in all the reviewed studies data on pesticide use includes the location timing and quantity of the specific pesticide products used such data can indicate which substances to include in the chemical analysis and reduce the uncertainty when interpreting monitoring results for aquatic pesticide trends although there is a need to have a standard set of analytes for chemical analyses to make results more comparable from year to year there is also a need to make updates as pesticide use changes to guard against potential toxic tradeoffs in many cases accurate pesticide use data cannot be obtained which has led to the use of proxies such as crop planting progress lerch et al 2011a and pesticide sales schreder and dickey 2005 collecting data on the implementation of mitigation measures is also critical to evaluate their overall effectiveness this includes the timing spatial extent and magnitude of the specific measures that were implemented however this data can also be difficult to obtain several studies have collected such data and were able to demonstrate long term reductions in aquatic pesticide pollution from mitigation measures kreuger and nilsson 2001 hermosin et al 2013 daouk et al 2019 budd et al 2020 it may however be difficult to separate the effects from an individual mitigation measure since several were implemented simultaneously when it comes to choosing the appropriate sampling method for surface water we emphasize the need to sample at a high enough frequency to capture the short duration concentration dynamics typical of streams in headwater catchments this can be met by either a time or flow proportional sampling strategy where the former is better at providing long term exposure patterns relevant to organisms and the latter has the benefit of being able to derive loads and potentially loss rates if quantity of pesticide application is known it is also important to consider the periods in which subsamples are mixed to form composite samples 14 day composites are suitable to assess water quality objectives for chronic exposure however composite samples would need to be 3 5 day or less to assess for acute exposure additional sampling of other environmental compartments e g atmosphere and groundwater and the periodic analysis of highly used but costly to analyze substances e g glyphosate could potentially identify some hidden toxic tradeoffs statistical analysis of long term pesticide trends in surface water should account for seasonality and make some adjustment for streamflow either through stratification e g seasonal mann kendall test hirsch et al 1982 or a multivariate regression analysis e g seawave q vecchia et al 2009 because these two factors can obscure trends caused by changes in pesticide use or management practices long term monitoring studies consistently show that reducing aquatic pesticide pollution can be linked to the ban or restricted use of specific pesticide products however several studies have observed the presence of a decreasing trend prior to a ban which indicates the presence of other influencing factors and the importance of baseline sampling to identify pre existing trends nonetheless updating and enforcing pesticide registration as the science of pesticides

19975,aquatic pesticide pollution from both agricultural and urban pest control is a concern in many parts of the world making an accurate assessment of pesticide exposure is the starting point to protecting aquatic ecosystems this in turn requires the design of an effective monitoring program monitoring is also essential to evaluate the efficacy of mitigation measures aimed to curb pesticide pollution however empirical evidence for their efficacy can be confounded by additional influencing factors most prominently variable weather conditions this review summarizes the experiences gained from long term 5 years pesticide monitoring studies for detecting trends and provides recommendations for their improvement we reviewed articles published in the scientific literature with a few complements from selected grey literature for a total of 20 studies which fulfill our search criteria overall temporal trends of pesticide use and hydrological conditions were the two most common factors influencing aquatic pesticide pollution eighteen studies demonstrated observable effects to surface water concentrations from changes in pesticide application rates e g use restriction and sixteen studies from interannual variability in hydrological conditions during the application period accounting for seasonal and streamflow related variability in trend analysis is important because the two factors can obscure trends caused by changes in pesticide use or management practices other mitigation measures e g buffer strips were only detectable in four studies where concentrations or loads were reduced by 45 collecting additional agricultural e g pesticide use mitigation measures and environmental e g precipitation stream flow data as well as establishing a baseline before the implementation of mitigation measures have been consistently reported as prerequisites to interpret water quality trends from long term monitoring studies but have rarely been implemented in the past graphical abstract image 1 keywords long term pesticide monitoring concentration trend surface water 1 0 introduction inadvertent pollution from both agricultural and urban pesticide e g herbicides insecticides and fungicides use is known to be a threat to the healthy ecological functioning of aquatic environments in many parts of the world since the chemical revolution of the 1940 s carson 1964

includes sampling and chemical analysis monitoring is also essential to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation measures e g bans and use restrictions installation of buffer strips safe handling procedures drift reduction sprayers integrated pest management aimed to curb pesticide pollution however providing empirical evidence for the efficacy of specific measures or entire mitigation programs is challenging because several characteristics and confounding factors e g variability in weather can strongly influence pollution to surface waters some being unique to pesticides fig 1 therefore statistical analysis of hydrochemical time series is often required for trend detection and to interpret the factors influencing their presence or absence a number of factors differentiate aquatic pesticide pollution patterns from other pollution types e g nutrients which makes them especially challenging for long term monitoring and trend detection for instance pesticides include hundreds of different active ingredients which differ in their chemical properties and thus in their environmental behaviour reaction to specific mitigation measures and ecotoxicity pesticide use patterns which are generally crop and region specific can also change markedly over time due to changing pest pressure and as compounds get banned and replaced by others schreder and dickey 2005 since chemical analyses of pesticides is time consuming and costly the compound diversity inherent to pesticide pollution poses a challenge for developing and maintaining a consistent pesticide monitoring program over time spycher et al 2018 individual pesticides often exhibit seasonal application patterns which are reflected in pronounced seasonality of their concentrations in streams e g adams and thurman 1991 leu et al 2005 leu et al 2010 furthermore pesticide transport to surface water is typically triggered by rainfall events leu et al 2004 doppler et al 2012 or mishandling during dry periods kreuger 1998 which can cause highly variable concentrations peaks of short duration i e a few hours in small catchments from an ecological viewpoint these concentration peaks are of special concern sch√§fer et al 2012 beketov et al 2013 therefore even multi year data series may only contain a limited number of high concentration events that can be used for trend analysis e g lerch et al 2011a the problem of observing a limited number of high concentrations peaks in surface waters is exacerbated by the strong dependence between the coincidence of pesticide application with precipitation events particularly with herbicides leu et al 2004 singer 2005 lerch et al 2011a doppler et al 2012 local pesticide use data i e pesticide type quantity location and timing of application is often not available and has been shown to play a dominant role in determining pesticide losses ryberg and gilliom 2015 furthermore there are pesticides that degrade slowly in and have a strong affinity to soils such as pyrethroids such pesticides have been shown to be mobilized by rain events in seasons proceeding their application which further obscures the identification of seasonal trends delgado moreno et al 2011 budd et al 2020 thus pesticide monitoring in surface waters is challenged by choosing the appropriate sampling strategy to meet both the monitoring objectives and to be able to capture the strong interannual variability in concentrations key aspects in designing the appropriate sampling strategy is choosing the sub sampling frequency and the factor i e time or flow controlling this frequency for composite water samples the time period in which composite samples are formed is also a key design aspect the monitoring data can represent significantly different measured quantities depending on the chosen sampling strategy employed detecting temporal trends from such data is additionally challenged by the large variety of relevant compounds section 2 2 and the need to account for hydrological effects section 2 4 one way of addressing these challenges is by conducting long term monitoring over several growing seasons or years i e 5 years in this review with a consistent sampling scheme long term monitoring can help define the range and interannual variability of aquatic pesticide pollution which provides greater context when comparing pesticide levels from year to year long term monitoring can also help determine the extent that confounding factors affect pesticide transport to surface waters over a range of environmental and agricultural conditions if consistent patterns are observed over a variety of conditions more confidence can be made in statements about observed trends the current scientific literature has studied the issue of detecting trends from water quality time series hirsch et al 2010 ryberg and vecchia 2013 lloyd et al 2014 reviewed statistical techniques used to detect changes in hydrochemistry and provided a conceptual framework for choosing the appropriate statistical analysis method based on the scientific question being addressed and the structure of the data under analysis however to date there is a knowledge gap in how pesticide specific challenges affect long term trend detection and which mitigation measures have consistently demonstrated long term efficacy in such monitoring studies therefore there is a need for a comprehensive review that assembles all the lessons learned from the various long term pesticide monitoring studies throughout the world in order to get the most out of existing monitoring programs and enhance the design of future programs the objectives of this literature review is to answer the following questions how does the studies design address the issue of confounding factors which sampling strategy is appropriate to meet monitoring objectives what are metrics used to describe interannual variability in pesticide pollution levels how do the studies statistically account for confounding factors and make annual values more comparable what factors have been commonly associated with long term aquatic pesticide trends what kind of mitigation measures have been demonstrated to be effective based on the long term monitoring data what are limitations to existing monitoring programs in section 1 1 we start by discussing a theoretical monitoring design aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation measures and suggest ways inferences can be drawn if the monitoring is less than ideal we then provide a general overview of the confounding factors that make interpreting long term aquatic pesticide pollution data difficult and introduce a causal diagram that maps the interconnectivity of these factors fig 1 section 2 0 discusses common methods used in the reviewed literature which includes sampling strategies substance selection for chemical analysis metrics used to describe the interannual variability in pesticide pollution and the statistical treatment of factors affecting pesticide concentrations section 3 0 discusses the specific factors from the reviewed literature observed to affect long term pesticide trends and the limitations of the monitoring design in section 4 0 we conclude with recommendations for future aquatic pesticide monitoring programs in the supporting information we present the methods used for our literature search and provide a table that summarizes the reviewed case studies table s2 1 1 evaluating effectiveness of mitigation measures the effectiveness of a specific mitigation measure can be evaluated by monitoring before i e baseline and after its implementation while simultaneously monitoring a control this is known as a before after control impact baci design which aims to quantify the effect size i e the effectiveness of a mitigation measure and differentiate environmental changes due to some planned intervention from other factors green 1979 downes et al 2002 the before monitoring forms a baseline and should be long enough to establish an envelope of normal behaviour or variability pesticide concentrations in flowing waters tend to exhibit strong seasonality kreuger 1998 therefore sampling should cover the full range of seasons and more than one instance of each season should be sampled this means that baseline sampling would need to span at least two years but ideally three or more depending on the strength of the interannual variability downes et al 2002 a baseline is important for two reasons the first is to form a basis to evaluate whether a significant change has occurred the second reason is that baseline monitoring can indicate whether there is a pre existing trend which may indicate the influence of factors other than the implemented mitigation measure the control impact component refers to the simultaneous monitoring of the site being impacted and a control site that is outside the influence of the impact downes et al 2002 in hydrology the control impact design can be implemented through paired catchment experiments which provide a logical basis to separate to some extent water quality responses from natural or human induced disturbances see neary 2016 for a review national databases on catchment characteristics such as streamcat by the united states environmental protection agency hill et al 2016 can be useful in finding an appropriate control site if similar changes are observed at both the control and impact sites after mitigation then it would be illogical to infer that the changes were due to the mitigation due to the inherent costs and difficulties of conducting a baci design in long term environmental experiments at the catchment scale all long term pesticide studies we reviewed lack one or more of the baci elements i e the before or control thus long term pesticide studies are observational studies by nature which are empirical investigations that monitor and collect data on key status indicators e g in stream concentrations to elucidate trends but lack a baseline or experimental controls rosenbaum 2002 observational studies are potentially useful because they allow us to document progress toward policy goals and can indicate if more action is needed however without a baseline and or an experimental control it can be difficult to isolate for factors contributing to cause and effect relationships for instance peak pesticide concentrations in surface waters often coincide with rainfall events due to the runoff generated from fields of pesticide application leu et al 2004 doppler et al 2012 therefore drier annual weather conditions i e lower frequency and intensity of rainfall events could lead to less runoff resulting in lower pesticide concentrations in surface waters if the coincidence of rainfall events and pesticide application was the only relationship governing the transport of pesticides to surface waters the main cause of pesticide loss reduction would be the prevailing drier weather conditions in this case it would be incorrect to conclude that any mitigation measure implemented during the same time period was effective in the absence of a baci type design runge et al 2019 recommends the use of causal inference methods on observational time series to identify and quantify causal interdependencies of the underlying system such methods often require large high dimensional datasets which makes them less suitable for long term pesticide monitoring programs ryberg et al 2020 provides an example of such an effort by applying structural equation models to infer major causal factors driving long term atrazine and deethylatrazine concentration trends in conterminous u s streams which turned out to be corn acreage moisture supply and tile drainage downes et al 2002 has proposed a less stringent levels of evidence approach that takes into account nine causal criteria in order to lower the inference uncertainty table 1 using the levels of evidence approach provides a practical framework to interpret data from observational studies and can help to elucidate the effectiveness of specific mitigation measures from other factors however it is important to note that none of the criteria by themselves can establish definite causality instead various sorts of correlative evidence can collectively build a robust case to infer causality hill 1965 who was first to formalize these nine types of evidence argued against demanding that any particular criterion be met and that there is no formal way to weigh some criteria more heavily than others 1 2 factors affecting the evaluation of aquatic pesticide pollution accounting for factors that affect aquatic pesticide pollution is important for two reasons the first is to make year to year pesticide pollution levels more comparable the second is to make an accurate evaluation of the effectiveness of specific mitigation measures to better understand the observational case studies in this review see table s2 we explicitly mapped the main factors ignoring minor feedbacks for clarity that affect pesticide concentrations in surface waters with a focus on agricultural pesticide use fig 1 we would expect a causal diagram for non agricultural pesticide use to be similar to fig 1 however the anthropogenic factors such as farming practices and crop types could be replaced by urban pesticide use practices and the farmyard source pathway could be replaced by urban hardscapes and landscapes having this visual tool allows us to evaluate the levels of the evidence table 1 and hypothesize plausible explanations that could explain changes in observed pesticide levels fig 1 divides the factors into two broad categories 1 environmental factors and 2 anthropogenic factors in this context a confounding factor is one that can disguise trends caused by changes in pesticide use or the effect of mitigation measures the main confounding environmental factor that can affect nearly all others is the weather e g precipitation evapotranspiration et temperature and wind the weather can influence which organisms are likely to thrive including both pests and beneficial predators which subsequently affects which pesticide products are applied and their dosage the weather also drives the transport of pesticides from their site of application to surface water larson et al 1998 an anthropogenic factor that influences aquatic pesticide levels is the changing of pesticide use patterns over time this includes the switching of products due to changes in pest pressure also to avoid resistance hawkins et al 2019 or crops furthermore pesticide registration which is the permission granted by authorities to allow the sale pricing and taxation and use of specific products can change the pesticides available on the market this ultimately determines which pesticides will be used and exposed to the environment additionally farmers may adopt mitigation measures against point and diffuse pesticide losses either voluntarily or with monetary compensation agricultural point sources have been frequently found to originate from farmyards neumann et al 2002 measures that target point sources include courses on proper pesticide disposal and handling cleaning of spraying equipment and restrictions on aesthetic farmyard pesticide use kreuger 1998 a common measure to limit diffuse losses are to install buffer strips which are vegetated spray free zones between the fields and waterways designed to reduce pesticide spray drift runoff and erosion inputs into surface waters reichenberger et al 2007 there are two general analysis methods to treat confounding factors in order to reveal potential trends caused by changes in pesticide use or mitigation measures 1 stratification and 2 multivariate regression analysis both methods require confounding factors to be identified and monitored during the study period braga et al 2012 stratification is the process in which subgroups or strata are formed based on the value of the confounder and compared within their respective strata e g years are categorized by their total annual rainfall stratification is useful if there are only one or two confounders and if there are several years of data multivariate regression analysis uses a mathematical model that estimates the associations between a number of independent variables e g river flow seasonal pesticide use and one dependent variable i e pesticide concentration in surface water the drawbacks of regression analysis are that the interpretation of the results may be inaccurate if assumptions of the mathematical models are not satisfied an objective of this review is to see which confounding factors were commonly dealt with and the methods used to account for them this will be discussed further in section 2 4 2 0 methods from case studies 2 1 sampling strategies the choice between sampling strategies depends strongly on the monitoring objectives for the monitoring of aquatic pesticide levels three sampling strategies were common to the reviewed studies 1 grab sampling 2 time proportional sampling and 3 flow proportional sampling bundschuh et al 2014 compared all three sampling strategies and found that occasional grab sampling during periods without rainfall is not a sensible option because it can substantially underestimates the peak pesticide exposure triggered by transport losses across the land water interface time proportional composite sampling strategy is recommended for assessing the ecotoxicological risks because this strategy reflects concentrations levels that aquatic organisms actually experience however time proportional sampling may underestimate the maximum acute exposure because sampling over a constant time interval can cause the sample to be diluted with low flow or baseflow aliquots with little or no pesticides therefore if peak exposures are of concern an event triggered sampling strategy is recommended oelsner et al 2017 flow proportional sampling provides concentrations which can be useful for calculating loads and loss rates if quantity of pesticide application is known however it can be challenging to implement because sampling is driven by unpredictable weather conditions one way of making flow proportional sampling more practical is to conduct time proportional sampling and to weight the composite sample on flow measurements e g daouk et al 2019 the main issue irrespective of the sampling strategy is whether the sampling frequency is high enough to capture the short duration pesticide concentration dynamics which can be less than a few hours in small headwater catchments leu et al 2004 doppler et al 2012 furthermore there are constraints from the cost and labour of chemical analysis therefore samples are usually combined to form a composite sample for chemical analysis how composite samples are formed will depend on the objectives of the pesticide exposure monitoring for instance 14 day composite samples would be adequate to assess chronic exposure however if the objective is to assess acute exposure composite samples would need to be 3 5 days or less spycher et al 2018 a promising alternative to the aforementioned active sampling strategies is the use of passive samplers which require no technical facilities or power supply and can be deployed flexibly both temporarily and spatially bundschuh et al 2014 there are however several shortcomings that confound the level of confidence associated with the data obtained from passive samplers such as the optimal duration of sampler deployment possible influence of seasons and biofouling implications of other non target water quality parameters e g dissolved organic matter nutrients and chemical properties of compounds on their sorption rate mi√®ge et al 2012 for these reasons none of the long term aquatic pesticide studies we reviewed used passive samplers for their monitoring programs nevertheless the use of passive samplers to monitor aquatic pesticide pollution is an area of active research e g moschet et al 2015 lao et al 2016 liao et al 2017 xue et al 2017 curchod et al 2020 all studies focused their sampling over the plant growing season which starts between march may and ends between september october in the northern hemisphere kreuger and nilsson 2001 extended their sampling to the off season months i e october to november and observed substantial pesticide losses in 1992 suggesting that sampling is required in late fall and early winter for a more comprehensive assessment sampling in the off season is especially important in regions where most rainfall events occur in the winter months e g california which can lead to a delay between the time of application and increased concentrations in surface waters wang et al 2017 2 2 limitations of substance selection for chemical analysis a recurring theme from this review is the uncertainty and possible underestimation of the aquatic pesticide exposure because the suite of analytes were limited without a comprehensive chemical analysis over time e g spycher et al 2018 the possibility remains that some unscreened substances may be present in quantities that are harmful to aquatic organisms daouk et al 2019 recommends collecting additional information such as pesticide use i e application and registration to help narrow down target screening and to keep costs manageable luo et al 2018 developed the surface water prioritization swmp model to prioritize the monitoring of specific pesticides and geographic locations by incorporating pesticide use data physicochemical properties aquatic toxicity and watershed morphology additionally improvements in chemical analytics are likely to occur over the course of a long term monitoring program which can potentially lead to different statements about the chemical status of rivers wahlin and grimvall 2008 stenr√∏d 2015 and lindstr√∂m et al 2015 noted that limits of quantification lowered over the course of their studies which can replace pesticides that were once below the detection limit with quantified concentration values in the charmilles catchment the ecotoxicological risk increased as of 2013 after nicosulfuron water quality criteria for chronic exposure 0 0087 Œºg l annex 2 rs 814 201 wpo 1998 was included in the chemical analysis daouk et al 2019 which also suggests that the ecotoxicological risk could have been underestimated prior to its inclusion thus there are two reasons that the chemical status of rivers could change due to improvements in analytical methods first is from finding newly included substances at relevant concentrations that were previously excluded e g nicosulfuron in charmilles daouk et al 2019 second is from the lowering of the limit of detection over time substances that were once below the detection limit could be replaced with quantified albeit low concentrations if the detected substance is toxic at low concentrations such as pyrethroids e g cypermethrin this could increase the quantified risk of exposure to aquatic organisms conversely the exposure risk could be lowered as limits of quantification loq decrease and substances continue to be very low or nondetectable for instance cases that previously replaced values below the loq with half the loq value may now be replaced by actually concentrations that are less than half the loq lowering the exposure risk despite the inappropriateness and criticism of substituting censored pesticide monitoring data it still commonly occurs instead there are more appropriate methods to analyze censored pesticide data for trends e g helsel 2012 therneau 2013 wang et al 2016 lee 2020 furthermore van leeuwen and vermeire 2007 recommends conducting a sensitivity analysis with a range of values between zero and loq instead of replacing concentrations below loqs with a single value in this way improved analytics should result in a smaller range of uncertainty rather than inconsistent results nonetheless pesticides that are currently known to be toxic at concentrations below or around the limit of detection for many analytical methods e g neonicotinoids and pyrethroids boye et al 2019 will drive the need for improved method detection limits and have the potential to play a larger role in future risk assessments additionally some pesticides are difficult to detect analytically for instance glyphosate requires a separate and costly analytical method ib√°√±ez et al 2005 boye et al 2019 for this reason glyphosate is often excluded from the suite of substances being analyzed moschet et al 2014 stone et al 2014 this data gap can lead to the potential underestimation of the exposure risk and will be discussed further in section 3 3 toxic tradeoffs consistent sampling and laboratory practices are critical to the interpretation of long term environmental trends wahlin and grimvall 2008 have found strong evidence that long term trends in measured nutrient concentrations can be more extensively influenced by changes in sampling and laboratory practices than by actual changes in the state of the environment this raises important concerns regarding quality assurances in environmental monitoring and laboratory analysis however it is important to note that consistency should not come at the expense of improvements in basic monitoring design it is of little use for a monitoring program to continue in the same way if it is known to be unfit for purpose therefore downes et al 2002 recommends that the design of new monitoring programs should consider prior experience which is subject to critical review and that improvements in design are favoured over adherence to heuristic traditions 2 3 metrics to describe the interannual variability in pesticide pollution a variety of different metrics and statistical methods have been used by the reviewed studies to evaluate for pesticide trends in surface waters a common approach is to take the measured pesticide concentrations calculate a time weighted annual average value then sum the values for all detected pesticides kreuger and nilsson 2001 hermosin et al 2013 an issue with this approach is that interannual pesticide concentrations can vary considerably over the years often denoted by short term peaks in concentration over the application period and surrounded by frequent low or nondetect values this can skew the mean and underestimate short term acute exposure thus the use of box plots is helpful to depict the interannual distribution i e median upper and lower quartiles 10th and 90th percentiles and outliers of total pesticides in particular several studies schreder and dickey 2005 phillips et al 2007 todd and struger 2014 used box plots to show the interannual variability of pesticide concentrations and a clear reduction in concentrations before and after the ban of specific pesticide products censored values are typically set to any single value lower than the reporting limit with the box plot distribution below the reporting limit blanked out helsel 2012 richards and baker 1993 displayed concentration time series practically through a concentration exceedancy curve cec to plot a cec samples are first sorted by decreasing concentrations allotting a duration of time for each sample for grab samples the time duration allotted to each sample is equal to half the time between it and the preceding sample plus half that between it and the following sample it is important to have a sufficiently short duration of time between samples to create a useful cec plot richards and baker 1993 stated that a majority of their time intervals did not exceed 2 days and that longer intervals 7 days were typically associated with low flow periods with low pesticide concentrations after time allotment concentrations are plotted against cumulative time expressed as a percentage of entire observation period these cumulative frequency plots display the percentage of time a given pesticide exceeds a particular concentration e g environmental quality standard which can be compared annually for concentration exceedance trends annual pesticide loads are another important metric for evaluating water quality trends pesticide loads can be calculated if measurements of flow are taken concurrently with sampling in the small charmilles stream a clear reduction in annual pesticides loads from 2008 to 2013 was observed whereas the interannual concentrations were more erratic due to interannual variability in river discharge daouk et al 2019 this decreasing trend in loads was linked to substantially reduced pesticide wash off after rain events due to the installation of grass strips between vine rows this example shows us how pesticide loads can be a useful metric in evaluating the effectiveness of mitigation measures and that analyzing concentrations alone which showed no clear trends would not have led to the same conclusion additionally the variability in annual pesticide use can be treated by normalizing annual pesticide loads with the total amount of pesticides applied annually this equates to an annual pesticide loss rate comparing annual loss rates is one way to evaluate whether measures other than changing annual pesticide application rates had an effect for instance singer 2005 showed that pesticide losses to lake greifensee in switzerland were mainly related to the coincidence of pesticide application and rain events i e timing quantity and intensity there was no evidence that the implemented pesticide loss reduction measures e g sprayer inspections buffer strips were affecting loss rates which suggests that restricting the quantities of pesticide use was the main mitigation measure that reduced pesticide loads to lake greifensee singer 2005 similarly leu et al 2010 found close relationships between herbicide loss rates and catchment metrics for fast flow during the application periods for six streams in the us and switzerland accurate pesticide use data i e location timing and quantity of specific pesticide application is also critical for the interpretation of monitoring results for patterns and trends but may be difficult to obtain lerch et al 2011a used corn planting progress as a surrogate for the timing of pesticide application which showed promising results when combined with streamflow and degradation rates for predicting atrazine loads schreder and dickey 2005 used annual sales of pesticides as a substitute for pesticide use data using such proxy data can be useful if the area under study is large enough so that statistical downscaling is meaningful or for simple agronomic systems with limited crop diversity i e monocropping where a few herbicides dominate stenr√∏d 2015 extended their analyses by assessing ecotoxicological risk which combines the exposure assessment with an ecological effects assessment van leeuwen and vermeire 2007 an effect assessment estimates the relationship between the exposure level of a substance and the severity of an effect to an organism the effects assessment can be used to establish the threshold of allowable concentrations in the environment e g forming the basis for environmental quality standards since different substances vary in their dose response relationship with differing aquatic organisms a long term aquatic pesticide monitoring program would require the analysis of a large spectrum of pesticides to conduct an accurate ecotoxicological assessment spycher et al 2018 for instance 96 active ingredients and 19 metabolites were analyzed in 6 small norwegian catchments which allowed stenr√∏d 2015 to evaluate water quality trends regarding mixture toxicity to account for this stenr√∏d 2015 calculated a summed monthly relative cumulative risk value or cumulative risk for short cumulative risk is the sum of the ratios between the measured environmental concentration and its environmental quality standard eqs ec 2011 which was based on the most sensitive aquatic test species for the active ingredient of each pesticide from her cumulative risk assessment she observed both a reduction in the detection frequency and concentrations for in stream pesticides in catchments growing heavily sprayed potato and vegetable crops while catchments mainly comprised of cereal production showed no significant reduction in the environmental pesticide loads in general stenr√∏d 2015 concluded that the presence of in stream pesticides can be mainly explained by pesticide use on nearby land areas and the prevailing weather conditions 2 4 treatment of factors affecting pesticide trends most studies included some treatment of factors such as river flow seasonality and or pesticide use when comparing aquatic pesticide pollution levels from year to year as already mentioned singer 2005 accounted for changes in annual pesticide use by calculating and comparing annual loss rates however a few long term studies were observational in nature cerejeira et al 2003 schreder and dickey 2005 meaning that the study mainly focused on observing whether pesticide concentration trends were taking place rather than attempting to determine the precise cause of the trend e g the effectiveness of mitigation measure other than restricting use for those studies explicit treatment of factors was unnecessary several authors accounted for river flow by calculating flow weighted average concentration bodo 1991 richards and baker 1993 lerch et al 2011a 2011b whereas others power et al 1999 phillips et al 2007 todd and struger 2014 noted that no flow adjustment was needed because their analyses showed no correlation between flows and concentrations power et al 1999 found that lindane was an exception and that its concentrations correlated with flow rates in the river thames which they believed were due to its chemical properties several studies treated seasonality in their trend analysis by introducing stratification to nonparametric tests for example bodo 1991 used the seasonal mann kendall test hirsch et al 1982 and phillips et al 2007 used a seasonal step trend analysis helsel and hirsch 1992 seasonal stratification is common in the analyses of pesticide time series because peak concentrations in agricultural settings typically occur seasonally within the spring and summer months when planting and pesticide application particularly herbicides take place see table 2 it should be noted that certain pesticides which degrade slowly in and have a strong affinity to soils e g diazinon fipronil pyrethroids that are applied in regions where rain events dominate in the winter months e g california have shown to be delayed in their transport to surface waters relative to their time of application budd et al 2015 2020 wang et al 2017 this fact does not undermine the importance of evaluating seasonality in the analyses of pesticide time series but highlights the fact that the seasonality of pesticide application and peak surface water concentrations do not always coincide researchers from the usgs created a parametric regression model specifically designed for analysing pesticide concentration trends treating both seasonal and streamflow related variability which they called seawave q vecchia et al 2008 2009 ryberg and gilliom 2015 used seawave q to analyze pesticide trends in major rivers throughout the us from 1992 to 2010 where they found concentration trends mostly agreeing with pesticide use trends sullivan et al 2009 compared seawave q with and without streamflow adjustment to the nonparametric seasonal kendall test seakan by analyzing 10 years of pesticide concentrations in the us corn belt streams they favoured the seawave q method because it required substantially fewer measurements than the flow adjustment procedure for seakan and found that including flow adjustment was an important part of trend analysis because changing flow conditions could alter or disguise trends caused by changes in pesticide use or management practices to the best of our knowledge process based models have yet to be used to evaluate long term pesticide monitoring data a more flexible alternative for treating confounders is the use of process based catchment scale hydrological pesticide transport models such as the one developed by ammann et al 2020 for the ossingen catchment in switzerland such a model could provide process based estimates of pesticide concentrations in surface water it can be used to simulate the situation before and after the implementation of a mitigation measure e g 50 reduction in pesticide use and can therefore be used to simulate the counterfactual assuming that no measures were taken this type of modelling could help fill the gap from missing baseline monitoring by calculating pesticide concentrations using historic meteorological forcings in essence this would be using a conceptual hydrological model for quantitative counterfactual thinking ferraro 2009 which attempts to answer the question does the intervention i e mitigation measure work better than no intervention at all using counterfactual thinking to develop various model scenarios allows one to estimate the expected effect size from introducing mitigation measures and to assess the potential conditions necessary to meet water quality objectives wang et al 2019 proposes to supplement physical and statistical models used to analyze aquatic pesticide pollution data with machine learning methods e g random forests which are tools that can extract important trends from data machine learning methods could be used to conduct meta analyses that compiles data from many different monitoring programs across different regions to identify potential relationships between the fate and transport of pesticides in the aquatic environment the effectiveness of specific mitigation measures and a large number of current and historical factors at the given sites e g land use demographics geomorphological and hydrological attributes machine learning methods have the advantage of relying on few assumptions however they are notably more difficult to interpret rudin 2019 therefore machine learning methods can be used as an initial screening tool to identify the factors that influence aquatic pesticide pollution the most afterwards physical and statistical models can be applied considering these factors to expand upon limited spatial and temporal monitoring data and to gain a better mechanistic understanding of the processes governing aquatic pesticide fate and transport 3 0 factors associated with pesticide trends and limitations of monitoring design several common factors have been associated with long term aquatic pesticide pollution from the reviewed studies table 2 the two most common factors were pesticide application rates 18 studies which includes bans and restricted use of specific products and hydrology 16 studies particularly post application rainfall runoff events fourteen studies have recognized or statistically treated for seasonal patterns in aquatic pesticide pollution which is primarily due to increases in pesticide use during the plant growing season in predominantly agricultural catchments or seasonal pest pressure in predominantly urban catchments ten studies discussed the chemical properties of pesticides e g sorption persistence volatility photolysis to partly explain observed differences in concentration patterns between different substances and why long term trends were detectable for some pesticides and not for others only four studies specifically attributed mitigation measures other than limiting pesticide use to curbing aquatic pesticide pollution a notable exception comes from a study conducted in costa rica carazo rojas et al 2018 where crop growing seasons and pesticide application extend throughout the year in this case pesticide application patterns were not a good predictor of aquatic pesticide concentrations higher pesticide application rates mainly fungicides throughout the rainiest months were associated with lower aquatic pesticide concentrations suggesting a dilution effect tropical environments prove to be an exceptional agro ecosystem where the occurrence of aquatic pesticide pollution may be more related to environmental factors that govern the fate and transport of pesticides e g rainfall events soil properties adsorption runoff leaching and degradation rather than the anthropogenic factor of pesticide application rates furthermore the timing of peak concentrations in surface water may not necessarily coincide with seasonal pesticide application patterns there can be a delay of several months between pesticide application and peak concentrations in regions where rainfall events occur with greater frequency in the winter months e g california this delay is particularly prominent for those pesticides e g diazinon fipronil pyrethroids that degrade slowly in and have a strong affinity to soils budd et al 2015 2020 wang et al 2017 wang et al 2017 found that the diazinon application rates from the preceding year was better at explaining the variance in exceedance frequency compared to the current year s application rates which suggests that the physiochemical properties of diazinon and the prevailing weather conditions in california may cause a significant delay in diazinon transport to surface waters a few other less commonly noted factors shown to be associated with aquatic pesticide pollution include catchment size soil type catchment flashiness population density crop prices and transboundary pesticide sources from neighbouring countries although these factors relate more to spatial differences rather than temporal trends they provide important insights into observed pesticide patterns through inter catchment comparisons richards and baker 1993 observed the tendency for peak observed concentrations to increase as watershed size decreased which they theorized was due to the greater mixing and dilution in larger watersheds that receive water from various tributaries richards and baker 1993 lerch et al 2015 and stenr√∏d 2015 noted that the greater proportion of fine grained soil types in the near surface could lead to less pesticide sorption and more rapid transport to streams similarly leu et al 2010 observed an increasing risk for herbicide losses with the flashiness of the catchment todd and struger 2014 found significant relationships between population density or urban land cover and the concentrations of urban use insecticides in surface water bodo 1991 linked a decline in atrazine concentrations with a drop in corn prices illustrating a direct connection between economics crop selection and pesticides use or non use vryzas et al 2009 found evidence of transboundary aquatic pesticide pollution sources in three greek rivers that border bulgaria which suggested the clandestine use of banned substances i e ddt and Œ≥ hch by their neighbour 3 1 identifying urban pesticide sources understanding the main source and pathways of aquatic pesticide pollution can help with the development of targeted mitigation measures a major source of pesticide pollution to surface water comes from agricultural pesticide use however a few long term studies also highlight the importance of urban pesticide use as a source phillips et al 2007 ryberg et al 2010 todd and struger 2014 budd et al 2020 specific pesticides that are registered for non agricultural use can be particularly useful as tracers to identify urban pesticide sources for instance todd and struger 2014 used the ratio of the active ingredients in products sold for urban use and compared them to the observed concentration ratios in streams and found them to be somewhat similar suggesting an urban source in catchments with both agricultural and nonagricultural pesticide use ryberg and gilliom 2015 found that concentration trends could be explained by a combination of agricultural use trends and concentration trends in urban streams it is important to note that long term aquatic pesticide monitoring programs may be inadequate for the purpose of identifying pesticide sources because they typically lack the high frequency temporal resolution necessary for the analysis of source dynamics e g peter et al 2020 3 2 effective mitigation measures a majority of the long term studies we reviewed attributed a reduction in pesticide use including bans or use restrictions as the main factor linked to reductions in aquatic pesticide concentrations table 2 restricting or banning the use of a pesticide is a particularly powerful mitigation measure that directly affects the quantity of that pesticide available for transport to surface waters however the benefits of an outright ban can be obscured if the pesticide is simply replaced by another section 3 3 or if it can persist in groundwater which can be a long term source of pesticides to surface waters even decades after a ban t√∂rnquist et al 2007 larsson et al 2014 furthermore the effectiveness of pesticide use restrictions can be unclear because the quantity of pesticides that are ultimately applied is influenced by a number of other factors such as pest pressure and weather conditions the moderate effects of potentially effective mitigation measures other than use restrictions were often indistinguishable against the background of interannual variability in surface water concentrations nonetheless numerous short term i e 3 years studies have shown that specific mitigation strategies e g grassed buffer strips spray drift reduction better handling practices are effective to varying degrees at reducing pesticide losses to surface water reichenberger et al 2007 although a decrease in pesticide pollution is expected after bans or policies on restricted use there are a number of cases where declining trends in pesticide concentrations were observed before such measures were put into place e g power et al 1999 philipps et al 2007 todd and struger 2014 the presence of a decreasing trend before a ban puts into question their effectiveness and indicates the presence of other factors that could be contributing to a decreasing trend it also emphasizes the importance of sampling before the implementation of mitigation measures in order to establish a baseline todd and struger 2014 speculated that the decreasing trend before the ban could be related to increased public awareness due to bans in neighbouring provinces that potentially led to voluntary reductions in pesticide use similarly wang et al 2017 concluded that a downward diazinon use trend from 1994 to 1998 which occurred before introducing regulatory stimulus could have resulted from changing pest pressures economy or market forces only one study by singer 2005 specified a water quality objective to be met through the implementation of mitigation measures which was to reduce pesticide loads in lake greifensee switzerland by 50 from 1993 to 2003 all other studies did not state meeting specific water quality objectives singer 2005 analyzed pesticide loads within lake greifensee from 1993 to 2003 concluding that none of the mitigation measures e g 3 m wide buffer strips along water courses regulated crop rotation field sprayer inspections soil erosion measures except restrictions on the allowable quantity of pesticide use led to detectable trends in load reduction this is consistent with lerch et al 2011b who concluded that best management practices i e grassed waterways conservation reserve programs terraces implemented in the goodwater creek catchment from 1992 to 2006 were either ineffective and or insufficient in their areal extent to achieve meaningful reductions in herbicide transport there are currently no long term studies that have attributed buffers to reducing long term aquatic pesticide pollution however this does not mean that they are ineffective since there are numerous studies that have demonstrated their short term efficacy reichenberger et al 2007 in the charmilles stream annual pesticide loads decreased by 60 5 2 2 1 kg year between 2008 and 2015 daouk et al 2019 this decrease in loads was linked to the installation of grass strips between vine rows in 2009 2010 which appeared to have reduced peak flows following rain events however daouk et al 2019 concluded that establishing precise quantitative relationships between specific mitigation measures and observations was difficult because several measures e g washing stations better storage were implemented simultaneously by varying degrees in addition to other confounding factors e g interannual variability in precipitation in the vemmenh√∂g catchment sweden numerous mitigation measures were implemented to reduce aquatic pesticide pollution in late 1994 and from 1997 to 1999 kreuger and nilsson 2001 in late 1994 a meeting was held with farmers where information was shared on sources of pesticide contamination reduction strategies and safe pesticide use afterwards free anonymous consultations were offered to farmers where they were given site specific advice such as safe storage of pesticides best practices for filling and cleaning of sprayers and appropriate parking grounds for sprayers additionally restricting aesthetic herbicide spraying on farmyards and other areas with low organic matter was discussed these initial measures reduced annual average pesticide concentrations by about 65 which kreuger 1998 suggests may be mainly attributed to the reducing farmyard point sources and aesthetic herbicide use in 1997 new legislation was introduced requiring spray free buffer zones and compulsory record keeping of pesticide applications from 1998 to 1999 a program was introduced that provided small and mid sized farmers economical compensation over a 5 year period for complying to risk reduction measures such as spray free buffer zones safe filling and cleaning areas e g biobeds sprayer inspections licensing and training courses which contributed to an additional 25 reduction in total annual average pesticide concentrations combined these mitigation measures resulted in a 90 cumulative reduction of total annual average pesticide concentrations in surface water between 1992 and 2000 kreuger and nilsson 2001 hermosin et al 2013 associated a decreasing trend in mean herbicide levels from 2002 to 2010 in the guadalquivir river of southern spain to regulations changes in authorized products and actions courses and technical workshops on pesticide management practices surface water concentrations of diuron decreased by 99 2 36 Œºg l to 0 3 Œºg l from 2003 to 2010 and terbuthylazine decreased by 78 0 89 Œºg l to 0 20 Œºg l from 2008 to 2010 although substantial decreases were observed it is unclear what the relative contribution of regulations and actions were to this decrease similarly budd et al 2020 attributed a decreasing trend in aquatic bifenthrin concentrations from 2008 to 2018 in northern california to the adoption of regulations and licensing applied to professional pest control operators that limited their application of pyrethroids to structures the simultaneous implementation of several mitigation measures is common to national action plans aimed at curbing aquatic pesticide pollution along with the implementation of measures is the surface water monitoring program to gauge the progress towards water quality objectives such monitoring programs are not designed to evaluate the effectiveness of individual measures instead the evaluation of individual mitigation measures would require an experimental approach such as the baci design downes et al 2002 nonetheless these four studies kreuger and nilsson 2001 hermosin et al 2013 daouk et al 2019 budd et al 2020 demonstrated that mitigation measures other than pesticide use restrictions have the potential to produce detectable long term reductions in pesticide concentrations or loads in all four studies a reduction of greater than 45 led to conclusions that the implemented mitigation measures were the causal criteria thus relying on the strength of association and temporality within the levels of evidence approach table 1 3 3 toxic tradeoffs toxic tradeoffs refers to the scenario where banned or restricted pesticides are replaced by others which may not necessarily lead to improvements to the aquatic environment for instance power et al 1999 observed declining atrazine herbicide concentrations in the thames estuary between 1988 and 1997 after atrazine was placed on the uk red list i e banned in august 1993 atrazine concentrations continued to decrease significantly while the concentrations of simazine stabilized and showed no further declines from 1994 to 1997 this suggests that the atrazine ban led to the increased use of simazine as a substitute therefore there may have been little improvement to the cumulative toxicity in the thames estuary after the atrazine ban because simazine has similar toxic effects to atrazine cheremisinoff and rosenfeld 2010 similarly the net effect on aquatic organisms may not necessarily improve if a banned pesticide is replaced with one that is more toxic to aquatic organisms for example in the charmilles catchment several substances replaced atrazine after its ban in 2012 one of which was nicosulfuron nicosulfuron requires lower application rates compared to atrazine because of its greater effectiveness however it has an eqs value approximately 100 times lower than atrazine and can contribute significantly to the overall ecotoxicological risk daouk et al 2019 furthermore substitution of one pesticide with another may lead to an increase in surface water concentrations due to its differing chemical properties e g sorption degradation half lives for instance richards and baker 1993 attributed a higher time weighted mean concentration for atrazine compared to alachlor due to its greater mobility and relative half life therefore the dosage ecotoxicity and chemical properties are critical factors to include when assessing the replacement of one pesticide with another another example of a toxic tradeoff occurred in the us after the federally mandated phaseout of insecticides diazinon and chlorpyrifos in 2001 schreder and dicky 2005 phillips et al 2007 ryberg et al 2010 following the 2001 phaseout schreder and dickey 2005 observed a significant increase of the carbaryl concentrations in two northwestern us creeks phillips et al 2007 extended the analysis to 20 sites throughout the us and did not detect significant changes in carbaryl concentrations in the northeastern and midwestern us in response to the phaseout from 2000 to 2008 ryberg et al 2010 found that trends for carbaryl were mostly nonsignificant and mixed upward and downward in a few locations and instead detected significant upward trends for fipronil and its degradation products throughout the us indicating that fipronil was the more popular substitute for organophosphate insecticides during that period three conclusions come from synthesizing the findings from these studies firstly the toxic tradeoff schreder and dicky 2005 observed seemed to be localized to the northwestern us and not generalizable across the entire us indicating a strong spatial preference for the use of specific pesticide products and the importance of site selection in the design of monitoring programs secondly analysis of different overlapping time periods can result in very different trends this is illustrated by comparing the significant carbaryl upward trend in thornton creek from 1996 to 2003 schreder and dicky 2005 followed by a downward trend from 2000 to 2008 ryberg et al 2010 significant downward trends were observed when the intervention e g pesticide ban or mitigation measure occurred within the time period as opposed to the beginning of the time period which indicates the importance of including a baseline in the trend analysis finally greater evidence indicated that fipronil was a more widespread substitute than carbaryl throughout the us from 2000 to 2008 which would have been missed from only analyzing diazinon chlorpyrifos and carbaryl this stresses the importance of having a sufficient selection of substances for chemical analysis so that accurate statements can be made regarding national scale water quality trends besides explicitly measured toxic tradeoffs there can also be hidden toxic tradeoffs due to limited sampling and chemical analytics with any kind of substitution the important aspect for monitoring is that the substitute is also analyzed otherwise there might only be an apparent improvement in water quality for instance kreuger and nilsson 2001 noted that glyphosate use doubled in the vemmenh√∂g catchment after the implementation of mitigation measures in 1994 however glyphosate concentrations were not reflected in the monitoring results from 1992 to 2000 therefore the apparent improvement to water quality in their study may have been less if glyphosate was analyzed another hidden toxic tradeoff is if banned pesticides are replaced by others that preferentially enter other parts of the environment e g atmosphere groundwater sediments that can evade detection if unmonitored although our review focuses on pesticides in surface water it is important to mention general pesticide pollution here because hidden toxic tradeoffs can be a total environmental issue for instance the herbicide prosulfocarb is a popular substitute for triazine herbicides devault et al 2019 in vavihill sweden kreuger and lindstr√∂m 2019 detected prosulfocarb at high frequencies in precipitation 55 of samples from 2012 to 2015 and high quantities of atmospheric deposition 70 Œºg m2 year from 2012 to 2015 prosulfocarb has the tendency to contaminate areas surrounding the targeted application due to its volatilization potential followed by vapour drift there have been reports in denmark and france of non targeted produce e g autumn apples that exceeded maximum prosulfocarb residue limits which makes it a potential human health hazard devault et al 2019 thus this type of hidden toxic tradeoff can lead to the appearance of improved surface water quality at the detriment of other environmental compartments which would be concealed unless monitored 4 0 conclusions the importance of collecting accurate pesticide use data has been unanimous in all the reviewed studies data on pesticide use includes the location timing and quantity of the specific pesticide products used such data can indicate which substances to include in the chemical analysis and reduce the uncertainty when interpreting monitoring results for aquatic pesticide trends although there is a need to have a standard set of analytes for chemical analyses to make results more comparable from year to year there is also a need to make updates as pesticide use changes to guard against potential toxic tradeoffs in many cases accurate pesticide use data cannot be obtained which has led to the use of proxies such as crop planting progress lerch et al 2011a and pesticide sales schreder and dickey 2005 collecting data on the implementation of mitigation measures is also critical to evaluate their overall effectiveness this includes the timing spatial extent and magnitude of the specific measures that were implemented however this data can also be difficult to obtain several studies have collected such data and were able to demonstrate long term reductions in aquatic pesticide pollution from mitigation measures kreuger and nilsson 2001 hermosin et al 2013 daouk et al 2019 budd et al 2020 it may however be difficult to separate the effects from an individual mitigation measure since several were implemented simultaneously when it comes to choosing the appropriate sampling method for surface water we emphasize the need to sample at a high enough frequency to capture the short duration concentration dynamics typical of streams in headwater catchments this can be met by either a time or flow proportional sampling strategy where the former is better at providing long term exposure patterns relevant to organisms and the latter has the benefit of being able to derive loads and potentially loss rates if quantity of pesticide application is known it is also important to consider the periods in which subsamples are mixed to form composite samples 14 day composites are suitable to assess water quality objectives for chronic exposure however composite samples would need to be 3 5 day or less to assess for acute exposure additional sampling of other environmental compartments e g atmosphere and groundwater and the periodic analysis of highly used but costly to analyze substances e g glyphosate could potentially identify some hidden toxic tradeoffs statistical analysis of long term pesticide trends in surface water should account for seasonality and make some adjustment for streamflow either through stratification e g seasonal mann kendall test hirsch et al 1982 or a multivariate regression analysis e g seawave q vecchia et al 2009 because these two factors can obscure trends caused by changes in pesticide use or management practices long term monitoring studies consistently show that reducing aquatic pesticide pollution can be linked to the ban or restricted use of specific pesticide products however several studies have observed the presence of a decreasing trend prior to a ban which indicates the presence of other influencing factors and the importance of baseline sampling to identify pre existing trends nonetheless updating and enforcing pesticide registration as the science of pesticides advances appears to be a key way to curb future pesticide pollution declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

19976,understanding household level transmission pathways of fecal pathogens can provide insight for developing effective strategies to reduce diarrheal illness in low and middle income countries we applied whole bacterial community analysis to investigate pathways of bacterial transmission in 50 rural bangladeshi households sourcetracker was used to quantify the shared microbial community in household reservoirs stored drinking water soil and hands and estimate the percentage of fecal associated bacteria from child and mothers feces in these reservoirs among the reservoirs studied most bacterial transfer occurred between mothers and children s hands and between mothers hands and stored water the relative percentage of human fecal associated bacteria in all household reservoirs was low we also quantified the number of identical amplicon sequence variants within and between individual households to assess bacterial community exchange in the domestic environment intra household sharing of bacteria between mothers and children s hands and between hands and soil was significantly greater than inter household sharing graphical abstract image 1 keywords 16s rrna gene sequencing

environment pathogens can move through environmental reservoirs including flies fomites hands soil food and water providing sufficient quantities of water adequate drinking water treatment sanitation and hygiene wash are the main strategies to block pathogen transmission pathways and reduce the occurrence of diarrheal illnesses recent field trials have investigated the impact of these interventions on diarrhea in children and found limited reductions even with high levels of compliance and no additive benefit of multiple interventions clasen et al 2014 humphrey et al 2019 luby et al 2018 2006 null et al 2018 improving our understanding of the role of environmental reservoirs in enteric pathogen transmission is important especially given the limited effectiveness of wash interventions in the field previous studies investigating environmental pathways of pathogen transmission have largely focused on identifying fecal indicators such as e coli and microbial source tracking markers in household reservoirs such as soil hands stored drinking water and children s toys boehm et al 2016 ercumen et al 2018b 2018a 2017 harris et al 2016 mattioli et al 2013 odagiri et al 2016 pickering et al 2010 2012 2011 schriewer et al 2015 vujcic et al 2014 this approach is useful because it can produce quantitative results for organisms that indicate the presence of fecal contamination however identifying traditional fecal indicators relies on pre specification of single targets bacteria as an indicator of an entire microbial community fecal microbial community in microbial source tracking which aims to distinguish fecal contamination from humans and various animals the use of single host specific targets has proven challenging because host microbiomes vary between individuals and geographically impacting the sensitivity and specificity of assays when applied to populations outside of those used to develop these assays balleste et al 2010 gawler et al 2007 harris et al 2016 jenkins et al 2009 reischer et al 2013 here we aimed to characterize transmission pathways by applying untargeted high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing to whole bacterial communities present in environmental samples new and less expensive sequencing technologies have given rise to the study of a wide variety of microbiomes to understand bacterial transmission in the built environment this research has revealed that microbiomes can be shared between environments fomites people and animals pehrsson et al 2016 song et al 2013 trinh et al 2018 shared microbiota of concern includes pathogens whereas shared non pathogenic bacteria can have positive impacts on human health for example transmission of beneficial bacteria can be protective against pathogens and reduce the risk of developing allergies in young children jatzlauk et al 2017 peccia and kwan 2016 prussin and marr 2015 ursell et al 2013 to better understand shared microbiomes sourcetracker a bayesian modeling tool for analyzing 16s rrna gene amplicon sequence data has been used to explore sources of fecal contamination in the natural environment as well as in the built environment by characterizing the shared microbiomes in homes kitchens hospitals and restrooms flores et al 2013 2011 lax et al 2017 ruiz calderon et al 2016 sourcetracker uses characteristic sample types provided by the user to build a library of sequence profiles for each sample type the sample type libraries can then be used to determine the attributable fraction of each sample type in unknown samples distinct from those used to create the library sourcetracker is particularly useful for sources in which there are no or limited single target markers that indicate the presence of the source knights et al 2011 despite the rapid onset of high throughput sequencing and subsequent computational tools such as sourcetracker few studies have investigated household level microbiomes in low and middle income countries lmics bae et al 2019 bauza et al 2019 hospodsky et al 2014 mosites et al 2017 the goal of this study was to apply bacterial community analysis to elucidate pathways of enteric pathogen transmission in 50 rural bangladeshi households specifically we aimed to 1 quantify the overlap in amplicon sequencing variants within and between individual households to distinguish intra household bacterial community exchange 2 quantify the shared microbial community in stored drinking water soil and child and mothers hands using sourcetracker 3 estimate the percentage of human fecal associated bacteria from child and mothers feces in household reservoirs using sourcetracker in an attempt to overcome the limitation of low host specificity exhibited by the single target markers in rural bangladesh boehm et al 2016 and 4 demonstrate the limits to identifying potential pathogens at the genus and species level using 16s rrna gene sequencing in this context 2 methods 2 1 environmental sample collection and processing for this analysis we had the opportunity to combine and sequence samples obtained from two studies conducted under the wash benefits randomized controlled trial in rural bangladesh which measured the impact of water sanitation hygiene and nutrition interventions on child health outcomes luby et al 2018 the environmental samples used herein are a subset of those in two previous manuscripts fuhrmeister et al 2020 2019 and were collected to assess the impact of improved sanitation on pathogens and indicators in the household environment the fecal samples used herein are a subset of those in a forthcoming manuscript on the impact of wash interventions on enteric infections grembi et al n d 50 control arm households sampled as part of the environmental analysis were selected for this study households were chosen based on availability of all environmental sample types child hands ch mother hands mh stored water sw and soil s collected at the same visit table 1 detailed methods on environmental sample collection dna extraction and qpcr are described elsewhere fuhrmeister et al 2019 in brief hand rinse samples were collected by participants placing their left hand or the left hand of their child into 250 ml of distilled water in a sterile whirlpak bag nasco modesto ca hands were massaged from the outside of the bag for 15 s followed by 15 s of shaking the same procedure was repeated with the right hand in the same bag soil samples were collected by scraping the top layer of soil within a 30 30 cm2 stencil from an area as close to the house entrance as possible stored water samples were collected by asking mothers to provide a glass of water as they would give to their child under five samples were transported to the icddr b field laboratory on ice and were processed within 12 h at the field laboratory 50 ml of hand rinse sample and up to 500 ml of stored water was filtered through a 0 45 Œºm ha filter millipore burlington ma filters were treated with 0 5 ml of rnalater and stored at 80 c filter and soil samples were transported to uc berkeley for dna extraction and 16s rrna gene sequencing an additional 25 soil samples were selected from the control households for the source tracking soil library to attempt to decouple the contributions from soil and feces soil samples for the library were selected based on the absence of the human humm2 and animal baccow fecal markers as determined by qpcr however humm2 had a relatively low sensitivity and specificity for human feces in rural bangladesh and it is possible human fecal contamination was missed by this marker boehm et al 2016 soil samples were imported to the u s in accordance with the usda permit ppq 525 2 2 fecal sample collection and processing 25 maternal fecal mf and 25 child fecal cf samples were obtained from households enrolled in the control and combined water sanitation and hygiene arms of wash benefits maternal and child fecal samples were not from the same households as those used for environmental analysis because fecal samples obtained for the enteric infection study grembi et al n d sampled different households than were sampled for the environmental analyses maternal fecal samples were collected during pregnancy mothers were instructed to collect their feces in sterile fecal collection containers and place the containers on ice in the evening before or morning of collection by field staff field staff transported fecal specimens on dry ice to the field laboratory child feces were collected on follow up visits when children were between 13 and 19 months old using the same procedures specimens were stored at 80 c until extraction dna was extracted from fecal samples using the qiaamp fast dna stool mini kit qiagen germantown md with an additional bead beating step a blank sample was included in each round of extraction nucleic acid extract was transported on dry ice to stanford university and then to uc berkeley 2 3 16s rrna gene sequencing library preparation and sequencing was performed at the vincent j coates genomics sequencing laboratory at uc berkeley the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified using 515f and 806r primers samples were pooled and sequenced on two miseq runs yielding paired end 250 bp reads a mock community dna standard zymo research irvine ca was included on each miseq run approximately 13 million total reads were obtained from run one and 14 million reads from run two an average of 50 460 reads per sample were obtained from child hands 50 595 from mother hands 87 160 from stored water 89 514 from soil 112 142 from child feces and 117 675 from mother feces 2 4 data analysis forward and reverse reads were processed using the dada2 pipeline callahan et al 2016 reads were truncated to 180 nucleotides after which the quality score dropped significantly the error rate was determined from sample reads and samples were denoised using the learned error model paired end reads were merged to yield 250 bp sequences and chimeras were removed on average 79 and 76 of the input reads from runs one and two remained after quality filtering merging forward and reverse reads and chimera removal taxonomy was assigned in dada2 using a na√Øve bayes classifier that was trained on the silva v132 database wang et al 2007 yilmaz et al 2014 species level identification was based on 100 identity between the reference database and amplicon sequence variants asvs edgar 2018b for pathogen specific analyses we filtered asvs at the genus and species level to bacterial pathogens associated with moderate to severe diarrhea in bangladesh escherichia coli aeromonas hydrophila campylobacter jejuni vibrio cholera and salmonella enterica kotloff et al 2013 we included asvs that matched multiple species if one of those was a pathogen we omitted asvs that were classified to the above genera but were assigned species that do not contain enteric pathogens data were then analyzed using phyloseq version 1 24 2 in r version 3 5 0 mcmurdie and holmes 2013 a subset of samples was spiked with pseudomonas syringae pv phaseolicola pph6 to estimate extraction efficiency in previous work fuhrmeister et al 2019 this asv was removed from all samples that were spiked we also removed all asvs associated with the eukaryotic organelles chloroplasts and mitochondria 30 600 asvs after organelle removal in total 6600 asvs were found on child hands 6300 asvs on mother hands 9300 asvs in stored water 12 300 asvs in soil 700 asvs in child feces and 1100 asvs in mother feces asv abundance was normalized using the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation huber et al 2002 beta diversity was analyzed via pcoa using bray curtis dissimilarity and variables contributing to differences between communities were identified with permanova using adonis in the vegan package for r oksanen et al 2019 for all samples we investigated the association between bray curtis dissimilarity and sample type overlapping asvs identical asvs within the same household versus between different households were determined by identifying the number of identical asvs present in each sample type within the same household and in different households to determine if the mean number of asvs overlapping within and between households was significantly different we used a bootstrap method efron and tibshirani 1993 the average number of asvs matching between households in the real dataset was compared to the average number of asvs matching in a randomly generated dataset generated by randomizing household id numbers 10 000 times for each iteration we calculated a test statistic which was the difference in the means between the number of asvs matching in the same households in the real dataset and the number of asvs matching between households in the randomly generated dataset statistical significance was determined depending on whether zero was included in the distribution of the test statistic at specified alpha values 0 05 and 0 0083 the latter alpha value was adjusted to correct for multiple comparisons ch and mh ch and sw ch and s mh and sw mh and s and sw and s using the bonferroni correction abdi 2007 to estimate the association between bacterial communities in different reservoirs and feces we used sourcetracker2 in python version 3 7 0 knights et al 2011 sourcetracker2 was run with default parameters and one by one each environmental sample type was designated as a sink with all other environmental sample types and feces designated as sources fecal samples were used as sources for all models but in each run the reservoir of interest was removed from the source library and designated as a sink for example to investigate source associated asvs on child hands feces mother hands stored water and soil were specified as sources and child hands was designated as the sink we included all reservoirs in the source tracker analysis for consistency although some pairs do not represent realistic scenarios e g the percentage of asvs in soil sourced from hands student t tests were used to compare the mean percentages assigned to different sources to investigate whether sourcetracker results were driven by low abundance taxa we conducted a sub analysis in which sourcetracker was re run after asvs with an overall mean relative abundance less than 0 001 were removed 30 600 asvs before and 5500 after filtering the source tracking analysis was validated using two approaches in both different percentages of dna from samples of sources child feces mother feces soil and sinks child hands mother hands stored water soil were prepared in the laboratory and then compared to the percentages estimated using sourcetracker all source and sink samples were composites which were prepared by pooling equal masses of dna extract from five individual samples of the same sample type in validation approach one dna extract from each source mother feces child feces and soil was spiked into dna extract for each sink child hands mother hands or stored water to achieve dna concentration percentages of 10 source 90 sink 1 source 99 sink and 0 5 source 99 5 sink in approach two child feces mother feces and soil source samples were combined in different dna concentration percentages from 0 to 80 all validation combinations are shown in table s1 samples used as sources were not included in sourcetracker source libraries 3 results 3 1 quality controls the relative abundance of the zymobiomics mock dna community constituents was within 3 2 between the two runs fig s1 the eight most abundant taxa matched the reference sequences completely extraction blanks for environmental and fecal samples amplified poorly or not at all in pcr and were therefore not included in the pooled library note that the mother hand sample in household 48 was omitted due to poor pcr amplification 3 2 source tracking validation there was good agreement between estimated source contributions and sourcetracker predicted contributions table s1 sourcetracker was sensitive to the lower percentages of source spike in and was able to identify a qualitative difference between 1 and 0 5 i e estimated contribution from 1 was consistently higher than the estimated contribution from 0 5 in the spike in samples when low abundant taxa 0 001 were removed from the sourcetracker analysis the percentage of the spike in samples that was attributed to soil table s2 was lower in the source only samples sourcetracker was able to correctly differentiate the relative contribution of different sources mother feces child feces and soil see supporting information for more details on validation results 3 3 beta diversity sample type explained a significant difference in the bacterial community fig 1 permanova r2 0 27 p 0 001 while samples appear to group based on sample type it should be noted that there were some soil stored water and hand samples that cluster together and a low percentage of the variation was explained by the two axes 21 in fecal samples there was a significant difference in the communities between mothers and children r2 0 22 p 0 001 permanova tests were also performed using the aitchison distance as suggested by gloor et al 2017 r2 values were similar and the difference in bacterial community by sample type was also statistically significant in these models 3 4 intra household asv matching the average 95 ci number of asvs on mother hands child hands and in stored water and soil was 381 337 425 401 352 451 412 362 462 and 698 637 759 respectively there were significantly more asvs on child hands that were identical to mother hands within the same household mean 168 compared to the hands of mothers in other households mean 98 fig 2 the lower bound of the distribution of the test statistic difference in the means between the number of asvs matching in the same households in the real dataset and the number of asvs matching between households in the randomly generated dataset was well above zero 95 ci 51 7 80 2 fig s2 and table s3 the number of identical asvs on mother and child hands and in soil was also significantly greater in the same household compared to other households on average 84 asvs overlapped between mother hands and soil in the same household while approximately 59 asvs from mother hands matched soil from other households similarly an average of 96 asvs matched between child hands and soil within the same households whereas an average of 65 asvs from child hands matched with soil collected from other households the lower bound of the test statistic distribution was above zero for both comparisons 95 ci ch to s 14 9 41 3 mh to s 10 2 35 3 table s3 there were no significant differences in the number of asvs that were identical on mother hands and in stored water on child hands and in stored water and in soil and stored water within and between households correcting for multiple comparisons 3 5 sourcetracker mother and child hands had the highest estimated percentage of associated bacteria of all reservoirs based on sourcetracker results fig 3 on child hands over half of the bacteria on average were associated with mother hands mean 66 0 95 ci 63 0 69 1 child feces and mother feces contributed approximately 1 percent cf 1 2 0 8 1 6 mf 0 9 0 5 1 3 the estimated percentage from soil 5 8 4 2 7 5 was significantly greater than child and mother feces t test p 0 001 for both similarly on mother hands over 50 of the bacterial community was related to child hands on average 61 8 58 0 65 5 although the percentage of fecal associated asvs was low 2 there was a statistically significant difference in the percentage associated with child feces and mother feces cf

the estimated percentage of asvs associated with mother and child feces was less than 0 5 a greater percentage of the bacterial community was associated with hands mh 16 8 12 8 20 8 ch 3 8 2 2 5 4 with a significantly greater percentage associated with mother hands p 0 001 on average 9 6 5 9 13 3 of the microbial community was related to soil which was significantly greater than feces p 0 001 for both however the estimated percentage of asvs associated with mother hands was significantly greater than the estimated percentage associated with soil p 0 01 in soil less than 0 5 of the bacteria were human fecal associated when low abundant taxa were removed the sourcetracker results were similar on mother and child hands fig s3 in stored water the percentage of asvs attributed to unknown sources was higher 88 2 and the percentage attributed to hands was lower 7 9 it should be noted that the interpretation of associated bacteria between reservoirs is shared bacteria however the term shared would be misleading here as association is determined by sourcetracker statistically based on probability rather than direct occurrence 3 6 community constituents sphingomonadaceae was one of the most abundant families on hands in soil and in stored water figs s4 and s5 other abundant bacterial families on hands were common skin and environmental associated bacteria including moraxellaceae micrococcaceae and burkholderiaceae fig s4 moraxellaceae and burkholderiaceae were also abundant families in stored water whereas chitinophagaceae rhodobacteraceae and xanthomonadaceae were abundant in soil fig s5 we were unable to identify pathogens at the species level using 16s rrna gene sequencing of the potentially pathogenic asvs 22 asvs were identified from the genera campylobacter vibrio aeromonas salmonella and escherichia shigella figs s6 and s7 of those 16 were identified to the genus level only four were identified to the species level in which pathogenic species were one of multiple possible species and two were identified to a single genus and species e coli and v cholera the relative abundance of these potential pathogens was low in all sample types 1 we also assigned taxonomy using the rdp database cole et al 2014 and taxonomic classifications of potential pathogen asvs were the same at the genus level the only differences were apparent in asvs classified to multiple species the assigned non pathogenic species varied slightly between databases data not shown 4 discussion the goal of this study was to explore the usefulness of bacterial community analysis via 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing to provide insight into household level transmission pathways of human feces and enteric pathogens we explored the overlap of communities in different sample types within and between households to understand which intra household transmission pathways were most likely to lead to shared asvs we then compared bacterial communities in different household sample types using sourcetracker we also aimed to estimate the relative importance of human feces to the bacterial community in household reservoirs finally we used the taxonomy assigned to asvs to identify potential pathogens that were shared between different sample types within a household at the genus and species level using sourcetracker we determined that the overall contribution of mother and child feces to the microbial communities was 2 on mother hands and child hands and 0 5 in stored water and soil in related previous work fuhrmeister et al 2019 humm2 was present on 20 of hands in 20 of soil and in 4 of stored water samples from 600 study households from the same study site although it is difficult to directly compare these results because presence of humm2 does not have a quantitative value and sourcetracker attributed a very small fraction of bacteria in every sample to feces there are some noteworthy comparisons in fig 3 0 5 of bacteria in stored water was sourced to human feces which is consistent with the very low abundance of humm2 in the single marker study in contrast while 0 5 of bacteria in soil were sourced to feces 20 of soil samples were positive for humm2 soil bacterial communities are more diverse than stored water which could be the reason that despite the higher prevalence of humm2 there was still only a small fraction of the bacteria in soil that were associated with human feces our results are similar to those from a study of the bacterial community on hands of children mothers and fathers in households in the united states shaffer et al 2018 this previous study which also used sourcetracker found that the bacterial community on palms of children mothers and fathers consisted of a median of 1 7 range 0 99 of fecal bacteria they found that 12 of palms had over 25 fecal associated bacteria whereas none of the mother and child hands in our study had more than 10 7 of bacteria sourced to stool it is notable that the percentage of fecal bacteria on hands in our study in a rural low income area with predominately pit latrines for sanitation was not significantly greater than the percentage of fecal bacteria on hands in the high income population although the relative proportion of fecal associated bacteria is similar between studies there is likely a difference in the pathogens present in feces even small amounts of fecal contamination are a health risk if they contain infectious pathogens in previous work hands of mothers and their children were contaminated with pathogenic e coli and host associated markers of fecal contamination in rural bangladesh fuhrmeister et al 2019 the proportion of the microbial community on mother hands that was associated with mother feces was significantly greater than the percentage attributed to child feces mf 1 8 and cf 0 7 p 0 003 this finding was unexpected given that disposal of child feces in bangladesh typically involves caretaker handling of feces islam et al 2018 and it contrasts a recent study which showed child feces was more dominant than adult feces on caregiver and child hands in kibera kenya bauza et al 2019 in our study on child hands which are important because children are more vulnerable to diarrheal illnesses there was no significant difference between the percentage of the bacteria attributed to mother and child feces cf 1 2 and mf 0 9 p value 0 3 3 9 5 8 of the bacteria on hands was soil associated and this contribution was greater than that from feces soil is a common flooring material in rural bangladeshi households and children especially of crawling age make frequent hand contact with soil kwong et al 2016 the importance of the hand soil pathway is also supported by the overlapping asv analysis more bacteria on mother and child hands were identical to bacteria in the soil in their own household compared to soil from other households soil has been shown to be contaminated with many different pathogens in lmics baker et al 2018 pickering et al 2012 including bangladesh boehm et al 2016 fuhrmeister et al 2019 and bacteria in soil can be readily transferred to the hands of children in the same household soil has also been shown to be a main environmental contributor to the bacterial community on caretaker hands in other lmics such as tanzania hospodsky et al 2014 in tanzania the most abundant families of bacteria on caretaker hands were soil associated rhodobacteraceae and nocardioidaceae the most abundant bacteria families in our study on mother hands were skin and environmental associated moraxellaceae followed by skin associated micrococcaceae the highest percentage of bacteria in the stored water microbial community was attributed to bacteria on mother hands aside from the unknown category in bangladesh water is typically collected from shallow tubewells and stored in a kolshi metal container that can be covered or uncovered water is then dispensed by pouring directly into a vessel for drinking or into an intermediary container such as a pitcher or by reaching into the container with a cup which could result in the contamination of source water by mother hands however there was only a borderline significant difference in the number of identical bacteria on hands and in stored water within the same household compared to stored water from other households fig 2 and table s3 a related study among wash benefits households found that the concentration of indicator e coli was higher in stored water compared to source water ercumen et al 2018b although growth of e coli in stored water cannot be ruled out as the mechanism stored drinking water has also been studied using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing in cameroon where the alpha diversity was higher in stored water compared to source water bae et al 2019 the study theorized that the higher alpha diversity in stored water was due to introduction of bacteria from soil humans and air during storage acintobacter a common water related bacterium was one of the most abundant genera in cameroon and in our study from the family moraxellaceae hand to hand transmission between mother and child is an important pathway for the exchange of bacteria looking at the overall microbial community composition mother and child hands were very similar figs 1 and 3 which is unsurprising given that the two matrices can harbor similar skin associated bacteria however there were significantly more identical bacteria on mother and child hands within the same households compared to other households which suggests transfer of bacteria between mothers and children in the same household shared skin microbiomes have also been observed in families in the united states ross et al 2017 song et al 2013 and we recommend including forehead swabs in future research to explicitly account for asvs associated with the skin microbiome as a source shaffer et al 2018 although we identified very few asvs that could be pathogens we demonstrate the potential for pathogenic bacteria if present to be transferred through mother and child hand interactions it should be noted that our analysis was unable to determine directionality or capture sharing via possible intermediaries such as toys fomites between mothers and their children of the potential pathogens we identified almost half of the asvs were from the genera campylobacter which was not a pathogen investigated using targeted analysis qpcr and pcr in related work fuhrmeister et al 2019 but has been detected in children in bangladesh grembi et al n d kotloff et al 2013 platts mills et al 2014 in resource constrained areas where the burden of diarrhea illness is high and there are numerous etiological agents of disease 16s rrna gene could be a useful screening tool prior to selection of pcr targets for example in retrospect pathogenic campylobacter spp would have been an interesting target and we could have made this choice if we had conducted the 16s rrna gene sequencing in advance of selecting qpcr targets however it should be emphasized that it was not possible to identify actual pathogens using 16s rrna gene sequencing for most species only a fraction of strains or subtypes are pathogenic to humans in our analysis the only two asvs identified to the species level that could be potential pathogens were e coli and v cholera both of which have numerous non pathogenic subtypes in addition while dada2 assigns species at 100 identity the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene is not enough to differentiate many strains more genomic context is needed to identify pathogenic strains which is possible with whole genome sequencing metagenomics or qpcr however in order to identify pathogens that are present in low relative abundance in environmental samples considerably higher sequencing depth is required using metagenomics compared to amplicon methods significantly increasing cost additionally assigning species relies on the accuracy of existing databases we found no difference in the taxonomy assigned to potential pathogen asvs at the genus level between silva and rdp but a previous study estimated annotation error rates in these databases to be 17 and 10 respectively edgar 2018a another limitation is that only viable organisms are capable of causing illness and viability cannot be determined from 16s rrna gene sequencing alone therefore results from 16s rrna gene sequencing analysis should be coupled with specific and sensitive pathogen detection methods e g qpcr and culture based methods to determine viability when feasible while we observed quantitative differences in the contribution of varying sources further validation of this approach is needed especially for sources with estimated low percent contributions unlike previous work that used sourcetracker to identify sources of contamination based on threshold values we have included all sourcetracker results in our analysis and have avoided using thresholds for assigning a source in bauza et al a 1 threshold was used as the cut off value to consider samples positive for source fecal contamination or if the source was positive in at least 3 of 5 runs with an average relative standard deviation less than 100 bauza et al 2019 although there is still uncertainty about how sensitive sourcetracker is to small quantities of fecal contamination in varying contexts previous work found that sourcetracker correctly identified fecal sources with as little as 0 025 vol vol of feces in river water in the united states staley et al 2018 however sourcetracker percentages were consistently higher than what was expected based on vol vol ratios staley et al 2018 in our own work validation samples were composed of dna mass ratios post dna extraction making it difficult to compare strategies for determining sensitivity as the amount of dna that can be extracted from specific quantities of feces is unknown and highly variable another inconsistency between validation studies is the composition of the unknown samples complexity of bacterial communities varies by sample type river water hand rinse soil and is likely to impact sourcetracker performance evaluating the sensitivity of sourcetracker in different sample types is important given that low levels of fecal contamination are relevant for public health due to the low infectious doses of pathogens a limitation of this study design is that it relied on repurposed samples originally collected for other related work fuhrmeister et al 2020 2019 and a wash benefits stool study grembi et al n d as a result we were constrained to the environmental sample types collected for the previous work and fecal samples that were not from the same households as the environmental samples in future work we recommend collecting more bacterial reservoirs in the household to include in the analysis for example a high percentage of bacteria in stored water was sourced from unknown sample types did not come from human feces or other environmental sample types a portion of this unknown bacterial community could have been from animal fecal contamination which was not included in our study animal feces from cows goats ducks and chickens is common in rural bangladeshi households and has been associated with increased concentrations of fecal indicator organisms as well as increased prevalence of enteric pathogens ercumen et al 2017 fuhrmeister et al 2019 sampling other microbiomes such as the forehead and mouth could improve the ability to account for more of the bacteria found on hands shaffer et al 2018 and sampling groundwater could improve the accounting for stored water also in our existing analysis of intra household transmission identifying the number of identical asvs does not take into account relative abundance which is included in sourcetracker models therefore minor community members are represented equally with major constituents and the number of asvs could be influenced by sequencing depth which resulted in more asvs in soil than stored water and hands using sourcetracker to investigate transmission pathways is also complicated by the inability to determine directionality for example mother hands and child hands had the highest number of associated asvs but it is unknown what proportion of the bacteria originated from mothers versus children lastly sourcetracker is less able to distinguish sources that have more similar microbial communities bauza et al 2019 staley et al 2018 while the sample types in this study had distinct microbial communities including child and mother feces there was still some overlap and this study only captured some of the factors that may influence the microbial communities this limitation is evident in the low percentage of the variation total of 21 that was explained by axis 1 and 2 in the multidimensional scaling fig 1 bacterial community analysis is a promising approach for understanding pathways of enteric pathogen transmission although we show relatively low proportions of human fecal bacteria in the bacterial community in environmental reservoirs low levels of fecal contamination can still transmit pathogens nonetheless we were able to identify pathways of bacteria transfer between mother and child hands soil and child hands and soil and mother hands at the household level this non targeted approach may be more appropriate to use in lmic settings where sensitivity and specificity of source tracking markers is impacted by the potential sharing of microbial communities between humans and animals even though sharing of microbial communities between humans and animals is also a limitation in differentiating sources using sourcetracker the use of multiple markers as indicators of fecal contamination could be more robust to similarity in source microbial communities than single targets and further exploration is warranted 5 conclusions only a small fraction of the bacterial community in household reservoirs was human fecal associated although low levels of fecal contamination can still pose a health risk the percentage of fecal associated asvs on hands in rural bangladesh was similar to the percentage of fecal associated bacteria found on hands in the us in a previously published study mother and child hands had the highest percentage of associated bacteria and significantly more bacteria were identical between mother and child hands within the same household compared to those from other households in stored water the highest percentage of bacteria from a known source was associated with mother hands the percentage of asvs from unknown sources was high and future work should include more household source types data availability raw sequence reads for

19976,understanding household level transmission pathways of fecal pathogens can provide insight for developing effective strategies to reduce diarrheal illness in low and middle income countries we applied whole bacterial community analysis to investigate pathways of bacterial transmission in 50 rural bangladeshi households sourcetracker was used to quantify the shared microbial community in household reservoirs stored drinking water soil and hands and estimate the percentage of fecal associated bacteria from child and mothers feces in these reservoirs among the reservoirs studied most bacterial transfer occurred between mothers and children s hands and between mothers hands and stored water the relative percentage of human fecal associated bacteria in all household reservoirs was low we also quantified the number of identical amplicon sequence variants within and between individual households to assess bacterial community exchange in the domestic environment intra household sharing of bacteria between mothers and children s hands and between hands and soil was significantly greater than inter household sharing graphical abstract image 1 keywords 16s rrna gene sequencing

environment pathogens can move through environmental reservoirs including flies fomites hands soil food and water providing sufficient quantities of water adequate drinking water treatment sanitation and hygiene wash are the main strategies to block pathogen transmission pathways and reduce the occurrence of diarrheal illnesses recent field trials have investigated the impact of these interventions on diarrhea in children and found limited reductions even with high levels of compliance and no additive benefit of multiple interventions clasen et al 2014 humphrey et al 2019 luby et al 2018 2006 null et al 2018 improving our understanding of the role of environmental reservoirs in enteric pathogen transmission is important especially given the limited effectiveness of wash interventions in the field previous studies investigating environmental pathways of pathogen transmission have largely focused on identifying fecal indicators such as e coli and microbial source tracking markers in household reservoirs such as soil hands stored drinking water and children s toys boehm et al 2016 ercumen et al 2018b 2018a 2017 harris et al 2016 mattioli et al 2013 odagiri et al 2016 pickering et al 2010 2012 2011 schriewer et al 2015 vujcic et al 2014 this approach is useful because it can produce quantitative results for organisms that indicate the presence of fecal contamination however identifying traditional fecal indicators relies on pre specification of single targets bacteria as an indicator of an entire microbial community fecal microbial community in microbial source tracking which aims to distinguish fecal contamination from humans and various animals the use of single host specific targets has proven challenging because host microbiomes vary between individuals and geographically impacting the sensitivity and specificity of assays when applied to populations outside of those used to develop these assays balleste et al 2010 gawler et al 2007 harris et al 2016 jenkins et al 2009 reischer et al 2013 here we aimed to characterize transmission pathways by applying untargeted high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing to whole bacterial communities present in environmental samples new and less expensive sequencing technologies have given rise to the study of a wide variety of microbiomes to understand bacterial transmission in the built environment this research has revealed that microbiomes can be shared between environments fomites people and animals pehrsson et al 2016 song et al 2013 trinh et al 2018 shared microbiota of concern includes pathogens whereas shared non pathogenic bacteria can have positive impacts on human health for example transmission of beneficial bacteria can be protective against pathogens and reduce the risk of developing allergies in young children jatzlauk et al 2017 peccia and kwan 2016 prussin and marr 2015 ursell et al 2013 to better understand shared microbiomes sourcetracker a bayesian modeling tool for analyzing 16s rrna gene amplicon sequence data has been used to explore sources of fecal contamination in the natural environment as well as in the built environment by characterizing the shared microbiomes in homes kitchens hospitals and restrooms flores et al 2013 2011 lax et al 2017 ruiz calderon et al 2016 sourcetracker uses characteristic sample types provided by the user to build a library of sequence profiles for each sample type the sample type libraries can then be used to determine the attributable fraction of each sample type in unknown samples distinct from those used to create the library sourcetracker is particularly useful for sources in which there are no or limited single target markers that indicate the presence of the source knights et al 2011 despite the rapid onset of high throughput sequencing and subsequent computational tools such as sourcetracker few studies have investigated household level microbiomes in low and middle income countries lmics bae et al 2019 bauza et al 2019 hospodsky et al 2014 mosites et al 2017 the goal of this study was to apply bacterial community analysis to elucidate pathways of enteric pathogen transmission in 50 rural bangladeshi households specifically we aimed to 1 quantify the overlap in amplicon sequencing variants within and between individual households to distinguish intra household bacterial community exchange 2 quantify the shared microbial community in stored drinking water soil and child and mothers hands using sourcetracker 3 estimate the percentage of human fecal associated bacteria from child and mothers feces in household reservoirs using sourcetracker in an attempt to overcome the limitation of low host specificity exhibited by the single target markers in rural bangladesh boehm et al 2016 and 4 demonstrate the limits to identifying potential pathogens at the genus and species level using 16s rrna gene sequencing in this context 2 methods 2 1 environmental sample collection and processing for this analysis we had the opportunity to combine and sequence samples obtained from two studies conducted under the wash benefits randomized controlled trial in rural bangladesh which measured the impact of water sanitation hygiene and nutrition interventions on child health outcomes luby et al 2018 the environmental samples used herein are a subset of those in two previous manuscripts fuhrmeister et al 2020 2019 and were collected to assess the impact of improved sanitation on pathogens and indicators in the household environment the fecal samples used herein are a subset of those in a forthcoming manuscript on the impact of wash interventions on enteric infections grembi et al n d 50 control arm households sampled as part of the environmental analysis were selected for this study households were chosen based on availability of all environmental sample types child hands ch mother hands mh stored water sw and soil s collected at the same visit table 1 detailed methods on environmental sample collection dna extraction and qpcr are described elsewhere fuhrmeister et al 2019 in brief hand rinse samples were collected by participants placing their left hand or the left hand of their child into 250 ml of distilled water in a sterile whirlpak bag nasco modesto ca hands were massaged from the outside of the bag for 15 s followed by 15 s of shaking the same procedure was repeated with the right hand in the same bag soil samples were collected by scraping the top layer of soil within a 30 30 cm2 stencil from an area as close to the house entrance as possible stored water samples were collected by asking mothers to provide a glass of water as they would give to their child under five samples were transported to the icddr b field laboratory on ice and were processed within 12 h at the field laboratory 50 ml of hand rinse sample and up to 500 ml of stored water was filtered through a 0 45 Œºm ha filter millipore burlington ma filters were treated with 0 5 ml of rnalater and stored at 80 c filter and soil samples were transported to uc berkeley for dna extraction and 16s rrna gene sequencing an additional 25 soil samples were selected from the control households for the source tracking soil library to attempt to decouple the contributions from soil and feces soil samples for the library were selected based on the absence of the human humm2 and animal baccow fecal markers as determined by qpcr however humm2 had a relatively low sensitivity and specificity for human feces in rural bangladesh and it is possible human fecal contamination was missed by this marker boehm et al 2016 soil samples were imported to the u s in accordance with the usda permit ppq 525 2 2 fecal sample collection and processing 25 maternal fecal mf and 25 child fecal cf samples were obtained from households enrolled in the control and combined water sanitation and hygiene arms of wash benefits maternal and child fecal samples were not from the same households as those used for environmental analysis because fecal samples obtained for the enteric infection study grembi et al n d sampled different households than were sampled for the environmental analyses maternal fecal samples were collected during pregnancy mothers were instructed to collect their feces in sterile fecal collection containers and place the containers on ice in the evening before or morning of collection by field staff field staff transported fecal specimens on dry ice to the field laboratory child feces were collected on follow up visits when children were between 13 and 19 months old using the same procedures specimens were stored at 80 c until extraction dna was extracted from fecal samples using the qiaamp fast dna stool mini kit qiagen germantown md with an additional bead beating step a blank sample was included in each round of extraction nucleic acid extract was transported on dry ice to stanford university and then to uc berkeley 2 3 16s rrna gene sequencing library preparation and sequencing was performed at the vincent j coates genomics sequencing laboratory at uc berkeley the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified using 515f and 806r primers samples were pooled and sequenced on two miseq runs yielding paired end 250 bp reads a mock community dna standard zymo research irvine ca was included on each miseq run approximately 13 million total reads were obtained from run one and 14 million reads from run two an average of 50 460 reads per sample were obtained from child hands 50 595 from mother hands 87 160 from stored water 89 514 from soil 112 142 from child feces and 117 675 from mother feces 2 4 data analysis forward and reverse reads were processed using the dada2 pipeline callahan et al 2016 reads were truncated to 180 nucleotides after which the quality score dropped significantly the error rate was determined from sample reads and samples were denoised using the learned error model paired end reads were merged to yield 250 bp sequences and chimeras were removed on average 79 and 76 of the input reads from runs one and two remained after quality filtering merging forward and reverse reads and chimera removal taxonomy was assigned in dada2 using a na√Øve bayes classifier that was trained on the silva v132 database wang et al 2007 yilmaz et al 2014 species level identification was based on 100 identity between the reference database and amplicon sequence variants asvs edgar 2018b for pathogen specific analyses we filtered asvs at the genus and species level to bacterial pathogens associated with moderate to severe diarrhea in bangladesh escherichia coli aeromonas hydrophila campylobacter jejuni vibrio cholera and salmonella enterica kotloff et al 2013 we included asvs that matched multiple species if one of those was a pathogen we omitted asvs that were classified to the above genera but were assigned species that do not contain enteric pathogens data were then analyzed using phyloseq version 1 24 2 in r version 3 5 0 mcmurdie and holmes 2013 a subset of samples was spiked with pseudomonas syringae pv phaseolicola pph6 to estimate extraction efficiency in previous work fuhrmeister et al 2019 this asv was removed from all samples that were spiked we also removed all asvs associated with the eukaryotic organelles chloroplasts and mitochondria 30 600 asvs after organelle removal in total 6600 asvs were found on child hands 6300 asvs on mother hands 9300 asvs in stored water 12 300 asvs in soil 700 asvs in child feces and 1100 asvs in mother feces asv abundance was normalized using the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation huber et al 2002 beta diversity was analyzed via pcoa using bray curtis dissimilarity and variables contributing to differences between communities were identified with permanova using adonis in the vegan package for r oksanen et al 2019 for all samples we investigated the association between bray curtis dissimilarity and sample type overlapping asvs identical asvs within the same household versus between different households were determined by identifying the number of identical asvs present in each sample type within the same household and in different households to determine if the mean number of asvs overlapping within and between households was significantly different we used a bootstrap method efron and tibshirani 1993 the average number of asvs matching between households in the real dataset was compared to the average number of asvs matching in a randomly generated dataset generated by randomizing household id numbers 10 000 times for each iteration we calculated a test statistic which was the difference in the means between the number of asvs matching in the same households in the real dataset and the number of asvs matching between households in the randomly generated dataset statistical significance was determined depending on whether zero was included in the distribution of the test statistic at specified alpha values 0 05 and 0 0083 the latter alpha value was adjusted to correct for multiple comparisons ch and mh ch and sw ch and s mh and sw mh and s and sw and s using the bonferroni correction abdi 2007 to estimate the association between bacterial communities in different reservoirs and feces we used sourcetracker2 in python version 3 7 0 knights et al 2011 sourcetracker2 was run with default parameters and one by one each environmental sample type was designated as a sink with all other environmental sample types and feces designated as sources fecal samples were used as sources for all models but in each run the reservoir of interest was removed from the source library and designated as a sink for example to investigate source associated asvs on child hands feces mother hands stored water and soil were specified as sources and child hands was designated as the sink we included all reservoirs in the source tracker analysis for consistency although some pairs do not represent realistic scenarios e g the percentage of asvs in soil sourced from hands student t tests were used to compare the mean percentages assigned to different sources to investigate whether sourcetracker results were driven by low abundance taxa we conducted a sub analysis in which sourcetracker was re run after asvs with an overall mean relative abundance less than 0 001 were removed 30 600 asvs before and 5500 after filtering the source tracking analysis was validated using two approaches in both different percentages of dna from samples of sources child feces mother feces soil and sinks child hands mother hands stored water soil were prepared in the laboratory and then compared to the percentages estimated using sourcetracker all source and sink samples were composites which were prepared by pooling equal masses of dna extract from five individual samples of the same sample type in validation approach one dna extract from each source mother feces child feces and soil was spiked into dna extract for each sink child hands mother hands or stored water to achieve dna concentration percentages of 10 source 90 sink 1 source 99 sink and 0 5 source 99 5 sink in approach two child feces mother feces and soil source samples were combined in different dna concentration percentages from 0 to 80 all validation combinations are shown in table s1 samples used as sources were not included in sourcetracker source libraries 3 results 3 1 quality controls the relative abundance of the zymobiomics mock dna community constituents was within 3 2 between the two runs fig s1 the eight most abundant taxa matched the reference sequences completely extraction blanks for environmental and fecal samples amplified poorly or not at all in pcr and were therefore not included in the pooled library note that the mother hand sample in household 48 was omitted due to poor pcr amplification 3 2 source tracking validation there was good agreement between estimated source contributions and sourcetracker predicted contributions table s1 sourcetracker was sensitive to the lower percentages of source spike in and was able to identify a qualitative difference between 1 and 0 5 i e estimated contribution from 1 was consistently higher than the estimated contribution from 0 5 in the spike in samples when low abundant taxa 0 001 were removed from the sourcetracker analysis the percentage of the spike in samples that was attributed to soil table s2 was lower in the source only samples sourcetracker was able to correctly differentiate the relative contribution of different sources mother feces child feces and soil see supporting information for more details on validation results 3 3 beta diversity sample type explained a significant difference in the bacterial community fig 1 permanova r2 0 27 p 0 001 while samples appear to group based on sample type it should be noted that there were some soil stored water and hand samples that cluster together and a low percentage of the variation was explained by the two axes 21 in fecal samples there was a significant difference in the communities between mothers and children r2 0 22 p 0 001 permanova tests were also performed using the aitchison distance as suggested by gloor et al 2017 r2 values were similar and the difference in bacterial community by sample type was also statistically significant in these models 3 4 intra household asv matching the average 95 ci number of asvs on mother hands child hands and in stored water and soil was 381 337 425 401 352 451 412 362 462 and 698 637 759 respectively there were significantly more asvs on child hands that were identical to mother hands within the same household mean 168 compared to the hands of mothers in other households mean 98 fig 2 the lower bound of the distribution of the test statistic difference in the means between the number of asvs matching in the same households in the real dataset and the number of asvs matching between households in the randomly generated dataset was well above zero 95 ci 51 7 80 2 fig s2 and table s3 the number of identical asvs on mother and child hands and in soil was also significantly greater in the same household compared to other households on average 84 asvs overlapped between mother hands and soil in the same household while approximately 59 asvs from mother hands matched soil from other households similarly an average of 96 asvs matched between child hands and soil within the same households whereas an average of 65 asvs from child hands matched with soil collected from other households the lower bound of the test statistic distribution was above zero for both comparisons 95 ci ch to s 14 9 41 3 mh to s 10 2 35 3 table s3 there were no significant differences in the number of asvs that were identical on mother hands and in stored water on child hands and in stored water and in soil and stored water within and between households correcting for multiple comparisons 3 5 sourcetracker mother and child hands had the highest estimated percentage of associated bacteria of all reservoirs based on sourcetracker results fig 3 on child hands over half of the bacteria on average were associated with mother hands mean 66 0 95 ci 63 0 69 1 child feces and mother feces contributed approximately 1 percent cf 1 2 0 8 1 6 mf 0 9 0 5 1 3 the estimated

the estimated percentage of asvs associated with mother and child feces was less than 0 5 a greater percentage of the bacterial community was associated with hands mh 16 8 12 8 20 8 ch 3 8 2 2 5 4 with a significantly greater percentage associated with mother hands p 0 001 on average 9 6 5 9 13 3 of the microbial community was related to soil which was significantly greater than feces p 0 001 for both however the estimated percentage of asvs associated with mother hands was significantly greater than the estimated percentage associated with soil p 0 01 in soil less than 0 5 of the bacteria were human fecal associated when low abundant taxa were removed the sourcetracker results were similar on mother and child hands fig s3 in stored water the percentage of asvs attributed to unknown sources was higher 88 2 and the percentage attributed to hands was lower 7 9 it should be noted that the interpretation of associated bacteria between reservoirs is shared bacteria however the term shared would be misleading here as association is determined by sourcetracker statistically based on probability rather than direct occurrence 3 6 community constituents sphingomonadaceae was one of the most abundant families on hands in soil and in stored water figs s4 and s5 other abundant bacterial families on hands were common skin and environmental associated bacteria including moraxellaceae micrococcaceae and burkholderiaceae fig s4 moraxellaceae and burkholderiaceae were also abundant families in stored water whereas chitinophagaceae rhodobacteraceae and xanthomonadaceae were abundant in soil fig s5 we were unable to identify pathogens at the species level using 16s rrna gene sequencing of the potentially pathogenic asvs 22 asvs were identified from the genera campylobacter vibrio aeromonas salmonella and escherichia shigella figs s6 and s7 of those 16 were identified to the genus level only four were identified to the species level in which pathogenic species were one of multiple possible species and two were identified to a single genus and species e coli and v cholera the relative abundance of these potential pathogens was low in all sample types 1 we also assigned taxonomy using the rdp database cole et al 2014 and taxonomic classifications of potential pathogen asvs were the same at the genus level the only differences were apparent in asvs classified to multiple species the assigned non pathogenic species varied slightly between databases data not shown 4 discussion the goal of this study was to explore the usefulness of bacterial community analysis via 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing to provide insight into household level transmission pathways of human feces and enteric pathogens we explored the overlap of communities in different sample types within and between households to understand which intra household transmission pathways were most likely to lead to shared asvs we then compared bacterial communities in different household sample types using sourcetracker we also aimed to estimate the relative importance of human feces to the bacterial community in household reservoirs finally we used the taxonomy assigned to asvs to identify potential pathogens that were shared between different sample types within a household at the genus and species level using sourcetracker we determined that the overall contribution of mother and child feces to the microbial communities was 2 on mother hands and child hands and 0 5 in stored water and soil in related previous work fuhrmeister et al 2019 humm2 was present on 20 of hands in 20 of soil and in 4 of stored water samples from 600 study households from the same study site although it is difficult to directly compare these results because presence of humm2 does not have a quantitative value and sourcetracker attributed a very small fraction of bacteria in every sample to feces there are some noteworthy comparisons in fig 3 0 5 of bacteria in stored water was sourced to human feces which is consistent with the very low abundance of humm2 in the single marker study in contrast while 0 5 of bacteria in soil were sourced to feces 20 of soil samples were positive for humm2 soil bacterial communities are more diverse than stored water which could be the reason that despite the higher prevalence of humm2 there was still only a small fraction of the bacteria in soil that were associated with human feces our results are similar to those from a study of the bacterial community on hands of children mothers and fathers in households in the united states shaffer et al 2018 this previous study which also used sourcetracker found that the bacterial community on palms of children mothers and fathers consisted of a median of 1 7 range 0 99 of fecal bacteria they found that 12 of palms had over 25 fecal associated bacteria whereas none of the mother and child hands in our study had more than 10 7 of bacteria sourced to stool it is notable that the percentage of fecal bacteria on hands in our study in a rural low income area with predominately pit latrines for sanitation was not significantly greater than the percentage of fecal bacteria on hands in the high income population although the relative proportion of fecal associated bacteria is similar between studies there is likely a difference in the pathogens present in feces even small amounts of fecal contamination are a health risk if they contain infectious pathogens in previous work hands of mothers and their children were contaminated with pathogenic e coli and host associated markers of fecal contamination in rural bangladesh fuhrmeister et al 2019 the proportion of the microbial community on mother hands that was associated with mother feces was significantly greater than the percentage attributed to child feces mf 1 8 and cf 0 7 p 0 003 this finding was unexpected given that disposal of child feces in bangladesh typically involves caretaker handling of feces islam et al 2018 and it contrasts a recent study which showed child feces was more dominant than adult feces on caregiver and child hands in kibera kenya bauza et al 2019 in our study on child hands which are important because children are more vulnerable to diarrheal illnesses there was no significant difference between the percentage of the bacteria attributed to mother and child feces cf 1 2 and mf 0 9 p value 0 3 3 9 5 8 of the bacteria on hands was soil associated and this contribution was greater than that from feces soil is a common flooring material in rural bangladeshi households and children especially of crawling age make frequent hand contact with soil kwong et al 2016 the importance of the hand soil pathway is also supported by the overlapping asv analysis more bacteria on mother and child hands were identical to bacteria in the soil in their own household compared to soil from other households soil has been shown to be contaminated with many different pathogens in lmics baker et al 2018 pickering et al 2012 including bangladesh boehm et al 2016 fuhrmeister et al 2019 and bacteria in soil can be readily transferred to the hands of children in the same household soil has also been shown to be a main environmental contributor to the bacterial community on caretaker hands in other lmics such as tanzania hospodsky et al 2014 in tanzania the most abundant families of bacteria on caretaker hands were soil associated rhodobacteraceae and nocardioidaceae the most abundant bacteria families in our study on mother hands were skin and environmental associated moraxellaceae followed by skin associated micrococcaceae the highest percentage of bacteria in the stored water microbial community was attributed to bacteria on mother hands aside from the unknown category in bangladesh water is typically collected from shallow tubewells and stored in a kolshi metal container that can be covered or uncovered water is then dispensed by pouring directly into a vessel for drinking or into an intermediary container such as a pitcher or by reaching into the container with a cup which could result in the contamination of source water by mother hands however there was only a borderline significant difference in the number of identical bacteria on hands and in stored water within the same household compared to stored water from other households fig 2 and table s3 a related study among wash benefits households found that the concentration of indicator e coli was higher in stored water compared to source water ercumen et al 2018b although growth of e coli in stored water cannot be ruled out as the mechanism stored drinking water has also been studied using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing in cameroon where the alpha diversity was higher in stored water compared to source water bae et al 2019 the study theorized that the higher alpha diversity in stored water was due to introduction of bacteria from soil humans and air during storage acintobacter a common water related bacterium was one of the most abundant genera in cameroon and in our study from the family moraxellaceae hand to hand transmission between mother and child is an important pathway for the exchange of bacteria looking at the overall microbial community composition mother and child hands were very similar figs 1 and 3 which is unsurprising given that the two matrices can harbor similar skin associated bacteria however there were significantly more identical bacteria on mother and child hands within the same households compared to other households which suggests transfer of bacteria between mothers and children in the same household shared skin microbiomes have also been observed in families in the united states ross et al 2017 song et al 2013 and we recommend including forehead swabs in future research to explicitly account for asvs associated with the skin microbiome as a source shaffer et al 2018 although we identified very few asvs that could be pathogens we demonstrate the potential for pathogenic bacteria if present to be transferred through mother and child hand interactions it should be noted that our analysis was unable to determine directionality or capture sharing via possible intermediaries such as toys fomites between mothers and their children of the potential pathogens we identified almost half of the asvs were from the genera campylobacter which was not a pathogen investigated using targeted analysis qpcr and pcr in related work fuhrmeister et al 2019 but has been detected in children in bangladesh grembi et al n d kotloff et al 2013 platts mills et al 2014 in resource constrained areas where the burden of diarrhea illness is high and there are numerous etiological agents of disease 16s rrna gene could be a useful screening tool prior to selection of pcr targets for example in retrospect pathogenic campylobacter spp would have been an interesting target and we could have made this choice if we had conducted the 16s rrna gene sequencing in advance of selecting qpcr targets however it should be emphasized that it was not possible to identify actual pathogens using 16s rrna gene sequencing for most species only a fraction of strains or subtypes are pathogenic to humans in our analysis the only two asvs identified to the species level that could be potential pathogens were e coli and v cholera both of which have numerous non pathogenic subtypes in addition while dada2 assigns species at 100 identity the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene is not enough to differentiate many strains more genomic context is needed to identify pathogenic strains which is possible with whole genome sequencing metagenomics or qpcr however in order to identify pathogens that are present in low relative abundance in environmental samples considerably higher sequencing depth is required using metagenomics compared to amplicon methods significantly increasing cost additionally assigning species relies on the accuracy of existing databases we found no difference in the taxonomy assigned to potential pathogen asvs at the genus level between silva and rdp but a previous study estimated annotation error rates in these databases to be 17 and 10 respectively edgar 2018a another limitation is that only viable organisms are capable of causing illness and viability cannot be determined from 16s rrna gene sequencing alone therefore results from 16s rrna gene sequencing analysis should be coupled with specific and sensitive pathogen detection methods e g qpcr and culture based methods to determine viability when feasible while we observed quantitative differences in the contribution of varying sources further validation of this approach is needed especially for sources with estimated low percent contributions unlike previous work that used sourcetracker to identify sources of contamination based on threshold values we have included all sourcetracker results in our analysis and have avoided using thresholds for assigning a source in bauza et al a 1 threshold was used as the cut off value to consider samples positive for source fecal contamination or if the source was positive in at least 3 of 5 runs with an average relative standard deviation less than 100 bauza et al 2019 although there is still uncertainty about how sensitive sourcetracker is to small quantities of fecal contamination in varying contexts previous work found that sourcetracker correctly identified fecal sources with as little as 0 025 vol vol of feces in river water in the united states staley et al 2018 however sourcetracker percentages were consistently higher than what was expected based on vol vol ratios staley et al 2018 in our own work validation samples were composed of dna mass ratios post dna extraction making it difficult to compare strategies for determining sensitivity as the amount of dna that can be extracted from specific quantities of feces is unknown and highly variable another inconsistency between validation studies is the composition of the unknown samples complexity of bacterial communities varies by sample type river water hand rinse soil and is likely to impact sourcetracker performance evaluating the sensitivity of sourcetracker in different sample types is important given that low levels of fecal contamination are relevant for public health due to the low infectious doses of pathogens a limitation of this study design is that it relied on repurposed samples originally collected for other related work fuhrmeister et al 2020 2019 and a wash benefits stool study grembi et al n d as a result we were constrained to the environmental sample types collected for the previous work and fecal samples that were not from the same households as the environmental samples in future work we recommend collecting more bacterial reservoirs in the household to include in the analysis for example a high percentage of bacteria in stored water was sourced from unknown sample types did not come from human feces or other environmental sample types a portion of this unknown bacterial community could have been from animal fecal contamination which was not included in our study animal feces from cows goats ducks and chickens is common in rural bangladeshi households and has been associated with increased concentrations of fecal indicator organisms as well as increased prevalence of enteric pathogens ercumen et al 2017 fuhrmeister et al 2019 sampling other microbiomes such as the forehead and mouth could improve the ability to account for more of the bacteria found on hands shaffer et al 2018 and sampling groundwater could improve the accounting for stored water also in our existing analysis of intra household transmission identifying the number of identical asvs does not take into account relative abundance which is included in sourcetracker models therefore minor community members are represented equally with major constituents and the number of asvs could be influenced by sequencing depth which resulted in more asvs in soil than stored water and hands using sourcetracker to investigate transmission pathways is also complicated by the inability to determine directionality for example mother hands and child hands had the highest number of associated asvs but it is unknown what proportion of the bacteria originated from mothers versus children lastly sourcetracker is less able to distinguish sources that have more similar microbial communities bauza et al 2019 staley et al 2018 while the sample types in this study had distinct microbial communities including child and mother feces there was still some overlap and this study only captured some of the factors that may influence the microbial communities this limitation is evident in the low percentage of the variation total of 21 that was explained by axis 1 and 2 in the multidimensional scaling fig 1 bacterial community analysis is a promising approach for understanding pathways of enteric pathogen transmission although we show relatively low proportions of human fecal bacteria in the bacterial community in environmental reservoirs low levels of fecal contamination can still transmit pathogens nonetheless we were able to identify pathways of bacteria transfer between mother and child hands soil and child hands and soil and mother hands at the household level this non targeted approach may be more appropriate to use in lmic settings where sensitivity and specificity of source tracking markers is impacted by the potential sharing of microbial communities between humans and animals even though sharing of microbial communities between humans and animals is also a limitation in differentiating sources using sourcetracker the use of multiple markers as indicators of fecal contamination could be more robust to similarity in source microbial communities than single targets and further exploration is warranted 5 conclusions only a small fraction of the bacterial community in household reservoirs was human fecal associated although low levels of fecal contamination can still pose a health risk the percentage of fecal associated asvs on hands in rural bangladesh was similar to the percentage of fecal associated bacteria found on hands in the us in a previously published study mother and child hands had the highest percentage of associated bacteria and significantly more bacteria were identical between mother and child hands within the same household compared to those from other households in stored water the highest percentage of bacteria from a known source was associated with mother hands the percentage of asvs from unknown sources was high and future work should include more household source types data availability raw sequence reads for

19977,sensing nitrite in situ in wastewater treatment processes could greatly simplify process control especially during treatment of high strength nitrogen wastewaters such as digester supernatant or as in our case urine the two technologies available today i e an on line nitrite analyzer and a spectrophotometric sensor have strong limitations such as sample preparation cost of ownership and strong interferences a promising alternative is the amperometric measurement of nitrite which we assessed in this study we investigated the sensor in a urine nitrification reactor and in ex situ experiments based on theoretical calculations as well as a practical approach we determined that the critical nitrite concentrations for nitrite oxidizing bacteria lie between 12 and 30 mgn l at ph 6 to 6 8 consequently we decided that the sensor should be able to reliably measure concentrations up to 50 mgn l which is about double the value of the critical nitrite concentration we found that the influences of various ambient conditions such as temperature ph electric conductivity and aeration rate in the ranges expected in urine nitrification systems are negligible for low nitrite concentrations as expected in municipal wastewater treatment the tested amperometric nitrite sensor was not sufficiently sensitive nevertheless the sensor delivered reliable measurements for nitrite concentrations of 5 50 mgn l or higher this means that the amperometric nitrite sensor allows detection of critical nitrite concentrations without difficulty in high strength nitrogen conversion processes such as the nitrification of human urine graphical abstract image 1 keywords continuous measurement in situ measurement electrochemical measurement amperometric sensor critical nitrite concentration nitrite measurement 1 introduction in many wastewater treatment processes maintaining low nitrite concentrations is crucial for several reasons first the effluent discharge limit for the nitrite concentration must be met in switzerland it lies at 0 3 mgn l gujer 2006 due to its toxicity for fish kroupova et al 2005 second high nitrite concentrations must be avoided in order to prevent the formation of harmful gases such as nitric oxide and nitrous oxide during nitrification and denitrification schreiber et al 2012 third nitrite is an intermediate product in nitrification and exists in equilibrium with its protonated form free nitrous acid hno2 which can inhibit bacteria in wastewater treatment zhou et al 2011 in many processes such as conventional nitrification for example nitrification of urine for fertilizer recovery such inhibition should be avoided indeed once nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob are inhibited by nitrite the compound accumulates faster and nob are inhibited even more strongly which can be detrimental for processes relying on complete nitrification of ammonia over nitrite to nitrate udert and w√§chter 2012 in a number of specialized processes such as sharon anammox volcke et al 2006 daemon wett et al 2007 and oland kuai and verstraete 1998 it is paramount that nob growth is limited the presence of nitrite can cause such growth in turn leading to reduced energy and electron donor efficiency of these processes thus nitrite is a key variable for optimal operation of many nitrifying processes regardless of the desirability of nob activity an on line nitrite measurement would be an ideal tool to detect detrimental nitrite concentration levels and to prompt timely for corrective actions to our knowledge two principles are available today to measure nitrite on line in wastewater treatment one is based on a colorimetric measurement i e on line nitrite analyzers e g nitrite analyzer liquiline system ca80no endress hauser reinach switzerland sa9101 skalar analytical b v breda netherlands this technique shows no significant drift and has a high sensitivity and specificity however the cost of ownership ellram 1995 of an on line analyzer is typically high due to high hardware costs and intensive maintenance requirements ma≈°iƒá et al 2015 rieger et al 2008 furthermore it is an ex situ measurement and needs sampling preparation rieger et al 2004 the complexity and costs for such automated sampling preparation can be an issue especially for small treatment plants another continuous nitrite measurement is based on the light absorbance measurement principle th√ºrlimann et al 2017 this is a spectrophotometric measurement i e through measurement of light absorbance at multiple wavelengths and makes use of the fact that many chemical compounds including nitrite absorb light differently at different wavelengths robust devices built around this principle are available commercially importantly these measurements can be obtained in situ and do not require sensitive sample preparation steps drolc and vrtov≈°ek 2010 this type of sensors is sensitive to a variety of inorganic and organic compounds so that one can use a single device to measure multiple variables at once unfortunately this also means that the absorbance measurements lack specificity this in turn challenges accurate calibration and induces signal drift when the mixture of non target components that absorb light e g organic matter or solids deviates from the mixtures observed during sensor calibration such a phenomenon is often described as a change of the background spectrum th√ºrlimann et al 2019 while sensor drift can be compensated by fault tolerant control schemes deshpande et al 2009 th√ºrlimann et al 2019 it is generally considered desirable to avoid sensor drift entirely the amperometric nitrite measurement which we assessed in this study is a promising alternative that may lead to the construction of a drift free on line nitrite sensor with this method nitrite concentrations in aqueous solutions are measured electrochemically the sensor consists of three electrodes a reference electrode a working electrode in our case the anode and a counter electrode in our case the cathode fig 1 helm et al 2010 the operation mode is potentiostatic which means that a constant potential is applied between the reference and the working electrode when a chemical substance reacts at the working electrode e g nitrite is oxidized at the anode electrons are transferred between the substance and the working electrode when at the same time a chemical substance reacts at the counter electrode e g protons are reduced to hydrogen at the cathode an electric current is generated between the working and counter electrode hamann and vielstich 2005 this current can be set in correlation to the concentration of the analyte i e the substance which reacts at the working electrode in contrast to the potentiometric measuring principle which is based on a passive registration of the potential difference between two electrodes schwedt et al 2016 and is applied in ion selective electrode ise sensors for ammonium or nitrate amperometric measurement is based on actively controlling the potential at the working electrode and measuring the resulting electric current the amperometric measuring principle has been studied and commercialized and normally requires a membrane or some other diffusion barrier helm et al 2010 in order to achieve selectivity amperometric sensors are available e g for dissolved oxygen clark electrode hamann and vielstich 2005 ozone e g 9185 sc ozone amperometric analyzer hach lange gmbh rheineck switzerland helm et al 2010 and free chlorine e g analog free chlorine sensor ccs51 endress hauser reinach switzerland according to the review of helm et al 2010 temperature influences amperometric measurements since it affects the rate of diffusion with temperature the width of the diffusion layer decreases and the diffusion coefficient increases which causes a higher electric current ahmad 2006 furthermore a low ph could cause a higher signal because more protons are available for reduction at the cathode we also expect an effect of the electric conductivity in the electrolyte since it facilitates the exchange of electrons in the liquid mixing conditions could also have an impact on the sensor signal because they influence the thickness of the diffusion layer helm et al 2010 furthermore the oxygen concentration could influence the amperometric measurement since oxygen has a high redox potential and is easily reduced with protons to water at the cathode air bubbles could also affect the measurement since they pose both electrochemical resistance and mass transfer barriers to the electrode reactions zhang and zeng 2012 the aeration rate in the nitrification reactor combines these effects the aim of this study was to evaluate whether an amperometric sensor allows a reliable in situ measurement of nitrite which could later be used for process control of urine nitrification for this purpose we determined the required upper limit of the working range of a nitrite sensor for urine nitrification furthermore we studied the robustness of the sensor signal against changes in the operational conditions such as temperature ph electric conductivity and aeration rate we also assessed the effects of typical wear and tear of the amperometric nitrite sensor i e we investigated the drift behaviour as well as fouling which is one important root cause of drift the overall hypothesis of our study was that an amperometric sensor is a robust and simple method to monitor nitrite concentrations during urine nitrification 2 materials and methods in the following chapters we describe the amperometric nitrite measurement principle and the experimental design we used to test its hardware implementation furthermore we explain how we assessed the necessary upper limit of the working range for urine nitrification and how the collected data were analysed finally we give an overview about the conducted experiments 2 1 amperometric nitrite measurement in our study of the amperometric sensor the nitrified urine was the electrolyte and nitrite the analyte we chose graphite for the working and counter electrode because it is rather cheap and has been applied in urine treatment before a potentiostat pgu 10v imp s ips elektroniklabor gmbh co kg germany and the software ecmwin v2 4 were used to hold the required potential between the reference and working electrode as well as to measure the occurring electric current in amperometric nitrite measurement the target reaction is the selective nitrite oxidation to nitrate that occurs at the anode which is the working electrode previous experiments in our lab showed that an anode potential of 1 20 v vs standard hydrogen electrode she is suitable for a selective nitrite oxidation at the anode fig 1 shows a scheme of the measurement setup we studied two variants of the amperometric nitrite sensor both of which were not equipped with a membrane or another diffusion barrier firstly a large sensor was tested which is a handmade prototype fig 2 a two graphite electrodes isostatically fine pressed graphite √∏ 7 mm r 8650 sgl carbon gmbh germany served as working and counter electrode a silver chloride reference electrode was used ag agcl e 0 21 v vs she in lab reference in 3 m kcl mettler toledo switzerland and was mounted into a luggin capillary filled with 3 m kcl solution the luggin capillary and the graphite electrodes were put into a rubber cone and inserted into a pvc pipe the electrodes were placed in a way that they did not protrude from the rubber cone and had a reactive surface of 38 mm2 each the potential between the reference and the working electrode was set to a value of e 0 99 v vs ag agcl2 which corresponds to 1 20 v vs she the second variant of the sensor was smaller and manufactured by ips elektroniklabor gmbh co kg germany fig 2b three graphite electrodes were used √∏ 3 mm r 8650 tvb gmbh germany two of them served as working and counter electrode respectively and the third electrode was the reference electrode experiments in our lab resulted in an approximate standard electrode potential of graphite as a reference electrode in nitrified urine of 0 31 v vs she the electrodes were sealed with a highly isolating material pure isolation st 33 copaltec gmbh germany within the housing √∏ 12 mm the electrodes did not protrude and had a reactive surface of 7 mm2 each the potential between the reference and the working electrode was set to a value of 0 89 v vs graphite which approximately corresponds to 1 20 v vs she 2 2 experimental setup we tested the amperometric nitrite sensor in a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr for urine nitrification at eawag in d√ºbendorf the liquid volume was between 120 l and 140 l and the reactor was operated with a two point control based on ph as was implemented by udert and w√§chter 2012 the average total ammonia concentration of the urine that was fed to the reactor was 2870 330 mgn l and the ph was 8 8 0 1 further details to the operation of the cstr can be found in fumasoli et al 2016 2 3 determination of the required upper limit of the working range in order to define the upper limit of the nitrite range to be covered by the sensor we determined the optimal nitrite concentration for urine nitrification according to anthonisen et al 1976 nob use no2 as substrate but are inhibited by hno2 as a consequence the optimal nitrite concentration for nob activity depends on the ph value the nob are exposed to based on the model of fumasoli 2016 and constants derived by reimann 2019 we derived an equation for nob activity equation 1 determined its maximum and solved it for the nitrite concentration no2 opt equation 2 we defined hno2 according to the acidic equilibrium in dependency of the nitrite activity ph and the dissociation constant for nitrite the ionic strength was estimated to be 0 16 mol l based on the concentration of the major inorganic ions by using this ionic strength and the davies approach stumm and morgan 1996 we calculated an average activity coefficient of 0 75 for single charged ions the detailed explanation of this assessment can

results of th√ºrlimann et al 2019 according to their study the course of the nitrite concentrations during nitrite degradation by nob shows an inflection point which corresponds to the value where the nob are most active at this point the kinetics of nob change from substrate inhibition to substrate limitation based on this approach we determined the optimal nitrite concentration at ph values between 5 9 and 6 1 details can be found in the supplementary material s1 1 2 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 signal processing the measurement frequency for both nitrite sensors was 1 hz the data were smoothened with the median of 30 s for all in situ experiments for the evaluation of the response time of the amperometric nitrite sensor see chapter 2 5 4 the sensor signal was not smoothened but was used in its raw form the sensor signal measured during the signal trend experiment see chapter 2 5 6 was smoothened with a 5 min moving median for the other ex situ experiments the median of 2 5 min was taken for each data point starting 30 s after the sensor was put into the stock solution in order to minimize initial response time effects 2 4 2 determining the calibration curve for each month we took all data points which lay between 0 mgn l and the upper limit of the working range and fitted a linear curve with a least squares fit the standard deviation of the method sxo was calculated according to iso 1990 the lower sxo the better the performance of the analytical method furthermore we calculated the coefficient of determination r2 which is a statistical measure of how well the model represents the real measurements fahrmeir et al 2016 an r2 of 1 means that the model perfectly fits the data points 2 4 3 model structure identification we used a polynomial regression model describing the sensor signal i e the current density as a function of the variables nitrite temperature and ph polynomial terms up to a power of 3 were tested leading to a total of 10 terms for the most complex model equation 3 in order to test which terms improve the model we created all possible combinations of these terms by setting some of the parameters to zero this resulted in 210 1024 different models which were compared according to their root mean square error rmse we compared the most complex function that includes all terms equation 3 to the linear model only including the nitrite concentration equation 4 in order to determine whether the inclusion of temperature and ph improved the estimation of the electric current in the supplementary material s1 2 the model

were measured with spectrophotometric cuvette tests lck 341 with a measurement range of 0 015 0 6 mgn l and lck 342 with a measurement range of 0 6 6 mgn l hach lange gmbh germany using a spectrophotometer from hach lange gmbh dr 2800 hach lange gmbh germany with these cuvette tests we typically achieve a measurement accuracy of 1 2 5 experiments 2 5 1 temperature and ph in order to test the sensor s dependency on temperature and ph 79 random samples from the urine nitrification reactor within the aimed nitrite range at temperatures between 22 5 and 26 5 c and at ph values between 6 0 and 7 1 were taken and compared with current density measurements with the large sensor supplementary material s1 3 the temperature variability resulted from the exhaust heat of a distiller that was placed in the room of the experimental setup and was not controlled in order to achieve different ph values the ph set point was adapted in the nitrification control 2 5 2 aeration another goal of this study was to assess which influence different aeration rates have on the amperometric nitrite measurement for this purpose we collected 58 random samples at aeration rates between 0 and 0 6 nm3 h with the large sensor from the urine nitrification reactor in order to receive different nitrite concentrations for every aeration rate the ph set point was increased or decreased during each test 2 5 3 electric conductivity we tested the influence of electric conductivity also we conducted an ex situ experiment with stock solutions at nitrite concentrations of 25 mgn l and 50 mgn l nano2 assay 99 merck kgaa darmstadt germany and at different levels of conductivity the electric conductivity was adjusted with sodium chloride assay 99 5 merck kgaa darmstadt germany to temperature corrected values of 10 20 30 40 and 50 ms cm we further produced stock solutions at 25 mgn l and 50 mgn l without adding sodium chloride which resulted in electric conductivities of 0 3 ms cm and 0 5 ms cm respectively 250 ml of each stock solution were mixed with a magnetic stirrer color squid white ika staufen germany at 400 rpm and the current density was measured with the small sensor the measurements were repeated 4 times 2 5 4 response time the assessment of the response time was executed according to iso 15839 iso 2003 in this initial experiment we considered the working range to be 0 to 24 mgn l therefore the response time assessed in this study is only valid for that range details to the procedure and calculations can be found in the supplementary material s1 4 2 5 5 typical wear and tear in order to evaluate whether the signals produced by the nitrite sensor exhibit drift and when so whether the root cause of drift includes fouling in addition to corrosion or disintegration of the sensor we conducted ex situ validation tests stock solutions of nitrite concentrations between 2 and 34 mgn l were prepared using nano2 assay 99 merck kgaa darmstadt germany and nanopure water no additional salt was added to these solutions 250 ml of the stock solutions were put into a glass beaker and continuously stirred with a magnetic stirrer at 400 rpm color squid white ika staufen germany the current density was measured for each concentration before and after cleaning the sensor and a linear curve of the current density in dependency of the nitrite concentration was fitted with a least squares fit first the ex situ validation of the sensor was executed weekly then every two weeks and the last measurement was executed after the sensor was in the nitrification reactor for 5 5 weeks the ex situ experiments were conducted with the large sensor the fouling effect on the small sensor was tested with nitrified urine in a similar ex situ experiment nitrified urine without detectable nitrite was collected and spiked with nan3 assay 99 merck schuchardt ohg hohenbrunn germany in order to stop biological activity six solutions were produced at nitrite concentrations of 0 10 20 30 40 and 50 mgn l nano2 assay 99 merck kgaa darmstadt germany 250 ml of the stock solutions were stirred with a magnetic stirrer at 400 rpm color squid white ika staufen germany the experiment was conducted after the sensor had been in the nitrification reactor for 10 days the current density in each of these solutions was measured before and after cleaning the sensor a linear curve of the current density as a function of the nitrite concentration was fitted with a least squares fit for the data before and after cleaning the sensor 2 5 6 ex situ versus in situ to determine whether the nitrite sensor can be calibrated ex situ we compared the calibration curves obtained from an ex situ experiment with the small sensor with synthetic nitrite solutions at 0 5 10 15 20 25 35 40 45 and 50 mgn l nano2 assay 99 merck kgaa darmstadt germany and an electric conductivity of 16 ms cm temperature corrected nacl assay 99 5 merck kgaa darmstadt germany and from the in situ measurements the in situ data were collected in november 2018 with the small sensor this experiment was not conducted with the large sensor furthermore the signal trend of a synthetic nitrite solution at a nitrite concentration of 25 mgn l nano2 assay 99 merck kgaa darmstadt germany and an electric conductivity of 16 ms cm nacl assay 99 5 merck kgaa darmstadt germany was observed with the small sensor over 400 min while it was stirred with a magnetic stirrer at 400 rpm color squid white ika staufen germany the ph and the dissolved oxygen concentration were measured and logged ph 340 and cond 340i wtw weilheim germany in order to be able to investigate the influence of these parameters 3 results 3 1 determination of the required upper limit of the working range our calculations resulted in optimal nitrite concentrations no2 opt of 12 30 mgn l at a ph between 6 0 and 6 8 fig 3 these values are based on equation 2 using an average ionic strength of 0 16 mol l and an average activity coefficient for single charged ions of 0 75 according to th√ºrlimann et al 2019 the inflection point in the downward trend of the nitrite concentration corresponds to the point of maximal nob activity using the data of th√ºrlimann et al 2019 we estimated that this inflection point occurs at 12 mgn l at a ph between 5 9 and 6 1 which confirms the theoretical calculations shown in fig 3 to ensure maximum nob performance and prevent inhibition by nitrite the urine nitrification reactor should be operated close to no2 opt according to iso 8466 1 iso 1990 the most frequently expected concentration should lie in the centre of the working range of an analytical method since we expect the optimal nitrite concentration to be in a range of 12 30 mgn l the upper limit of the working range should be between 24 and 60 mgn l our subjective yet informed decision is that the sensor should be able to reliably measure concentrations up to 50 mgn l 3 2 data calibration the linear calibration curves of all months resulted in a standard deviation of the method sxo of 4 mgn l or less table 1 the measurements from july 2018 resulted in a particularly low standard deviation because the four samples from that month were collected during one day only so that environmental conditions or sensor properties were very similar for all four measurements the coefficients of determination r2 show that overall quadratic curves did not result in substantially better fits than linear curves more details to the calibration curves can be found in the supplementary material s2 1 as an example for a data fit fig 4 shows the measurements with the large sensor in april 2018 and with the small sensor in october 2018 with a linear fit and the 95 confidence interval it can be seen that the offsets of the functions are close to 0 a m2 and the 95 confidence interval covers 0 a m2 since all fits showed similar small offsets and linear behaviour we assume that a linear curve through the origin is suitable for calibration as a consequence for practical applications a one point calibration of the sensitivity only might be sufficient however in our investigations we determined both the offset and sensitivity to obtain maximum accuracy the spread of the nitrite concentration residuals generally increased with increasing nitrite concentrations fig 5 however the relative prediction residuals that is the residuals after division by the nitrite concentration fig 6 and fig 7 were nearly constant above a nitrite concentration of 5 mgn l 90 of the data above 5 mgn l have a maximum relative deviation of 20 and 21 for the large and the small sensor respectively this means that the standard deviation of the measurement error is close to proportional to the measured value in this range below 5 mgn l the relative deviation increases substantially with decreasing nitrite concentration therefore we conclude that measurements below 5 mgn l have large errors and that the sample for the one point calibration should be at a nitrite concentration higher than 5 mgn l we suggest to choose a point close to the centre of the working range since this is the concentration we expect most frequently i e around 25 mgn l see chapter 3 1 3 3 factors influencing the raw sensor signal 3 3 1 temperature and ph the results obtained in april to may 2018 with the large sensor are discussed first experiments with the small sensor confirmed the signal s dependencies on the nitrite concentration temperature and ph the data obtained with the large sensor are shown here while the data obtained with the small sensor are shown in the supplementary material s2 2 the polynomial regression showed that the current density can be described well when neglecting ph and temperature the linear model model b equation 4 current density as a function of an offset and no2 fig 8 a resulted in an rmse of 1 0 a m2 model a which best describes the data equation 3 current density as a function of an offset no2 no2 2 no2 3 t t2 t3 ph ph2 and ph3 resulted in an rmse of 0 7 a m2 including temperature and ph increases the complexity of the model yet does not offer a considerably lower rmse than the linear model furthermore when compared visually fig 8b it is apparent that the residuals of model a and model b lie in the same range therefore we conclude that the influence of temperature and ph on the current density signal was negligible in our experiments the standard deviation of the method sxo of model b was 3 3 mgn l 3 3 2 aeration the assessment in june 2018 showed that the aeration rate does not influence the signal of the large sensor except at an aeration rate close to 0 nm3 h fig 9 when aeration was between 0 and 0 05 nm3 h 3 a lower signal was measured which we assume to be caused by diffusion limitation i e a limitation of the transport of nitrite to the electrode due to poor mixing conditions we merged the data from all assessed aeration rates omitting the data at an aeration rate of approximately 0 nm3 h we fitted a linear curve to the current density in dependency of the nitrite concentration with a least squares fit this resulted in a standard deviation of the method sxo of 3 3 mgn l we conclude that the aeration rate does not influence the signal as long as the aeration rate in the reactor is 0 2 nm3 h or more in the experiments with the small sensor we also did not find any influence of aeration on the measurement signal when aeration was 0 2 nm3 h or higher the results can be found in the supplementary material s2 3 3 3 3 electric conductivity the assessment of the influence of electric conductivity showed that a difference in electric conductivity does not affect the sensor signal at 10 ms cm or more fig 10 however as expected at low electric conductivities of 0 3 ms cm and 0 5 ms cm for 25 mgn l and 50 mgn l respectively we measured a lower current density if the liquid to be measured is not conductive an electrochemical measurement is not possible 3 4 response time the assessment of the response time resulted in a rise time of 1 4 0 8 s and a fall time below 5 2 1 3 s these results were obtained with synthetic nitrite solutions and response times in nitrified urine might be slightly different nevertheless the experiment indicates that the sensor reacts within a few seconds to changes in the nitrite concentration 3 5 typical wear and tear 3 5 1 drift in fig 11 one can view the calibration results obtained in the ex situ experiments with the large sensor for a period of 4 months the slopes of the fitted linear curves were 0 087 8 a m2 mgn l and the offsets were in a range of 0 08 to 0 10 a m2 with only one exception on may 22 2018 thus suggesting a lack of drift for the offset as well as the sensitivity the in situ measurements fig 12 a and b also showed a rather stable offset close to 0 a m2 large sensor 0 20 1 22 a m2 small sensor 0 00 0 29 a m2 while the sensitivity of the calibration curve changed over time large sensor 0 349 18 a m2 mgn l small sensor 0 118 61 a m2 mgn l the sensitivity of the small sensor showed a stronger drift than the one of the large sensor which might have two causes first the smaller reaction surface makes the sensor more susceptible to fouling or changes in the environmental conditions second the reference electrode in the small sensor was graphite while the large sensor had a conventional silver chloride reference the graphite reference electrode might have been more prone to aging effects 3 5 2 fouling control measurements did not show any significant fouling effects on the large sensor during its operation in the nitrification reactor even after 5 5 weeks operation in the reactor the ex situ calibration curves determined in synthetic nitrite solutions show very similar slopes before and after cleaning supplementary material s2 4 in contrast the ex situ experiment with the small sensor which was executed with nitrified urine showed a stronger effect of fouling supplementary material s2 4 the offsets lie close together while the sensitivity of the calibration curve is different before and after cleaning the sensor as expected the signal is higher after cleaning since there is no biofilm that either consumes the nitrite before it is measured or limits nitrite diffusion the different outcome of these experiments might be due to differences in the sensor construction however we assume that the different results were caused by the medium composition which varies in factors such as particles background matrix electric conductivity or density 3 6 ex situ versus in situ we found that the amperometric nitrite sensor should be calibrated in situ rather than ex situ the small sensor measured a higher current density ex situ synthetic nitrite solution with an electric conductivity of 16 ms cm than in situ for both calibration curves the offsets were close to 0 a m2 while the slopes were different fig 13 a the experiment was not conducted with the large sensor another experiment showed that the sensor measured the current density of the synthetic nitrite solution with a downward drift over the measurement time of 400 min while the ph and the dissolved oxygen concentration stayed nearly stable fig 13b this suggests that it takes at least 400 min to form an equilibrium between reaction kinetics diffusion and electric field this supports our recommendation to calibrate the sensor in situ 4 discussion 4 1 influence of environmental conditions we found that the effects of temperature ph aeration electric conductivity and dissolved oxygen concentration on the amperometric nitrite sensor are negligible in the assessed range of temperature and ph 22 5 26 5 c and 6 0 7 1 respectively no significant influence was detected furthermore we did not find any dependency on the aeration rate as long as the urine nitrification reactor was aerated neither did a variation in electric conductivity cause any change in the sensor signal at 10 ms cm or more the amperometric nitrite sensor is well suited for urine nitrification since ph temperature and the electric conductivity are usually in ranges for which we did not find any significant influence 4 2 drift while there was no noticeable drift in the ex situ experiments we observed that the amperometric nitrite sensor has a drift in situ i e the sensitivity varies while the offset stays rather stable around 0 a m2 further research is necessary in order to find out whether the sensitivity decreases steadily or whether a seasonal variability can be observed nevertheless we propose that the drift can be compensated for by regular calibration for which a one point calibration may be sufficient we suggest monthly in situ calibration of the amperometric nitrite sensor another option is to quantify and include the drift in process control th√ºrlimann et al 2019 showed that a nitrite sensor prone to offset drift can be used for stabilizing control in urine nitrification by applying qualitative trend analysis note that the amperometric measurement exhibits drift of the sensitivity which one may not be able to account for with qualitative trend analysis 4 3 accuracy of the amperometric nitrite sensor the calibration curves of the in situ experiments for each month resulted in a coefficient of variation of the method vxo that is the standard deviation of the method sxo divided by the mean concentration of 17 or less for the nitrite concentration range of 0 50 mgn l in comparison according to hach lange gmbh spectrophotometric cuvette tests have a vxo of 3 for the range of 0 6 6 0 mgn l lck 342 hach lange gmbh germany and for the range of 0 015 0 6 mgn l lsk 341 hach lange gmbh germany as expected the amperometric nitrite sensor signal is not as accurate as lab based measurements however the sensor is especially valuable as an automated on line measurement 4 4 strengths and weaknesses of sensors for nitrite measurement to our knowledge there exist three measurement principles that have been tested for on line nitrite measurement in wastewater two of these are available commercially in the form of nitrite analyzers colorimetric measurement principle and spectrophotometric sensors light absorbance measurement principle a third principle amperometric measurement is tested for the first time in this work analyzers have the particular advantage of providing measurements that can be unbiased precise and drift free one disadvantage is that this measurement is produced ex situ with a measurement cycle that lasts 10 20 min thus leading to delay that may be significant for process control purposes this also means the measurement frequency is fairly low even more important is that significant maintenance efforts are required for this type of equipment this includes upkeep of the sample preparation system e g filter replacement and ensuring that reagents are both fresh and available in sufficient amounts in contrast spectrophotometric instruments can be used in situ do not require sample preparation and can be equipped with self cleaning devices such as pressured air nozzles brushes or wipers this reduces the cost of maintenance while not eliminating it entirely a key advantage of spectrophotometric measurements is that they are sensitive to many compounds this however induces a lack of specificity which is accounted for by specialized knowledge such as the execution of calibration experiments and software tools for information extraction ma≈°iƒá et al 2015 th√ºrlimann et al 2019 the proposed nitrite sensor combines advantages from both analyzers and spectrophotometric measurements it is simultaneously sensitive and specific to nitrite and is expected to require limited maintenance efforts only in addition it can be produced from cheap materials the amperometric nitrite measurement is not yet a mature technology and therefore further testing including sensor and model validation is necessary the observed drift of the sensor s specificity in in situ deployment is the only known detractor at this moment which needs to be quantified and addressed in future research 4 5 application we found that 90 of the data above 5 mgn l have a maximum relative deviation of 20 and 21 for the large and the small sensor respectively the treatment of municipal wastewater requires a precise nitrite control at low concentrations otherwise we risk nitrous oxide production wunderlin et al 2012 as well as exceedance of the effluent discharge limit of 0 3 mgn l for the nitrite concentration gujer 2006 since the relative prediction residuals increase strongly below 5 mgn l see section 3 2 we do not recommend the sensors in the current configuration for nitrite measurement in municipal wastewater treatment where nitrite concentrations below 5 mgn l can already be critical contrary in urine nitrification higher nitrite concentrations are tolerated our calculations suggest that nitrite concentrations of e g 12 mgn l at a ph of 6 0 or 30 mgn l at a ph of 6 8 must not be exceeded in order to prevent nitrite accumulation based on our experience with the sensor we assume that with the amperometric nitrite sensor high nitrite concentrations can be avoided without difficulty therefore we conclude that the sensor is a promising tool for process control of urine nitrification 5 conclusions with standard deviations below 4 mgn l and a minimum linear nitrite range of 0 50 mgn l the amperometric nitrite sensor covers the critical range of nitrite accumulation and is well suited for on line nitrite monitoring and process control in urine nitrification we expect that the current amperometric sensor is also well suitable for controlling nitrification of other high strength nitrogen solutions such as digester supernatant however an increase of the sensitivity is necessary for nitrite control in the mainstream of municipal wastewater treatment drift corrections are necessary but monthly intervals for calibration are sufficient we propose that a one point calibration of the sensitivity is suitable the sensors must be calibrated in situ in urine nitrification the increased nitrite concentrations required for the one point calibration can be triggered by short increases of the inflow declaration of competing interest the authors

19977,sensing nitrite in situ in wastewater treatment processes could greatly simplify process control especially during treatment of high strength nitrogen wastewaters such as digester supernatant or as in our case urine the two technologies available today i e an on line nitrite analyzer and a spectrophotometric sensor have strong limitations such as sample preparation cost of ownership and strong interferences a promising alternative is the amperometric measurement of nitrite which we assessed in this study we investigated the sensor in a urine nitrification reactor and in ex situ experiments based on theoretical calculations as well as a practical approach we determined that the critical nitrite concentrations for nitrite oxidizing bacteria lie between 12 and 30 mgn l at ph 6 to 6 8 consequently we decided that the sensor should be able to reliably measure concentrations up to 50 mgn l which is about double the value of the critical nitrite concentration we found that the influences of various ambient conditions such as temperature ph electric conductivity and aeration rate in the ranges expected in urine nitrification systems are negligible for low nitrite concentrations as expected in municipal wastewater treatment the tested amperometric nitrite sensor was not sufficiently sensitive nevertheless the sensor delivered reliable measurements for nitrite concentrations of 5 50 mgn l or higher this means that the amperometric nitrite sensor allows detection of critical nitrite concentrations without difficulty in high strength nitrogen conversion processes such as the nitrification of human urine graphical abstract image 1 keywords continuous measurement in situ measurement electrochemical measurement amperometric sensor critical nitrite concentration nitrite measurement 1 introduction in many wastewater treatment processes maintaining low nitrite concentrations is crucial for several reasons first the effluent discharge limit for the nitrite concentration must be met in switzerland it lies at 0 3 mgn l gujer 2006 due to its toxicity for fish kroupova et al 2005 second high nitrite concentrations must be avoided in order to prevent the formation of harmful gases such as nitric oxide and nitrous oxide during nitrification and denitrification schreiber et al 2012 third nitrite is an intermediate product in nitrification and exists in equilibrium with its protonated form free nitrous acid hno2 which can inhibit bacteria in wastewater treatment zhou et al 2011 in many processes such as conventional nitrification for example nitrification of urine for fertilizer recovery such inhibition should be avoided indeed once nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob are inhibited by nitrite the compound accumulates faster and nob are inhibited even more strongly which can be detrimental for processes relying on complete nitrification of ammonia over nitrite to nitrate udert and w√§chter 2012 in a number of specialized processes such as sharon anammox volcke et al 2006 daemon wett et al 2007 and oland kuai and verstraete 1998 it is paramount that nob growth is limited the presence of nitrite can cause such growth in turn leading to reduced energy and electron donor efficiency of these processes thus nitrite is a key variable for optimal operation of many nitrifying processes regardless of the desirability of nob activity an on line nitrite measurement would be an ideal tool to detect detrimental nitrite concentration levels and to prompt timely for corrective actions to our knowledge two principles are available today to measure nitrite on line in wastewater treatment one is based on a colorimetric measurement i e on line nitrite analyzers e g nitrite analyzer liquiline system ca80no endress hauser reinach switzerland sa9101 skalar analytical b v breda netherlands this technique shows no significant drift and has a high sensitivity and specificity however the cost of ownership ellram 1995 of an on line analyzer is typically high due to high hardware costs and intensive maintenance requirements ma≈°iƒá et al 2015 rieger et al 2008 furthermore it is an ex situ measurement and needs sampling preparation rieger et al 2004 the complexity and costs for such automated sampling preparation can be an issue especially for small treatment plants another continuous nitrite measurement is based on the light absorbance measurement principle th√ºrlimann et al 2017 this is a spectrophotometric measurement i e through measurement of light absorbance at multiple wavelengths and makes use of the fact that many chemical compounds including nitrite absorb light differently at different wavelengths robust devices built around this principle are available commercially importantly these measurements can be obtained in situ and do not require sensitive sample preparation steps drolc and vrtov≈°ek 2010 this type of sensors is sensitive to a variety of inorganic and organic compounds so that one can use a single device to measure multiple variables at once unfortunately this also means that the absorbance measurements lack specificity this in turn challenges accurate calibration and induces signal drift when the mixture of non target components that absorb light e g organic matter or solids deviates from the mixtures observed during sensor calibration such a phenomenon is often described as a change of the background spectrum th√ºrlimann et al 2019 while sensor drift can be compensated by fault tolerant control schemes deshpande et al 2009 th√ºrlimann et al 2019 it is generally considered desirable to avoid sensor drift entirely the amperometric nitrite measurement which we assessed in this study is a promising alternative that may lead to the construction of a drift free on line nitrite sensor with this method nitrite concentrations in aqueous solutions are measured electrochemically the sensor consists of three electrodes a reference electrode a working electrode in our case the anode and a counter electrode in our case the cathode fig 1 helm et al 2010 the operation mode is potentiostatic which means that a constant potential is applied between the reference and the working electrode when a chemical substance reacts at the working electrode e g nitrite is oxidized at the anode electrons are transferred between the substance and the working electrode when at the same time a chemical substance reacts at the counter electrode e g protons are reduced to hydrogen at the cathode an electric current is generated between the working and counter electrode hamann and vielstich 2005 this current can be set in correlation to the concentration of the analyte i e the substance which reacts at the working electrode in contrast to the potentiometric measuring principle which is based on a passive registration of the potential difference between two electrodes schwedt et al 2016 and is applied in ion selective electrode ise sensors for ammonium or nitrate amperometric measurement is based on actively controlling the potential at the working electrode and measuring the resulting electric current the amperometric measuring principle has been studied and commercialized and normally requires a membrane or some other diffusion barrier helm et al 2010 in order to achieve selectivity amperometric sensors are available e g for dissolved oxygen clark electrode hamann and vielstich 2005 ozone e g 9185 sc ozone amperometric analyzer hach lange gmbh rheineck switzerland helm et al 2010 and free chlorine e g analog free chlorine sensor ccs51 endress hauser reinach switzerland according to the review of helm et al 2010 temperature influences amperometric measurements since it affects the rate of diffusion with temperature the width of the diffusion layer decreases and the diffusion coefficient increases which causes a higher electric current ahmad 2006 furthermore a low ph could cause a higher signal because more protons are available for reduction at the cathode we also expect an effect of the electric conductivity in the electrolyte since it facilitates the exchange of electrons in the liquid mixing conditions could also have an impact on the sensor signal because they influence the thickness of the diffusion layer helm et al 2010 furthermore the oxygen concentration could influence the amperometric measurement since oxygen has a high redox potential and is easily reduced with protons to water at the cathode air bubbles could also affect the measurement since they pose both electrochemical resistance and mass transfer barriers to the electrode reactions zhang and zeng 2012 the aeration rate in the nitrification reactor combines these effects the aim of this study was to evaluate whether an amperometric sensor allows a reliable in situ measurement of nitrite which could later be used for process control of urine nitrification for this purpose we determined the required upper limit of the working range of a nitrite sensor for urine nitrification furthermore we studied the robustness of the sensor signal against changes in the operational conditions such as temperature ph electric conductivity and aeration rate we also assessed the effects of typical wear and tear of the amperometric nitrite sensor i e we investigated the drift behaviour as well as fouling which is one important root cause of drift the overall hypothesis of our study was that an amperometric sensor is a robust and simple method to monitor nitrite concentrations during urine nitrification 2 materials and methods in the following chapters we describe the amperometric nitrite measurement principle and the experimental design we used to test its hardware implementation furthermore we explain how we assessed the necessary upper limit of the working range for urine nitrification and how the collected data were analysed finally we give an overview about the conducted experiments 2 1 amperometric nitrite measurement in our study of the amperometric sensor the nitrified urine was the electrolyte and nitrite the analyte we chose graphite for the working and counter electrode because it is rather cheap and has been applied in urine treatment before a potentiostat pgu 10v imp s ips elektroniklabor gmbh co kg germany and the software ecmwin v2 4 were used to hold the required potential between the reference and working electrode as well as to measure the occurring electric current in amperometric nitrite measurement the target reaction is the selective nitrite oxidation to nitrate that occurs at the anode which is the working electrode previous experiments in our lab showed that an anode potential of 1 20 v vs standard hydrogen electrode she is suitable for a selective nitrite oxidation at the anode fig 1 shows a scheme of the measurement setup we studied two variants of the amperometric nitrite sensor both of which were not equipped with a membrane or another diffusion barrier firstly a large sensor was tested which is a handmade prototype fig 2 a two graphite electrodes isostatically fine pressed graphite √∏ 7 mm r 8650 sgl carbon gmbh germany served as working and counter electrode a silver chloride reference electrode was used ag agcl e 0 21 v vs she in lab reference in 3 m kcl mettler toledo switzerland and was mounted into a luggin capillary filled with 3 m kcl solution the luggin capillary and the graphite electrodes were put into a rubber cone and inserted into a pvc pipe the electrodes were placed in a way that they did not protrude from the rubber cone and had a reactive surface of 38 mm2 each the potential between the reference and the working electrode was set to a value of e 0 99 v vs ag agcl2 which corresponds to 1 20 v vs she the second variant of the sensor was smaller and manufactured by ips elektroniklabor gmbh co kg germany fig 2b three graphite electrodes were used √∏ 3 mm r 8650 tvb gmbh germany two of them served as working and counter electrode respectively and the third electrode was the reference electrode experiments in our lab resulted in an approximate standard electrode potential of graphite as a reference electrode in nitrified urine of 0 31 v vs she the electrodes were sealed with a highly isolating material pure isolation st 33 copaltec gmbh germany within the housing √∏ 12 mm the electrodes did not protrude and had a reactive surface of 7 mm2 each the potential between the reference and the working electrode was set to a value of 0 89 v vs graphite which approximately corresponds to 1 20 v vs she 2 2 experimental setup we tested the amperometric nitrite sensor in a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr for urine nitrification at eawag in d√ºbendorf the liquid volume was between 120 l and 140 l and the reactor was operated with a two point control based on ph as was implemented by udert and w√§chter 2012 the average total ammonia concentration of the urine that was fed to the reactor was 2870 330 mgn l and the ph was 8 8 0 1 further details to the operation of the cstr can be found in fumasoli et al 2016 2 3 determination of the required upper limit of the working range in order to define the upper limit of the nitrite range to be covered by the sensor we determined the optimal nitrite concentration for urine nitrification according to anthonisen et al 1976 nob use no2 as substrate but are inhibited by hno2 as a consequence the optimal nitrite concentration for nob activity depends on the ph value the nob are exposed to based on the model of fumasoli 2016 and constants derived by reimann 2019 we derived an equation for nob activity equation 1 determined its maximum and solved it for the nitrite concentration no2 opt equation 2 we defined hno2 according to the acidic equilibrium in dependency of the nitrite activity ph and the dissociation constant for nitrite the ionic strength was estimated to be 0 16 mol l based on the concentration of the major inorganic ions by using this ionic strength and the davies approach stumm and morgan 1996 we calculated an average activity coefficient of 0 75 for single charged ions the detailed explanation of this assessment can

results of th√ºrlimann et al 2019 according to their study the course of the nitrite concentrations during nitrite degradation by nob shows an inflection point which corresponds to the value where the nob are most active at this point the kinetics of nob change from substrate inhibition to substrate limitation based on this approach we determined the optimal nitrite concentration at ph values between 5 9 and 6 1 details can be found in the supplementary material s1 1 2 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 signal processing the measurement frequency for both nitrite sensors was 1 hz the data were smoothened with the median of 30 s for all in situ experiments for the evaluation of the response time of the amperometric nitrite sensor see chapter 2 5 4 the sensor signal was not smoothened but was used in its raw form the sensor signal measured during the signal trend experiment see chapter 2 5 6 was smoothened with a 5 min moving median for the other ex situ experiments the median of 2 5 min was taken for each data point starting 30 s after the sensor was put into the stock solution in order to minimize initial response time effects 2 4 2 determining the calibration curve for each month we took all data points which lay between 0 mgn l and the upper limit of the working range and fitted a linear curve with a least squares fit the standard deviation of the method sxo was calculated according to iso 1990 the lower sxo the better the performance of the analytical method furthermore we calculated the coefficient of determination r2 which is a statistical measure of how well the model represents the real measurements fahrmeir et al 2016 an r2 of 1 means that the model perfectly fits the data points 2 4 3 model structure identification we used a polynomial regression model describing the sensor signal i e the current density as a function of the variables nitrite temperature and ph polynomial terms up to a power of 3 were tested leading to a total of 10 terms for the most complex model equation 3 in order to test which terms improve the model we created all possible combinations of these terms by setting some of the parameters to zero this resulted in 210 1024 different models which were compared according to their root mean square error rmse we compared the most complex function that includes all terms equation 3 to the linear model only including the nitrite concentration equation 4 in order to determine whether the inclusion of temperature and ph improved the estimation of the electric current in the supplementary material s1 2 the model

were measured with spectrophotometric cuvette tests lck 341 with a measurement range of 0 015 0 6 mgn l and lck 342 with a measurement range of 0 6 6 mgn l hach lange gmbh germany using a spectrophotometer from hach lange gmbh dr 2800 hach lange gmbh germany with these cuvette tests we typically achieve a measurement accuracy of 1 2 5 experiments 2 5 1 temperature and ph in order to test the sensor s dependency on temperature and ph 79 random samples from the urine nitrification reactor within the aimed nitrite range at temperatures between 22 5 and 26 5 c and at ph values between 6 0 and 7 1 were taken and compared with current density measurements with the large sensor supplementary material s1 3 the temperature variability resulted from the exhaust heat of a distiller that was placed in the room of the experimental setup and was not controlled in order to achieve different ph values the ph set point was adapted in the nitrification control 2 5 2 aeration another goal of this study was to assess which influence different aeration rates have on the amperometric nitrite measurement for this purpose we collected 58 random samples at aeration rates between 0 and 0 6 nm3 h with the large sensor from the urine nitrification reactor in order to receive different nitrite concentrations for every aeration rate the ph set point was increased or decreased during each test 2 5 3 electric conductivity we tested the influence of electric conductivity also we conducted an ex situ experiment with stock solutions at nitrite concentrations of 25 mgn l and 50 mgn l nano2 assay 99 merck kgaa darmstadt germany and at different levels of conductivity the electric conductivity was adjusted with sodium chloride assay 99 5 merck kgaa darmstadt germany to temperature corrected values of 10 20 30 40 and 50 ms cm we further produced stock solutions at 25 mgn l and 50 mgn l without adding sodium chloride which resulted in electric conductivities of 0 3 ms cm and 0 5 ms cm respectively 250 ml of each stock solution were mixed with a magnetic stirrer color squid white ika staufen germany at 400 rpm and the current density was measured with the small sensor the measurements were repeated 4 times 2 5 4 response time the assessment of the response time was executed according to iso 15839 iso 2003 in this initial experiment we considered the working range to be 0 to 24 mgn l therefore the response time assessed in this study is only valid for that range details to the procedure and calculations can be found in the supplementary material s1 4 2 5 5 typical wear and tear in order to evaluate whether the signals produced by the nitrite sensor exhibit drift and when so whether the root cause of drift includes fouling in addition to corrosion or disintegration of the sensor we conducted ex situ validation tests stock solutions of nitrite concentrations between 2 and 34 mgn l were prepared using nano2 assay 99 merck kgaa darmstadt germany and nanopure water no additional salt was added to these solutions 250 ml of the stock solutions were put into a glass beaker and continuously stirred with a magnetic stirrer at 400 rpm color squid white ika staufen germany the current density was measured for each concentration before and after cleaning the sensor and a linear curve of the current density in dependency of the nitrite concentration was fitted with a least squares fit first the ex situ validation of the sensor was executed weekly then every two weeks and the last measurement was executed after the sensor was in the nitrification reactor for 5 5 weeks the ex situ experiments were conducted with the large sensor the fouling effect on the small sensor was tested with nitrified urine in a similar ex situ experiment nitrified urine without detectable nitrite was collected and spiked with nan3 assay 99 merck schuchardt ohg hohenbrunn germany in order to stop biological activity six solutions were produced at nitrite concentrations of 0 10 20 30 40 and 50 mgn l nano2 assay 99 merck kgaa darmstadt germany 250 ml of the stock solutions were stirred with a magnetic stirrer at 400 rpm color squid white ika staufen germany the experiment was conducted after the sensor had been in the nitrification reactor for 10 days the current density in each of these solutions was measured before and after cleaning the sensor a linear curve of the current density as a function of the nitrite concentration was fitted with a least squares fit for the data before and after cleaning the sensor 2 5 6 ex situ versus in situ to determine whether the nitrite sensor can be calibrated ex situ we compared the calibration curves obtained from an ex situ experiment with the small sensor with synthetic nitrite solutions at 0 5 10 15 20 25 35 40 45 and 50 mgn l nano2 assay 99 merck kgaa darmstadt germany and an electric conductivity of 16 ms cm temperature corrected nacl assay 99 5 merck kgaa darmstadt germany and from the in situ measurements the in situ data were collected in november 2018 with the small sensor this experiment was not conducted with the large sensor furthermore the signal trend of a synthetic nitrite solution at a nitrite concentration of 25 mgn l nano2 assay 99 merck kgaa darmstadt germany and an electric conductivity of 16 ms cm nacl assay 99 5 merck kgaa darmstadt germany was observed with the small sensor over 400 min while it was stirred with a magnetic stirrer at 400 rpm color squid white ika staufen germany the ph and the dissolved oxygen concentration were measured and logged ph 340 and cond 340i wtw weilheim germany in order to be able to investigate the influence of these parameters 3 results 3 1 determination of the required upper limit of the working range our calculations resulted in optimal nitrite concentrations no2 opt of 12 30 mgn l at a ph between 6 0 and 6 8 fig 3 these values are based on equation 2 using an average ionic strength of 0 16 mol l and an average activity coefficient for single charged ions of 0 75 according to th√ºrlimann et al 2019 the inflection point in the downward trend of the nitrite concentration corresponds to the point of maximal nob activity using the data of th√ºrlimann et al 2019 we estimated that this inflection point occurs at 12 mgn l at a ph between 5 9 and 6 1 which confirms the theoretical calculations shown in fig 3 to ensure maximum nob performance and prevent inhibition by nitrite the urine nitrification reactor should be operated close to no2 opt according to iso 8466 1 iso 1990 the most frequently expected concentration should lie in the centre of the working range of an analytical method since we expect the optimal nitrite concentration to be in a range of 12 30 mgn l the upper limit of the working range should be between 24 and 60 mgn l our subjective yet informed decision is that the sensor should be able to reliably measure concentrations up to 50 mgn l 3 2 data calibration the linear calibration curves of all months resulted in a standard deviation of the method sxo of 4 mgn l or less table 1 the measurements from july 2018 resulted in a particularly low standard deviation because the four samples from that month were collected during one day only so that environmental conditions or sensor properties were very similar for all four measurements the coefficients of determination r2 show that overall quadratic curves did not result in substantially better fits than linear curves more details to the calibration curves can be found in the supplementary material s2 1 as an example for a data fit fig 4 shows the measurements with the large sensor in april 2018 and with the small sensor in october 2018 with a linear fit and the 95 confidence interval it can be seen that the offsets of the functions are close to 0 a m2 and the 95 confidence interval covers 0 a m2 since all fits showed similar small offsets and linear behaviour we assume that a linear curve through the origin is suitable for calibration as a consequence for practical applications a one point calibration of the sensitivity only might be sufficient however in our investigations we determined both the offset and sensitivity to obtain maximum accuracy the spread of the nitrite concentration residuals generally increased with increasing nitrite concentrations fig 5 however the relative prediction residuals that is the residuals after division by the nitrite concentration fig 6 and fig 7 were nearly constant above a nitrite concentration of 5 mgn l 90 of the data above 5 mgn l have a maximum relative deviation of 20 and 21 for the large and the small sensor respectively this means that the standard deviation of the measurement error is close to proportional to the measured value in this range below 5 mgn l the relative deviation increases substantially with decreasing nitrite concentration therefore we conclude that measurements below 5 mgn l have large errors and that the sample for the one point calibration should be at a nitrite concentration higher than 5 mgn l we suggest to choose a point close to the centre of the working range since this is the concentration we expect most frequently i e around 25 mgn l see chapter 3 1 3 3 factors influencing the raw sensor signal 3 3 1 temperature and ph the results obtained in april to may 2018 with the large sensor are discussed first experiments with the small sensor confirmed the signal s dependencies on the nitrite concentration temperature and ph the data obtained with the large sensor are shown here while the data obtained with the small sensor are shown in the supplementary material s2 2 the polynomial regression showed that the current density can be described well when neglecting ph and temperature the linear model model b equation 4 current density as a function of an offset and no2 fig 8 a resulted in an rmse of 1 0 a m2 model a which best describes the data equation 3 current density as a function of an offset no2 no2 2 no2 3 t t2 t3 ph ph2 and ph3 resulted in an rmse of 0 7 a m2 including temperature and ph increases the complexity of the model yet does not offer a considerably lower rmse than the linear model furthermore when compared visually fig 8b it is apparent that the residuals of model a and model b lie in the same range therefore we conclude that the influence of temperature and ph on the current density signal was negligible in our experiments the standard deviation of the method sxo of model b was 3 3 mgn l 3 3 2 aeration the assessment in june 2018 showed that the aeration rate does not influence the signal of the large sensor except at an aeration rate close to 0 nm3 h fig 9 when aeration was between 0 and 0 05 nm3 h 3 a lower signal was measured which we assume to be caused by diffusion limitation i e a limitation of the transport of nitrite to the electrode due to poor mixing conditions we merged the data from all assessed aeration rates omitting the data at an aeration rate of approximately 0 nm3 h we fitted a linear curve to the current density in dependency of the nitrite concentration with a least squares fit this resulted in a standard deviation of the method sxo of 3 3 mgn l we conclude that the aeration rate does not influence the signal as long as the aeration rate in the reactor is 0 2 nm3 h or more in the experiments with the small sensor we also did not find any influence of aeration on the measurement signal when aeration was 0 2 nm3 h or higher the results can be found in the supplementary material s2 3 3 3 3 electric conductivity the assessment of the influence of electric conductivity showed that a difference in electric conductivity does not affect the sensor signal at 10 ms cm or more fig 10 however as expected at low electric conductivities of 0 3 ms cm and 0 5 ms cm for 25 mgn l and 50 mgn l respectively we measured a lower current density if the liquid to be measured is not conductive an electrochemical measurement is not possible 3 4 response time the assessment of the response time resulted in a rise time of 1 4 0 8 s and a fall time below 5 2 1 3 s these results were obtained with synthetic nitrite solutions and response times in nitrified urine might be slightly different nevertheless the experiment indicates that the sensor reacts within a few seconds to changes in the nitrite concentration 3 5 typical wear and tear 3 5 1 drift in fig 11 one can view the calibration results obtained in the ex situ experiments with the large sensor for a period of 4 months the slopes of the fitted linear curves were 0 087 8 a m2 mgn l and the offsets were in a range of 0 08 to 0 10 a m2 with only one exception on may 22 2018 thus suggesting a lack of drift for the offset as well as the sensitivity the in situ measurements fig 12 a and b also showed a rather stable offset close to 0 a m2 large sensor 0 20 1 22 a m2 small sensor 0 00 0 29 a m2 while the sensitivity of the calibration curve changed over time large sensor 0 349 18 a m2 mgn l small sensor 0 118 61 a m2 mgn l the sensitivity of the small sensor showed a stronger drift than the one of the large sensor which might have two causes first the smaller reaction surface makes the sensor more susceptible to fouling or changes in the environmental conditions second the reference electrode in the small sensor was graphite while the large sensor had a conventional silver chloride reference the graphite reference electrode might have been more prone to aging effects 3 5 2 fouling control measurements did not show any significant fouling effects on the large sensor during its operation in the nitrification reactor even after 5 5 weeks operation in the reactor the ex situ calibration curves determined in synthetic nitrite solutions show very similar slopes before and after cleaning supplementary material s2 4 in contrast the ex situ experiment with the small sensor which was executed with nitrified urine showed a stronger effect of fouling supplementary material s2 4 the offsets lie close together while the sensitivity of the calibration curve is different before and after cleaning the sensor as expected the signal is higher after cleaning since there is no biofilm that either consumes the nitrite before it is measured or limits nitrite diffusion the different outcome of these experiments might be due to differences in the sensor construction however we assume that the different results were caused by the medium composition which varies in factors such as particles background matrix electric conductivity or density 3 6 ex situ versus in situ we found that the amperometric nitrite sensor should be calibrated in situ rather than ex situ the small sensor measured a higher current density ex situ synthetic nitrite solution with an electric conductivity of 16 ms cm than in situ for both calibration curves the offsets were close to 0 a m2 while the slopes were different fig 13 a the experiment was not conducted with the large sensor another experiment showed that the sensor measured the current density of the synthetic nitrite solution with a downward drift over the measurement time of 400 min while the ph and the dissolved oxygen concentration stayed nearly stable fig 13b this suggests that it takes at least 400 min to form an equilibrium between reaction kinetics diffusion and electric field this supports our recommendation to calibrate the sensor in situ 4 discussion 4 1 influence of environmental conditions we found that the effects of temperature ph aeration electric conductivity and dissolved oxygen concentration on the amperometric nitrite sensor are negligible in the assessed range of temperature and ph 22 5 26 5 c and 6 0 7 1 respectively no significant influence was detected furthermore we did not find any dependency on the aeration rate as long as the urine nitrification reactor was aerated neither did a variation in electric conductivity cause any change in the sensor signal at 10 ms cm or more the amperometric nitrite sensor is well suited for urine nitrification since ph temperature and the electric conductivity are usually in ranges for which we did not find any significant influence 4 2 drift while there was no noticeable drift in the ex situ experiments we observed that the amperometric nitrite sensor has a drift in situ i e the sensitivity varies while the offset stays rather stable around 0 a m2 further research is necessary in order to find out whether the sensitivity decreases steadily or whether a seasonal variability can be observed nevertheless we propose that the drift can be compensated for by regular calibration for which a one point calibration may be sufficient we suggest monthly in situ calibration of the amperometric nitrite sensor another option is to quantify and include the drift in process control th√ºrlimann et al 2019 showed that a nitrite sensor prone to offset drift can be used for stabilizing control in urine nitrification by applying qualitative trend analysis note that the amperometric measurement exhibits drift of the sensitivity which one may not be able to account for with qualitative trend analysis 4 3 accuracy of the amperometric nitrite sensor the calibration curves of the in situ experiments for each month resulted in a coefficient of variation of the method vxo that is the standard deviation of the method sxo divided by the mean concentration of 17 or less for the nitrite concentration range of 0 50 mgn l in comparison according to hach lange gmbh spectrophotometric cuvette tests have a vxo of 3 for the range of 0 6 6 0 mgn l lck 342 hach lange gmbh germany and for the range of 0 015 0 6 mgn l lsk 341 hach lange gmbh germany as expected the amperometric nitrite sensor signal is not as accurate as lab based measurements however the sensor is especially valuable as an automated on line measurement 4 4 strengths and weaknesses of sensors for nitrite measurement to our knowledge there exist three measurement principles that have been tested for on line nitrite measurement in wastewater two of these are available commercially in the form of nitrite analyzers colorimetric measurement principle and spectrophotometric sensors light absorbance measurement principle a third principle amperometric measurement is tested for the first time in this work analyzers have the particular advantage of providing measurements that can be unbiased precise and drift free one disadvantage is that this measurement is produced ex situ with a measurement cycle that lasts 10 20 min thus leading to delay that may be significant for process control purposes this also means the measurement frequency is fairly low even more important is that significant maintenance efforts are required for this type of equipment this includes upkeep of the sample preparation system e g filter replacement and ensuring that reagents are both fresh and available in sufficient amounts in contrast spectrophotometric instruments can be used in situ do not require sample preparation and can be equipped with self cleaning devices such as pressured air nozzles brushes or wipers this reduces the cost of maintenance while not eliminating it entirely a key advantage of spectrophotometric measurements is that they are sensitive to many compounds this however induces a lack of specificity which is accounted for by specialized knowledge such as the execution of calibration experiments and software tools for information extraction ma≈°iƒá et al 2015 th√ºrlimann et al 2019 the proposed nitrite sensor combines advantages from both analyzers and spectrophotometric measurements it is simultaneously sensitive and specific to nitrite and is expected to require limited maintenance efforts only in addition it can be produced from cheap materials the amperometric nitrite measurement is not yet a mature technology and therefore further testing including sensor and model validation is necessary the observed drift of the sensor s specificity in in situ deployment is the only known detractor at this moment which needs to be quantified and addressed in future research 4 5 application we found that 90 of the data above 5 mgn l have a maximum relative deviation of 20 and 21 for the large and the small sensor respectively the treatment of municipal wastewater requires a precise nitrite control at low concentrations otherwise we risk nitrous oxide production wunderlin et al 2012 as well as exceedance of the effluent discharge limit of 0 3 mgn l for the nitrite concentration gujer 2006 since the relative prediction residuals increase strongly below 5 mgn l see section 3 2 we do not recommend the sensors in the current configuration for nitrite measurement in municipal wastewater treatment where nitrite concentrations below 5 mgn l can already be critical contrary in urine nitrification higher nitrite concentrations are tolerated our calculations suggest that nitrite concentrations of e g 12 mgn l at a ph of 6 0 or 30 mgn l at a ph of 6 8 must not be exceeded in order to prevent nitrite accumulation based on our experience with the sensor we assume that with the amperometric nitrite sensor high nitrite concentrations can be avoided without difficulty therefore we conclude that the sensor is a promising tool for process control of urine nitrification 5 conclusions with standard deviations below 4 mgn l and a minimum linear nitrite range of 0 50 mgn l the amperometric nitrite sensor covers the critical range of nitrite accumulation and is well suited for on line nitrite monitoring and process control in urine nitrification we expect that the current amperometric sensor is also well suitable for controlling nitrification of other high strength nitrogen solutions such as digester supernatant however an increase of the sensitivity is necessary for nitrite control in the mainstream of municipal wastewater treatment drift corrections are necessary but monthly intervals for calibration are sufficient we propose that a one point calibration of the sensitivity is suitable the sensors must be calibrated in situ in urine nitrification the increased nitrite concentrations required for the one point calibration can be triggered by short increases of the inflow declaration of competing interest the authors

19978,nitrification and distillation of urine allow for the recovery of all nutrients in a highly concentrated fertilizer solution however pharmaceuticals excreted with urine are only partially removed during these two process steps for a sustainable and safe application more extensive removal of pharmaceuticals is necessary to enhance the pharmaceutical removal which is already occurring during urine storage nitrification and distillation an adsorption column with granular activated carbon gac can be included in the treatment train we executed a pilot scale study to investigate the adsorption of eleven indicator pharmaceuticals on gac during 74 days we treated roughly 1000 l of pre filtered and nitrified urine spiked with pharmaceuticals in two flow through gac columns filled with different grain sizes we compared the performance of these columns by calculating the number of treated bed volumes until breakthrough and carbon usage rates the eleven spiked pharmaceuticals were candesartan carbamazepine clarithromycin diclofenac emtricitabine hydrochlorothiazide irbesartan metoprolol n4 acetylsulfamethoxazole sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim at the shortest empty bed contact time ebct of 25 min immediate breakthrough was observed in both columns shortly after the start of the experiments strong competition by natural organic material nom could have caused the low pharmaceutical removal at the ebct of 25 min at ebcts of 70 92 and 115 min more than 660 bed volumes could be treated until breakthrough in the column with fine gac the earliest breakthrough was observed for candesartan and clarithromycin on coarse gac only half the number of bed volumes could be treated until breakthrough compared to fine gac the probable reason for the later breakthrough with fine gac is the smaller intraparticle diffusive path length doc and uv absorbance measurements at 265 nm indicated that both parameters can be used as indicators for the breakthrough of pharmaceuticals in contrast to pharmaceuticals and doc the nutrient compounds ammonium nitrate phosphate potassium and sulfate were not removed significantly a comparison with literature values suggests that the amount of gac needed to remove pharmaceuticals from human excreta could be reduced by nearly two orders of magnitude if urine were treated on site instead of being discharged and treated in a centralized wastewater treatment plant graphical abstract image 1 keywords source separation organic micropollutants resource recovery recycling fertilizer carbon usage rate 1 introduction most nutrients from human metabolism are excreted with urine larsen and gujer 1996 separate collection and treatment of urine has therefore been developed as an approach for preventing eutrophication producing a valuable fertilizer and promoting sanitation in areas where no sewer based sanitation is available udert et al 2016 maurer et al 2006 proposed technologies for urine treatment and some of them have been tested in pilot scale udert et al 2015 since the review of maurer et al 2006 several new technologies have been explored such as ammonia stripping in an electrochemical system kuntke et al 2018 or the production of ammonium bicarbonate in a bio electroconcentration system ledezma et al 2017 the list of technologies for urine treatment is constantly growing so far nitrification and distillation of urine is probably the most thoroughly studied and tested technology for fertilizer production from urine fumasoli et al 2016 it allows the recovery and stabilization of all nutrients contained in urine in a highly concentrated fertilizer solution however not only nutrients but also other compounds could be recovered and concentrated such as pharmaceuticals separation of nutrients from pharmaceuticals is relevant to produce a safe fertilizer furthermore on site removal of pharmaceuticals from source separated urine could be an effective way to reduce the discharge of organic micropollutants to the environment based on a literature review lienert et al 2007a estimated that 64 of the active ingredients are excreted with urine and the rest with feces many processes for pharmaceutical removal from urine have been tested all of them in laboratory experiments and most of them with synthetic solutions mimicking fresh or stored urine nevertheless the results allow for a first comparison of the performance on pharmaceutical removal biological processes showed very different degradation efficiencies for various compounds oezel duygan et al in prep examined the fate of twelve pharmaceuticals during aerobic biological treatment and anaerobic storage in the nitrification step during which heterotrophic bacteria also degrade most of the bulk organic compounds udert and w√§chter 2012 atazanavir ritonavir darunavir and clarithromycin were rapidly degraded while others such as emtricitabine trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole n4 acetylsulfamethoxazole diclofenac hydrochlorothiazide atenolol and atenolol acid were only slowly degraded or not affected at all oezel duygan et al in prep after 50 days of storage under anaerobic conditions more than 90 of hydrochlorothiazide was removed while the overall removal for the other compounds was negligible in another study de wilt et al 2016 observed the removal of pharmaceuticals by biodegradation and photolysis with algae growth while nutrients were recovered within the biomass the authors reported high removal 60 100 of diclofenac ibuprofen paracetamol and metoprolol and partial removal 30 and 60 of trimethoprim and carbamazepine advanced oxidation processes with ozone dodd et al 2008 or combinations of uv and h2o2 zhang et al 2015 could only partially remove pharmaceuticals due to the reaction of the oxidants with other compounds of the urine matrix another set of studies tested the effect of membranes on pharmaceutical removal pronk et al 2006 found that nanofiltration nf membranes rejected over 90 of pharmaceuticals from fresh urine however the nf membranes also rejected over 90 of the phosphate thus requiring a subsequent step to separate phosphate from pharmaceuticals by including microfiltration or electrodialysis as a pretreatment step to nanofiltration high pharmaceutical removal and longer operation times were achieved pronk et al 2007 an intensively studied process on phosphorus recovery from urine is struvite precipitation ronteltap et al 2007 escher et al 2006 reported that more than 99 of carbamazepine diclofenac ibuprofen and propranolol remained in the liquid phase so that the phosphorus product struvite contained negligible amounts of these pharmaceuticals in addition the biotests on estrogenicity and baseline toxicity showed that both effects were reduced by 98 in struvite furthermore the two hormones 17Œ± estradiol e2 and 17Œ≤ ethinylestradiol ee2 could not be detected in struvite pharmaceuticals and hormonally active substances are concentrated in the effluent solution of the precipitation process depending on the local regulations further processing of the effluent would be necessary to eliminate the organic micropollutants other researchers tested the adsorption of pharmaceuticals on anion exchange polymer resins landry and boyer 2013 on biochars solanki and boyer 2017 and on powdered activated carbon pac oezel duygan et al in prep results of the experiments with anion exchange polymer resins and biochars showed unwanted side effects such as a co occurring 20 removal of phosphate and nitrogen species solanki and boyer 2017 or a concomitant desorption of chloride landry and boyer 2013 the results of the study by oezel duygan and co workers were promising pac dosage of 200 mg l to biologically treated urine removed 90 of all tested compounds and the results motivated us to investigate pharmaceutical removal on activated carbon in more detail in general activated carbon is a popular adsorbent for pharmaceuticals for several reasons first adsorption has a low energy demand compared for example to oxidation processes second activated carbon can be used in batch or continuous flow reactors third a wide range of reactor configurations are possible including mixed slurry or fixed bed and fourth gac can be used in convenient filter beds with the possibility to be reactivated and reused crittenden et al 1999 any pharmaceutical removal process including adsorption on activated carbon requires regular maintenance such as replacement of the activated carbon to ensure a sufficient removal efficiency regular monitoring can help to optimize the replacement intervals the most accurate measurements include the chemical analysis of micropollutants but this approach is costly and time intensive measuring uv absorbance is a less expensive and simpler method the use of the uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 was proposed by altmann et al 2016a and mailler et al 2016 as a surrogate parameter to predict the overall removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater the dissolved organic carbon concentration doc was also used as indicator for pharmaceutical removal from wastewater by adsorption on pac altmann et al 2014 on gac meinel et al 2015 and on micro grained gac mailler et al 2016 to our knowledge removal of pharmaceuticals from real nitrified urine by adsorption on gac has not been studied before based on results with gac in municipal wastewater e g meinel et al 2015 and pac in nitrified urine oezel duygan et al in prep we set up the research hypothesis that adsorption on gac in a flow through filter allows nearly complete removal of pharmaceuticals from nitrified urine without losing significant amounts of nutrients to test the hypothesis we i determined the individual and the overall removal of eleven pharmaceuticals depending on the run time of the gac filter ii investigated the influence of the ebct on pharmaceutical removal iii investigated the influence of the carbon grain size on pharmaceutical removal iv calculated the treatment efficiency as carbon usage rates cur and compared our results with the efficiency of advanced treatment of municipal wastewater v tested whether nutrients were removed by the adsorption process and vi evaluated whether the doc concentration or uv absorbance are reliable parameters to predict pharmaceutical removal with gac 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup two identical columns were filled with two types of gac with different grain sizes made from coconut shell gcn 830 norit nederland bv 3800 ac amersfoort the netherlands the fine and the coarse gac had grain diameters between 0 6 and 1 0 mm and between 1 4 and 2 4 mm respectively both fractions were retrieved manually by sieving the original material median particle size 1 68 mm with standard sieves for more information on the gac properties see table s 1 in the supporting information si the columns were made of pvc and had the following dimensions total height 1900 mm outer diameter 63 mm inner diameter 53 6 mm and filtration area 22 6 cm2 gac was filled into the columns to a total height of 64 5 and 64 3 cm with 1352 and 1328 g of the wetted coarse and fine gac respectively ball valves made of chromed brass for sampling were located at 5 5 15 5 20 5 and 25 5 cm in the coarse gac column and at 5 3 15 3 20 3 and 25 3 cm in the fine gac column the empty bed contact times ebcts which are calculated by dividing the bed volume of a column section by the volumetric flow were on average 25 70 92 and 115 min table s 2 si samples were taken from the overall cross section with a perforated stainless steel pipe inserted at each sampling height figure s 1 si the pipe and the valve were connected with a reduction nipple made of stainless steel twice a week samples were taken from the influent tank and all sampling points of the columns the columns were wrapped in aluminum foil to prevent activity of phototrophic microorganisms a scheme and picture of the experimental setup can be found fig s 2 si 2 2 operation of the gac columns before starting the experiment the gac columns were backwashed with tap water to remove fine carbon dust with two peristaltic pumps ismatec reglo digital ismatec wertheim germany nitrified urine was added to the upper part of the columns where it infiltrated gravimetrically into the columns the flow rate was controlled by weighing the effluent tanks every 48 h if the flow rate differed by more than 10 the pump rate was manually readjusted to minimize the amount of particles pumped onto the columns the nitrified urine in the influent tank was collected with a floating gauge the two gac columns ran continuously for 74 days and the inflow rates were sufficiently high to ensure that the gac beds were completely submersed during operation about 510 l of nitrified urine were treated in each column during the operation of the gac filters the hydrostatic pressure rose continuously in both columns we assume that this increase was caused by the accumulation of organic material such as biofilm and inorganic material such as fine gac particles inside and on top of the gac bed nevertheless the maximum tolerable head loss was not reached during the 3 months of operation so that backwashing was not necessary at the end of the experiment the supernatant on top of the filter bed had increased to 1460 and 1560 ml for coarse and fine gac respectively fig s 4 si the corresponding head losses were 64 6 and 69 0 cm respectively the pumping rates were adjusted to maintain a constant flow rate of 5 1 0 4 and 5 1 0 5 ml min for coarse and fine gac respectively fig s 4 si the corresponding filter velocity was 0 14 0 01 m h for both columns with a constant flow rate the ebcts were also nearly constant over time fig s 5 si the reynolds numbers re for the columns with fine and coarse gac were 0 08 and 0 17 respectively both values are close to 0 1 which is the recommended minimum re for small scale gac columns mwh 2012 more details are given in section 3 2 of the si the influent ph decreased from 6 9 at the beginning of the experiment to 5 9 at the end after 30 days of operation we decided to measure the ph at all sampling ports during sampling fig s 6 si after the treatment with gac the urine had almost no color or odor fig s 8 si all operational parameters and concentrations in the influent and the effluents are compiled in table s 9 and s 10 2 3 urine and pharmaceuticals we used partially nitrified urine from the pilot plant in eawag s main building as influent for the experiments fumasoli et al 2016 to ensure constant influent concentrations during the experiment we collected the total volume of about 1200 l urine beforehand filtered it with a filter bag pore size 50 Œºm and measured the background pharmaceuticals concentrations cu nitr as the background concentrations of eawag s urine were very low see table 1 we decided to spike a known amount of pharmaceuticals to reach levels to be expected for biologically treated urine later on called reference urine to calculate these levels we made two assumptions first nitrification of urine results in the same relative degradation of pharmaceuticals as in biological treatment of municipal wastewater as seen by oezel duygan et al in prep second urine is 100 times more concentrated than wastewater which is a conservative assumption since typical dilutions are often 200 times or more on average 350 l of wastewater gujer 2007 and 1 25 l of urine udert et al 2006 are produced per person and day to calculate the pharmaceutical concentrations in the reference urine cu ref typical concentrations for biologically treated swiss wastewater cww bio g√∂tz et al 2014 were multiplied with the relative excretion e urine from the human body via urine and multiplied with a dilution factor of 100 see section 2 1 si for the calculation we prepared a concentrated pharmaceutical mix taking the pharmaceutical concentrations already present in the collected urine into account section 2 2 si the mix was added to the urine to reach the expected concentrations of the reference urine cu ref later pharmaceutical concentrations were measured to determine the actual concentrations cu spike the relative excretion rates and concentrations used to calculate the pharmaceutical concentrations in the reference urine cu ref are given in table 1 for this study we decided to examine the removal of the following compounds candesartan can carbamazepine car clarithromycin cla diclofenac dcf emtricitabine emt hydrochlorothiazide hct irbesartan irb metoprolol met n4 acetylsulfamethoxazole nsmx sulfamethoxazole smx and trimethoprim tmp these pharmaceuticals were chosen because they occur in high concentrations in swiss singer et al 2016 and european wastewater loos et al 2013 many of them are also indicator substances selected to evaluate the effectiveness of advanced wastewater treatment in swiss wastewater treatment plants wwtps bourgin et al 2018 the selection includes compounds with a high tendency of adsorption to activated carbon i e car cla dcf hct and met and low tendency of adsorption to activated carbon such as can and smx kovalova et al 2013 2 4 sampling and analysis of general parameters aliquots of 10 ml of which 3 ml were separated for the analysis of pharmaceuticals were taken at each sampling point twice a week during 74 days when taking a sample the first 5 ml were discarded because the dead volume in the valve and the sampling tube was estimated to be 5 ml to minimize the influence of the sampling procedure on the fluid dynamics inside the column sampling ports were opened slowly and only partially the samples were diluted with nanopure water 200 times for anions 100 times for cations and 20 times for dissolved organic carbon and filtered through glass microfiber filters 0 45 Œºm mn gf 5 macherey

were below the loq of the analytical method in most cases the loq was below 2 of the influent concentration except for emt where the loq was up to 20 of the influent concentration if effluent concentrations were below loq the removal was defined as 100 breakthrough of pharmaceuticals was defined as the point when the removal dropped permanently below 98 2 7 calculation of treated bed

coarse and fine gac for complete pharmaceutical removal breakthrough was defined as the time when the pharmaceutical removal dropped permanently below 98 when comparing our results with studies from municipal wastewater treatment we used a treatment goal of 90 pharmaceutical removal because municipal wastewater treatment does not aim for complete pharmaceutical removal 2 8 measurement of uv absorbance uv absorbance measurements were done with a uv vis spectrophotometer agilent cary 60 agilent technologies santa clara united states in the range of 200 800 nm preliminary tests have shown that in nitrified urine it is difficult to use the wavelength of 254 nm which is typically used in wastewater as surrogate for organic compounds nitrate which is present in much higher concentrations in nitrified urine in our case 2080 mg n l than in the effluent of wwtps about 10 mg n l strongly absorbs at wavelengths between 200 and 250 section 5 and figure s 3 si to prevent any influence of changes in the nitrate concentration on uv measurements for details see ma≈°iƒá et al 2015 we chose a slightly higher wavelength of 265 nm for uv vis analysis all samples were diluted by a factor of 10 3 results and discussions 3 1 influence of empty bed contact time for all compounds treated with coarse and fine gac immediate breakthrough occurred at ebcts of 25 min fig 1 and fig 2 respectively based on our results we suggest a minimum ebct of 70 min longer ebcts only result in a small increase of the nbv until breakthrough especially the removal of can and cla the two least adsorbing compounds did hardly increase when the contact times were longer than 70 min although the suggested ebct of at least 70 min is long it is not critical because the volume of the gac column is small compared to the volume of the main treatment step which is the nitrification reactor assuming that the average retention in the nitrification reactor is approximately 3 days fumasoli et al 2016 and assuming an ebct of 70 min for the gac column the required volume for the gac column would be 60 times smaller than for the nitrification reactor this means that the necessary space for the gac treatment is small additional experiments with sampling at ebcts between 25 and 70 min could show whether shorter ebcts than 70 min can also achieve satisfactory removal the recommended ebct for urine treatment is much longer than what is suggested for the treatment of wwtp effluents typical ebcts tested for advanced wastewater treatment range between 15 and 25 min altmann et al 2016b k√•relid et al 2017 and bourgin et al 2018 however ongoing studies on pharmaceutical removal suggest that ebcts at the higher edge that is 25 min are better for an efficient pharmaceutical removal from wwtp effluents wunderlin et al 2017 the fast breakthrough could have been caused by the high content of natural organic matter nom the influent of the nitrified urine had an average doc concentration of 103 20 mg l table s 4 si while the typical doc in the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant is about 5 mg l table s 13 si the very high amount of nom in the influent must have slowed down the adsorption of the pharmaceuticals due to at least two effects first by competing for adsorption sites and second by blocking pores and thereby slowing down surface diffusion worch 2012 the high nom concentrations could also explain why the removal of all pharmaceuticals did not drop to zerofor ebct 25 min and 70 min figs 1 and 2 biodegradation might have removed nom thereby freeing adsorption sites for pharmaceuticals worch 2012 biodegradation of pharmaceuticals could also have caused the persistent pharmaceutical removal in the gac columns bourgin et al 2018 however this effect might only be of minor importance oezel duygan and co workers in prep found that biodegradation of most pharmaceuticals is low in urine nitrification when looking at pharmaceuticals which were also used in this study biodegradability was low for dcf emt hct smx and tri while a high aerobic biodegradability was found for cla 3 2 influence of gac grain size breakthrough occurred later with fine gac than with coarse gac see figs 1 and 2 and figures s 11 to s 15 especially for compounds with a lower tendency for adsorption can and cla we achieved a better removal with fine gac for well adsorbing compounds such as car emt hct met or tmp the influence of the gac grain size was not significant breakthrough of car emt hct and tmp occurred at the same time for coarse and fine gac at about nbv 700 for ebct of 70 min the difference in breakthrough is due to slower mass transfer in the larger particles of the coarse gac according to worch 2012 the intraparticle mass transfer coefficient is reciprocally proportional to the radius of the gac particle consequently fine gac can be expected to have steeper breakthrough curves with later onset compared to coarse gac although breakthrough occurred earlier for coarse gac the measurement data show that the overall surface available for adsorption was probably similar for both grain sizes the nbv until inclination of the breakthrough curve is a measure for the total surface available for adsorption because at this nbv the activated carbon would be completely saturated under ideal conditions that means without limitation by adsorption kinetics worch 2012 for fine and coarse gac the inclination points of the breakthrough curves were reached at about the same nbv e g nbv 1000 at ebct of 70 min for overall pharmaceutical removal see fig 3 the similarity of the available surface for adsorption makes sense if the internal surface is dominating adsorption while the external surface of the fine and coarse gac differed by a factor of 2 5 see section s 7 4 si the total mass of gac and thereby the internal surface in the two columns were about the same see 2 1 experimental setup the internal surface of gac can be assumed to be directly proportional to the mass because ball milling and sieving does not change the specific internal surface aumeier et al 2019 3 3 overall removal of pharmaceuticals the positive effect of fine gac on the elimination is clearly visible for the overall removal of all eleven tested pharmaceuticals see fig 3 table s 11 and table s 12 si for all ebcts breakthrough occurred earlier when coarse gac was used and maximally nbv 487 could be treated with the longest ebct of 115 min if fine gac was used nbv until breakthrough at the longest ebct was almost doubled nbv 758 for the suggested minimum ebct of 70 min breakthrough occurred at nbv 209 for coarse and at nbv 659 for fine gac the total number of treated bed volumes is determined by can and cla for which we obtained significantly lower removal and fast breakthrough see section 3 1 if the removal between the single compounds vary widely the median might be more representative for the overall removal than the average in our case this would increase the time until breakthrough from nbv 209 to 504 for coarse gac at ebct of 70 min the overall removal for coarse and fine gac at the shortest ebct of 25 min is shown in fig s 15 si 3 4 comparison with pharmaceutical removal from municipal wastewater removal of pharmaceuticals is more efficient for nitrified urine than for wwtp effluent according to a comparison of the curs to compare the treatment efficiency in our experiment with literature data we used the data for the column with fine gac at an ebct of 92 min and a removal of 90 the average cur which corresponds to the amount of carbon required to treat 1 l of nitrified urine was 569 mg l table s 18 the average nbv was calculated to be 1040 table s 15 in a study on a german wwtp altmann et al 2016b reported curs between 20 and 30 mg gac l and nbv until breakthrough of 9 000 14 000 for well adsorbing compounds such as car dcf and met and for a treatment goal of 80 reported curs are significantly higher for higher treatment goals swedish researchers reported an average cur of 110 mg l to achieve a 95 removal of pharmaceuticals from wwtp effluent k√•relid et al 2017 for an average removal of organic micropollutants by 80 in swiss wastewaters a cur of 10 20 mg pac l was estimated to be sufficient siegrist et al 2019 to evaluate our results with the adsorptive removal of pharmaceuticals from wwtp effluent we used datasets for the treatment of swiss wwtp effluents from wunderlin et al 2017 and bourgin et al 2018 and calculated nbv and curs for a removal of 90 general information on the influent characteristics and the gac treatment can be found in table s 13 si influent concentrations of pharmaceuticals are compiled in table s 14 si and results of our calculations in table s 15 to s 20 si our calculations showed that the average curs to remove 90 of pharmaceuticals from swiss wwtp effluent range between 95 and 160 mg gac l table s 18 si and the average nbv until breakthrough range between 5800 and 7620 table s 15 si these curs are much lower than for urine and the nbv until breakthrough are substantially higher indicating that the pharmaceutical removal from 1 l municipal wwtp effluent is more efficient if the cur is referred to the doc mass and not to the liquid volume an average cur of 5 5 mg gac mg doc was required for urine treatment which is substantially lower than the curs of 18 29 mg gac mg doc for municipal wastewater table s 19 si however it is possible that the nature of the doc in nitrified urine and thus its affinity to gac is substantially different to the doc in wwtp effluent furthermore the doc concentration in wwtp effluent is much lower about 5 4 mg c l table s 13 than in nitrified urine 103 mg c l table s 13 in order to consider the higher concentrations of pharmaceuticals and doc in nitrified urine compared to wwtp effluent cur can be converted to the mass of gac required per person and day assuming a urine flow of 1 25 l p d udert et al 2006 and a wastewater flow of 350 l p d gujer 2007 with this assumptions we obtain an average gac demand per person and day of 0 71 g p d for nitrified urine and of 33 56 g p d for wwtp effluent section 8 1 si the gac demand for pharmaceutical removal in this example is about 60 times or more than one order of magnitude smaller for urine treatment than for the treatment of wwtp effluent this calculation is based on the assumption that the pharmaceuticals excreted with feces will not contribute substantially to the concentration of dissolved pharmaceuticals in wwtp effluents oezel duygan et al in prep did the same calculation for treatment of nitrified urine with pac and found that at least 10 times less pac is needed compared to treat municipal wastewater 3 5 degradation of pharmaceuticals in the influent tank until the end of the experiments the influent concentration of emt hct and nsmx smx decreased by more than 20 fig s 9 si final degradations of 64 for emt from 2 57 to 0 92 Œºg l 62 for hct from 84 5 to 32 1 Œºg l and 36 for smx nsmx from 11 4 to 7 3 Œºg l were observed the influent tank was a standard intermediate bulk container ibc with no specific protection against light or surrounding air the degradation of these compounds might be a combination of biological and chemical processes biofilm growth on the inside of the container walls was observed at the end of the experiment which indicates biological activity inside the container high removal of hct during storage has been reported but only for stored fresh urine at solution ph of 9 oezel duygan et al in prep further investigations would be necessary to understand pharmaceutical degradation in stored nitrified urine 3 6 influence of gac treatment on ph and nutrient concentrations the solution ph and the concentrations of nutrients like ammonia nitrate phosphate potassium sulfate and other urine compounds such as chloride and sodium are not affected by the gac treatment for relevant ebcts 25 min the overall removal of the urine nutrients and trace compounds in both columns ranges between 5 and 3 fig s16 and si and the absolute difference between influent and effluent ph was 0 05 ph units for the coarse and 0 06 ph units for the fine gac fig s6 and si the changes of nutrients are insignificant considering that the typical standard deviation of the chemical measurements used in our study is 5 these insignificant changes allow the conclusion that no nutrients are lost when pharmaceuticals are removed from nitrified urine by adsorption on gac in contrast phosphorus and nitrogen removal of up to 36 from synthetic fresh urine using different biochars where reported by solanki and boyer 2017 and tarpeh and co workers actually used biochar to recover ammonia from stored urine for fertilizer production tarpeh et al 2017 the high nutrient removal in these two studies could be due to the different chemical speciation in fresh and stored urine and the high ph value in stored urine around ph 9 another reason could be differences in carbon properties our results are in accordance with the study by oezel duygan et al in prep who studied the treatment of nitrified urine with pac for pharmaceutical removal oezel duygan and co workers observed high removal of pharmaceuticals but no removal of urine nutrients for fine gac we observed a local anomaly of the phosphate concentration at the sampling port for ebct 25 min at this point phosphate was removed on average by almost 25 figure s 17 left si the removal was not constant over time but increased continuously with the duration of the experiment the phosphate concentrations correlated with the ph values figure s 17 right si in addition to the drop of the ph value and of the phosphate concentration we observed white stains in the gac bed around the sampling port for ebct 25 min figure s 18 si accompanied by a reduced flow rate during sampling most probably caused by precipitated minerals inside the sampling tube the observations we made at the sampling point for ebct 25 min were most probably due to nitrification by acid tolerant ammonium oxidizing bacteria fumasoli et al 2017 leading to brass corrosion and local precipitation of metal phosphates see section 9 si for a more detailed discussion brass corrosion is also known as dezincification tuck et al 2010 which can release metal ions such as fe al cu and zn dependent on the material composition to test the proposed mechanism we executed batch experiments with the corroded sampling port see section s 9 1 si we found that the phosphate concentration decreased by about 12 if the ph decreased from 6 45 which is typical for nitrified urine to 5 0 figure s 19 si icp oes analysis of the digested precipitates revealed that the solids contained high concentrations of zinc 63 g kg intermediate amounts of cu 3 6 g kg fe 1 45 g kg and ni 1 68 g kg and trace amounts of pb 0 96 g kg figure s 20 si the measurements support our hypothesis that the release of metals by corrosion of brass caused the local drop in phosphate concentration and that the locally observed phosphate removal is is caused by corrosion and precipitation and not by adsorption on activated carbon 3 7 using uv absorbance or doc removal to predict overall removal of pharmaceuticals uv absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 265 nm because at the more commonly used wavelength of 254 nm strong interference with nitrate was observed section 10 si the influent uv265 of 0 31 0 07 au was reduced by the treatment with coarse and fine gac for ebcts longer than 25 min uv265 removal was highest for the longest ebct 115 min and fine gac although the difference to coarse gac and all other ebcts was small fig 4 left results are similar for doc removal although the doc drops already at the beginning of the experiments to about 80 figure s 21 si high uv265 removal was an indication for high overall pharmaceutical removal up to a uv265 removal of 60 overall pharmaceutical removal increased steadily while at higher uv265 removal the overall pharmaceutical removal was already about 100 fig 4 right uv265 removal and overall pharmaceutical removal fig 4 right showed a better correlation than doc removal and overall pharmaceutical removal fig s 22 left si nevertheless both parameters are suitable to give a reliable threshold value above which overall pharmaceutical removal is 100 similar threshold values for treatment of wwtp effluents with activated carbon can be found in the literature for pac and well adsorbing compounds such as car and met it was reported that a uv254 decrease of around 25 indicate a pharmaceutical removal of over 80 whereas a uv254 decrease of over 50 is necessary for 80 removal of weakly adsorbing pharmaceuticals e g ofiomeprol and primidone altmann et al 2016a in our study we observed the similar correlations for uv265 removal for a pharmaceutical removal of more than 80 when excluding the measurements at the lowest ebct of 25 min a uv265 removal of at least 25 is necessary for well adsorbing compounds e g hct tmp while for the weakly adsorbing compounds cla and can a uv265 removal of 50 is needed fig s 23 si a uv265 removal of 40 corresponds to an average pharmaceutical removal in the range of 80 90 our experiments therefore confirm the statement of altmann and co workers who postulated that the correlation of uv absorbance removal and pharmaceutical removal is only minimally affected by the wastewater composition we conclude that measuring uv265 absorbance allows for real time monitoring and control of the flow through columns however it has to be taken into account that in the case of nitrified urine the samples need to be diluted beforehand and corrected for blanks and interferences by nitrate 4 conclusion we could verify the hypothesis that adsorption on gac in a flow through filter removes pharmaceuticals from nitrified urine without losing significant amounts of nutrients i all eleven pharmaceuticals including compounds with high and low tendencies for adsorption on activated carbon were removed the earliest breakthrough was calculated for candesartan can and clarithromycin cla ii complete pharmaceutical removal was achieved for up to 660 bed volumes at an empty bed contact time ebct of 70 min longer ebcts only slightly increased nbv until breakthrough at an ebct of 25 min the removal was insufficient probably due to strong competition with natural organic matter nom ebcts shorter than 70 min might be sufficient but need to be tested preferably in pilot studies iii with fine gac breakthrough occurred later probably due to the shorter intraparticle diffusive path consequently less gac is required to treat the same urine volume when using fine gac iv nearly two orders of magnitude less activated carbon would be needed per person equivalent if pharmaceuticals were removed on site from nitrified urine instead of removing them from the effluent of a centralized wwtp v nutrient removal is negligible in gac treatment of nitrified urine a local drop in phosphate concentration was an experimental artefact due to the corrosion of a brass valve triggered by acidophilic nitrification vi doc and uv265 measurements can provide threshold values indicating complete pharmaceutical removal due to the high concentrations in nitrified urine pre dilution might be

19978,nitrification and distillation of urine allow for the recovery of all nutrients in a highly concentrated fertilizer solution however pharmaceuticals excreted with urine are only partially removed during these two process steps for a sustainable and safe application more extensive removal of pharmaceuticals is necessary to enhance the pharmaceutical removal which is already occurring during urine storage nitrification and distillation an adsorption column with granular activated carbon gac can be included in the treatment train we executed a pilot scale study to investigate the adsorption of eleven indicator pharmaceuticals on gac during 74 days we treated roughly 1000 l of pre filtered and nitrified urine spiked with pharmaceuticals in two flow through gac columns filled with different grain sizes we compared the performance of these columns by calculating the number of treated bed volumes until breakthrough and carbon usage rates the eleven spiked pharmaceuticals were candesartan carbamazepine clarithromycin diclofenac emtricitabine hydrochlorothiazide irbesartan metoprolol n4 acetylsulfamethoxazole sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim at the shortest empty bed contact time ebct of 25 min immediate breakthrough was observed in both columns shortly after the start of the experiments strong competition by natural organic material nom could have caused the low pharmaceutical removal at the ebct of 25 min at ebcts of 70 92 and 115 min more than 660 bed volumes could be treated until breakthrough in the column with fine gac the earliest breakthrough was observed for candesartan and clarithromycin on coarse gac only half the number of bed volumes could be treated until breakthrough compared to fine gac the probable reason for the later breakthrough with fine gac is the smaller intraparticle diffusive path length doc and uv absorbance measurements at 265 nm indicated that both parameters can be used as indicators for the breakthrough of pharmaceuticals in contrast to pharmaceuticals and doc the nutrient compounds ammonium nitrate phosphate potassium and sulfate were not removed significantly a comparison with literature values suggests that the amount of gac needed to remove pharmaceuticals from human excreta could be reduced by nearly two orders of magnitude if urine were treated on site instead of being discharged and treated in a centralized wastewater treatment plant graphical abstract image 1 keywords source separation organic micropollutants resource recovery recycling fertilizer carbon usage rate 1 introduction most nutrients from human metabolism are excreted with urine larsen and gujer 1996 separate collection and treatment of urine has therefore been developed as an approach for preventing eutrophication producing a valuable fertilizer and promoting sanitation in areas where no sewer based sanitation is available udert et al 2016 maurer et al 2006 proposed technologies for urine treatment and some of them have been tested in pilot scale udert et al 2015 since the review of maurer et al 2006 several new technologies have been explored such as ammonia stripping in an electrochemical system kuntke et al 2018 or the production of ammonium bicarbonate in a bio electroconcentration system ledezma et al 2017 the list of technologies for urine treatment is constantly growing so far nitrification and distillation of urine is probably the most thoroughly studied and tested technology for fertilizer production from urine fumasoli et al 2016 it allows the recovery and stabilization of all nutrients contained in urine in a highly concentrated fertilizer solution however not only nutrients but also other compounds could be recovered and concentrated such as pharmaceuticals separation of nutrients from pharmaceuticals is relevant to produce a safe fertilizer furthermore on site removal of pharmaceuticals from source separated urine could be an effective way to reduce the discharge of organic micropollutants to the environment based on a literature review lienert et al 2007a estimated that 64 of the active ingredients are excreted with urine and the rest with feces many processes for pharmaceutical removal from urine have been tested all of them in laboratory experiments and most of them with synthetic solutions mimicking fresh or stored urine nevertheless the results allow for a first comparison of the performance on pharmaceutical removal biological processes showed very different degradation efficiencies for various compounds oezel duygan et al in prep examined the fate of twelve pharmaceuticals during aerobic biological treatment and anaerobic storage in the nitrification step during which heterotrophic bacteria also degrade most of the bulk organic compounds udert and w√§chter 2012 atazanavir ritonavir darunavir and clarithromycin were rapidly degraded while others such as emtricitabine trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole n4 acetylsulfamethoxazole diclofenac hydrochlorothiazide atenolol and atenolol acid were only slowly degraded or not affected at all oezel duygan et al in prep after 50 days of storage under anaerobic conditions more than 90 of hydrochlorothiazide was removed while the overall removal for the other compounds was negligible in another study de wilt et al 2016 observed the removal of pharmaceuticals by biodegradation and photolysis with algae growth while nutrients were recovered within the biomass the authors reported high removal 60 100 of diclofenac ibuprofen paracetamol and metoprolol and partial removal 30 and 60 of trimethoprim and carbamazepine advanced oxidation processes with ozone dodd et al 2008 or combinations of uv and h2o2 zhang et al 2015 could only partially remove pharmaceuticals due to the reaction of the oxidants with other compounds of the urine matrix another set of studies tested the effect of membranes on pharmaceutical removal pronk et al 2006 found that nanofiltration nf membranes rejected over 90 of pharmaceuticals from fresh urine however the nf membranes also rejected over 90 of the phosphate thus requiring a subsequent step to separate phosphate from pharmaceuticals by including microfiltration or electrodialysis as a pretreatment step to nanofiltration high pharmaceutical removal and longer operation times were achieved pronk et al 2007 an intensively studied process on phosphorus recovery from urine is struvite precipitation ronteltap et al 2007 escher et al 2006 reported that more than 99 of carbamazepine diclofenac ibuprofen and propranolol remained in the liquid phase so that the phosphorus product struvite contained negligible amounts of these pharmaceuticals in addition the biotests on estrogenicity and baseline toxicity showed that both effects were reduced by 98 in struvite furthermore the two hormones 17Œ± estradiol e2 and 17Œ≤ ethinylestradiol ee2 could not be detected in struvite pharmaceuticals and hormonally active substances are concentrated in the effluent solution of the precipitation process depending on the local regulations further processing of the effluent would be necessary to eliminate the organic micropollutants other researchers tested the adsorption of pharmaceuticals on anion exchange polymer resins landry and boyer 2013 on biochars solanki and boyer 2017 and on powdered activated carbon pac oezel duygan et al in prep results of the experiments with anion exchange polymer resins and biochars showed unwanted side effects such as a co occurring 20 removal of phosphate and nitrogen species solanki and boyer 2017 or a concomitant desorption of chloride landry and boyer 2013 the results of the study by oezel duygan and co workers were promising pac dosage of 200 mg l to biologically treated urine removed 90 of all tested compounds and the results motivated us to investigate pharmaceutical removal on activated carbon in more detail in general activated carbon is a popular adsorbent for pharmaceuticals for several reasons first adsorption has a low energy demand compared for example to oxidation processes second activated carbon can be used in batch or continuous flow reactors third a wide range of reactor configurations are possible including mixed slurry or fixed bed and fourth gac can be used in convenient filter beds with the possibility to be reactivated and reused crittenden et al 1999 any pharmaceutical removal process including adsorption on activated carbon requires regular maintenance such as replacement of the activated carbon to ensure a sufficient removal efficiency regular monitoring can help to optimize the replacement intervals the most accurate measurements include the chemical analysis of micropollutants but this approach is costly and time intensive measuring uv absorbance is a less expensive and simpler method the use of the uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 was proposed by altmann et al 2016a and mailler et al 2016 as a surrogate parameter to predict the overall removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater the dissolved organic carbon concentration doc was also used as indicator for pharmaceutical removal from wastewater by adsorption on pac altmann et al 2014 on gac meinel et al 2015 and on micro grained gac mailler et al 2016 to our knowledge removal of pharmaceuticals from real nitrified urine by adsorption on gac has not been studied before based on results with gac in municipal wastewater e g meinel et al 2015 and pac in nitrified urine oezel duygan et al in prep we set up the research hypothesis that adsorption on gac in a flow through filter allows nearly complete removal of pharmaceuticals from nitrified urine without losing significant amounts of nutrients to test the hypothesis we i determined the individual and the overall removal of eleven pharmaceuticals depending on the run time of the gac filter ii investigated the influence of the ebct on pharmaceutical removal iii investigated the influence of the carbon grain size on pharmaceutical removal iv calculated the treatment efficiency as carbon usage rates cur and compared our results with the efficiency of advanced treatment of municipal wastewater v tested whether nutrients were removed by the adsorption process and vi evaluated whether the doc concentration or uv absorbance are reliable parameters to predict pharmaceutical removal with gac 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup two identical columns were filled with two types of gac with different grain sizes made from coconut shell gcn 830 norit nederland bv 3800 ac amersfoort the netherlands the fine and the coarse gac had grain diameters between 0 6 and 1 0 mm and between 1 4 and 2 4 mm respectively both fractions were retrieved manually by sieving the original material median particle size 1 68 mm with standard sieves for more information on the gac properties see table s 1 in the supporting information si the columns were made of pvc and had the following dimensions total height 1900 mm outer diameter 63 mm inner diameter 53 6 mm and filtration area 22 6 cm2 gac was filled into the columns to a total height of 64 5 and 64 3 cm with 1352 and 1328 g of the wetted coarse and fine gac respectively ball valves made of chromed brass for sampling were located at 5 5 15 5 20 5 and 25 5 cm in the coarse gac column and at 5 3 15 3 20 3 and 25 3 cm in the fine gac column the empty bed contact times ebcts which are calculated by dividing the bed volume of a column section by the volumetric flow were on average 25 70 92 and 115 min table s 2 si samples were taken from the overall cross section with a perforated stainless steel pipe inserted at each sampling height figure s 1 si the pipe and the valve were connected with a reduction nipple made of stainless steel twice a week samples were taken from the influent tank and all sampling points of the columns the columns were wrapped in aluminum foil to prevent activity of phototrophic microorganisms a scheme and picture of the experimental setup can be found fig s 2 si 2 2 operation of the gac columns before starting the experiment the gac columns were backwashed with tap water to remove fine carbon dust with two peristaltic pumps ismatec reglo digital ismatec wertheim germany nitrified urine was added to the upper part of the columns where it infiltrated gravimetrically into the columns the flow rate was controlled by weighing the effluent tanks every 48 h if the flow rate differed by more than 10 the pump rate was manually readjusted to minimize the amount of particles pumped onto the columns the nitrified urine in the influent tank was collected with a floating gauge the two gac columns ran continuously for 74 days and the inflow rates were sufficiently high to ensure that the gac beds were completely submersed during operation about 510 l of nitrified urine were treated in each column during the operation of the gac filters the hydrostatic pressure rose continuously in both columns we assume that this increase was caused by the accumulation of organic material such as biofilm and inorganic material such as fine gac particles inside and on top of the gac bed nevertheless the maximum tolerable head loss was not reached during the 3 months of operation so that backwashing was not necessary at the end of the experiment the supernatant on top of the filter bed had increased to 1460 and 1560 ml for coarse and fine gac respectively fig s 4 si the corresponding head losses were 64 6 and 69 0 cm respectively the pumping rates were adjusted to maintain a constant flow rate of 5 1 0 4 and 5 1 0 5 ml min for coarse and fine gac respectively fig s 4 si the corresponding filter velocity was 0 14 0 01 m h for both columns with a constant flow rate the ebcts were also nearly constant over time fig s 5 si the reynolds numbers re for the columns with fine and coarse gac were 0 08 and 0 17 respectively both values are close to 0 1 which is the recommended minimum re for small scale gac columns mwh 2012 more details are given in section 3 2 of the si the influent ph decreased from 6 9 at the beginning of the experiment to 5 9 at the end after 30 days of operation we decided to measure the ph at all sampling ports during sampling fig s 6 si after the treatment with gac the urine had almost no color or odor fig s 8 si all operational parameters and concentrations in the influent and the effluents are compiled in table s 9 and s 10 2 3 urine and pharmaceuticals we used partially nitrified urine from the pilot plant in eawag s main building as influent for the experiments fumasoli et al 2016 to ensure constant influent concentrations during the experiment we collected the total volume of about 1200 l urine beforehand filtered it with a filter bag pore size 50 Œºm and measured the background pharmaceuticals concentrations cu nitr as the background concentrations of eawag s urine were very low see table 1 we decided to spike a known amount of pharmaceuticals to reach levels to be expected for biologically treated urine later on called reference urine to calculate these levels we made two assumptions first nitrification of urine results in the same relative degradation of pharmaceuticals as in biological treatment of municipal wastewater as seen by oezel duygan et al in prep second urine is 100 times more concentrated than wastewater which is a conservative assumption since typical dilutions are often 200 times or more on average 350 l of wastewater gujer 2007 and 1 25 l of urine udert et al 2006 are produced per person and day to calculate the pharmaceutical concentrations in the reference urine cu ref typical concentrations for biologically treated swiss wastewater cww bio g√∂tz et al 2014 were multiplied with the relative excretion e urine from the human body via urine and multiplied with a dilution factor of 100 see section 2 1 si for the calculation we prepared a concentrated pharmaceutical mix taking the pharmaceutical concentrations already present in the collected urine into account section 2 2 si the mix was added to the urine to reach the expected concentrations of the reference urine cu ref later pharmaceutical concentrations were measured to determine the actual concentrations cu spike the relative excretion rates and concentrations used to calculate the pharmaceutical concentrations in the reference urine cu ref are given in table 1 for this study we decided to examine the removal of the following compounds candesartan can carbamazepine car clarithromycin cla diclofenac dcf emtricitabine emt hydrochlorothiazide hct irbesartan irb metoprolol met n4 acetylsulfamethoxazole nsmx sulfamethoxazole smx and trimethoprim tmp these pharmaceuticals were chosen because they occur in high concentrations in swiss singer et al 2016 and european wastewater loos et al 2013 many of them are also indicator substances selected to evaluate the effectiveness of advanced wastewater treatment in swiss wastewater treatment plants wwtps bourgin et al 2018 the selection includes compounds with a high tendency of adsorption to activated carbon

were separated for the analysis of pharmaceuticals were taken at each sampling point twice a week during 74 days when taking a sample the first 5 ml were discarded because the dead volume in the valve and the sampling tube was estimated to be 5 ml to minimize the influence of the sampling procedure on the fluid dynamics inside the column sampling ports were opened slowly and only partially the samples were diluted with nanopure water 200 times for anions 100 times for cations and 20 times for dissolved organic carbon and filtered through glass microfiber filters 0 45 Œºm mn gf 5 macherey

and tables s5 and s 6 and s 7 smx was evaluated together with its main metabolite n4 acetyl sulfamethoxazole nsmx because its back transformation during wastewater treatment was observed in several studies letzel et al 2010 and g√∂bel et al 2004 2 6 calculation of pharmaceutical removal and breakthrough the removal of each compound at each sampling time t was calculated by comparing the effluent c eff t and the influent concentration c inf t equation 1 the overall removal of all pharmaceuticals was calculated as arithmetic mean of the single compound removal efficiencies for each sampling time 1 removal 1 c eff t c inf t 100 especially for long ebcts and in the beginning of the experiment when the adsorption capacity of the gac was still high the pharmaceutical effluent concentrations were below the loq of the analytical method in most cases the loq was below 2 of the influent concentration except for emt where the loq was up to 20 of the influent concentration if effluent concentrations were below loq the removal was defined as 100 breakthrough of pharmaceuticals was defined as the point when the removal dropped permanently below 98 2 7 calculation of treated bed volumes and carbon usage rates the number of treated bed volumes nbv can be used to compare the treatment efficiency independent of reactor sizes to calculate nbv the volume of the urine treated vtreated is devided by the bed volume vb of the respective reactor section equation 2 vtreated is calculated by multiplying the flow rate to the adsorber q with the running time t 2 n bv v treated v b q t v b m 3 m 3 to quantify the performance of the gac columns we calculated carbon usage rates cur for a defined treatment goal cur is defined as the mass of gac in the adsorber mgac divided by the volume of treated urine v treated equation 3 3 cur m gac v treated mg gac l cur or nbv are usually given for specific treatment goals in this study we compared the removal of pharmaceuticals with coarse and fine gac for complete pharmaceutical removal breakthrough was defined as the time when the pharmaceutical removal dropped permanently below 98 when comparing our results with studies from municipal wastewater treatment we used a treatment goal of 90 pharmaceutical removal because municipal wastewater treatment does not aim for complete pharmaceutical removal 2 8 measurement of uv absorbance uv absorbance measurements were done with a uv vis spectrophotometer agilent cary 60 agilent technologies santa clara united states in the range of 200 800 nm preliminary tests have shown that in nitrified urine it is difficult to use the wavelength of 254 nm which is typically used in wastewater as surrogate for organic compounds nitrate which is present in much higher concentrations in nitrified urine in our case 2080 mg n l than in the effluent of wwtps about 10 mg n l strongly absorbs at wavelengths between 200 and 250 section 5 and figure s 3 si to prevent any influence of changes in the nitrate concentration on uv measurements for details see ma≈°iƒá et al 2015 we chose a slightly higher wavelength of 265 nm for uv vis analysis all samples were diluted by a factor of 10 3 results and discussions 3 1 influence of empty bed contact time for all compounds treated with coarse and fine gac immediate breakthrough occurred at ebcts of 25 min fig 1 and fig 2 respectively based on our results we suggest a minimum ebct of 70 min longer ebcts only result in a small increase of the nbv until breakthrough especially the removal of can and cla the two least adsorbing compounds did hardly increase when the contact times were longer than 70 min although the suggested ebct of at least 70 min is long it is not critical because the volume of the gac column is small compared to the volume of the main treatment step which is the nitrification reactor assuming that the average retention in the nitrification reactor is approximately 3 days fumasoli et al 2016 and assuming an ebct of 70 min for the gac column the required volume for the gac column would be 60 times smaller than for the nitrification reactor this means that the necessary space for the gac treatment is small additional experiments with sampling at ebcts between 25 and 70 min could show whether shorter ebcts than 70 min can also achieve satisfactory removal the recommended ebct for urine treatment is much longer than what is suggested for the treatment of wwtp effluents typical ebcts tested for advanced wastewater treatment range between 15 and 25 min altmann et al 2016b k√•relid et al 2017 and bourgin et al 2018 however ongoing studies on pharmaceutical removal suggest that ebcts at the higher edge that is 25 min are better for an efficient pharmaceutical removal from wwtp effluents wunderlin et al 2017 the fast breakthrough could have been caused by the high content of natural organic matter nom the influent of the nitrified urine had an average doc concentration of 103 20 mg l table s 4 si while the typical doc in the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant is about 5 mg l table s 13 si the very high amount of nom in the influent must have slowed down the adsorption of the pharmaceuticals due to at least two effects first by competing for adsorption sites and second by blocking pores and thereby slowing down surface diffusion worch 2012 the high nom concentrations could also explain why the removal of all pharmaceuticals did not drop to zerofor ebct 25 min and 70 min figs 1 and 2 biodegradation might have removed nom thereby freeing adsorption sites for pharmaceuticals worch 2012 biodegradation of pharmaceuticals could also have caused the persistent pharmaceutical removal in the gac columns bourgin et al 2018 however this effect might only be of minor importance oezel duygan and co workers in prep found that biodegradation of most pharmaceuticals is low in urine nitrification when looking at pharmaceuticals which were also used in this study biodegradability was low for dcf emt hct smx and tri while a high aerobic biodegradability was found for cla 3 2 influence of gac grain size breakthrough occurred later with fine gac than with coarse gac see figs 1 and 2 and figures s 11 to s 15 especially for compounds with a lower tendency for adsorption can and cla we achieved a better removal with fine gac for well adsorbing compounds such as car emt hct met or tmp the influence of the gac grain size was not significant breakthrough of car emt hct and tmp occurred at the same time for coarse and fine gac at about nbv 700 for ebct of 70 min the difference in breakthrough is due to slower mass transfer in the larger particles of the coarse gac according to worch 2012 the intraparticle mass transfer coefficient is reciprocally proportional to the radius of the gac particle consequently fine gac can be expected to have steeper breakthrough curves with later onset compared to coarse gac although breakthrough occurred earlier for coarse gac the measurement data show that the overall surface available for adsorption was probably similar for both grain sizes the nbv until inclination of the breakthrough curve is a measure for the total surface available for adsorption because at this nbv the activated carbon would be completely saturated under ideal conditions that means without limitation by adsorption kinetics worch 2012 for fine and coarse gac the inclination points of the breakthrough curves were reached at about the same nbv e g nbv 1000 at ebct of 70 min for overall pharmaceutical removal see fig 3 the similarity of the available surface for adsorption makes sense if the internal surface is dominating adsorption while the external surface of the fine and coarse gac differed by a factor of 2 5 see section s 7 4 si the total mass of gac and thereby the internal surface in the two columns were about the same see 2 1 experimental setup the internal surface of gac can be assumed to be directly proportional to the mass because ball milling and sieving does not change the specific internal surface aumeier et al 2019 3 3 overall removal of pharmaceuticals the positive effect of fine gac on the elimination is clearly visible for the overall removal of all eleven tested pharmaceuticals see fig 3 table s 11 and table s 12 si for all ebcts breakthrough occurred earlier when coarse gac was used and maximally nbv 487 could be treated with the longest ebct of 115 min if fine gac was used nbv until breakthrough at the longest ebct was almost doubled nbv 758 for the suggested minimum ebct of 70 min breakthrough occurred at nbv 209 for coarse and at nbv 659 for fine gac the total number of treated bed volumes is determined by can and cla for which we obtained significantly lower removal and fast breakthrough see section 3 1 if the removal between the single compounds vary widely the median might be more representative for the overall removal than the average in our case this would increase the time until breakthrough from nbv 209 to 504 for coarse gac at ebct of 70 min the overall removal for coarse and fine gac at the shortest ebct of 25 min is shown in fig s 15 si 3 4 comparison with pharmaceutical removal from municipal wastewater removal of pharmaceuticals is more efficient for nitrified urine than for wwtp effluent according to a comparison of the curs to compare the treatment efficiency in our experiment with literature data we used the data for the column with fine gac at an ebct of 92 min and a removal of 90 the average cur which corresponds to the amount of carbon required to treat 1 l of nitrified urine was 569 mg l table s 18 the average nbv was calculated to be 1040 table s 15 in a study on a german wwtp altmann et al 2016b reported curs between 20 and 30 mg gac l and nbv until breakthrough of 9 000 14 000 for well adsorbing compounds such as car dcf and met and for a treatment goal of 80 reported curs are significantly higher for higher treatment goals swedish researchers reported an average cur of 110 mg l to achieve a 95 removal of pharmaceuticals from wwtp effluent k√•relid et al 2017 for an average removal of organic micropollutants by 80 in swiss wastewaters a cur of 10 20 mg pac l was estimated to be sufficient siegrist et al 2019 to evaluate our results with the adsorptive removal of pharmaceuticals from wwtp effluent we used datasets for the treatment of swiss wwtp effluents from wunderlin et al 2017 and bourgin et al 2018 and calculated nbv and curs for a removal of 90 general information on the influent characteristics and the gac treatment can be found in table s 13 si influent concentrations of pharmaceuticals are compiled in table s 14 si and results of our calculations in table s 15 to s 20 si our calculations showed that the average curs to remove 90 of pharmaceuticals from swiss wwtp effluent range between 95 and 160 mg gac l table s 18 si and the average nbv until breakthrough range between 5800 and 7620 table s 15 si these curs are much lower than for urine and the nbv until breakthrough are substantially higher indicating that the pharmaceutical removal from 1 l municipal wwtp effluent is more efficient if the cur is referred to the doc mass and not to the liquid volume an average cur of 5 5 mg gac mg doc was required for urine treatment which is substantially lower than the curs of 18 29 mg gac mg doc for municipal wastewater table s 19 si however it is possible that the nature of the doc in nitrified urine and thus its affinity to gac is substantially different to the doc in wwtp effluent furthermore the doc concentration in wwtp effluent is much lower about 5 4 mg c l table s 13 than in nitrified urine 103 mg c l table s 13 in order to consider the higher concentrations of pharmaceuticals and doc in nitrified urine compared to wwtp effluent cur can be converted to the mass of gac required per person and day assuming a urine flow of 1 25 l p d udert et al 2006 and a wastewater flow of 350 l p d gujer 2007 with this assumptions we obtain an average gac demand per person and day of 0 71 g p d for nitrified urine and of 33 56 g p d for wwtp effluent section 8 1 si the gac demand for pharmaceutical removal in this example is about 60 times or more than one order of magnitude smaller for urine treatment than for the treatment of wwtp effluent this calculation is based on the assumption that the pharmaceuticals excreted with feces will not contribute substantially to the concentration of dissolved pharmaceuticals in wwtp effluents oezel duygan et al in prep did the same calculation for treatment of nitrified urine with pac and found that at least 10 times less pac is needed compared to treat municipal wastewater 3 5 degradation of pharmaceuticals in the influent tank until the end of the experiments the influent concentration of emt hct and nsmx smx decreased by more than 20 fig s 9 si final degradations of 64 for emt from 2 57 to 0 92 Œºg l 62 for hct from 84 5 to 32 1 Œºg l and 36 for smx nsmx from 11 4 to 7 3 Œºg l were observed the influent tank was a standard intermediate bulk container ibc with no specific protection against light or surrounding air the degradation of these compounds might be a combination of biological and chemical processes biofilm growth on the inside of the container walls was observed at the end of the experiment which indicates biological activity inside the container high removal of hct during storage has been reported but only for stored fresh urine at solution ph of 9 oezel duygan et al in prep further investigations would be necessary to understand pharmaceutical degradation in stored nitrified urine 3 6 influence of gac treatment on ph and nutrient concentrations the solution ph and the concentrations of nutrients like ammonia nitrate phosphate potassium sulfate and other urine compounds such as chloride and sodium are not affected by the gac treatment for relevant ebcts 25 min the overall removal of the urine nutrients and trace compounds in both columns ranges between 5 and 3 fig s16 and si and the absolute difference between influent and effluent ph was 0 05 ph units for the coarse and 0 06 ph units for the fine gac fig s6 and si the changes of nutrients are insignificant considering that the typical standard deviation of the chemical measurements used in our study is 5 these insignificant changes allow the conclusion that no nutrients are lost when pharmaceuticals are removed from nitrified urine by adsorption on gac in contrast phosphorus and nitrogen removal of up to 36 from synthetic fresh urine using different biochars where reported by solanki and boyer 2017 and tarpeh and co workers actually used biochar to recover ammonia from stored urine for fertilizer production tarpeh et al 2017 the high nutrient removal in these two studies could be due to the different chemical speciation in fresh and stored urine and the high ph value in stored urine around ph 9 another reason could be differences in carbon properties our results are in accordance with the study by oezel duygan et al in prep who studied the treatment of nitrified urine with pac for pharmaceutical removal oezel duygan and co workers observed high removal of pharmaceuticals but no removal of urine nutrients for fine gac we observed a local anomaly of the phosphate concentration at the sampling port for ebct 25 min at this point phosphate was removed on average by almost 25 figure s 17 left si the removal was not constant over time but increased continuously with the duration of the experiment the phosphate concentrations correlated with the ph values figure s 17 right si in addition to the drop of the ph value and of the phosphate concentration we observed white stains in the gac bed around the sampling port for ebct 25 min figure s 18 si accompanied by a reduced flow rate during sampling most probably caused by precipitated minerals inside the sampling tube the observations we made at the sampling point for ebct 25 min were most probably due to nitrification by acid tolerant ammonium oxidizing bacteria fumasoli et al 2017 leading to brass corrosion and local precipitation of metal phosphates see section 9 si for a more detailed discussion brass corrosion is also known as dezincification tuck et al 2010 which can release metal ions such as fe al cu and zn dependent on the material composition to test the proposed mechanism we executed batch experiments with the corroded sampling port see section s 9 1 si we found that the phosphate concentration decreased by about 12 if the ph decreased from 6 45 which is typical for nitrified urine to 5 0 figure s 19 si icp oes analysis of the digested precipitates revealed that the solids contained high concentrations of zinc 63 g kg intermediate amounts of cu 3 6 g kg fe 1 45 g kg and ni 1 68 g kg and trace amounts of pb 0 96 g kg figure s 20 si the measurements support our hypothesis that the release of metals by corrosion of brass caused the local drop in phosphate concentration and that the locally observed phosphate removal is is caused by corrosion and precipitation and not by adsorption on activated carbon 3 7 using uv absorbance or doc removal to predict overall removal of pharmaceuticals uv absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 265 nm because at the more commonly used wavelength of 254 nm strong interference with nitrate was observed section 10 si the influent uv265 of 0 31 0 07 au was reduced by the treatment with coarse and fine gac for ebcts longer than 25 min uv265 removal was highest for the longest ebct 115 min and fine gac although the difference to coarse gac and all other ebcts was small fig 4 left results are similar for doc removal although the doc drops already at the beginning of the experiments to about 80 figure s 21 si high uv265 removal was an indication for high overall pharmaceutical removal up to a uv265 removal of 60 overall pharmaceutical removal increased steadily while at higher uv265 removal the overall pharmaceutical removal was already about 100 fig 4 right uv265 removal and overall pharmaceutical removal fig 4 right showed a better correlation than doc removal and overall pharmaceutical removal fig s 22 left si nevertheless both parameters are suitable to give a reliable threshold value above which overall pharmaceutical removal is 100 similar threshold values for treatment of wwtp effluents with activated carbon can be found in the literature for pac and well adsorbing compounds such as car and met it was reported that a uv254 decrease of around 25 indicate a pharmaceutical removal of over 80 whereas a uv254 decrease of over 50 is necessary for 80 removal of weakly adsorbing pharmaceuticals e g ofiomeprol and primidone altmann et al 2016a in our study we observed the similar correlations for uv265 removal for a pharmaceutical removal of more than 80 when excluding the measurements at the lowest ebct of 25 min a uv265 removal of at least 25 is necessary for well adsorbing compounds e g hct tmp while for the weakly adsorbing compounds cla and can a uv265 removal of 50 is needed fig s 23 si a uv265 removal of 40 corresponds to an average pharmaceutical removal in the range of 80 90 our experiments therefore confirm the statement of altmann and co workers who postulated that the correlation of uv absorbance removal and pharmaceutical removal is only minimally affected by the wastewater composition we conclude that measuring uv265 absorbance allows for real time monitoring and control of the flow through columns however it has to be taken into account that in the case of nitrified urine the samples need to be diluted beforehand and corrected for blanks and interferences by nitrate 4 conclusion we could verify the hypothesis that adsorption on gac in a flow through filter removes pharmaceuticals from nitrified urine without losing significant amounts of nutrients i all eleven pharmaceuticals including compounds with high and low tendencies for adsorption on activated carbon were removed the earliest breakthrough was calculated for candesartan can and clarithromycin cla ii complete pharmaceutical removal was achieved for up to 660 bed volumes at an empty bed contact time ebct of 70 min longer ebcts only slightly increased nbv until breakthrough at an ebct of 25 min the removal was insufficient probably due to strong competition with natural organic matter nom ebcts shorter than 70 min might be sufficient but need to be tested preferably in pilot studies iii with fine gac breakthrough occurred later probably due to the shorter intraparticle diffusive path consequently less gac is required to treat the same urine volume when using fine gac iv nearly two orders of magnitude less activated carbon would be needed per person equivalent if pharmaceuticals were removed on site from nitrified urine instead of removing them from the effluent of a centralized wwtp v nutrient removal is negligible in gac treatment of nitrified urine a local drop in phosphate concentration was an experimental artefact due to the corrosion of a brass valve triggered by acidophilic nitrification vi doc and uv265 measurements can provide threshold values indicating complete pharmaceutical removal due to the high concentrations in nitrified urine pre dilution might be

19979,a leading challenge in drinking water treatment is to remove small sized viruses from the water in a simple and efficient manner multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnt are new generation adsorbents with previously demonstrated potential as filter media to improve virus removal this study therefore aimed to evaluate the field applicability of mwcnt filters for virus removal in water containing natural organic matter nom as co solute to viruses using batch equilibrium experiments contrary to previous studies our results showed with ms2 bacteriophages single solute systems that the affinity of mwcnt for ms2 was low since after 3 h of equilibration only 4 log10 reduction value lrv of ms2 20 ml at an initial concentration of 106 pfu ms2 ml were reached single solute experiments with suwannee river nom srnom performed with environmentally relevant concentrations showed mwcnt surface saturation at initial srnom concentrations between 10 and 15 mgc l for water ph between 5 2 and 8 7 these results suggested that at nom virus ratios found in natural waters the nom would competitively suppress virus adsorption onto mwcnt even at low nom concentrations we confirmed this expectation with srnom ms2 co solute experiments which showed an exponential decrease of the ms2 lrv by mwcnt with an increase in the initial srnom concentration more interestingly we showed that pre equilibrating mwcnt with a srnom solution at a concentration as low as 0 4 mgc l resulted in a lrv decrease of 3 for ms2 due to the formation of a negatively charged srnom adlayer on the mwcnt surface complementary batch experiments with natural nom containing waters and competition experiments with srnom in the presence of cacl2 confirmed that the presence of nom in waters challenges virus removal by mwcnt filters irrespective of the concentration and type of nom and also in the presence of ca2 we therefore conclude that mwcnt filters produced with commercially available pristine mwcnt cannot be considered as a viable technology for drinking water virus removal graphical abstract image 1 keywords multiwalled carbon nanotubes virus treatment natural organic matter competitive adsorption drinking water 1 introduction viruses are responsible for a large share of the global burden of respiratory and diarrheal infectious diseases kotloff et al 2012 and can be responsible for major outbreaks one major challenge to reduce mortality from waterborne viruses is the efficient removal of viruses in drinking water in low and middle income countries a promising strategy to prevent virus waterborne diseases are point of use pou treatments deployed in households and within communities in these decentralized water facilities water treatment technologies selected have low costs and maintenance but are sustainable and easy to use peter varbanets et al 2009 however many conventional water treatment processes implemented in the context of pou may have minimal impact on virus removal or inactivation for example microfiltration and ultrafiltration is largely ineffective in removing viruses due to their small size tanneru et al 2013 to meet the local operation requirements and an adequate virus removal new processes urgently need to be developed rahaman et al 2012 carbon nanotubes cnt are broadly considered promising materials for future water treatment applications including filtration and or adsorption the unique features of cnt include high surface areas hydrophobicity porosity rapid adsorption kinetics simple regeneration techniques and good mechanical and thermal stability as a result cnt are promising alternatives to traditional adsorbents elsehly et al 2018 sarkar et al 2018 shimizu et al 2018 since the invention of cnt scientists have shown that these materials have antimicrobial properties can be used for removal of heavy metals and organic pollutants by complexation and adsorption respectively sun et al 2012 smith and rodrigues 2015 studies have further suggested that cnt are also capable to remove viruses brady est√©vez et al 2010b demonstrated that a filter composed of a mixture of single walled carbon nanotubes swcnt and multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnt reached a virus log10 removal value lrv of 6 for ms2 prd1 and t4 bacteriophages at a flux through the filter of 160 l m2 h in another study ms2 removal by a mwcnt filter was between 5 and 8 lrv at low pressure and lrv was higher than what was achieved using a swcnt filter brady est√©vez et al 2010a 2010c the higher removal observed for mwcnt filters was ascribed to physical retention of ms2 by the entangled cnt network that was deposited onto the filter in combination with ms2 adsorption onto mwcnt numerous virus sorbent interaction forces are expected to drive ms2 adsorption onto mwcnt given that mwcnt are largely apolar hydrophobic they tend to form aggregates and bundles with apolar internal cavities to the surface of which ms2 may adsorb by the hydrophobic effect chandler 2005 armanious et al 2016a in addition van der waals vdw forces which operate at short virus surface separation distances contribute to ms2 mwcnt interactions overall the past work supports the potential of mwcnt filters to complement existing water purification technologies that are already used in low and middle income countries for households or water kiosks drinking water treatment under field conditions however natural water sources contain particles in suspension and colloids 45 Œºm that can affect the efficiency of the mwcnt filters by clogging the filter applying a first pre filtration step like gravity driven membrane gdm filtration would eliminate the potential interference from suspended particles pronk et al 2019 however this pre filtration step is not removing natural organic matter nom which is smaller than virions nom is ubiquitous in water and has also a high affinity to mwcnt surfaces hyung and kim 2008 ateia et al 2017 shimizu et al 2018 the high affinity of nom for mwcnt might be a drawback for virus removal by mwcnt filters as observed brady est√©vez et al 2010c using a mwcnt filter the authors observed that ms2 lrv by mwcnt filter decreased from 5 6 to 0 17 1 in presence of srnom or alginate at concentrations higher than 1 mg l the authors hypothesized that nom likely competed with the virus for adsorption sites in the mwcnt surface it is likely that the decrease in ms2 lrv in the presence of nom was due to the formation of a negatively charged nom adlayer that electrostatically repelled ms2 from the surface given that ms2 is negatively charged at circumneutral ph i e isoelectric point of the virus iep 3 9 armanious et al 2016b used quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation qcm d monitoring to directly demonstrate electrostatic repulsion of ms2 from nom adlayers that formed on a positively charged surface self assembled monolayers of alkyl thiols formed from ethanolic solution of cysteamine sam nh3 at ph iep of ms2 nonetheless brady est√©vez et al 2010c reported that nom supposedly had a negligible negative effect on virus removal by mwcnt filter when treating water samples with nom concentrations below 1 mg l the authors concluded that mwcnt filter technology was a cost effective technology for point of use virus removal in low nom waters the study therefore assumed that there is a threshold concentration of nom below which virus removal by mwcnt filters remains unaffected however the threshold observed in this study could also be explained by a short contact time of the nom with the filter surfaces during filtration resulting in a limited co adsorption effect at low nom concentrations indeed armanious et al 2014 showed using qcm d adsorption studies that continuously supplying nom even at very low concentrations to positively charged adsorbent surface resulted in nom adsorption until the entire adsorbent surface was saturated armanious et al 2014 questions the notion of a critical nom threshold concentration in solution below which virus removal from the same solution is not affected as suggested by brady est√©vez et al 2010c another important aspect in assessing the applicability of mwcnt filters as an efficient and innovative solution for point of use virus removal is to study potential effects of the ionic composition of the solution on ms2 removal and nom competition brady est√©vez et al 2010c and brady est√©vez et al 2008 showed that increasing the ionic strength is by adding nacl increased ms2 removal by cnt filters due to the suppression of repulsive electrostatic forces between viruses and cnt other studies showed that divalent and trivalent cations could increase the adsorption of ms2 to surfaces pumpens 2020 reported that ms2 was found to adsorb on anionic clay like nanocomposites together with zn2 mg2 and al3 higher adsorption of ms2 to sandy loam soil in presence of oxidized metal ions like ferric oxihydroxides was noted by witzany 2010 farrah 1982 showed that the presence of magnesium increased ms2 adsorption to membrane filters while brady est√©vez et al 2010c showed that it decreased the virus removal by mwct filters finally brady est√©vez et al 2010c showed that adding cacl2 improved ms2 virus removal by mwcnt filters in presence of nom nom competitive effect mitigation during virus removal by mwcnt filters in presence of ca2 may result from ca2 forming cationic bridges between negatively charged carboxylate and phenolate groups in the nom adlayer and the negatively charged amino acids on the ms2 virion surface the cation bridges formation would increase ms2 adsorption through the formation of nom ca2 ms2 complexes as compared to ca2 free solutions thereby overcoming direct ms2 nom electrostatic repulsion kalinichev et al 2011 kloster et al 2013 evidence in support of cation bridges was also reported by pham et al 2009 who showed higher attachment efficiency of ms2 onto the srnom adlayers in presence of ca2 amongst all ions present in natural waters the competition mitigation effect observed in presence of ca2 is of major interest since it might allow using mwcnt filters to remove viruses from natural waters containing high calcium concentrations however there is a research gap concerning the adsorption mechanisms of ms2 onto mwcnt and the effect of nom as co solute and the presence of ca2 to critically evaluate the field application of mwcnt filters for virus removal the goal of our work was to experimentally assess the competitive co adsorption between ms2 bacteriophages and nom to mwcnt this information is critical to inform the feasibility of using mwcnt as adsorbent to produce filters to remove virus from waters that contain different types and concentrations of nom and or ionic compositions to do so we studied adsorption of ms2 bacteriophages to mwcnt in batch reactors both in the absence and presence of nom as co adsorbate ms2 bacteriophages were used as a surrogate for apolar and negatively charged enteric viruses of human health concern such as adenovirus shi et al 2016 furthermore ms2 bacteriophage is a virus surrogate recommended by the world health organization who to evaluate virus removal of household water treatment options world health organization 2011 and it was used in previous studies investigating the virus removal by cnt filters allowing for better comparability between studies brady est√©vez et al 2010b 2010c briefly batch experiments with ms2 were performed to estimate the minimum mass of mwcnt required to reach at least an ms2 lrv of 4 in line with the recommendation of the u s environmental protection agency us epa 2015 subsequently we performed single solute batch adsorption experiments with ms2 and srnom to evaluate at which concentrations these two solutes saturated the mwcnt surface this information is critical to assess competitive effects in co solute systems then we assessed competitive co adsorption to mwcnt in batch adsorption experiments containing both ms2 and srnom at different concentration ratios finally for a more environmentally realistic assessment of the potential of mwcnt filters for virus removal we used natural waters in batch experiments and determined the effect of ca2 on ms2 removal in srnom ca2 batch experiments the results from this work inform on the efficacy of mwcnt to produce virus filters a necessary first step toward application in the field for drinking water treatment 2 material and methods multiwalled carbon nanotubes mwcnt were purchased from cheaptubes lot number 180320 usa the mwcnt had a specific surface area of 117 m2 g their length and outer diameter were equal to 10 30 Œº m and 20 30 nm respectively metallic impurities in mwcnt were determined by icp ms after digestion of the mwcnt for 2 h in hno3 65 and h2o2 details about metal impurities are provided in the supplementary information table s1 prior to use mwcnt in batch adsorption experiments mwcnt were bath sonicated in ethanol i e 100 mg mwcnt in 20 ml ethanol 35 hz 120 w 5min the resulting suspension was subsequently vacuum filtered onto 0 1 Œº

total carbon analyzer shimadzu japan calcium stock solutions were prepared dissolving cacl2 in buffer solution to obtain three different ca2 concentrations 0 1 mmol l 1 9 mmol l and 7 5 mmol l respectively to demonstrate the transferability of the results obtained with the model nom to nom in natural water samples we also determined ms2 adsorption to mwcnt in water samples that we collected from four different sources tap water ground water river water and wastewater treatment plant secondary effluent we collected these water samples at eawag d√ºbendorf switzerland more specifically river and ground water were collected from the sampling stations of chriesbach river and the local aquifer respectively the secondary effluent was sampled from eawag s pilot scale wastewater treatment plant outlet after collection the samples were filtered through sterile 0 45 Œº m pes filters sartorius germany to remove particulates before using the water samples in batch adsorption experiments doc and ca2 concentrations of these waters were quantified by toc l total carbon analyzer shimadzu japan and ion chromatography metrohm 930 compact ic flex respectively batch experiments adsorption of ms2 and nom onto mwcnt was studied both in single solute and co solute batch reactor setups and performed in duplicate all batch reactor experiments were set up by weighing a known mass of mwcnt in 50 ml carbon free glass vials muffled at 450 c for 4 h followed by adding the targeted solution 20 ml as shown in table 1 ph values and doc ca2 concentrations used in our study are based on a literature review we have made from 85 studies that reported water chemistry characteristics of natural water samples from 42 countries the data from the literature review were used to calculate average upper and lower values 5th and 95th percentiles thereby capturing the range of values found in natural waters that can be used as a drinking water source the references of these studies are available in supplementary information section 4 based on the results of adsorption kinetic experiments fig s1 and fig s2 in supplementary information the batch equilibration time was set to 3 h after 3 h mixing at 40 rpm with a rotating mixer at room temperature the samples were filtered through sterile 0 45 Œº m pes filters syringe sartorius germany and the filtrate was further analyzed for batch experiments aiming to study virus removal by mwcnt with and without nom co solutes a blank reactor with ms2 solution was included to determine ms2 concentrations after 3 h mixing this blank was used to determine the concentration of virus available for adsorption onto mwcnt ci and thus accounted for any potential dilution variability decay and adsorption to the glass vial during the batch experiment decreases in the blanks were between 9 and 66 5 or between 9 104 and 7 105 pfu ml depending on the experiment a reactor with 15 mg mwcnt in buffer solution was also ran as a blank for single solute srnom adsorption experiments in order to quantify the amount of doc that leached from the mwcnt this doc value docb was then subtracted from the doc value measured after the single solute batch experiment with srnom and mwcnt docf in order to estimate the srnom adsorbed mass per mass of mwcnt as described in equation 1 1 q e s r n o m d o c i d o c f d o c b v m m w c n t where

and cell cultures braunsch weig germany ms2 stock solution was prepared at the beginning of the study by amplifying ms2 commercial stock solution in 1 l of e coli culture after the amplification step the culture was filtered over a 0 22 Œºm pes vacuum filter membrane to remove e coli cells cell removal prevents any proliferation of ms2 during the batch adsorption experiments following filtration we additionally purified the virus stock solution using centrifugal membrane filters amicon ultra 15 merk millipore germany before using the ms2 solution in experiments it was previously shown that the additional centrifugal membrane filtration step is critical to remove lower molecular weight organics that may heavily interfere with ms2 adsorption to sorbent surfaces armanious et al 2016a the double agar layer assay was used to enumerate infectious bacteriophages pfu ml us epa method 1602 2001 pitol et al 2017 briefly 100 Œº l of sample containing ms2 were mixed with 200 Œº l of e coli

adsorption batch experiment in the presence of mwcnt to evaluate mwcnt ms2 adsorption capacity and compare it to the srnom adsorption capacity the adsorbed mass of ms2 per mass of mwcnt qe total virions mg mg was calculated considering that the total number of ms2 capsids in solution is higher than the total number of pfu given that not all virions are infective fig 1 armanious et al 2016a the ratios between the different ms2 subpopulations i e rinfectious virions rna virions 0 04 and rrna virions total virions 0 93 combined with the pfu ml concentration measured with the double layer assay were used to calculate the number of rna virions and rna free virions referring to individual virions with and without rna in the assembled capsid respectively these values were taken from the table provided in supporting information of armanious et al 2016a even if these values might be different from one study to another due to different propagation and purification protocols we used armanious et al 2016a ratios as approximation for our work indeed the mwcnt surface loading by ms2 would not be fundamentally impacted if the ratios are different briefly the number of infectious virions adsorbed onto mwcnt during batch experiment ninfectious virions was calculated using equation 3 3 n i n f e c t i o u s v i r i o n s r i n f e c t i o u s v i r i o n s p l a q u e f o r m i

based on the number of virions calculated for the subgroups and on the molar mass of a molecule of rna mrna 1 83 10 18 g and a single capsid mcapsid 4 18 10 18 g the mass of virions adsorbed per mass

with organic carbon and organic nitrogen detectors lc ocd ond analysis the nom in the different water samples used for the co adsorption batch experiments were characterized by size using lc ocd ond this method allows to separate nom molecules into major fractions of different sizes and chemical functions and to quantify them on the basis of organic carbon concentration to do so each sample was passed through a size exclusion chromatographic column from tosoh toyopearl tsk hw 50s 250 20 mm with a separation range of 20 kda 100da phosphate buffer 24 mm ph 6 6 was used as eluent and the flow rate was set at 1 ml min after the chromatographic column the flow was split into a gr√§ntzel thin film reactor c compounds oxidation and a special donox reactor n compounds oxidation not further described herein as it was not used the upper part of the gr√§ntzel thin film reactor was shielded from the uv bulb to allow stripping of the co2 present in water after mixing the sample with phosphoric acid 60 mm ph 1 2 then the sample was exposed to uv light in the lower part of the gr√§ntzel thin film reactor to produce hydroxyl radical oh c compounds were fully oxidized by hydroxyl radicals to co2 which was subsequently analyzed with a siemens ir detector more detailed information on lc ocd ond is available in huber et al 2011 the obtained chromatograms are divided in five

described in huber et al 2011 3 results and discussion evaluation of the minimum mwcnt mass to comply with epa standards for virus removal to estimate the minimum mass of mwcnt required to reach a 4 lrv and thus comply with the epa standards for virus removal us epa 2015 and to understand the ph effect on ms2 adsorption onto mwcnt we determined ms2 lrv as a function of increasing mwcnt mass at three experimental ph of 5 2 7 7 and 8 7 fig 2 as depicted in fig 2 ms2 lrv was linearly correlated to the mass of mwcnt used in the batch experiments confirming that mwcnt present ms2 adsorption sites a multiple linear regression was calculated to evaluate both effects of mwcnt mass and ph on ms2 lrv description of the model in section 3 of supplementary information a significant regression equation was found f 3 64 473 1 p 2 2 10 16 with a r2 of 0 955 ms2 lrv was significantly influenced by mwcnt mass beta 0 29 p 2 10 16 but neither ph 7 7 beta 0 04 p 0 6 nor ph 8 7 beta 0 04 p 0 6 were statistically significant relative to ph 5 2 this finding strongly suggests that the higher the mwcnt mass the higher the ms2 lrv as visible in fig 2 while ph did not significantly affect ms2 adsorption to mwcnt over the tested ph from 5 2 to 8 7 the effect of ph on adsorption mechanisms is observed if a significant change in the net surface charge occurs over the ph range tested in our study the negligible effect of ph on ms2 removal by mwcnt is due to the fact that both ms2 and mwcnt surfaces charge were not changed and were mainly negative over the tested ph range specifically most ms2 capsid amino acids have a pka lower than 4 5 aspartic acid glutamic acid or higher than 10 lysine armanious et al 2016a and mwcnt are negatively charged at ph higher than 2 4 5 due to the presence of acidic groups such as carboxylic acid moieties pka 4 5 lu and su 2007 michen and graule 2010 wang et al 2011 singh et al 2012 skwarek et al 2016 nonetheless electrostatic repulsion is not a major limitation to ms2 mwcnt adsorption mechanisms because acidic groups have a low surface density on mwcnt yudianti et al 2011 sun et al 2014 and they are mainly located at mwcnt tips mcclory et al 2010 krishnakumar et al 2012 furthermore other interaction forces such as œÄ œÄ interactions hydrogen bounding and hydrophobic effect can overcome electrostatic repulsion armanious et al 2016a demonstrated through qcm d experiments the hydrophobic effect role in the adsorption of ms2 on surfaces based on past studies and our batch experiments results we therefore hypothetize that ms2 primarily adsorbed through hydrophobic effect to the apolar patches present at the mwcnt surface with ms2 having a positive hydrophathy index chandler 2005 armanious et al 2016a given that the multiple linear regression showed that ph had no significant effect on ms2 lrv a single linear regression was calculated from all data points from the batch experiments conducted at ph 5 2 7 7 and 8 7 to predict the ms2 lrv based on mwcnt mass fig 2 a significant regression equation was found f 1 16 631 1 p 2 8 10 14 with a r2 of 0 974 ms2 lrv predicted is equal to 0 14 0 28 mwcnt mass when mwcnt mass is measured in milligrams at an initial ms2 concentration of 106 pfu ml ms2 lrv increased by 0 28 for each mg of mwcnt over the ph range tested fig 2 shows that a minimum mass of 15 mg mwcnt was required to reach the 4 lrv of ms2 as imposed by epa regulations us epa 2015 notably because ms2 lrv was linearly correlated with mwcnt mass in the ph range tested higher levels of virus lrv are expected by increasing mass of mwcnt these results are in accordance with other studies that showed higher virus removal efficiency with increasing cnt mass onto filters brady est√©vez et al 2010b park and hwang 2014 we note that brady est√©vez et al 2010c used a lower amount of mwcnt of 3 mg per filter at a water chemistry 10 mm nacl and ph 5 5 that was similar to what we used here but obtained 5 38 0 80 lrv for ms2 this higher removal in that study as compared to our values likely resulted from the use of a different mwcnt material in brady est√©vez et al 2010c nanotechlabs inc 17 9 nm diameter 91 21 Œº m length mwcnt properties vary between suppliers and even batches poulsen et al 2015 2016 glomstad et al 2016 showed that cnt adsorption capacity of phenanthrene was distinct between two types of mwcnt while brady est√©vez et al 2010c reported a higher ms2 removal with a mwcnt filter than with a swcnt filter another factor that can explain the difference between our results and those of brady est√©vez et al 2010c is that the filtration experiments conducted by brady est√©vez et al 2010c combined ms2 physical retention by the entangled mwcnt layer with adsorption on mwcnt while we only assessed ms2 adsorption to mwcnt in our experimental setup however in regards to the drastic ms2 lrv decrease observed by brady est√©vez et al 2010c during the filtration of virus in co solute systems it can be hypothesized that adsorption was the main pathway by which virus was removed from water by mwcnt filters ms2 adsorption onto mwcnt is expected to be largely driven by the hydrophobic effect as mentioned above concentration dependent adsorption of ms2 by mwcnt the effect of initial ms2 concentration on ms2 adsorption by mwcnt was studied to evaluate if mwcnt saturation by ms2 could be reached at a mass of 15 mg mwcnt information on the maximum adsorbed mass or number of ms2 capsids per mass of mwcnt would allow estimating the volume of virus free filtered water that can be obtained from one mwcnt filter assuming a human virus concentration of 103 pfu l or 101 103 gene copy l in river water and that these viruses adsorb similarly to ms2 haramoto et al 2010 hamza et al 2011 goh et al 2019 the adsorbed mass of ms2 per mass of mwcnt was therefore plotted as a function of ms2 initial concentration as shown in fig 3 a single linear regression was calculated to predict the adsorbed mass of ms2 per mass of mwcnt based on the initial ms2 concentration fig 3 a significant regression equation was found f 1 3 2 5 104 p 5 6 10 7 with a r2 of 0 999 the adsorbed mass of ms2 per mass of mwcnt predicted is equal to 2 1 10 4 1 6 10 10 ms2 initial concentration when ms2 initial concentration is measured in pfu ml the adsorbed mass of ms2 per mass of mwcnt increased by 1 6 10 10 mg g per pfu ml of ms2 at the maximum initial ms2 concentration tested i e 109 pfu ml the adsorbed mass of ms2 per mass of mwcnt was 0 16 0 002 mg g corresponding to a total capsid number of 4 1011 4 109 adsorbed per 15 mg corresponding to a mwcnt surface area of 1 75 104 cm2 based on the ms2 capsid diameter of approximately 28 8 nm we estimated that at an initial ms2 concentration of 109 pfu ml the total number of virions adsorbed to the mwcnt covered a surface of 2 6 cm2 corresponding to only 0 015 of the mwcnt total surface this is approximately 2000 times lower than the hypothetical maximum surface coverage i e 24 40 of surface covered by ms2 if one assumes random sequential adsorption of individual ms2 virions up to the surface jamming limit following armanious et al 2016a we note that in the same study adsorption of ms2 leveled off at a concentration of approximately 1800 ng cm2 while in our study the highest adsorbed ms2 concentration was only 0 13 ng cm2 at a ms2 concentration of 109 pfu ml the differences in the adsorbed mass solely reflect the different experimental set ups for adsorption in both studies in armanious et al 2016a ms2 was continuously delivered at a constant virus inflow concentration over a qcm d sensor until the jamming limit of ms2 on the sensor surface was reached in our study the initial ms2 concentration was significantly smaller than the concentration that would have been needed to reach the jamming limit i e 1012 pfu ml calculated from armanious et al 2016a maximum surface coverage and mwcnt surface area available for adsorption furthermore reduction in surface area available for ms2 adsorption due to mwcnt aggregation and or bundle formation was not accounted for in our calculation it is therefore difficult to predict the maximum amount or mass of virus that can be adsorbed per mass of mwcnt but fig 3 shows that even with an initial concentration of 109 pfu ml the jamming limit of mwcnt surface was not reached concentration dependent adsorption of srnom to mwcnt natural waters containing viruses also contain nom as a co solute that may interfere with virus removal by mwcnt filters as already observed by brady est√©vez et al 2010c it is therefore critical to assess the effect of initial nom concentration on nom adsorption onto mwcnt to evaluate the potential nom competitive co adsorption effect with viruses to do so we conducted single solute nom adsorption experiments onto mwcnt at varying initial nom concentrations the resulting adsorbed amounts of nom per mass of mwcnt are plotted as a function of the initial doc concentration in fig 4 fig 4 shows that for low initial doc concentrations the adsorbed mass of srnom per mass of mwcnt increased as the initial doc concentration increased for higher initial doc concentrations contrary to what was observed with ms2 fig 3 the adsorbed mass of srnom per mass of mwcnt attained a threshold suggesting that surface saturation of mwcnt was reached the maximum adsorbed mass of srnom per mass of mwcnt was 20 7 1 22 mgc g and 22 6 0 37 i e an adsorbed mass per surface of mwcnt equals to 17 7 ngc cm2 and 19 3 ngc cm2 respectively at ph 7 7 and 8 7 respectively these values are in agreement with jeong et al 2017 who reported a saturation concentration around 20 mgc g after batch experiments with mwcnt and srnom œÄ œÄ interactions electrostatic interactions hydrogen bonding and the hydrophobic effect are the main driving forces srnom mwcnt interactions ateia et al 2017 in contrast to ms2 the adsorption of srnom to mwcnt was ph dependent the maximum adsorbed mass of srnom per mass of mwcnt at ph 5 2 was 29 9 0 5 mgc g and higher than the value measured at ph 7 7 and 8 7 the higher adsorption of srnom to mwcnt at the lower tested ph likely resulted from srnom being less negatively charged at this ph and thus possibly adopting a more compact conformation and consequently denser packing on the mwcnt surface as compared to the higher ph adoption of a more compact conformation of ha assemblies in solution at lower ph was previously demonstrated for suwannee river humic acid srha by photon correlation spectroscopy pcs i e the hydrodynamic diameter of the assemblies decreased from approximately 60 nm 10 nm when decreasing the ph from 7 5 to 4 5 at constant is 10 mm baalousha et al 2006 the more compact conformation and denser packing can be explained by weaker intra and inter molecular electrostatic repulsion in and between srnom assemblies on the sorbent surface as previously reported in armanious et al 2014 and de melo et al 2016 higher adsorption of nom to cnt at lower ph was also observed by engel and chefetz 2016 who reported that the saturation value of dissolved organic matter from composted biosolids on swcnt was approximately 1 8 times higher at ph 4 than at ph 7 and ph 10 to calculate the surface coverage of mwcnt by srnom we assumed that the representative formula of a nom assembly is c9h9no6 i e 1 79 10 19 mgc that assemblies can be modeled as rigid spheres having a diameter of 1 nm armanious et al 2016b and that all mwcnt surface area is available for adsorption at ph 7 7 we therefore calculated that 78 of the mwcnt surface was covered by srnom when the maximum adsorbed mass of srnom per mass of mwcnt was reached i e 20 7 1 22 mgc g fig 4 yet mwcnt tend to form bundles and aggregates 78 of surface coverage might correspond to a saturation of all mwcnt adsorption sites available the mwcnt surface coverage value obtained for srnom is 5 106 times higher than the surface coverage of ms2 on mwcnt that we calculated for the experiment conducted at the highest tested initial ms2 concentration i e 109 pfu ml even for initial doc concentrations where mwcnt surface saturation by srnom was not reached mwcnt surface coverage by srnom was significantly higher than the surface coverage observed for ms2 irrespectively the initial ms2 concentration indeed at low srnom concentration i e 2 5 mgc l the calculated mwcnt surface coverage by adsorbed srnom was approximately 29 this drastic difference between srnom and ms2 mwcnt surface coverage might be explained by the comparable or higher affinity of srnom to mwcnt in comparison to ms2 and or to higher concentrations of srnom assemblies than ms2 capsids at the tested concentrations fig 4 our experimental findings suggest that nom is expected to have a major effect on ms2 adsorption onto mwcnt even at low nom concentration competitive co adsorption of ms2 and srnom to mwcnt to evaluate competitive co adsorption of nom and ms2 on mwcnt both at low and high nom concentrations we performed batch co adsorption experiments with 5 mg and 15 mg of mwcnt and at different initial srnom concentrations for both mwcnt masses the presence of srnom resulted in significant decreases in ms2 adsorption and hence ms2 lrv even at the lowest srnom concentrations tested fig 5 a srnom presence therefore decreases ms2 access to mwcnt adsorption sites possibly due to the competition for the same adsorption site since srnom adsorption to mwcnt is also driven by hydrophobic effect ateia et al 2017 in addition srnom might adsorb to other adsorption sites and consequently block the access to ms2 to mwcnt adsorption sites at the low initial srnom concentration of 0 4 mgc l the ms2 lrv decreased by 22 from 4 2 to 3 3 lrv and by 80 from 1 8 to 0 4 lrv for batch reactors containing 15 and 5 mg of mwcnt respectively these experimental results show that the initial doc concentration has a major effect on the competitive adsorption of ms2 and srnom onto mwcnt indeed at an initial srnom concentration of 0 4 mgc l in the batch reactors 20 ml the estimated number of srnom assemblies was 108 times higher than the number of capsids 3 107 capsids in 20 ml the finding of competitive co adsorption between ms2 and srnom at such low srnom concentrations is in apparent contrast to the finding in brady est√©vez et al 2010c who showed that ms2 lrv was not affected by srnom at a concentration of 1 mgc l yet as suggested in the introduction this observation could also be due to the a short contact time of the srnom with the filter surfaces during filtration in comparison with our batch experiments resulting in a lower competitive effect at low nom concentrations furthermore our findings are in good agreement with reported competitive co adsorption of ms2 and srha onto self assembled monolayers of alkyl thiols formed from ethanolic solution of cysteamine sam nh3 surface as investigated using qcm d armanious et al 2016b specifically the adsorbed mass of ms2 on the sam nh3 surface decreased from 2300 ng cm2 in the absence of srha to 1400 and 400 ng cm2 when solutions contained srha as co solute at concentrations of 0 25 mgc l and 2 5 mgc l respectively the low srha concentration of 0 25 mgc l therefore decreased ms2 adsorbed masses by 39 relative to the adsorbed mass in the absence of srha this decrease is comparable to the decrease shown in fig 5a in presence of srnom our results thus highlight that the presence of nom as co solute decreases the capability of mwcnt to adsorb viruses irrespective of the initial nom concentration ms2 lrv decreased exponentially with increasing initial srnom concentration until reaching a lrv close to zero for both mwcnt masses at the highest tested srnom concentrations fig 5a ms2 lrv exponential decrease was more pronounced at lower mwcnt masses ms2 lrv decreased to values close to zero for initial srnom concentration at 2 5 mgc l and above when using 5 mg mwcnts whereas similar lrv values were reached only above 10 mgc l srnom when using 15 mg mwcnt fig 5a these results confirmed that the higher the mwcnt surface area the more adsorption sites and therefore the less competition between srnom and ms2 occurred as already suggested by the linear increase of ms2 lrv with increasing mwcnt mass in fig 2 the decrease in competition with increasing mwcnt is also supported by fig 5b in which we replotted the data from fig 5a but normalized ms2 lrv to the mass of mwcnt used this normalization resulted in similar decrease in ms2 lrv for experiments with 5 mg and 15 mg mwcnt the competitive co adsorption effect at a given initial virus concentration and srnom concentration increased as the number of adsorption sites on mwcnt decreased as a result of decreasing mwcnt mass in the application of mwcnt filters designed for water treatment water and thus nom will be continuously delivered to the mwcnt surface furthermore the concentration of nom is expected to be much higher than the concentration of viruses the nom will therefore adsorb to the mwcnt surface until the entire surface is saturated irrespectively of which mwcnt mass is used to prepare a mwcnt filter and the initial nom concentration in the natural water because the srnom adlayer on the mwcnt is negatively charged negatively charged viruses like many enteric viruses would therefore be electrostatically repelled and not retained by the filter electrostatic repulsion of viruses from nom adlayers was already demonstrated by armanious et al 2016b ms2 did not adsorb onto qcm d sensors that were pre coated by srha in order to verify that the srnom adlayer on mwcnt indeed impaired ms2 adsorption and hence lowered ms2 lrv we first preloaded mwcnt with srnom at different initial concentrations 3 h equilibration before adding ms2 to the batch reactors fig 6 as compared to the experiments in which the two co solutes were added simultaneously the pre addition of srnom and hence the pre formation of a srnom adlayer on mwcnt surfaces resulted in pronounced decreases in ms2 lrv at low srnom initial concentrations at an initial srnom concentration of 0 4 mgc l ms2 lrv decreased from 4 2 lrv to 3 3 lrv when ms2 and srnom were simultaneously added to only 1 2 lrv when added sequentially the lrv of ms2 was therefore about 3 times lower than the value that we observed for the batch experiment in which srnom and ms2 were simultaneously added to 15 mg of mwcnt these results confirm that the formation of a negatively charged nom adlayer on the mwcnt surface impaired adsorption of ms2 at higher initial nom concentrations 1 mgc l the ms2 lrv was comparable irrespectively of whether srnom was preloaded to the mwcnt or simultaneously added with ms2 these srnom concentrations therefore were sufficiently high for srnom to outcompete ms2 for adsorption sites on the mwcnt even when the two adsorbates were simultaneously added figs 5a and 6 our results strongly suggest that virus adsorption by mwcnt based filters is impractical from waters that also contain nom to demonstrate that the results obtained with srnom are transferrable to natural waters with different types of nom we subsequently analyzed competitive co adsorption of ms2 and nom in different natural water samples furthermore we assessed the effect of ca2 on ms2 removal effect of water calcium concentration and water source on the competitive co adsorption of ms2 and nom to mwcnt adsorption of ms2 to mwcnt and other negatively charged viruses from natural waters will likely be influenced by factors beyond the concentration of nom as a co solute for example brady est√©vez et al 2010c showed that adding ca2 1 mm cacl2 to a solution containing ms2 and alginate increased by 1 2 the ms2 lrv by a mwcnt filter the authors ascribed this increased removal in the presence of ca2 to the formation of cation bridges between negatively charged groups in the nom adlayer and on the ms2 surface evidence for such cation bridges was provided already in earlier studies jermann et al 2007 pham et al 2009 enhanced virus lrv in presence of dissolved ca2 could imply that mwcnt may be used as a filter material for virus removal for waters that contain high ca2 concentrations or if ca2 is added to waters prior to the filtration step to assess whether ca2 alleviates competition by allowing ms2 to adsorb to nom adlayer we performed batch experiments with a fixed srnom concentration i e 4 8 mgc l and three different cacl2 concentrations i e 0 1 mmol l 1 9 mmol l and 7 5 mmol l lrv of ms2 increased with increasing ca2 concentration fig 7 a specifically at a concentration of 0 1 mmolca2 l ms2 lrv was equal to 0 4 0 3 but it increased to 3 3 0 3 and 4 5 0 3 at 1 9 mmol l and 7 5 mmol l respectively fig 7a yellow squares this finding implies that ca2 enhanced ms2 adsorption onto srnom adlayer likely by forming cationic bridges based on previous observation jermann et al 2007 pham et al 2009 however direct evidence confirming cationic bridges between nom adlayer and ms2 at the surface of the mwcnt remains missing given that ca2 alleviated competitive co adsorption of srnom and ms2 we also conducted additional ms2 removal experiments with natural waters containing different types of nom and a different ionic matrix than the dilution buffer used for the co solutes batch experiments to compare them to the previous batch experiments tap ground and river water as well as wastewater treatment plant secondary effluent were sampled twice december 2018 and january 2019 to obtain samples that contain a range of nom types and sources as well as ca2 concentration the water sources ranged in ca2 concentrations from 1 6 to 2 6 mmolca2 l and in doc concentrations between 0 91 and 9 77 mgc l we characterized differences in size and chemical functions of the nom in the different samples by lc ocd ond fig 8 specifically the percentage of the dissolved organic carbon that was present as biopolymers humics building blocks lmw organics and neutrals ranged from 0 2 to 24 37 9 to 78 6 7 to 20 4 0 5 to 5 4 and 13 6 to 19 5 respectively fig 8 for doc initial concentrations between 0 91 and 3 53 mgc l ms2 lrv varied between 2 7 and 3 3 which was higher than ms2 lrv observed for srnom co solute batch experiments at similar initial doc concentrations conducted without ca 2 fig 7b red circles interestingly these lrv values were comparable for the different natural nom samples irrespectively the initial doc concentration in the range 0 91 3 53 mgc l or the chemical composition in nom fig 8 contrary to what was measured for srnom co solute experiment without ca2 the difference in lrv value and trend observed between the batch experiments conducted in natural waters in the doc range of 0 91 and 3 53 and the srnom co solute experiments conducted without ca2 may be due to the presence of divalent and trivalent cations in natural waters that might mitigate the competitive co adsorption of ms2 and nom on mwcnt like ca2 that was present at similar concentrations in all natural water samples indeed the ms2 lrv measured for natural waters having an initial doc concentration between 0 91 and 3 53 mgc l was in a similar range than the ms2 lrv measured for the batch experiment performed with an initial srnom concentration of 4 8 mgc l and a ca2 concentration of 1 9 mmolca2 l overall the natural nom samples similar to srnom lowered ms2 lrv in comparison with single solute experiment with ms2 and mwcnt indicative of competitive co adsorption at low initial doc concentrations the competition was likely alleviated by the presence of divalent or trivalent cations especially ca2 as described above fig 7 however for initial doc concentrations higher than 3 53 mgc l ms2 lrv also decreased as initial nom concentration increased in the nom samples until reaching values close to zero for the batch experiments performed with secondary effluent irrespective ca2 concentration the findings highlight that competitive co adsorption is independent of natural water types and that the competition increased with increasing nom virus ratios and decreasing ca2 concentrations figs 7 and 8 we therefore conclude that while mwcnt may be a promising material for adsorption of virus in the absence of nom its application to virus removal in natural waters is expected to not be suitable due to the presence of nom which undergoes competitive co adsorption with the viruses competitive suppression of virus removal by nom is expected to occur for nom that vary broadly in chemical composition and also in waters that show varying ca2 concentrations 4 conclusion this study provides evidence for competitive co adsorption of ms2 and nom thereby highlighting that the occurrence of nom as a co solute in natural waters questions the suitability of mwcnt as a virus adsorbent to produce filters for pou systems despite the fact that mwcnt show outstanding adsorption properties in controlled systems we show that the presence of nom even at low doc concentration and in presence of ca2 competitively suppresses virus adsorption adsorption of srnom onto mwcnt impairs ms2 adsorption due to the formation of a negatively charged srnom adlayer on the mwcnt surface resulting in electrostatic repulsion of the net negatively charged ms2 from the adlayer this effect occurs irrespective of which mwcnt mass is used and irrespective of the initial nom concentration indeed batch experiments with ms2 and srnom as co solutes showed that ms2 lrv decreased exponentially with increasing srnom concentration down to very low lrv values at the highest tested srnom concentrations batch adsorption experiments with dissolved ca2 and natural water samples showed that nom of different sources and with varying chemical compositions competed with ms2 for adsorption onto the mwcnt although dissolved ca2 presence might punctually alleviated the nom competitive effect we expect that for most natural waters where virus nom ratio is low mwcnt should not be considered

19979,a leading challenge in drinking water treatment is to remove small sized viruses from the water in a simple and efficient manner multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnt are new generation adsorbents with previously demonstrated potential as filter media to improve virus removal this study therefore aimed to evaluate the field applicability of mwcnt filters for virus removal in water containing natural organic matter nom as co solute to viruses using batch equilibrium experiments contrary to previous studies our results showed with ms2 bacteriophages single solute systems that the affinity of mwcnt for ms2 was low since after 3 h of equilibration only 4 log10 reduction value lrv of ms2 20 ml at an initial concentration of 106 pfu ms2 ml were reached single solute experiments with suwannee river nom srnom performed with environmentally relevant concentrations showed mwcnt surface saturation at initial srnom concentrations between 10 and 15 mgc l for water ph between 5 2 and 8 7 these results suggested that at nom virus ratios found in natural waters the nom would competitively suppress virus adsorption onto mwcnt even at low nom concentrations we confirmed this expectation with srnom ms2 co solute experiments which showed an exponential decrease of the ms2 lrv by mwcnt with an increase in the initial srnom concentration more interestingly we showed that pre equilibrating mwcnt with a srnom solution at a concentration as low as 0 4 mgc l resulted in a lrv decrease of 3 for ms2 due to the formation of a negatively charged srnom adlayer on the mwcnt surface complementary batch experiments with natural nom containing waters and competition experiments with srnom in the presence of cacl2 confirmed that the presence of nom in waters challenges virus removal by mwcnt filters irrespective of the concentration and type of nom and also in the presence of ca2 we therefore conclude that mwcnt filters produced with commercially available pristine mwcnt cannot be considered as a viable technology for drinking water virus removal graphical abstract image 1 keywords multiwalled carbon nanotubes virus treatment natural organic matter competitive adsorption drinking water 1 introduction viruses are responsible for a large share of the global burden of respiratory and diarrheal infectious diseases kotloff et al 2012 and can be responsible for major outbreaks one major challenge to reduce mortality from waterborne viruses is the efficient removal of viruses in drinking water in low and middle income countries a promising strategy to prevent virus waterborne diseases are point of use pou treatments deployed in households and within communities in these decentralized water facilities water treatment technologies selected have low costs and maintenance but are sustainable and easy to use peter varbanets et al 2009 however many conventional water treatment processes implemented in the context of pou may have minimal impact on virus removal or inactivation for example microfiltration and ultrafiltration is largely ineffective in removing viruses due to their small size tanneru et al 2013 to meet the local operation requirements and an adequate virus removal new processes urgently need to be developed rahaman et al 2012 carbon nanotubes cnt are broadly considered promising materials for future water treatment applications including filtration and or adsorption the unique features of cnt include high surface areas hydrophobicity porosity rapid adsorption kinetics simple regeneration techniques and good mechanical and thermal stability as a result cnt are promising alternatives to traditional adsorbents elsehly et al 2018 sarkar et al 2018 shimizu et al 2018 since the invention of cnt scientists have shown that these materials have antimicrobial properties can be used for removal of heavy metals and organic pollutants by complexation and adsorption respectively sun et al 2012 smith and rodrigues 2015 studies have further suggested that cnt are also capable to remove viruses brady est√©vez et al 2010b demonstrated that a filter composed of a mixture of single walled carbon nanotubes swcnt and multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnt reached a virus log10 removal value lrv of 6 for ms2 prd1 and t4 bacteriophages at a flux through the filter of 160 l m2 h in another study ms2 removal by a mwcnt filter was between 5 and 8 lrv at low pressure and lrv was higher than what was achieved using a swcnt filter brady est√©vez et al 2010a 2010c the higher removal observed for mwcnt filters was ascribed to physical retention of ms2 by the entangled cnt network that was deposited onto the filter in combination with ms2 adsorption onto mwcnt numerous virus sorbent interaction forces are expected to drive ms2 adsorption onto mwcnt given that mwcnt are largely apolar hydrophobic they tend to form aggregates and bundles with apolar internal cavities to the surface of which ms2 may adsorb by the hydrophobic effect chandler 2005 armanious et al 2016a in addition van der waals vdw forces which operate at short virus surface separation distances contribute to ms2 mwcnt interactions overall the past work supports the potential of mwcnt filters to complement existing water purification technologies that are already used in low and middle income countries for households or water kiosks drinking water treatment under field conditions however natural water sources contain particles in suspension and colloids 45 Œºm that can affect the efficiency of the mwcnt filters by clogging the filter applying a first pre filtration step like gravity driven membrane gdm filtration would eliminate the potential interference from suspended particles pronk et al 2019 however this pre filtration step is not removing natural organic matter nom which is smaller than virions nom is ubiquitous in water and has also a high affinity to mwcnt surfaces hyung and kim 2008 ateia et al 2017 shimizu et al 2018 the high affinity of nom for mwcnt might be a drawback for virus removal by mwcnt filters as observed brady est√©vez et al 2010c using a mwcnt filter the authors observed that ms2 lrv by mwcnt filter decreased from 5 6 to 0 17 1 in presence of srnom or alginate at concentrations higher than 1 mg l the authors hypothesized that nom likely competed with the virus for adsorption sites in the mwcnt surface it is likely that the decrease in ms2 lrv in the presence of nom was due to the formation of a negatively charged nom adlayer that electrostatically repelled ms2 from the surface given that ms2 is negatively charged at circumneutral ph i e isoelectric point of the virus iep 3 9 armanious et al 2016b used quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation qcm d monitoring to directly demonstrate electrostatic repulsion of ms2 from nom adlayers that formed on a positively charged surface self assembled monolayers of alkyl thiols formed from ethanolic solution of cysteamine sam nh3 at ph iep of ms2 nonetheless brady est√©vez et al 2010c reported that nom supposedly had a negligible negative effect on virus removal by mwcnt filter when treating water samples with nom concentrations below 1 mg l the authors concluded that mwcnt filter technology was a cost effective technology for point of use virus removal in low nom waters the study therefore assumed that there is a threshold concentration of nom below which virus removal by mwcnt filters remains unaffected however the threshold observed in this study could also be explained by a short contact time of the nom with the filter surfaces during filtration resulting in a limited co adsorption effect at low nom concentrations indeed armanious et al 2014 showed using qcm d adsorption studies that continuously supplying nom even at very low concentrations to positively charged adsorbent surface resulted in nom adsorption until the entire adsorbent surface was saturated armanious et al 2014 questions the notion of a critical nom threshold concentration in solution below which virus removal from the same solution is not affected as suggested by brady est√©vez et al 2010c another important aspect in assessing the applicability of mwcnt filters as an efficient and innovative solution for point of use virus removal is to study potential effects of the ionic composition of the solution on ms2 removal and nom competition brady est√©vez et al 2010c and brady est√©vez et al 2008 showed that increasing the ionic strength is by adding nacl increased ms2 removal by cnt filters due to the suppression of repulsive electrostatic forces between viruses and cnt other studies showed that divalent and trivalent cations could increase the adsorption of ms2 to surfaces pumpens 2020 reported that ms2 was found to adsorb on anionic clay like nanocomposites together with zn2 mg2 and al3 higher adsorption of ms2 to sandy loam soil in presence of oxidized metal ions like ferric oxihydroxides was noted by witzany 2010 farrah 1982 showed that the presence of magnesium increased ms2 adsorption to membrane filters while brady est√©vez et al 2010c showed that it decreased the virus removal by mwct filters finally brady est√©vez et al 2010c showed that adding cacl2 improved ms2 virus removal by mwcnt filters in presence of nom nom competitive effect mitigation during virus removal by mwcnt filters in presence of ca2 may result from ca2 forming cationic bridges between negatively charged carboxylate and phenolate groups in the nom adlayer and the negatively charged amino acids on the ms2 virion surface the cation bridges formation would increase ms2 adsorption through the formation of nom ca2 ms2 complexes as compared to ca2 free solutions thereby overcoming direct ms2 nom electrostatic repulsion kalinichev et al 2011 kloster et al 2013 evidence in support of cation bridges was also reported by pham et al 2009 who showed higher attachment efficiency of ms2 onto the srnom adlayers in presence of ca2 amongst all ions present in natural waters the competition mitigation effect observed in presence of ca2 is of major interest since it might allow using mwcnt filters to remove viruses from natural waters containing high calcium concentrations however there is a research gap concerning the adsorption mechanisms of ms2 onto mwcnt and the effect of nom as co solute and the presence of ca2 to critically evaluate the field application of mwcnt filters for virus removal the goal of our work was to experimentally assess the competitive co adsorption between ms2 bacteriophages and nom to mwcnt this information is critical to inform the feasibility of using mwcnt as adsorbent to produce filters to remove virus from waters that contain different types and concentrations of nom and or ionic compositions to do so we studied adsorption of ms2 bacteriophages to mwcnt in batch reactors both in the absence and presence of nom as co adsorbate ms2 bacteriophages were used as a surrogate for apolar and negatively charged enteric viruses of human health concern such as adenovirus shi et al 2016 furthermore ms2 bacteriophage is a virus surrogate recommended by the world health organization who to evaluate virus removal of household water treatment options world health organization 2011 and it was used in previous studies investigating the virus removal by cnt filters allowing for better comparability between studies brady est√©vez et al 2010b 2010c briefly batch experiments with ms2 were performed to estimate the minimum mass of mwcnt required to reach at least an ms2 lrv of 4 in line with the recommendation of the u s environmental protection agency us epa 2015 subsequently we performed single solute batch adsorption experiments with ms2 and srnom to evaluate at which concentrations these two solutes saturated the mwcnt surface this information is critical to assess competitive effects in co solute systems then we assessed competitive co adsorption to mwcnt in batch adsorption experiments containing both ms2 and srnom at different concentration ratios finally for a more environmentally realistic assessment of the potential of mwcnt filters for virus removal we used natural waters in batch experiments and determined the effect of ca2 on ms2 removal in srnom ca2 batch experiments the results from this work inform on the efficacy of mwcnt to produce virus filters a necessary first step toward application in the field for drinking water treatment 2 material and methods multiwalled carbon nanotubes mwcnt were purchased from cheaptubes lot number 180320 usa the mwcnt had a specific surface area of 117 m2 g their length and outer diameter were equal to 10 30 Œº m and 20 30 nm respectively metallic impurities in mwcnt were determined by icp ms after digestion of the mwcnt for 2 h in hno3 65 and h2o2 details about metal impurities are provided in the supplementary information table s1 prior to use mwcnt in batch adsorption experiments mwcnt were bath sonicated in ethanol i e 100 mg mwcnt in 20 ml ethanol 35 hz 120 w 5min the resulting suspension was subsequently vacuum filtered onto 0 1 Œº

were then collected and dried overnight at 60 c before use nom and calcium solution preparation and collection of natural water samples suwannee river natural organic matter srnom 2r101n ro isolation

and 0 58 g l nacl is 26 mm ph 4 75 which was used as a dilution buffer for all batch experiments and stirred overnight to ensure complete dissolution of srnom the ph of the srnom stock solution was then adjusted to the targeted ph required i e ph 5 2 7 7 and 8 7 by adding small volumes of 5 m naoh the dissolved organic carbon doc of the resulting srnom solutions was quantified using a toc l total carbon analyzer shimadzu japan calcium stock solutions were prepared dissolving cacl2 in buffer solution to obtain three different ca2 concentrations 0 1 mmol l 1 9 mmol l and 7 5 mmol l respectively to demonstrate the transferability of the results obtained with the model nom to nom in natural water samples we also determined ms2 adsorption to mwcnt in water samples that we collected from four different sources tap water ground water river water and wastewater treatment plant secondary effluent we collected these water samples at eawag d√ºbendorf switzerland more specifically river and ground water were collected from the sampling stations of chriesbach river and the local aquifer respectively the secondary effluent was sampled from eawag s pilot scale wastewater treatment plant outlet after collection the samples were filtered through sterile 0 45 Œº m pes filters sartorius germany to remove particulates before using the water samples in batch adsorption experiments doc and ca2 concentrations of these waters were quantified by toc l total carbon analyzer shimadzu japan and ion chromatography metrohm 930 compact ic flex respectively batch experiments adsorption of ms2 and nom onto mwcnt was studied both in single solute and co solute batch reactor setups and performed in duplicate all batch reactor experiments were set up by weighing a known mass of mwcnt in 50 ml carbon free glass vials muffled at 450 c for 4 h followed by adding the targeted solution 20 ml as shown in table 1 ph values and doc ca2 concentrations used in our study are based on a literature review we have made from 85 studies that reported water chemistry characteristics of natural water samples from 42 countries the data from the literature review were used to calculate average upper and lower values 5th and 95th percentiles thereby capturing the range of values found in natural waters that can be used as a drinking water source the references of these studies are available in supplementary information section 4 based on the results of adsorption kinetic experiments fig s1 and fig s2 in supplementary information the batch equilibration time was set to 3 h after 3 h mixing at 40 rpm with a rotating mixer at room temperature the samples were filtered through sterile 0 45 Œº m pes filters syringe sartorius germany and the filtrate was further analyzed for batch experiments aiming to study virus removal by mwcnt with and without nom co solutes a blank reactor with ms2 solution was included to determine ms2 concentrations after 3 h mixing this blank was used to determine the concentration of virus available for adsorption onto mwcnt ci and thus accounted for any potential dilution variability decay and adsorption to the glass vial during the batch experiment decreases in the blanks were between 9 and 66 5 or between 9 104 and 7 105 pfu ml depending on the experiment a reactor with 15 mg mwcnt in buffer solution was also ran as a blank for single solute srnom adsorption experiments in order to quantify the amount of doc that leached from the mwcnt this doc value docb was then subtracted from the doc value measured after the single solute batch experiment with srnom and mwcnt docf in order to estimate the srnom adsorbed mass per mass of mwcnt as described in equation 1 1 q e s r n o m d o c i d o c f d o c b v m m w c n t where

bacteriophages were used as a surrogate for enteric viruses of human health concern ms2 dsmz 13767 and its associated e coli host dsmz 5695 were purchased from dsmz german collection of microorganisms and cell cultures braunsch weig germany ms2 stock solution was prepared at the beginning of the study by amplifying ms2 commercial stock solution in 1 l of e coli culture after the amplification step the culture was filtered over a 0 22 Œºm pes vacuum filter membrane to remove e coli cells cell removal prevents any proliferation of ms2 during the batch adsorption experiments following filtration we additionally purified the virus stock solution using centrifugal membrane filters amicon ultra 15 merk millipore germany before using the ms2 solution in experiments it was previously shown that the additional centrifugal membrane filtration step is critical to remove lower molecular weight organics that may heavily interfere with ms2 adsorption to sorbent surfaces armanious et al 2016a the double agar layer assay was used to enumerate infectious bacteriophages pfu ml us epa method 1602 2001 pitol et al 2017 briefly 100 Œº l of sample containing ms2 were mixed with 200 Œº l of e coli host in soft agar 0 7 agar and poured onto a hard agar plate 1 5 agar after overnight incubation at 37 c plaques formed from the bacteriophages were counted ms2 lrv was calculated as follows 2 l r v l

adsorption batch experiment in the presence of mwcnt to evaluate mwcnt ms2 adsorption capacity and compare it to the srnom adsorption capacity the adsorbed mass of ms2 per mass of mwcnt qe total virions mg mg was calculated considering that the total number of ms2 capsids in solution is higher than the total number of pfu given that not all virions are infective fig 1 armanious et al 2016a the ratios between the different ms2 subpopulations i e rinfectious virions rna virions 0 04 and rrna virions total virions 0 93 combined with the pfu ml concentration measured with the double layer assay were used to calculate the number of rna virions and rna free virions referring to individual virions with and without rna in the assembled capsid respectively these values were taken from the table provided in supporting information of armanious et al 2016a even if these values might be different from one study to another due to different propagation and purification protocols we used armanious et al 2016a ratios as approximation for our work indeed the mwcnt surface loading by ms2 would not be fundamentally impacted if the ratios are different briefly the number of infectious virions adsorbed onto mwcnt during batch experiment ninfectious virions was calculated using equation 3 3 n i n f e c t i o u s v i r i o n s r i n f e c t i o u s v i r i o n s p l a q u e f o r m i

with organic carbon and organic nitrogen detectors lc ocd ond analysis the nom in the different water samples used for the co adsorption batch experiments were characterized by size using lc ocd ond this method allows to separate nom molecules into major fractions of different sizes and chemical functions and to quantify them on the basis of organic carbon concentration to do so each sample was passed through a size exclusion chromatographic column from tosoh toyopearl tsk hw 50s 250 20 mm with a separation range of 20 kda 100da phosphate buffer 24 mm ph 6 6 was used as eluent and the flow rate was set at 1 ml min after the chromatographic column the flow was split into a gr√§ntzel thin film reactor c compounds oxidation and a special donox reactor n compounds oxidation not further described herein as it was not used the upper part of the gr√§ntzel thin film reactor was shielded from the uv bulb to allow stripping of the co2 present in water after mixing the sample with phosphoric acid 60 mm ph 1 2 then the sample was exposed to uv light in the lower part of the gr√§ntzel thin film reactor to produce hydroxyl radical oh c compounds were fully oxidized by hydroxyl radicals to co2 which was subsequently analyzed with a siemens ir detector more detailed information on lc ocd ond is available in huber et al 2011 the obtained chromatograms are divided in five

described in huber et al 2011 3 results and discussion evaluation of the minimum mwcnt mass to comply with epa standards for virus removal to estimate the minimum mass of mwcnt required to reach a 4 lrv and thus comply with the epa standards for virus removal us epa 2015 and to understand the ph effect on ms2 adsorption onto mwcnt we determined ms2 lrv as a function of increasing mwcnt mass at three experimental ph of 5 2 7 7 and 8 7 fig 2 as depicted in fig 2 ms2 lrv was linearly correlated to the mass of mwcnt used in the batch experiments confirming that mwcnt present ms2 adsorption sites a multiple linear regression was calculated to evaluate both effects of mwcnt mass and ph on ms2 lrv description of the model in section 3 of supplementary information a significant regression equation was found f 3 64 473 1 p 2 2 10 16 with a r2 of 0 955 ms2 lrv was significantly influenced by mwcnt mass beta 0 29 p 2 10 16 but neither ph 7 7 beta 0 04 p 0 6 nor ph 8 7 beta 0 04 p 0 6 were statistically significant relative to ph 5 2 this finding strongly suggests that the higher the mwcnt mass the higher the ms2 lrv as visible in fig 2 while ph did not significantly affect ms2 adsorption to mwcnt over the tested ph from 5 2 to 8 7 the effect of ph on adsorption mechanisms is observed if a significant change in the net surface charge occurs over the ph range tested in our study the negligible effect of ph on ms2 removal by mwcnt is due to the fact that both ms2 and mwcnt surfaces charge were not changed and were mainly negative over the tested ph range specifically most ms2 capsid amino acids have a pka lower than 4 5 aspartic acid glutamic acid or higher than 10 lysine armanious et al 2016a and mwcnt are negatively charged at ph higher than 2 4 5 due to the presence of acidic groups such as carboxylic acid moieties pka 4 5 lu and su 2007 michen and graule 2010 wang et al 2011 singh et al 2012 skwarek et al 2016 nonetheless electrostatic repulsion is not a major limitation to ms2 mwcnt adsorption mechanisms because acidic groups have a low surface density on mwcnt yudianti et al 2011 sun et al 2014 and they are mainly located at mwcnt tips mcclory et al 2010 krishnakumar et al 2012 furthermore other interaction forces such as œÄ œÄ interactions hydrogen bounding and hydrophobic effect can overcome electrostatic repulsion armanious et al 2016a demonstrated through qcm d experiments the hydrophobic effect role in the adsorption of ms2 on surfaces based on past studies and our batch experiments results we therefore hypothetize that ms2 primarily adsorbed through hydrophobic effect to the apolar patches present at the mwcnt surface with ms2 having a positive hydrophathy index chandler 2005 armanious et al 2016a given that the multiple linear regression showed that ph had no significant effect on ms2 lrv a single linear regression was calculated from all data points from the batch experiments conducted at ph 5 2 7 7 and 8 7 to predict the ms2 lrv based on mwcnt mass fig 2 a significant regression equation was found f 1 16 631 1 p 2 8 10 14 with a r2 of 0 974 ms2 lrv predicted is equal to 0 14 0 28 mwcnt mass when mwcnt mass is measured in milligrams at an initial ms2 concentration of 106 pfu ml ms2 lrv increased by 0 28 for each mg of mwcnt over the ph range tested fig 2 shows that a minimum mass of 15 mg mwcnt was required to reach the 4 lrv of ms2 as imposed by epa regulations us epa 2015 notably because ms2 lrv was linearly correlated with mwcnt mass in the ph range tested higher levels of virus lrv are expected by increasing mass of mwcnt these results are in accordance with other studies that showed higher virus removal efficiency with increasing cnt mass onto filters brady est√©vez et al 2010b park and hwang 2014 we note that brady est√©vez et al 2010c used a lower amount of mwcnt of 3 mg per filter at a water chemistry 10 mm nacl and ph 5 5 that was similar to what we used here but obtained 5 38 0 80 lrv for ms2 this higher removal in that study as compared to our values likely resulted from the use of a different mwcnt material in brady est√©vez et al 2010c nanotechlabs inc 17 9 nm diameter 91 21 Œº m length mwcnt properties vary between suppliers and even batches poulsen et al 2015 2016 glomstad et al 2016 showed that cnt adsorption capacity of phenanthrene was distinct between two types of mwcnt while brady est√©vez et al 2010c reported a higher ms2 removal with a mwcnt filter than with a swcnt filter another factor that can explain the difference between our results and those of brady est√©vez et al 2010c is that the filtration experiments conducted by brady est√©vez et al 2010c combined ms2 physical retention by the entangled mwcnt layer with adsorption on mwcnt while we only assessed ms2 adsorption to mwcnt in our experimental setup however in regards to the drastic ms2 lrv decrease observed by brady est√©vez et al 2010c during the filtration of virus in co solute systems it can be hypothesized that adsorption was the main pathway by which virus was removed from water by mwcnt filters ms2 adsorption onto mwcnt is expected to be largely driven by the hydrophobic effect as mentioned above concentration dependent adsorption of ms2 by mwcnt the effect of initial ms2 concentration on ms2 adsorption by mwcnt was studied to evaluate if mwcnt saturation by ms2 could be reached at a mass of 15 mg mwcnt information on the maximum adsorbed mass or number of ms2 capsids per mass of mwcnt would allow estimating the volume of virus free filtered water that can be obtained from one mwcnt filter assuming a human virus concentration of 103 pfu l or 101 103 gene copy l in river water and that these viruses adsorb similarly to ms2 haramoto et al 2010 hamza et al 2011 goh et al 2019 the adsorbed mass of ms2 per mass of mwcnt was therefore plotted as a function of ms2 initial concentration as shown in fig 3 a single linear regression was calculated to predict the adsorbed mass of ms2 per mass of mwcnt based on the initial ms2 concentration fig 3 a significant regression equation was found f 1 3 2 5 104 p 5 6 10 7 with a r2 of 0 999 the adsorbed mass of ms2 per mass of mwcnt predicted is equal to 2 1 10 4 1 6 10 10 ms2 initial concentration when ms2 initial concentration is measured in pfu ml the adsorbed mass of ms2 per mass of mwcnt increased by 1 6 10 10 mg g per pfu ml of ms2 at the maximum initial ms2 concentration tested i e 109 pfu ml the adsorbed mass of ms2 per mass of mwcnt was 0 16 0 002 mg g corresponding to a total capsid number of 4 1011 4 109 adsorbed per 15 mg corresponding to a mwcnt surface area of 1 75 104 cm2 based on the ms2 capsid diameter of approximately 28 8 nm we estimated that at an initial ms2 concentration of 109 pfu ml the total number of virions adsorbed to the mwcnt covered a surface of 2 6 cm2 corresponding to only 0 015 of the mwcnt total surface this is approximately 2000 times lower than the hypothetical maximum surface coverage i e 24 40 of surface covered by ms2 if one assumes random sequential adsorption of individual ms2 virions up to the surface jamming limit following armanious et al 2016a we note that in the same study adsorption of ms2 leveled off at a concentration of approximately 1800 ng cm2 while in our study the highest adsorbed ms2 concentration was only 0 13 ng cm2 at a ms2 concentration of 109 pfu ml the differences in the adsorbed mass solely reflect the different experimental set ups for adsorption in both studies in armanious et al 2016a ms2 was continuously delivered at a constant virus inflow concentration over a qcm d sensor until the jamming limit of ms2 on the sensor surface was reached in our study the initial ms2 concentration was significantly smaller than the concentration that would have been needed to reach the jamming limit i e 1012 pfu ml calculated from armanious et al 2016a maximum surface coverage and mwcnt surface area available for adsorption furthermore reduction in surface area available for ms2 adsorption due to mwcnt aggregation and or bundle formation was not accounted for in our calculation it is therefore difficult to predict the maximum amount or mass of virus that can be adsorbed per mass of mwcnt but fig 3 shows that even with an initial concentration of 109 pfu ml the jamming limit of mwcnt surface was not reached concentration dependent adsorption of srnom to mwcnt natural waters containing viruses also contain nom as a co solute that may interfere with virus removal by mwcnt filters as already observed by brady est√©vez et al 2010c it is therefore critical to assess the effect of initial nom concentration on nom adsorption onto mwcnt to evaluate the potential nom competitive co adsorption effect with viruses to do so we conducted single solute nom adsorption experiments onto mwcnt at varying initial nom concentrations the resulting adsorbed amounts of nom per mass of mwcnt are plotted as a function of the initial doc concentration in fig 4 fig 4 shows that for low initial doc concentrations the adsorbed mass of srnom per mass of mwcnt increased as the initial doc concentration increased for higher initial doc concentrations contrary to what was observed with ms2 fig 3 the adsorbed mass of srnom per mass of mwcnt attained a threshold suggesting that surface saturation of mwcnt was reached the maximum adsorbed mass of srnom per mass of mwcnt was 20 7 1 22 mgc g and 22 6 0 37 i e an adsorbed mass per surface of mwcnt equals to 17 7 ngc cm2 and 19 3 ngc cm2 respectively at ph 7 7 and 8 7 respectively these values are in agreement with jeong et al 2017 who reported a saturation concentration around 20 mgc g after batch experiments with mwcnt and srnom œÄ œÄ interactions electrostatic interactions hydrogen bonding and the hydrophobic effect are the main driving forces srnom mwcnt interactions ateia et al 2017 in contrast to ms2 the adsorption of srnom to mwcnt was ph dependent the maximum adsorbed mass of srnom per mass of mwcnt at ph 5 2 was 29 9 0 5 mgc g and higher than the value measured at ph 7 7 and 8 7 the higher adsorption of srnom to mwcnt at the lower tested ph likely resulted from srnom being less negatively charged at this ph and thus possibly adopting a more compact conformation and consequently denser packing on the mwcnt surface as compared to the higher ph adoption of a more compact conformation of ha assemblies in solution at lower ph was previously demonstrated for suwannee river humic acid srha by photon correlation spectroscopy pcs i e the hydrodynamic diameter of the assemblies decreased from approximately 60 nm 10 nm when decreasing the ph from 7 5 to 4 5 at constant is 10 mm baalousha et al 2006 the more compact conformation and denser packing can be explained by weaker intra and inter molecular electrostatic repulsion in and between srnom assemblies on the sorbent surface as previously reported in armanious et al 2014 and de melo et al 2016 higher adsorption of nom to cnt at lower ph was also observed by engel and chefetz 2016 who reported that the saturation value of dissolved organic matter from composted biosolids on swcnt was approximately 1 8 times higher at ph 4 than at ph 7 and ph 10 to calculate the surface coverage of mwcnt by srnom we assumed that the representative formula of a nom assembly is c9h9no6 i e 1 79 10 19 mgc that assemblies can be modeled as rigid spheres having a diameter of 1 nm armanious et al 2016b and that all mwcnt surface area is available for adsorption at ph 7 7 we therefore calculated that 78 of the mwcnt surface was covered by srnom when the maximum adsorbed mass of srnom per mass of mwcnt was reached i e 20 7 1 22 mgc g fig 4 yet mwcnt tend to form bundles and aggregates 78 of surface coverage might correspond to a saturation of all mwcnt adsorption sites available the mwcnt surface coverage value obtained for srnom is 5 106 times higher than the surface coverage of ms2 on mwcnt that we calculated for the experiment conducted at the highest tested initial ms2 concentration i e 109 pfu ml even for initial doc concentrations where mwcnt surface saturation by srnom was not reached mwcnt surface coverage by srnom was significantly higher than the surface coverage observed for ms2 irrespectively the initial ms2 concentration indeed at low srnom concentration i e 2 5 mgc l the calculated mwcnt surface coverage by adsorbed srnom was approximately 29 this drastic difference between srnom and ms2 mwcnt surface coverage might be explained by the comparable or higher affinity of srnom to mwcnt in comparison to ms2 and or to higher concentrations of srnom assemblies than ms2 capsids at the tested concentrations fig 4 our experimental findings suggest that nom is expected to have a major effect on ms2 adsorption onto mwcnt even at low nom concentration competitive co adsorption of ms2 and srnom to mwcnt to evaluate competitive co adsorption of nom and ms2 on mwcnt both at low and high nom concentrations we performed batch co adsorption experiments with 5 mg and 15 mg of mwcnt and at different initial srnom concentrations for both mwcnt masses the presence of srnom resulted in significant decreases in ms2 adsorption and hence ms2 lrv even at the lowest srnom concentrations tested fig 5 a srnom presence therefore decreases ms2 access to mwcnt adsorption sites possibly due to the competition for the same adsorption site since srnom adsorption to mwcnt is also driven by hydrophobic effect ateia et al 2017 in addition srnom might adsorb to other adsorption sites and consequently block the access to ms2 to mwcnt adsorption sites at the low initial srnom concentration of 0 4 mgc l the ms2 lrv decreased by 22 from 4 2 to 3 3 lrv and by 80 from 1 8 to 0 4 lrv for batch reactors containing 15 and 5 mg of mwcnt respectively these experimental results show that the initial doc concentration has a major effect on the competitive adsorption of ms2 and srnom onto mwcnt indeed at an initial srnom concentration of 0 4 mgc l in the batch reactors 20 ml the estimated number of srnom assemblies was 108 times higher than the number of capsids 3 107 capsids in 20 ml the finding of competitive co adsorption between ms2 and srnom at such low srnom concentrations is in apparent contrast to the finding in brady est√©vez et al 2010c who showed that ms2 lrv was not affected by srnom at a concentration of 1 mgc l yet as suggested in the introduction this observation could also be due to the a short contact time of the srnom with the filter surfaces during filtration in comparison with our batch experiments resulting in a lower competitive effect at low nom concentrations furthermore our findings are in good agreement with reported competitive co adsorption of ms2 and srha onto self assembled monolayers of alkyl thiols formed from ethanolic solution of cysteamine sam nh3 surface as investigated using qcm d armanious et al 2016b specifically the adsorbed mass of ms2 on the sam nh3 surface decreased from 2300 ng cm2 in the absence of srha to 1400 and 400 ng cm2 when solutions contained srha as co solute at concentrations of 0 25 mgc l and 2 5 mgc l respectively the low srha concentration of 0 25 mgc l therefore decreased ms2 adsorbed masses by 39 relative to the adsorbed mass in the absence of srha this decrease is comparable to the decrease shown in fig 5a in presence of srnom our results thus highlight that the presence of nom as co solute decreases the capability of mwcnt to adsorb viruses irrespective of the initial nom concentration ms2 lrv decreased exponentially with increasing initial srnom concentration until reaching a lrv close to zero for both mwcnt masses at the highest tested srnom concentrations fig 5a ms2 lrv exponential decrease was more pronounced at lower mwcnt masses ms2 lrv decreased to values close to zero for initial srnom concentration at 2 5 mgc l and above when using 5 mg mwcnts whereas similar lrv values were reached only above 10 mgc l srnom when using 15 mg mwcnt fig 5a these results confirmed that the higher the mwcnt surface area the more adsorption sites and therefore the less competition between srnom and ms2 occurred as already suggested by the linear increase of ms2 lrv with increasing mwcnt mass in fig 2 the decrease in competition with increasing mwcnt is also supported by fig 5b in which we replotted the data from fig 5a but normalized ms2 lrv to the mass of mwcnt used this normalization resulted in similar decrease in ms2 lrv for experiments with 5 mg and 15 mg mwcnt the competitive co adsorption effect at a given initial virus concentration and srnom concentration increased as the number of adsorption sites on mwcnt decreased as a result of decreasing mwcnt mass in the application of mwcnt filters designed for water treatment water and thus nom will be continuously delivered to the mwcnt surface furthermore the concentration of nom is expected to be much higher than the concentration of viruses the nom will therefore adsorb to the mwcnt surface until the entire surface is saturated irrespectively of which mwcnt mass is used to prepare a mwcnt filter and the initial nom concentration in the natural water because the srnom adlayer on the mwcnt is negatively charged negatively charged viruses like many enteric viruses would therefore be electrostatically repelled and not retained by the filter electrostatic repulsion of viruses from nom adlayers was already demonstrated by armanious et al 2016b ms2 did not adsorb onto qcm d sensors that were pre coated by srha in order to verify that the srnom adlayer on mwcnt indeed impaired ms2 adsorption and hence lowered ms2 lrv we first preloaded mwcnt with srnom at different initial concentrations 3 h equilibration before adding ms2 to the batch reactors fig 6 as compared to the experiments in which the two co solutes were added simultaneously the pre addition of srnom and hence the pre formation of a srnom adlayer on mwcnt surfaces resulted in pronounced decreases in ms2 lrv at low srnom initial concentrations at an initial srnom concentration of 0 4 mgc l ms2 lrv decreased from 4 2 lrv to 3 3 lrv when ms2 and srnom were simultaneously added to only 1 2 lrv when added sequentially the lrv of ms2 was therefore about 3 times lower than the value that we observed for the batch experiment in which srnom and ms2 were simultaneously added to 15 mg of mwcnt these results confirm that the formation of a negatively charged nom adlayer on the mwcnt surface impaired adsorption of ms2 at higher initial nom concentrations 1 mgc l the ms2 lrv was comparable irrespectively of whether srnom was preloaded to the mwcnt or simultaneously added with ms2 these srnom concentrations therefore were sufficiently high for srnom to outcompete ms2 for adsorption sites on the mwcnt even when the two adsorbates were simultaneously added figs 5a and 6 our results strongly suggest that virus adsorption by mwcnt based filters is impractical from waters that also contain nom to demonstrate that the results obtained with srnom are transferrable to natural waters with different types of nom we subsequently analyzed competitive co adsorption of ms2 and nom in different natural water samples furthermore we assessed the effect of ca2 on ms2 removal effect of water calcium concentration and water source on the competitive co adsorption of ms2 and nom to mwcnt adsorption of ms2 to mwcnt and other negatively charged viruses from natural waters will likely be influenced by factors beyond the concentration of nom as a co solute for example brady est√©vez et al 2010c showed that adding ca2 1 mm cacl2 to a solution containing ms2 and alginate increased by 1 2 the ms2 lrv by a mwcnt filter the authors ascribed this increased removal in the presence of ca2 to the formation of cation bridges between negatively charged groups in the nom adlayer and on the ms2 surface evidence for such cation bridges was provided already in earlier studies jermann et al 2007 pham et al 2009 enhanced virus lrv in presence of dissolved ca2 could imply that mwcnt may be used as a filter material for virus removal for waters that contain high ca2 concentrations or if ca2 is added to waters prior to the filtration step to assess whether ca2 alleviates competition by allowing ms2 to adsorb to nom adlayer we performed batch experiments with a fixed srnom concentration i e 4 8 mgc l and three different cacl2 concentrations i e 0 1 mmol l 1 9 mmol l and 7 5 mmol l lrv of ms2 increased with increasing ca2 concentration fig 7 a specifically at a concentration of 0 1 mmolca2 l ms2 lrv was equal to 0 4 0 3 but it increased to 3 3 0 3 and 4 5 0 3 at 1 9 mmol l and 7 5 mmol l respectively fig 7a yellow squares this finding implies that ca2 enhanced ms2 adsorption onto srnom adlayer likely by forming cationic bridges based on previous observation jermann et al 2007 pham et al 2009 however direct evidence confirming cationic bridges between nom adlayer and ms2 at the surface of the mwcnt remains missing given that ca2 alleviated competitive co adsorption of srnom and ms2 we also conducted additional ms2 removal experiments with natural waters containing different types of nom and a different ionic matrix than the dilution buffer used for the co solutes batch experiments to compare them to the previous batch experiments tap ground and river water as well as wastewater treatment plant secondary effluent were sampled twice december 2018 and january 2019 to obtain samples that contain a range of nom types and sources as well as ca2 concentration the water sources ranged in ca2 concentrations from 1 6 to 2 6 mmolca2 l and in doc concentrations between 0 91 and 9 77 mgc l we characterized differences in size and chemical functions of the nom in the different samples by lc ocd ond fig 8 specifically the percentage of the dissolved organic carbon that was present as biopolymers humics building blocks lmw organics and neutrals ranged from 0 2 to 24 37 9 to 78 6 7 to 20 4 0 5 to 5 4 and 13 6 to 19 5 respectively fig 8 for doc initial concentrations between 0 91 and 3 53 mgc l ms2 lrv varied between 2 7 and 3 3 which was higher than ms2 lrv observed for srnom co solute batch experiments at similar initial doc concentrations conducted without ca 2 fig 7b red circles interestingly these lrv values were comparable for the different natural nom samples irrespectively the initial doc concentration in the range 0 91 3 53 mgc l or the chemical composition in nom fig 8 contrary to what was measured for srnom co solute experiment without ca2 the difference in lrv value and trend observed between the batch experiments conducted in natural waters in the doc range of 0 91 and 3 53 and the srnom co solute experiments conducted without ca2 may be due to the presence of divalent and trivalent cations in natural waters that might mitigate the competitive co adsorption of ms2 and nom on mwcnt like ca2 that was present at similar concentrations in all natural water samples indeed the ms2 lrv measured for natural waters having an initial doc concentration between 0 91 and 3 53 mgc l was in a similar range than the ms2 lrv measured for the batch experiment performed with an initial srnom concentration of 4 8 mgc l and a ca2 concentration of 1 9 mmolca2 l overall the natural nom samples similar to srnom lowered ms2 lrv in comparison with single solute experiment with ms2 and mwcnt indicative of competitive co adsorption at low initial doc concentrations the competition was likely alleviated by the presence of divalent or trivalent cations especially ca2 as described above fig 7 however for initial doc concentrations higher than 3 53 mgc l ms2 lrv also decreased as initial nom concentration increased in the nom samples until reaching values close to zero for the batch experiments performed with secondary effluent irrespective ca2 concentration the findings highlight that competitive co adsorption is independent of natural water types and that the competition increased with increasing nom virus ratios and decreasing ca2 concentrations figs 7 and 8 we therefore conclude that while mwcnt may be a promising material for adsorption of virus in the absence of nom its application to virus removal in natural waters is expected to not be suitable due to the presence of nom which undergoes competitive co adsorption with the viruses competitive suppression of virus removal by nom is expected to occur for nom that vary broadly in chemical composition and also in waters that show varying ca2 concentrations 4 conclusion this study provides evidence for competitive co adsorption of ms2 and nom thereby highlighting that the occurrence of nom as a co solute in natural waters questions the suitability of mwcnt as a virus adsorbent to produce filters for pou systems despite the fact that mwcnt show outstanding adsorption properties in controlled systems we show that the presence of nom even at low doc concentration and in presence of ca2 competitively suppresses virus adsorption adsorption of srnom onto mwcnt impairs ms2 adsorption due to the formation of a negatively charged srnom adlayer on the mwcnt surface resulting in electrostatic repulsion of the net negatively charged ms2 from the adlayer this effect occurs irrespective of which mwcnt mass is used and irrespective of the initial nom concentration indeed batch experiments with ms2 and srnom as co solutes showed that ms2 lrv decreased exponentially with increasing srnom concentration down to very low lrv values at the highest tested srnom concentrations batch adsorption experiments with dissolved ca2 and natural water samples showed that nom of different sources and with varying chemical compositions competed with ms2 for adsorption onto the mwcnt although dissolved ca2 presence might punctually alleviated the nom competitive effect we expect that for most natural waters where virus nom ratio is low mwcnt should not be considered
