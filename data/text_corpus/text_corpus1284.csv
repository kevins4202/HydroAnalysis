urban wastewater collection systems which can cause problems such as sewer overloading sewer overflows and the reduction of treatment facilities efficiency zhang et al 2018 the inflow and infiltration can be estimated and calculated by some traditional flow based methods hydrological and hydraulic models have also been used to simulate and quantify inflow and infiltration processes in sewer systems the catchment surrounding hydrological processes and the interactions with the sewer networks are generally described by the distributed hydrological models models have been used include the mousenam the runoff routing rorb model and the rtk model used in swmm laurenson et al 1990 gustafsson et al 1999 all of these models were developed based on combining the components of fast runoff from imperious surfaces and slow infiltration from the surrounding soil karpf and krebs 2011 in order to run these models successfully it is required geospatial analysis calibrated and verified soil infiltration data boukhemacha et al 2015 mao et al 2016 these models are unsuitable to apply in the areas with limited infrastructure data furthermore abnormal flows are difficult for these models to deal with especially for backwater and overflow occurrence traditional wastewater monitoring parameters for assessing rdii include chemical oxygen demand cod kracht and gujer 2005 bareš et al 2009 total nitrogen shelton et al 2011 and total phosphorus mattsson et al 2016 some other water quality indicators such as natural occurring stable isotopes have also been used to assess rdii oliver et al 2007 houhou et al 2010 all these methods demonstrated successful capabilities to determine the inflow and infiltration nevertheless all these rdii assessment methods require intensive measurements which makes them uneconomic for long term management especially for large sewer systems it is also human resource consuming even for relative small systems mannina et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 discovered wastewater conductivity could be considered as a promising indicator and cost effective method for analyzing rdii an instantaneous unit hydrograph model was developed to estimate inflow and infiltration in sewer systems based on wastewater conductivity data zhang et al 2017 2018 this model had been applied to real time different rainfall events the implementation of the proposed model successfully identified the dynamic inflow and infiltration associated with rainfall entering the sewer system this rdii estimating method demonstrated advantages over the traditional flow based methods especially with the situations of abnormal flows such as backwater and overflow it was also less complicated to apply compared to the traditional hydrological and hydraulic models which require detailed infrastructure data the model reliability is established on the quality and quantity of monitoring data water quality data such as cod total nitrogen and total phosphorus is difficult and expensive to obtain however by reducing the amount of monitoring data can significantly increase the model uncertainty freni et al 2009 the application of this model and the implementation of the field monitoring in this study was simplified by only installing conductivity sensors at the correlated locations which provides continuous monitoring data at a low cost model simulation is always involved with model uncertainties the model uncertainty is usually originated from measured data model parameters and model structures saltelli et al 2017 global sensitivity analysis gsa is generally recommended for the assessment of modelling uncertainties deletic et al 2012 by minimizing model uncertainty datasets and probability distribution is selected and created different modelling tools are also compared for similar scenarios and results src e fast and morris screening are the three most widely used gsa methods the variance decomposition analysis could also be a promising approach for model uncertainty analysis freni and mannina 2010 model uncertainty analysis techniques such as glue generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation and mcmc markov chain monte carlo are commonly used methods mcmc shows its limitations includes likelihood function model misspecification risk glue requires a large number of repeat model simulations makowski et al 2002 the glue and mcmc had also been compared with scem ua shuffled complex evolution metropolis algorithm and amalgam a multialgorithm genetically adaptive multi objective method for a same model uncertainty analysis case study all four uncertainty analysis techniques deliver similar parameter probability distributions dotto et al 2012 among them glue is easy to implement and requires minimum modelling skills however the selection of uncertainty analysis technique should be based on the specific modelling scenario and feasibility of the system dotto et al 2012 for urban drainage models the uncertainty analysis is found to be more important for water quality parameters than water quantity factors vanrolleghem et al 2015 model parameters for water flow and hydraulic condition is significantly affected by imperviousness and rainfall events gamerith et al 2013 therefore parameter sensitivity ranking is commonly generated for water quality parameters while model uncertainty analysis results for water quantity parameters is usually used to describe system performance the aim of this paper is to assess the parameter uncertainty of the developed model in the proposed method the cascaded linear reservoirs assumption for inflow and infiltration introduced uncertainty into the model the evaluation on model simulation results should be determined based on uncertainty analysis the model is composed of dry weather flow conductivity and rdii sub model dwf and conductivity were determined by spectrum analysis the other model parameter uncertainty is directly originated from elements such as dwf and water quality fluctuation soil type and pervious surfaces pipe slope and roughness and rainfall types and events hence the main purpose is to evaluate the parameter uncertainty of the rdii model the influence of prior parameter distribution and likelihood threshold value on parameter uncertainty was analyzed the model parameter uncertainty was also evaluated with different areas different rainfall types and rainfall events 2 methodologies and materials 2 1 instantaneous unit hygrograph inflow infiltration model a novel conductivity based method was proposed for estimating rdii zhang et al 2018 an instantaneous unit hygrograph model was developed to estimate rdi and rii separately the dynamic inflow and infiltration associated with rainfall entering the sewer system was successfully identified with the implementation of the proposed method this cost effective and simplified method showed its advantages for assessing rdii over the traditional flow based methods the calculation of inflow and infiltration was evolved from some classical hydrology methods nash 1959 proposed an instantaneous unit hydrograph to calculate surface runoff the instantaneous unit hydrograph model was also called cascade reservoir model the rdii can be simulated as the final outflow of a series of cascaded linear reservoirs nash 1957 as shown in fig s4 the instantaneous unit hydrograph for the first and second cascaded linear reservoirs 1 u 2 0 t 1 k 1 k 2 e t k 1 e t k 2 where u 0 t is the instantaneous unit hydrograph k is the storage coefficient of the linear reservoirs n is the number of linear reservoirs in eq 2 when the discharge coefficient equals to the storage coefficient for the nth linear reservoir which is k1 k2 kn k the catchment outflow will be 2 u 0 t 1 k n 1 t k n 1 e t k the net rainfall entering the sewer system is defined as 3 h p r where h is the net rain entering the sewer pipe r represents the fractions of rainfall volume entering the sewers p is the rainfall depth per unit time the inflow and infiltration unit hydrograph for every single rainfall event is 4 q i 1 n h i q i δ t t where q is the total volume of inflow and infiltration the inflow and infiltration are different processes the total inflow and infiltration q can be divided into the inflow qrdi and infiltration qrii the pollutant concentrations in wastewater will be diluted during inflow and infiltration processes the pollutant concentration can be described using the mass balance equation 5 c wwf c dwf q dwf c rdi q rdi c rii q rii q wwf 6 q wwf q dwf q rdi q rii in eqs 5 and 6 cwwf represents in sewer pollutant concentration after rainfall events cdwf represents pollutant concentration during dry weather flow crdi and crii represents the concentration during inflow and infiltration qwwf qdwf qrdi qrii represents the flow rate for wet weather dry weather inflow and infiltration respectively parameters for dry weather flows can be obtained via spectrum analysis 6 parameters for wet weather model need calibration these parameters can be calibrated by the flow data and conductivity data after rainfall events spectrum analysis and fast fourier transform fft can be used to characterize dry weather flow and wastewater conductivity into sine functions components 7 y i 1 n a i sin 2 π f i t ϕ i c where y is the monitored flow rate or conductivity ai fi ϕ i represents the amplitude frequency and initial phase of the i th sine function respectively c is the average value of the diurnal variation of flow rate or conductivity from all equations above eq 6 can be written as 8 to represent the pollutant concentration in rdii 8 q wwf t q dwf t f i 1 n r rdi p i u rd i i δ t t f i 1 n r rii p i u ri i i δ t t where f represents the upstream sub catchment of the monitoring site r represents the fractions of rainfall volume entering the sewers p is the rainfall depth per unit time δt is the rainfall record time interval u δt t represents the unit rainfall during the period of δt the hydrological model and water quality model was integrated in this study wastewater conductivity was selected as the water quality indicator in this model the integration process has been illustrated in figure s3 based on the long term monitoring flow data and wastewater conductivity data the dwf and conductivity variation pattern is extracted by spectrum analysis then the rdii hydrograph is introduced the wwf is the sum of dwf and rdii model parameters are determined by fitting the monitored wwf the model parameters are also determined by fitting the wet weather conductivity and the conductivity pollutograph is generated with mass balance equation the hydrological model implemented the instantaneous hydrograph method the instantaneous hydrograph method was a half theoretical half empirical model the model parameter k reservior storage coefficients and n number of linear reserviors should be treated as empirical parameters the distributions of these parameters ought to be the comprehensive reflection of the physical parameters however it was difficult to locate the corresponding physical parameters for example the correlations between parameter k n and soil porosity pipe roughness therefore it is more practical to analyze the influence of different rainfall and parameter distribution on the model parameters in different areas and locations 2 2 uncertainty analysis method 2 2 1 markov chain monte carlo mcmc the markov chain monte carlo mcmc method was based on the theory of bayesian model averaging bma hoeting et al 1999 the model parameter θ was treated as a random variable in mcmc method assume the prior distribution of θ was p θ the posterior parameter distribution can be estimated by the bayesian method 9 p θ d p d θ p θ p d p d θ p θ θ p d θ p θ d θ p d is a constant eq 9 can be simplified 10 p θ d posterior p d θ likelihood p θ prior the application of probability models usually involves with complicated high dimensional integration these high dimensional integrations are difficult to solve by analytical solutions the iterative algorithm in mcmc method can be used to solve these integrations instead of the analytical solutions the characteristics of different distributions can be estimated by monte carlo method sampling in steady state distribution can be made by markov chain in random processes the aim of mcmc method is to set up a markov chain the stationary distribution of this chain is exactly the distribution for sampling the target distribution 2 2 2 glue method and uncertainty analysis glue method is generally used for model uncertainty analysis which adopts the concept of equifinality of models parameters and variables beven and binley 1992 it was developed from hornberger spear young hsy method which was initially used in sensitivity analysis based on a viewpoint that various combinations of parameter can generate similar model outputs hornberger and spear 1981 young 1983 the uncertainty analysis in this study consists of three mainly steps as shown in fig 1 fig 1 illustrates the general procedure of the glue method firstly determine the prior distribution for the parameters which is typically discrete or continuous uniform distribution secondly stochastic simulation based on the parameters defined previously with monte carlo method was used to do a random sampling of the parameter sets third rate the simulation and the corresponding parameter sets according to how they fit observed data for every single simulation if the simulated results are close to the observed values the simulation and this parameter set are accepted as a given likelihood ns value in this case otherwise this simulation and parameter set will be rejected the accepted parameter set likelihood will be adjusted by eq 11 11 p θ i l θ i y i 1 k l θ i y where θ i is the i th accepted parameter set l represents the likelihood of the parameter set k represents the number of the total accepted parameter sets for the posterior parameter distribution every single parameter set θ i is related to a p θ the parameter probability density function can be obtained based on the related likelihood the mean μ and deviation σ for every parameter θ can be calculated by eqs 12 and 13 respectively 12 μ θ i 1 k p θ i θ i 13 σ θ i 1 k p θ i θ i μ 2 repeat the main steps of glue method until iterations reach the set point 5000 iterations in this case calculate the cumulative distribution function cdf for all the accepted parameters the value corresponding to 5 and 95 of the cdf will be the 90 confidence interval of the parameters the model uncertainty is revealed through the cdf of the accepted simulation results 2 2 3 comparison of mcmc and glue the mcmc and glue method had been analysed and compared in a few studies the uncertainty of scour and cumulative model on different parameters was compared using both mcmc and glue method freni et al 2009a b the glue method had also been used in sewer sediment deposit and groundwater models jensen 2003 mannina et al 2012 these studies revealed that the bayesian is a classical method and is efficient to describe model uncertainties glue method also generates similar results but requires less assumptions with limited information in this study both the mcmc and glue method were applied into medium rainfall event to conduct uncertainty analysis the relationship of parameters was constrained as rrdi rrii krdi krii nrdi nrii the model results were compared in the results section 2 3 uncertainty of dwf and quality model parameters the dry weather flow rate and wastewater conductivity has regular periodic patterns while there are still daily variations the variations of dry weather flow and wastewater quality were based on the selection of suitable length of time which further influences the inflow and infiltration model results the online flow data and online conductivity data used for uncertainty analysis were shown in fig 2 the spectrum analysis was used to analyse the variations of dry weather flow and conductivity the spectrum analysis is a method to transform time domain signal to frequency domain signal the variations of flow rate and wastewater quality can be expressed by sine functions such as eq 13 13 y i 1 n a i sin 2 π f i t i c in eq 13 where y is the measured flow rate or conductivity ai fi i is the related sine functions amplitude frequency and initial phase respectively c is the daily average flow rate or conductivity the spectrum analysis and the sine function were used to evaluate the parameter distribution of different time period of dry weather flow the detailed divisions of dry weather flow and conductivity was shown in figure s1 in supplementary materials 2 4 uncertainty analysis in different scale of areas and locations the selected study catchment was in wuxi city jiangsu province east china it is 100 km to the west of shanghai the wwtp is located at the southeast of the catchment which serves an area of 85 km2 with roughly 733 000 residents the daily capacity of the wwtp is 200 000 m3 d the study catchment was constructed as combined sewer systems and there are 50 pumping stations in total five residential area locations five pumping stations and the wwtp were selected for model study the schematic of the sewer system and monitoring locations in the study catchment was shown in figure s2 the sub catchment area and pipe lengths for each monitoring locations was listed in table 1 where a b c d e represents the five monitoring locations at residential areas j l m x y represents five pumping stations for monitoring w represents wwtp in model simulations the online monitoring data include flow rate flow depth and conductivity the model simulation was divided into two groups the residential areas and the pump stations with wwtp the inflow and infiltration rate rrdi rrii and other four parameters krdi nrdi krii nrii were simulated in residential areas pump stations and wwtp respectively the model efficiency coefficient ns equation s1 was set to be greater than zero ns 0 the model simulation was running 3000 times using glue method random sampling 2 5 the selection of different rainfall types and rainfall events in order to evaluate the inflow and infiltration with different rainfall types and events three different rainfall types and events were defined and selected for model simulation the definition of small medium and heavy rainfall types was based on the total precipitation amount for a single rainfall event and the related hydraulic condition variation in the sewer pipes the amount of precipitation for small rainfall type was usually less than 20 mm in pipe flow depths was elevated during small rainfall events without damming occurring the amount of precipitation for medium rainfall type was between 20 and 80 mm flow depths was lifted and damming occurred simultaneously the amount of precipitation for heavy rainfall type was usually over 80 mm in pipe depths was significantly lifted the water volume entered the sewer network was far beyond the maximum capacity of the system abnormal flows occurred and malfunction on flow monitoring was observed three rainfall events for each rainfall type were selected and listed in table 2 l1 m1 and h1 was used for model calibration l2 l3 m2 m3 h2 and h3 was used for parameter verification the inflow and infiltration were evaluated with different rainfall conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 uncertainty analysis method 3 1 1 comparison of mcmc and glue the uncertainty analysis was conducted using both mcmc and glue method with medium rainfall event the comparison results were listed in fig 3 from fig 3 it can be seen the different results from the two methods especially for the parameters of rrii nrdi krii nrii the distributions of rrii krdi and nrdi in mcmc are less concentrated than that of glue and the glue related distributions are also smoother than the mcmc ones in mcmc method the parameter sampling was only in the range of prior distribution it was not able to specify the correlations between parameters in glue method the parameter correlations can be specified within the range of parameter sampling which means the glue method is an optimal option when dealing with this parameter uncertainty analysis 3 1 2 the influence of prior parameter distribution in uncertainty analysis the prior parameter distribution is based on empirical parameter distribution range it can be derived from physical significance or repeated simulation results the posterior distribution is the distribution based on uncertainty analysis results the interval of the posterior distribution is smaller than the prior distribution if the posterior distribution is based on a wide range of prior distribution the 90 confidence interval of the parameters would be undesirable however the prior distribution can be narrowed by defining the maximum and minimum parameter value table 3 summaries the 20 scope of the prior distribution based on model optimization in tables 3 and 4 l1 m1 h1 represents small medium and heavy rainfall events respectively it listed the 90 confidence interval of inflow rate rrdi and infiltration rate rrii for three rainfall events in table 4 for small rainfall events the 90 confidence interval of rrdi is 20 3 23 8 rrdi is 12 3 15 8 for medium rainfall events the 90 confidence interval of rrdi is 8 2 11 7 rrdi is 6 2 9 7 for heavy rainfall events the 90 confidence interval of rrdi is 6 2 9 8 rrdi is 2 1 4 8 3 1 3 the influence of likelihood value threshold four different thresholds of likelihood value were investigated for the model uncertainty results medium rainfall event was used the uncertainty analysis was running for 1000 times for each of the parameter if ns 0 445 samples were accepted if ns 0 2 276 samples were accepted if ns 0 4 127 samples were accepted if ns 0 5 61 samples were accepted the influence of likelihood value threshold were shown in fig 4 the impact of likelihood value threshold change was particular significant on the parameters of krdi and nrdi with the increase of ns value the distribution range of krdi was higher while the distribution range of nrdi was significantly narrowed when ns 0 5 about 80 nrdi samples were distributed within the range of 5 the cumulative distribution function of rrdi also turned close to s curve line from straight line which means it tended to normal distribution from uniform distribution there was no clear change on the distributions of the other four parameters 3 2 uncertainty analysis of dwf and quality model parameters table 5 shows the spectrum analysis results of amplitude phase and mean value with different divisions for the flow data for the frequency of 1d 1 the sine function amplitude was distributed in 45 110 m3 h with division a divided by every single day the amplitude was between 47 92 m3 h with division b every two days with division c every three days the amplitude distribution was further narrowed to 55 71 m3 h for division d which took 6 days as an entire period the 1d 1 frequency amplitude was fixed to 62 m3 h it can be seen from the results the amplitude was tended to be in the middle position with the increase of time length which reflects the mean value of the variation the variations of the phase and mean value were similar with different frequencies for a one day division the mean value was distributed between 97 148 m3 h for a two days division it was distributed within 103 126 m3 h the mean value was 118 m3 h for a 6 days period division it can be concluded from the spectrum analysis for different divisions that with the increase of flow data time length the impact of daily random fluctuations on regular dry weather flow variations could be reduced the different divisions for conductivity analysis obtained the similar results as flow rates shown in table 6 3 3 uncertainty analysis in different scale of areas and locations the model uncertainty analysis results in different areas and locations with medium rainfall event were listed in fig 5 it can be seen that the model parameter distributions were different at different regions and locations the rrdi at residential areas was between 10 30 the highest rrdi was observed at location c and it mainly distributed at areas over 20 the rrii of residential area mainly distributed at areas less than 20 the distribution ranges of rrdi and rrii of pump stations were smaller compared to the residential areas parameter distributions at different pump stations were significantly different take rrdi for example the parameter distribution of pump station m was between 3 10 while the distribution of pump station x was almost less than 3 the distribution curve shapes of rrdi and rrii were similar at all pump stations the infiltration rates for pump station m and l were high while they were relatively low at pump stations x and y pump j was similar to pump x and y the parameters were less sensitive if the distributions were close to straight line y x which means it was uniform distribution for the parameter at the sampling intervals it can be seen from fig 5 that the rrdi at residential areas a b and pump station m was less sensitive while the sensitivity was relatively high at residential areas c d and pump stations x y residential area c and pump station y got the highest krdi the distribution of nrdi of residential areas were mostly between 1 and 10 while the nrdi for pump stations were mainly distributed between 1 and 5 most of the krii distribution was over 10 the distribution of nrii was close to uniform distribution the cumulative probability distribution of all model parameters was different at every different areas and locations the distribution difference of rrdi and rrii mostly reflected the health conditions of sewer networks such as misconnection ratio and pipe damage the distribution difference of krdi nrdi krii nrii reflected the comprehensive physical characteristics of an area such as the size of the area pipe slopes and soil types 3 4 uncertainty analysis of different rainfall types and events 3 4 1 uncertainty analysis of different rainfall types the model parameter distribution of different rainfall types at the continuous monitoring locations were shown in fig 6 where l1 m1 and h1 represents small medium and heavy rainfall events respectviely it can be seen that all the parameter distributions were similar except the rrdi and rrii the distributions of rrdi at medium and heavy rainfall events were almost the same while its distribution at small rainfall events was quite different from the former two events the distributions of rrii at three rainfall events were all different the rrii of small rainfall events was higher than the rrii of heavy rainfall events which illustrated that the inflow and infiltration during heavy rainfall events exceeded the maiximum capacity of the sewer network the distribution difference of all parameters indicates that for a specific catchment area the main variations resulted from different rainfall types were rrdi and rrii parameters representing physical charateristics such as krdi nrdi krii and nrii had no significant changes it can be considered that it would be only necessary to calibrate rrdi and rrii for a specific catchment area with different rainfall types the same parameters of krdi nrdi krii and nrii can be directly used in different rainfall events 3 4 2 uncertainty analysis of different rainfall events all model parameters distribution at three different rainfall events were compared separately fig 7 shows the parameter distributions for three small rainfall events as similar to fig 6 except rrdi and rrii there was not much significant changes on parameter distributions for three small rainfall events the rrdi and rrii for the second small rainfall event l2 was much higher than the rrdi and rrii for the third rainfall event l3 this indicated that for small rainfall events the ratio of inflow and infiltration rates was variable due to conditions such as initial soil humidity and percipitation area distributions the parameter distributions at medium rainfall events were shown in fig 8 it can be seen that there was no significant difference for all parameter distributions it indicated that for medium rainfall events the initial soil humidity had low impact for all parameters the hydraulic conditions in sewer pipes were stable during medium rainfall events most of the water flows were dammed water in the sewer pipes backflow and overflow seldomly occurred the parameter distributions during three heavy rainfall events were also simulated shown in fig 9 there was clear difference on rrdi and rrii distributions during three heavy rainfall events and the distributions of krdi nrdi krii and nrii were similar to other rainfall types during heavy rainfall events the hydraulic conditions in sewer systems were complicated the flow had exceeded pumps capacity backflow and overflow also occurred at some areas due to the high water depth in the pipes the inflow and infiltration rates were more difficult to evaluate compared to small and medium rainfall events 3 5 uncertainty analysis of model outputs the uncertainty of inflow and infiltration model results under three different rainfall types was listed in fig 10 the posterior parameter distributions were obtained with a threshold value of ns 0 5 in glue method the model results include simulated conductivity and inflow and infiltration the probable distribution range was in the confidence interval of inflow and infiltration the confidence interval selected for conductivity and rdii was between 10 90 which was 80 the minimum flow rate for the small rainfall event l1 was 25 43 m3 h observed at the 2 9 day the maximum flow rate was 37 5 m3 h and appeared at the 2 7 day the minimum flow rate for the medium rainfall event m1 was 40 67 m3 h at the 1 8 day the maximum flow rate was 66 71 m3 h at the 1 7 day the minimum flow rate for the heavy rainfall event h1 was 316 m3 h observed at the 2 96 day the maximum flow rate was 620 m3 h and appeared at the 3 2 day the model results indicated the uncertainty of inflow and infiltration not only include the maximum and minimum flow rates but also the moments the peak flows appeared 4 conclusions in this paper the impact of different time length data on dry weather flow and wastewater quality was analyzed the model parameter uncertainty was also evaluated with different areas different rainfall types and different rainfall events the performance of different uncertainty analysis methods was compared for the parameter uncertainties the main conclusions can be summarized as 1 the glue was an optimal method compared to mcmc parameter sampling was made in the prior distribution range and the relationships between parameters could also be ensured during the sampling which made the glue method more flexible once a desirable prior distribution was selected the confidence interval of the posterior distribution could be obtained the parameter distributions were influenced by increasing the likelihood threshold value especially the distribution of krdi and nrdi 2 the impact of daily random fluctuations on dry weather flows and wastewater qualities could be reduced by selecting a longer period of dry weather flow data 3 the model parameter cumulative distribution was different at all different areas and locations the rrdi and rrii of wwtp and pump station was all less than 10 however the distribution differences were relatively high at residential areas the distribution difference of rrdi and rrii reflected the health conditions of the sewer network the distribution difference of krdi nrdi krii nrii reflected the comprehensive physical characteristics of a catchment area such as the size of the area pipe slopes and soil types 4 for the impact of different rainfall types and events on parameter distribution at the same locations the distribution difference of rrdi and rrii was significant for small and heavy rainfall types all parameter distributions were similar for medium rainfall types this indicated small rainfall was influenced by initial physical conditions and heavy rainfall was affected by the hydraulic conditions in sewer pipes the confidence interval of the simulated conductivity and inflow and infiltration were obtained based on the posterior parameter distributions acknowledgments this research was supported by the national natural science foundation of china no 51678337 major science

uncertainty analysis technique should be based on the specific modelling scenario and feasibility of the system dotto et al 2012 for urban drainage models the uncertainty analysis is found to be more important for water quality parameters than water quantity factors vanrolleghem et al 2015 model parameters for water flow and hydraulic condition is significantly affected by imperviousness and rainfall events gamerith et al 2013 therefore parameter sensitivity ranking is commonly generated for water quality parameters while model uncertainty analysis results for water quantity parameters is usually used to describe system performance the aim of this paper is to assess the parameter uncertainty of the developed model in the proposed method the cascaded linear reservoirs assumption for inflow and infiltration introduced uncertainty into the model the evaluation on model simulation results should be determined based on uncertainty analysis the model is composed of dry weather flow conductivity and rdii sub model dwf and conductivity were determined by spectrum analysis the other model parameter uncertainty is directly originated from elements such as dwf and water quality fluctuation soil type and pervious surfaces pipe slope and roughness and rainfall types and events hence the main purpose is to evaluate the parameter uncertainty of the rdii model the influence of prior parameter distribution and likelihood threshold value on parameter uncertainty was analyzed the model parameter uncertainty was also evaluated with different areas different rainfall types and rainfall events 2 methodologies and materials 2 1 instantaneous unit hygrograph inflow infiltration model a novel conductivity based method was proposed for estimating rdii zhang et al 2018 an instantaneous unit hygrograph model was developed to estimate rdi and rii separately the dynamic inflow and infiltration associated with rainfall entering the sewer system was successfully identified with the implementation of the proposed method this cost effective and simplified method showed its advantages for assessing rdii over the traditional flow based methods the calculation of inflow and infiltration was evolved from some classical hydrology methods nash 1959 proposed an instantaneous unit hydrograph to calculate surface runoff the instantaneous unit hydrograph model was also called cascade reservoir model the rdii can be simulated as the final outflow of a series of cascaded linear reservoirs nash 1957 as shown in fig s4 the instantaneous unit hydrograph for the first and second cascaded linear reservoirs 1 u 2 0 t 1 k 1 k 2 e t k 1 e t k 2 where u 0 t is the instantaneous unit hydrograph k is the storage coefficient of the linear reservoirs n is the number of linear reservoirs in eq 2 when the discharge coefficient equals to the storage coefficient for the nth linear reservoir which is k1 k2 kn k the catchment outflow will be 2 u 0 t 1 k n 1 t k n 1 e t k the net rainfall entering the sewer system is defined as 3 h p r where h is the net rain entering the sewer pipe r represents the fractions of rainfall volume entering the sewers p is the rainfall depth per unit time the inflow and infiltration unit hydrograph for every single rainfall event is 4 q i 1 n h i q i δ t t where q is the total volume of inflow and infiltration the inflow and infiltration are different processes the total inflow and infiltration q can be divided into the inflow qrdi and infiltration qrii the pollutant concentrations in wastewater will be diluted during inflow and infiltration processes the pollutant concentration can be described using the mass balance equation 5 c wwf c dwf q dwf c rdi q rdi c rii q rii q wwf 6 q wwf q dwf q rdi q rii in eqs 5 and 6 cwwf

parameters for wet weather model need calibration these parameters can be calibrated by the flow data and conductivity data after rainfall events spectrum analysis and fast fourier transform fft can be used to characterize dry weather flow and wastewater conductivity into sine functions components 7 y i 1 n a i sin 2 π f i t ϕ i c where y is the monitored flow rate or conductivity ai fi ϕ i represents the amplitude frequency and initial phase of the i th sine function respectively c is the average value of the diurnal variation of flow rate or conductivity from all equations above eq 6

of the monitoring site r represents the fractions of rainfall volume entering the sewers p is the rainfall depth per unit time δt is the rainfall record time interval u δt t represents the unit rainfall during the period of δt the hydrological model and water quality model was integrated in this study wastewater conductivity was selected as the water quality indicator in this model the integration process has been illustrated in figure s3 based on the long term monitoring flow data and wastewater conductivity data the dwf and conductivity variation pattern is extracted by spectrum analysis then the rdii hydrograph is introduced the wwf is the sum of dwf and rdii model parameters are determined by fitting the monitored wwf the model parameters are also determined by fitting the wet weather conductivity and the conductivity pollutograph is generated with mass balance equation the hydrological model implemented the instantaneous hydrograph method the instantaneous hydrograph method was a half theoretical half empirical model the model parameter k reservior storage coefficients and n number of linear reserviors should be treated as empirical parameters the distributions of these parameters ought to be the comprehensive reflection of the physical parameters however it was difficult to locate the corresponding physical parameters for example the correlations between parameter k n and soil porosity pipe roughness therefore it is more practical to analyze the influence of different rainfall and parameter distribution on the model parameters in different areas and locations 2 2 uncertainty analysis method 2 2 1 markov chain monte carlo mcmc the markov chain monte carlo mcmc method was based on the theory of bayesian model averaging bma hoeting et al 1999 the model parameter θ was treated as a random variable in mcmc method assume the prior distribution of θ was p θ the posterior parameter distribution can be estimated by the bayesian method 9 p θ d p d θ p θ p d p d θ p θ θ p d θ p θ d θ p d is a constant eq 9 can be simplified 10 p θ d posterior p d θ likelihood p θ prior the application of probability models usually involves with complicated high dimensional integration these high dimensional integrations are difficult to solve by analytical solutions the iterative algorithm in mcmc method can be used to solve these integrations instead of the analytical solutions the characteristics of different distributions can be estimated by monte carlo method sampling in steady state distribution can be made by markov chain in random processes the aim of mcmc method is to set up a markov chain the stationary distribution of this chain is exactly the distribution for sampling the target distribution 2 2 2 glue method and uncertainty analysis glue method is generally used for model uncertainty analysis which adopts the concept of equifinality of models parameters and variables beven and binley 1992 it was developed from hornberger spear young hsy method which was initially used in sensitivity analysis based on a viewpoint that various combinations of parameter can generate similar model outputs hornberger and spear 1981 young 1983 the uncertainty analysis in this study consists of three mainly steps as shown in fig 1 fig 1 illustrates the general procedure of the glue method firstly determine the prior distribution for the parameters which is typically discrete or continuous uniform distribution secondly stochastic simulation based on the parameters defined previously with monte carlo method was used to do a random sampling of the parameter sets third rate the simulation and the corresponding parameter sets according to how they fit observed data for every single simulation if the simulated results are close to the observed values the simulation and this parameter set are accepted as a given likelihood ns value in this case otherwise this simulation and parameter set will be rejected the accepted parameter set likelihood will be adjusted by eq 11 11 p θ i l θ i y i 1 k l θ i y where θ i is the i th accepted parameter set l represents the likelihood of the parameter set k represents the number of the total accepted parameter sets for the posterior parameter distribution every single parameter set θ i is related to a p θ the parameter probability density function can be obtained based on the related likelihood the mean μ and deviation σ for every parameter θ can be calculated by eqs 12 and 13 respectively 12 μ θ i 1 k p θ i θ i 13 σ θ i 1 k p θ i θ i μ 2 repeat the main steps of glue method until iterations reach the set point 5000 iterations in this case calculate the cumulative distribution function cdf for all the accepted parameters the value corresponding to 5 and 95 of the cdf will be the 90 confidence interval of the parameters the model uncertainty is revealed through the cdf of the accepted simulation results 2 2 3 comparison of mcmc and glue the mcmc and glue method had been analysed and compared in a few studies the uncertainty of scour and cumulative model on different parameters was compared using both mcmc and glue method freni et al 2009a b the glue method had also been used in sewer sediment deposit and groundwater models jensen 2003 mannina et al 2012 these studies revealed that the bayesian is a classical method and is efficient to describe model uncertainties glue method also generates similar results but requires less assumptions with limited information in this study both the mcmc and glue method were applied into medium rainfall event to conduct uncertainty analysis the relationship of parameters was constrained as rrdi rrii krdi krii nrdi nrii the model results were compared in the results section 2 3 uncertainty of dwf and quality model parameters the dry weather flow rate and wastewater conductivity has regular periodic patterns while there are still daily variations the variations of dry weather flow and wastewater quality were based on the selection of suitable length of time which further influences the inflow and infiltration model results the online flow data and online conductivity data used for uncertainty analysis were shown in fig 2 the spectrum analysis was used to analyse the variations of dry weather flow and conductivity the spectrum analysis is a method to transform time domain signal to frequency domain signal the variations of flow rate and wastewater quality can be expressed by sine functions such as eq 13 13 y i 1 n a i sin 2 π f i t i c in eq 13 where y is the measured flow rate or conductivity ai fi i is the related sine functions amplitude frequency and initial phase respectively c is the daily average flow rate or conductivity the spectrum analysis and the sine function were used to evaluate the parameter distribution of different time period of dry weather flow the detailed divisions of dry weather flow and conductivity was shown in figure s1 in supplementary materials 2 4 uncertainty analysis in different scale of areas and locations the selected study catchment was in wuxi city jiangsu province east china it is 100 km to the west of shanghai the wwtp is located at the southeast of the catchment which serves an area of 85 km2 with roughly 733 000 residents the daily capacity of the wwtp is 200 000 m3 d the study catchment was constructed as combined sewer systems and there are 50 pumping stations in total five residential area locations five pumping stations and the wwtp were selected for model study the schematic of the sewer system and monitoring locations in the study catchment was shown in figure s2 the sub catchment area and pipe lengths for each monitoring locations was listed in table 1 where a b c d e represents the five monitoring locations at residential areas j l m x y represents five pumping stations for monitoring w represents wwtp in model simulations the online monitoring data include flow rate flow depth and conductivity the model simulation was divided into two groups the residential areas and the pump stations with wwtp the inflow and infiltration rate rrdi rrii and other four parameters krdi nrdi krii nrii were simulated in residential areas pump stations and wwtp respectively the model efficiency coefficient ns equation s1 was set to be greater than zero ns 0 the model simulation was running 3000 times using glue method random sampling 2 5 the selection of different rainfall types and rainfall events in order to evaluate the inflow and infiltration with different rainfall types and events three different rainfall types and events were defined and selected for model simulation the definition of small medium and heavy rainfall types was based on the total precipitation amount for a single rainfall event and the related hydraulic condition variation in the sewer pipes the amount of precipitation for small rainfall type was usually less than 20 mm in pipe flow depths was elevated during small rainfall events without damming occurring the amount of precipitation for medium rainfall type was between 20 and 80 mm flow depths was lifted and damming occurred simultaneously the amount of precipitation for heavy rainfall type was usually over 80 mm in pipe depths was significantly lifted the water volume entered the sewer network was far beyond the maximum capacity of the system abnormal flows occurred and malfunction on flow monitoring was observed three rainfall events for each rainfall type were selected and listed in table 2 l1 m1 and h1 was used for model calibration l2 l3 m2 m3 h2 and h3 was used for parameter verification the inflow and infiltration were evaluated with different rainfall conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 uncertainty analysis method 3 1 1 comparison of mcmc and glue the uncertainty analysis was conducted using both mcmc and glue method with medium rainfall event the comparison results were listed in fig 3 from fig 3 it can be seen the different results from the two methods especially for the parameters of rrii nrdi krii nrii the distributions of rrii krdi and nrdi in mcmc are less concentrated than that of glue and the glue related distributions are also smoother than the mcmc ones in mcmc method the parameter sampling was only in the range of prior distribution it was not able to specify the correlations between parameters in glue method the parameter correlations can be specified within the range of parameter sampling which means the glue method is an optimal option when dealing with this parameter uncertainty analysis 3 1 2 the influence of prior parameter distribution in uncertainty analysis the prior parameter distribution is based on empirical parameter distribution range it can be derived from physical significance or repeated simulation results the posterior distribution is the distribution based on uncertainty analysis results the interval of the posterior distribution is smaller than the prior distribution if the posterior distribution is based on a wide range of prior distribution the 90 confidence interval of the parameters would be undesirable however the prior distribution can be narrowed by defining the maximum and minimum parameter value table 3 summaries the 20 scope of the prior distribution based on model optimization in tables 3 and 4 l1 m1 h1 represents small medium and heavy rainfall events respectively it listed the 90 confidence interval of inflow rate rrdi and infiltration rate rrii for three rainfall events in table 4 for small rainfall events the 90 confidence interval of rrdi is 20 3 23 8 rrdi is 12 3 15 8 for medium rainfall events the 90 confidence interval of rrdi is 8 2 11 7 rrdi is 6 2 9 7 for heavy rainfall events the 90 confidence interval of rrdi is 6 2 9 8 rrdi is 2 1 4 8 3 1 3 the influence of likelihood value threshold four different thresholds of likelihood value were investigated for the model uncertainty results medium rainfall event was used the uncertainty analysis was running for 1000 times for each of the parameter if ns 0 445 samples were accepted if ns 0 2 276 samples were accepted if ns 0 4 127 samples were accepted if ns 0 5 61 samples were accepted the influence of likelihood value threshold were shown in fig 4 the impact of likelihood value threshold change was particular significant on the parameters of krdi and nrdi with the increase of ns value the distribution range of krdi was higher while the distribution range of nrdi was significantly narrowed when ns 0 5 about 80 nrdi samples were distributed within the range of 5 the cumulative distribution function of rrdi also turned close to s curve line from straight line which means it tended to normal distribution from uniform distribution there was no clear change on the distributions of the other four parameters 3 2 uncertainty analysis of dwf and quality model parameters table 5 shows the spectrum analysis results of amplitude phase and mean value with different divisions for the flow data for the frequency of 1d 1 the sine function amplitude was distributed in 45 110 m3 h with division a divided by every single day the amplitude was between 47 92 m3 h with division b every two days with division c every three days the amplitude distribution was further narrowed to 55 71 m3 h for division d which took 6 days as an entire period the 1d 1 frequency amplitude was fixed to 62 m3 h it can be seen from the results the amplitude was tended to be in the middle position with the increase of time length which reflects the mean value of the variation the variations of the phase and mean value were similar with different frequencies for a one day division the mean value was distributed between 97 148 m3 h for a two days division it was distributed within 103 126 m3 h the mean value was 118 m3 h for a 6 days period division it can be concluded from the spectrum analysis for different divisions that with the increase of flow data time length the impact of daily random fluctuations on regular dry weather flow variations could be reduced the different divisions for conductivity analysis obtained the similar results as flow rates shown in table 6 3 3 uncertainty analysis in different scale of areas and locations the model uncertainty analysis results in different areas and locations with medium rainfall event were listed in fig 5 it can be seen that the model parameter distributions were different at different regions and locations the rrdi at residential areas was between 10 30 the highest rrdi was observed at location c and it mainly distributed at areas over 20 the rrii of residential area mainly distributed at areas less than 20 the distribution ranges of rrdi and rrii of pump stations were smaller compared to the residential areas parameter distributions at different pump stations were significantly different take rrdi for example the parameter distribution of pump station m was between 3 10 while the distribution of pump station x was almost less than 3 the distribution curve shapes of rrdi and rrii were similar at all pump stations the infiltration rates for pump station m and l were high while they were relatively low at pump stations x and y pump j was similar to pump x and y the parameters were less sensitive if the distributions were close to straight line y x which means it was uniform distribution for the parameter at the sampling intervals it can be seen from fig 5 that the rrdi at residential areas a b and pump station m was less sensitive while the sensitivity was relatively high at residential areas c d and pump stations x y residential area c and pump station y got the highest krdi the distribution of nrdi of residential areas were mostly between 1 and 10 while the nrdi for pump stations were mainly distributed between 1 and 5 most of the krii distribution was over 10 the distribution of nrii was close to uniform distribution the cumulative probability distribution of all model parameters was different at every different areas and locations the distribution difference of rrdi and rrii mostly reflected the health conditions of sewer networks such as misconnection ratio and pipe damage the distribution difference of krdi nrdi krii nrii reflected the comprehensive physical characteristics of an area such as the size of the area pipe slopes and soil types 3 4 uncertainty analysis of different rainfall types and events 3 4 1 uncertainty analysis of different rainfall types the model parameter distribution of different rainfall types at the continuous monitoring locations were shown in fig 6 where l1 m1 and h1 represents small medium and heavy rainfall events respectviely it can be seen that all the parameter distributions were similar except the rrdi and rrii the distributions of rrdi at medium and heavy rainfall events were almost the same while its distribution at small rainfall events was quite different from the former two events the distributions of rrii at three rainfall events were all different the rrii of small rainfall events was higher than the rrii of heavy rainfall events which illustrated that the inflow and infiltration during heavy rainfall events exceeded the maiximum capacity of the sewer network the distribution difference of all parameters indicates that for a specific catchment area the main variations resulted from different rainfall types were rrdi and rrii parameters representing physical charateristics such as krdi nrdi krii and nrii had no significant changes it can be considered that it would be only necessary to calibrate rrdi and rrii for a specific catchment area with different rainfall types the same parameters of krdi nrdi krii and nrii can be directly used in different rainfall events 3 4 2 uncertainty analysis of different rainfall events all model parameters distribution at three different rainfall events were compared separately fig 7 shows the parameter distributions for three small rainfall events as similar to fig 6 except rrdi and rrii there was not much significant changes on parameter distributions for three small rainfall events the rrdi and rrii for the second small rainfall event l2 was much higher than the rrdi and rrii for the third rainfall event l3 this indicated that for small rainfall events the ratio of inflow and infiltration rates was variable due to conditions such as initial soil humidity and percipitation area distributions the parameter distributions at medium rainfall events were shown in fig 8 it can be seen that there was no significant difference for all parameter distributions it indicated that for medium rainfall events the initial soil humidity had low impact for all parameters the hydraulic conditions in sewer pipes were stable during medium rainfall events most of the water flows were dammed water in the sewer pipes backflow and overflow seldomly occurred the parameter distributions during three heavy rainfall events were also simulated shown in fig 9 there was clear difference on rrdi and rrii distributions during three heavy rainfall events and the distributions of krdi nrdi krii and nrii were similar to other rainfall types during heavy rainfall events the hydraulic conditions in sewer systems were complicated the flow had exceeded pumps capacity backflow and overflow also occurred at some areas due to the high water depth in the pipes the inflow and infiltration rates were more difficult to evaluate compared to small and medium rainfall events 3 5 uncertainty analysis of model outputs the uncertainty of inflow and infiltration model results under three different rainfall types was listed in fig 10 the posterior parameter distributions were obtained with a threshold value of ns 0 5 in glue method the model results include simulated conductivity and inflow and infiltration the probable distribution range was in the confidence interval of inflow and infiltration the confidence interval selected for conductivity and rdii was between 10 90 which was 80 the minimum flow rate for the small rainfall event l1 was 25 43 m3 h observed at the 2 9 day the maximum flow rate was 37 5 m3 h and appeared at the 2 7 day the minimum flow rate for the medium rainfall event m1 was 40 67 m3 h at the 1 8 day the maximum flow rate was 66 71 m3 h at the 1 7 day the minimum flow rate for the heavy rainfall event h1 was 316 m3 h observed at the 2 96 day the maximum flow rate was 620 m3 h and appeared at the 3 2 day the model results indicated the uncertainty of inflow and infiltration not only include the maximum and minimum flow rates but also the moments the peak flows appeared 4 conclusions in this paper the impact of different time length data on dry weather flow and wastewater quality was analyzed the model parameter uncertainty was also evaluated with different areas different rainfall types and different rainfall events the performance of different uncertainty analysis methods was compared for the parameter uncertainties the main conclusions can be summarized as 1 the glue was an optimal method compared to mcmc parameter sampling was made in the prior distribution range and the relationships between parameters could also be ensured during the sampling which made the glue method more flexible once a desirable prior distribution was selected the confidence interval of the posterior distribution could be obtained the parameter distributions were influenced by increasing the likelihood threshold value especially the distribution of krdi and nrdi 2 the impact of daily random fluctuations on dry weather flows and wastewater qualities could be reduced by selecting a longer period of dry weather flow data 3 the model parameter cumulative distribution was different at all different areas and locations the rrdi and rrii of wwtp and pump station was all less than 10 however the distribution differences were relatively high at residential areas the distribution difference of rrdi and rrii reflected the health conditions of the sewer network the distribution difference of krdi nrdi krii nrii reflected the comprehensive physical characteristics of a catchment area such as the size of the area pipe slopes and soil types 4 for the impact of different rainfall types and events on parameter distribution at the same locations the distribution difference of rrdi and rrii was significant for small and heavy rainfall types all parameter distributions were similar for medium rainfall types this indicated small rainfall was influenced by initial physical conditions and heavy rainfall was affected by the hydraulic conditions in sewer pipes the confidence interval of the simulated conductivity and inflow and infiltration were obtained based on the posterior parameter distributions acknowledgments this research was supported by the national natural science foundation of china no 51678337 major science

6421,river confluences are pivotal junctions that have vital influences on hydraulic characteristics and sediment particle distributions as well as on hyporheic water exchange however hyporheic water exchange is poorly understood because of the complicated river morphology within a river confluence therefore the river confluence between the juehe river and haohe river located in arid and semi arid areas of northwestern china was selected to evaluate the hyporheic water exchange processes and the temperatures of different depth sediment were measured on july 11th and 12th 2016 by an instrument equipped with five temperature sensors the patterns and magnitudes of hyporheic water exchange were estimated using a one dimensional heat transport model coupled with temperature data meanwhile terrain points elevations and sediment particle distributions in this river confluence were collected to determine the confluence riverbed morphology furthermore the river confluence morphology effects on hyporheic water exchange were investigated in this study the different riverbed morphology and hydrodynamic zone locations were observed which were controlled by the planform geometry with low river confluence flux momentum during the test period meanwhile the upwelling flow dominated in the test area and the downwelling occurred at three of the 23 total test points which was induced by the complicated riverbed morphology and hydraulic characteristics additionally the magnitudes of the upwelling flow were significantly influenced by the sediment heterogeneity subjected to the erosional and depositional processes hyporheic water exchange is a vital hydrological process in arid and semi arid areas where it significantly impacts the ecological environment of rivers this study provides a valuable guideline for water quality and quantity management in arid and semi arid areas keywords river confluence morphology hydraulic characteristics sedimentary properties hyporheic water exchange 1 introduction rivers are a typical geomorphic feature on the earth s land surface with a variety of environmental and service functions surface water and groundwater are not independent hydrological systems boulton et al 1998 chen et al 2017b surface groundwater exchange commonly occurs in the hyporheic zone of rivers jones and holmes 1996 the hyporheic zone is the sediment layer within the riverbed that is saturated with water and is located in the intermediate zone between surface water and groundwater which is the zone that connects rivers and groundwater systems boulton et al 1998 zarnetske et al 2012 cranswick et al 2014 hyporheic water exchange drives the physical chemical and biological characteristics of the hyporheic zone controls interaction between the surface water and groundwater brunke and gonser 1997 and further influences the quality and quantity of surface water and groundwater kalbus et al 2007 chen et al 2018 meanwhile the hyporheic zone is regarded as the liver of the river due to biodegradation and adsorption of pollutants within river systems storey et al 2004 fischer et al 2005 briggs et al 2014 hence research on hyporheic water exchange has gradually attracted the attention of researchers and has become vital in international studies krause et al 2009 furthermore in arid and semi arid regions hyporheic water exchange is an extremely important hydrologic process that has significant effects on the water quality and quantity of rivers due to the reduced precipitation rainfall capacity wang et al 2008 2013 chen et al 2017a the accurate estimation of hyporheic water exchange patterns and magnitudes is an essential task in the research of water exchange in previous studies many methods were used to determine the patterns and magnitudes of hyporheic water exchange including tracer tests yang et al 2012 the darcy equation anderson 2005 thermal methods hatch et al 2006 seepage meters zhu et al 2015 and other methods wei et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 however different measurement scales and hydrogeological conditions limit the application of these methods in field studies for example tracer tests and baseflow separation determine ground surface water exchange at the catchment scale hatch et al 2006 and a seepage meter is generally used to assess riverbed seepage within relatively smooth riverbeds zhu et al 2015 heat has been increasingly used to estimate the hyporheic water exchange patterns and magnitudes because heat is a valid natural tracer that can be used on multiple scales anderson 2005 hatch et al 2006 remarkably collecting and measuring temperature data in the hyporheic zone is simple and convenient in many field studies stallman 1965 developed a one dimensional heat transport model that estimated hyporheic water exchange processes based on the theory that hyporheic water flow occurs simultaneously with heat transfer bredehoeft and papaopulos 1965 proposed a one dimensional steady state heat model based on the steady state thermal assumption furthermore the model was developed by anibas et al 2009 to evaluate the hyporheic water exchange patterns and magnitudes on various stream topographies engelhardt et al 2011 collected temperature data to study groundwater surface water interactions in schwarzbach germany by the model wang et al 2018 measured riverbed temperatures and sampled riverbed sediment in the weihe river to estimate hyporheic water exchange and further analyze the effect of water exchange on inorganic nitrogen within pore water the topography of the river bank or riverbed has a significant influence on hyporheic water exchange kasahara and wondzell 2003 hill et al 1998 found that changes in longitudinal gradients in stream channel riffle pool units induced small scale vertical and horizontal hyporheic water exchanges meanwhile boano et al 2006 indicated that the process of surface groundwater exchange in river bends is more significant relative to that in straight channels however deposition and erosion caused by flow along river bends also influences the hyporheic flow through river sediment song et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 gravel bars are also a common topographic feature in a natural channel wondzell and swanson 1999 found that while lateral flow typically dominates gravel bars a large flood event created extensive hyporheic zones with increased downward flux at the head of several gravel bars while lateral downstream river bar interactions were maintained thus the patterns and magnitudes of hyporheic water exchange are easily induced by the river bank topography or riverbed forms such as riffle pools gravel bars and river bends boano et al 2006 shope et al 2012 stonedahl et al 2013 however the vast majority of studies have focused on the effects of relatively large geomorphological structures on hyporheic water exchange wondzell and swanson 1999 stonedahl et al 2013 under complex river topographic conditions small scale variability in hyporheic water exchange affected by river morphology at a river confluence is still not fully understood therefore estimating hyporheic water exchange and analyzing the influences of riverbed morphology on patterns and magnitudes of hyporheic water exchange not only provide a useful clue to understanding the hydrological processes but also provide a vital guide for the management of water quantity and quality in arid and semi arid regions a river confluence is an important morphological element in the river system the morphology of the river confluence commonly consists of an avalanche face confluence scour and separation zone bar best 1988 the avalanche face produced by severe flow deflection rapid growth rate and shear stress when the two streams entered the confluence is more pronounced at higher confluence angles confluence scour refers to the scouring ditch formed by the increase in velocity and turbulence level at the junction when the two streams merge the separation zone bar is located at the corner of the lower reaches which is formed by the lower fluid velocity and pressure when the sediment from the tributaries is involved in the separation area best 1986 best and rhoads 2008 all of these features of flow dynamics and sediment transport within the river confluence such as erosion and deposition processes are induced by the river confluence morphology boano et al 2006 furthermore the characteristics of flow dynamics and grain size distributions including silt clay as well as median grain size d50 significantly influence the hyporheic water exchange patterns and magnitudes song et al 2016 in this study the river confluence between juehe river and haohe river located in the arid and semi arid areas of northwestern china was selected to evaluate the hyporheic water exchange processes and the temperatures data of different sediment layers were measured on july 11 and 12 2016 and used to quantitatively estimate the patterns and magnitudes of hyporheic water exchange using the one dimensional steady state heat transport model meanwhile the river confluence morphology was measured and sediment was sampled in the field study the particle size of the sediment was analyzed in the laboratory the objectives of this study are to 1 investigate the morphological features of a river confluence 2 estimate the spatial variability of the magnitudes and patterns of hyporheic water exchange and 3 further explore the effects of river morphology and sediment grain size distribution on hyporheic water exchange in the test area 2 study area the study was conducted in the confluence of the juehe river main channel and haohe river tributary channel and was performed in xi an city shaanxi province china on july 11 and 12 2016 the juehe river is a secondary tributary of the weihe river in the guanzhong plain the juehe river total length and drainage area are 64 2 km and 687 km2 respectively the haohe river has a total length of 46 km and a drainage area of 292 km2 the haohe river flows into the juehe river near the xiangji temple in the southern portion of xi an city the two streams both originate from the tsinling mountains and finally flow into the weihe river the juehe river basin is located in an arid and semiarid climate zone with an average annual rainfall of approximately 660 mm guo et al 2018 the weather in the juehe river basin is hot and rainy in summer and cold and dry in winter song et al 2015 similar to most rivers in arid and semi arid areas juehe river presents active interactions between surface water and groundwater that significantly impact the heavy metal and nitrogen concentration of surface water and groundwater liu et al 2017 guo et al 2018 in addition the juehe and haohe rivers both located in the southern weihe river basin and near the tsinling mountains contain bed materials largely composed of coarse sand gravel and even cobbles which easily induces significant hyporheic water exchange meanwhile the two rivers are crucial for human health and economic consumption on the guanzhong plain in shaanxi province which includes xi an city zhi et al 2013 the test site is located in the confluence of the juehe and haohe rivers which is in the southern portion of xi an city fig 1 a field measurements were conducted and a total of 23 test points were established in the confluence fig 1b nine test points were established in the tributary channel t five test points were established in the main channel m and another nine test points were established in the postconfluence main channel pm each transect included 2 or 3 test points with 10 15 m spacing based on morphological features observed during field measurements in addition no test point was established in the center of the confluence due to equipment length limitations from july 9 to 13 2016 rainfall events did not occur and the groundwater level and river level were stabilized in test area which was important for avoiding the influence of climatic conditions on hyporheic water exchange 3 method 3 1 sediment temperature measurements during the test period temperature data of specific depth sediment layers at the 23 test points were collected by a 2 0 m instrument equipped with 5 temperature sensors at specific depths 0 0 m 0 1 m 0 2 m 0 3 m and 0 45 m fig 1c the lower part of the instrument was marked with a length scale to insert the instrument into the sediment at a depth of 0 45 m five temperature sensors were used to collect specific depth sediment layer temperature data the temperature sensors in different sediment layers began working after the instrument was inserted into the river sediment a measurement required approximately 30 min for the temperature sensors to reach thermal steady state conditions the instrument also consists of a data logger that can continuously record and store temperature data of the five sensors fig 1c the instrument with an accuracy of 0 05 c was calibrated to obtain accurate temperature data after each measurement then the measured temperature data and other physical parameters were input to a one dimensional heat transport model provided by bredehoeft and papaopulos 1965 to obtain the hyporheic water exchange patterns and magnitudes 3 2 one dimensional heat transport model heat is a vital natural tracer in the determination of hyporheic water exchange patterns and magnitudes anibas et al 2009 stallman 1965 developed the following equation to estimated patterns and magnitudes of hyporheic water exchange under the assumption that river sediment is isotropic homogeneous and saturated 1 2 t x 2 2 t y 2 2 t z 2 c f ρ f k v x t x v y t y v z t z c fs ρ fs k t t where t temperature

components of fluid velocity in the x y and z directions x y z cartesian coordinates t time the expression v x v y 0 is based on the assumption that hyporheic water exchange is one dimensional in the

were very small over time by evaluating the anisothermal groundwater flow through a semi confining layer in the river therefore an analytical solution was derived in an aquifer system of thickness l arriaga and leap 2006 3 t t 0 z 0 4 t t l z l thus the general differential eq 2 was simplified to eq 5 5 t t 0 t l t 0 e β z l 1 e β 1 6 β c f ρ f q l k fs where t temperature at any depth t 0 measured uppermost temperature t l measured lowermost temperature l vertical distance between measured uppermost and lowermost temperatures β is a dimensionless parameter and a positive or negative value of β is determined by the downward or upward value of q respectively β 0 indicates no vertical flow in the hyporheic zone a computer program developed by boyle and saleem 1979 was used to obtain the sum of deviations between the left and right sides of eq 5 the sum of deviation f β is as follows 7 f β z 0 z l t t 0 t l t 0 e β z l 1 e β 1 2 the temperatures of the five sediment layers were inputted into eq 7 to obtain the optimum value of β when the value of the sum of deviation was minimized in addition the downwelling or upwelling fluxes can be obtained by the one dimensional heat transport model eq 8 the physical parameters that are inputted into eq 8 are shown in table 1 8 q k fs β c f ρ f l positive or negative value of q indicates downwelling and upwelling respectively and the value of q indicates magnitudes of hyporheic water exchange 3 3 sediment sampling and particle size analysis at each test point a 160 cm pvc pipe was inserted into the riverbed next to the temperature pipe the length of a pipe at the sediment water interface was approximately 45 cm to obtain 45 cm sediment samples the top of the pipe was plugged before pulling out the pvc pipe from the riverbed to isolate the interior of the pvc pipe from the atmosphere then the sediment sample that was removed from the pvc pipe was placed into a sampling bag for particle size analysis moreover the sediment samples were air dried in the laboratory and the air dried sediment samples were categorized into 15 grades based on particle sizes using an automatic sieving machine the largest sieve size was 5 mm and the smallest sieve size was 0 075 mm the median grain size d50 that denotes effective sediment particle size diameter at 50 cumulative weight percentage of particle size was determined by the grain size cumulative curves of each test points meanwhile the grain size can be classified into three groups gravel grain size 2 0 mm sand 0 075 mm grain size 2 0 mm and silt clay grain size 0 075 mm song et al 2016 3 4 riverbed topography and surface water and groundwater level measurements the locations and elevations of terrain points were measured by gps rtk global positioning system real time kinematic technology using a trimble r8 mobile receiver manufactured by american trimble a digital elevation model of the river confluence was constructed in arcgis using a kriging interpolation algorithm the obtuse junction angle at the river confluence was measured by the average thalweg path along the branches meanwhile the groundwater and surface water level data in the test area from 9 to 13 july 2016 the groundwater level obtained in a monitoring well situated 200 m off the test area as well as the surface water level at the test site was monitored every day by the same equipment 4 results 4 1 riverbed morphological characteristics and sediment particle distributions the planform geometry of the river confluence was y shaped with a branch into a meandering channel fig 2 a in the test area the avalanche faces were observed at the mouths of the two channels and the scour hole in the central zone near the avalanche face where the two flows mixed extended to a depth of approximately 1 5 m approximately three times the upstream average channel depths fig 2b an in stream gravel bar with a large sediment grain size was observed in the center of the postconfluence channel in the nearby zone of point 19pm 19pm indicates point 19 in pm channel fig 2b the greater water depth and thalweg path occurred in the zone near the left bank of the t channel in the downstream of the river confluence the pm channel the topography condition was relatively complex due to the mixing of two flows in the cross section including point 15pm 16pm and 17pm and the cross section including point 18pm 19pm and 20pm the thalweg path nears the left bank because of a flux momentum ratio 0 5 and the thalweg path in the center zone of the last cross section along the flow direction in the pm fig 2a in addition to evaluating the features of the riverbed morphology the depositional and erosional conditions were also observed in the field study in the test area the erosional zones located near the thalweg path were observed in the left bank of the t channel and the center of the downstream channel with less average cumulative percentages by clay weight 0 53 and 1 03 respectively table 2 particle size data were not obtained within the center of the m channel due to the limitation of water depth and equipment however the sediment particle size distributions indicated that the right and left banks of the m channel were depositional zones within the confluence both sides of the m channel had a higher average cumulative weight percentage of clay or silt and a lower value of d50 than the other channels the average cumulative weight percentages of clay or silt were 19 56 and 15 46 in the right and left banks of the m channel respectively table 2 4 2 general hydraulic characteristics the main hydraulic parameters were obtained in the field study during the test period table 3 the mean flow velocity of the m channel was the largest mean flow velocity is 2 04 m s within the river confluence compared to that in the t and pm channels meanwhile the greatest flow velocity was also observed in the m channel table 3 the mean flow velocities of the t and pm channels were 1 48 m s and 1 03 m s respectively table 3 the flow dynamics based on the velocities and directions as well as the riverbed topography are shown in fig 3 the sites of helicoidal arrows indicate the locations of helicoidal flow cells formed by the confluence of two rivers fig 3 meanwhile the riverbed topography was also controlled by the flow dynamics and the central scour zone was formed by the erosional stress of the downward flow a shear layer the imaginary line in fig 3 was observed in the middle of the helicoidal cells which also formed by the confluence of the two flows the location of the shear layer was also determined by the planform of the river confluence and flow momentum ratio the y shaped confluence and the lesser flow momentum ratio m 0 5 resulted in the shear layer in the area south central of the junction the formation of flow stagnation zones in the lee of each avalanche face also induced the occurrence of deposition zones in the same location meanwhile in the lee of the helicoidal flow cell zone the flow separation zone was observed with the river water that flows to both sides of the pm channel entrance leite ribeiro et al 2012 a flow recovery zone is located in the m channel near the third cross section by the flow direction fig 3 4 3 patterns and magnitudes of hyporheic water exchange the temperature data beneath the sediment water interface were obtained during the test period the patterns and magnitudes of the hyporheic water exchange were determined by the one dimensional heat transport model based on the estimated temperature distributions of each test point the values of the hyporheic water exchange ranged from 243 91 mm d to 14 71 mm d and the negative and positive values indicated upwelling and downwelling at the test point respectively additionally the magnitudes of the water exchange at these 20 test points were negative which indicated that the upwelling flow dominated the test area during the test period therefore downwelling was observed at test points 1 t and 2 t of the t channel and test point 14pm fig 4 for the magnitudes of the hyporheic water exchange large flux variabilities were measured in the river confluence fig 5 the range of the hyporheic water exchange fluxes for the entire river confluence was from 315 83 mm d to 14 71 mm d the largest variability of the water exchange fluxes was observed in the pm channel where more complex riverbed morphology occurred from 10 74 mm d to 315 83 mm d and the minimum variability was observed in the m channel from 2 81 mm d to 14 71 mm d fig 5 the mean of the hyporheic water exchange magnitudes of the pm channel m channel and t channel were 109 36 mm d 23 18 mm d and 82 91 mm d respectively fig 5 the upwelling and downwelling occurred simultaneously in the t and m channels and only upwelling occurred in the pm channel the magnitudes of the three downwelling test points were generally lower which indicated that the downwelling process was relatively weak compared to the upwelling in the test area a strong upwelling zone was observed in the left bank of the t channel and the center and left banks of the pm channel the mean values of the upwelling fluxes in the three zones were 178 14 mm d 148 33 mm d and 122 55 mm d respectively fig 6 the hyporheic water exchange process was weak whether upwelling and downwelling at the right or left bank within the m channel although the data of the hyporheic water exchange flux were not obtained due to the limitation of the large water depth and streambed materials in the center of the m channel notably the largest absolute upwelling flux value was observed at test point 19pm 315 83 mm d where a large gravel bar was formed fig 2 and stronger downwelling occurred at test point 14pm fig 6 5 discussion the patterns and magnitudes of hyporheic water exchange are significantly impacted by the topography of the riverbed kasahara and wondzell 2003 the primary pattern of the hyporheic water exchange is determined by the groundwater and surface water levels at the regional scale the groundwater and surface water level data in the test area from 9 to 13 july 2016 indicated that the groundwater level stabilized at approximately 422 90 m and the surface water level was approximately 422 30 m during the entire test period in locations where the groundwater level was higher than the surface water level groundwater discharge into the surface water through the hyporheic zone on a regional scale commonly occurred wang et al 2018 regionally the upwelling hyporheic water exchange may be induced by groundwater discharged into the river hyun et al 2011 however different patterns were caused by the complicated topography of riverbed areas at the meter scale song et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 in the field study the downwelling process was observed at test point 1 t and test point 2 t notably based on the investigation of the elevation a deflection of the thalweg was found in the zone nearby test point 1 t and test point 2 t fig 2 portions of the surface water enter the hyporheic zone when occurs flow through the zone due to the barrier of the higher sediment furthermore the weak downwelling resulted from this hyporheic flow harvey and bencala 1993 kasahara and wondzell 2003 the downwelling was also observed at test point 14pm which was located in the zone of the helicoidal flow cells the downwelling flow in the zone of the helicoidal flow cells may be caused by the occurrence and impact of the two flows szupiany et al 2009 according to the analysis of best 1988 in the zone of the helicoidal flow cells the direction of the flow translates downward due to the encounter and impact of the two flows furthermore the downward flow caused the surface water to enter the hyporheic zone and form downwelling notably the stronger momentum of the flow in the m channel caused by a large discharge and flow velocity may have resulted in a stronger downwelling process at test point 14pm than the downwelling at test point 1 and test point 2 meanwhile cardenas et al 2004 suggested that the cross stream pressure gradients along meanders also increased in the downwelling flux in the confluent meander bend channel furthermore the different patterns may cause the adsorption and release of contaminants within the hyporheic zone briggs et al 2014 previous studies suggested that sediment particle distributions caused by erosional and depositional processes controlled by the obtuse junction angle 115 and lower momentum flux ratio m 0 5 of the river confluence have significant effects on the magnitudes of hyporheic water exchange whether upwelling and downwelling kenworthy and rhoads 1995 song et al 2016 wang et al 2018 however large spatial variability of the sediment particle distributions was found in different zones of the three channels fig 7 notably lesser upwelling fluxes were generally observed in the depositional zone determined by the riverbed morphological and general hydraulic characteristics as well as the sediment particle distributions the depositional zone included test points 4 t 7 t 10 m 12 m 11 m 13 m and 15pm and with upwelling the mean value of the upwelling fluxes was 37 18 mm d in the nearby zone of the thalweg including test points 3 t 5 t 6 t 9 t 17pm 19pm 20pm and 22pm the upwelling fluxes were generally higher at these test points in addition the phenomena were closely linked to the sediment particle distributions of the test points a favorable correlation between the absolute value of upwelling fluxes and the d50 of test points was found by pearson bivariate correlation analysis r 0 526 p 0 017 indicating the larger upwelling flux generally occurred at the test point with a large d50 value in the field study the d50 values have significant positive and negative correlations with the weight percentage of the gravel and clay at each test point r1 0 715 p1 0 000 r2 0 463 p2 0 026 song et al 2016 suggested that a large amount of clay and less gravel may result in lower vertical hydraulic conductivity further hindering the hyporheic water exchange the largest upwelling magnitude occurred at test point 19pm where a large gravel bar with larger sediment particle size formed which enhanced the process of upwelling in addition according to the analysis of zhou et al 2013 surface water generally enters into to in stream gravel bar at the front of the bar and discharges behind the bar a portion of hyporheic flow may enhance the upwelling process at test point 19pm which is behind the bar fox et al 2018 6 conclusions the topographic characteristics of the river confluence were evaluated during the test period whereas the general hydraulic characteristics and sediment particle distributions affected by the topography were investigated in a field study additionally the patterns and magnitudes of hyporheic water exchange were estimated by the one dimensional heat transport modal at each test point based on the flow dynamics and sediment particle distributions induced by the riverbed topography characteristics a deposition zone was observed in the right bank of the t channel and on both sides of the m channel and a large gravel bar formed in the zone near test point 19pm within the pm channel erosional zones generally occurred in the vicinity of the thalweg and the magnitude of hyporheic water exchange was significantly affected by the sediment particle distributions resulting from erosional and depositional processes upwelling dominated the test area and a weak downwelling process occurred at three of 23 total test points the predominant pattern of water exchange was determined by the level of the surface water and groundwater at the regional scale however a complicated riverbed topography may cause different water exchange patterns at the meter scale such as the deflection of the thalweg and helicoidal flow in the center of confluence which cause downwelling and groundwater recharge by river water therefore this study can provide a scientific reference for a clearer understanding of small scale variability in hyporheic water exchange affected by riverbed morphology the finding of the study could be useful to the management of water quantity and quality in this area and other similar areas nonetheless potential limitations may cause by the short time testing in further study long term testing will be encouraged to improve understanding of hyporheic water exchange processes and dynamics declaration of interest none acknowledgements this study was jointly supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant nos 51679200 and 51379175

6421,river confluences are pivotal junctions that have vital influences on hydraulic characteristics and sediment particle distributions as well as on hyporheic water exchange however hyporheic water exchange is poorly understood because of the complicated river morphology within a river confluence therefore the river confluence between the juehe river and haohe river located in arid and semi arid areas of northwestern china was selected to evaluate the hyporheic water exchange processes and the temperatures of different depth sediment were measured on july 11th and 12th 2016 by an instrument equipped with five temperature sensors the patterns and magnitudes of hyporheic water exchange were estimated using a one dimensional heat transport model coupled with temperature data meanwhile terrain points elevations and sediment particle distributions in this river confluence were collected to determine the confluence riverbed morphology furthermore the river confluence morphology effects on hyporheic water exchange were investigated in this study the different riverbed morphology and hydrodynamic zone locations were observed which were controlled by the planform geometry with low river confluence flux momentum during the test period meanwhile the upwelling flow dominated in the test area and the downwelling occurred at three of the 23 total test points which was induced by the complicated riverbed morphology and hydraulic characteristics additionally the magnitudes of the upwelling flow were significantly influenced by the sediment heterogeneity subjected to the erosional and depositional processes hyporheic water exchange is a vital hydrological process in arid and semi arid areas where it significantly impacts the ecological environment of rivers this study provides a valuable guideline for water quality and quantity management in arid and semi arid areas keywords river confluence morphology hydraulic characteristics sedimentary properties hyporheic water exchange 1 introduction rivers are a typical geomorphic feature on the earth s land surface with a variety of environmental and service functions surface water and groundwater are not independent hydrological systems boulton et al 1998 chen et al 2017b surface groundwater exchange commonly occurs in the hyporheic zone of rivers jones and holmes 1996 the hyporheic zone is the sediment layer within the riverbed that is saturated with water and is located in the intermediate zone between surface water and groundwater which is the zone that connects rivers and groundwater systems boulton et al 1998 zarnetske et al 2012 cranswick et al 2014 hyporheic water exchange drives the physical chemical and biological characteristics of the hyporheic zone controls interaction between the surface water and groundwater brunke and gonser 1997 and further influences the quality and quantity of surface water and groundwater kalbus et al 2007 chen et al 2018 meanwhile the hyporheic zone is regarded as the liver of the river due to biodegradation and adsorption of pollutants within river systems storey et al 2004 fischer et al 2005 briggs et al 2014 hence research on hyporheic water exchange has gradually attracted the attention of researchers and has become vital in international studies krause et al 2009 furthermore in arid and semi arid regions hyporheic water exchange is an extremely important hydrologic process that has significant effects on the water quality and quantity of rivers due to the reduced precipitation rainfall capacity wang et al 2008 2013 chen et al 2017a the accurate estimation of hyporheic water exchange patterns and magnitudes is an essential task in the research of water exchange in previous studies many methods were used to determine the patterns and magnitudes of hyporheic water exchange including tracer tests yang et al 2012 the darcy equation anderson 2005 thermal methods hatch et al 2006 seepage meters zhu et al 2015 and other methods wei et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 however different measurement scales and hydrogeological conditions limit the application of these methods in field studies for example tracer tests and baseflow separation determine ground surface water exchange at the catchment scale hatch et al 2006 and a seepage meter is generally used to assess riverbed seepage within relatively smooth riverbeds zhu et al 2015 heat has been increasingly used to estimate the hyporheic water exchange patterns and magnitudes because heat is a valid natural tracer that can be used on multiple scales anderson 2005 hatch et al 2006 remarkably collecting and measuring temperature data in the hyporheic zone is simple and convenient in many field studies stallman 1965 developed a one dimensional heat transport model that estimated hyporheic water exchange processes based on the theory that hyporheic water flow occurs simultaneously with heat transfer bredehoeft and papaopulos 1965 proposed a one dimensional steady state heat model based on the steady state thermal assumption furthermore the model was developed by anibas et al 2009 to evaluate the hyporheic water exchange patterns and magnitudes on various stream topographies engelhardt et al 2011 collected temperature data to study groundwater surface water interactions in schwarzbach germany by the model wang et al 2018 measured riverbed temperatures and sampled riverbed sediment in the weihe river to estimate hyporheic water exchange and further analyze the effect of water exchange on inorganic nitrogen within pore water the topography of the river bank or riverbed has a significant influence on hyporheic water exchange kasahara and wondzell 2003 hill et al 1998 found that changes in longitudinal gradients in stream channel riffle pool units induced small scale vertical and horizontal hyporheic water exchanges meanwhile boano et al 2006 indicated that the process of surface groundwater exchange in river bends is more significant relative to that in straight channels however deposition and erosion caused by flow along river bends also influences the hyporheic flow through river sediment song et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 gravel bars are also a common topographic feature in a natural channel wondzell and swanson 1999 found that while lateral flow typically dominates gravel bars a large flood event created extensive hyporheic zones with increased downward flux at the head of several gravel bars while lateral downstream river bar interactions were maintained thus the patterns and magnitudes of hyporheic water exchange are easily induced by the river bank topography or riverbed forms such as riffle pools gravel bars and river bends boano et al 2006 shope et al 2012 stonedahl et al 2013 however the vast majority of studies have focused on the effects of relatively large geomorphological structures on hyporheic water exchange wondzell and swanson 1999 stonedahl et al 2013 under complex river topographic conditions small scale variability in hyporheic water exchange affected by river morphology at a river confluence is still not fully understood therefore estimating hyporheic water exchange and analyzing the influences of riverbed morphology on patterns and magnitudes of hyporheic water exchange not only provide a useful clue to understanding the hydrological processes but also provide a vital guide for the management of water quantity and quality in arid and semi arid regions a river confluence is an important morphological element in the river system the morphology of the river confluence commonly consists of an avalanche face confluence scour and separation zone bar best 1988 the avalanche face produced by severe flow deflection rapid growth rate and shear stress when the two streams entered the confluence is more pronounced at higher confluence angles confluence scour refers to the scouring ditch formed by the increase in velocity and turbulence level at the junction when the two streams merge the separation zone bar is located at the corner of the lower reaches which is formed by the lower fluid velocity and pressure when the sediment from the tributaries is involved in the separation area best 1986 best and rhoads 2008 all of these features of flow dynamics and sediment transport within the river confluence such as erosion and deposition processes are induced by the river confluence morphology boano et al 2006 furthermore the characteristics of flow dynamics and grain size distributions including silt clay as well as median grain size d50 significantly influence the hyporheic water exchange patterns and magnitudes song et al 2016 in this study the river confluence between juehe river and haohe river located in the arid and semi arid areas of northwestern china was selected to evaluate the hyporheic water exchange processes and the temperatures data of different sediment layers were measured on july 11 and 12 2016 and used to quantitatively estimate the patterns and magnitudes of hyporheic water exchange using the one dimensional steady state heat transport model meanwhile the river confluence morphology was measured and sediment was sampled in the field study the particle size of the sediment was analyzed in the laboratory the objectives of this study are to 1 investigate the morphological features of a river confluence 2 estimate the spatial variability of the magnitudes and patterns of hyporheic water exchange and 3 further explore the effects of river morphology and sediment grain size distribution on hyporheic water exchange in the test area 2 study area the study was conducted in the confluence of the juehe river main channel and haohe river tributary channel and was performed in xi an city shaanxi province china on july 11 and 12 2016 the juehe river is a secondary tributary of the weihe river in the guanzhong plain the juehe river total length and drainage area are 64 2 km and 687 km2 respectively the haohe river has a total length of 46 km and a drainage area of 292 km2 the haohe river flows into the juehe river near the xiangji temple in the southern portion of xi an city the two streams both originate from the tsinling mountains and finally flow into the weihe river the juehe river basin is located in an arid and semiarid climate zone with an average annual rainfall of approximately 660 mm guo et al 2018 the weather in the juehe river basin is hot and rainy in summer and cold and dry in winter song et al 2015 similar to most rivers in arid and semi arid areas juehe river presents active interactions between surface water and groundwater that significantly impact the heavy metal and nitrogen concentration of surface water and groundwater liu et al 2017 guo et al 2018 in addition the juehe and haohe rivers both located in the southern weihe river basin and near the tsinling mountains contain bed materials largely composed of coarse sand gravel and even cobbles which easily induces significant hyporheic water exchange meanwhile the two rivers are crucial for human health and economic consumption on the guanzhong plain in shaanxi province which includes xi an city zhi et al 2013 the test site is located in the confluence of the juehe and haohe rivers which is in the southern portion of xi an city fig 1 a field measurements were conducted and a total of 23 test points were established in the confluence fig 1b nine test points were established in the tributary channel t five test points were established in the main channel m and another nine test points were established in the postconfluence main channel pm each transect included 2 or 3 test points with 10 15 m spacing based on morphological features observed during field measurements in addition no test point was established in the center of the confluence due to equipment length limitations from july 9 to 13 2016 rainfall events did not occur and the groundwater level and river level were stabilized in test area which was important for avoiding the influence of climatic conditions on hyporheic water exchange 3 method 3 1 sediment temperature measurements during the test period temperature data of specific depth sediment layers at the 23 test points were collected by a 2 0 m instrument equipped with 5 temperature sensors at specific depths 0 0 m 0 1 m 0 2 m 0 3 m and 0 45 m fig 1c the lower part of the instrument was marked with a length scale to insert the instrument into the sediment at a depth of 0 45 m five temperature sensors were used to collect specific depth sediment layer temperature data the temperature sensors in different sediment layers began working after the instrument was inserted into the river sediment a measurement required approximately 30 min for the temperature sensors to reach thermal steady state conditions the instrument also consists of a data logger that can continuously record and store temperature data of the five sensors fig 1c the instrument with an accuracy of 0 05 c was calibrated to obtain accurate temperature data after each measurement then the measured temperature data and other physical parameters were input to a one dimensional heat transport model provided by bredehoeft and papaopulos 1965 to obtain the hyporheic water exchange patterns and magnitudes 3 2 one dimensional heat transport model heat is a vital natural tracer in the determination of hyporheic water exchange patterns and magnitudes anibas et al 2009 stallman 1965 developed the following equation to estimated patterns and magnitudes of

components of fluid velocity in the x y and z directions x y z cartesian coordinates t time the expression v x v y 0 is based on the assumption that hyporheic water exchange is one dimensional in the

were very small over time by evaluating the anisothermal groundwater flow through a semi confining layer in the river therefore an analytical solution was derived in an aquifer system of thickness l arriaga and leap 2006 3 t t 0 z 0 4 t t l z l thus the general differential eq 2 was simplified to eq 5 5 t t 0 t l t 0 e β z l 1 e β 1 6 β c f ρ f q l k fs where t temperature at any depth t 0 measured uppermost temperature t l measured lowermost temperature l vertical distance between measured uppermost and lowermost temperatures β is a dimensionless parameter and a positive or negative value of β is determined by the downward or upward value of q respectively β 0 indicates no vertical flow in the hyporheic zone a computer program developed by boyle and saleem 1979 was used to obtain the sum of deviations between the left and right sides of eq 5 the sum of deviation f β is as follows 7 f β z 0 z l t t 0 t l t 0 e β z l 1 e β 1 2 the temperatures of the five sediment layers were inputted into eq 7 to obtain the optimum value of β when the value of the sum of deviation was minimized in addition the downwelling or upwelling fluxes can be obtained by the one dimensional heat transport model eq 8 the physical parameters that are inputted into eq 8 are shown in table 1 8 q k fs β c f ρ f l positive or negative value of q indicates downwelling and upwelling respectively and the value of q indicates magnitudes of hyporheic water exchange 3 3 sediment sampling and particle size analysis at each test point a 160 cm pvc pipe was inserted into the riverbed next to the temperature pipe the length of a pipe at the sediment water interface was approximately 45 cm to obtain 45 cm sediment samples the top of the pipe was plugged before pulling out the pvc pipe from the riverbed to isolate the interior of the pvc pipe from the atmosphere then the sediment sample that was removed from the pvc pipe was placed into a sampling bag for particle size analysis moreover the sediment samples were air dried in the laboratory and the air dried sediment samples were categorized into 15 grades based on particle sizes using an automatic sieving machine the largest sieve size was 5 mm and the smallest sieve size was 0 075 mm the median grain size d50 that denotes effective sediment particle size diameter at 50 cumulative weight percentage of particle size was determined by the grain size cumulative curves of each test points meanwhile the grain size can be classified into three groups gravel grain size 2 0 mm sand 0 075 mm grain size 2 0 mm and silt clay grain size 0 075 mm song et al 2016 3 4 riverbed topography and surface water and groundwater level measurements the locations and elevations of terrain points were measured by gps rtk global positioning system real time kinematic technology using a trimble r8 mobile receiver manufactured by american trimble a digital elevation model of the river confluence was constructed in arcgis using a kriging interpolation algorithm the obtuse junction angle at the river confluence was measured by the average thalweg path along the branches meanwhile the groundwater and surface water level data in the test area from 9 to 13 july 2016 the groundwater level obtained in a monitoring well situated 200 m off the test area as well as the surface water level at the test site was monitored every day by the same equipment 4 results 4 1 riverbed morphological characteristics and sediment particle distributions the planform geometry of the river confluence was y shaped with a branch into a meandering channel fig 2 a in the test area the avalanche faces were observed at the mouths of the two channels and the scour hole in the central zone near the avalanche face where the two flows mixed extended to a depth of approximately 1 5 m approximately three times the upstream average channel depths fig 2b an in stream gravel bar with a large sediment grain size was observed in the center of the postconfluence channel in the nearby zone of point 19pm 19pm indicates point 19 in pm channel fig 2b the greater water depth and thalweg path occurred in the zone near the left bank of the t channel in the downstream of the river confluence the pm channel the topography condition was relatively complex due to the mixing of two flows in the cross section including point 15pm 16pm and 17pm and the cross section including point 18pm 19pm and 20pm the thalweg path nears the left bank because of a flux momentum ratio 0 5 and the thalweg path in the center zone of the last cross section along the flow direction in the pm fig 2a in addition to evaluating the features of the riverbed morphology the depositional and erosional conditions were also observed in the field study in the test area the erosional zones located near the thalweg path were observed in the left bank of the t channel and the center of the downstream channel with less average cumulative percentages by clay weight 0 53 and 1 03 respectively table 2 particle size data were not obtained within the center of the m channel due to the limitation of water depth and equipment however the sediment particle size distributions indicated that the right and left banks of the m channel were depositional zones within the confluence both sides of the m channel had a higher average cumulative weight percentage of clay or silt and a lower value of d50 than the other channels the average cumulative weight percentages of clay or silt were 19 56 and 15 46 in the right and left banks of the m channel respectively table 2 4 2 general hydraulic characteristics the main hydraulic parameters were obtained in the field study during the test period table 3 the mean flow velocity of the m channel was the largest mean flow velocity is 2 04 m s within the river confluence compared to that in the t and pm channels meanwhile the greatest flow velocity was also observed in the m channel table 3 the mean flow velocities of the t and pm channels were 1 48 m s and 1 03 m s respectively table 3 the flow dynamics based on the velocities and directions as well as the riverbed topography are shown in fig 3 the sites of helicoidal arrows indicate the locations of helicoidal flow cells formed by the confluence of two rivers fig 3 meanwhile the riverbed topography was also controlled by the flow dynamics and the central scour zone was formed by the erosional stress of the downward flow a shear layer the imaginary line in fig 3 was observed in the middle of the helicoidal cells which also formed by the confluence of the two flows the location of the shear layer was also determined by the planform of the river confluence and flow momentum ratio the y shaped confluence and the lesser flow momentum ratio m 0 5 resulted in the shear layer in the area south central of the junction the formation of flow stagnation zones in the lee of each avalanche face also induced the occurrence of deposition zones in the same location meanwhile in the lee of the helicoidal flow cell zone the flow separation zone was observed with the river water that flows to both sides of the pm channel entrance leite ribeiro et al 2012 a flow recovery zone is located in the m channel near the third cross section by the flow direction fig 3 4 3 patterns and magnitudes of hyporheic water exchange the temperature data beneath the sediment water interface were obtained during the test period the patterns and magnitudes of the hyporheic water exchange were determined by the one dimensional heat transport model based on the estimated temperature distributions of each test point the values of the hyporheic water exchange ranged from 243 91 mm d to 14 71 mm d and the negative and positive values indicated upwelling and downwelling at the test point respectively additionally the magnitudes of the water exchange at these 20 test points were negative which indicated that the upwelling flow dominated the test area during the test period therefore downwelling was observed at test points 1 t and 2 t of the t channel and test point 14pm fig 4 for the magnitudes of the hyporheic water exchange large flux variabilities were measured in the river confluence fig 5 the range of the hyporheic water exchange fluxes for the entire river confluence was from 315 83 mm d to 14 71 mm d the largest variability of the water exchange fluxes was observed in the pm channel where more complex riverbed morphology occurred from 10 74 mm d to 315 83 mm d and the minimum variability was observed in the m channel from 2 81 mm d to 14 71 mm d fig 5 the mean of the hyporheic water exchange magnitudes of the pm channel m channel and t channel were 109 36 mm d 23 18 mm d and 82 91 mm d respectively fig 5 the upwelling and downwelling occurred simultaneously in the t and m channels and only upwelling occurred in the pm channel the magnitudes of the three downwelling test points were generally lower which indicated that the downwelling process was relatively weak compared to the upwelling in the test area a strong upwelling zone was observed in the left bank of the t channel and the center and left banks of the pm channel the mean values of the upwelling fluxes in the three zones were 178 14 mm d 148 33 mm d and 122 55 mm d respectively fig 6 the hyporheic water exchange process was weak whether upwelling and downwelling at the right or left bank within the m channel although the data of the hyporheic water exchange flux were not obtained due to the limitation of the large water depth and streambed materials in the center of the m channel notably the largest absolute upwelling flux value was observed at test point 19pm 315 83 mm d where a large gravel bar was formed fig 2 and stronger downwelling occurred at test point 14pm fig 6 5 discussion the patterns and magnitudes of hyporheic water exchange are significantly impacted by the topography of the riverbed kasahara and wondzell 2003 the primary pattern of the hyporheic water exchange is determined by the groundwater and surface water levels at the regional scale the groundwater and surface water level data in the test area from 9 to 13 july 2016 indicated that the groundwater level stabilized at approximately 422 90 m and the surface water level was approximately 422 30 m during the entire test period in locations where the groundwater level was higher than the surface water level groundwater discharge into the surface water through the hyporheic zone on a regional scale commonly occurred wang et al 2018 regionally the upwelling hyporheic water exchange may be induced by groundwater discharged into the river hyun et al 2011 however different patterns were caused by the complicated topography of riverbed areas at the meter scale song et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 in the field study the downwelling process was observed at test point 1 t and test point 2 t notably based on the investigation of the elevation a deflection of the thalweg was found in the zone nearby test point 1 t and test point 2 t fig 2 portions of the surface water enter the hyporheic zone when occurs flow through the zone due to the barrier of the higher sediment furthermore the weak downwelling resulted from this hyporheic flow harvey and bencala 1993 kasahara and wondzell 2003 the downwelling was also observed at test point 14pm which was located in the zone of the helicoidal flow cells the downwelling flow in the zone of the helicoidal flow cells may be caused by the occurrence and impact of the two flows szupiany et al 2009 according to the analysis of best 1988 in the zone of the helicoidal flow cells the direction of the flow translates downward due to the encounter and impact of the two flows furthermore the downward flow caused the surface water to enter the hyporheic zone and form downwelling notably the stronger momentum of the flow in the m channel caused by a large discharge and flow velocity may have resulted in a stronger downwelling process at test point 14pm than the downwelling at test point 1 and test point 2 meanwhile cardenas et al 2004 suggested that the cross stream pressure gradients along meanders also increased in the downwelling flux in the confluent meander bend channel furthermore the different patterns may cause the adsorption and release of contaminants within the hyporheic zone briggs et al 2014 previous studies suggested that sediment particle distributions caused by erosional and depositional processes controlled by the obtuse junction angle 115 and lower momentum flux ratio m 0 5 of the river confluence have significant effects on the magnitudes of hyporheic water exchange whether upwelling and downwelling kenworthy and rhoads 1995 song et al 2016 wang et al 2018 however large spatial variability of the sediment particle distributions was found in different zones of the three channels fig 7 notably lesser upwelling fluxes were generally observed in the depositional zone determined by the riverbed morphological and general hydraulic characteristics as well as the sediment particle distributions the depositional zone included test points 4 t 7 t 10 m 12 m 11 m 13 m and 15pm and with upwelling the mean value of the upwelling fluxes was 37 18 mm d in the nearby zone of the thalweg including test points 3 t 5 t 6 t 9 t 17pm 19pm 20pm and 22pm the upwelling fluxes were generally higher at these test points in addition the phenomena were closely linked to the sediment particle distributions of the test points a favorable correlation between the absolute value of upwelling fluxes and the d50 of test points was found by pearson bivariate correlation analysis r 0 526 p 0 017 indicating the larger upwelling flux generally occurred at the test point with a large d50 value in the field study the d50 values have significant positive and negative correlations with the weight percentage of the gravel and clay at each test point r1 0 715 p1 0 000 r2 0 463 p2 0 026 song et al 2016 suggested that a large amount of clay and less gravel may result in lower vertical hydraulic conductivity further hindering the hyporheic water exchange the largest upwelling magnitude occurred at test point 19pm where a large gravel bar with larger sediment particle size formed which enhanced the process of upwelling in addition according to the analysis of zhou et al 2013 surface water generally enters into to in stream gravel bar at the front of the bar and discharges behind the bar a portion of hyporheic flow may enhance the upwelling process at test point 19pm which is behind the bar fox et al 2018 6 conclusions the topographic characteristics of the river confluence were evaluated during the test period whereas the general hydraulic characteristics and sediment particle distributions affected by the topography were investigated in a field study additionally the patterns and magnitudes of hyporheic water exchange were estimated by the one dimensional heat transport modal at each test point based on the flow dynamics and sediment particle distributions induced by the riverbed topography characteristics a deposition zone was observed in the right bank of the t channel and on both sides of the m channel and a large gravel bar formed in the zone near test point 19pm within the pm channel erosional zones generally occurred in the vicinity of the thalweg and the magnitude of hyporheic water exchange was significantly affected by the sediment particle distributions resulting from erosional and depositional processes upwelling dominated the test area and a weak downwelling process occurred at three of 23 total test points the predominant pattern of water exchange was determined by the level of the surface water and groundwater at the regional scale however a complicated riverbed topography may cause different water exchange patterns at the meter scale such as the deflection of the thalweg and helicoidal flow in the center of confluence which cause downwelling and groundwater recharge by river water therefore this study can provide a scientific reference for a clearer understanding of small scale variability in hyporheic water exchange affected by riverbed morphology the finding of the study could be useful to the management of water quantity and quality in this area and other similar areas nonetheless potential limitations may cause by the short time testing in further study long term testing will be encouraged to improve understanding of hyporheic water exchange processes and dynamics declaration of interest none acknowledgements this study was jointly supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant nos 51679200 and 51379175

6422,at present increasing requirements for both the efficiency and environmental sustainability of resources demand more knowledge about the feasibility of the implementation of innovative technologies both in a large scale as well as in the long run even at modified sewage flows and characterizations water infrastructures must always remain reliable to guarantee sustainable urban water management dimensioning methods and assessment variables must be adapted to achieve more flexible systems in the long term this paper aims to assess the actual impact of the implementation of new alternative sanitation systems nass as well as stormwater decentralization measures in an existing sewage disposal system with means of a dynamic simulation within a 50 year time interval in 10 years steps two scenario simulations showed that the implementation of the module for blackwater and greywater separation with an assumed pollutant fractionation represents the investigated sustainable sanitation measures reliably results showed a decrease in the overflow discharge loads and duration of the control stormwater infrastructures the wwtp showed a successful chemical oxygen demand cod and total nitrogen elimination tn in all cases nonetheless operational flexibility is fundamental in order to cope with the more unfavorable cod tn ratios of the wwtp inflow after full implementation

incompatibility between the design concept of its infrastructures for long lifespans and the hardly predictable factors which influence their operation in germany areas with low population density have been coping with some core challenges over the years such as demographic decline climate change and stricter discharge standards therefore it is necessary to deeply understand how the different water and wastewater subsystems interact with one another at present increasing requirements for both the resource efficiency and environmental sustainability demand more knowledge about the feasibility of implementation of such technologies in a large scale as well as in the long run nonetheless rural areas have not been extensively investigated using detailed modeling thus far since the challenges mentioned above would result in a slightly different implementation approach as that of urban conglomerates a thorough understanding of the temporal behavior of wastewater systems can be acquired using an integrated model by applying integrated dynamic modeling it is possible to assess the effects of a stepwise implementation of new alternative sanitation systems nass and methods for stormwater decentralization in this matter various studies have focused on decision support solutions for water supply and wastewater discharge concepts as well as on optimization of operating strategies cf kaufmann alves 2013 bach et al 2014 schmitt et al 2014 schütze and alex 2014 furthermore some well known assessments of new sanitation concepts based on integrated dynamic simulation have been developed for urban scenarios cf refsgaard et al 2007 freni et al 2009 rodríguez et al 2009 benetto et al 2009 qin et al 2011 gamerith et al 2012 penn et al 2013 urich and rauch 2014 thus a simplified procedure of wastewater separation into blackwater and greywater bw gw is modeled as a component of the sewer network to assess the long term operation and reliability of an existing wastewater plant wwtp under the timely implementation of various nass measures moreover stormwater decentralization measures are implemented with the concepts mentioned above hence the aim of this paper is the application of a straightforward concept for dynamic modeling to analyze the detailed behavior of the material flows in the sewer as well as to monitor their influence on the centralized wwtp and combined sewer overflow structures cso 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this paper aims to depict a straightforward approach for the integrative simulation therefore it is essential to carry out a detailed outline of the subsystems in question the wwtp catchment area covers 541 hectares ha and is located within the joint municipality enkenbach alsenborn in southwest germany cf fig 1 the study area has an average paved area ratio of 42 and a total population of approx 12 600 inhabitants inh distributed in seven municipalities subcatchments sc with varying socio economical features within the context of a rural region the sewer system operates for the most part as a combined system the daily specific domestic wastewater flow for this region is assumed to be 113 l inh d cf baron 2018 table 1 shows some characteristic values of the catchment area the total retention volume of the csos is approximate to 3000 m3 including the equalization tank at the wwtp inlet the combined sewage overflow discharges into the river alsenz relatively near the source and a few additional contributing streams fig 2 shows the layout of the studied subcatchments and the overflow structures as they are implemented in the model cf 2 2 the average inflow rate under dry weather conditions into the wastewater treatment plant wwtp amounts 31 l s while the designed maximal inflow rate allows as much as 141 l s the facility was designed for a biological oxygen demand bod5 capacity of 21 000 population equivalents pe at present the bod5 load at the wwtp inlet amounts 11 100 pebod5 fig 3 shows a layout of the facility under study the facility also has two units of primary clarifiers with a total volume vtot of 288 m3 the biological treatment takes place as simultaneous nitrification denitrification using two plug flow reactors vtot 4120 m3 with an upstream bio p reactor volume 805 m3 moreover it has two units of secondary clarifiers vtot 2063 m3 as well as an anaerobic digester for sludge stabilization v 1000 m3 table 2 shows some properties of the activated sludge at the facility 2 2 model set up a data model was laid out using the software simba version 2 1 cf alex et al 2015 the modeling approach for the sewer network and the wwtp is an integrative one the structure of the integrated model follows the recommendations of the central european simulation research group cf muschalla et al 2009 within the subcatchments the model influent represents the pollutants as well as the runoff volume for the surface runoff calculation the applied rainfall runoff approach requires rain data in mm 5 min as well as a description of pervious and impervious area of every subcatchment for the runoff calculation various types of losses are considered wetting and depression losses for impervious areas as well as wetting and infiltration losses for pervious areas the calculation of surface runoff is based on the approach of verworn and kenter 1993 a series of linear reservoirs nash cascades describe the sewer network hydraulics of the system finally the calculated runoff flows together with the dry weather flow within pipelines which are defined by constant flow times in this model the parameters i e chemical oxygen demand cod total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn and total phosphorus tp describe the wastewater composition at the outlet of the modules that represent the different wastewater subsystems cf 2 3 the pollutants are fractionated according to the activated sludge model asm3 cf ahnert et al 2015 alex et al 2015 gujer et al 1999 while the runoff volume remains as in the model influent the behavior of the three fractions within the model named influent as well as the 13 fractions described by the asm3 model can be assessed on every stage of the modeled wwtp system as well as at any time of the simulated time interval an assumed flow pattern depicts the diurnal variations of the dry weather flow rate and pollutant s concentration this diurnal flow pattern was validated using water consumption data provided by the municipal utilities as well as operation logs from the wwtp a detailed description of the mathematical approach can be found in the user s manual of simba all municipalities are depicted in the model by one single subcatchment the stormwater control structures are also described as one single structure per subcatchment however the volume of each modeled structure represents the sum of the storage volume of all structures within the municipality the wwtp model includes the primary and secondary treatments as well as a simplified sludge treatment the baseline model approach is shown in fig 4 this model was verified under dry weather conditions using the data of the operation logs from the years 2010 to 2013 flow rates 2 h composite concentrations as well as loads in kg per day for cod ammonium and ammonia nitrogen nhx n and nitrite and nitrate nitrogen nox n at the inlet and outlet were compared to the simulations of a 7 day diurnal flow pattern moreover parameters such as suspended solids and concentration in the biological reactor as well as at the inlet of the digester tank were also taken into account for the verification step the validation of the model resulted from comparing the operation log data from the years 2014 and 2015 for all weather conditions with the simulations under the corresponding logged weather data for the same years the model parameters were adjusted until achieving a simulated wwtp performance between the intervals logged data further details on the two methodic steps are not part of the scope of this paper 2 3 implementation of decentralization nass measures the modeling concept for the software implementation of the nass as well as the run off decoupling measures for long term integrative simulations is represented through modules within the model which are depicted in fig 5 as red boxes the implemented transformation strategies for run off decoupling and nass within the development of the transformation paths were carefully programmed within the model according to the specified concepts outlined in baron et al 2017 baron 2018 2 3 1 stormwater decoupling measures the following three different run off decoupling measures strive for run off reduction roof greening the run off volume from the green roofs flows into the combined sewer together with the remaining stormwater flow de sealing likewise the run off from the de sealed surfaces runs into the combined sewer swale infiltration for this measure the resulting run off volume is completely decoupled from the sewer system table 3 summarizes the set up of the two defining features for the implementation of the measures mentioned above the maximum percentage of the paved area as well as the assumed run off coefficient which are implemented in varying proportions for every municipality 2 3 2 material flow separation a source separation module was applied to represent the wastewater and material flow separation the considered parameters of the module are based on the values recommended by dwa 2014 the separation module can emulate the source separation according to the extent shown in table 4 furthermore fig 6 shows the time dependent behavior of the cod load and flow rate resulting from the simulation with the bw gw separation module under dry weather conditions in a selected municipality the following outflows can be generated according to the selected settings within the module material flow separation wastewater flow the greywater and blackwater flow together into the sewer e g baseline scenario co fermentation the blackwater is drained out with additional pressure pipelines into the digestion tank at the wwtp for co fermentation greywater to wastewater treatment plant the greywater flows into the combined sewer and is treated at the wwtp greywater recycling the greywater is reused within the settlement after proper treatment and finally flows into the combined sewer this implementation leads to a reduction in drinking water consumption up to 40 cf baron et al 2017 the greywater treatment was not considered as part of this study greywater to constructed wetland for this measure a black box approach was assumed i e the operation of the constructed wetland was not modeled within the scope of this study and therefore the wastewater treatment processes within this infrastructure were not further considered hence the greywater flow at issue is decoupled from the sewer system 2 3 3 fractionation of flow components although only a few studies have been carried out directly correlating the fractionation of the parameter cod for greywater and blackwater to the composition of the total sewage water a fractionation for both material flows was assumed based on the literature data evaluation by tolksdorf 2018 the particulate content of cod in blackwater was considered to be approximately 50 60 and in greywater 30 cf tolksdorf 2018 cod biodegradability was also assumed from values stated in tolksdorf 2018 the values for blackwater indicate a degradable cod content between 79 and 95 and for greywater between 82 and 94 and depending on various concepts regarding source separation fig 7 summarizes the assumed fractionation for blackwater and greywater within the source separation module in this regard a sensitivity analysis for cod fractionation regarding nass measures was conducted with the aim of assessing the plausibility of the assumed fractionation an essential part of this assessment is a coherent fractionation of the blackwater and greywater as two separated flows only a proper bw gw separation can satisfy the same fundamental principles of the asm3 model fig 8 shows the results of balancing the pollutant loads at wwtp inlet for a 7 day simulation run under dry weather conditions according to the following two approaches fractionation for baseline scenario complies with the asm3 fractionation for a combined sewer this case consists of a 7 day simulation run with wastewater flow qww the qww comprises the domestic wastewater flow qd plus the extraneous flow qf cf 1 1 q ww wwtp inlet q d q f bw gw fractionation in this case similarly a 7 day simulation run also takes place but with flow separation at the source for all modeled settlements using the assumed fractionation approach cf fig 7 a subsequent re mixing of the separated flows allowed a proper comparison with fractionation of the baseline scenario at the wwtp inlet cf 2 2 q ww wwtp inlet q gw q bw q f the inflow volume and the total cod at the wwtp inlet did not present any difference with the baseline asm3 model the most significant differences can be observed at the assumptions for total suspended solids tss volatile vss and fixed fss fractions with approx 1 4 lower mass volume as with the asm3 model simulation the difference for parameters total nitrogen tn and tkn corresponds to less than 1 difference between both models as for parameters nhx n and total inorganic nitrogen tninorg increases up to approx 2 of the initial value baseline fractionation the implementation of the module for bw gw separation with the assumed pollutant fractionation for both flows showed that the sustainable sanitation measures could be reliably represented within the model 2 4 definition of system adaptation strategies sas the performed simulations aim at a long term assessment for both the operational behavior of the water management subsystems under consideration and their interactions particular emphasis is laid upon on examining the temporal and spatial implementation of resource oriented sanitation systems and decoupling measures within ten year intervals from 2015 to 2065 two system adaptation strategies were generated using the decision support tool sinoptikom the underlying concept of this tool is a mathematical approach developed within the framework of the research project cross sectoral optimization of transformation processes in municipal infrastructures in rural areas cf schmitt et al 2016 according to various weighting combinations of the following objectives costs flexibility acceptance water and nutrients recycling energy recovery and efficiency and adaption to a natural water balance the tool delivers optimized solutions or transformation paths which comply with different chronological strategical programs i e temporal sequences of system adaptation strategies for the nass and run off decoupling measures proposed thereby the variation and prioritization of the multi criteria objectives within the tool influence the final implementation degrees of all objective functions at issue cf schmitt et al 2014 worreschk et al 2014 the following sas result from two given scenarios which are fully discussed together with the objective functions and their nature of choice in baron 2018 this study comprises the modeling and implementation of the following sas into an existing system baseline scenario to assess its feasibility 2 4 1 system adaptation strategy 1 sas 1 this bundle of measures results from the scenario 100 energy efficiency 50 costs the transformation path for this scenario results from the prioritization of the following objective functions energy efficiency and costs weighted with 100 and 50 respectively the remaining objective functions were weighted with 0 cf baron 2018 according to the temporal sequence of strategies for this scenario on the one hand swale infiltration is implemented as soon as 2015 in all municipalities while the de sealing measure is implemented more gradually into the run off contributing area finally roof greening is only achieved in a minimal area of sc 200 on the other hand the domestic wastewater flow is separated into blackwater for co fermentation and greywater which is treated at the wwtp at the end of the evaluation period the source separation has been implemented at the maximal implementation degree at all municipalities except for sc 200 and 500 fig 9 shows a detailed depiction of the transformation path for scenario 100 energy efficiency 50 costs expressed as a percentage of run off contributing area as well as the daily domestic wastewater flow rate for every municipality 2 4 2 system adaptation strategy 2 sas 2 fig 10 shows the resulting transformation path within the scope of scenario nutrient recovery this scenario results from the weighted sum of the following objective functions costs water and nutrient recycling as well as energy efficiency also the objective functions flexibility acceptance energy recovery and water balance were weighted with 0 prioritization cf baron 2018 likewise the same run off decoupling measures as in the previous sas are part of the chronological strategical program of this transformation path regarding the domestic wastewater flow the implementation of nass measures comprises the recycling of the greywater flow up to the maximum possible rate for all municipalities as well as separation in a smaller extent as in sas 1 into blackwater for co fermentation and greywater to the wwtp moreover within sc 500 a percentage of the greywater flow is treated at a constructed wetland 2 5 simulation runs for the long term assessment of the existing infrastructures a discrete approach is taken into account for the 50 years under study i e six times one year long simulations for the interval 2015 2065 in 10 year steps were performed a simulation of the baseline case and six further simulations for the interval mentioned above the 10 year steps were chosen on the basis of the sas explained above cf 2 4 which depict adaptation changes in the infrastructure for the years 2015 2025 2035 2045 2055 and 2065 for dry weather conditions a characteristic diurnal curve for the study area describes the behavior of the domestic wastewater flow within the model in this study the same diurnal curve was assumed for the baseline scenario as well as the six one year long simulations of the interval as mentioned above the input for weather conditions comprises the recorded precipitation data for a selected year at a resolution of mm 5 min this log data comprises dry and rainy days for the year 2010 it was collected at the hydrometeorological station located at the wwtp and provided by the state office for the environment water management and commerce inspectorate rhineland palatinate the same weather reference year which amounts 812 mm in a year was used for all simulation runs to assess the implementation of sas without regard to any changes in weather conditions 3 results and discussion the effects of the sas implementation are shown regarding the annual discharge volumes and loads of pollutants at the cso infrastructures as well as the impact on the behavior of wwtp operation it is important to note that any cso tank volumes or flow throttles as well as the wwtp dimensions did not undergo any changes during the evaluation period for this assessment 3 1 impact of long term simulation on the sewer system the overflow discharge volumes for sas 1 decreased between 60 and 70 for cso 100 200 400 and 600 as soon as in 2015 this is a consequence of the maximum implementation ratio of the measure swale infiltration cf 2 3 1 in the following years the overflow volumes are reduced up to approximately 80 compared to the baseline sas a slightly more substantial reduction is observed in cso 200 this decrease might be due to the implemented measure roof greening which was not implemented in any other subcatchment furthermore reductions in the overflow volumes for all csos took place in the case of sas 2 however not as balanced as in sas 1 nonetheless the measure implementation achieved an overflow reduction for over 90 for some csos e g 300 400 or 600 these massive overflow volume reductions are mostly because for both sas at the end of the evaluation period only 50 of the paved area stays connected to the sewer system whereby on more than 27 of this remaining area at least one of the run off decoupling measure has been implemented fig 11 shows the overflow load discharge for a pollutant selection in sas 1 left and 2 right respectively similar declining behavior can be observed for both sas overall the pollutant loads in the overflow discharge decreased from approx 62 in the year 2015 up to 88 in 2065 compared to the baseline scenario nonetheless a slightly greater load reduction can be observed for all three selected pollutants when implementing sas 2 wherein the overflow discharge loads decreased from 65 in 2015 up to 90 in 2065 compared to the initial conditions the overflow load reductions for both sas suggest that not only the run off decoupling measures but also the diverted blackwater flow from the combined sewer into the pressure pipeline have an impact on the overflow discharges moreover the differences in wastewater volume and load between both sas for the year 2065 are highlighted by the decrease in drinking water consumption which is a consequence of the measure greywater recycling implemented only in sas 2 fig 12 shows the cso overflow duration and their classification for first flush type cso tanks for sas 1 according to weiss et al 2006 all csos rank into an average overflow duration as of the year 2015 onwards excepting the ones within subcatchments 400 and 500 where either the impervious area is larger than the average or stormwater decoupling measures were not implemented on the maximum possible area at the beginning of the evaluation period at the end of the long term simulation interval all csos show an average overflow duration or even shorter for csos 200 300 and 600 in the case of sas 2 cf fig 13 on the one hand the overflow duration for csos 200 300 and 600 decreased from long to average so soon as the measures in the year 2015 were implemented and up to short and very short at the end of the evaluation period on the other hand the overflow duration for csos 400 and 500 remained unchanged long until the year 2035 however from the year 2045 onwards all csos showed an average or shorter duration furthermore the implemented measure roof greening seems to have a significant impact on the reduction of overflow duration a considerate reduction can be observed in the event of implementation of the measure above for sas 2 in the year 2035 within sc 100 as well as in 2055 within sc 400 and 600 3 2 impact of long term simulation on the wastewater treatment plant fig 14 shows the progressive decline of pollutant loads cod tss and tkn at the inlet of the wwtp as well as the load increase at the inlet of the digestion tank due to blackwater co fermentation for sas 1 left and 2 right the wastewater inflow rate at the inlet of the wwtp as well of the digestion tank have similar reduction rates than the loads it can be noted that for sas 1 because of the implementation of nass measures the pollutant loads shift from being mostly discharged into the wwtp inflow into being received by the digester tank for co fermentation for sas 2 the co fermentation takes place significantly from the year 2045 onwards and on a lower scale implementation which leaves the wwtp inflow as the primary receiver of the pollutant loads the modeled digester tank provides the theoretical amount of degraded cod by the anaerobic treatment the theoretical methane ch4 volume is calculated according to the general equivalence relation between degraded cod load and ch4 which states that 1 kg cod equals 0 35 nm3 ch4 on the aims of simplification it was assumed that the ch4 yield remains constant regardless of the ratio of blackwater to sewage sludge that flows into the digester tank fig 15 shows a box whisker plot of the daily theoretical methane production for both strategies in sas 1 the implemented co fermentation showed a ch4 volume increase of approx 60 on average from the year 2035 onwards compared to the production within the as is state the theoretical methane production for sas 2 related to the as is state decreases down to 5 until the year 2035 and then increases 15 in the year 2045 13 in the year 2055 and finally 36 at the end of simulation time the wwtp infrastructure does not undergo any changes during the considered period of 50 years e g in the volume of the activated sludge tanks for both sas the sludge age was maintained with 16 days as for the as is state using a simple mathematical approach for the excess sludge removal within the modeled biological step therefore the wwtp operation within both strategical programs shows 2 h average values consistently for cod and tn concentration cf fig 16 below the german statutory thresholds for a wwtp with size category 4 the following limit values qualified combined sample or a 2 hour composite sample are applicable for all simulation years threshold for cod concentration 90 g m3 threshold for tn concentration 18 g m3 based on the pollutant loads at the wwtp inlet the facility remains within the same size category through the whole investigation period 4 conclusions this paper

6422,at present increasing requirements for both the efficiency and environmental sustainability of resources demand more knowledge about the feasibility of the implementation of innovative technologies both in a large scale as well as in the long run even at modified sewage flows and characterizations water infrastructures must always remain reliable to guarantee sustainable urban water management dimensioning methods and assessment variables must be adapted to achieve more flexible systems in the long term this paper aims to assess the actual impact of the implementation of new alternative sanitation systems nass as well as stormwater decentralization measures in an existing sewage disposal system with means of a dynamic simulation within a 50 year time interval in 10 years steps two scenario simulations showed that the implementation of the module for blackwater and greywater separation with an assumed pollutant fractionation represents the investigated sustainable sanitation measures reliably results showed a decrease in the overflow discharge loads and duration of the control stormwater infrastructures the wwtp showed a successful chemical oxygen demand cod and total nitrogen elimination tn in all cases nonetheless operational flexibility is fundamental in order to cope with the more unfavorable cod tn ratios of the wwtp inflow after full implementation

incompatibility between the design concept of its infrastructures for long lifespans and the hardly predictable factors which influence their operation in germany areas with low population density have been coping with some core challenges over the years such as demographic decline climate change and stricter discharge standards therefore it is necessary to deeply understand how the different water and wastewater subsystems interact with one another at present increasing requirements for both the resource efficiency and environmental sustainability demand more knowledge about the feasibility of implementation of such technologies in a large scale as well as in the long run nonetheless rural areas have not been extensively investigated using detailed modeling thus far since the challenges mentioned above would result in a slightly different implementation approach as that of urban conglomerates a thorough understanding of the temporal behavior of wastewater systems can be acquired using an integrated model by applying integrated dynamic modeling it is possible to assess the effects of a stepwise implementation of new alternative sanitation systems nass and methods for stormwater decentralization in this matter various studies have focused on decision support solutions for water supply and wastewater discharge concepts as well as on optimization of operating strategies cf kaufmann alves 2013 bach et al 2014 schmitt et al 2014 schütze and alex 2014 furthermore some well known assessments of new sanitation concepts based on integrated dynamic simulation have been developed for urban scenarios cf refsgaard et al 2007 freni et al 2009 rodríguez et al 2009 benetto et al 2009 qin et al 2011 gamerith et al 2012 penn et al 2013 urich and rauch 2014 thus a simplified procedure of wastewater separation into blackwater and greywater bw gw is modeled as a component of the sewer network to assess the long term operation and reliability of an existing wastewater plant wwtp under the timely implementation of various nass measures moreover stormwater decentralization measures are implemented with the concepts mentioned above hence the aim of this paper is the application of a straightforward concept for dynamic modeling to analyze the detailed behavior of the material flows in the sewer as well as to monitor their influence on the centralized wwtp and combined sewer overflow structures cso 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this paper aims to depict a straightforward approach for the integrative simulation therefore it is essential to carry out a detailed outline of the subsystems in question the wwtp catchment area covers 541 hectares ha and is located within the joint municipality enkenbach alsenborn in southwest germany cf fig 1 the study area has an average paved area ratio of 42 and a total population of approx 12 600 inhabitants inh distributed in seven municipalities subcatchments sc with varying socio economical features within the context of a rural region the sewer system operates for the most part as a combined system the daily specific domestic wastewater flow for this region is assumed to be 113 l inh d cf baron 2018 table 1 shows some characteristic values of the catchment area the total retention volume of the csos is approximate to 3000 m3 including the equalization tank at the wwtp inlet the combined sewage overflow discharges into the river alsenz relatively near the source and a few additional contributing streams fig 2 shows the layout of the studied subcatchments and the overflow structures as they are implemented in the model cf 2 2 the average inflow rate under dry weather conditions into the wastewater treatment plant wwtp amounts 31 l s while the designed maximal inflow rate allows as much as 141 l s the facility was designed for a biological oxygen demand bod5 capacity of 21 000 population equivalents pe at present the bod5 load at the wwtp inlet amounts 11 100 pebod5 fig 3 shows a layout of the facility under study the facility also has two units of primary clarifiers with a total volume vtot of 288 m3 the biological treatment takes place as simultaneous nitrification denitrification using two plug flow reactors vtot 4120 m3 with an upstream bio p reactor volume 805 m3 moreover it has two units of secondary clarifiers vtot 2063 m3 as well as an anaerobic digester for sludge stabilization v 1000 m3 table 2 shows some properties of the activated sludge at the facility 2 2 model set up a data model was laid out using the software simba version 2 1 cf alex et al 2015 the modeling approach for the sewer network and the wwtp is an integrative one the structure of the integrated model follows the recommendations of the central european simulation research group cf muschalla et al 2009 within the subcatchments the model influent represents the pollutants as well as the runoff volume for the surface runoff calculation the applied rainfall runoff approach requires rain data in mm 5 min as well as a description of pervious and impervious area of every subcatchment for the runoff calculation various types of losses are considered wetting and depression losses for impervious areas as well as wetting and infiltration losses for pervious areas the calculation of surface runoff is based on the approach of verworn and kenter 1993 a series of linear reservoirs nash cascades describe the sewer network hydraulics of the system finally the calculated runoff flows together with the dry weather flow within pipelines which are defined by constant flow times in this model the parameters i e chemical oxygen demand cod total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn and total phosphorus tp describe the wastewater composition at the outlet of the modules that represent the different wastewater subsystems cf 2 3 the pollutants are fractionated according to the activated sludge model asm3 cf ahnert et al 2015 alex et al 2015 gujer et al 1999 while the runoff volume remains as in the model influent the behavior of the three fractions within the model named influent as well as the 13 fractions described by the asm3 model can be assessed on every stage of the modeled wwtp system as well as at any time of the simulated time interval an assumed flow pattern depicts the diurnal variations of the dry weather flow rate and pollutant s concentration this diurnal flow pattern was validated using water consumption data provided by the municipal utilities as well as operation logs from the wwtp a detailed description of the mathematical approach can be found in the user s manual of simba all municipalities are depicted in the model by one single subcatchment the stormwater control structures are also described as one single structure per subcatchment however the volume of each modeled structure represents the sum of the storage volume of all structures within the municipality the wwtp model includes the primary and secondary treatments as well as a simplified sludge treatment the baseline model approach is shown in fig 4 this model was verified under dry weather conditions using the data of the operation logs from the years 2010 to 2013 flow rates 2 h composite concentrations as well as loads in kg per day for cod ammonium and ammonia nitrogen nhx n and nitrite and nitrate nitrogen nox n at the inlet and outlet were compared to the simulations of a 7 day diurnal flow pattern moreover parameters such as suspended solids and concentration in the biological reactor as well as at the inlet of the digester tank were also taken into account for the verification step the validation of the model resulted from comparing the operation log data from the years 2014 and 2015 for all weather conditions with the simulations under the corresponding logged weather data for the same years the model parameters were adjusted until achieving a simulated wwtp performance between the intervals logged data further details on the two methodic steps are not part of the scope of this paper 2 3 implementation of decentralization nass measures the modeling concept for the software implementation of the nass as well as the run off decoupling measures for long term integrative simulations is represented through modules within the model which are depicted in fig 5 as red boxes the implemented transformation strategies for run off decoupling and nass within the development of the transformation paths were carefully programmed within the model according to the specified concepts outlined in baron et al 2017 baron 2018 2 3 1 stormwater decoupling measures the following three different run off decoupling measures strive for run off reduction roof greening the run off volume from the green roofs flows into the combined sewer together with the remaining stormwater flow de sealing likewise the run off from the de sealed surfaces runs into the combined sewer swale infiltration for this measure the resulting run off volume is completely decoupled from the sewer system table 3 summarizes the set up of the two defining features for the implementation of the measures mentioned above the maximum percentage of the paved area as well as the assumed run off coefficient which are implemented in varying proportions for every municipality 2 3 2 material flow separation a source separation module was applied to represent the wastewater and material flow separation the considered parameters of the module are based on the values recommended by dwa 2014 the separation module can emulate the source separation according to the extent shown in table 4 furthermore fig 6 shows the time dependent behavior of the cod load and flow rate resulting from the simulation with the bw gw separation module under dry weather conditions in a selected municipality the following outflows can be generated according to the selected settings within the module material flow separation wastewater flow the greywater and blackwater flow together into the sewer e g baseline scenario co fermentation the blackwater is drained out with additional pressure pipelines into the digestion tank at the wwtp for co fermentation greywater to wastewater treatment plant the greywater flows into the combined sewer and is treated at the wwtp greywater recycling the greywater is reused within the settlement after proper treatment and finally flows into the combined sewer this implementation leads to a reduction in drinking water consumption up to 40 cf baron et al 2017 the greywater treatment was not considered as part of this study greywater to constructed wetland for this measure a black box approach was assumed i e the operation of the constructed wetland was not modeled within the scope of this study and therefore the wastewater treatment processes within this infrastructure were not further considered hence the greywater flow at issue is decoupled from the sewer system 2 3 3 fractionation of flow components although only a few studies have been carried out directly correlating the fractionation of the parameter cod for greywater and blackwater to the composition of the total sewage water a fractionation for both material flows was assumed based on the literature data evaluation by tolksdorf 2018 the particulate content of cod in blackwater was considered to be approximately 50 60 and in greywater 30 cf tolksdorf 2018 cod biodegradability was also assumed from values stated in tolksdorf 2018 the values for blackwater indicate a degradable cod content between 79 and 95 and for greywater between 82 and 94 and depending on various concepts regarding source separation fig 7 summarizes the assumed fractionation for blackwater and greywater within the source separation module in this regard a sensitivity analysis for cod fractionation regarding nass measures was conducted with the aim of assessing the plausibility of the assumed fractionation an essential part of this assessment is a coherent fractionation of the blackwater and greywater as two separated flows only a proper bw gw separation can satisfy the same fundamental principles of the asm3 model fig 8 shows the results of balancing the pollutant loads at wwtp inlet for a 7 day simulation run under dry weather conditions according to the following two approaches fractionation for baseline scenario complies with the asm3 fractionation for a combined sewer this case consists of a 7 day simulation run with wastewater flow qww the qww comprises the domestic wastewater flow qd plus the extraneous flow qf cf 1 1 q ww wwtp inlet q d q f bw gw fractionation in this case similarly a 7 day simulation run also takes place but with flow separation at the source for all modeled settlements using the assumed fractionation approach cf fig 7 a subsequent re mixing of the separated flows allowed a proper comparison with fractionation of the baseline scenario at the wwtp inlet cf 2 2 q ww wwtp inlet q gw q bw q f the inflow volume and the total cod at the wwtp inlet did not present any difference with the baseline asm3 model the most significant differences can be observed at the assumptions for total suspended solids tss volatile vss and fixed fss fractions with approx 1 4 lower mass volume as with the asm3 model simulation the difference for parameters total nitrogen tn and tkn corresponds to less than 1 difference between both models as for parameters nhx n and total inorganic nitrogen tninorg increases up to approx 2 of the initial value baseline fractionation the implementation of the module for bw gw separation with the assumed pollutant fractionation for both flows showed that the sustainable sanitation measures could be reliably represented within the model 2 4 definition of system adaptation strategies sas the performed simulations aim at a long term assessment for both the operational behavior of the water management subsystems under consideration and their interactions particular emphasis is laid upon on examining the temporal and spatial implementation of resource oriented sanitation systems and decoupling measures within ten year intervals from 2015 to 2065 two system adaptation strategies were generated using the decision support tool sinoptikom the underlying concept of this tool is a mathematical approach developed within the framework of the research project cross sectoral optimization of transformation processes in municipal infrastructures in rural areas cf schmitt et al 2016 according to various weighting combinations of the following objectives costs flexibility acceptance water and nutrients recycling energy recovery and efficiency and adaption to a natural water balance the tool delivers optimized solutions or transformation paths which comply with different chronological strategical programs i e temporal sequences of system adaptation strategies for the nass and run off decoupling measures proposed thereby the variation and prioritization of the multi criteria objectives within the tool influence the final implementation degrees of all objective functions at issue cf schmitt et al 2014 worreschk et al 2014 the following sas result from two given scenarios which are fully discussed together with the objective functions and their nature of choice in baron 2018 this study comprises the modeling and implementation of the following sas into an existing system baseline scenario to assess its feasibility 2 4 1 system adaptation strategy 1 sas 1 this bundle of measures results from the scenario 100 energy efficiency 50 costs the transformation path for this scenario results from the prioritization of the following objective functions energy efficiency and costs weighted with 100 and 50 respectively the remaining objective functions were weighted with 0 cf baron 2018 according to the temporal sequence of strategies for this scenario on the one hand swale infiltration is implemented as soon as 2015 in all municipalities while the de sealing measure is implemented more gradually into the run off contributing area finally roof greening is only achieved in a minimal area of sc 200 on the other hand the domestic wastewater flow is separated into blackwater for co fermentation and greywater which is treated at the wwtp at the end of the evaluation period the source separation has been implemented at the maximal implementation degree at all municipalities except for sc 200 and 500 fig 9 shows a detailed depiction of the transformation path for scenario 100 energy efficiency 50 costs expressed as a percentage of run off contributing area as well as the daily domestic wastewater flow rate for every municipality 2 4 2 system adaptation strategy 2 sas 2 fig 10 shows the resulting transformation path within the scope of scenario nutrient recovery this scenario results from the weighted sum of the following objective functions costs water and nutrient recycling as well as energy efficiency also the objective functions flexibility acceptance energy recovery and water balance were weighted with 0 prioritization cf baron 2018 likewise the same run off decoupling measures as in the previous sas are part of the chronological strategical program of this transformation path regarding the domestic wastewater flow the implementation of nass measures comprises the recycling of the greywater flow up to the maximum possible rate for all municipalities as well as separation in a smaller extent as in sas 1 into blackwater for co fermentation and greywater to the wwtp moreover within sc 500 a percentage of the greywater flow is treated at a constructed wetland 2 5 simulation runs for the long term assessment of the existing infrastructures a discrete approach is taken into account for the 50 years under study i e six times one year long simulations for the interval 2015 2065 in 10 year steps were performed a simulation of the baseline case and six further simulations for the interval mentioned above the 10 year steps were chosen on the basis of the sas explained above cf 2 4 which depict adaptation changes in the infrastructure for the years 2015 2025 2035 2045 2055 and 2065 for dry weather conditions a characteristic diurnal curve for the study area describes the behavior of the domestic wastewater flow within the model in this study the same diurnal curve was assumed for the baseline scenario as well as the six one year long simulations of the interval as mentioned above the input for weather conditions comprises the recorded precipitation data for a selected year at a resolution of mm 5 min this log data comprises dry and rainy days for the year 2010 it was collected at the hydrometeorological station located at the wwtp and provided by the state office for the environment water management and commerce inspectorate rhineland palatinate the same weather reference year which amounts 812 mm in a year was used for all simulation runs to assess the implementation of sas without regard to any changes in weather conditions 3 results and discussion the effects of the sas implementation are shown regarding the annual discharge volumes and loads of pollutants at the cso infrastructures as well as the impact on the behavior of wwtp operation it is important to note that any cso tank volumes or flow throttles as well as the wwtp dimensions did not undergo any changes during the evaluation period for this assessment 3 1 impact of long term simulation on the sewer system the overflow discharge volumes for sas 1 decreased between 60 and 70 for cso 100 200 400 and 600 as soon as in 2015 this is a consequence of the maximum implementation ratio of the measure swale infiltration cf 2 3 1 in the following years the overflow volumes are reduced up to approximately 80 compared to the baseline sas a slightly more substantial reduction is observed in cso 200 this decrease might be due to the implemented measure roof greening which was not implemented in any other subcatchment furthermore reductions in the overflow volumes for all csos took place in the case of sas 2 however not as balanced as in sas 1 nonetheless the measure implementation achieved an overflow reduction for over 90 for some csos e g 300 400 or 600 these massive overflow volume reductions are mostly because for both sas at the end of the evaluation period only 50 of the paved area stays connected to the sewer system whereby on more than 27 of this remaining area at least one of the run off decoupling measure has been implemented fig 11 shows the overflow load discharge for a pollutant selection in sas 1 left and 2 right respectively similar declining behavior can be observed for both sas overall the pollutant loads in the overflow discharge decreased from approx 62 in the year 2015 up to 88 in 2065 compared to the baseline scenario nonetheless a slightly greater load reduction can be observed for all three selected pollutants when implementing sas 2 wherein the overflow discharge loads decreased from 65 in 2015 up to 90 in 2065 compared to the initial conditions the overflow load reductions for both sas suggest that not only the run off decoupling measures but also the diverted blackwater flow from the combined sewer into the pressure pipeline have an impact on the overflow discharges moreover the differences in wastewater volume and load between both sas for the year 2065 are highlighted by the decrease in drinking water consumption which is a consequence of the measure greywater recycling implemented only in sas 2 fig 12 shows the cso overflow duration and their classification for first flush type cso tanks for sas 1 according to weiss et al 2006 all csos rank into an average overflow duration as of the year 2015 onwards excepting the ones within subcatchments 400 and 500 where either the impervious area is larger than the average or stormwater decoupling measures were not implemented on the maximum possible area at the beginning of the evaluation period at the end of the long term simulation interval all csos show an average overflow duration or even shorter for csos 200 300 and 600 in the case of sas 2 cf fig 13 on the one hand the overflow duration for csos 200 300 and 600 decreased from long to average so soon as the measures in the year 2015 were implemented and up to short and very short at the end of the evaluation period on the other hand the overflow duration for csos 400 and 500 remained unchanged long until the year 2035 however from the year 2045 onwards all csos showed an average or shorter duration furthermore the implemented measure roof greening seems to have a significant impact on the reduction of overflow duration a considerate reduction can be observed in the event of implementation of the measure above for sas 2 in the year 2035 within sc 100 as well as in 2055 within sc 400 and 600 3 2 impact of long term simulation on the wastewater treatment plant fig 14 shows the progressive decline of pollutant loads cod tss and tkn at the inlet of the wwtp as well as the load increase at the inlet of the digestion tank due to blackwater co fermentation for sas 1 left and 2 right the wastewater inflow rate at the inlet of the wwtp as well of the digestion tank have similar reduction rates than the loads it can be noted that for sas 1 because of the implementation of nass measures the pollutant loads shift from being mostly discharged into the wwtp inflow into being received by the digester tank for co fermentation for sas 2 the co fermentation takes place significantly from the year 2045 onwards and on a lower scale implementation which leaves the wwtp inflow as the primary receiver of the pollutant loads the modeled digester tank provides the theoretical amount of degraded cod by the anaerobic treatment the theoretical methane ch4 volume is calculated according to the general equivalence relation between degraded cod load and ch4 which states that 1 kg cod equals 0 35 nm3 ch4 on the aims of simplification it was assumed that the ch4 yield remains constant regardless of the ratio of blackwater to sewage sludge that flows into the digester tank fig 15 shows a box whisker plot of the daily theoretical methane production for both strategies in sas 1 the implemented co fermentation showed a ch4 volume increase of approx 60 on average from the year 2035 onwards compared to the production within the as is state the theoretical methane production for sas 2 related to the as is state decreases down to 5 until the year 2035 and then increases 15 in the year 2045 13 in the year 2055 and finally 36 at the end of simulation time the wwtp infrastructure does not undergo any changes during the considered period of 50 years e g in the volume of the activated sludge tanks for both sas the sludge age was maintained with 16 days as for the as is state using a simple mathematical approach for the excess sludge removal within the modeled biological step therefore the wwtp operation within both strategical programs shows 2 h average values consistently for cod and tn concentration cf fig 16 below the german statutory thresholds for a wwtp with size category 4 the following limit values qualified combined sample or a 2 hour composite sample are applicable for all simulation years threshold for cod concentration 90 g m3 threshold for tn concentration 18 g m3 based on the pollutant loads at the wwtp inlet the facility remains within the same size category through the whole investigation period 4 conclusions this paper assessed the impact of the implementation of new alternative sanitation systems as well as stormwater decentralization measures in an existing sewage disposal system with means of a dynamic simulation throughout 50 years between 2015 and 2065 in 10 year steps for each implemented measure a mathematical module depicted the mathematical approach of the measure within the model the overall results for

and retention effect of the reservoir during the transitional period and the potential impact of the reservoir impoundment on the eutrophication of the tgr and estuary water samples were collected in the mainstream and tributaries of changjiang from august to october 2009 and june 2010 to analyze the concentrations of dissolved and particulate nutrients and suspended particulate matter spm the

liu et al 2016 tong et al 2016 diaz et al 2008 excessive nutrient discharges and changes in nutrient ratios which are caused by intense anthropogenic activities and land use changes affect the dynamics of nutrients in the river systems whitney et al 2005 hessen et al 2010 tong et al 2016 seitzinger et al 2010 eutrophication frequent harmful algal blooms and seasonal hypoxia have been observed in the estuaries and coastal marine ecosystems due to the delivery of river nutrients armon et al 2015 garnier et al 2010 romero et al 2013 the changjiang yangtze is the largest river flowing into the west pacific ocean with a drainage area of 1 8 106 km2 annual mean runoff of 9 0 1011 m3 and sediment load of 4 7 108 ton t fan et al 2014 li et al 2007 with growing populations and rapid industrialization in the changjiang basin anthropogenic activities including industrial discharge city sewage agricultural and domestic run off have increasingly led to water quality deterioration gao et al 2016 nitrogen and phosphorus as the essential nutrients that support aquatic primary productivity have exhibited remarkable upward trends in the changjiang over the past 50 years li et al 2007 and approximately 1 43 106 t of din including 1 28 106 t of nitrate no3 and 2 35 105 t of tp are annually transported to the ocean shen et al 2003 yan et al 2003 tong et al 2015 moreover about 3 17 106 t a of dsi is transported into the ecs liu and shen 2001 the three gorges dam tgd began to impound water and sediment discharge on 1st june 2003 when the tgd experimental storage water level reached 175 m in 2009 the water storage capacity of the tgr was 39 3 km3 about 4 5 of the changjiang s annual discharge xu et al 2009 although the amount of sediment transported by the changjiang has gradually decreased due to the construction of the tgd the amount of water entering the sea has not decreased significantly but basically maintained at 9 0 1011 m3 over the past 50 years dai et al 2011 the tgr has been reported to have influenced nutrient and freshwater discharges of the changjiang leading to reduction of primary productivity abnormal salinity and changes in other ecological parameters such as reduction of heterotrophic bacteria in the changjiang estuary and coastal area gong et al 2006 yan et al 2008 jiao et al 2007 so it is very urgent to study the long term effects of the tgd operational mode on the ecosystems of reservoir estuary and ecs 2009 2010 is a critical period for tgr s transition from staged impoundment to full operation at this stage studying the nutrients composition of the changjiang and the nutrients retention in the tgr will have a key guiding significance for nutrients transport from the changjiang to the ecs as well as for the eutrophication of the tgr and estuary under the full operation of the reservoir since 2010 but at present most of the researches have focused on the changes of nutrients huang et al 2014 lou et al 2016 xia et al 2018 distribution of algae composition zeng et al 2006a the estimation of retention effects zhang et al 1999 2003 ran et al 2009 ran et al 2013 in the reservoir and the changes of estuarine ecosystems etc chai et al 2009 jiang et al 2014 zhou et al 2008 before and after tgr impoundment few studies have focused on the nutrients in the entire changjiang basin and nutrients retention in the tgr during this transitional period since 2003 the long term potential impact of the tgr impoundment on eutrophication of the reservoir estuary and ecs is rarely known based on the observations in 2009 2010 this study aims to provide a deeper and systematic understanding of nutrient dynamics and biogeochemistry in the changjiang the box model is used to estimate the retention effect of tgr on nutrients in the river combined with the historical data of the reservoir and estuary the potential impacts of the tgr staged storage in 2003 2009 and normal storage since 2010 on the eutrophication of reservoir estuary and ecs are further evaluated in order to provide a certain historical and theoretical basis for the coordination between the tgr regulation model and sustainable ecological health of the estuary in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the changjiang extends over 6300 km from its headwaters in the qinghai tibet plateau to the east china sea generally the area from the source to yichang in hubei is defined as the upstream of the changjiang it is 4500 km long with a basin area of 1 0 106 km2 fig 1 the midstream 955 km long is the reach from yichang to hukou hk in jiangxi and the downstream segment is defined as the reach from hukou to the changjiang estuary shanghai the tgd is located about 44 km upstream of yichang fig 1 the jinshajiang lies on the upper stream of the changjiang which is the region of 3000 6300 km from the river mouth some tributaries such as yalongjiang ylj minjiang mj jialingjiang jlj tuojiang tj fujiang fj daduhe ddh and hanjiang hj are in the north other tributaries including wujiang wj niulanjiang nlj and chishuihe csh are in the south in addition the dongting lake dtl connecting the xiangjiang xj yuanjiang yj and zishui zs and the poyang lake pyl connecting the ganjiang gj and fuhe fh are located in the south of the main channel the sampling stations are shown in fig 1 2 2 sample collection from august to october 2009 and june 2010 water samples in the mainstream and tributaries of the changjiang were collected with 20 l niskin bottles at three different depths surface intermediate and near bottom at each station dissolved nutrient samples were filtered in situ using 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membranes that had been pre soaked for 24 h with 1 1000 hcl and then washed to neutral ph with milli q water the filtrates were preserved by the addition of saturated hgcl2 on return to the laboratory the filters were dried at 50 c for 72 h and reweighed to determine the mass of spm spm was analyzed for pip tpp and bsi 2 3 chemical analyses nutrients no3 no2 and dsi were analyzed using an autoanalyzer skalar sanplus system liu et al 2012 po4 3 was measured manually by phosphomolyb denum blue method grasshoff et al 1999 nh4 was measured manually by sodium hypobromite oxidation method gao et al 1980 tdn and tdp were measured using alkaline potassium persulfate oxidation method grasshoff et al 1999 the analytical precision was 0 06 μmol l for no3 0 01 μmol l for no2 0 15 μmol l for dsi 0 03 μmol l for po4 3 0 09 μmol l for nh4 0 68 μmol l for tdn and 0 02 μmol l for tdp din concentration was the sum of no3 no2 and nh4 don and dissolved organic phosphorus dop were the difference between tdn and din and between tdp and po4 3 respectively spm was ashed at 550 c for 2 h and then was extracted with hcl 1 m 16 h for tpp analysis aspila et al 1976 pip was determined by extraction of uncombusted samples for 16 h in 1 m hcl aspila et al 1976 pop was the difference between tpp and pip tp was the sum of tpp and tdp the analytical precision was 0 5 for pip and tpp n 5 bsi was measured in our laboratory with modifications to the methods of ragueneau et al 2005 briefly spm was subjected to three steps digestion 0 2 m naoh ph 13 3 at 100 c for 40 min in the first and second leach all the bsi was converted into si oh 4 si and al concentrations si 1 al 1 si 2 and al 2 in the supernatant were analyzed in the third leach after the filter was rinsed and dried the si al 3 ratio of silicate minerals present in the spm was determined so the corrected bsi concentration was given by bsi si 1 si 2 al 1 al 2 si 3 al 3 here the al concentration was determined by the modified aluminum fluorescent gallium al lmg complex fluorescence spectrophotometry ren et al 2001 hydes and liss 1976 the analytical precision was 5 for bsi 2 4 nutrient budgets for the tgr and data source as shown in fig 1 there are three major input rivers in the upstream of the tgr including the changjiang mainstream jialingjiang and wujiang han et al 2016 it was reported that the sum water flux of the three upstream input rivers accounted for 90 8 of the total water flux of the tgr wang et al 2009 therefore fuling is regarded as the control station of three major input rivers entering the tgr in this study a box model is adopted to estimate the nutrient input output mass balance for the tgr fig 2 ran et al 2013 2015 it is hypothesized that the total input to the reservoir including the upstream inflow at the fuling the lateral input from the sub catchment of the tgr urban domestic sewage industrial and agricultural pollution and atmospheric deposition must be equal to the losses including the output at the dam yichang and the reservoir retention the equation is as follows 1 l i l t l p l d l s l o l r where li represents the upstream nutrients input load of tgr including the changjiang mainstream jialingjiang and wujiang lt represents the lateral nutrients input load from the sub catchment of the tgr here to avoid the pseudo retention effect caused by freshwater discharge difference the water discharge of the lateral input is the difference between upstream inflow and downstream outflow of the tgr kelly 2001 ran et al 2013 lp represents the industrial and agricultural pollution load ls represents urban domestic sewage lp and ls only considers the part that is directly discharged into the main stream of the reservoir ld represents atmospheric deposition nutrient load lo represents the downstream output loads of the tgr and lr is the net retention of the reservoir data sources are shown in table 2 the retention efficiency is considered as a parameter to evaluate and identify the retention effect of the dam or reservoir on nutrients here the retention efficiency is defined and calculated as follows harrison et al 2009 ran et al 2009 2 retention efficiency l i l t l p l d l s l o l i l t l p l d l s 100 3 results 3 1 hydrographic features fig 3 a showed that the changjiang carried a large volume of water to the east china sea during the study period an increasing trend was observed within the main channel from the upper to lower reaches at the upstream hydrographic station of fuling the monthly average water flow between 2009 and 2010 respectively exceeded 509 108 and 323 108 m3 due to the inflow from several large tributaries including the yalongjiang minjiang jialingjiang and wujiang table 1 after the tgd the monthly mean water discharge at yichang in august to october 2009 was comparable to that at fuling however in june 2010 the water discharge at the yichang increased by 44 than that at fuling fig 3a table 1 and then the monthly mean water discharge respectively increased to 812 108 and 1305 108 m3 at datong after the inflow from the hanjiang and dongting lake connecting zishui yuanjiang and xiangjiang and poyang lake connecting ganjiang and fuhe table 1 in addition the mean water discharge in the mid downstream section increased by 39 60 in 2010 than in 2009 from the impact of concentrated heavy rainfall during the study period wang 2010 the spm concentrations had a significant negative correlation p 0 05 r 0 816 n 8 with water discharge along the changjiang the spm concentrations varied between 4 49 and 534 mg l with an average of 124 mg l in the main channel a decreasing trend was observed within the main channel from the upper to middle reaches fig 3b in 2009 spm concentration decreased to 33 7 mg l at fuling due to the deposition of suspended particulate matter and the dilution of water discharge after the tgd spm concentration at yichang 22 3 mg l decreased by 34 compared to that at fuling then slowly increased to 50 3 mg l at datong besides the concentrations of spm from datong station to the estuary in 2010 were significantly higher than that in 2009 due to heavy rainfall fig 3b 3 2 spatial patterns of nutrient concentrations in the mainstream of the changjiang the distributions of nh4 and no2 were similar to each other fig s1 d and c the average level of nh4 and no2 accounted for 5 4 and 0 7 of tdn respectively in 2009 the nutrient concentrations in the upper reaches slowly increased to 6 69 µmol l for nh4 and 0 90 µmol l for no2 at fuling and then decreased to 1 07 µmol l for nh4 and 0 15 µmol l for no2 at yichang respectively in the middle reaches the concentrations of nh4 and no2 increased by one order of magnitude than those in the upper reaches further downstream the nutrient concentrations decreased to fairly stabilization in the region of 350 700 km from the river mouth and then the average level respectively increased to 8 12 µmol l for nh4 and 1 06 µmol l for no2 in the area 0 300 km from the estuary no3 din and tdn had a similar tendency figs 4 a s1a and b the nutrient concentrations were quite low in the jinshajiang with averages of 29 2 µmol l for no3 30 3 µmol l for din and 35 9 µmol l for tdn respectively and increased significantly to 135 µmol l for no3 142 µmol l for din and 152 µmol l for tdn at fuling respectively subsequently decreased to 97 5 µmol l for no3 98 3 µmol l for din and 112 µmol l for tdn at fengjie respectively further mid downstream no3 concentration basically remained stable except in the region of 300 km from the river mouth in 2009 fig 4a however din and tdn concentrations slightly increased in the midstream and decreased to fairly stable in the downstream with a similar tendency to nitrate fig s1 a and b no3 was the main form of nitrogen in the changjiang accounting for 84 1 of tdn fig s1 a also indicated that the average concentration of inorganic n in the tributaries of changjiang was significantly higher than that of the main stream including the jialingjiang minjiang tuojiang and hanjiang in the north and wujiang in the south while the inorganic n concentration in the yalongjiang was the lowest in all tributaries the average don concentration fig s1e was relatively high compared with that of nh4 and no2 which accounted for 9 8 of tdn the concentration ranged from 0 65 to 17 13 µmol l with an average of 7 23 µmol l in the mainstream the don concentration was rather low in the upper reaches significantly increased to 12 43 µmol l by average in the tgr and decreased further in the mid downstream except for the region of 500 700 km from the estuary meanwhile the average concentration of don in the mid downstream of the changjiang in 2009 was almost three times that of 2010 fig s1e in the main stream of the changjiang the distribution of po4 3 fig 4b was similar to that of tdp fig s1f po4 3 averagely accounted for 73 3 of tdp and 35 4 of tp respectively like no3 din and tdn po4 3 concentrations were quite low in the jinshajiang with an average of 0 21 µmol l and increased by a factor of more than 10 in the tgr decreased to lower value after the tgd and then slightly increased to stable concentrations basically in the mid downstream in 2009 fig 4b but in 2010 there was a large fluctuation for po4 3 concentrations in the midstream dop was considered to be a smaller part of the tdp about 26 7 the dop concentration ranged from 0 19 to 1 19 µmol l with an average of 0 61 µmol l in the mainstream the dop concentration decreased significantly in the area 4100 3200 km from the river mouth increased to the highest value at fuling probably due to the effect of the tributaries such as the yalongjiang daduhe and minjiang fig s1g and gradually decreased in the mid downstream in the lower reaches of the changjiang the average dop concentration in 2010 was twice that in 2009 the concentrations of pip and tpp varied from 0 22 to 9 50 µmol l and 0 32 to 13 36 µmol l with averages of 2 05 µmol l and 2 69 µmol l in the main channel respectively the average pip and tpp concentrations in the upstream of tgr in 2009 were 5 7 times as high as that of the middle and lower reaches of the changjiang and reached the lowest values with 0 43 and 0 66 µmol l in the tgr respectively figs s1 i and 4c in 2010 pip and tpp concentrations in the mid downstream were lower than those in 2009 besides in the region of 2400 4200 km from the river mouth pip and tpp concentrations in the tributaries were significantly lower p 0 01 than that in the mainstream like dop the pop was also considered to be an important fraction of the tpp pop averagely accounted for 24 0 of tpp and 12 4 of tp pop concentrations were between 0 04 and 3 86 µmol l with an average of 0 65 µmol l in the mainstream the average concentrations of pop and pip in the mid downstream in 2010 were smaller compared with 2009 fig s1j and i the concentrations of tp were between 1 51 and 14 67 µmol l on average of 4 87 µmol l in the main channel its concentrations in 2009 were quite higher in a region of 2400 4200 km from the river mouth decreased by a factor of about 3 in the tgr increased in the midstream due to the inflow of hanjiang and then decreased gradually in the downstream fig s1h the average tp concentration in the northern tributaries was almost 2 times higher than that in the southern the concentration of particulate p pp in the jinshajiang was significantly higher than that of dissolved p 1µmol l and pp accounted for more than 85 95 of tp dsi concentration ranged from 70 8 to 127 µmol l with an average of 105 µmol l in the mainstream the average concentration of dsi in the mid downstream was almost similar to that in the upstream fig 4d the average concentration of silicate in the northern tributaries was comparable to that of the southern tributaries but somewhat higher than that of the mainstream of the changjiang the bsi concentrations were between 0 11 and 29 4 µmol l with an average of 11 07 µmol l in the changjiang the average concentration of bsi was relative high in a region of 2400 4200 km from the estuary decreased by a factor of 3 in the tgr increased to the maximum value of 13 24 µmol l and then decreased at the lower reaches of changjiang in 2009 fig 4e in 2010 the bsi concentration in the downstream was significantly higher than that of the midstream p 0 01 fig 4e in addition the distribution of bsi in 2010 was closely related to that of spm r 0 685 n 43 p 0 01 in 2009 the concentrations of bsi in most of the tributaries were lower than that of the mainstream of the changjiang fig 4e 3 3 nutrient fluxes and areal yields nutrient fluxes in the main channel and main tributaries were calculated as follows ran et al 2013 2015 3 f load c q where fload is the monthly flux of nutrients c is the average concentration of nutrients and q is the monthly average freshwater discharge at the hydrological control station table 1 the monthly yields of nutrients were estimated based on the average monthly fluxes of nutrients and drainage area liu et al 2009 the monthly fluxes and area yields of nutrient in the changjiang mainstream and its main tributaries in 2009 are shown in tables 3 and 4 affected by the monthly average water discharge along the changjiang the fluxes of no3 din and tdn increased from the upstream to the mouth in the mainstream p 0 01 except at the huangshi where the values of din and tdn fluxes were higher due to higher fluxes of nh4 and no2 table 3 however the changes of don flux in the mainstream were controlled by both concentration and water discharge p 0 01 table 3 additionally no3 din and tdn yields from upstream to huangshi had increased significantly by a factor of 4 than that in upstream and no3 yield remained relatively stable from huangshi to yangzhou table 4 although the monthly mean fluxes of nh4 and no2 in tributaries were much lower than those in mainstream their monthly yields were about 1 4 times higher than that of mainstream tables 3 and 4 the don yields increased by more than 6 times from the upper to the wuhu but decreased sharply in the yangzhou table 4 the average don yields in the tributaries were comparable to that of the main stream affected by the changes of water discharge along the changjiang the monthly fluxes of po4 3 and tdp were much lower in the upstream and increased significantly in the mid downstream but the dop fluxes were relative low in the upstream increased rapidly from the jiangjin to wuhu and then decreased suddenly in the yangzhou table 3 dop inputs to mainstream from the yalongjiang and minjiang were estimated to be respectively 1 38 107 and 2 15 107 mol month which had important impact on the fluxes of dop in the upstream besides the average yields of po4 3 and tdp increased first and then gradually stabilized from the upstream to downstream table 4 and the average yields of po4 3 and tdp were comparable in the northern and southern tributaries and were almost twice that of the mainstream table 4 however dop yields decreased at jiangjin in the upstream increased to the highest value at yichang and significantly decreased in the mid downstream table 4 all dop yields in the tributaries were higher than those in the mainstream except for hanjiang and wujiang table 4 in contrast the fluxes of pip pop tpp and tp in the mainstream were more affected by concentration p 0 01 their fluxes increased from the upstream to jiangjin sharply decreased at the yichang and then increased in the lower reaches table 3 meanwhile the trend of their yields were similar to their fluxes table 4 interestingly their maximum fluxes and yields were closely related to the particulate matter in the jiangjin area where concentration of spm was the highest fig 3b besides the fluxes of pip pop tpp and tp in all the tributaries were less than those in the mainstream table 3 the dsi flux increased from the upstream to the mouth but bsi flux increased to 54 3 107 mol month at jiangjin sharply decreased to 16 0 107 mol month at the yichang and then increased in the mid downstream table 3 the fluxes of dsi and bsi in all the tributaries were less than those in the mainstream besides silicate yields were rather low in the upstream and then increased by a factor of 0 6 from the yichang to yangzhou table 4 the bsi yields in the upstream were significantly higher than that of the mid downstream interestingly bsi yields was the lowest at the yichang after the tgd table 4 however the dsi yields in all tributaries were at least 1 3 times than that of the mainstream except for hanjiang and wujiang table 4 the monthly average bsi yield of the tributaries was 45 of that of the mainstream table 4 3 4 nutrients retention of the tgr in 2009 the monthly average water discharge at zhutuo beibei wulong which are the control sections in the changjiang mainstream jialingjiang wujiang and yichang accounted for 15 7 16 8 6 8 and 12 9 of the annual average water discharge respectively during the survey period in 2009 table 1 because of seasonal changes of the nutrient concentrations and water discharge in the reservoir the retention of nutrients in the tgr also had obvious seasonality therefore in order to avoid the pseudo retention effect caused by freshwater discharge difference the annual retention load and efficiency of nutrients in the tgr in 2009 were further estimated although there is great uncertainty in this estimate and difficulty in assessing the uncertainty the estimation lay a good theoretical foundation and data support for evaluating the response of nutrients in the changjiang to the operation scheme of tgr in the future the total inflow load of din and tdn were 77 29 104 t a and 83 25 104 t a respectively in which about 91 of the din and tdn input came from the upstream of the tgr and approximately 6 of this input came from the lateral load from the sub catchment of the tgr the total outflow load of din and tdn were 59 16 104 t a and 65 56 104 t a respectively so din and tdn retained in the tgr would be 23 5 and 21 2 of the total inflow load respectively table 5 however total don input load 5 96 104 t a was significantly lower than the total output load 6 41 104 t a about 0 45 104 t a of don was produced in the tgr which accounted for 7 5 of the total inflow load table 5 po4 3 was the main tdp retained in the tgr and accounted for 61 9 of the retained tdp load the retention of dop 1 4 observed was clearly lower than that of po4 3 31 2 table 5 the input 10 36 103 t a and output 10 21 103 t a loads of dop were comparable which showed that the retention of dop in the reservoir was relatively weak the differences between input and output load of tdp and tpp were 7 66 103 t a and 3 21 103 t a respectively this differences accounted for 22 2 and 30 8 of the tdp and tpp inflow loads respectively the retention of tpp was obvious however tdp retained in the tgr was dominant which was about 70 5 of the retained tp table 5 the total inflow load of dsi from the upstream and lateral input of the tgr was 122 84 104 t a tables 1 and 2 in which approximately 92 of dsi input came from the upstream of tgr the total outflow load of dsi was 119 42 104 t a thus 3 42 104 t a of dsi was retained by the tgr which accounted for 2 8 of the total inflow load table 5 the bsi inflow and outflow load were respectively 5 31 104 and 3 49 104 t a tables 1 and 2 for bsi approximately 1 82 104 t a was trapped by the tgr which accounted for 34 3 of the total inflow load table 5 obviously the retention of bsi was higher than that of dsi but the retained bsi accounted for 34 7 of retained total silicon bsi dsi in the tgr and bsi bsi dsi decreased from 4 1 at the inflow to 2 8 at the outflow this indicated that dsi was the main contributor to total silicon retained in the tgr 4 discussion 4 1 biogeochemistry of nutrients in the river nutrient levels showed a wide range of variation along the changjiang generally the excess din was derived from intense anthropogenic activities such as municipal sewage discharge extensive agricultural land leaching and aquaculture water discharge etc liu et al 2011 most previous studies e g shen et al 2003 hao et al 2006 yan et al 2010 indicated that n fertilizer was the main source of din in the changjiang from the 1970s to 1990s however the growth rate of n fertilizer application dropped significantly after 2000 and domestic sewage a major din source had dramatically driven up din loads in the changjiang from 2000 to 2010 xu et al 2013 in this study the mean level of din 100 8 µmol l fig s1a in the changjiang was comparable with those reported for polluted waters 110 µmol l smith et al 2003 and pearl river 113 8 µmol l less than those in the yellow river 318 4 µmol l but higher than those in the mississippi atchafalaya river 94 5 µmol l congo river 14 8 µmol l amazon river 10 4 µmol l yenisey river 26 0 µmol l and mekong river 12 6 µmol l table 6 po4 3 1 57 µmol l concentrations in the changjiang were higher than those in the yellow river 0 38 µmol l and pearl river 0 70 µmol l but lower than those in the mississippi atchafalaya river 2 50 µmol l nile 2 40 µmol l and congo river 2 20 µmol l table 6 however po4 3 concentrations had a significant negative correlation with the concentrations of spm p 0 01 due to abundant spm average of 124 mg l in the chanjiang po4 3 was easily adsorbed by the suspended particulates liu et al 2009 besides dsi in rivers was mainly released from phytolith dissolution and silicate weathering ma et al 2017 the weathering was constrained by the interaction of tectonic activities rock type and climate liu et al 2011 during the study period the mean level of dsi 104 8 µmol l in the mainstream was comparable to that of the yellow river 108 8 µmol l mississippi atchafalaya river 108 0 µmol l amazon 117 6 µmol l and congo river 115 8 µmol l and much lower than that of the mekong river 245 5 µmol l table 6 therefore the changjiang was enriched with din and dsi and depleted with respect to po4 3 with very high din po4 3 43 356 and dsi po4 3 29 1281 molar ratios while the dsi din ratios was in the range of 0 52 3 94 fig 5 a b and c according to the critical ratios of redfield et al 1963 and justic et al 1995 changjiang still is potentially p limited which is similar to previous studies liu et al 2016 froelich 1988 suggested that the adsorption of po4 3 by particles proceeds via a two step mechanism the first involving rapid po4 3 adsorption desorption at the particle surface and the second involving slow solid state diffusion of the adsorbed po4 3 from the surface of the particle to the interior so the kd partitioning coefficient given as kd p c where p µmol g and c µmol l are the particulate and dissolved concentrations respectively approach can be used to quantify the partitioning of p between the particle and dissolved phase and the evaluation of its particle reactivity fang et al 2000 the logkd values for inorganic p in the mainstream of the changjiang ranged from 0 48 to 2 31 with an average of 1 12 which were obviously less than the value 4 80 in the pearl river estuary 4 59 in the humber estuary and 4 62 in the amazon estuary li et al 2017 prastka et al 1994 in 2009 the logkd values in the mainstream significantly decreased in the upstream 2400 4200 km from the river mouth and then remained around 1 in the downstream where concentrations of spm were between 22 29 and 72 73 mg l fig 6 a it has been demonstrated that the kd values exhibited an inverse relationship with spm 20 mg l and remained fairly constant when the spm concentration was higher than 20 mg l li et al 2017 fang 2000 therefore the dependence of phosphate particle dissolved interactions on spm decreased in the mid downstream with high spm concentrations 20 mg l during the survey period the changjiang was depleted with don dop and pop fig s1e g and j dissolved organic nutrients were less bioavailable than dissolved inorganic forms cotner and wetzel 1992 but dop and po4 3 may be used by the phytoplankton huang et al 2005 although microbial n uptake was generally dominated by din especially nh4 don both urea and dissolved free amino acids also served as an important n source and could fueled bacterial production and remineralization veuger et al 2004 pomeroy 1974 in the present study don concentrations in the region before the tgd were higher than that in the upstream of the tgr fig s1e and might contribute to the composition of the microbial plankton community in the region before the tgd besides in the case of phosphate limitation in the water column microorganisms may obtain phosphate by utilizing alkaline phosphatase activity apa to degrade organic phosphorus pop or dop compounds artigas et al 2012 in 2009 pop dop l g in the mainstream increased along the river and reached to the highest value in the estuary fig 6a which could promote apa synthesis of particle attached microorganisms dyhrman et al 2006 and apa degraded pop to produce po4 3 into the water may have a potential impact on receiving coastal marine ecosystems the value of tpp tp decreased by 66 from the upstream to the tgr and the concentration of tp also decreased by 61 which indicated that the particulate phosphorus was the major type of component among the phosphorus species in the upstream tpp tp 90 ding et al 2010 huang et al 2014 in addition the average level of spm decreased by 93 from the upstream to the tgr fig 3b which further indicated that pp accompanied with spm was intercepted and retained in the tgr even during the flood season in 2017 the tgr trapped nearly 76 of spm and 75 of pp tang et al 2018 the main sources of bsi in aquatic ecosystems were the erosion input of terrestrial ecosystems and the production of phytoplankton ma et al 2017 the average bsi concentrations in the changjiang were 11 07 µmol l lower than that of the rhine river 23 40 µmol l amazon river 73 90 µmol l and yellow river 40 20 µmol l but slightly higher than that of the congo river 9 70 µmol l table 6 obviously the bsi level in the changjiang was at a low level in the world s rivers average 28 00 µmol l conley 1997 4 2 nutrients retention in the tgr the retention efficiency of din and tdn in the tgr were 23 5 and 21 2 respectively table 5 in the present study no3 tdn at yichang 89 3 was compared to that at fuling 88 6 fig 4a but no2 tdn and nh4 tdn at yichang respectively decreased by 81 and 80 compared with that of fuling fig s1c and d while don tdn increased by 52 table 2 this implies that the composition of nitrogen in the tgr had changed because of the reservoir effect generally when reactive n enters the reservoir it would be faced with a variety of potential fates such as nitrification denitrification burial uptake by aquatic plants eg diatoms and adsorption on particulates etc harrison et al 2009 wang et al 2010 the reduction of nh4 and no2 at yichang may partly be as a result of algal assimilation to produce don sun et al 2013 therefore based on our mass balance calculation tgr served as a don source in the river table 5 besides denitrification at the surface sediments was considered to be the main mechanism of nitrogen removal in the reservoir but n removal via denitrification was much lower in the main stream of the changjiang before the construction of the tgd yan et al 2004 if denitrification in the tgr was estimated based on 7 16 of total input tdn load 8 32 105 t in the reservoirs at the global scale seitzinger et al 2006 after the full operation of the tgr 33 75 of retained tdn table 5 would be removed via denitrification furthermore according to the denitrification and the surface area of tgr 1080 km2 xu et al 2011 the denitrification rate 54 123 g n m 2 a 1 would be similar to the observed 108 g n m 2 a 1 in lake shelbyville illinois u s a david et al 2006 where the no3 content was comparable to that of the tgr however although longer residence time accelerated denitrification it was difficult to evaluate the strength of denitrification depending on our available data the retention efficiency of po4 3 and tdp in the tgr were 31 2 and 22 2 table 5 respectively like nitrogen the composition of phosphorus changed significantly due to the reservoir effect of the tgr in particular dop tp increased from 17 7 at fuling to 30 0 at yichang while po4 3 tp decreased from 54 9 at fuling to 48 7 at yichang table 2 meanwhile diatom was observed to be the dominant algae species in the tgr during the study period yang et al 2012 therefore the growth of diatom lowered the po4 3 concentration and increased the dop concentration in the tgr in order to study the uptake of po4 3 by phytoplankton in reservoirs we made the following estimates a primary production model canfield et al 1981 output showed that primary production in the tgr was 350 g c m 2 a 1 with a range of 262 5 437 5 g c m 2 a 1 zhang et al 1999 here we proposed a way of estimating fixed po4 3 flux using the typical c p ratio of 106 1 for phytoplankton assimilation redfield et al 1963 the model output showed that the potential primary production in the tgr would be 0 21 0 34 mol m 2 a 1 which corresponded to a total annual po4 3 fixation of 6 91 103 11 52 103 t a taking into account the surface area of 1080 km2 at the water level of 175 m after the impoundment of tgr in fact 7 52 103 t a of po4 3 table 5 was retained in the tgr based on our mass balance calculation in addition the retention mechanism of phosphorus in the reservoir was mainly based on the sedimentation of pp kennedy et al 1990 in this study the retention efficiency of tpp 30 8 was significantly higher than that of tdp 22 2 and 3 21 103 t a of tpp was trapped in the tgr which accounted for 30 of tp load retained in the tgr table 5 as discussed in section 4 1 the retention of pp in the reservoir was closely related to the sedimentation of particulate matters when the impounded water level increased from 135 m in 2003 to 175 m in 2010 the deposition of particulate matters in the tgr dramatically increased from 12 40 million tons in 2003 to 19 60 million tons in 2010 changjiang water resource commission 2000 2016 therefore impoundment to 175 m obviously engendered a considerably large amount of particulate matters as well as pp deposition in the tgr tang et al 2018 after the full operation of the tgd lower flow velocity prolonged residence time high transparency and high nutrient levels excess n and p stimulated the growth of phytoplankton especially diatoms yang et al 2012 diatoms i e biological uptake dsi and conversion to bsi were more likely to be deposited than other planktonic algae and the lower dissolution rate of bsi siliceous shell limited the regeneration of silicon resulting in the removal of silicon in the reservoir humborg et al 2006 additionally silicon fixation in the tgr was estimated from the primary production model canfield et al 1981 zhang et al 1999 total primary productivity had been described above in detail here a way of estimating fixed dsi flux was proposed by using the typical c si ratio of 106 16 for phytoplankton assimilation redfield et al 1963 the primary productivity of diatoms can be calculated by using the ratio of diatom primary productivity to total primary productivity which is usually 1 2 in freshwater ecosystems chinese encyclopedia compilation committee 1987 therefore the model output showed that the total annual dsi fixation was 4 99 104 8 32 104 t a taking into account the surface area of 1080 km2 at the water level of 175 m after the impoundment of tgr in fact 3 42 104 t a dsi was trapped in the reservoir based on our mass balance calculation which indicates that the retained dsi may be all assimilated by diatoms consequently based on the typical n p si ratio of 16 1 16 for phytoplankton assimilation redfield et al 1963 6 84 104 t a din and 4 28 103 t a po4 3 were assimilated by phytoplankton according to our mass balance estimates the retention of nutrients in the tgr varied during the three staged impoundment table 5 when the first impoundment to 135 m the retention of din 1 7 2005 in the tgr had no obvious changes compared with that 1 9 1997 before the impoundment subsequently the intercept of din increased from 1 7 in 2005 135 m to 8 9 in 2007 156 m and 23 5 in 2009 175 m however the retention of po4 3 had no statistical significance at different water levels moreover the tgr had a relatively small retention of dsi and even acted as a source of dsi table 5 and the retention of dsi in the tgr at the pre and post impoundment were far lower than the level 18 19 in reservoirs of the global river basins beusen et al 2009 normally nutrient loads were mainly controlled by water discharge based on the above assumptions detail in section 2 4 the annual average water discharge of the lateral input in 1997 2005 2007 and 2009 was 12 1 12 6 10 7 and 9 4 of total inflow of tgr respectively if these estimates subtracted the annual water discharges from 11 tributaries more than 100 tributaries in the tgr whose drainage area are more than 1500 km2 http www cqwater gov cn these differences in 1997 2005 2007 and 2009 would account for 6 1 7 8 5 2 and 3 5 of total inflow of tgr respectively these estimates were considered valid in this study additionally monthly averages of nutrients were used as annual averages in the estimates due to limited data availability thus there were some uncertainties in this estimate the most obvious feature was the operational state of the reservoir the data of nutrient concentrations in 2005 and 2007 mainly came from april to may when the reservoir was in the discharge stage but the concentrations in 2009 were mainly obtained in september october when the reservoir was in the impoundment stage in these different stages of operation not only the hydrology had obvious changes such as water level changjiang sediment bulletin but other parameters such as temperature chl a dissolved oxygen ph and algae distribution also had significant changes zeng et al 2006a therefore these uncertainties must be improved in future work 4 3 effect of impoundment on eutrophication in the tgr the impoundment of the tgr had changed the original hydrodynamic conditions of the river the most obvious feature was the slow flow velocity in the reservoir when the tgr impoundment reached the height of 175 m the average water flow rate decreased to 0 09 2 43 m s which was much lower than that 3 5 m s observed in natural changjiang channels tang et al 2018 china national environmental monitoring centre 1998 2017 the reduced flow rate led to longer water retention time during 2003 2009 monthly residence time of the tgr mainstream ranged from 5 to 77 d day with an average of 27 d while that for xiangxi bay a tributary of tgr was 26 538 d with an average of 179 d xu et al 2011 obviously monthly residence time was often shorter in the mainstream than in the tributaries accordingly the reduced water flow would also result in the settlement of spm and the increase of water transparency in the reservoir and tributaries however the sedimentation of spm in the changjiang was closely related to deposition of tpp r 0 966 n 46 p 0 01 so with the decrease of spm fig 3b the ratio of tdp tpp in reservoir would increase fig 6b changing the partitioning of p between the dissolved and particle phase in addition the level of nutrients in the tgr and tributaries had exceeded the internationally recognized threshold of eutrophication tn 14 29 µmol l tp 0 65 µmol l thomann et al 1987 therefore under suitable temperature and light intensity algal blooms would occur in the reservoir and its tributaries zhang et al 2012 historical data showed that since 2003 the impoundment of tgr resulted in the water eutrophication in the tgr and its tributaries china national environmental monitoring centre 1998 2017 not only the sensitive period for the occurrence of algal bloom extended from march july in 2004 to march october after 2007 but the number of tributaries affected by algal blooms also increased from 3 in 2003 to 11 22 after 2009 tang et al 2018 more importantly the trophic status of the tgr was mainly mesotrophic with the average proportion of 68 but the proportion of slight eutrophication significantly increased from 10 in 2005 to 27 in 2010 and fluctuated between 22 and 27 after 2010 except for 2011 fig 7 china national environmental monitoring centre 1998 2017 this implies that there was a risk of algal outbreaks in the reservoir and tributaries in addition the species composition of phytoplankton in the mainstream of the tgr was basically the same before and after the impoundment and diatoms green algae and cyanobacteria were the main species observed from 1999 to 2008 by qiu et al 2011 4 4 the influence of the tgr on nutrient transports in the estuary and its ecological significance as a typical reservoir of sediment retaining and no water retaining the tgr played a major role in the interception of nutrients transported from the upper reaches to the middle and lower reaches of the changjiang xu et al 2009 after the impoundment of the tgr reached 135 m in 2003 about 18 of tn 15 of tp and 20 of dsi were trapped in the reservoir ran et al 2009 however the amount of retained nutrients only accounted for 6 4 and 8 of the total n p and si of the changjiang transported to the sea respectively ran et al 2009 when the tgr launched a 175 m experimental water storage in 2009 approximately 21 of tdn 24 of tp and 3 of dsi were retained in the tgr table 5 and the amount of retained nutrients accounted for 15 12 and 1 of the tdn tp and dsi fluxes in the estuary respectively comparing the historical data of nutrient fluxes in the datong fig 8 b it was found that the din flux decreased by 30 except in 2005 po4 3 flux fluctuated between 11 01 108 and 15 04 108 mol a and the dsi exhibited a u shaped distribution lower values appeared in 2006 when the impounded water level increased from 135 m in 2003 to 175 m in 2009 the tgr had been fully operational since 2010 with the water level fluctuating between 145 m from april to september and 175 m from october to mid april in 2010 2016 the average din and po4 3 fluxes in the datong respectively increased by 23 and 50 than that between 2003 and 2009 while the dsi fluctuated around 10 08 1010 mol a since 2010 fig 8b this suggested that the changes of dsi concentration after 2010 were not so significant mainly because the water discharged into the estuary was relatively stable dai et al 2011 in addition the accumulation of nutrients caused by plankton and sediment deposits in the reservoir did resulted in a corresponding reduction in the amount of biological elements transported from the changjiang to the east china sea however the storage capacity of tgr only accounted for 4 5 xu et al 2009 of the annual runoff of the changjiang coupled with the interception of the upstream reservoir group and the reduction of sediment entering the tgr etc huang et al 2014 such that the impact of tgr on the nutrient flux of the changjiang into the sea became very limited reduced suspended sediment discharge elevated nutrient concentrations e g din and po4 3 fig 8a and changes in the nutrient ratios were found in the estuary and adjacent seas because of the interception in the tgr and human disturbance in the middle and lower reaches of the changjiang gao et al 2008 the estuary and adjacent seas were likely to become eutrophic because of the changes of nutrient composition which resulted in the corresponding changes in the phytoplankton composition of the adjacent waters jiang et al 2014 dai et al 2011 reported that the decreasing dsi din ratio and the increasing din po4 3 ratio could cause more frequent red tide in the changjiang estuary the concentration of chl a in the estuary and adjacent sea area increased from 1 11 µg l in 2003 to 3 81 µg l in 2010 except for 2009 while dissolved oxygen decreased from 6 80 mg l in 2003 to 4 29 mg l in 2010 fig 9 but the historical data showed that the frequency and area of red tides in the ecs decreased significantly since 2003 and maintained a slight fluctuation after 2010 except for the red tide area in 2016 fig 9 in this study din po4 3 dsi din and dsi po4 3 ratios in river water entering the ecs decreased since 2003 and had no obvious correlations with the frequency and area of red tides in the ecs however it was found that the dsi r 0 889 n 7 p 0 01 and po4 3 r 0 893 n 7 p 0 01 transported by the changjiang had significant negative correlations with the area of red tides in the ecs while din did not this implies that after 2003 po4 3 and dsi transported by the changjiang may affected the occurrence of the red tides in addition it was also found that after 2003 po4 3 transported by the changjiang had positive correlations with chl a r 0 648 n 10 p 0 05 in the estuary and adjacent sea area indicating that the enrichment of po4 3 in the changjiang may promote the increase of chl a concentrations in the estuary so did tgr s storage affect the frequency and area of red tides in the ecs to a certain extent the assessment was rather difficult at present due to the lack of long term experimental data such as time series changes of nutrients in the mid downstream of the changjiang moreover the response of shallow lakes in the mid downstream on the scheduling model of tgr impoundment was not well understood meanwhile the interception of nutrients in the reservoir should have a seasonal and interannual variations therefore scientifically and comprehensively estimating the relationship between the ecological health of the ecs and the dispatching modes of tgr needed to rely on the accumulation and analysis of longer term data 5 conclusions this study focused on nutrient dynamics in the changjiang and retention effect in the tgr the changjiang is enriched with spm din and dsi depleted with respect to don po4 3 dop pop and bsi because of the impoundment don and dop concentrations increased from the inflow to the outflow of the tgr while other nutrients were on the contrary the higher pop near the estuary may have a potential impact on receiving coastal marine ecosystems based on input output mass balance model the retention of nutrients in the tgr were different dissolved nutrient retention was in the order of po4 3 31 2 din 23 5 dsi 2 8 approximately 3 42 104 t a dsi was assimilated by diatoms whereas 6 84 104 t a din and 4 28 103 t a po4 3 were assimilated by phytoplankton the retention of don and dop were lower in the tgr even tgr also served as a source of don in the river however tgr played an important role in the trapping of the incoming tpp 0 32 104 t a tpp and bsi 1 82 104 t a bsi which accounted for 30 8 and 34 3 of the total input loads respectively impoundment of the tgd affected the ecological health of the reservoir and estuary since 2003 nutrient status in the tgr was mainly mesotrophic but slight eutrophication significantly increased during 2005 2016 which implies that there was still a risk of algal blooms in the reservoir and tributaries moreover the estuary and adjacent seas were likely to become more eutrophic because of the retention of tgr on nutrients in the river and anthropogenic disturbance in the mid downstream nevertheless the outbreak frequency and area of the red tide in the ecs significantly decreased after 2003 in order to understand the effect of the operation mode of tgr on red tide in the ecs a longer time scale

and retention effect of the reservoir during the transitional period and the potential impact of the reservoir impoundment on the eutrophication of the tgr and estuary water samples were collected in the mainstream and tributaries of changjiang from august to october 2009 and june 2010 to analyze the concentrations of dissolved and particulate nutrients and suspended particulate matter spm the changjiang was enriched with dissolved inorganic nitrogen din dissolved silicate dsi and spm but depleted in po4 3 and biogenic silica bsi with higher din po4 3 and dsi po4 3 ratios din and po4 3 concentrations were lower in the jinshajiang but increased in the mid downstream of the changjiang due to high human activities and nutrients import from major tributaries dsi concentration varied little along the changjiang and was relatively low in the tgr particulate inorganic phosphorus pip total particulate phosphorus tpp and bsi concentrations were very high in the jinshajiang and then dramatically decreased with the spm in the tgr the northern tributaries contributed more nutrients to the changjiang than the southern tributaries depending on the nutrients input output mass balance model the retention of nutrients in the tgr were higher for tpp and bsi lower for dissolved organic nitrogen don and dissolved organic phosphorus dop total dissolved nitrogen tdn total phosphorus tp and dsi retained in the reservoir accounted for 15 12 and 1 respectively of the tdn tp and dsi fluxes in the datong station near the estuary historical data showed that the impoundment of the tgd greatly contributed to the eutrophication of the reservoir and estuary since 2003 algal blooms were likely to occur in the tgr estuary and adjacent seas but the outbreak frequency and area of red

observed in the estuaries and coastal marine ecosystems due to the delivery of river nutrients armon et al 2015 garnier et al 2010 romero et al 2013 the changjiang yangtze is the largest river flowing into the west pacific ocean with a drainage area of 1 8 106 km2 annual mean runoff of 9 0 1011 m3 and sediment load of 4 7 108 ton t fan et al 2014 li et al 2007 with growing populations and rapid industrialization in the changjiang basin anthropogenic activities including industrial discharge city sewage agricultural and domestic run off have increasingly led to water quality deterioration gao et al 2016 nitrogen and phosphorus as the essential nutrients that support aquatic primary productivity have exhibited remarkable upward trends in the changjiang over the past 50 years li et al 2007 and approximately 1 43 106 t of din including 1 28 106 t of nitrate no3 and 2 35 105 t of tp are annually transported to the ocean shen et al 2003 yan et al 2003 tong et al 2015 moreover about 3 17 106 t a of dsi is transported into the ecs liu and shen 2001 the three gorges dam tgd began to impound water and sediment discharge on 1st june 2003 when the tgd experimental storage water level reached 175 m in 2009 the water storage capacity of the tgr was 39 3 km3 about 4 5 of the changjiang s annual discharge xu et al 2009 although the amount of sediment transported by the changjiang has gradually decreased due to the construction of the tgd the amount of water entering the sea has not decreased significantly but basically maintained at 9 0 1011 m3 over the past 50 years dai et al 2011 the tgr has been reported to have influenced nutrient and freshwater discharges of the changjiang leading to reduction of primary productivity abnormal salinity and changes in other ecological parameters such as reduction of heterotrophic bacteria in the changjiang estuary and coastal area gong et al 2006 yan et al 2008 jiao et al 2007 so it is very urgent to study the long term effects of the tgd operational mode on the ecosystems of reservoir estuary and ecs 2009 2010 is a critical period for tgr s transition from staged impoundment to full operation at this stage studying the nutrients composition of the changjiang and the nutrients retention in the tgr will have a key guiding significance for nutrients transport from the changjiang to the ecs as well as for the eutrophication of the tgr and estuary under the full operation of the reservoir since 2010 but at present most of the researches have focused on the changes of nutrients huang et al 2014 lou et al

estuarine ecosystems etc chai et al 2009 jiang et al 2014 zhou et al 2008 before and after tgr impoundment few studies have focused on the nutrients in the entire changjiang basin and nutrients retention in the tgr during this transitional period since 2003 the long term potential impact of the tgr impoundment on eutrophication of the reservoir estuary and ecs is rarely known based on the observations in 2009 2010 this study aims to provide a deeper and systematic understanding of nutrient dynamics and biogeochemistry in the changjiang the box model is used to estimate the retention effect of tgr on nutrients in the river combined with the historical data of the reservoir and estuary the potential impacts of the tgr staged storage in 2003 2009 and normal storage since 2010 on the eutrophication of reservoir estuary and ecs are further evaluated in order to provide a certain historical and theoretical basis for the coordination between the tgr regulation model and sustainable ecological health of the estuary in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the changjiang extends over 6300 km from its headwaters in the qinghai tibet plateau to the east china sea generally the area from the source to yichang in hubei is defined as the upstream of the changjiang it is 4500 km long with a basin area of 1 0 106 km2 fig 1 the midstream 955 km long is the reach from yichang to hukou hk in jiangxi and the downstream segment is defined as the reach from hukou to the changjiang estuary shanghai the tgd is located about 44 km upstream of yichang fig 1 the jinshajiang lies on the upper stream of the changjiang which is the region of 3000 6300 km from the river mouth some tributaries such as yalongjiang ylj minjiang mj jialingjiang jlj tuojiang tj fujiang fj daduhe ddh and hanjiang hj are in the north other tributaries including wujiang wj niulanjiang nlj and chishuihe csh are in the south in addition the dongting lake dtl connecting the xiangjiang xj yuanjiang yj and zishui zs and the poyang lake pyl connecting the ganjiang gj and fuhe fh are located in the south of the main channel the sampling stations are shown in fig 1 2 2 sample collection from august to october 2009 and june 2010 water samples in the mainstream and tributaries of the changjiang were collected with 20 l niskin bottles at three different depths surface intermediate and near bottom at each station dissolved nutrient samples were filtered in situ using 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membranes that had been pre soaked for 24 h with 1 1000 hcl and then washed to neutral ph with milli q water the filtrates were preserved by the addition of saturated hgcl2 on return to the laboratory the filters were dried at 50 c for 72 h and reweighed to determine the mass of spm spm was analyzed for pip tpp and bsi 2 3 chemical analyses nutrients no3 no2 and dsi were analyzed using an autoanalyzer skalar sanplus system liu et al 2012 po4 3 was measured manually by phosphomolyb denum blue method grasshoff et al 1999 nh4 was measured manually by sodium hypobromite oxidation method gao et al 1980 tdn and tdp were measured using alkaline potassium persulfate oxidation method grasshoff et al 1999 the analytical precision was 0 06 μmol l for no3 0 01 μmol l for no2 0 15 μmol l for dsi 0 03 μmol l for po4 3 0 09 μmol l for nh4 0 68 μmol l for tdn and 0 02 μmol l for tdp din concentration was the sum of no3 no2 and nh4 don and dissolved organic phosphorus dop were the difference between tdn and din and between tdp and po4 3 respectively spm was ashed at 550 c for 2 h and then was extracted with hcl 1 m 16 h for tpp analysis aspila et al 1976 pip was determined by extraction of uncombusted samples for 16 h in 1 m hcl aspila et al 1976 pop was the difference between tpp and pip tp was the sum of tpp and tdp the analytical precision was 0 5 for pip and tpp n 5 bsi was measured in our laboratory with modifications to the methods of ragueneau et al 2005 briefly spm was subjected to three steps digestion 0 2 m naoh ph 13 3 at 100 c for 40 min in the first and second leach all the bsi was converted into si oh 4 si and al concentrations si 1 al 1 si 2 and al 2 in the supernatant were analyzed in the third leach after the filter was rinsed and dried the si al 3 ratio of silicate minerals present in the spm was determined so the corrected bsi concentration was given by bsi si 1 si 2 al 1 al 2 si 3 al 3 here the al concentration was determined by the modified aluminum fluorescent gallium al lmg complex fluorescence spectrophotometry ren et al 2001 hydes and liss 1976 the analytical precision was 5 for bsi 2 4 nutrient budgets for the tgr and data source as shown in fig 1 there are three major input rivers in the upstream of the tgr including the changjiang mainstream jialingjiang and wujiang han et al 2016 it was reported that the sum water flux of the three upstream input rivers accounted for 90 8 of the total water flux of the tgr wang et al 2009 therefore fuling is regarded as the control station of three major input rivers entering the tgr in this study a box model is adopted to estimate the nutrient input output mass balance for the tgr fig 2 ran et al 2013 2015 it is hypothesized that the total input to the reservoir including the upstream inflow at the fuling the lateral input from the sub catchment of the tgr urban domestic sewage industrial and agricultural pollution and atmospheric deposition must be equal to the losses including the output at the dam yichang and the reservoir retention the equation is as follows 1 l i l t l p l d l s l o l r where li represents the upstream nutrients input load of tgr including the changjiang mainstream jialingjiang and wujiang lt represents the lateral nutrients input load from the sub catchment of the tgr here to avoid the pseudo retention effect caused by freshwater discharge difference the water discharge of the lateral input is the difference between upstream inflow and downstream outflow of the tgr kelly 2001 ran et al 2013 lp represents the industrial and agricultural pollution load ls represents urban domestic sewage lp and ls only considers

retention of the reservoir data sources are shown in table 2 the retention efficiency is considered as a parameter to evaluate and identify the retention effect of the dam or reservoir on nutrients

features fig 3 a showed that the changjiang carried a large volume of water to the east china sea during the study period an increasing trend was observed within the main channel from the upper to lower reaches at the upstream hydrographic station of fuling the monthly average water flow between 2009 and 2010 respectively exceeded 509 108 and 323 108 m3 due to the inflow from several large tributaries including the yalongjiang minjiang jialingjiang and wujiang table 1 after the tgd the monthly mean water discharge at yichang in august to october 2009 was comparable to that at fuling however in june 2010 the water discharge at the yichang increased by 44 than that at fuling fig 3a table 1 and then the monthly mean water discharge respectively increased to 812 108 and 1305 108 m3 at datong after the inflow from the hanjiang and dongting lake connecting zishui yuanjiang and xiangjiang and poyang lake connecting ganjiang and fuhe table 1 in addition the mean water discharge in the mid downstream section increased by 39 60 in 2010 than in 2009 from the impact of concentrated heavy rainfall during the study period wang 2010 the spm concentrations had a significant negative correlation p 0 05 r 0 816 n 8 with water discharge along the changjiang the spm concentrations varied between 4 49 and 534 mg l with an average of 124 mg l in the main channel a decreasing trend was observed within the main channel from the upper to middle reaches fig 3b in 2009 spm concentration decreased to 33 7 mg l at fuling due to the deposition of suspended particulate matter and the dilution of water discharge after the tgd spm concentration at yichang 22 3 mg l decreased by 34 compared to that at fuling then slowly increased to 50 3 mg l at datong besides the concentrations of spm from datong station to the estuary in 2010 were significantly higher than that in 2009 due to heavy rainfall fig 3b 3 2 spatial patterns of nutrient concentrations in the mainstream of the changjiang the distributions of nh4 and no2 were similar to each other fig s1 d and c the average level of nh4 and no2 accounted for 5 4 and 0 7 of tdn respectively in 2009 the nutrient concentrations in the upper reaches slowly increased to 6 69 µmol l for nh4 and 0 90 µmol l for no2 at fuling and then decreased to 1 07 µmol l for nh4 and 0 15 µmol l for no2 at yichang respectively in the middle reaches the concentrations of nh4 and no2 increased by one order of magnitude than those in the upper reaches further downstream the nutrient concentrations decreased to fairly stabilization in the region of 350 700 km from the river mouth and then the average level respectively increased to 8 12 µmol l for nh4 and 1 06 µmol l for no2 in the area 0 300 km from the estuary no3 din and tdn had a similar tendency figs 4 a s1a and b the nutrient concentrations were quite low in the jinshajiang with averages of 29 2 µmol l for no3 30 3 µmol l for din and 35 9 µmol l for tdn respectively and increased significantly to 135 µmol l for no3 142 µmol l for din and 152 µmol l for tdn at fuling respectively subsequently decreased to 97 5 µmol l for no3 98 3 µmol l for din and 112 µmol l for tdn at fengjie respectively further mid downstream no3 concentration basically remained stable except in the region of 300 km from the river mouth in 2009 fig 4a however din and tdn concentrations slightly increased in the midstream and decreased to fairly stable in the downstream with a similar tendency to nitrate fig s1 a and b no3 was the main form of nitrogen in the changjiang accounting for 84 1 of tdn fig s1 a also indicated that the average concentration of inorganic n in the tributaries of changjiang was significantly higher than that of the main stream including the jialingjiang minjiang tuojiang and hanjiang in the north and wujiang in the south while the inorganic n concentration in the yalongjiang was the lowest in all tributaries the average don concentration fig s1e was relatively high compared with that of nh4 and no2 which accounted for 9 8 of tdn the concentration ranged from 0 65 to 17 13 µmol l with an average of 7 23 µmol l in the mainstream the don concentration was rather low in the upper reaches significantly increased to 12 43 µmol l by average in the tgr and decreased further in the mid downstream except for the region of 500 700 km from the estuary meanwhile the average concentration of don in the mid downstream of the changjiang in 2009 was almost three times that of 2010 fig s1e in the main stream of the changjiang the distribution of po4 3 fig 4b was similar to that of tdp fig s1f po4 3 averagely accounted for 73 3 of tdp and 35 4 of tp respectively like no3 din and tdn po4 3 concentrations were quite low in the jinshajiang with an average of 0 21 µmol l and increased by a factor of more than 10 in the tgr decreased to lower value after the tgd and then slightly increased to stable concentrations basically in the mid downstream in 2009 fig 4b but in 2010 there was a large fluctuation for po4 3 concentrations in the midstream dop was considered to be a smaller part of the tdp about 26 7 the dop concentration ranged from 0 19 to 1 19 µmol l with an average of 0 61 µmol l in the mainstream the dop concentration decreased significantly in the area 4100 3200 km from the river mouth increased to the highest value at fuling probably due to the effect of the tributaries such as the yalongjiang daduhe and minjiang fig s1g and gradually decreased in the mid downstream in the lower reaches of the changjiang the average dop concentration in 2010 was twice that in 2009 the concentrations of pip and tpp varied from 0 22 to 9 50 µmol l and 0 32 to 13 36 µmol l with averages of 2 05 µmol l and 2 69 µmol l in the main channel respectively the average pip and tpp concentrations in the upstream of tgr in 2009 were 5 7 times as high as that of the middle and lower reaches of the changjiang and reached the lowest values with 0 43 and 0 66 µmol l in the tgr respectively figs s1 i and 4c in 2010 pip and tpp concentrations in the mid downstream were lower than those in 2009 besides in the region of 2400 4200 km from the river mouth pip and tpp concentrations in the tributaries were significantly lower p 0 01 than that in the mainstream like dop the pop was also considered to be an important fraction of the tpp pop averagely accounted for 24 0 of tpp and 12 4 of tp pop concentrations were between 0 04 and 3 86 µmol l with an average of 0 65 µmol l in the mainstream the average concentrations of pop and pip in the mid downstream in 2010 were smaller compared with 2009 fig s1j and i the concentrations of tp were between 1 51 and 14 67 µmol l on average of 4 87 µmol l in the main channel its concentrations in 2009 were quite higher in a region of 2400 4200 km from the river mouth decreased by a factor of about 3 in the tgr increased in the midstream due to the inflow of hanjiang and then decreased gradually in the downstream fig s1h the average tp concentration in the northern tributaries was almost 2 times higher than that in the southern the concentration of particulate p pp in the jinshajiang was significantly higher than that of dissolved p 1µmol l and pp accounted for more than 85 95 of tp dsi concentration ranged from 70 8 to 127 µmol l with an average of 105 µmol l in the mainstream the average concentration of dsi in the mid downstream was almost similar to that in the upstream fig 4d the average concentration of silicate in the northern tributaries was comparable to that of the southern tributaries but somewhat higher than that of the mainstream of the changjiang the bsi concentrations were between 0 11 and 29 4 µmol l with an average of 11 07 µmol l in the changjiang the average concentration of bsi was relative high in a region of 2400 4200 km from the estuary decreased by a factor of 3 in the tgr increased to the maximum value of 13 24 µmol l and then decreased at the lower reaches of changjiang in 2009 fig 4e in 2010 the bsi concentration in the downstream was significantly higher than that of the midstream p 0 01 fig 4e in addition the distribution of bsi in 2010 was closely related to that of spm r 0 685 n 43 p 0 01 in 2009 the concentrations of bsi in most of the tributaries were lower than that of the mainstream of the changjiang fig 4e 3 3 nutrient fluxes and areal yields nutrient fluxes in the main channel and main tributaries were calculated as follows ran et al 2013 2015 3 f load c q where fload is the monthly flux of nutrients c is the average concentration of nutrients and q is the monthly average freshwater discharge at the hydrological control station table 1 the monthly yields of nutrients were estimated based on the average monthly fluxes of nutrients and drainage area liu et al 2009 the monthly fluxes and area yields of nutrient in the changjiang mainstream and its main tributaries in 2009 are shown in tables 3 and 4 affected by the monthly average water discharge along the changjiang the fluxes of no3 din and tdn increased from the upstream to the mouth in the mainstream p 0 01 except at the huangshi where the values of din and tdn fluxes were higher due to higher fluxes of nh4 and no2 table 3 however the changes of don flux in the mainstream were controlled by both concentration and water discharge p 0 01 table 3 additionally no3 din and tdn yields from upstream to huangshi had increased significantly by a factor of 4 than that in upstream and no3 yield remained relatively stable from huangshi to yangzhou table 4 although the monthly mean fluxes of nh4 and no2 in tributaries were much lower than those in mainstream their monthly yields were about 1 4 times higher than that of mainstream tables 3 and 4 the don yields increased by more than 6 times from the upper to the wuhu but decreased sharply in the yangzhou table 4 the average don yields in the tributaries were comparable to that of the main stream affected by the changes of water discharge along the changjiang the monthly fluxes of po4 3 and tdp were much lower in the upstream and increased significantly in the mid downstream but the dop fluxes were relative low in the upstream increased rapidly from the jiangjin to wuhu and then decreased suddenly in the yangzhou table 3 dop inputs to mainstream from the yalongjiang and minjiang were estimated to be respectively 1 38 107 and 2 15 107 mol month which had important impact on the fluxes of dop in the upstream besides the average yields of po4 3 and tdp increased first and then gradually stabilized from the upstream to downstream table 4 and the average yields of po4 3 and tdp were comparable in the northern and southern tributaries and were almost twice that of the mainstream table 4 however dop yields decreased at jiangjin in the upstream increased to the highest value at yichang and significantly decreased in the mid downstream table 4 all dop yields in the tributaries were higher than those in the mainstream except for hanjiang and wujiang table 4 in contrast the fluxes of pip pop tpp and tp in the mainstream were more affected by concentration p 0 01 their fluxes increased from the upstream to jiangjin sharply decreased at the yichang and then increased in the lower reaches table 3 meanwhile the trend of their yields were similar to their fluxes table 4 interestingly their maximum fluxes and yields were closely related to the particulate matter in the jiangjin area where concentration of spm was the highest fig 3b besides the fluxes of pip pop tpp and tp in all the tributaries were less than those in the mainstream table 3 the dsi flux increased from the upstream to the mouth but bsi flux increased to 54 3 107 mol month at jiangjin sharply decreased to 16 0 107 mol month at the yichang and then increased in the mid downstream table 3 the fluxes of dsi and bsi in all the tributaries were less than those in the mainstream besides silicate yields were rather low in the upstream and then increased by a factor of 0 6 from the yichang to yangzhou table 4 the bsi yields in the upstream were significantly higher than that of the mid downstream interestingly bsi yields was the lowest at the yichang after the tgd table 4 however the dsi yields in all tributaries were at least 1 3 times than that of the mainstream except for hanjiang and wujiang table 4 the monthly average bsi yield of the tributaries was 45 of that of the mainstream table 4 3 4 nutrients retention of the tgr in 2009 the monthly average water discharge at zhutuo beibei wulong which are the control sections in the changjiang mainstream jialingjiang wujiang and yichang accounted for 15 7 16 8 6 8 and 12 9 of the annual average water discharge respectively during the survey period in 2009 table 1 because of seasonal changes of the nutrient concentrations and water discharge in the reservoir the retention of nutrients in the tgr also had obvious seasonality therefore in order to avoid the pseudo retention effect caused by freshwater discharge difference the annual retention load and efficiency of nutrients in the tgr in 2009 were further estimated although there is great uncertainty in this estimate and difficulty in assessing the uncertainty the estimation lay a good theoretical foundation and data support for evaluating the response of nutrients in the changjiang to the operation scheme of tgr in the future the total inflow load of din and tdn were 77 29 104 t a and 83 25 104 t a respectively in which about 91 of the din and tdn input came from the upstream of the tgr and approximately 6 of this input came from the lateral load from the sub catchment of the tgr the total outflow load of din and tdn were 59 16 104 t a and 65 56 104 t a respectively so din and tdn retained in the tgr would be 23 5 and 21 2 of the total inflow load respectively table 5 however total don input load 5 96 104 t a was significantly lower than the total output load 6 41 104 t a about 0 45 104 t a of don was produced in the tgr which accounted for 7 5 of the total inflow load table 5 po4 3 was the main tdp retained in the tgr and accounted for 61 9 of the retained tdp load the retention of dop 1 4 observed was clearly lower than that of po4 3 31 2 table 5 the input 10 36 103 t a and output 10 21 103 t a loads of dop were comparable which showed that the retention of dop in the reservoir was relatively weak the differences between input and output load of tdp and tpp were 7 66 103 t a and 3 21 103 t a respectively this differences accounted for 22 2 and 30 8 of the tdp and tpp inflow loads respectively the retention of tpp was obvious however tdp retained in the tgr was dominant which was about 70 5 of the retained tp table 5 the total inflow load of dsi from the upstream and lateral input of the tgr was 122 84 104 t a tables 1 and 2 in which approximately 92 of dsi input came from the upstream of tgr the total outflow load of dsi was 119 42 104 t a thus 3 42 104 t a of dsi was retained by the tgr which accounted for 2 8 of the total inflow load table 5 the bsi inflow and outflow load were respectively 5 31 104 and 3 49 104 t a tables 1 and 2 for bsi approximately 1 82 104 t a was trapped by the tgr which accounted for 34 3 of the total inflow load table 5 obviously the retention of bsi was higher than that of dsi but the retained bsi accounted for 34 7 of retained total silicon bsi dsi in the tgr and bsi bsi dsi decreased from 4 1 at the inflow to 2 8 at the outflow this indicated that dsi was the main contributor to total silicon retained in the tgr 4 discussion 4 1 biogeochemistry of nutrients in the river nutrient levels showed a wide range of variation along the changjiang generally the excess din was derived from intense anthropogenic activities such as municipal sewage discharge extensive agricultural land leaching and aquaculture water discharge etc liu et al 2011 most previous studies e g shen et al 2003 hao et al 2006 yan et al 2010 indicated that n fertilizer was the main source of din in the changjiang from the 1970s to 1990s however the growth rate of n fertilizer application dropped significantly after 2000 and domestic sewage a major din source had dramatically driven up din loads in the changjiang from 2000 to 2010 xu et al 2013 in this study the mean level of din 100 8 µmol l fig s1a in the changjiang was comparable with those reported for polluted waters 110 µmol l smith et al 2003 and pearl river 113 8 µmol l less than those in the yellow river 318 4 µmol l but higher than those in the mississippi atchafalaya river 94 5 µmol l congo river 14 8 µmol l amazon river 10 4 µmol l yenisey river 26 0 µmol l and mekong river 12 6 µmol l table 6 po4 3 1 57 µmol l concentrations in the changjiang were higher than those in the yellow river 0 38 µmol l and pearl river 0 70 µmol l but lower than those in the mississippi atchafalaya river 2 50 µmol l nile 2 40 µmol l and congo river 2 20 µmol l table 6 however po4 3 concentrations had a significant negative correlation with the concentrations of spm p 0 01 due to abundant spm average of 124 mg l in the chanjiang po4 3 was easily adsorbed by the suspended particulates liu et al 2009 besides dsi in rivers was mainly released from phytolith dissolution and silicate weathering ma et al 2017 the weathering was constrained by the interaction of tectonic activities rock type and climate liu et al 2011 during the study period the mean level of dsi 104 8 µmol l in the mainstream was comparable to that of the yellow river 108 8 µmol l mississippi atchafalaya river 108 0 µmol l amazon 117 6 µmol l and congo river 115 8 µmol l and much lower than that of the mekong river 245 5 µmol l table 6 therefore the changjiang was enriched with din and dsi and depleted with respect to po4 3 with very high din po4 3 43 356 and dsi po4 3 29 1281 molar ratios while the dsi din ratios was in the range of 0 52 3 94 fig 5 a b and c according to the critical ratios of redfield et al 1963 and justic et al 1995 changjiang still is potentially p limited which is similar to previous studies liu et al 2016 froelich 1988 suggested that the adsorption of po4 3 by particles proceeds via a two step mechanism the first involving rapid po4 3 adsorption desorption at the particle surface and the second involving slow solid state diffusion of the adsorbed po4 3 from the surface of the particle to the interior so the kd partitioning coefficient given as kd p c where p µmol g and c µmol l are the particulate and dissolved concentrations respectively approach can be used to quantify the partitioning of p between the particle and dissolved phase and the evaluation of its particle reactivity fang et al 2000 the logkd values for inorganic p in the mainstream of the changjiang ranged from 0 48 to 2 31 with an average of 1 12 which were obviously less than the value 4 80 in the pearl river estuary 4 59 in the humber estuary and 4 62 in the amazon estuary li et al 2017 prastka et al 1994 in 2009 the logkd values in the mainstream significantly decreased in the upstream 2400 4200 km from the river mouth and then remained around 1 in the downstream where concentrations of spm were between 22 29 and 72 73 mg l fig 6 a it has been demonstrated that the kd values exhibited an inverse relationship with spm 20 mg l and remained fairly constant when the spm concentration was higher than 20 mg l li et al 2017 fang 2000 therefore the dependence of phosphate particle dissolved interactions on spm decreased in the mid downstream with high spm concentrations 20 mg l during the survey period the changjiang was depleted with don dop and pop fig s1e g and j dissolved organic nutrients were less bioavailable than dissolved inorganic forms cotner and wetzel 1992 but dop and po4 3 may be used by the phytoplankton huang et al 2005 although microbial n uptake was generally dominated by din especially nh4 don both urea and dissolved free amino acids also served as an important n source and could fueled bacterial production and remineralization veuger et al 2004 pomeroy 1974 in the present study don concentrations in the region before the tgd were higher than that in the upstream of the tgr fig s1e and might contribute to the composition of the microbial plankton community in the region before the tgd besides in the case of phosphate limitation in the water column microorganisms may obtain phosphate by utilizing alkaline phosphatase activity apa to degrade organic phosphorus pop or dop compounds artigas et al 2012 in 2009 pop dop l g in the mainstream increased along the river and reached to the highest value in the estuary fig 6a which could promote apa synthesis of particle attached microorganisms dyhrman et al 2006 and apa degraded pop to produce po4 3 into the water may have a potential impact on receiving coastal marine ecosystems the value of tpp tp decreased by 66 from the upstream to the tgr and the concentration of tp also decreased by 61 which indicated that the particulate phosphorus was the major type of component among the phosphorus species in the upstream tpp tp 90 ding et al 2010 huang et al 2014 in addition the average level of spm decreased by 93 from the upstream to the tgr fig 3b which further indicated that pp accompanied with spm was intercepted and retained in the tgr even during the flood season in 2017 the tgr trapped nearly 76 of spm and 75 of pp tang et al 2018 the main sources of bsi in aquatic ecosystems were the erosion input of terrestrial ecosystems and the production of phytoplankton ma et al 2017 the average bsi concentrations in the changjiang were 11 07 µmol l lower than that of the rhine river 23 40 µmol l amazon river 73 90 µmol l and yellow river 40 20 µmol l but slightly higher than that of the congo river 9 70 µmol l table 6 obviously the bsi level in the changjiang was at a low level in the world s rivers average 28 00 µmol l conley 1997 4 2 nutrients retention in the tgr the retention efficiency of din and tdn in the tgr were 23 5 and 21 2 respectively table 5 in the present study no3 tdn at yichang 89 3 was compared to that at fuling 88 6 fig 4a but no2 tdn and nh4 tdn at yichang respectively decreased by 81 and 80 compared with that of fuling fig s1c and d while don tdn increased by 52 table 2 this implies that the composition of nitrogen in the tgr had changed because of the reservoir effect generally when reactive n enters the reservoir it would be faced with a variety of potential fates such as nitrification denitrification burial uptake by aquatic plants eg diatoms and adsorption on particulates etc harrison et al 2009 wang et al 2010 the reduction of nh4 and no2 at yichang may partly be as a result of algal assimilation to produce don sun et al 2013 therefore based on our mass balance calculation tgr served as a don source in the river table 5 besides denitrification at the surface sediments was considered to be the main mechanism of nitrogen removal in the reservoir but n removal via denitrification was much lower in the main stream of the changjiang before the construction of the tgd yan et al 2004 if denitrification in the tgr was estimated based on 7 16 of total input tdn load 8 32 105 t in the reservoirs at the global scale seitzinger et al 2006 after the full operation of the tgr 33 75 of retained tdn table 5 would be removed via denitrification furthermore according to the denitrification and the surface area of tgr 1080 km2 xu et al 2011 the denitrification rate 54 123 g n m 2 a 1 would be similar to the observed 108 g n m 2 a 1 in lake shelbyville illinois u s a david et al 2006 where the no3 content was comparable to that of the tgr however although longer residence time accelerated denitrification it was difficult to evaluate the strength of denitrification depending on our available data the retention efficiency of po4 3 and tdp in the tgr were 31 2 and 22 2 table 5 respectively like nitrogen the composition of phosphorus changed significantly due to the reservoir effect of the tgr in particular dop tp increased from 17 7 at fuling to 30 0 at yichang while po4 3 tp decreased from 54 9 at fuling to 48 7 at yichang table 2 meanwhile diatom was observed to be the dominant algae species in the tgr during the study period yang et al 2012 therefore the growth of diatom lowered the po4 3 concentration and increased the dop concentration in the tgr in order to study the uptake of po4 3 by phytoplankton in reservoirs we made the following estimates a primary production model canfield et al 1981 output showed that primary production in the tgr was 350 g c m 2 a 1 with a range of 262 5 437 5 g c m 2 a 1 zhang et al 1999 here we proposed a way of estimating fixed po4 3 flux using the typical c p ratio of 106 1 for phytoplankton assimilation redfield et al 1963 the model output showed that the potential primary production in the tgr would be 0 21 0 34 mol m 2 a 1 which corresponded to a total annual po4 3 fixation of 6 91 103 11 52 103 t a taking into account the surface area of 1080 km2 at the water level of 175 m after the impoundment of tgr in fact 7 52 103 t a of po4 3 table 5 was retained in the tgr based on our mass balance calculation in addition the retention mechanism of phosphorus in the reservoir was mainly based on the sedimentation of pp kennedy et al 1990 in this study the retention efficiency of tpp 30 8 was significantly higher than that of tdp 22 2 and 3 21 103 t a of tpp was trapped in the tgr which accounted for 30 of tp load retained in the tgr table 5 as discussed in section 4 1 the retention of pp in the reservoir was closely related to the sedimentation of particulate matters when the impounded water level increased from 135 m in 2003 to 175 m in 2010 the deposition of particulate matters in the tgr dramatically increased from 12 40 million tons in 2003 to 19 60 million tons in 2010 changjiang water resource commission 2000 2016 therefore impoundment to 175 m obviously engendered a considerably large amount of particulate matters as well as pp deposition in the tgr tang et al 2018 after the full operation of the tgd lower flow velocity prolonged residence time high transparency and high nutrient levels excess n and p stimulated the growth of phytoplankton especially diatoms yang et al 2012 diatoms i e biological uptake dsi and conversion to bsi were more likely to be deposited than other planktonic algae and the lower dissolution rate of bsi siliceous shell limited the regeneration of silicon resulting in the removal of silicon in the reservoir humborg et al 2006 additionally silicon fixation in the tgr was estimated from the primary production model canfield et al 1981 zhang et al 1999 total primary productivity had been described above in detail here a way of estimating fixed dsi flux was proposed by using the typical c si ratio of 106 16 for phytoplankton assimilation redfield et al 1963 the primary productivity of diatoms can be calculated by using the ratio of diatom primary productivity to total primary productivity which is usually 1 2 in freshwater ecosystems chinese encyclopedia compilation committee 1987 therefore the model output showed that the total annual dsi fixation was 4 99 104 8 32 104 t a taking into account the surface area of 1080 km2 at the water level of 175 m after the impoundment of tgr in fact 3 42 104 t a dsi was trapped in the reservoir based on our mass balance calculation which indicates that the retained dsi may be all assimilated by diatoms consequently based on the typical n p si ratio of 16 1 16 for phytoplankton assimilation redfield et al 1963 6 84 104 t a din and 4 28 103 t a po4 3 were assimilated by phytoplankton according to our mass balance estimates the retention of nutrients in the tgr varied during the three staged impoundment table 5 when the first impoundment to 135 m the retention of din 1 7 2005 in the tgr had no obvious changes compared with that 1 9 1997 before the impoundment subsequently the intercept of din increased from 1 7 in 2005 135 m to 8 9 in 2007 156 m and 23 5 in 2009 175 m however the retention of po4 3 had no statistical significance at different water levels moreover the tgr had a relatively small retention of dsi and even acted as a source of dsi table 5 and the retention of dsi in the tgr at the pre and post impoundment were far lower than the level 18 19 in reservoirs of the global river basins beusen et al 2009 normally nutrient loads were mainly controlled by water discharge based on the above assumptions detail in section 2 4 the annual average water discharge of the lateral input in 1997 2005 2007 and 2009 was 12 1 12 6 10 7 and 9 4 of total inflow of tgr respectively if these estimates subtracted the annual water discharges from 11 tributaries more than 100 tributaries in the tgr whose drainage area are more than 1500 km2 http www cqwater gov cn these differences in 1997 2005 2007 and 2009 would account for 6 1 7 8 5 2 and 3 5 of total inflow of tgr respectively these estimates were considered valid in this study additionally monthly averages of nutrients were used as annual averages in the estimates due to limited data availability thus there were some uncertainties in this estimate the most obvious feature was the operational state of the reservoir the data of nutrient concentrations in 2005 and 2007 mainly came from april to may when the reservoir was in the discharge stage but the concentrations in 2009 were mainly obtained in september october when the reservoir was in the impoundment stage in these different stages of operation not only the hydrology had obvious changes such as water level changjiang sediment bulletin but other parameters such as temperature chl a dissolved oxygen ph and algae distribution also had significant changes zeng et al 2006a therefore these uncertainties must be improved in future work 4 3 effect of impoundment on eutrophication in the tgr the impoundment of the tgr had changed the original hydrodynamic conditions of the river the most obvious feature was the slow flow velocity in the reservoir when the tgr impoundment reached the height of 175 m the average water flow rate decreased to 0 09 2 43 m s which was much lower than that 3 5 m s observed in natural changjiang channels tang et al 2018 china national environmental monitoring centre 1998 2017 the reduced flow rate led to longer water retention time during 2003 2009 monthly residence time of the tgr mainstream ranged from 5 to 77 d day with an average of 27 d while that for xiangxi bay a tributary of tgr was 26 538 d with an average of 179 d xu et al 2011 obviously monthly residence time was often shorter in the mainstream than in the tributaries accordingly the reduced water flow would also result in the settlement of spm and the increase of water transparency in the reservoir and tributaries however the sedimentation of spm in the changjiang was closely related to deposition of tpp r 0 966 n 46 p 0 01 so with the decrease of spm fig 3b the ratio of tdp tpp in reservoir would increase fig 6b changing the partitioning of p between the dissolved and particle phase in addition the level of nutrients in the tgr and tributaries had exceeded the internationally recognized threshold of eutrophication tn 14 29 µmol l tp 0 65 µmol l thomann et al 1987 therefore under suitable temperature and light intensity algal blooms would occur in the reservoir and its tributaries zhang et al 2012 historical data showed that since 2003 the impoundment of tgr resulted in the water eutrophication in the tgr and its tributaries china national environmental monitoring centre 1998 2017 not only the sensitive period for the occurrence of algal bloom extended from march july in 2004 to march october after 2007 but the number of tributaries affected by algal blooms also increased from 3 in 2003 to 11 22 after 2009 tang et al 2018 more importantly the trophic status of the tgr was mainly mesotrophic with the average proportion of 68 but the proportion of slight eutrophication significantly increased from 10 in 2005 to 27 in 2010 and fluctuated between 22 and 27 after 2010 except for 2011 fig 7 china national environmental monitoring centre 1998 2017 this implies that there was a risk of algal outbreaks in the reservoir and tributaries in addition the species composition of phytoplankton in the mainstream of the tgr was basically the same before and after the impoundment and diatoms green algae and cyanobacteria were the main species observed from 1999 to 2008 by qiu et al 2011 4 4 the influence of the tgr on nutrient transports in the estuary and its ecological significance as a typical reservoir of sediment retaining and no water retaining the tgr played a major role in the interception of nutrients transported from the upper reaches to the middle and lower reaches of the changjiang xu et al 2009 after the impoundment of the tgr reached 135 m in 2003 about 18 of tn 15 of tp and 20 of dsi were trapped in the reservoir ran et al 2009 however the amount of retained nutrients only accounted for 6 4 and 8 of the total n p and si of the changjiang transported to the sea respectively ran et al 2009 when the tgr launched a 175 m experimental water storage in 2009 approximately 21 of tdn 24 of tp and 3 of dsi were retained in the tgr table 5 and the amount of retained nutrients accounted for 15 12 and 1 of the tdn tp and dsi fluxes in the estuary respectively comparing the historical data of nutrient fluxes in the datong fig 8 b it was found that the din flux decreased by 30 except in 2005 po4 3 flux fluctuated between 11 01 108 and 15 04 108 mol a and the dsi exhibited a u shaped distribution lower values appeared in 2006 when the impounded water level increased from 135 m in 2003 to 175 m in 2009 the tgr had been fully operational since 2010 with the water level fluctuating between 145 m from april to september and 175 m from october to mid april in 2010 2016 the average din and po4 3 fluxes in the datong respectively increased by 23 and 50 than that between 2003 and 2009 while the dsi fluctuated around 10 08 1010 mol a since 2010 fig 8b this suggested that the changes of dsi concentration after 2010 were not so significant mainly because the water discharged into the estuary was relatively stable dai et al 2011 in addition the accumulation of nutrients caused by plankton and sediment deposits in the reservoir did resulted in a corresponding reduction in the amount of biological elements transported from the changjiang to the east china sea however the storage capacity of tgr only accounted for 4 5 xu et al 2009 of the annual runoff of the changjiang coupled with the interception of the upstream reservoir group and the reduction of sediment entering the tgr etc huang et al 2014 such that the impact of tgr on the nutrient flux of the changjiang into the sea became very limited reduced suspended sediment discharge elevated nutrient concentrations e g din and po4 3 fig 8a and changes in the nutrient ratios were found in the estuary and adjacent seas because of the interception in the tgr and human disturbance in the middle and lower reaches of the changjiang gao et al 2008 the estuary and adjacent seas were likely to become eutrophic because of the changes of nutrient composition which resulted in the corresponding changes in the phytoplankton composition of the adjacent waters jiang et al 2014 dai et al 2011 reported that the decreasing dsi din ratio and the increasing din po4 3 ratio could cause more frequent red tide in the changjiang estuary the concentration of chl a in the estuary and adjacent sea area increased from 1 11 µg l in 2003 to 3 81 µg l in 2010 except for 2009 while dissolved oxygen decreased from 6 80 mg l in 2003 to 4 29 mg l in 2010 fig 9 but the historical data showed that the frequency and area of red tides in the ecs decreased significantly since 2003 and maintained a slight fluctuation after 2010 except for the red tide area in 2016 fig 9 in this study din po4 3 dsi din and dsi po4 3 ratios in river water entering the ecs decreased since 2003 and had no obvious correlations with the frequency and area of red tides in the ecs however it was found that the dsi r 0 889 n 7 p 0 01 and po4 3 r 0 893 n 7 p 0 01 transported by the changjiang had significant negative correlations with the area of red tides in the ecs while din did not this implies that after 2003 po4 3 and dsi transported by the changjiang may affected the occurrence of the red tides in addition it was also found that after 2003 po4 3 transported by the changjiang had positive correlations with chl a r 0 648 n 10 p 0 05 in the estuary and adjacent sea area indicating that the enrichment of po4 3 in the changjiang may promote the increase of chl a concentrations in the estuary so did tgr s storage affect the frequency and area of red tides in the ecs to a certain extent the assessment was rather difficult at present due to the lack of long term experimental data such as time series changes of nutrients in the mid downstream of the changjiang moreover the response of shallow lakes in the mid downstream on the scheduling model of tgr impoundment was not well understood meanwhile the interception of nutrients in the reservoir should have a seasonal and interannual variations therefore scientifically and comprehensively estimating the relationship between the ecological health of the ecs and the dispatching modes of tgr needed to rely on the accumulation and analysis of longer term data 5 conclusions this study focused on nutrient dynamics in the changjiang and retention effect in the tgr the changjiang is enriched with spm din and dsi depleted with respect to don po4 3 dop pop and bsi because of the impoundment don and dop concentrations increased from the inflow to the outflow of the tgr while other nutrients were on the contrary the higher pop near the estuary may have a potential impact on receiving coastal marine ecosystems based on input output mass balance model the retention of nutrients in the tgr were different dissolved nutrient retention was in the order of po4 3 31 2 din 23 5 dsi 2 8 approximately 3 42 104 t a dsi was assimilated by diatoms whereas 6 84 104 t a din and 4 28 103 t a po4 3 were assimilated by phytoplankton the retention of don and dop were lower in the tgr even tgr also served as a source of don in the river however tgr played an important role in the trapping of the incoming tpp 0 32 104 t a tpp and bsi 1 82 104 t a bsi which accounted for 30 8 and 34 3 of the total input loads respectively impoundment of the tgd affected the ecological health of the reservoir and estuary since 2003 nutrient status in the tgr was mainly mesotrophic but slight eutrophication significantly increased during 2005 2016 which implies that there was still a risk of algal blooms in the reservoir and tributaries moreover the estuary and adjacent seas were likely to become more eutrophic because of the retention of tgr on nutrients in the river and anthropogenic disturbance in the mid downstream nevertheless the outbreak frequency and area of the red tide in the ecs significantly decreased after 2003 in order to understand the effect of the operation mode of tgr on red tide in the ecs a longer time scale

6424,one biotechnology that can reduce nitrate concentration in subsurface drainage water is called a denitrification bed bromide tracer testing has been used to determine the hydraulic properties of these systems to be used in design and modeling but efficacy of bromide tracers has not been investigated one important hydraulic property of woodchip beds is its in situ effective porosity the objectives of this study were to 1 determine if bromide is a suitable tracer for evaluating the hydraulics of woodchip beds based on laboratory sorption experiments and field tracer testing and 2 to determine the in situ effective porosity of denitrification beds to achieve this goal we conducted bromide sorption experiments in the laboratory and conducted bromide tracer testing in seven denitrification beds near willmar minnesota usa we did not find sorption neither adsorption nor absorption of bromide to woodchips in our laboratory sorption experiments in contrast bromide tracer tests showed an average bromide recovery of 82 revealing that bromide was retarded in the woodchip denitrification beds to the best of our knowledge our experiment is the first study to estimate the in situ effective porosity average of 0 61 of a typical field scale denitrification bed using a tracer test a more accurate estimate of the actual hydraulic retention time hrt can be obtained by using the in situ effective porosity rather than total porosity our laboratory experiment did not show any sorption of bromide to woodchips but in contrast and for unclear reasons our field tracer testing showed bromide retardation keywords denitrifying bioreactor effective porosity hydraulic retention time subsurface drainage tile drainage woodchip bioreactor 1 introduction when elevated concentrations of nitrate flows into surface water it can cause deleterious effects on the environment while nitrate is transported via the pathway of agricultural subsurface drainage ghane et al 2016b a denitrification bed also known as a woodchip bioreactor can reduce nitrate concentration before it enters surface water addy et al 2016 bednarek et al 2014 schipper et al 2010 in this system hereafter referred to as bed denitrification is the main mechanism for nitrate removal warneke et al 2011 and woodchips are the most common medium used as this system is relatively new there is a need to evaluate its internal hydraulics using tracer testing under field conditions if we are to successfully design and model the flow through these beds tracer testing can also be used to determine the in situ properties of woodchip beds that can be used in its design and modeling one important hydraulic property of woodchip beds is the in situ effective porosity which is determined from tracer testing effective porosity is the interconnected active pore volume that contribute to transmitting water fetter 2001 sen 2015 and it is used for estimating the actual hydraulic retention time actual hrt in design and modeling of beds kadlec and wallace 2009 however we did not find any study that had estimated the in situ effective porosity of a field scale bed with a diffuse source inflow and outflow setting using a tracer test a diffuse source inflow and outflow is the common design for beds treating drainage water in the midwest usa and it includes collector and distributor pipes that extend across the entire width of a bed therefore a need exists to determine the in situ effective porosity of typical beds using tracer tests bromide is a common chemical for tracer testing of field scale beds column bioreactors with woodchip media and other systems such as wetlands since it has long been assumed to be an inert chemical ghane et al 2015 found retardation of bromide in a tracer test of a denitrification bed but sorption of bromide to woodchips has not been shown in laboratory sorption experiments although bromide occurs at low natural concentrations it should not be sorbed i e neither adsorption nor absorption by woodchips and it should also be conserved to be a suitable tracer denbigh and turner 1984 kadlec and wallace 2009 levenspiel 2012 metcalf and eddy 2014 therefore verification of whether bromide is retained by woodchip media is needed using laboratory sorption experiments and field tracer testing a review of the literature shows that there is a need to assess the efficacy of bromide tracer in evaluating the hydraulic performance of denitrification beds in this study we compared the hydraulic performance of eight denitrification beds that will be used in an upcoming replicated experiment involving the enhancement of nitrate removal under cold temperatures the objectives of this study were to 1 determine if bromide is a suitable tracer for woodchip media based on laboratory sorption experiments 2 determine the suitability of bromide based on field tracer testing of denitrification beds i e evaluating the hydraulic performance and 3 determine the in situ effective porosity of eight denitrification beds 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description in november 2010 a plastic lined bed 106 4 m long and 1 49 to 1 86 m wide was installed on a private farm near willmar minnesota usa geospatial map in supplementary material in october 2014 we retrofitted that plastic lined bed into eight smaller beds supplementary video 1 fig 1 during the retrofitting four year old woodchips along the bed length were collected and combined to yield a composite sample i e representing the entire bed for laboratory sorption experiments section 2 2 carbon quality of these woodchips can be found in ghane et al 2018 retrofitting the original bed resulted in eight plastic lined beds with lengths ranging from 11 51 to 11 67 m widths ranging from 1 49 to 1 86 m table 1 and having a soil cover ranging from about 0 1 to 0 6 m each of the eight beds were separated from one another using a compacted soil berm with an average length of 1 83 m fig 1 plastic sheets 13 mm thick were inserted before and after the soil berms to prevent water movement between beds all the vertical pipes were pvc and were installed to the bottom of each bed except woodchip ports 3 and 4 geotextile fabric was laid on top of the woodchips at the inlet and outlet ends of each bed i e vicinity of inlet and outlet pipe to separate the woodchips from the soil and the fabric was covered with soil up to the ground surface photos of the plastic sheet and geotextile fabric as well as a plan view of a bed can be found in the companion paper of ghane et al 2019 subsurface drainage water from the adjacent cropped field flowed into a sump from which the water was pumped into an 11 355 l tank supplementary image 1 excess drainage water above the capacity of the tank was pumped into an adjacent wetland the water head in the tank forced gravity flow of water through a manifold for distributing water to each bed water from the manifold flowed through a globe valve for adjusting the flow rate of each bed and then through a paddlewheel flow sensor model fp 5300 omega stanford connecticut usa to measure the inflow rate of each bed supplementary image 2 following the paddlewheel water flowed in a pipe 38 mm diameter pvc toward the inlet pipe 100 mm diameter pvc of each bed supplementary image 3 after water entered the inlet pipe it flowed out of the distributor pipe and into the bed when water reached the end of the bed it was collected via the collector pipe 100 mm diameter perforated corrugated tubing and into the outlet pipe 350 mm diameter pvc fig 1 the collector and distributor pipes were placed at the bottom of the beds and were made of 100 mm diameter perforated corrugated tubing with extra 6 mm drilled holes while extending across the entire width of each bed water inside the outlet pipe was collected inside a bucket from which it was pumped model 2van7 dayton electronics manufacturing co niles illinois usa through a paddlewheel flow sensor to measure the outflow rate of each bed after the paddlewheel water was transported to an adjacent wetland via a pvc pipe 38 mm diameter the inlet and outlet piezometers 50 mm diameter pvc were used to measure the height of water at the inlet and outlet of each bed respectively fig 1 water height was measured manually using a meter stick and water finding paste kolor kut products houston texas we used the water height to calculate the saturated volume v s of each bed 2 2 laboratory sorption experiments to verify if bromide is a suitable tracer for woodchip media two bromide sorption processes were investigated including adsorption and absorption adsorption is by formation of a bond between bromide and carbon of the organic compounds of wood and is absorption when bromide diffuses into the interior pores of woodchips physical entrapment strawn et al 2015 to investigate these two processes we conducted three laboratory sorption experiments the first sorption experiment was conducted on four year old woodchips unwashed and ground to evaluate adsorption the second and third experiments were conducted on four year old woodchips unwashed and washed respectively to evaluate the combined effect of absorption and adsorption 2 2 1 experiment 1 ground woodchips for sorption experiment 1 we mixed the air dried composite woodchips that had fine wood and sediments in a tray and took a representative sample for grinding wiley mill standard model 3 thomas scientific swedesboro new jersey usa then the wood particles were further ground using another grinder to obtain particles with size of 1 mm we poured a known mass of the ground woodchips into seven 500 ml bottles i e six test bottles plus one control we then prepared varying initial bromide concentrations ranging from 9 4 to 76 0 mg l 1 by measuring six different quantities of potassium bromide kbr in cups and emptying the kbr granulates from the measuring cups into 1000 ml bottles the measuring cups were rinsed with deionized water into the 1000 ml bottles to capture the entire kbr then we added agricultural drainage water collected from the site described in section 2 1 to the 1000 ml bottles after shaking the 1000 ml bottles for 5 min we took water samples from them to analyze for the initial bromide concentration the sorption experiment was initiated by pouring the six bromide solutions from the 1000 ml bottles into the six 500 ml bottles containing ground woodchips as well as pouring drainage water into the seventh 500 ml bottle to create a control sample subsequently we measured the mass of water in the 500 ml bottles and then placed them on a reciprocal shaker model e6005 eberbach corp ann arbor mi usa to shake for 5 h at room temperature after the shaking process the solutions were poured into centrifuge tubes sarstedt nümbrecht germany and were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min at 15 c following centrifugation we collected the solutions by filtering through a 0 45 μm sterile syringe filter vwr radnor pennsylvania usa filtered solutions were kept in a cooler at 4 c until analysis for equilibrium bromide concentration 2 2 2 experiments 2 and 3 unwashed woodchips for the second sorption experiment we poured a known mass of the air dried composite old woodchips that had fine wood and sediments into seven 500 ml bottles i e six test bottles plus one control we then prepared six initial bromide concentrations ranging from 6 1 to 69 9 mg l 1 into 1000 ml bottles i e independent from experiment 1 using the procedure described in section 2 2 1 after shaking the 1000 ml bottles for 5 min we took water samples to analyze for the initial bromide concentration the sorption experiment was initiated by pouring the six bromide solutions from the 1000 ml bottles into the six 500 ml bottles containing woodchips as well as pouring drainage water into the seventh 500 ml bottle to create a control sample the 500 ml bottles were shaken for 1 h and the samples were centrifuged and filtered as described in section 2 2 1 to obtain the filtered solutions filtered solutions were kept in a cooler at 4 c until analysis for equilibrium bromide concentration we conducted the third experiment simultaneously with the second experiment using the same initial bromide solutions with the only difference that the old composite woodchips were washed with drainage water to remove sediments and fine wood particles the washed composite woodchips were then air dried for the third experiment photos of the ground and woodchips can be found in the companion paper of ghane et al 2019 2 2 3 sorption calculation the amount of bromide retained by woodchips x mg kg 1 is calculated as 1 x c i c e v w m wc where c i and c e is the concentration in the initial and equilibrium solutions mg l 1 respectively v w is the volume of water l and m wc is the mass of air dried ground woodchips or woodchips kg strawn et al 2015 2 2 4 water analysis for sorption experiments to determine the bromide concentrations we used a colorimetric method however we found that the colorimetric method was underestimating bromide concentration due to the yellow color of the water that was in contact with woodchip more details about this underestimation can be found in the companion paper of ghane et al 2019 consequently we used ion chromatography to determine the bromide concentrations initial bromide solutions and filtered solutions were analyzed for bromide within 44 days using ion chromatography thermo scientific dionex integrion hpic san jose ca usa at the research analytical laboratory university of minnesota the ion chromatography instrument was able to measure up to 100 mg l 1 of bromide based on standard calibration so our samples did not need dilution as they were below 100 mg l 1 finally we measured the ph of the initial bromide and equilibrium solutions for all three sorption experiments using a benchtop meter model sb90m5 vwr symphony radnor pa usa for the sorption experiments bottles without bromide addition i e control were used to determine the background concentration of bromide in the wood sampling the control bottles after shaking showed that the natural background concentrations of bromide in the wood were below our detection limit of 0 1 mg l 1 table 2 2 3 bromide tracer field test we dissolved 400 g of potassium bromide 265 9 g of br in about 10 l of water and poured the solution into the inlet pipe of each bed in less than 30 s subsequently samples were collected from the outlet pipe of each bed using two auto samplers 6700 series teledyne isco lincoln nebraska usa beginning with 15 min intervals during the rise and peak of the hydrograph and increased to 60 min during the fall of the hydrograph the last water sample was collected after 23 h from pouring the bromide solution into the inlet pipe of each bed flow rate was adjusted using a globe valve and was kept relatively constant by maintaining a constant water level in the tank a measured total porosity of 0 85 drainable porosity plus specific retention for old woodchips from ghane et al 2014 was used to calculate the theoretical nominal retention time for beds 2 to 8 ghane et al 2014 measured drainable porosity by draining woodchip columns over 24 h and specific retention was measured by oven drying the woodchip samples after 24 h bed number 1 was found to have a major leak that resulted in considerable loss of inflow so we did not conduct a tracer test for this bed water samples from the tracer tests were kept in a cooler at 4 c until analyzed for bromide within 6 weeks by colorimety lachat quikchem 8500 flow injection analysis hack co loveland co usa based on the quikchem method 10 135 21 2 b the relative standard deviation rsd of this method is 1 54 at 5 0 mg l 1 as we had clear water samples i e no yellow colored water we did not encounter interferences with the bromide measurements 2 4 hydraulic terms 2 4 1 mean tracer residence time the mean tracer residence time actual hrt in hours is the first moment of the residence time distribution rtd curve i e centroid of the area under rtd curve at steady state flow the mean tracer residence time t is estimated as 2 t t i c i δ t i c i δ t i where t i is the time h at the i th sample c i is the outlet bromide concentration mg l 1 and δ t i is the time interval h between sampling metcalf and eddy 2014 2 4 2 tracer recovery the percent bromide recovery was calculated as the ratio of the mass of bromide recovered at the outlet m out to the mass of bromide injected into the inlet of the bed m in the mass of bromide recovered in milligrams is the zeroth moment of the rtd curve and it is estimated as 3 m out 60 q i c i δ t i where q i is the outflow rate at the i th sample l min 1 c i is the outlet bromide concentration mg l 1 and δ t i is the time interval h between sampling kadlec and wallace 2009 2 4 3 theoretical hydraulic retention time for water flow through porous media e g denitrification beds the nominal theoretical retention time in hours is calculated as kadlec and wallace 2009 4 t n v s n 60 q ave where v s is the saturated volume of the bed l n is total porosity of the media and q ave is approximated as the average of the inflow and outflow rates of the bed l min 1 the approximation of q ave is good at a 4 accuracy if the water recovery fraction r outflow inflow is 0 5 r 2 0 kadlec and wallace 2009 when variation in flow rate from the inflow to outflow is negligible i e under minimal leaks the outflow rate can be used in the calculation of t n total porosity n is the ratio of void volume to total volume of woodchips that is equal to the sum of specific yield drainable porosity and specific retention internal porosity sen 2015 ward et al 2016 to compare various tracer tests from the same denitrification bed or between different beds we used the plot of temporally normalized rtd versus normalized time metcalf and eddy 2014 the normalized time θ is calculated as the ratio of t i over the theoretical hydraulic retention time t n and the normalized rtd at the i th sample and at steady state is calculated as 5 e θ 60 q ave c i m out t n where m out is the total mass of bromide recovered mg eq 3 2 4 4 volumetric efficiency thackston et al 1987 defined volumetric efficiency e v as 6 e v t t n a volumetric efficiency of 1 indicates full use of the reactor total pore volume a value less than 1 0 indicates the flow distribution is not uniform i e due to dead zones and a value greater than 1 indicates physical chemical retardation kadlec and wallace 2009 once volumetric efficiency is determined from a tracer test it can be used to correct the theoretical hydraulic retention time to yield the actual hydraulic retention time ahrt as 7 ahrt e v t n 2 4 5 in situ effective porosity after calculating the mean tracer residence time t from the tracer tests the in situ effective porosity of the beds is estimated as 8 n e 60 q ave t v s 2 4 6 actual hydraulic retention time the ahrt is appropriate for design and modeling of denitrification beds since it provides the actual time it takes for water to travel through the bed by combining eqs 4 and 7 we can calculate the actual hydraulic retention time as 9 ahrt e v v s n 60 q ave by substituting n e n e v in eq 9 the above equation shrinks to 10 ahrt v s n e q ave where n e is the in situ effective porosity of the woodchip media therefore if we have the effective porosity of a denitrification bed we can calculate its ahrt 2 4 7 morrill dispersion index the morrill dispersion index mdi is an indicator of mixing which is written as 11 mdi t 90 t 10 where t 10 and t 90 are the times at which 10 and 90 of the recovered tracer has passed through the woodchip bed metcalf and eddy 2014 an mdi of 1 0 indicates ideal plug flow reactor and when 1 0 mdi 2 0 is considered an effective plug flow reactor and mdi of 22 0 is indicative of a complete mix bioreactor 3 results and discussion 3 1 laboratory bromide sorption experiments in a typical sorption experiment the solid to solution ratio needs to fall within the range of 0 005 to 0 5 to allow for uniform mixing of the suspension strawn et al 2015 thus we conducted sorption experiment 1 such that the ground wood to water ratio was within this range i e 0 17 0 18 g ml 1 table 2 for sorption experiments 2 and 3 the wood to solution ratio i e 0 32 0 35 g ml 1 was selected to represent the wood and water matrix in a denitrification bed under field conditions as closely as possible table 2 measurements of ph for sorption experiments 1 2 and 3 ghane et al 2019 show that the ph of the equilibrium solutions i e 6 8 7 1 was close to the range of 6 7 to 7 1 reported for bed outflows treating drainage water and greenhouse effluent ghane et al 2015 warneke et al 2011 this range is within the optimum range of 6 0 to 8 0 for denitrifying organisms pierzynski et al 2005 3 1 1 bromide sorption experiment 1 ground woodchips the purpose of experiment 1 was to evaluate adsorption which is the formation of a bond between bromide and carbon of the organic compounds of wood strawn et al 2015 bromide has been reported to not adsorb i e by electrostatic attraction to clay minerals in temperate regions due to the mineral s negative surface charge gilley et al 1990 korom 2000 levy and chambers 1987 but more recently it has been shown that bromide adsorbs to temperate soils at a ph below 7 goldberg and kabengi 2010 furthermore bromide can become oxidized and form a bond with carbon during bromination i e transformation from inorganic to organic and this form has been found to be reactive with organic matter leri and ravel 2015 woodchips have lignin an aromatic compound that is a good substrate for bromination reactions leri and ravel 2015 furthermore plant materials e g woodchips are more vulnerable to bromination than decomposed organic material e g humus due to the presence of a labile or fast pool of organic compounds leri and ravel 2015 having explained the potential for bromination in experiment 1 table 2 and fig 2 show that the concentration of bromide did not reduce after being in contact with ground woodchips for 5 h based on experiment 1 we found no clear trend of adsorption of bromide to ground woodchips table 3 nonetheless we suggest investigating the presence of organobromine in woodchips following a bromide tracer test at a field scale denitrification bed 3 1 2 bromide sorption experiments 2 and 3 woodchips the purpose of experiments 2 and 3 was to evaluate the combined effect of adsorption and absorption since experiment 1 showed that adsorption was not present section 3 1 1 the primary purpose of experiments 2 and 3 was to evaluate absorption which occurs when bromide diffuses into the interior pores of woodchips physical entrapment strawn et al 2015 kahler and kabala 2016 also explained that contaminants enter dead end pores under steady state flow through molecular diffusion so bromide can get physically trapped in these dead end pores following tracer testing based on our lab procedure we did not find any clear trend of bromide sorption to woodchips table 2 which is opposite of what we expected due to the inherent porosity of woodchips nevertheless we recommend investigating the interior pores of woodchips under a microscope to gain a better understanding of the possibility of bromide entrapment in the interior pores of woodchips 3 2 bromide tracer testing of denitrification beds 3 2 1 tracer residence time distribution curve our temporally normalized rtd curves show that the peak concentrations have been included in the sampling fig 3 the plot of bromide concentration versus time can be found in the companion paper of ghane et al 2019 the temporally normalized rtd curves show that the hydraulic behavior of the bromide tracer was generally similar for beds 3 to 8 i e time delayed and skewed bell shaped fig 3 however bed 2 showed a very different pattern than all other beds the general similarity of the curves for beds 3 to 8 can be explained by their similar dimension table 1 as well as their similar d50 i e diameter at which 50 of particles are finer according to the companion study of ghane et al 2018 minor variations in the curves can be explained by minor differences in dimension table 1 bottom elevation ghane et al 2019 and woodchip packing for bed 2 the bell shaped pattern is not as skewed as the other curves more investigation is needed to determine the reason for the anomaly of the normalized rtd curve of bed 2 3 2 2 bromide recovery tracer recovery near 100 is important for validating the conservancy of the tracer used kadlec and wallace 2009 metcalf and eddy 2014 in general since denitrification beds are commonly installed with a plastic liner and they have diffuse source inflow and outflow section 3 3 we expect recovery of an inert tracer near 100 in our tracer experiments we calculated a wide range of bromide mass recovery from 76 to 96 with an average of 82 13 3 table 3 the average bromide concentration of the last water sample collected for all the tracer tests was 3 6 mg l 1 the average bromide recovery of 82 reveals that approximately 18 of the bromide was retarded in the woodchip beds in contrast we did not find sorption of bromide to woodchips in our laboratory sorption experiments section 3 1 it is important to note that the laboratory experiments did not fully represent the field condition for example in the laboratory woodchips were dry before wetting with the bromide solution while in the field the woodchips were wet before adding the bromide tracer in the laboratory bromide did not move into the woodchip interior pores by diffusion as it moved by mass flow of bromide water whereas in the field bromide would have moved into the interior pores by diffusion as woodchips were already filled with non bromide water furthermore there may have been processes under field conditions that were responsible for the retardation of bromide in the woodchip beds that we could not fully simulate in our laboratory sorption experiments one possible explanation for the bromide retardation under field conditions could be sorption to biofilm bacteria and or woodchips a more likely reason could be physical entrapment of bromide in the dead zones of the bed since our woodchip beds had non uniform bottom slope ghane et al 2019 potential dead zones near the bed bottom may have temporarily trapped the bromide section 3 3 and may have been partially responsible for the low bromide recovery furthermore the collector pipes in our woodchip beds were installed at about 10 cm away from the outlet bed wall so dead zones may have formed on the downstream side of the collector pipes another possible reason could be bromide entrapment into the interior pores of the woodchips following tracer testing we recommend excavating a woodchip bed following a bromide tracer testing and analyzing the woodchips for bromide that may have been physically trapped in the interior pores of the woodchips other studies have also reported bromide tracer recoveries as low as 40 for a pilot scale laboratory bioreactor made from silicone sealed plywood christianson et al 2011b as low as 17 for a pilot scale bed lined with polyethylene tarpaulin christianson et al 2011a as low as 60 for an unlined woodchip bed that allowed seepage christianson et al 2013 84 in a pilot scale upflow bioreactor made from a polyethylene tank jaynes et al 2016 and an average 77 for pilot scale waterproof concrete denitrification beds hoover et al 2017 one possible cause for these low bromide recoveries could be retardation due to sorption to biofilm bacteria and or woodchips which needs to be investigated for unlined beds another reason for low bromide recovery can be loss of bromide with seepage for the beds with point source outflow in hoover et al 2017 another reason could be entrapment of bromide in the dead zones that have stagnant water fig 4 b 3 2 3 bromide mean residence time for beds 2 to 8 the mean tracer residence times ranged from 8 84 to 13 61 h table 4 however the low bromide recoveries section 3 2 2 suggest retardation of bromide in the bed when retardation is present in a tracer test mean tracer residence times will be overestimated as a result we will take caution in evaluating the hydraulic performance e g dispersion short circuiting and efficiency of each bed using the hydraulic terms but we can still compare the beds to each other as the effect of bromide retardation is expected to be similar across beds some studies have used bromide as a tracer to calculate the tracer residence time in laboratory columns healy et al 2015 others have used bromide tracer to evaluate the hydraulics of woodchips in laboratory columns hoover et al 2016 in pilot scale beds christianson et al 2011a and in an unlined bed christianson et al 2013 caution is advised when interpreting hydraulic indices from bromide tracer results since we showed bromide did not meet the conservancy requirement of an inert tracer section 3 2 2 therefore this is an area that needs further investigation 3 2 4 theoretical hrt from bromide tracer for beds 2 to 8 the theoretical hrt ranged from 12 30 to 19 81 h table 4 based on a total porosity assumption of 0 85 from ghane et al 2014 it is important to note that t n and n e should be compared with that from other denitrification beds that were calculated using the same flow rate i e either average of the inflow and outflow rates or only outflow rate when bed leakage is negligible based on our calculations lower values of outflow than average flow rate i e due to possible leakage for beds 2 3 5 6 7 and 8 induced t n to be overestimated and n e to be underestimated than those based on the average flow rate ghane et al 2019 this shows that the choice of the flow rate substantially affects t n and n e when beds have considerable leakage due to being unlined or having major punctures in their plastic liner furthermore t n is dependent on the value of total porosity used in its calculation so t n calculated based on a total porosity of 0 85 should not be compared to that of an assumed 0 70 overall we advise caution when comparing these hydraulic terms to other studies in terms of the calculation of theoretical hrt some studies have reported the theoretical hrt of a denitrification bed christianson et al 2013 and laboratory bioreactors pluer et al 2016 based on the saturated woodchip volume other studies have calculated the theoretical hrt by including the unsaturated woodchip pore volume i e pore volume above the water table christianson et al 2011b porter et al 2015 and without including the total porosity of woodchips david et al 2016 per comm liang et al 2015 which results in overestimation of the theoretical hrt 3 2 5 volumetric efficiency from bromide tracer results of the bromide tracer tests indicate very similar volumetric efficiencies e v for beds 4 5 6 and 8 i e 0 68 0 013 and e v for beds 3 and 7 i e 0 77 0 051 was close to the former mentioned beds table 4 however bed 2 showed a very different e v than other beds these results are consistent with the differences in their temporally normalized rtd curves fig 3 the general similarity of the e v for beds 3 to 8 can be explained by their similar dimension table 1 as well as their similar d50 i e diameter at which 50 of particles are finer according to the companion study of ghane et al 2018 we did not find volumetric efficiencies greater than one in any of the tracer tests that would have been one indicator of physical or chemical retardation however ghane et al 2015 found volumetric efficiency greater than one indicating retardation of bromide to woodchips in a tracer test of a denitrification bed based on the bromide tracer test data published in christianson et al 2011a we were able to calculate volumetric efficiencies greater than one for all of their pilot scale beds in another study christianson et al 2011b used the unsaturated woodchip volume above the water table to calculate t n and when we used the saturated woodchip volume from their data we were able to calculate e v greater than one for all six of their pilot scale beds cameron and schipper 2012 also reported a volumetric efficiency greater than one while injecting 99 of the bromide tracer into their woodchip columns over a 4 5 h period rather than a short period of time the previously reported retardations i e volumetric efficiency greater than one are consistent with our finding of low bromide recovery from tracer testing section 3 2 2 it is important to note that interpretation of the hydraulic performance of woodchip beds based on volumetric efficiency should be done with caution in a steady state porous system without dead zones the entire porosity is involved in the active flow of water n n e and thereby the mean tracer residence time is equal to the theoretical hrt e v 1 kadlec and wallace 2009 however the theoretical hrt is calculated using total porosity that includes non active pore volumes i e dead end pore volumes internal to woodchips this causes the theoretical hrt to normally be greater than the tracer residence time e v 1 since effective porosity is smaller than total porosity of woodchips therefore volumetric efficiency lower than one may not necessarily indicate non uniform flow furthermore volumetric efficiency is dependent on the value of total porosity used in its calculation therefore various assumptions of total porosity will result in different volumetric efficiencies 3 2 6 in situ effective porosity from bromide tracer testing based on the bromide tracer tests the in situ effective porosity ranged from 0 57 to 0 80 table 4 results indicate very similar effective porosity n e for beds 4 5 6 and 8 i e 0 58 0 011 and n e for beds 3 and 7 had effective porosities 0 66 0 043 very close to other beds however bed 2 showed a very different n e i e 0 80 than the other beds these results are consistent with the differences in their temporally normalized rtd curves fig 3 the general similarity of the n e for beds 3 to 8 can be explained by their similar dimension table 1 as well as their similar d50 i e diameter at which 50 of particles are finer according to the companion study of ghane et al 2018 an in situ effective porosity is useful for estimating the actual hydraulic retention time ahrt eq 9 for design and modeling of beds kadlec and wallace 2009 even though the average in situ effective porosity was 0 61 0 045 for beds 3 to 8 it was lower than total porosity values of 0 65 to 0 84 christianson et al 2017 law et al 2018 lepine et al 2016 woli et al 2010 used to estimate the actual hrt we advise caution in using overly large porosities since it may result in overestimation of the actual hrt to the best of our knowledge our experiment is the first study to estimate the in situ effective porosity of a typical bed i e with a diffuse source inflow and outflow using a tracer test under field conditions the lower effective porosity i e 0 61 0 045 than total porosity i e assumed 0 85 of woodchip media is evidence that the entire porosity of woodchips does not contribute to the active flow of water in a bed specific retention is the water volume retained against gravity which describes the water content held inside woodchip particles since this water is held inside woodchip pores its content has been determined from drying of gravity drained woodchips using a fume hood and an oven feyereisen and christianson 2015 ghane et al 2014 robertson 2010 therefore using large effective porosity values i e 0 65 can result in overestimation of the actual hrt in situ drainable porosity values close to 0 40 to 0 45 have been reported ghane et al 2016a 2014 to yield the actual hrt for beds under field conditions when effective porosity was unavailable from tracer testing based on a literature review bromide has been used as a tracer to calculate the effective porosity of woodchips in laboratory columns healy et al 2012 some studies have provided rough estimates of in situ effective porosity based on sodium chloride nacl tracer tests for a bed with a point source inflow see section 3 4 van driel et al 2006 provided a rough estimate of 0 7 for the in situ effective porosity of a lateral flow denitrification bed which was based on an assumption of 90 of flow through the coarse woodchip layer later robertson et al 2009 conducted another tracer test on the same bed and reported a rough estimate of 0 7 for the in situ effective porosity in which they used an assumption of 100 after year 3 of their experiment however we could not find the reason for their assumptions and its variation over time the suitability of nacl tracer for woodchips is discussed in section 3 4 3 2 7 morrill dispersion index of bromide tracer the morrill dispersion index mdi for beds 2 to 8 ranged from 2 1 to 2 6 table 4 when 1 0 mdi 2 0 it is considered that we have an effective plug flow reactor our mdi values show that there is some mixing taking place in the beds with the higher value showing more mixing than the lower value our values show relatively better plug flow characteristics than other bromide tracer tests christianson et al 2013 reported an mdi of 3 2 and 4 2 for an unlined denitrification bed christianson et al 2013 hoover et al 2017 reported an average mdi of 2 8 for pilot scale waterproof concrete denitrification beds with point source outflow based on the data published in ghane et al 2015 an mdi of 2 7 can be calculated for that denitrification bed in ohio 3 3 effective porosity of diffuse source inflow and outflow it is important to note that an in situ effective porosity determined for a bed with a point source inflow and outflow does not represent a bed with a diffuse source inflow and outflow a diffuse source inflow and outflow is the common design for beds treating drainage water in the midwest usa and it includes collector and distributor pipes that extend across the entire width of a bed fig 4a in the case of a point source inflow outflow dead zones i e stagnant water pockets will develop within the bed that will not mix with the incoming water metcalf and eddy 2014 fig 4b effective porosity from tracer testing will incorporate the effect of the dead zones for a bed with point source inflow and outflow in other words for a commonly designed bed with isotropic and homogeneous woodchips that has uniform bottom slope and width along its length when there are no considerable dead zones fig 4a other than the non active pore volume internal to woodchips drainable porosity will be close to effective porosity sen 2015 therefore we advise against using the in situ effective porosity from beds with diffuse and point source designs interchangeably this concept also applies to laboratory experiments with a point source inflow and outflow in practice there may be small dead zones in the four corners of the bed due to using non perforated drain caps at both ends of the distributor and collector pipes fig 4a dead zones may also be formed due to non uniform bottom slope and width of the bed created during construction furthermore a dead zone may be created on the upstream side of the distributor pipe if there is a gap between the distributor pipe and the bed wall i e distributor pipe is not adjacent to the bed wall and similarly a dead zone may be created on the downstream side of the collector pipe consequently low recovery of bromide in woodchip beds may partially be due to the tracer getting trapped in these dead zones during a tracer test 3 4 is nacl a suitable tracer in addition to the three bromide sorption experiments we conducted a chloride sorption experiment using the same procedure as sorption experiment 2 with the only difference being that deionized water was used instead of drainage water however chloride concentrations were detected in the control test that could have come from the woodchips so results from the chloride sorption experiment were inconclusive chloride has been reported as an ineffective tracer in soil water studies due to high natural background concentration bero et al 2016 levy and chambers 1987 though its suitability as a tracer for woodchip media has not been investigated as an alternative to measuring the concentration of chloride in the outflow of a denitrification bed an electrical conductivity ec meter to measure salt has been used to conduct tracer tests in these studies nacl has been used as a tracer for bark mulch chips in laboratory columns krause camilo et al 2013 a pilot scale bed krause camilo 2016 a lateral flow denitrification bed robertson et al 2009 van driel et al 2006 and a pilot scale laboratory bioreactor christianson et al 2016 robertson 2010 also used water with high salt concentration to conduct a tracer test for woodchip media in laboratory columns although calculation of the nacl tracer recovery is possible based on converting ec units of ds m 1 to ppm the above mentioned authors did not verify its conservancy requirement due to the inherent porous property of woodchips nacl may be absorbed to woodchips due to the molecular diffusion process and thus violate the tracer non absorption requirement denbigh and turner 1984 levenspiel 2012 in this regard christianson et al 2016 found a volumetric efficiency greater than one indicating retardation of nacl therefore we recommend investigating the suitability of nacl as a tracer for woodchip media 4 conclusions bromide tracer testing of seven denitrification beds showed an average bromide recovery of 82 13 3 sd revealing that bromide was retarded in the woodchip bed in contrast we did not find sorption neither adsorption nor absorption of bromide to woodchips in our laboratory sorption experiments perhaps other processes under field conditions are responsible for the retardation of bromide in the woodchip beds that we could not fully simulate in our laboratory sorption experiments examples of these processes are physical entrapment of bromide in the dead zones of the bed bromide entrapment into the interior pores of woodchips and sorption to biofilm and bacteria we recommend ascertaining the cause of low bromide recovery in denitrification beds even though the average in situ effective porosity for beds 3 to 8 was 0 61 it was lower than those published in the literature with greater values 0 65 that were used to estimate the actual hrt therefore a more accurate estimate of the actual hrt can be obtained by using a more realistic effective porosity than those with much greater values in addition the in situ effective porosity determined from a tracer test for a bed with a point source inflow and outflow should not be used for a bed with a diffuse source inflow and outflow in conclusion there is a need to further investigate using a bromide tracer for evaluating the hydraulic performance of denitrification beds as it may provide misleading conclusions we recommend either accounting for possible retardation of bromide to woodchips or using non sorbing and conservative tracers e g isotopes to investigate the internal hydraulics conflict of interest the authors declared that there is no

6424,one biotechnology that can reduce nitrate concentration in subsurface drainage water is called a denitrification bed bromide tracer testing has been used to determine the hydraulic properties of these systems to be used in design and modeling but efficacy of bromide tracers has not been investigated one important hydraulic property of woodchip beds is its in situ effective porosity the objectives of this study were to 1 determine if bromide is a suitable tracer for evaluating the hydraulics of woodchip beds based on laboratory sorption experiments and field tracer testing and 2 to determine the in situ effective porosity of denitrification beds to achieve this goal we conducted bromide sorption experiments in the laboratory and conducted bromide tracer testing in seven denitrification beds near willmar minnesota usa we did not find sorption neither adsorption nor absorption of bromide to woodchips in our laboratory sorption experiments in contrast bromide tracer tests showed an average bromide recovery of 82 revealing that bromide was retarded in the woodchip denitrification beds to the best of our knowledge our experiment is the first study to estimate the in situ effective porosity average of 0 61 of a typical field scale denitrification bed using a tracer test a more accurate estimate of the actual hydraulic retention time hrt can be obtained by using the in situ effective porosity rather than total porosity our laboratory experiment did not show any sorption of bromide to woodchips but in contrast and for unclear reasons our field tracer testing showed bromide retardation keywords denitrifying bioreactor effective porosity hydraulic retention time subsurface drainage tile drainage woodchip bioreactor 1 introduction when elevated concentrations of nitrate flows into surface water it can cause deleterious effects on the environment while nitrate is transported via the pathway of agricultural subsurface drainage ghane et al 2016b a denitrification bed also known as a woodchip bioreactor can reduce nitrate concentration before it enters surface water addy et al 2016 bednarek et al 2014 schipper et al 2010 in this system hereafter referred to as bed denitrification is the main mechanism for nitrate removal warneke et al 2011 and woodchips are the most common medium used as this system is relatively new there is a need to evaluate its internal hydraulics using tracer testing under field conditions if we are to successfully design and model the flow through these beds tracer testing can also be used to determine the in situ properties of woodchip beds that can be used in its design and modeling one important hydraulic property of woodchip beds is the in situ effective porosity which is determined from tracer testing effective porosity is the interconnected active pore volume that contribute to transmitting water fetter 2001 sen 2015 and it is used for estimating the actual hydraulic retention time actual hrt in design and modeling of beds kadlec and wallace 2009 however we did not find any study that had estimated the in situ effective porosity of a field scale bed with a diffuse source inflow and outflow setting using a tracer test a diffuse source inflow and outflow is the common design for beds treating drainage water in the midwest usa and it includes collector and distributor pipes that extend across the entire width of a bed therefore a need exists to determine the in situ effective porosity of typical beds using tracer tests bromide is a common chemical for tracer testing of field scale beds column bioreactors with woodchip media and other systems such as wetlands since it has long been assumed to be an inert chemical ghane et al 2015 found retardation of bromide in a tracer test of a denitrification bed but sorption of bromide to woodchips has not been shown in laboratory sorption experiments although bromide occurs at low natural concentrations it should not be sorbed i e neither adsorption nor absorption by woodchips and it should also be conserved to be a suitable tracer denbigh and turner 1984 kadlec and wallace 2009 levenspiel 2012 metcalf and eddy 2014 therefore verification of whether bromide is retained by woodchip media is needed using laboratory sorption experiments and field tracer testing a review of the literature shows that there is a need to assess the efficacy of bromide tracer in evaluating the hydraulic performance of denitrification beds in this study we compared the hydraulic performance of eight denitrification beds that will be used in an upcoming replicated experiment involving the enhancement of nitrate removal under cold temperatures the objectives of this study were to 1 determine if bromide is a suitable tracer for woodchip media based on laboratory sorption experiments 2 determine the suitability of bromide based on field tracer testing of denitrification beds i e evaluating the hydraulic performance and 3 determine the in situ effective porosity of eight denitrification beds 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description in november 2010 a plastic lined bed 106 4 m long and 1 49 to 1 86 m wide was installed on a private farm near willmar minnesota usa geospatial map in supplementary material in october 2014 we retrofitted that plastic lined bed into eight smaller beds supplementary video 1 fig 1 during the retrofitting four year old woodchips along the bed length were collected and combined to yield a composite sample i e representing the entire bed for laboratory sorption experiments section 2 2 carbon quality of these woodchips can be found in ghane et al 2018 retrofitting the original bed resulted in eight plastic lined beds with lengths ranging from 11 51 to 11 67 m widths ranging from 1 49 to 1 86 m table 1 and having a soil cover ranging from about 0 1 to 0 6 m each of the eight beds were separated from one another using a compacted soil berm with an average length of 1 83 m fig 1 plastic sheets 13 mm thick were inserted before and after the soil berms to prevent water movement between beds all the vertical pipes were pvc and were installed to the bottom of each bed except woodchip ports 3 and 4 geotextile fabric was laid on top of the woodchips at the inlet and outlet ends of each bed i e vicinity of inlet and outlet pipe to separate the woodchips from the soil and the fabric was covered with soil up to the ground surface photos of the plastic sheet and geotextile fabric as well as a plan view of a bed can be found in the companion paper of ghane et al 2019 subsurface drainage water from the adjacent cropped field flowed into a sump from which the water was pumped into an 11 355 l tank supplementary image 1 excess drainage water above the capacity of the tank was pumped into an adjacent wetland the water head in the tank forced gravity flow of water through a manifold for distributing water to each bed water from the manifold flowed through a globe valve for adjusting the flow rate of each bed and then through a paddlewheel flow sensor model fp 5300 omega stanford connecticut usa to measure the inflow rate of each bed supplementary image 2 following the paddlewheel water flowed in a pipe 38 mm diameter pvc toward the inlet pipe 100 mm diameter pvc of each bed supplementary image 3 after water entered the inlet pipe it flowed out of the distributor pipe and into the bed when water reached the end of the bed it was collected via the collector pipe 100 mm diameter perforated corrugated tubing and into the outlet pipe 350 mm diameter pvc fig 1 the collector and distributor pipes were placed at the bottom of the beds and were made of 100 mm diameter perforated corrugated tubing with extra 6 mm drilled holes while extending across the entire width of each bed water inside the outlet pipe was collected inside a bucket from which it was pumped model 2van7 dayton electronics manufacturing co niles illinois usa through a paddlewheel flow sensor to measure the outflow rate of each bed after the paddlewheel water was transported to an adjacent wetland via a pvc pipe 38 mm diameter the inlet and outlet piezometers 50 mm diameter pvc were used to measure the height of water at the inlet and outlet of each bed respectively fig 1 water height was measured manually using a meter stick and water finding paste kolor kut products houston texas we used the water height to calculate the saturated volume v s of each bed 2 2 laboratory sorption experiments to verify if bromide is a suitable tracer for woodchip media two bromide sorption processes were investigated including adsorption and absorption adsorption is by formation of a bond between bromide and carbon of the organic compounds of wood and is absorption when bromide diffuses into the interior pores of woodchips physical entrapment strawn et al 2015 to investigate these two processes we conducted three laboratory sorption experiments the first sorption experiment was conducted on four year old woodchips unwashed and ground to evaluate adsorption the second and third experiments were conducted on four year old woodchips unwashed and washed respectively to evaluate the combined effect of absorption and adsorption 2 2 1 experiment 1 ground woodchips for sorption experiment 1 we mixed the air dried composite woodchips that had fine wood and sediments in a tray and took a representative sample for grinding wiley mill standard model 3 thomas scientific swedesboro new jersey usa then the wood particles were further ground using another grinder to obtain particles with size of 1 mm we poured a known mass of the ground woodchips into seven 500 ml bottles i e six test bottles plus one control we then prepared varying initial bromide concentrations ranging from 9 4 to 76 0 mg l 1 by measuring six different quantities of potassium bromide kbr in cups and emptying the kbr granulates from the measuring cups into 1000 ml bottles the measuring cups were rinsed with deionized water into the 1000 ml bottles to capture the entire kbr then we added agricultural drainage water collected from the site described in section 2 1 to the 1000 ml bottles after shaking the 1000 ml bottles for 5 min we took water samples from them to analyze for the initial bromide concentration the sorption experiment was initiated by pouring the six bromide solutions from the 1000 ml bottles into the six 500 ml bottles containing ground woodchips as well as pouring drainage water into the seventh 500 ml bottle to create a control sample subsequently we measured the mass of water in the 500 ml bottles and then placed them on a reciprocal shaker model e6005 eberbach corp ann arbor mi usa to shake for 5 h at room temperature after the shaking process the solutions were poured into centrifuge tubes sarstedt nümbrecht germany and were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min at 15 c following centrifugation we collected the solutions by filtering through a 0 45 μm sterile syringe filter vwr radnor pennsylvania usa filtered solutions were kept in a cooler at 4 c until analysis for equilibrium bromide concentration 2 2 2 experiments 2 and 3 unwashed woodchips for the second sorption experiment we poured a known mass of the air dried composite old woodchips that had fine wood and sediments into seven 500 ml bottles i e six test bottles plus one control we then prepared six initial bromide concentrations ranging from 6 1 to 69 9 mg l 1 into 1000 ml bottles i e independent from experiment 1 using the procedure described in section 2 2 1 after shaking the 1000 ml bottles for 5 min we took water samples to analyze for the initial bromide concentration the sorption experiment was initiated by pouring the six bromide solutions from the 1000 ml bottles into the six 500 ml bottles containing woodchips as well as pouring drainage water into the seventh 500 ml bottle to create a control sample the 500 ml bottles were shaken for 1 h and the samples were centrifuged and filtered as described in section 2 2 1 to obtain the filtered solutions filtered solutions were kept in a cooler at 4 c until analysis for equilibrium bromide concentration we conducted the third experiment simultaneously with the second experiment using the same initial bromide solutions with the only difference that the old composite woodchips were washed with drainage water to remove sediments and fine wood particles the washed composite woodchips were then air dried for the third experiment photos of the ground and woodchips can be found in the companion paper of ghane et al 2019 2 2 3 sorption calculation the amount of bromide retained by woodchips x mg kg 1 is calculated as 1 x c i c e v w m wc where c i and c e is the concentration in the initial and equilibrium solutions mg l 1 respectively v w is the volume of water l and m wc is the mass of air dried ground woodchips or woodchips kg strawn et al 2015 2 2 4 water analysis for sorption experiments to determine the bromide concentrations we used a colorimetric method however we found that the colorimetric method was underestimating bromide concentration due to the yellow color of the water that was in contact with woodchip more details about this underestimation can be found in the companion paper of ghane et al 2019 consequently we used ion chromatography to determine the bromide concentrations initial bromide solutions and filtered solutions were analyzed for bromide within 44 days using ion chromatography thermo scientific dionex integrion hpic san jose ca usa at the research analytical laboratory university of minnesota the ion chromatography instrument was able to measure up to 100 mg l 1 of bromide based on standard calibration so our samples did not need dilution as they were below 100 mg l 1 finally we measured the ph of the initial bromide and equilibrium solutions for all three sorption experiments using a benchtop meter model sb90m5 vwr symphony radnor pa usa for the sorption experiments bottles without bromide addition i e control were used to determine the background concentration of bromide in the wood sampling the control bottles after shaking showed that the natural background concentrations of bromide in the wood were below our detection limit of 0 1 mg l 1 table 2 2 3 bromide tracer field test we dissolved 400 g of potassium bromide 265 9 g of br in about 10 l of water and poured the solution into the inlet pipe of each bed in less than 30 s subsequently samples were collected from the outlet pipe of each bed using two auto samplers 6700 series teledyne isco lincoln nebraska usa beginning with 15 min intervals during the rise and peak of the hydrograph and increased to 60 min during the fall of the hydrograph the last water sample was collected after 23 h from pouring the bromide solution into the inlet pipe of each bed flow rate was adjusted using a globe valve and was kept relatively constant by maintaining a constant water level in the tank a measured total porosity of 0 85 drainable porosity plus specific retention for old woodchips from ghane et al 2014 was used to calculate the theoretical nominal retention time for beds 2 to 8 ghane et al 2014 measured drainable porosity by draining woodchip columns over 24 h and specific retention was measured by oven drying the woodchip samples after 24 h bed number 1 was found to have a major leak that resulted in considerable loss of inflow so we did not conduct a tracer test for this bed water samples from the tracer tests were kept in a cooler at 4 c until analyzed for bromide within 6 weeks by colorimety lachat quikchem 8500 flow injection analysis hack co loveland co usa based on the quikchem method 10 135 21 2 b the relative standard deviation rsd of this method is 1 54 at 5 0 mg l 1 as we had clear water samples i e no yellow colored water we did not encounter interferences with the bromide measurements 2 4 hydraulic terms 2 4 1 mean tracer residence time the mean tracer residence time actual hrt in hours is the first moment of the residence time distribution rtd curve i e centroid of the area under rtd curve at steady state flow the mean tracer residence time t is estimated as 2 t t i c i δ t i c i δ t i where t i is the time h at the i th sample c i is the outlet bromide concentration mg l 1 and δ t i is the time interval h between sampling metcalf and eddy 2014 2 4 2 tracer recovery the percent bromide recovery was calculated as the ratio of the mass of bromide recovered at the outlet m out to the mass of bromide injected into the inlet of the bed m in the mass of bromide recovered in milligrams is the zeroth moment of the rtd curve and it is estimated as 3 m out 60 q i c i δ t i where q i is the outflow rate at the i th sample l min 1 c i is the outlet bromide concentration mg l 1 and δ t i is the time interval h between sampling kadlec and wallace 2009 2 4 3 theoretical hydraulic retention time for water flow through porous media e g denitrification beds the nominal theoretical retention time in hours is calculated as kadlec and wallace 2009 4 t n v s n 60 q ave where v s is the saturated volume of the bed l n is total porosity of the media and q ave is approximated as the average of the inflow and outflow rates of the bed l min 1 the approximation of q ave is good at a 4 accuracy if the water recovery fraction r outflow inflow is 0 5 r 2 0 kadlec and wallace 2009 when variation in flow rate from the inflow to outflow is negligible i e under minimal leaks the outflow rate can be used in the calculation of t n total porosity n is the ratio of void volume to total volume of woodchips that is equal to the sum of specific yield drainable porosity and specific retention internal porosity sen 2015 ward et al 2016 to compare various tracer tests from the same denitrification bed or between different beds we used the plot of temporally normalized rtd versus normalized time metcalf and eddy 2014 the normalized time θ is calculated as the ratio of t i over the theoretical hydraulic retention time t n and the normalized rtd at the i th sample and at steady state is calculated as 5 e θ 60 q ave c i m out t n where m out is the total mass of bromide recovered mg eq 3 2 4 4 volumetric efficiency thackston et al 1987 defined volumetric efficiency e v as 6 e v t t n a volumetric efficiency of 1 indicates full use of the reactor total pore volume a value less than 1 0 indicates the flow distribution is not uniform i e due to dead zones and a value greater than 1 indicates physical chemical retardation kadlec and wallace 2009 once volumetric efficiency is determined from a tracer test it can be used to correct the theoretical hydraulic retention time to yield the actual hydraulic retention time ahrt as 7 ahrt e v t n 2 4 5 in situ effective porosity after calculating the mean tracer residence time t from the tracer tests the in situ effective porosity of the beds is estimated as 8 n e 60 q ave t v s 2 4 6 actual hydraulic retention time the ahrt is appropriate for design and modeling of denitrification beds since it provides the actual time it takes for water to travel through the bed by combining eqs 4 and 7 we can calculate the actual hydraulic retention time as 9 ahrt e v v s n 60 q ave by substituting n e n e v in eq 9 the above equation shrinks to 10 ahrt v s n e q ave where n e is the in situ effective porosity of the woodchip media therefore if we have the effective porosity of a denitrification bed we can calculate its ahrt 2 4 7 morrill dispersion index the morrill dispersion index mdi is an indicator of mixing which is written as 11 mdi t 90 t 10 where t 10 and t 90 are the times at which 10 and 90 of the recovered tracer has passed through the woodchip bed metcalf and eddy 2014 an mdi of 1 0 indicates ideal plug flow reactor and when 1 0 mdi 2 0 is considered an effective plug flow reactor and mdi of 22 0 is indicative of a complete mix bioreactor 3 results and discussion 3 1 laboratory bromide sorption experiments in a typical sorption experiment the solid to solution ratio needs to fall within the range of 0 005 to 0 5 to allow for uniform mixing of the suspension strawn et al 2015 thus we conducted sorption experiment 1 such that the ground wood to water ratio was within this range i e 0 17 0 18 g ml 1 table 2 for sorption experiments 2 and 3 the wood to solution ratio i e 0 32 0 35 g ml 1 was selected to represent the wood and water matrix in a denitrification bed under field conditions as closely as possible table 2 measurements of ph for sorption experiments 1 2 and 3 ghane et al 2019 show that the ph of the equilibrium solutions i e 6 8 7 1 was close to the range of 6 7 to 7 1 reported for bed outflows treating drainage water and greenhouse effluent ghane et al 2015 warneke et al 2011 this range is within the optimum range of 6 0 to 8 0 for denitrifying organisms pierzynski et al 2005 3 1 1 bromide sorption experiment 1 ground woodchips the purpose of experiment 1 was to evaluate adsorption which is the formation of a bond between bromide and carbon of the organic compounds of wood strawn et al 2015 bromide has been reported to not adsorb i e by electrostatic attraction to clay minerals in temperate regions due to the mineral s negative surface charge gilley et al 1990 korom 2000 levy and chambers 1987 but more recently it has been shown that bromide adsorbs to temperate soils at a ph below 7 goldberg and kabengi 2010 furthermore bromide can become oxidized and form a bond with carbon during bromination i e transformation from inorganic to organic and this form has been found to be reactive with organic matter leri and ravel 2015 woodchips have lignin an aromatic compound that is a good substrate for bromination reactions leri and ravel 2015 furthermore plant materials e g woodchips are more vulnerable to bromination than decomposed organic material e g humus due to the presence of a labile or fast pool of organic compounds leri and ravel 2015 having explained the potential for bromination in experiment 1 table 2 and fig 2 show that the concentration of bromide did not reduce after being in contact with ground woodchips for 5 h based on experiment 1 we found no clear trend of adsorption of bromide to ground woodchips table 3 nonetheless we suggest investigating the presence of organobromine in woodchips following a bromide tracer test at a field scale denitrification bed 3 1 2 bromide sorption experiments 2 and 3 woodchips the purpose of experiments 2 and 3 was to evaluate the combined effect of adsorption and absorption since experiment 1 showed that adsorption was not present section 3 1 1 the primary purpose of experiments 2 and 3 was to evaluate absorption which occurs when bromide diffuses into the interior pores of woodchips physical entrapment strawn et al 2015 kahler and kabala 2016 also explained that contaminants enter dead end pores under steady state flow through molecular diffusion so bromide can get physically trapped in these dead end pores following tracer testing based on our lab procedure we did not find any clear trend of bromide sorption to woodchips table 2 which is opposite of what we expected due to the inherent porosity of woodchips nevertheless we recommend investigating the interior pores of woodchips under a microscope to gain a better understanding of the possibility of bromide entrapment in the interior pores of woodchips 3 2 bromide tracer testing of denitrification beds 3 2 1 tracer residence time distribution curve our temporally normalized rtd curves show that the peak concentrations have been included in the sampling fig 3 the plot of bromide concentration versus time can be found in the companion paper of ghane et al 2019 the temporally normalized rtd curves show that the hydraulic behavior of the bromide tracer was generally similar for beds 3 to 8 i e time delayed and skewed bell shaped fig 3 however bed 2 showed a very different pattern than all other beds the general similarity of the curves for beds 3 to 8 can be explained by their similar dimension table 1 as well as their similar d50 i e diameter at which 50 of particles are finer according to the companion study of ghane et al 2018 minor variations in the curves can be explained by minor differences in dimension table 1 bottom elevation ghane et al 2019 and woodchip packing for bed 2 the bell shaped pattern is not as skewed as the other curves more investigation is needed to determine the reason for the anomaly of the normalized rtd curve of bed 2 3 2 2 bromide recovery tracer recovery near 100 is important for validating the conservancy of the tracer used kadlec and wallace 2009 metcalf and eddy 2014 in general since denitrification beds are commonly installed with a plastic liner and they have diffuse source inflow and outflow section 3 3 we expect recovery of an inert tracer near 100 in our tracer experiments we calculated a wide range of bromide mass recovery from 76 to 96 with an average of 82 13 3 table 3 the average bromide concentration of the last water sample collected for all the tracer tests was 3 6 mg l 1 the average bromide recovery of 82 reveals that approximately 18 of the bromide was retarded in the woodchip beds in contrast we did not find sorption of bromide to woodchips in our laboratory sorption experiments section 3 1 it is important to note that the laboratory experiments did not fully represent the field condition for example in the laboratory woodchips were dry before wetting with the bromide solution while in the field the woodchips were wet before adding the bromide tracer in the laboratory bromide did not move into the woodchip interior pores by diffusion as it moved by mass flow of bromide water whereas in the field bromide would have moved into the interior pores by diffusion as woodchips were already filled with non bromide water furthermore there may have been processes under field conditions that were responsible for the retardation of bromide in the woodchip beds that we could not fully simulate in our laboratory sorption experiments one possible explanation for the bromide retardation under field conditions could be sorption to biofilm bacteria and or woodchips a more likely reason could be physical entrapment of bromide in the dead zones of the bed since our woodchip beds had non uniform bottom slope ghane et al 2019 potential dead zones near the bed bottom may have temporarily trapped the bromide section 3 3 and may have been partially responsible for the low bromide recovery furthermore the collector pipes in our woodchip beds were installed at about 10 cm away from the outlet bed wall so dead zones may have formed on the downstream side of the collector pipes another possible reason could be bromide entrapment into the interior pores of the woodchips following tracer testing we recommend excavating a woodchip bed following a bromide tracer testing and analyzing the woodchips for bromide that may have been physically trapped in the interior pores of the woodchips other studies have also reported bromide tracer recoveries as low as 40 for a pilot scale laboratory bioreactor made from silicone sealed plywood christianson et al 2011b as low as 17 for a pilot scale bed lined with polyethylene tarpaulin christianson et al 2011a as low as 60 for an unlined woodchip bed that allowed seepage christianson et al 2013 84 in a pilot scale upflow bioreactor made from a polyethylene tank jaynes et al 2016 and an average 77 for pilot scale waterproof concrete denitrification beds hoover et al 2017 one possible cause for these low bromide recoveries could be retardation due to sorption to biofilm bacteria and or woodchips which needs to be investigated for unlined beds another reason for low bromide recovery can be loss of bromide with seepage for the beds with point source outflow in hoover et al 2017 another reason could be entrapment of bromide in the dead zones that have stagnant water fig 4 b 3 2 3 bromide mean residence time for beds 2 to 8 the mean tracer residence times ranged from 8 84 to 13 61 h table 4 however the low bromide recoveries section 3 2 2 suggest retardation of bromide in the bed when retardation is present in a tracer test mean tracer residence times will be overestimated as a result we will take caution in evaluating the hydraulic performance e g dispersion short circuiting and efficiency of each bed using the hydraulic terms but we can still compare the beds to each other as the effect of bromide retardation is expected to be similar across beds some studies have used bromide as a tracer to calculate the tracer residence time in laboratory columns healy et al 2015 others have used bromide tracer to evaluate the hydraulics of woodchips in laboratory columns hoover et al 2016 in pilot scale beds christianson et al 2011a and in an unlined bed christianson et al 2013 caution is advised when interpreting hydraulic indices from bromide tracer results since we showed bromide did not meet the conservancy requirement of an inert tracer section 3 2 2 therefore this is an area that needs further investigation 3 2 4 theoretical hrt from bromide tracer for beds 2 to 8 the theoretical hrt ranged from 12 30 to 19 81 h table 4 based on a total porosity assumption of 0 85 from ghane et al 2014 it is important to note that t n and n e should be compared with that from other denitrification beds that were calculated using the same flow rate i e either average of the inflow and outflow rates or only outflow rate when bed leakage is negligible based on our calculations lower values of outflow than average flow rate i e due to possible leakage for beds 2 3 5 6 7 and 8 induced t n to be overestimated and n e to be underestimated than those based on the average flow rate ghane et al 2019 this shows that the choice of the flow rate substantially affects t n and n e when beds have considerable leakage due to being unlined or having major punctures in their plastic liner furthermore t n is dependent on the value of total porosity used in its calculation so t n calculated based on a total porosity of 0 85 should not be compared to that of an assumed 0 70 overall we advise caution when comparing these hydraulic terms to other studies in terms of the calculation of theoretical hrt some studies have reported the theoretical hrt of a denitrification bed christianson et al 2013 and laboratory bioreactors pluer et al 2016 based on the saturated woodchip volume other studies have calculated the theoretical hrt by including the unsaturated woodchip pore volume i e pore volume above the water table christianson et al 2011b porter et al 2015 and without including the total porosity of woodchips david et al 2016 per comm liang et al 2015 which results in overestimation of the theoretical hrt 3 2 5 volumetric efficiency from bromide tracer results of the bromide tracer tests indicate very similar volumetric efficiencies e v for beds 4 5 6 and 8 i e 0 68 0 013 and e v for beds 3 and 7 i e 0 77 0 051 was close to the former mentioned beds table 4 however bed 2 showed a very different e v than other beds these results are consistent with the differences in their temporally normalized rtd curves fig 3 the general similarity of the e v for beds 3 to 8 can be explained by their similar dimension table 1 as well as their similar d50 i e diameter at which 50 of particles are finer according to the companion study of ghane et al 2018 we did not find volumetric efficiencies greater than one in any of the tracer tests that would have been one indicator of physical or chemical retardation however ghane et al 2015 found volumetric efficiency greater than one indicating retardation of bromide to woodchips in a tracer test of a denitrification bed based on the bromide tracer test data published in christianson et al 2011a we were able to calculate volumetric efficiencies greater than one for all of their pilot scale beds in another study christianson et al 2011b used the unsaturated woodchip volume above the water table to calculate t n and when we used the saturated woodchip volume from their data we were able to calculate e v greater than one for all six of their pilot scale beds cameron and schipper 2012 also reported a volumetric efficiency greater than one while injecting 99 of the bromide tracer into their woodchip columns over a 4 5 h period rather than a short period of time the previously reported retardations i e volumetric efficiency greater than one are consistent with our finding of low bromide recovery from tracer testing section 3 2 2 it is important to note that interpretation of the hydraulic performance of woodchip beds based on volumetric efficiency should be done with caution in a steady state porous system without dead zones the entire porosity is involved in the active flow of water n n e and thereby the mean tracer residence time is equal to the theoretical hrt e v 1 kadlec and wallace 2009 however the theoretical hrt is calculated using total porosity that includes non active pore volumes i e dead end pore volumes internal to woodchips this causes the theoretical hrt to normally be greater than the tracer residence time e v 1 since effective porosity is smaller than total porosity of woodchips therefore volumetric efficiency lower than one may not necessarily indicate non uniform flow furthermore volumetric efficiency is dependent on the value of total porosity used in its calculation therefore various assumptions of total porosity will result in different volumetric efficiencies 3 2 6 in situ effective porosity from bromide tracer testing based on the bromide tracer tests the in situ effective porosity ranged from 0 57 to 0 80 table 4 results indicate very similar effective porosity n e for beds 4 5 6 and 8 i e 0 58 0 011 and n e for beds 3 and 7 had effective porosities 0 66 0 043 very close to other beds however bed 2 showed a very different n e i e 0 80 than the other beds these results are consistent with the differences in their temporally normalized rtd curves fig 3 the general similarity of the n e for beds 3 to 8 can be explained by their similar dimension table 1 as well as their similar d50 i e diameter at which 50 of particles are finer according to the companion study of ghane et al 2018 an in situ effective porosity is useful for estimating the actual hydraulic retention time ahrt eq 9 for design and modeling of beds kadlec and wallace 2009 even though the average in situ effective porosity was 0 61 0 045 for beds 3 to 8 it was lower than total porosity values of 0 65 to 0 84 christianson et al 2017 law et al 2018 lepine et al 2016 woli et al 2010 used to estimate the actual hrt we advise caution in using overly large porosities since it may result in overestimation of the actual hrt to the best of our knowledge our experiment is the first study to estimate the in situ effective porosity of a typical bed i e with a diffuse source inflow and outflow using a tracer test under field conditions the lower effective porosity i e 0 61 0 045 than total porosity i e assumed 0 85 of woodchip media is evidence that the entire porosity of woodchips does not contribute to the active flow of water in a bed specific retention is the water volume retained against gravity which describes the water content held inside woodchip particles since this water is held inside woodchip pores its content has been determined from drying of gravity drained woodchips using a fume hood and an oven feyereisen and christianson 2015 ghane et al 2014 robertson 2010 therefore using large effective porosity values i e 0 65 can result in overestimation of the actual hrt in situ drainable porosity values close to 0 40 to 0 45 have been reported ghane et al 2016a 2014 to yield the actual hrt for beds under field conditions when effective porosity was unavailable from tracer testing based on a literature review bromide has been used as a tracer to calculate the effective porosity of woodchips in laboratory columns healy et al 2012 some studies have provided rough estimates of in situ effective porosity based on sodium chloride nacl tracer tests for a bed with a point source inflow see section 3 4 van driel et al 2006 provided a rough estimate of 0 7 for the in situ effective porosity of a lateral flow denitrification bed which was based on an assumption of 90 of flow through the coarse woodchip layer later robertson et al 2009 conducted another tracer test on the same bed and reported a rough estimate of 0 7 for the in situ effective porosity in which they used an assumption of 100 after year 3 of their experiment however we could not find the reason for their assumptions and its variation over time the suitability of nacl tracer for woodchips is discussed in section 3 4 3 2 7 morrill dispersion index of bromide tracer the morrill dispersion index mdi for beds 2 to 8 ranged from 2 1 to 2 6 table 4 when 1 0 mdi 2 0 it is considered that we have an effective plug flow reactor our mdi values show that there is some mixing taking place in the beds with the higher value showing more mixing than the lower value our values show relatively better plug flow characteristics than other bromide tracer tests christianson et al 2013 reported an mdi of 3 2 and 4 2 for an unlined denitrification bed christianson et al 2013 hoover et al 2017 reported an average mdi of 2 8 for pilot scale waterproof concrete denitrification beds with point source outflow based on the data published in ghane et al 2015 an mdi of 2 7 can be calculated for that denitrification bed in ohio 3 3 effective porosity of diffuse source inflow and outflow it is important to note that an in situ effective porosity determined for a bed with a point source inflow and outflow does not represent a bed with a diffuse source inflow and outflow a diffuse source inflow and outflow is the common design for beds treating drainage water in the midwest usa and it includes collector and distributor pipes that extend across the entire width of a bed fig 4a in the case of a point source inflow outflow dead zones i e stagnant water pockets will develop within the bed that will not mix with the incoming water metcalf and eddy 2014 fig 4b effective porosity from tracer testing will incorporate the effect of the dead zones for a bed with point source inflow and outflow in other words for a commonly designed bed with isotropic and homogeneous woodchips that has uniform bottom slope and width along its length when there are no considerable dead zones fig 4a other than the non active pore volume internal to woodchips drainable porosity will be close to effective porosity sen 2015 therefore we advise against using the in situ effective porosity from beds with diffuse and point source designs interchangeably this concept also applies to laboratory experiments with a point source inflow and outflow in practice there may be small dead zones in the four corners of the bed due to using non perforated drain caps at both ends of the distributor and collector pipes fig 4a dead zones may also be formed due to non uniform bottom slope and width of the bed created during construction furthermore a dead zone may be created on the upstream side of the distributor pipe if there is a gap between the distributor pipe and the bed wall i e distributor pipe is not adjacent to the bed wall and similarly a dead zone may be created on the downstream side of the collector pipe consequently low recovery of bromide in woodchip beds may partially be due to the tracer getting trapped in these dead zones during a tracer test 3 4 is nacl a suitable tracer in addition to the three bromide sorption experiments we conducted a chloride sorption experiment using the same procedure as sorption experiment 2 with the only difference being that deionized water was used instead of drainage water however chloride concentrations were detected in the control test that could have come from the woodchips so results from the chloride sorption experiment were inconclusive chloride has been reported as an ineffective tracer in soil water studies due to high natural background concentration bero et al 2016 levy and chambers 1987 though its suitability as a tracer for woodchip media has not been investigated as an alternative to measuring the concentration of chloride in the outflow of a denitrification bed an electrical conductivity ec meter to measure salt has been used to conduct tracer tests in these studies nacl has been used as a tracer for bark mulch chips in laboratory columns krause camilo et al 2013 a pilot scale bed krause camilo 2016 a lateral flow denitrification bed robertson et al 2009 van driel et al 2006 and a pilot scale laboratory bioreactor christianson et al 2016 robertson 2010 also used water with high salt concentration to conduct a tracer test for woodchip media in laboratory columns although calculation of the nacl tracer recovery is possible based on converting ec units of ds m 1 to ppm the above mentioned authors did not verify its conservancy requirement due to the inherent porous property of woodchips nacl may be absorbed to woodchips due to the molecular diffusion process and thus violate the tracer non absorption requirement denbigh and turner 1984 levenspiel 2012 in this regard christianson et al 2016 found a volumetric efficiency greater than one indicating retardation of nacl therefore we recommend investigating the suitability of nacl as a tracer for woodchip media 4 conclusions bromide tracer testing of seven denitrification beds showed an average bromide recovery of 82 13 3 sd revealing that bromide was retarded in the woodchip bed in contrast we did not find sorption neither adsorption nor absorption of bromide to woodchips in our laboratory sorption experiments perhaps other processes under field conditions are responsible for the retardation of bromide in the woodchip beds that we could not fully simulate in our laboratory sorption experiments examples of these processes are physical entrapment of bromide in the dead zones of the bed bromide entrapment into the interior pores of woodchips and sorption to biofilm and bacteria we recommend ascertaining the cause of low bromide recovery in denitrification beds even though the average in situ effective porosity for beds 3 to 8 was 0 61 it was lower than those published in the literature with greater values 0 65 that were used to estimate the actual hrt therefore a more accurate estimate of the actual hrt can be obtained by using a more realistic effective porosity than those with much greater values in addition the in situ effective porosity determined from a tracer test for a bed with a point source inflow and outflow should not be used for a bed with a diffuse source inflow and outflow in conclusion there is a need to further investigate using a bromide tracer for evaluating the hydraulic performance of denitrification beds as it may provide misleading conclusions we recommend either accounting for possible retardation of bromide to woodchips or using non sorbing and conservative tracers e g isotopes to investigate the internal hydraulics conflict of interest the authors declared that there is no
