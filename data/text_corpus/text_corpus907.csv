4535,groundwater artificial recharge has been widely utilised throughout the world as an effective measure for solving groundwater overdraft many microorganisms are present in both recharging water and porous media and their metabolic activities inevitably have complicated effects on the recharge process bioclogging is attributable to the growing population of bacteria and their extracellular polymer substances secreted on the medium the formation mechanism of microbial clogging and the impact of microbial organisms on seepage were further reviewed the major factors that influence microbial clogging in the process of recharge are also discussed based on a literature review considering these problems the activities of microorganisms in different seepage conditions and the role of microbial extracellular polymeric substances epss in the recharging process are particularly addressed keywords groundwater artificial recharge microorganism extracellular polymeric substances clogging seepage characteristics 1 introduction driven by economic development groundwater overexploitation has caused increasingly serious and widespread environmental and geological problems such as land subsidence surface collapse ground fractures and seawater intrusion cui et al 2018 page et al 2014a in groundwater artificial recharge systems gars precipitation or surface water sources can be artificially infiltrated into a subsurface aquifer to supplement groundwater resources to effectively mitigate the geo environmental problems caused by groundwater overexploitation oaksford 1985 institute and unep 1998 lin et al 2020 gars have been widely employed throughout the world for decades pyne 1995 samadder et al 2011 bouwer 2002 however the recharge efficiency of the operating processes in recharge facilities has been greatly reduced or even scrapped in many cases due to clogging lindsey et al 1992 sun and miao 2001 among the 207 rainwater infiltration systems built in maryland in 1986 33 of them were scrapped due to clogging within two years operation and the number of infiltration systems out of service due to clogging increased to 50 in 1990 lindsey et al 1992 from 1981 to 2001 64 recharge systems have been built in beijing china and only 13 of these systems remained normal operation in the later stage but the remaining systems were also finally scrapped due to clogging sun and miao 2001 bloetscher et al 2014 analysed available data from 204 aquifer storage and recovery asr sites in the united states among them 11 stations were abandoned due to clogging and 18 stations were operational but encountered clogging problems clogging problems in gars can be divided into three categories according to their causes physical clogging chemical clogging and bioclogging olsthoorn 1982 physical clogging is caused mainly by the suspended solids in recharging water fetzer et al 2017 chemical clogging is caused mainly by chemical precipitation cui et al 2018 bioclogging is due mainly to clogging problems caused by microorganism growth production of extracellular polymeric substances epss and microbial activities baveye et al 1998 microorganisms are widespread in natural environments many microorganisms are present in recharging water and subsurface aquifers these microorganisms and their metabolic activities can significantly affect the hydraulic conductivity of porous media which can lead to bioclogging microbial activities can significantly reduce the permeability of the aquifer medium when the particle concentration in the recharging water is reduced by pre treatment the clogging caused by microbial activity will become more significant pavelic et al 2011 the decrease in the medium permeability caused by microorganisms is difficult to control and recover kim 2004 thullner 2010 in addition to the accumulation of microbial cells epss as viscous macromolecule polymers secreted by microbes play an important role in biological clogging arnon et al 2005 xia et al 2014a however under the influence of the recharging water quality and specific recharge conditions there are significant differences in the clogging bacteria and eps composition xia et al 2014b the specific clogging substances in the vertical infiltration profile vary with depth studies suggested that deep microbial clogging may be caused by surface biofilm shedding and migration metcalf 2002 deep biological clogging in a single medium system is considered closely related to the eps concentration perujo et al 2019 microbial activity will change the effective porosity reduce the internal permeability and affect the seepage characteristics of a medium morales et al 2010 microbial clogging can change the seepage state in the medium from saturated to unsaturated and preferential flow can be formed in the medium seifert and engesgaard 2012 seki et al 2006 the percolation hydraulic conditions can also influence the growth and settlement of microorganisms and the morphology and distribution of biofilm davey and o toole 2000 roberson and firestone 1992 microorganisms affect not only the seepage characteristics but also the occurrence and development of physiochemical clogging in porous media biofilms or epss have strong adsorption capacity their settling via adsorption on the surface of the medium can change the surface properties of the medium which will promote the settlement or migration of suspended particles from the recharging water demonstrating different properties on the medium surface he et al 2020 wang et al 2019 otherwise epss can directly combine with the suspended particles in the recharging water to increase the settlement of suspended solids and further aggravate physical clogging he et al 2015 roche et al 2017 in the process of microbial clogging the change in the microbial community can intensify chemical precipitation mauclaire et al 2006 a series of reactions such as mineral dissolution will also be triggered by the transition process from a saturated condition to an unsaturated condition greskowiak et al 2005 microorganisms and their metabolic activity can influence the characteristics of gars a series of factors such as porous media characteristics site environmental parameters recharge hydraulic conditions and hydrochemistry of recharging water will affect microbial growth and eps secretion therefore microorganisms and their metabolic activities are significant to the occurrence development and seepage process of clogging in gars based on research and analysis of growth and metabolic characteristics of common microorganisms in gars the factors that govern the growth and metabolic activities of microorganisms in artificial recharge conditions were undertaken the role and impact of microbial activity on seepage through porous media of gars and the relevant mathematical characterisation of bioclogging were discussed potential problems were identified and prospects for addressing the research gaps in this field were proposed for further in depth study 2 microbial growth and metabolism in gars 2 1 particularity of microbial growth and metabolism in gars there is some variety in terms for groundwater artificial recharge such as aquifer storage and recovery asr managed aquifer recovery mar and so on it is essentially the inclusion of more constituent elements with the development of artificial recharge for example asr addresses the process of water collection treatment and reuse dillon 2005 ringleb et al 2016 mar refers to groundwater recharge and storage in a broader sense including the indirect way of riverside exploitation to stimulate river channel to recharge groundwater dillon 2005 dillon et al 2010 ringleb et al 2016 however the effect of clogging on recharge mainly occurs in the part of groundwater infiltration regardless whatever terms in this paper gars specifically refers to this infiltration part of the gars operation after the recharging water is treated according to the manners of recharge it can be divided into surface infiltration and well injection as an active aquifer and storage management technology the main purpose of gars is to increase the reserves of groundwater therefore unlike farmland and sewage treatment gars have more stringent specifications on the quality of the recharging water and amount of water that enters groundwater bouwer 2002 dillon 2005 gale et al 2002 nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009 thus the growth and metabolism of microorganisms in gars has certain particularity which is embodied in the following aspects compared with other recharging water quality recharging water quality for gars is subject to strict standard requirements and the nutrient contents for gars is lower than that for other recharging water bouwer 2002 gale et al 2002 therefore the growth environment of microorganisms in gars is oligotrophic there are also strict requirements for the recharge site selection of gars the aquifer used for recharge generally possesses excellent permeability bouwer 2002 which intends to create an aerobic subsurface environment thus it is mainly the aerobic microorganisms that cause clogging problem this article tries to address the bioclogging caused by aerobic bacteria in addition the site selection of gars requires proper space for water storage sometimes referred as groundwater reservoirs the depth below surface of a recharge site is generally deep enough top space in the vadose zone which facilitates the unsaturated infiltration process in bioclogging the interactions between microorganisms and the seepage state in a recharge system and the influence of microorganisms on the formation of the preferential flows are discussed in the following sections 2 2 types of clogging microorganisms in gars bacteria are generally considered the main cause of medium bioclogging chapelle 1993 these bacteria may be derived from the microorganisms carried by recharging water zhang et al 2014a 2014b bai et al 2003 and are more likely to be the bacteria that are growing inside the infiltration medium the underground environment is considered to be the largest habitat of prokaryotes on earth whitman et al 1998 recharging water will be pretreated before recharge while the total number of bacteria in the groundwater extracted is generally greater than the total number of bacteria in the chemically treated water kolehmainen et al 2007 therefore the microbial content in the infiltration medium is much higher than the microbial content in the recharging water source microbial activity can significantly reduce the permeability of porous media the strict aerobic bacterium ak19 can reduce the hydraulic conductivity of a sand column by 3 to 4 orders of magnitude within 1 week vandevivere and baveye 1992b in some studies when the bacterial content exceeds 1 3 106 cfu g the hydraulic conductivity will be decreased by two orders of magnitude suleiman and swartzendruber 2003 arthrobacter methylobacterium purple bacillus and yersinia are involved in biological clogging vandevivere and baveye 1992a the characteristics of bioclogging are generally investigated via lab based simulation or field tests field tests can truly reflect actual environmental and hydrogeological conditions which is conducive to more accurate prediction and evaluation of the occurrence and development of bioclogging however due to the complexity of field conditions and the uncertainty of test conditions it is indeed difficult to obtain concise characterisation of bioclogging therefore current research on bioclogging is performed mainly in the laboratory column and sand tank experiments are the simplest most commonly used and most effective methods for investigating the clogging phenomenon according to previous studies the bacteria that can cause biological clogging including the main bacteria species that can cause bioclogging determined by a laboratory simulation experiment of artificial recharging biological clogging and the specific bacteria species selected to study the clogging mechanism in the experiment are listed in table 1 microbial activity can cause clogging in porous media which can lead to a reduction in the richness and diversity of a bacterial community hua et al 2018 2 3 growth process of microorganisms in porous media the decrease of medium permeability is closely related to the development degree of biofilm for example the development of biofilm in the surface layer of the basin will cause the surface conductivity of the basin to drop rapidly by more than three orders of magnitude masetti et al 2018 in the underground environment most bacteria attach to medium particles in the form of biofilms hazen et al 1991 the growth of biofilm on a solid surface can be divided into five stages stoodley et al 2002 otoole et al 2000 donlan 2001 fig 1 1 initial attachment of cells to the surface bacteria in a free state move near a solid wall surface and make contact with the wall surface after the bacteria are adsorbed on the solid wall surface they will fall off the solid wall surface due to the low adsorption strength 2 irreversible adhesion stage by secreting epss bacteria can firmly adsorb to the solid wall surface and attach more firmly to it bacteria begin to divide and form colonies 3 early development of biofilm architecture many bacteria divide and grow forming the early biofilm structure the biofilm community can develop considerable thickness and complexity via the nutrient exchange promoted by the biofilm structure and simultaneously keep a single cell in the optimal nutritional state in many locations of the biofilm 4 maturation of biofilm architecture with further development of the biofilm structure complex structures channels and pores are produced and bacteria are redistributed in the matrix which generally persists for a longer period 5 dispersion of single cells from the biofilm some bacteria detach from the mature biofilm and transform into free bacteria in gars the recharge rate and nutrient concentration can affect the growth of biofilms as they can be easily eliminated by high shear force at high recharge rate bioclogging at a low flow rate can be delayed for the time of local biofilm growths in narrow pore necks but the biofilm is rigid enough not to be sloughed kim et al 2010 dense biofilm will grow in high concentration solution kim et al 2010 2 4 characteristics of epss previous studies have shown that eps secretion is a general feature of microorganisms in the natural environment most microorganisms can secrete epss during the growth process flemming and wingender 2001 wingender et al 1999 some strains will lose the ability to secrete epss under laboratory conditions wingender et al 1999 thereby forming the aggregation of microorganisms and epss which is commonly known as biofilm more et al 2014 kokare et al 2009 bacterial biofilm is the main factor that causes bioclogging ragusa et al 1994 rinck pfeiffer et al 2000 in biofilm clogging research epss serve as an important adhesive for bacteria and can also protect microorganisms and provide them with a carbon source and energy in an oligotrophic environment comte et al 2006a frølund et al 1996 therefore the effect of epss on clogging is particularly prominent especially when microbial biomass is insufficient for causing bioclogging a large amount of epss secreted by microorganisms may cause clogging vandevivere and baveye 1992a 1992b 2002b thullner et al 2002a the chemical composition and structure of microbial epss are complex and related to the growth environment on the other hand the chemical composition and structure of microbial epss relates directly to extraction methods and conditions in general proteins and polysaccharides are the main eps components the proportions of proteins and polysaccharides in epss obtained from different studies slightly differ in early studies polysaccharides were regarded as the most important component of epss costerton et al 1981 however some studies have shown that extracellular polysaccharide is usually a trace component in environmental biofilm frølund et al 1996 protein is the main component of epss extracted from activated sludge zhang et al 2014a 2014b lin et al 2009 adav and lee 2008 wu et al 2009 in addition to proteins and polysaccharides epss also contain organic substances such as nucleic acids lipids humus and uronic acid among these organic substances the nucleic acid content is very small due mainly to cell lysis and release after microbial death liu and fang 2002 epss contain various groups including carboxyl amino and phosphate groups rijnaarts et al 1993 which are negatively charged in solution more et al 2014 prepared a detailed description of the role of each component in epss and its influence on the nature of epss in terms of eps structure classification researchers classified them into tight bound epss tb epss and loosely bound epss lb epss according to whether the structure is tightly wrapped outside of the cell a tb eps is situated in the inner layer closely bound to the cell surface and stably attached to the cell wall with a certain shape relatively speaking an lb eps is situated in the outer layer of a tb eps and has a relatively loose structure lb epss comprise a mucous layer that can expand to the surrounding environment without obvious edges and has a certain fluidity liu et al 2010 when bacteria are in the semi starvation or endogenous respiration phase they are generally believed to secrete high molecular weight polymers which belong to tb epss however when bacteria are in the logarithmic phase they will secrete low molecular weight polymers which are lb epss in adverse environments bacteria tend to produce more lb epss ye et al 2011 the contribution of these two eps layers with different structures in the formation of microbial clogging also differs xia et al 2016 epss have excellent adsorption capacity for metal ions and organic matter and a strong flocculation capacity as a very strong adsorbent the advantages of epss are mainly derived from two aspects epss have long chain linear structure as an adsorbent the linear structure can ensure that the adsorbent contains more binding sites jang et al 2001 zhang et al 2006 on the other hand numerous small functional groups such as amino carboxyl and hydroxyl groups are situated on the straight chain of epss hallstoodley et al 2004 these functional groups are the most preferential structures in most adsorption processes comte et al 2006b guibaud et al 2005 even when the microorganisms die functional groups such as carboxyl and hydroxyl groups may continue to function more et al 2014 yang and volesky 1999 in the artificial recharge process the functional groups on epss may adsorb suspended particles in the water source further aggravating the clogging in addition epss will adsorb components such as metal ions and organic matter and change the water quality of recharging water the existence of epss is significant for biofilms in artificial recharge conditions biofilms can obtain nutrients from flowing water der kooij et al 1995 and create potential adsorption sites for dissolved substances by producing hydrophilic epss flemming 1995 the production of the eps mucus matrix can provide support for the structure of the biofilm which largely determines the structure of the biofilm allison et al 2000 moreover the presence of epss can enhance cell deposition in porous media tong et al 2010 2 5 formation mechanism of bioclogging generally bioclogging occurs at the surface layer however in some cases such as when nutrient concentration is high and initial microbial distribution is low bioclogging may start from the middle or bottom layer seki 2013 baveye et al 1998 systematically concluded that the substances that clog pores with microbial action include four main categories accumulation of bacteria in porous media epss secreted by bacteria mainly due to the role of polysaccharides gases produced by microorganisms in life activities mainly ch4 and n2 and the accumulation of some sediments such as sulphides using microorganisms as a medium the latter two categories are caused mostly by the action of anaerobic bacteria ye et al 2009 xia 2015 it is commonly believed that the decrease in hydraulic conductivity in the initial stage of porous media during the formation of microbial clogging is caused mainly by the rapid growth and accumulation of microbial bacteria vandevivere and baveye 1992b wang et al 2020 the decrease in hydraulic conductivity in the later stage is closely related to the action of epss in the later stage numerous biofilms cover the cell surface in this stage the cells are strong enough to withstand convective transmission and form large aggregations via the eps link these cellular aggregates may clog pores or adhere to pore walls which causes reduced permeability of porous media vandevivere and baveye 1992a 1992b during this process the proportion of microorganisms such as sphingobacterium that secrete more polysaccharides in epss will increase wang et al 2020 significantly increasing the polysaccharide content in epss polysaccharides are the major substances that cause a decrease in the hydraulic conductivity in the later period therefore the same system will have completely different clogging behaviours due to different developmental rates of epss mauclaire et al 2004 in terms of eps structure the tb eps is considered to provide a carbon source and energy for bacterial cell survival with no significant effect on the reduction in medium hydraulic conductivity therefore in this process the lb eps contributes more than the tb eps vandevivere and baveye 1992a 1992b xia et al 2016 the content of different components and structures of epss comprise a key factor and important index for controlling the pore size of porous media allison 1947 the process of bioclogging is shown in fig 2 different indicators show many different divisions of the clogging stage according to the state of epss stewart and fogler 2001 divided clogging into three stages exopolymer induction phase plugging phase and plug propagation phase during the exopolymer induction phase the permeability of porous media decreased continuously but the range of the decrease was small in this stage the microbial colonies increase but are discontinuous and do not fill the pores of the medium with development of the colony the main characteristic of the plugging phase is that the hydraulic conductivity in the porous media decreases as the porosity is gradually filled during the plug propagation phase continuous clogging will occur in the direction of the water flow and biological colonies will further develop in the sand column according to the changes in the biochemical and hydraulic parameters during the clogging process zhong and wu 2013 divided the biological clogging process into four stages 1 aerobic microorganisms multiply rapidly at the entrance causing serious clogging 2 clogging develops within the whole sand column and hydrodynamic dispersion increases rapidly due to the propagation of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms 3 anaerobic microorganisms multiply rapidly produce more gas and rapidly reduce the hydrodynamic dispersion 4 both aerobic microorganisms and anaerobic microorganisms continue to multiply and the hydrodynamic dispersion hydraulic conductivity and porosity decrease steadily thereafter the biological blockage enters a stable phase during the same recharge process the main microorganisms in different stages of clogging will also change okubo and matsumoto 1983 found that the recharge process experienced three stages aerobic period aerobic anaerobic transition period and anaerobic period in the aerobic period bioclogging is controlled by the growth of aerobic microorganisms in the transition period microorganisms change from aerobic bacteria to anaerobic bacteria at this time the accumulation of microorganisms in the column is temporarily reduced and the permeability rate is almost unchanged or slightly increased after entering the anaerobic period the penetration rate decreases rapidly but in addition to the growth of anaerobic bacteria the gas barrier effect of the metabolic gas products also affects the permeability of the medium jiang et al 1998 oberdorfer and peterson 1985 although all effects occur under the action of microorganisms the microorganisms that specifically plug the pores at different times are also different at different times in the same system in different types of gars the main substances that cause clogging are also different due to different recharge conditions for example for partial recharge systems with intermittent infiltration characteristics the oxygen content in dry and wet infiltration media can be effectively restored which is more conducive to the growth of aerobic bacteria at this time substances that occupy pores mostly comprise aerobic bacteria and the epss secreted by these aerobic bacteria dutta et al 2015 3 factors affecting growth and metabolism of clogging microorganisms in gars with the stimulation of recharging water microorganisms will multiply and occupy pore channels which causes a sharp decrease in hydraulic conductivity in media these stimulations are mainly reflected in the water quality characteristics of the recharging water for example concentration of nutrients such as total organic carbon dissolved organic carbon doc nitrogen and phosphorus cunningham et al 2003 engesgaard et al 2006 in addition to the nutrient components the characteristics of porous media in the recharge system and various environmental conditions such as temperature and ph will also affect the growth and multiplication of microorganisms and secretion of epss environmental factors will significantly influence the characteristics of biofilms blanco et al 2019 the propagation of microorganisms and the development of biofilm will affect the seepage characteristics of porous media 3 1 characteristics of porous media the characteristics of porous media are the key factors for controlling microbial reproduction the growth of microorganisms is controlled by the surface area of a medium pavelic et al 2011 specifically the production of polysaccharides by microorganisms is limited by the surface area of a medium rather than the nutrient utilisation rate pavelic et al 2011 2007 microorganisms that produce polysaccharides can occupy the surfaces of soil particles and a larger surface area can be transformed into a higher microbial growth potential pavelic et al 2011 the content of polysaccharides is considered to be closely related to the decrease in the hydraulic conductivity ragusa et al 1994 rinck pfeiffer et al 2000 pavelic et al 2011 found via comparative experiments that the degree of clogging of a sand medium with high permeability is greater than the degree of clogging of a loam medium however in terms of formation time the experiments of perujo et al 2019 showed that the surface biological blockage was formed earlier in a fine sand medium than in a coarse sand medium compared with coarse sand fine sand has a higher surface area utilisation rate and lower flux which may be beneficial in the formation or attachment stage of the initial biofilm and the earlier formation of biofilm will lead to earlier surface biological clogging this early biofilm formation leads to an early stage of biofilm maturation thereby promoting the detachment of biomass from the upper layer and further colonisation in the topsoil the medium with a homogeneous grain size is conducive to the deep transport of biomass thus promoting deep biological clogging perujo et al 2019 bioclogging surface and deep in the monolayer fine system which is filled with only fine sand as a homogeneous medium was more serious than the bioclogging in a bilayer coarse fine system adding coarse sand to the surface layer perujo et al 2019 perujo et al 2019 analysed these types of systems and decided that this bioclogging may be due to a decrease in porosity and flux which leads to the formation of low cohesive biofilms in the monolayer fine system fang et al 2017 in such conditions biomass can be removed from the top layer transferred downward and accumulated in the medium so that new biomass may settle on the surface however in a two layer system the biofilm was still in the growth stage at this stage the biofilm detachment capability from the top sand layer was low and microbial activity was high with depth which leads to low bioclogging perujo et al 2019 therefore in practice the service life and efficiency of a recharge system can be improved by adjusting the surface medium characteristics by artificial measures 3 2 environmental conditions of recharge temperature can affect microbial activity le bihan and lessard 2000 and the secretion of epss in general the optimum temperature range for synthesis of epss by microorganisms is 26 31 c when the experimental temperature is lowered from 33 c to 15 c microbes will produce a stress response which will prompt them to secrete more epss at 10 c the metabolic activity of microorganisms will be severely inhibited and the content of epss will be significantly reduced song et al 2016 wilén et al 2008 compared the effects of different temperatures and found that the eps concentration and protein content extracted from sludge in winter increased significantly compared with those extracted from sludge in summer in addition to affecting the content and composition of epss tb epss accounted for the highest proportion of total eps at low temperatures 6 c and 10 c zhou et al 2016 however the increase in lb epss is the key factor that leads to the continuous decrease in the permeability coefficient xia et al 2014b xia 2015 therefore in the design of a recharge system it is necessary to consider the effect of temperature on microbial clogging during the process of recharge the ph determines the morphologies of cells when a medium is subjected to extreme ph conditions ph between 2 0 and 3 0 or ph 10 these extreme conditions will affect not only the growth of microorganisms but also the synthesis of epss and the presence of groups in epss which will make a difference in their environmental characteristics stredansky and conti 1999 lindsay et al 2000 generally the optimal ph for eps synthesis is between 5 5 and 6 5 lee et al 1999 in strongly acidic conditions ph 3 carboxylic acids polysaccharides phenols and protein peptide bonds in epss will decompose and disappear czaczyk and myszka 2007 however microorganisms will secrete more polysaccharides to counter this acid resistant condition li et al 2006 which redox reactions bacteria use to obtain energy depends on not only the available solutes but also the redox potential generated in porous media serpone 1996 in the case of insufficient carbon sources and nutrients an adequate combination of electron donor and electron acceptor is required to provide the energy needed for microbial growth thullner 2010 the redox potential in the environment will affect the synthesis and degradation of microbial polysaccharides which is conducive to the formation of blocking polysaccharides at extremely low potential while the degradation process of polysaccharides occurs only at positive potential nevo and mitchell 1967 the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the environment can affect the content of epss secreted by microorganisms during the sequencing batch reactor sbr cycle the eps content changes with the change in oxygen concentration for the conditions of high dissolved oxygen the content of polysaccharides in epss increases with time while the protein content remains unchanged for the condition of low dissolved oxygen the content of protein and polysaccharide in epss remain unchanged shin et al 2012 3 3 chemical composition of recharging water biomass is a measure of microbial cells in the biofilm community which largely depends on the water quality the biomass level is related to the content of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus in the water pavelic et al 2011 in an aquatic environment the synthesis of almost all extracellular enzymes is regulated by the nutrient utilisation rate kolehmainen et al 2009 therefore nutrient components affect not only microbial growth but also microbial metabolism and eps secretion when the glucose concentration in recharging water reaches 10 mg l the microorganism bacteria in the sand column will grow rapidly leading to serious clogging vandevivere and baveye 1992b however the increase in the glucose content will prolong the growth period of microorganisms and thus increasing the production of epss flemming and wingender 2001 the multifactor analysis results of xia et al 2014a also showed that the carbon source content was the most important factor affecting microbial secretion of epss in porous media and the composition of epss also differed with different nutrient contents in addition to the concentration of carbon sources the carbon to nitrogen ratio c n and the effect of the ratio of carbon to phosphorus will significantly affect the content of epss and the ratio of protein to polysaccharide ye et al 2011 xia 2015 in the experiments of vandevivere and baveye 1992b only in higher c n conditions can the epss secreted by microorganisms be observed in porous media via an optical microscope and scanning electron microscope epss will occur only when c n is high 77 and the hydraulic conductivity will be reduced however epss were not observed in the clogging at a low c n 39 therefore only for the condition of a high c n ratio can obvious bioclogging caused by eps occur since nutrient components are crucial to the growth of microorganisms and secretion of epss it is possible to reduce the degree of bioclogging or delay the occurrence of bioclogging by controlling the nutrient components in the recharging water page et al 2014b pointed out that when the doc concentration is 4 5 mg l biodegradable doc bdoc 0 2 mg l total nitrogen 0 3 mg l and residual chlorine 0 2 mg l these concentrations and the addition of the fungicide sodium hypochlorite naclo can effectively prevent the occurrence of bioclogging in the aquifer kim 2004 found that the hydraulic conductivity for the conditions of no nutrition and a freeze thaw cycle was 30 50 higher than the lowest hydraulic conductivity of the control group by inoculating bacteria and fungi in the sand and residual soil in addition to the nutrient components the presence of some metal ions can also affect the growth of microorganisms and the content of polysaccharides and proteins in epss however polysaccharides and proteins contribute differently during the microbial clogging process at a low dose 3 mmol l cu2 stress had no significant effect on the growth of p putida cz1 biofilm lin et al 2020 when the concentration of cu2 was 6 mg l copper could increase the protein production in epss but had a minimal effect on extracellular polysaccharides jian et al 2017 moreover for different kinds of metal stress the composition changes in epss secreted by microorganisms were also different for example under the stress of zn2 the polysaccharide content in epss increased significantly while the protein content in epss changed more significantly under cu2 stress jian et al 2017 4 impact of microbial activity on seepage in porous media 4 1 seepage state in media with microbial clogging the seepage characteristics of porous media refer to the characteristics of fluids seeping through the pores of the porous media which is commonly characterised by hydraulic conductivity and primarily depends on the size and connectivity of the pores of the media therefore the growth of microorganisms and the epss secreted by them will occupy a certain pore volume which will inevitably affect the absolute hydraulic conductivity of the media in the early stage of clogging the decrease in hydraulic conductivity may prolong the contact time between the water flow and the biofilm promoting the combination of nutrients in the water flow and microorganisms at the top of the clogging system and further aggravate the clogging murphy et al 1997 however due to the limitation of nutrient content the mass reproduction of microorganisms generally occurs in the tens of centimetres on the surface layer of the infiltration medium moreover with an increase in the infiltration distance the growth and decay of microorganisms will reach a dynamic equilibrium and the hydraulic conductivity will no longer increase in the saturated seepage conditions okubo and matsumoto 1979 huang et al 2009 the hydrodynamic conditions of porous media will affect the growth of microorganisms and the occurrence and development of internal bioclogging in the media murphy et al 1997 d ari and huisman 1983 found that when a large number of organisms existed in the water injection well increasing the water injection level would increase the microbial biomass accumulated near the surface layer per unit time and a further decrease in the surface hydraulic conductivity however the shear force of the biofilm attached to the surfaces of porous media particles has been found to increase with an increase in the flow rate a large shear force makes the biofilm on the particle surface more compact due to the small pore volume occupied by the dense biofilm per unit mass the decrease in the starting time of the hydraulic conductivity reduction is delayed and the speed of this reduction is also relatively slow kim et al 2010 on the other hand the larger shear stress will increase the detachment of the biofilm which will alleviate the degree of clogging to a certain extent however as a result of the migration of the biofilm after a certain distance the biofilm may still be redeposited in the pores which will change the pore size and connectivity of the deep medium this viewpoint is also considered one of the main factors that causes a decrease in the hydraulic conductivity in deep media metcalf 2002 the flow rate of recharge can affect the morphology and distribution of the biofilm formed by the microorganisms in a laminar flow environment the biofilms are patchy and consist of aggregates of rough cells separated by gaps membranes that are formed in turbulent conditions are also patchy but the surface has elongated streamers that oscillate in large amounts of fluid davey and o toole 2000 at medium flow rates the growth of biofilms is more evenly distributed in the pore space according to the size of the pores that are occupied and the grain distance ostvar et al 2018 the main factors that influence the growth of the biofilm are different at different flow rates in laminar flow conditions the growth of biofilms is limited by oxygen while in turbulent flow conditions the growth of biofilms is affected by shear stress ostvar et al 2018 microbial growth also reacts to the seepage process due to the large number of microorganisms that multiply in the near surface layer the hydraulic conductivity of the surface medium is significantly reduced compared with the hydraulic conductivity in the deeper part of the medium with the increase in depth there will be two seepage flow state areas water distribution zone saturated zone and water transmission zone unsaturated zone sometimes the depth range of the saturated area is only 3 5 cm darnault et al 2004 thus most of the seepage area is in an unsaturated state morales et al 2010 seifert and engesgaard 2012 and seki et al 2006 observed in their experiments that microbial clogging will lead to preferential flow which will gradually stabilise as the degree of clogging increases seifert and engesgaard 2012 along the preferential flow path the substrate availability and nutrient supply are the largest which leads to an increase in the bacterial biomass and related microbial activities and further exacerbates the bioclogging bundt et al 2001 therefore the formation of a preferential flow path may explain the formation of deep clogging rubol et al 2014 however it has not been determined whether the development of a preferential flow path is caused only by the combination of the bioclogging mechanism and the heterogeneous distribution of microorganisms or whether the development of a preferential flow path is simultaneously affected by other physical phenomena seifert and engesgaard 2012 when the pores are occupied by both water and air i e unsaturated seepage the capacity of water to pass through a medium is not only related to the pore size but also controlled by the proportion of water water content in the pore roberson and firestone 1992 used an electron microscope to observe that epss were soft and spongy in wet conditions but changed to a hard flat shape when dried which reveals the response of eps morphology to water content fig 2 morphological changes in epss in recent years epss have been found to have an obvious regulatory effect on soil water retention or et al 2007 adessi et al 2018 based on experiments deng et al 2015 observed that a small amount of epss and soil microstructure jointly inhibited the evaporation of pore water in the soil subsequently cruz et al 2017 also found that the aggregation state of epss and their hydrophilic hydrophobic characteristics on a surface were important factors for regulating the water spatial distribution namely hydraulic connectivity in the microscopic pore structure epss will increase the water holding capacity of a medium and their presence will cause the pore size to decrease under this dual influence the response of the water flow movement law especially the unsaturated flow state in porous media is a new problem to be solved 4 2 effects of microbial activity on physical and chemical clogging suspended particles are a common component in the recharging water source and there are many microorganisms in the recharging water source and porous media when suspended particles and microorganisms coexist their fate in porous media depends on their interaction with each other as well as the surface of the porous media the influence of microbial activity on the migration of suspended particles in porous media is shown in fig 3 the interaction of microorganisms and solid surfaces including suspended particles and porous media will affect the migration and sedimentation of coexisting suspended particles on the surface of porous media even at low eps concentration biofilm will change not only the hydraulic conditions but also the transport of colloidal particles in an underground environment leon morales et al 2007 in a short time microorganisms will combine with the solid surface of a medium by means of van der waals forces wang et al 2020 and then tightly and irreversibly adsorb on the solid surface under the action of other forces such as an electrostatic force flemming and wingender 2001 microorganisms that are attached to the medium surface and their epss can change the surface properties of the medium which may affect the migration of suspended particles in this medium when biofilm coats on a porous medium the surface roughness of the medium will increase and delay the migration of some particles in the medium and increasing their deposition in the medium for instance when the surface of a quartz sand porous medium is coated with biofilm the retention of biological selenium nanoparticles in the medium will be enhanced wang et al 2019 morales et al 2007 also observed that the presence of biofilm will slow the migration of laponite rd clay with a hectorite type structure colloidal particles in a quartz sand column and retention processes are linked to proteins in epss han et al 2016 found that the migration of zno nanoparticle aggregates zno nps in saturated quartz sand columns covered by biofilms was significantly reduced for plastic particles the presence of biofilm will increase the retention of three sizes of plastic particles 0 02 μm 0 2 μm and 2 μm in saturated quartz sand columns and increase the amount of deposition in low and high ionic strength conditions moreover three major components of epss protein polysaccharide and humus have contributions among which protein may have a dominant role when quartz sand is coated with biofilms biofilms will increase the surface roughness of the porous media and the oh and nh groups on the cell surface may form hydrogen bonds with carboxyl functionalised plastic particles jointly enhancing the deposition of plastic particles he et al 2020 therefore for this part of the particles microorganisms will slow the migration of the particles which will cause more particles to deposit on the porous medium accumulate and occupy the pore size of the medium reduce the permeability coefficient and increase physical clogging for some particles the presence of biofilm or epss can promote their migration in porous media compared with the migration in water saturated quartz sand poly vinylpyrrolidone stabilised silver nanoparticles pvp nags migrated faster and deposited less in the same sand coated with pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 biofilm mainly due to the electrostatic repulsion between the pvp coating on the particle surface and the epss mitzel and tufenkji 2014 for this part of the particles the presence of microorganisms will reduce the sedimentation of particles which may decrease the physical clogging rate microorganisms and their secreted epss may simultaneously interact directly with suspended solids affecting particle migration in the medium and further exacerbating physical clogging he et al 2015 roche et al 2017 as previously mentioned epss have a strong adsorption capacity and are excellent bioflocculants some microorganisms can flocculate solids such as kaolin clay and soil particles via bridging charge neutralisation and other functions aspergillus flavus can produce cationic independent bioflocculant and flocculate activated carbon kaolin and soil particles via charge neutralisation aljuboori et al 2015 the epss produced by serratia sp 1 have a strong flocculation capacity for kaolin and the flocculation activity of tb epss can reach 76 4 bezawada et al 2013 when the microbial content is high even a small amount of suspended particles will aggravate the clogging process pavelic et al 2011 wang et al 2020 when only cohesive soil is added clogging mainly occurs at the water inlet when microorganisms are mixed with cohesive soil surface and internal blockages occur compared with the case of only cohesive soil 100 mg l after adding microorganisms the microorganisms and cohesive soil will form agglomerates which will occupy the porous medium faster and accelerate the clogging rate the degree of clogging caused by the mixing of microorganisms and cohesive soil is approximately four times that of only cohesive soil cui 2020 bacteria colonise porous media to form biofilms which will affect the deposition of suspended particles the sedimentation of suspended particles will also provide a larger specific surface area promoting the adsorption of bacteria compared with the experimental group with only bacteria or suspended matter particles wang et al 2020 found that the hydraulic conductivity of porous media decreased more rapidly in a short time with the coexistence of bacteria and suspended matter moreover the main reason for the sharp decline in the permeability coefficient in the later stage was the influence of bacterial secretion of polysaccharides the polymerisation of polysaccharides was dominant among epss porous media and suspended particles in addition to the impact on physical clogging the change in the seepage state caused by a microbial community or microbial action will also affect the development of chemical clogging as clogging develops the microbial community in the environment will gradually change from aerobic bacteria to anaerobic bacteria in drinking water slow sand filters this transition can be conducive to carbonate deposition which will intensify the chemical clogging caused by the carbonate deposition mauclaire et al 2006 in addition to the change in the microbial community the process of biological clogging also causes a gradual change in the seepage state from saturated porous media to unsaturated porous media the abrupt change from the saturated state to the unsaturated state in an artificial recharge pool can produce significant geochemical changes including rapid oxidation of sulphide and dissolution of calcite greskowiak et al 2005 the hydraulic conductivity of the area where dissolution occurs may increase and have an unclogging effect on the other hand dissolution may lead to the release and migration of insoluble fine particles in the original pores after these particles are carried into the deep part they may cause further deep clogging martin ed 2013 thus microbial activity may have a significant impact on chemical clogging during this process 4 3 mathematical characterisation of bioclogging controlling and predicting aquifer bioclogging in the process of groundwater artificial recharge is the ultimate goal of an investigation of bioclogging this research is an important way to establish a mathematical model that is consistent with actual law the general idea of mathematical characterisation of bioclogging is that living and dead microorganisms and their epss will cover the surfaces of particles in media and occupy the pore space which causes a decline in media permeability the thickness of the biofilm or amount of biomass is determined by the balance between microbial substrate utilisation and the death of endogenous consumption the thickness of the biofilm or amount of biomass can be applied to further calculate the porosity change in the medium the relationship between porosity and the permeability coefficient is established and the model of permeability coefficient decrease is established therefore the biological clogging mathematical model includes two parts the first part involves describing the change in microbial biomass in porous media and the growth of biofilm the second part involves using the data output from the first part to study the decrease in the permeability coefficient vandevivere 1995 many scholars have conducted a considerable amount of research in this area and proposed various models in 1990 taylor and jaffé 1990 established the functional relationship between the permeability coefficient of porous media and microbial biomass based on one dimensional experimental results the model assumed that microorganisms existed in the media in the form of biofilm with equal thickness in 1995 vandevivere proposed a new model based on taylor s model the model proposed by vandevivere simultaneously assumes two conditions the microorganisms uniformly cover the medium pores in the form of biofilm and the microorganisms clog at one end in the form of colonies the model relaxes the assumption about uniformly thick biofilms however the model failed to predict the clogging behaviour observed in sand smaller than 1 mm vandevivere 1995 afterward clement et al 1996 proposed the concept of the micro model which suggested that microorganisms preferentially occupy larger pores in a medium and the spatial arrangement of the medium would not change due to the accumulation of microbial biomass during the clogging process only the maximum pore diameter would decrease the model makes no assumptions about the growth pattern of microorganisms and only uses the biomass data of particles seki and miyazaki 2001 defined the concept of colony enveloping space and mathematically expressed a nonuniform colony shape the model of seki and miyazaki assumes that microorganisms cover the surfaces of soil particles in the form of colonies and there is an equal thickness of colony envelope space on the surfaces of particles which is independent of the shapes of colonies thullner et al 2002a 2002b established a bioclogging prediction model for different microbial growth forms based on the microporous network model thullner s research shows that it is necessary to assume biomass growth in discontinuous colonies rather than a homogeneous biofilm and to include multi dimensionality effects on the pore scale thullner et al 2004 in 2013 rosenzweig et al 2013 proposed a modeling framework for variably saturated flows in porous media affected by biofilms using a pore network of triangular channels on this basis rosenzweig et al 2014 presented a framework for simulating the time dependent flow substrate transport and biofilm growth under variably saturated flows the current numerical simulations of bioclogging mostly involve the simulation of single bioclogging and there are few simulations of the combined effects of bioclogging and physical and chemical clogging the accuracy of predicting the occurrence and development of clogging needs to be improved 5 potential research gaps concluding remarks microorganisms exist widely in natural environments and their growth and metabolic activity have a significant impact on artificial recharge current research on the influence of microbial activity on artificial recharge is dedicated to the clogging effect of microorganisms in saturated seepage conditions there are still more research gaps regarding the clogging process of microorganisms under unsaturated seepage some achievements have been made on the characterisation of biofilm especially epss on the surfaces of solid particles in wastewater treatment and other fields however the mechanism of the activity of biofilm e g epss in artificial recharge is still not well understood through the previously mentioned induction and analysis further research can be carried out from the following aspects 1 the effects of microorganisms and their eps on the quality of recharging water in gars need to be further examined the role of epss secreted by microorganisms has been extensively investigated in farmland and sewage treatment however farmland research focusses on the role of epss in the soil water holding capacity or et al 2007 lehmann et al 2017 guo et al 2018 in the field of sewage treatment the physicochemical characteristics of epss showed significant dominant effects on the adsorption and degradation of heavy metals and toxic organic substances so the interaction mechanism between epss and pollutants has become the focus of attention in this field in recent years zhang et al 2014a 2014b mangwani et al 2017 zeng et al 2020 however the studies on microorganisms and epss in the artificial recharging process focuses on bioclogging and the effects of microorganisms and epss on the water quality of recharging water sources are rarely explored many chemical components are found in recharging water and the growth and metabolism of microorganisms as well as the adsorption and degradation characteristics of epss are likely to have an impact on the water quality of the recharging water 2 existing studies on the law of biological clogging between microorganisms and epss are carried out mainly with a background of saturated seepage however there are significant differences in the hydrodynamic and hydrochemical conditions between saturated conditions and unsaturated seepage conditions which will undoubtedly have a massive impact on the growth of microorganisms and the existence of epss therefore it is significant to explore the role of microbial flora and epss in porous media in unsaturated seepage conditions for a further understanding of the mechanism of bioclogging 3 microorganisms will further develop into the interior of a medium with water flow thus producing deposition deep in the medium and forming deep clogging the majority of current research on bioclogging is concentrated on the surface layer and few studies focus on the formation mechanism for deep clogging 4 microbial clogging will form preferential flow in gars few studies address the mechanism of preferential flow formation in unsaturated seepage conditions existing studies focus on the formation process of preferential flow with saturated seepage however for the condition of artificial recharge with large scale burial depth the water flow is characterised by an unsaturated seepage process the development of preferential flow in the unsaturated state will aggravate the degree of differentiation of hydrodynamic characteristics in the medium and the growth of microorganisms and their secretion as epss will facilitate a series of responses the change in the accumulation characteristics of microorganisms and epss in the preferential flow channel may further enable changes in the preferential flow channel which will hinder prediction of the bioclogging process and degree declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

4535,groundwater artificial recharge has been widely utilised throughout the world as an effective measure for solving groundwater overdraft many microorganisms are present in both recharging water and porous media and their metabolic activities inevitably have complicated effects on the recharge process bioclogging is attributable to the growing population of bacteria and their extracellular polymer substances secreted on the medium the formation mechanism of microbial clogging and the impact of microbial organisms on seepage were further reviewed the major factors that influence microbial clogging in the process of recharge are also discussed based on a literature review considering these problems the activities of microorganisms in different seepage conditions and the role of microbial extracellular polymeric substances epss in the recharging process are particularly addressed keywords groundwater artificial recharge microorganism extracellular polymeric substances clogging seepage characteristics 1 introduction driven by economic development groundwater overexploitation has caused increasingly serious and widespread environmental and geological problems such as land subsidence surface collapse ground fractures and seawater intrusion cui et al 2018 page et al 2014a in groundwater artificial recharge systems gars precipitation or surface water sources can be artificially infiltrated into a subsurface aquifer to supplement groundwater resources to effectively mitigate the geo environmental problems caused by groundwater overexploitation oaksford 1985 institute and unep 1998 lin et al 2020 gars have been widely employed throughout the world for decades pyne 1995 samadder et al 2011 bouwer 2002 however the recharge efficiency of the operating processes in recharge facilities has been greatly reduced or even scrapped in many cases due to clogging lindsey et al 1992 sun and miao 2001 among the 207 rainwater infiltration systems built in maryland in 1986 33 of them were scrapped due to clogging within two years operation and the number of infiltration systems out of service due to clogging increased to 50 in 1990 lindsey et al 1992 from 1981 to 2001 64 recharge systems have been built in beijing china and only 13 of these systems remained normal operation in the later stage but the remaining systems were also finally scrapped due to clogging sun and miao 2001 bloetscher et al 2014 analysed available data from 204 aquifer storage and recovery asr sites in the united states among them 11 stations were abandoned due to clogging and 18 stations were operational but encountered clogging problems clogging problems in gars can be divided into three categories according to their causes physical clogging chemical clogging and bioclogging olsthoorn 1982 physical clogging is caused mainly by the suspended solids in recharging water fetzer et al 2017 chemical clogging is caused mainly by chemical precipitation cui et al 2018 bioclogging is due mainly to clogging problems caused by microorganism growth production of extracellular polymeric substances epss and microbial activities baveye et al 1998 microorganisms are widespread in natural environments many microorganisms are present in recharging water and subsurface aquifers these microorganisms and their metabolic activities can significantly affect the hydraulic conductivity of porous media which can lead to bioclogging microbial activities can significantly reduce the permeability of the aquifer medium when the particle concentration in the recharging water is reduced by pre treatment the clogging caused by microbial activity will become more significant pavelic et al 2011 the decrease in the medium permeability caused by microorganisms is difficult to control and recover kim 2004 thullner 2010 in addition to the accumulation of microbial cells epss as viscous macromolecule polymers secreted by microbes play an important role in biological clogging arnon et al 2005 xia et al 2014a however under the influence of the recharging water quality and specific recharge conditions there are significant differences in the clogging bacteria and eps composition xia et al 2014b the specific clogging substances in the vertical infiltration profile vary with depth studies suggested that deep microbial clogging may be caused by surface biofilm shedding and migration metcalf 2002 deep biological clogging in a single medium system is considered closely related to the eps concentration perujo et al 2019 microbial activity will change the effective porosity reduce the internal permeability and affect the seepage characteristics of a medium morales et al 2010 microbial clogging can change the seepage state in the medium from saturated to unsaturated and preferential flow can be formed in the medium seifert and engesgaard 2012 seki et al 2006 the percolation hydraulic conditions can also influence the growth and settlement of microorganisms and the morphology and distribution of biofilm davey and o toole 2000 roberson and firestone 1992 microorganisms affect not only the seepage characteristics but also the occurrence and development of physiochemical clogging in porous media biofilms or epss have strong adsorption capacity their settling via adsorption on the surface of the medium can change the surface properties of the medium which will promote the settlement or migration of suspended particles from the recharging water demonstrating different properties on the medium surface he et al 2020 wang et al 2019 otherwise epss can directly combine with the suspended particles in the recharging water to increase the settlement of suspended solids and further aggravate physical clogging he et al 2015 roche et al 2017 in the process of microbial clogging the change in the microbial community can intensify chemical precipitation mauclaire et al 2006 a series of reactions such as mineral dissolution will also be triggered by the transition process from a saturated condition to an unsaturated condition greskowiak et al 2005 microorganisms and their metabolic activity can influence the characteristics of gars a series of factors such as porous media characteristics site environmental parameters recharge hydraulic conditions and hydrochemistry of recharging water will affect microbial growth and eps secretion therefore microorganisms and their metabolic activities are significant to the occurrence development and seepage process of clogging in gars based on research and analysis of growth and metabolic characteristics of common microorganisms in gars the factors that govern the growth and metabolic activities of microorganisms in artificial recharge conditions were undertaken the role and impact of microbial activity on seepage through porous media of gars and the relevant mathematical characterisation of bioclogging were discussed potential problems were identified and prospects for addressing the research gaps in this field were proposed for further in depth study 2 microbial growth and metabolism in gars 2 1 particularity of microbial growth and metabolism in gars there is some variety in terms for groundwater artificial recharge such as aquifer storage and recovery asr managed aquifer recovery mar and so on it is essentially the inclusion of more constituent elements with the development of artificial recharge for example asr addresses the process of water collection treatment and reuse dillon 2005 ringleb et al 2016 mar refers to groundwater recharge and storage in a broader sense including the indirect way of riverside exploitation to stimulate river channel to recharge groundwater dillon 2005 dillon et al 2010 ringleb et al 2016 however the effect of clogging on recharge mainly occurs in the part of groundwater infiltration regardless whatever terms in this paper gars specifically refers to this infiltration part of the gars operation after the recharging water is treated according to the manners of recharge it can be divided into surface infiltration and well injection as an active aquifer and storage management technology the main purpose of gars is to increase the reserves of groundwater therefore unlike farmland and sewage treatment gars have more stringent specifications on the quality of the recharging water and amount of water that enters groundwater bouwer 2002 dillon 2005 gale et al 2002 nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009 thus the growth and metabolism of microorganisms in gars has certain particularity which is embodied in the following aspects compared with other recharging water quality recharging water quality for gars is subject to strict standard requirements and the nutrient contents for gars is lower than that for other recharging water bouwer 2002 gale et al 2002 therefore the growth environment of microorganisms in gars is oligotrophic there are also strict requirements for the recharge site selection of gars the aquifer used for recharge generally possesses excellent permeability bouwer 2002 which intends to create an aerobic subsurface environment thus it is mainly the aerobic microorganisms that cause clogging problem this article tries to address the bioclogging caused by aerobic bacteria in addition the site selection of gars requires proper space for water storage sometimes referred as groundwater reservoirs the depth below surface of a recharge site is generally deep enough top space in the vadose zone which facilitates the unsaturated infiltration process in bioclogging the interactions between microorganisms and the seepage state in a recharge system and the influence of microorganisms on the formation of the preferential flows are discussed in the following sections 2 2 types of clogging microorganisms in gars bacteria are generally considered the main cause of medium bioclogging chapelle 1993 these bacteria may be derived from the microorganisms carried by recharging water zhang et al 2014a 2014b bai et al 2003 and are more likely to be the bacteria that are growing inside the infiltration medium the underground environment is considered to be the largest habitat of prokaryotes on earth whitman et al 1998 recharging water will be pretreated before recharge while the total number of bacteria in the groundwater extracted is generally greater than the total number of bacteria in the chemically treated water kolehmainen et al 2007 therefore the microbial content in the infiltration medium is much higher than the microbial content in the recharging water source microbial activity can significantly reduce the permeability of porous media the strict aerobic bacterium ak19 can reduce the hydraulic conductivity of a sand column by 3 to 4 orders of magnitude within 1 week vandevivere and baveye 1992b in some studies when the bacterial content exceeds 1 3 106 cfu g the hydraulic conductivity will be decreased by two orders of magnitude suleiman and swartzendruber 2003 arthrobacter methylobacterium purple bacillus and yersinia are involved in biological clogging vandevivere and baveye 1992a the characteristics of bioclogging are generally investigated via lab based simulation or field tests field tests can truly reflect actual environmental and hydrogeological conditions which is conducive to more accurate prediction and evaluation of the occurrence and development of bioclogging however due to the complexity of field conditions and the uncertainty of test conditions it is indeed difficult to obtain concise characterisation of bioclogging therefore current research on bioclogging is performed mainly in the laboratory column and sand tank experiments are the simplest most commonly used and most effective methods for investigating the clogging phenomenon according to previous studies the bacteria that can cause biological clogging including the main bacteria species that can cause bioclogging determined by a laboratory simulation experiment of artificial recharging biological clogging and the specific bacteria species selected to study the clogging mechanism in the experiment are listed in table 1 microbial activity can cause clogging in porous media which can lead to a reduction in the richness and diversity of a bacterial community hua et al 2018 2 3 growth process of microorganisms in porous media the decrease of medium permeability is closely related to the development degree of biofilm for example the development of biofilm in the surface layer of the basin will cause the surface conductivity of the basin to drop rapidly by more than three orders of magnitude masetti et al 2018 in the underground environment most bacteria attach to medium particles in the form of biofilms hazen et al 1991 the growth of biofilm on a solid surface can be divided into five stages stoodley et al 2002 otoole et al 2000 donlan 2001 fig 1 1 initial attachment of cells to the surface bacteria in a free state move near a solid wall surface and make contact with the wall surface after the bacteria are adsorbed on the solid wall surface they will fall off the solid wall surface due to the low adsorption strength 2 irreversible adhesion stage by secreting epss bacteria can firmly adsorb to the solid wall surface and attach more firmly to it bacteria begin to divide and form colonies 3 early development of biofilm architecture many bacteria divide and grow forming the early biofilm structure the biofilm community can develop considerable thickness and complexity via the nutrient exchange promoted by the biofilm structure and simultaneously keep a single cell in the optimal nutritional state in many locations of the biofilm 4 maturation of biofilm architecture with further development of the biofilm structure complex structures channels and pores are produced and bacteria are redistributed in the matrix which generally persists for a longer period 5 dispersion of single cells from the biofilm some bacteria detach from the mature biofilm and transform into free bacteria in gars the recharge rate and nutrient concentration can affect the growth of biofilms as they can be easily eliminated by high shear force at high recharge rate bioclogging at a low flow rate can be delayed for the time of local biofilm growths in narrow pore necks but the biofilm is rigid enough not to be sloughed kim et al 2010 dense biofilm will grow in high concentration solution kim et al 2010 2 4 characteristics of epss previous studies have shown that eps secretion is a general feature of microorganisms in the natural environment most microorganisms can secrete epss during the growth process flemming and wingender 2001 wingender et al 1999 some strains will lose the ability to secrete epss under laboratory conditions wingender et al 1999 thereby forming the aggregation of microorganisms and epss which is commonly known as biofilm more et al 2014 kokare et al 2009 bacterial biofilm is the main factor that causes bioclogging ragusa et al 1994 rinck pfeiffer et al 2000 in biofilm clogging research epss serve as an important adhesive for bacteria and can also protect microorganisms and provide them with a carbon source and energy in an oligotrophic environment comte et al 2006a frølund et al 1996 therefore the effect of epss on clogging is particularly prominent especially when microbial biomass is insufficient for causing bioclogging a large amount of epss secreted by microorganisms may cause clogging vandevivere and baveye 1992a 1992b 2002b thullner et al 2002a the chemical composition and structure of microbial epss are complex and related to the growth environment on the other hand the chemical composition and structure of microbial epss relates directly to extraction methods and conditions in general proteins and polysaccharides are the main eps components the proportions of proteins and polysaccharides in epss obtained from different studies slightly differ in early studies polysaccharides were regarded as the most important component of epss costerton et al 1981 however some studies have shown that extracellular polysaccharide is usually a trace component in environmental biofilm frølund et al 1996 protein is the main component of epss extracted from activated sludge zhang et al 2014a 2014b lin et al 2009 adav and lee 2008 wu et al 2009 in addition to proteins and polysaccharides epss also contain organic substances such as nucleic acids lipids humus and uronic acid among these organic substances the nucleic acid content is very small due mainly to cell lysis and release after microbial death liu and fang 2002 epss contain various groups including carboxyl amino and phosphate groups rijnaarts et al 1993 which are negatively charged in solution more et al 2014 prepared a detailed description of the role of each component in epss and its influence on the nature of epss in terms of eps structure classification researchers classified them into tight bound epss tb epss and loosely bound epss lb epss according to whether the structure is tightly wrapped outside of the cell a tb eps is situated in the inner layer closely bound to the cell surface and stably attached to the cell wall with a certain shape relatively speaking an lb eps is situated in the outer layer of a tb eps and has a relatively loose structure lb epss comprise a mucous layer that can expand to the surrounding environment without obvious edges and has a certain fluidity liu et al 2010 when bacteria are in the semi starvation or endogenous respiration phase they are generally believed to secrete high molecular weight polymers which belong to tb epss however when bacteria are in the logarithmic phase they will secrete low molecular weight polymers which are lb epss in adverse environments bacteria tend to produce more lb epss ye et al 2011 the contribution of these two eps layers with different structures in the formation of microbial clogging also differs xia et al 2016 epss have excellent adsorption capacity for metal ions and organic matter and a strong flocculation capacity as a very strong adsorbent the advantages of epss are mainly derived from two aspects epss have long chain linear structure as an adsorbent the linear structure can ensure that the adsorbent contains more binding sites jang et al 2001 zhang et al 2006 on the other hand numerous small functional groups such as amino carboxyl and hydroxyl groups are situated on the straight chain of epss hallstoodley et al 2004 these functional groups are the most preferential structures in most adsorption processes comte et al 2006b guibaud et al 2005 even when the microorganisms die functional groups such as carboxyl and hydroxyl groups may continue to function more et al 2014 yang and volesky 1999 in the artificial recharge process the functional groups on epss may adsorb suspended particles in the water source further aggravating the clogging in addition epss will adsorb components such as metal ions and organic matter and change the water quality of recharging water the existence of epss is significant for biofilms in artificial recharge conditions biofilms can obtain nutrients from flowing water der kooij et al 1995 and create potential adsorption sites for dissolved substances by producing hydrophilic epss flemming 1995 the production of the eps mucus matrix can provide support for the structure of the biofilm which largely determines the structure of the biofilm allison et al 2000 moreover the presence of epss can enhance cell deposition in porous media tong et al 2010 2 5 formation mechanism of bioclogging generally bioclogging occurs at the surface layer however in some cases such as when nutrient concentration is high and initial microbial distribution is low bioclogging may start from the middle or bottom layer seki 2013 baveye et al 1998 systematically concluded that the substances that clog pores with microbial action include four main categories accumulation of bacteria in porous media epss secreted by bacteria mainly due to the role of polysaccharides gases produced by microorganisms in life activities mainly ch4 and n2 and the accumulation of some sediments such as sulphides using microorganisms as a medium the latter two categories are caused mostly by the action of anaerobic bacteria ye et al 2009 xia 2015 it is commonly believed that the decrease in hydraulic conductivity in the initial stage of porous media during the formation of microbial clogging is caused mainly by the rapid growth and accumulation of microbial bacteria vandevivere and baveye 1992b wang et al 2020 the decrease in hydraulic conductivity in the later stage is closely related to the action of epss in the later stage numerous biofilms cover the cell surface in this stage the cells are strong enough to withstand convective transmission and form large aggregations via the eps link these cellular aggregates may clog pores or adhere to pore walls which causes reduced permeability of porous media vandevivere and baveye 1992a 1992b during this process the proportion of microorganisms such as sphingobacterium that secrete more polysaccharides in epss will increase wang et al 2020 significantly increasing the polysaccharide content in epss polysaccharides are the major substances that cause a decrease in the hydraulic conductivity in the later period therefore the same system will have completely different clogging behaviours due to different developmental rates of epss mauclaire et al 2004 in terms of eps structure the tb eps is considered to provide a carbon source and energy for bacterial cell survival with no significant effect on the reduction in medium hydraulic conductivity therefore in this process the lb eps contributes more than the tb eps vandevivere and baveye 1992a 1992b xia et al 2016 the content of different components and structures of epss comprise a key factor and important index for controlling the pore size of porous media allison 1947 the process of bioclogging is shown in fig 2 different indicators show many different divisions of the clogging stage according to the state of epss stewart and fogler 2001 divided clogging into three stages exopolymer induction phase plugging phase and plug propagation phase during the exopolymer induction phase the permeability of porous media decreased continuously but the range of the decrease was small in this stage the microbial colonies increase but are discontinuous and do not fill the pores of the medium with development of the colony the main characteristic of the plugging phase is that the hydraulic conductivity in the porous media decreases as the porosity is gradually filled during the plug propagation phase continuous clogging will occur in the direction of the water flow and biological colonies will further develop in the sand column according to the changes in the biochemical and hydraulic parameters during the clogging process zhong and wu 2013 divided the biological clogging process into four stages 1 aerobic microorganisms multiply rapidly at the entrance causing serious clogging 2 clogging develops within the whole sand column and hydrodynamic dispersion increases rapidly due to the propagation of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms 3 anaerobic microorganisms multiply rapidly produce more gas and rapidly reduce the hydrodynamic dispersion 4 both aerobic microorganisms and anaerobic microorganisms continue to multiply and the hydrodynamic dispersion hydraulic conductivity and porosity decrease steadily thereafter the biological blockage enters a stable phase during the same recharge process the main microorganisms in different stages of clogging will also change okubo and matsumoto 1983 found that the recharge process experienced three stages aerobic period aerobic anaerobic transition period and anaerobic period in the aerobic period bioclogging is controlled by the growth of aerobic microorganisms in the transition period microorganisms change from aerobic bacteria to anaerobic bacteria at this time the accumulation of microorganisms in the column is temporarily reduced and the permeability rate is almost unchanged or slightly increased after entering the anaerobic period the penetration rate decreases rapidly but in addition to the growth of anaerobic bacteria the gas barrier effect of the metabolic gas products also affects the permeability of the medium jiang et al 1998 oberdorfer and peterson 1985 although all effects occur under the action of microorganisms the microorganisms that specifically plug the pores at different times are also different at different times in the same system in different types of gars the main substances that cause clogging are also different due to different recharge conditions for example for partial recharge systems with intermittent infiltration characteristics the oxygen content in dry and wet infiltration media can be effectively restored which is more conducive to the growth of aerobic bacteria at this time substances that occupy pores mostly comprise aerobic bacteria and the epss secreted by these aerobic bacteria dutta et al 2015 3 factors affecting growth and metabolism of clogging microorganisms in gars with the stimulation of recharging water microorganisms will multiply and occupy pore channels which causes a sharp decrease in hydraulic conductivity in media these stimulations are mainly reflected in the water quality characteristics of the recharging water for example concentration of nutrients such as total organic carbon dissolved organic carbon doc nitrogen and phosphorus cunningham et al 2003 engesgaard et al 2006 in addition to the nutrient components the characteristics of porous media in the recharge system and various environmental conditions such as temperature and ph will also affect the growth and multiplication of microorganisms and secretion of epss environmental factors will significantly influence the characteristics of biofilms blanco et al 2019 the propagation of microorganisms and the development of biofilm will affect the seepage characteristics of porous media 3 1 characteristics of porous media the characteristics of porous media are the key factors for controlling microbial reproduction the growth of microorganisms is controlled by the surface area of a medium pavelic et al 2011 specifically the production of polysaccharides by microorganisms is limited by the surface area of a medium rather than the nutrient utilisation rate pavelic et al 2011 2007 microorganisms that produce polysaccharides can occupy the surfaces of soil particles and a larger surface area can be transformed into a higher microbial growth potential pavelic et al 2011 the content of polysaccharides is considered to be closely related to the decrease in the hydraulic conductivity ragusa et al 1994 rinck pfeiffer et al 2000 pavelic et al 2011 found via comparative experiments that the degree of clogging of a sand medium with high permeability is greater than the degree of clogging of a loam medium however in terms of formation time the experiments of perujo et al 2019 showed that the surface biological blockage was formed earlier in a fine sand medium than in a coarse sand medium compared with coarse sand fine sand has a higher surface area utilisation rate and lower flux which may be beneficial in the formation or attachment stage of the initial biofilm and the earlier formation of biofilm will lead to earlier surface biological clogging this early biofilm formation leads to an early stage of biofilm maturation thereby promoting the detachment of biomass from the upper layer and further colonisation in the topsoil the medium with a homogeneous grain size is conducive to the deep transport of biomass thus promoting deep biological clogging perujo et al 2019 bioclogging surface and deep in the monolayer fine system which is filled with only fine sand as a homogeneous medium was more serious than the bioclogging in a bilayer coarse fine system adding coarse sand to the surface layer perujo et al 2019 perujo et al 2019 analysed these types of systems and decided that this bioclogging may be due to a decrease in porosity and flux which leads to the formation of low cohesive biofilms in the monolayer fine system fang et al 2017 in such conditions biomass can be removed from the top layer transferred downward and accumulated in the medium so that new biomass may settle on the surface however in a two layer system the biofilm was still in the growth stage at this stage the biofilm detachment capability from the top sand layer was low and microbial activity was high with depth which leads to low bioclogging perujo et al 2019 therefore in practice the service life and efficiency of a recharge system can be improved by adjusting the surface medium characteristics by artificial measures 3 2 environmental conditions of recharge temperature can affect microbial activity le bihan and lessard 2000 and the secretion of epss in general the optimum temperature range for synthesis of epss by microorganisms is 26 31 c when the experimental temperature is lowered from 33 c to 15 c microbes will produce a stress response which will prompt them to secrete more epss at 10 c the metabolic activity of microorganisms will be severely inhibited and the content of epss will be significantly reduced song et al 2016 wilén et al 2008 compared the effects of different temperatures and found that the eps concentration and protein content extracted from sludge in winter increased significantly compared with those extracted from sludge in summer in addition to affecting the content and composition of epss tb epss accounted for the highest proportion of total eps at low temperatures 6 c and 10 c zhou et al 2016 however the increase in lb epss is the key factor that leads to the continuous decrease in the permeability coefficient xia et al 2014b xia 2015 therefore in the design of a recharge system it is necessary to consider the effect of temperature on microbial clogging during the process of recharge the ph determines the morphologies of cells when a medium is subjected to extreme ph conditions ph between 2 0 and 3 0 or ph 10 these extreme conditions will affect not only the growth of microorganisms but also the synthesis of epss and the presence of groups in epss which will make a difference in their environmental characteristics stredansky and conti 1999 lindsay et al 2000 generally the optimal ph for eps synthesis is between 5 5 and 6 5 lee et al 1999 in strongly acidic conditions ph 3 carboxylic acids polysaccharides phenols and protein peptide bonds in epss will decompose and disappear czaczyk and myszka 2007 however microorganisms will secrete more polysaccharides to counter this acid resistant condition li et al 2006 which redox reactions bacteria use to obtain energy depends on not only the available solutes but also the redox potential generated in porous media serpone 1996 in the case of insufficient carbon sources and nutrients an adequate combination of electron donor and electron acceptor is required to provide the energy needed for microbial growth thullner 2010 the redox potential in the environment will affect the synthesis and degradation of microbial polysaccharides which is conducive to the formation of blocking polysaccharides at extremely low potential while the degradation process of polysaccharides occurs only at positive potential nevo and mitchell 1967 the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the environment can affect the content of epss secreted by microorganisms during the sequencing batch reactor sbr cycle the eps content changes with the change in oxygen concentration for the conditions of high dissolved oxygen the content of polysaccharides in epss increases with time while the protein content remains unchanged for the condition of low dissolved oxygen the content of protein and polysaccharide in epss remain unchanged shin et al 2012 3 3 chemical composition of recharging water biomass is a measure of microbial cells in the biofilm community which largely depends on the water quality the biomass level is related to the content of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus in the water pavelic et al 2011 in an aquatic environment the synthesis of almost all extracellular enzymes is regulated by the nutrient utilisation rate kolehmainen et al 2009 therefore nutrient components affect not only microbial growth but also microbial metabolism and eps secretion when the glucose concentration in recharging water reaches 10 mg l the microorganism bacteria in the sand column will grow rapidly leading to serious clogging vandevivere and baveye 1992b however the increase in the glucose content will prolong the growth period of microorganisms and thus increasing the production of epss flemming and wingender 2001 the multifactor analysis results of xia et al 2014a also showed that the carbon source content was the most important factor affecting microbial secretion of epss in porous media and the composition of epss also differed with different nutrient contents in addition to the concentration of carbon sources the carbon to nitrogen ratio c n and the effect of the ratio of carbon to phosphorus will significantly affect the content of epss and the ratio of protein to polysaccharide ye et al 2011 xia 2015 in the experiments of vandevivere and baveye 1992b only in higher c n conditions can the epss secreted by microorganisms be observed in porous media via an optical microscope and scanning electron microscope epss will occur only when c n is high 77 and the hydraulic conductivity will be reduced however epss were not observed in the clogging at a low c n 39 therefore only for the condition of a high c n ratio can obvious bioclogging caused by eps occur since nutrient components are crucial to the growth of microorganisms and secretion of epss it is possible to reduce the degree of bioclogging or delay the occurrence of bioclogging by controlling the nutrient components in the recharging water page et al 2014b pointed out that when the doc concentration is 4 5 mg l biodegradable doc bdoc 0 2 mg l total nitrogen 0 3 mg l and residual chlorine 0 2 mg l these concentrations and the addition of the fungicide sodium hypochlorite naclo can effectively prevent the occurrence of bioclogging in the aquifer kim 2004 found that the hydraulic conductivity for the conditions of no nutrition and a freeze thaw cycle was 30 50 higher than the lowest hydraulic conductivity of the control group by inoculating bacteria and fungi in the sand and residual soil in addition to the nutrient components the presence of some metal ions can also affect the growth of microorganisms and the content of polysaccharides and proteins in epss however polysaccharides and proteins contribute differently during the microbial clogging process at a low dose 3 mmol l cu2 stress had no significant effect on the growth of p putida cz1 biofilm lin et al 2020 when the concentration of cu2 was 6 mg l copper could increase the protein production in epss but had a minimal effect on extracellular polysaccharides jian et al 2017 moreover for different kinds of metal stress the composition changes in epss secreted by microorganisms were also different for example under the stress of zn2 the polysaccharide content in epss increased significantly while the protein content in epss changed more significantly under cu2 stress jian et al 2017 4 impact of microbial activity on seepage in porous media 4 1 seepage state in media with microbial clogging the seepage characteristics of porous media refer to the characteristics of fluids seeping through the pores of the porous media which is commonly characterised by hydraulic conductivity and primarily depends on the size and connectivity of the pores of the media therefore the growth of microorganisms and the epss secreted by them will occupy a certain pore volume which will inevitably affect the absolute hydraulic conductivity of the media in the early stage of clogging the decrease in hydraulic conductivity may prolong the contact time between the water flow and the biofilm promoting the combination of nutrients in the water flow and microorganisms at the top of the clogging system and further aggravate the clogging murphy et al 1997 however due to the limitation of nutrient content the mass reproduction of microorganisms generally occurs in the tens of centimetres on the surface layer of the infiltration medium moreover with an increase in the infiltration distance the growth and decay of microorganisms will reach a dynamic equilibrium and the hydraulic conductivity will no longer increase in the saturated seepage conditions okubo and matsumoto 1979 huang et al 2009 the hydrodynamic conditions of porous media will affect the growth of microorganisms and the occurrence and development of internal bioclogging in the media murphy et al 1997 d ari and huisman 1983 found that when a large number of organisms existed in the water injection well increasing the water injection level would increase the microbial biomass accumulated near the surface layer per unit time and a further decrease in the surface hydraulic conductivity however the shear force of the biofilm attached to the surfaces of porous media particles has been found to increase with an increase in the flow rate a large shear force makes the biofilm on the particle surface more compact due to the small pore volume occupied by the dense biofilm per unit mass the decrease in the starting time of the hydraulic conductivity reduction is delayed and the speed of this reduction is also relatively slow kim et al 2010 on the other hand the larger shear stress will increase the detachment of the biofilm which will alleviate the degree of clogging to a certain extent however as a result of the migration of the biofilm after a certain distance the biofilm may still be redeposited in the pores which will change the pore size and connectivity of the deep medium this viewpoint is also considered one of the main factors that causes a decrease in the hydraulic conductivity in deep media metcalf 2002 the flow rate of recharge can affect the morphology and distribution of the biofilm formed by the microorganisms in a laminar flow environment the biofilms are patchy and consist of aggregates of rough cells separated by gaps membranes that are formed in turbulent conditions are also patchy but the surface has elongated streamers that oscillate in large amounts of fluid davey and o toole 2000 at medium flow rates the growth of biofilms is more evenly distributed in the pore space according to the size of the pores that are occupied and the grain distance ostvar et al 2018 the main factors that influence the growth of the biofilm are different at different flow rates in laminar flow conditions the growth of biofilms is limited by oxygen while in turbulent flow conditions the growth of biofilms is affected by shear stress ostvar et al 2018 microbial growth also reacts to the seepage process due to the large number of microorganisms that multiply in the near surface layer the hydraulic conductivity of the surface medium is significantly reduced compared with the hydraulic conductivity in the deeper part of the medium with the increase in depth there will be two seepage flow state areas water distribution zone saturated zone and water transmission zone unsaturated zone sometimes the depth range of the saturated area is only 3 5 cm darnault et al 2004 thus most of the seepage area is in an unsaturated state morales et al 2010 seifert and engesgaard 2012 and seki et al 2006 observed in their experiments that microbial clogging will lead to preferential flow which will gradually stabilise as the degree of clogging increases seifert and engesgaard 2012 along the preferential flow path the substrate availability and nutrient supply are the largest which leads to an increase in the bacterial biomass and related microbial activities and further exacerbates the bioclogging bundt et al 2001 therefore the formation of a preferential flow path may explain the formation of deep clogging rubol et al 2014 however it has not been determined whether the development of a preferential flow path is caused only by the combination of the bioclogging mechanism and the heterogeneous distribution of microorganisms or whether the development of a preferential flow path is simultaneously affected by other physical phenomena seifert and engesgaard 2012 when the pores are occupied by both water and air i e unsaturated seepage the capacity of water to pass through a medium is not only related to the pore size but also controlled by the proportion of water water content in the pore roberson and firestone 1992 used an electron microscope to observe that epss were soft and spongy in wet conditions but changed to a hard flat shape when dried which reveals the response of eps morphology to water content fig 2 morphological changes in epss in recent years epss have been found to have an obvious regulatory effect on soil water retention or et al 2007 adessi et al 2018 based on experiments deng et al 2015 observed that a small amount of epss and soil microstructure jointly inhibited the evaporation of pore water in the soil subsequently cruz et al 2017 also found that the aggregation state of epss and their hydrophilic hydrophobic characteristics on a surface were important factors for regulating the water spatial distribution namely hydraulic connectivity in the microscopic pore structure epss will increase the water holding capacity of a medium and their presence will cause the pore size to decrease under this dual influence the response of the water flow movement law especially the unsaturated flow state in porous media is a new problem to be solved 4 2 effects of microbial activity on physical and chemical clogging suspended particles are a common component in the recharging water source and there are many microorganisms in the recharging water source and porous media when suspended particles and microorganisms coexist their fate in porous media depends on their interaction with each other as well as the surface of the porous media the influence of microbial activity on the migration of suspended particles in porous media is shown in fig 3 the interaction of microorganisms and solid surfaces including suspended particles and porous media will affect the migration and sedimentation of coexisting suspended particles on the surface of porous media even at low eps concentration biofilm will change not only the hydraulic conditions but also the transport of colloidal particles in an underground environment leon morales et al 2007 in a short time microorganisms will combine with the solid surface of a medium by means of van der waals forces wang et al 2020 and then tightly and irreversibly adsorb on the solid surface under the action of other forces such as an electrostatic force flemming and wingender 2001 microorganisms that are attached to the medium surface and their epss can change the surface properties of the medium which may affect the migration of suspended particles in this medium when biofilm coats on a porous medium the surface roughness of the medium will increase and delay the migration of some particles in the medium and increasing their deposition in the medium for instance when the surface of a quartz sand porous medium is coated with biofilm the retention of biological selenium nanoparticles in the medium will be enhanced wang et al 2019 morales et al 2007 also observed that the presence of biofilm will slow the migration of laponite rd clay with a hectorite type structure colloidal particles in a quartz sand column and retention processes are linked to proteins in epss han et al 2016 found that the migration of zno nanoparticle aggregates zno nps in saturated quartz sand columns covered by biofilms was significantly reduced for plastic particles the presence of biofilm will increase the retention of three sizes of plastic particles 0 02 μm 0 2 μm and 2 μm in saturated quartz sand columns and increase the amount of deposition in low and high ionic strength conditions moreover three major components of epss protein polysaccharide and humus have contributions among which protein may have a dominant role when quartz sand is coated with biofilms biofilms will increase the surface roughness of the porous media and the oh and nh groups on the cell surface may form hydrogen bonds with carboxyl functionalised plastic particles jointly enhancing the deposition of plastic particles he et al 2020 therefore for this part of the particles microorganisms will slow the migration of the particles which will cause more particles to deposit on the porous medium accumulate and occupy the pore size of the medium reduce the permeability coefficient and increase physical clogging for some particles the presence of biofilm or epss can promote their migration in porous media compared with the migration in water saturated quartz sand poly vinylpyrrolidone stabilised silver nanoparticles pvp nags migrated faster and deposited less in the same sand coated with pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 biofilm mainly due to the electrostatic repulsion between the pvp coating on the particle surface and the epss mitzel and tufenkji 2014 for this part of the particles the presence of microorganisms will reduce the sedimentation of particles which may decrease the physical clogging rate microorganisms and their secreted epss may simultaneously interact directly with suspended solids affecting particle migration in the medium and further exacerbating physical clogging he et al 2015 roche et al 2017 as previously mentioned epss have a strong adsorption capacity and are excellent bioflocculants some microorganisms can flocculate solids such as kaolin clay and soil particles via bridging charge neutralisation and other functions aspergillus flavus can produce cationic independent bioflocculant and flocculate activated carbon kaolin and soil particles via charge neutralisation aljuboori et al 2015 the epss produced by serratia sp 1 have a strong flocculation capacity for kaolin and the flocculation activity of tb epss can reach 76 4 bezawada et al 2013 when the microbial content is high even a small amount of suspended particles will aggravate the clogging process pavelic et al 2011 wang et al 2020 when only cohesive soil is added clogging mainly occurs at the water inlet when microorganisms are mixed with cohesive soil surface and internal blockages occur compared with the case of only cohesive soil 100 mg l after adding microorganisms the microorganisms and cohesive soil will form agglomerates which will occupy the porous medium faster and accelerate the clogging rate the degree of clogging caused by the mixing of microorganisms and cohesive soil is approximately four times that of only cohesive soil cui 2020 bacteria colonise porous media to form biofilms which will affect the deposition of suspended particles the sedimentation of suspended particles will also provide a larger specific surface area promoting the adsorption of bacteria compared with the experimental group with only bacteria or suspended matter particles wang et al 2020 found that the hydraulic conductivity of porous media decreased more rapidly in a short time with the coexistence of bacteria and suspended matter moreover the main reason for the sharp decline in the permeability coefficient in the later stage was the influence of bacterial secretion of polysaccharides the polymerisation of polysaccharides was dominant among epss porous media and suspended particles in addition to the impact on physical clogging the change in the seepage state caused by a microbial community or microbial action will also affect the development of chemical clogging as clogging develops the microbial community in the environment will gradually change from aerobic bacteria to anaerobic bacteria in drinking water slow sand filters this transition can be conducive to carbonate deposition which will intensify the chemical clogging caused by the carbonate deposition mauclaire et al 2006 in addition to the change in the microbial community the process of biological clogging also causes a gradual change in the seepage state from saturated porous media to unsaturated porous media the abrupt change from the saturated state to the unsaturated state in an artificial recharge pool can produce significant geochemical changes including rapid oxidation of sulphide and dissolution of calcite greskowiak et al 2005 the hydraulic conductivity of the area where dissolution occurs may increase and have an unclogging effect on the other hand dissolution may lead to the release and migration of insoluble fine particles in the original pores after these particles are carried into the deep part they may cause further deep clogging martin ed 2013 thus microbial activity may have a significant impact on chemical clogging during this process 4 3 mathematical characterisation of bioclogging controlling and predicting aquifer bioclogging in the process of groundwater artificial recharge is the ultimate goal of an investigation of bioclogging this research is an important way to establish a mathematical model that is consistent with actual law the general idea of mathematical characterisation of bioclogging is that living and dead microorganisms and their epss will cover the surfaces of particles in media and occupy the pore space which causes a decline in media permeability the thickness of the biofilm or amount of biomass is determined by the balance between microbial substrate utilisation and the death of endogenous consumption the thickness of the biofilm or amount of biomass can be applied to further calculate the porosity change in the medium the relationship between porosity and the permeability coefficient is established and the model of permeability coefficient decrease is established therefore the biological clogging mathematical model includes two parts the first part involves describing the change in microbial biomass in porous media and the growth of biofilm the second part involves using the data output from the first part to study the decrease in the permeability coefficient vandevivere 1995 many scholars have conducted a considerable amount of research in this area and proposed various models in 1990 taylor and jaffé 1990 established the functional relationship between the permeability coefficient of porous media and microbial biomass based on one dimensional experimental results the model assumed that microorganisms existed in the media in the form of biofilm with equal thickness in 1995 vandevivere proposed a new model based on taylor s model the model proposed by vandevivere simultaneously assumes two conditions the microorganisms uniformly cover the medium pores in the form of biofilm and the microorganisms clog at one end in the form of colonies the model relaxes the assumption about uniformly thick biofilms however the model failed to predict the clogging behaviour observed in sand smaller than 1 mm vandevivere 1995 afterward clement et al 1996 proposed the concept of the micro model which suggested that microorganisms preferentially occupy larger pores in a medium and the spatial arrangement of the medium would not change due to the accumulation of microbial biomass during the clogging process only the maximum pore diameter would decrease the model makes no assumptions about the growth pattern of microorganisms and only uses the biomass data of particles seki and miyazaki 2001 defined the concept of colony enveloping space and mathematically expressed a nonuniform colony shape the model of seki and miyazaki assumes that microorganisms cover the surfaces of soil particles in the form of colonies and there is an equal thickness of colony envelope space on the surfaces of particles which is independent of the shapes of colonies thullner et al 2002a 2002b established a bioclogging prediction model for different microbial growth forms based on the microporous network model thullner s research shows that it is necessary to assume biomass growth in discontinuous colonies rather than a homogeneous biofilm and to include multi dimensionality effects on the pore scale thullner et al 2004 in 2013 rosenzweig et al 2013 proposed a modeling framework for variably saturated flows in porous media affected by biofilms using a pore network of triangular channels on this basis rosenzweig et al 2014 presented a framework for simulating the time dependent flow substrate transport and biofilm growth under variably saturated flows the current numerical simulations of bioclogging mostly involve the simulation of single bioclogging and there are few simulations of the combined effects of bioclogging and physical and chemical clogging the accuracy of predicting the occurrence and development of clogging needs to be improved 5 potential research gaps concluding remarks microorganisms exist widely in natural environments and their growth and metabolic activity have a significant impact on artificial recharge current research on the influence of microbial activity on artificial recharge is dedicated to the clogging effect of microorganisms in saturated seepage conditions there are still more research gaps regarding the clogging process of microorganisms under unsaturated seepage some achievements have been made on the characterisation of biofilm especially epss on the surfaces of solid particles in wastewater treatment and other fields however the mechanism of the activity of biofilm e g epss in artificial recharge is still not well understood through the previously mentioned induction and analysis further research can be carried out from the following aspects 1 the effects of microorganisms and their eps on the quality of recharging water in gars need to be further examined the role of epss secreted by microorganisms has been extensively investigated in farmland and sewage treatment however farmland research focusses on the role of epss in the soil water holding capacity or et al 2007 lehmann et al 2017 guo et al 2018 in the field of sewage treatment the physicochemical characteristics of epss showed significant dominant effects on the adsorption and degradation of heavy metals and toxic organic substances so the interaction mechanism between epss and pollutants has become the focus of attention in this field in recent years zhang et al 2014a 2014b mangwani et al 2017 zeng et al 2020 however the studies on microorganisms and epss in the artificial recharging process focuses on bioclogging and the effects of microorganisms and epss on the water quality of recharging water sources are rarely explored many chemical components are found in recharging water and the growth and metabolism of microorganisms as well as the adsorption and degradation characteristics of epss are likely to have an impact on the water quality of the recharging water 2 existing studies on the law of biological clogging between microorganisms and epss are carried out mainly with a background of saturated seepage however there are significant differences in the hydrodynamic and hydrochemical conditions between saturated conditions and unsaturated seepage conditions which will undoubtedly have a massive impact on the growth of microorganisms and the existence of epss therefore it is significant to explore the role of microbial flora and epss in porous media in unsaturated seepage conditions for a further understanding of the mechanism of bioclogging 3 microorganisms will further develop into the interior of a medium with water flow thus producing deposition deep in the medium and forming deep clogging the majority of current research on bioclogging is concentrated on the surface layer and few studies focus on the formation mechanism for deep clogging 4 microbial clogging will form preferential flow in gars few studies address the mechanism of preferential flow formation in unsaturated seepage conditions existing studies focus on the formation process of preferential flow with saturated seepage however for the condition of artificial recharge with large scale burial depth the water flow is characterised by an unsaturated seepage process the development of preferential flow in the unsaturated state will aggravate the degree of differentiation of hydrodynamic characteristics in the medium and the growth of microorganisms and their secretion as epss will facilitate a series of responses the change in the accumulation characteristics of microorganisms and epss in the preferential flow channel may further enable changes in the preferential flow channel which will hinder prediction of the bioclogging process and degree declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

4536,deforestation which removes soil protection by plant leafs and roots causes severe soil erosion since the beneficial effects of plant cover and root actions on soil erodibility are lost hydromulching has been found to be a suitable technique for erosion control but little research has been carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of hydromulch roots in controlling rill erosion in deforested areas due to overland flow this study has evaluated rill detachment capacity dc and erodibility kr which is the slope of the equation regressing dc and critical shear stress in hydromulched and bare plots 1 3 m long and 0 5 m wide on soils sampled in deforested hillslopes of northern iran the most important root parameters of the grass used for hydromulching were also measured such as root density and diameter dc has been measured in a laboratory flume under four bed slopes 10 15 20 and 25 and five water discharges 0 26 0 35 0 45 0 56 and 0 67 l m 1 s 1 with five replications per experiment dc was lower on average 44 with a minimum reduction of 40 at a slope of 25 and a maximum 50 at a slope of 15 in the hydromulched soils compared to the untreated plot dc was positively and negatively correlated with diameter and density of hydromulch roots respectively rill erodibility was noticeably lower 81 in the hydromulched soil compared to the bare plot by regressing dc on shear stress rill erodibility and critical shear stress for deforested hillslopes treated with hydromulching or left bare were given these parameters are useful to hydrologists in applications of physically

produce heavy impacts on forest ecosystems e g loss of biodiversity and productivity decaëns et al 2018 lucas borja and delgado baquerizo0 2019 and surrounding environments e g increased risks of flooding and infrastructure burial bradshaw et al 2007 soil erosion is a physical process that consists of detachment transport and deposition of soil particles nearing et al 1989 the initial phase of this complex process is detachment of particles from the soil matrix due to raindrop impact or overland flow govers et al 1990 aksoy and kavvas 2005 jiang et al 2020 soil particle detachment due to overland flow is different for inter rill and rill erosion processes zhang et al 2003 rill erosion is the most important erosive process on steep slopes owoputi and stolte 1995 wang et al 2014b where the erosion rates are generally higher compared to slopes with gentler profile zhang et al 2002 moreover rill development noticeably increases soil erosion rate and gully initiation with important implications on loss of fertile land and environmental impacts also on human settlements chaplot 2013 bryan and rockwell 1998 shen et al 2016 dube et al 2020 the maximum value of soil detachment due to rill erosion is known as rill detachment capacity foster 1982 govers et al 2007 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2009 liu et al 2019 zhou and zhang 2019 this is an important parameter for estimating rill erosion rate shen et al 2019 although rill erosion has been widely investigated in the last decades the study of this process and its influencing factors are still unclear shen et al 2016 moreover the effects of concentrated flow erosion have received limited attention in literature dube et al 2020 limiting soil detachment capacity by effective management practices is a key action to reduce the overall erosion rates since a low detachment capacity leaving soil particles in their original location decreases the amount of solid material that can be transported downstream by the overland flow the land management practices reducing soil detachment capacity are necessary in all environments and are of with particular importance in those deforested areas that are more exposed to runoff and soil erosion soil mulching which consist of covering bare soil with a protective layer mulch of organic e g crop residues or inorganic e g gravel plastic micro elements materials patil shirish et al 2013 prats et al 2017 has been found cheap and sustainable to limit runoff and erosion due to overland flow prosdocimi et al 2016 with regard to the organic mulch materials such as hay wood chips shredded paper grass and wood fibers have shown different levels of effectiveness in controlling soil erosion scholl et al 2012 ricks et al 2020 and even improving several soil properties de lima et al 2019 however soil conservation is most efficient when mulching is used in conjunction with living plant species tyner et al 2011 moreover mulching practices not only should be able to protect soil from detachment ettbeb et al 2020 but should also enhance growth and survival of new plants mulching with these functions would be ideal to prevent soil erosion in delicate ecosystems mccullough and endress 2012 where the vegetal cover and plant biodiversity are scarce parhizkar et al 2020a 2020b 2020c this is the case of hydromulching a viable practice that has been very successfully used to rehabilitate degraded soil in the whole world theoretically hydromulching consists of spraying a slurry of seed water fertilizer binding agents super absorbents fiber mulch and green dye on soil surface bautista et al 2009 dodson and peterson 2009 parsakhoo et al 2018a hydromulch creates an absorbent layer by the sprayed fertilizers and grass seeds on the soil surface and has a strong influence on runoff and erosion rates holt et al 2005 babcock and mclaughlin 2013 ricks et al 2020 it is well known how a grass cover of soil reduces runoff and soil loss li et al 2011 trapping sediments transported by the surface runoff as a mechanical barrier parsakhoo et al 2018b moreover a root mat is formed by grasses in hydromulched soil fox et al 2010 and these roots greatly reduced soil detachment capacity wang et al 2018a 2018b parhizkar et al 2020a 2020b 2020c the application of hydromulch on soil surface is therefore effective for soil conservation ricks et al 2020 parsakhoo et al 2018a and beneficial for vegetation recovery lucas borja et al 2020 several studies have reported how and by what extent hydromulching can effectively reduce water runoff and soil erosion prats et al 2013 ricks et al 2020 ettbeb et al 2020 for instance eck et al 2010 showed that hydromulching reduced the sediment yield by about 75 in comparison with bare plots at a quarry in parker county usa parsakhoo et al 2018a applied hydromulch and several herbal seeds to artificial soil slopes of forest roads in iran showing significant reduction by at least 50 in soil erosion rates compared to non mulched plots according to mclaughlin and brown 2006 hydromulching based on addition of polyacrylamide reduces water turbidity and soil loss by about 85 in comparison to bare soil despite the abundant literature about the effects of hydromulching on soil erosion the studies focusing its effectiveness in controlling rill erosion when applied in deforested areas are lack rill erosion due to overland flow is the most important erosive process on steep slopes owoputi and stolte 1995 wang et al 2014b and its control is essential after deforestation moreover information regarding the effects of hydromulch roots on rill detachment capacity and erodibility is scarce to fill this gap this study evaluates the changes in rill detachment capacity due to hydromulching in deforested hillslopes more specifically the rill detachment capacity of soils subjected to hydromulching or left bare was measured in a laboratory flume at different water discharges and bed slopes moreover the root characteristics of the hydromulch that mostly influence rill detachment capacity were analyzed moreover regression models are suggested to predict rill erodibility from soil detachment capacity on both hydromulched and bare soils the quantitative data and prediction models obtained in this study can provide insights about the effectiveness of hydromulching in deforested lands where the need for soil conservation is mandatory 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was carried out on soil samples collected in a forestland of guilan province northern iran located near rasht city geographic coordinates 37 08 04 n 49 39 44 e fig 1 deforestation has been severe for many years in the forest areas of northern iran kelarestaghi et al 2006 gholoubi et al 2019 parhizkar et al 2020a several hillslopes in this area were deforested to install high voltage power towers and deforestation has determined the loss of almost all the vegetation parhizkar et al 2020b 2020c the loss of biodiversity and increase in soil erosion have been the most important consequences of deforestation the deforested site selected in this study because of its susceptibility to rill erosion parhizkar et al 2020c has an elevation ranging from 50 to 250 m above the mean sea level the area has a typical mediterranean climate csa type according to the köppen geiger classification kottek et al 2006 the mean annual temperature and precipitation are 16 3 c and 1360 mm respectively irimo 2016 the soil has a silty clay loam texture sdsd 2017 with sand silt and clay contents of 12 8 0 44 47 8 0 46 39 3 0 21 respectively the organic matter content is 1 94 0 36 while the bulk density is 1554 61 7 kg m 3 and aggregate stability in water is 0 96 0 18 n 24 samples measurement methods reported in parhizkar et al 2020c 2 2 soil sampling and plot preparation samples of deforested soils were randomly collected from the top layer 0 to 20 cm between june and september 2019 according to the procedure by geng et al 2017 litter weeds and rocks were removed from soil before sampling then the samples were collected and transported to the soil testing laboratory of the college of agriculture guilan university iran here the soil was air dried and sieved through a 2 mm mesh the sampled soil was placed in two experimental plots made of timber planks length of 1 3 m and width of 0 5 m with 0 1 m high sides shoemaker 2009 singh sidhu 2015 ricks et al 2020 the soil of the first plot was subjected to hydromulch spraying on the surface fig 2 a while the first plot was left bare and assumed as control this allows the comparison between deforested and hydromulched or bare soils then the soil was wetted until saturation and maintained under a tarpaulin cover for 24 h geng et al 2017 2 3 hydromulch characteristics and application methods hydromulch material was produced using a mixture of water grass seed organic binder starter fertilizer cellulose fiber bio humus super absorbent and green dye these native materials were blended in the mixture according to the hydromulching international protocol sheldon and bradshaw 1997 albaladejo montoro et al 2000 fox et al 2010 parsakhoo et al 2018a seeds of zoysia grass which is a grass growing in the warm season and has a deep root system beiraghdar et al 2014 were selected for this study the hard leaves and deep roots of this grass make a dense vegetal cover on the soil surface soroush et al 2008 organic materials were added to the hydromulch as binding agents of soil particles in order to stabilize the soil aggregates sheldon and bradshaw 1997 parsakhoo et al 2018a to enhance the germination rapidity of the grass seeds cellulose fiber and bio humus as absorbent mats were also used holt et al 2005 dodson and peterson 2009 babcock and mclaughlin 2013 finally starter fertilizer and super absorbent were added to provide food for the growing seedlings and increase the water holding capacity of soil respectively parsakhoo et al 2018b abdallah 2019 according to the doses used in previous works properly scaled to consider the size of the plots holt et al 2005 ricks et al 2020 the hydromulch was applied at 410 kg ha 1 in 4 l water 2 4 soil sampling in hydromulched plots and characterisation of hydromulch roots once grass grew in the hydromulched plots fig 2b its leaves were removed from the soil surface using scissors then the soil samples were extracted along with their roots using a steel ring diameter of 0 1 m and height of 0 05 m parhizkar et al 2020a 2020b 2020c khanal and fox 2017 an additional hydromulched plot with the same characteristics as above was used to measure the grass root characteristics the roots were sampled from different parts of this plot after six months from planting and twenty samples were achieved see section 2 7 the diameter length biomass and weight density of grass roots were measured the length and diameter were determined using a universal tape meter and a vernier caliper respectively to measure the root biomass the samples were first oven dried at 60 c for 48 h then the dried samples were weighted for several times until a constant value root weight density was measured by the washing method over a 1 mm sieve and subsequent oven drying at 65 c for 24 h 2 5 simulation of rill detachment by overland flow rill detachment was simulated on samples collected in both plots deforested and hydromulched as well as deforested and bare soils using a hydraulic flume length of 3 5 m with a rectangular cross section width of 0 2 m fig 2c the soil was collected from each plot using a steel ring with diameter of 0 1 m and height of 0 05 m then the sample surface was sprayed with water and then inserted in the flume bed after excavating a hole of the same size as the ring about 0 5 m upstream of its outlet then the bed slope of the flume was adjusted at the desired value and the water discharge was set see section 2 7 dosing water into the flume from an upstream tap the water discharge was measured in five replications using a graduated cylinder moreover the surface water velocity was determined measured in ten replications using the fluorescent dye technique the average value was the product of the measured water velocity by coefficients of 0 6 0 7 or 0 8 for laminar transitional or turbulent flow respectively abrahams et al 1985 a level probe accuracy of 1 mm was used to measure the water depth this measurement was carried out in six replications in two cross sections 0 4 m and 1 m from the flume outlet and three points per section in the center as well as at 0 01 m from the left and right sides of the flume each experiment was stopped when the depth of the eroded soil in the steel ring was 0 015 m or after five minutes after each experiment the soil dry weight was determined oven drying the wet soil sample for 24 h at 105 c more details about the flume characteristics and the experimental procedure can be found in parhizkar et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2 6 measurement of rill detachment capacity and erodibility the mean rill detachment capacity dc kg s 1 m 2 was calculated by averaging the individual values of the replicated experiments for each water discharge and bed slope of the flume using equation 1 1 d c δ m a δ t in eq 1 δm is the dry weight of detached soil kg a is the area of the soil sample m2 and δt is experiment duration s rill erodibility kr s m 1 and critical shear stress τc pa are important parameters used as input in process based erosion models wang et al 2016 such as the water erosion prediction project wepp nearing et al 1989 both parameters are indicators of soil resistance to rill erosion in this study rill erodibility and critical shear stress were calculated from the regression equation 2 that interpolates shear stress τ pa foster 1982 and rill detachment capacity 2 d c k r τ τ c kr and τc are the slope and intercept of eq 2 shear stress was calculated in accordance with equation 3 proposed by several authors nearing et al 1997 3 τ ρ g r s in this equation r is the hydraulic radius m ρ is the water density kg m 3 g is the gravity acceleration m s 2 and s is the bed slope m m 1 parhizkar et al 2020a the hydraulic radius is calculated by equation 4 4 r h p 2 p h where h is the depth and p is the width of the water flow in m table 1 sd shows the values of h r and τ of the experiments simulating the rill detachment process at each water discharge and bed slope in the flume 2 7 experimental design an experiment of rill detachment was simulated for each soil condition deforested and bare soil hereinafter db and deforested and hydromulched soil dh at five water discharges 0 26 0 35 0 45 0 56 and 0 67 l m 1 s 1 and four bed slopes 10 15 20 and 25 the latter values are similar to the slopes of the forests of the experimental area between 7 and 8 and 20 22 or slightly more each experiment consisted of five replicates overall 200 soil samples 2 condition 5 water discharges 4 bed slopes 5 replications were subjected to rill detachment simulation data of hydromulch root characterization were coupled to data of flume experiment as follows the 100 soil samples for flume experiment one for each of five water discharges and four bed slopes each in five replications were collected from the first hydromulched plot as many samples were collected from the second hydromulched plot for root characterization choosing the same positions as the previous samples all pairs of samples were marked for identification twenty composite samples of soil collected in the second plot were achieved by mixing the five samples for each water discharge and bed slope 2 8 statistical analysis a paired sample t test evaluated the statistical significance of the differences in the rill detachment capacity dependent variable between soil conditions independent variables at p level 0 05 the normality of sample distribution was checked using qq plots when the assumptions of the statistical tests were not satisfied the data were square root transformed pearson s matrix was calculated to identify possible correlations among dc and the root characteristics of hydromulch all statistical analyses were carried out using xlstat 9 0 software addinsoft paris france 3 results 3 1 characteristics of hydromulch roots the soil samples contained hydromulch roots with a diameter between 0 61 and 0 79 mm with an average value of 0 69 0 06 mm table 1 the root length was in the range 12 6 22 5 cm while its mean was equal to 17 3 cm the mean root biomass was 22 29 3 08 g while the lowest and highest values were 17 12 and 27 73 g the root weight density was between 0 31 and 0 76 kg m 3 its mean value was 0 54 0 12 kg m 3 table 1 3 2 variations of rill detachment capacity between soil conditions the rill detachment capacity in dh soils was significantly p 0 05 lower compared to the db plot as shown in fig 3 dc was on the average 0 027 kg m 2 s 1 in dh plots a 1 5 fold value compared the db soils 0 047 kg m 2 s 1 also the variability of dc was lower in dh soils as shown by the lower standard deviation 0 013 kg m 2 s 1 vs 0 024 kg m 2 s 1 measured in the db plot fig 3 3 3 analysis of the relationships between rill detachment capacity and root characteristics the pearson s matrix shows that dc was positively correlated with root diameter r 0 593 p 0 05 and negatively correlated with root weight density r 0 566 p 0 05 a negative correlation but not significant p 0 05 was also found between diameter and weight density of hydromulch roots r 0 529 table 2 3 4 relationships between rill detachment capacity and shear stress and estimation of rill erodibility the regression analysis applied to dc and τ using equation 2

91 pa fig 4 4 discussions 4 1 influence of hydromulching on rill detachment capacity in this study the deforested soils subjected to hydromulching or left bare had the same characteristics such as the soil type and texture and experienced the same water discharges and bed slopes in the experiments therefore the effects of hydromulching and especially the root characteristics can explain alone the changes in rill detachment capacity and erodibility between the treatment and the control plots previous studies have demonstrated that the conservation techniques based on hydromulching are able to significantly reduce soil loss in several environmental conditions e g hubbert et al 2012 prats et al 2013 parsakhoo et al 2018a ricks et al 2020 the results of the experiments carried out in the current investigation are in accordance to these studies as a matter of fact hydromulching reduced on the average rill detachment capacity by 44 compared to the bare soil with a peak of 54 for the minimum values of rill detachment capacity this reduction let us think that also soil loss although not directly measured in these experiments can be lower in hydromulched soils compared to bare soil this reduction may be expected since robichaud et al 2000 reported that hydromulching is able to control erosion in the short term because its application enhances a vegetation cover with a dense root system conversely other studies have demonstrated that the vegetal cover might be insignificant for the prevention and control of rill erosion de baets et al 2007 wang et al 2014a the correlation analysis helps to explain which characteristics of the hydromulch roots play a greater influence on the observed reduction in rill detachment capacity this statistical technique has identified significant correlations between rill detachment capacity on one side and weight density and diameter of roots on the other side more specifically when root weight density decreases rill detachment capacity increases root weight density is an important indicator of the ability of plants at reducing soil detachment yoshinori et al 2016 parhizkar et al 2021 conversely in soils with higher root diameter rill detachment capacity is higher also other studies have found positive correlations between some parameters related to soil resistance to concentrated erosion and root characteristics e g li et al 1992 wang et al 2015 wang and zhang 2017 the reduction in rill detachment capacity measured in deforested and hydromulched soils may be ascribed to two factors that is weight density and diameter of roots in vegetation cover first it is well known that soils with a prominent vegetation cover show higher root weight density parhizkar et al 2020c in press this parameter identified by the correlation analysis among the root characteristics that mostly influence rill detachment capacity determines a beneficial effect reducing soil detachability li et al 2015 and thus on soil s resistance to particle detachment the direct association between rill detachment capacity and root weight density is in accordance with findings of many authors e g zhang et al 2013 li et al 2015 wang et al 2015 these studies state that increases in root weight density are effective in reducing the soil detachability among the other studies reporting similar impacts of the plant roots in reducing soil detachment e g li et al 1991 li 1995 and specifically in controlling rill erosion gyssels et al 2005 it is interesting to notice that zhang et al 2013 reported an exponential decrease in soil detachment capacity with the increase in root weight density however this law has not been confirmed in our study which found a coefficient of determination of only 0 20 in regressing rill detachment capacity with root weight density data not shown second the root diameter is the other characteristic of root hydromulch that mostly influences rill detachment capacity in the hydromulched soil root diameter was lower than one mm in all experiments and this size was effective in reducing rill detachment capacity compared to the bare soil without grass roots this size is in accordance with findings of many authors e g de baets et al 2006 2007 loades et al 2010 leung et al 2015 li et al 2015 who reported that roots with diameter less than one mm are effective in controlling concentrated flow and protecting soil from rill detachment with clear reduction in hillslope erodibility conversely khanal and fox 2017 showed that erosion rates at high shear stress decrease with increasing root diameter unexpectedly the influence of the other root characteristics length and biomass on rill detachment capacity was not evidenced by this study the scarce influence of root length on soil erodibility may be justified by the fact that the detachment of soil particles is a surface process whereas grass roots mainly penetrate in the sub surface layer of soil rather than extending on its surface yoshinori et al 2016 the absence of biomass effects on soil detachability can be explained by the low time elapsed from the hydromulch application to the experiment organic matter supplied by biomass needs more time to degrade and play beneficial effects on soil structure such as aggregation properties lucas borja et al 2018 the role of these factors can be instead expected in other land uses different from deforested areas for example parhizkar et al 2020a reported that vegetation cover with the effects of its roots can help to reduce soil detachment in forestland and woodland of northern iran 4 2 influence of hydromulching on rill erodibility literature studies have clearlydemonstrated that rill detachment rate and erodibility depend on plant root characteristics mamo and bubenzer 2001a 2001b de baets and poesen 2010 gyssels et al 2006 as shown for rill detachment capacity this study has demonstrated that grass roots are able to decrease rill erodibility in hydromulched soils for bare soil rill erodibility was 1 8 times greater than the value of the hydromulched plot while the ratio of τc measured in db and dh soils was close to one this result is consistent with the studies by mamo and bubenzer 2001a mamo and bubenzer 2001b who found that rill erodibility decreases by an exponential law in soils with living plant root moreover li et al 1991 showed that the decrease in rill detachment capacity and erodibility of soil under concentrated flow is more pronounced if roots have a diameter lower than one mm as in this study and this root size is known as effective root diameter the regression model between rill detachment capacity and shear stress proposed in this study is very accurate for both bare and hydromulched soils r2 0 90 this is accuracy is in close accordance with zhang et al 2008 who found coefficients of determination up to 0 90 for equations interpolating rill detachment capacity and shear stress under different land uses it is interesting to note that the erodibility estimated for the hydromulched plot is lower compared to the values measured in grasslands in a previous work parhizkar et al 2020a this can be explained by the disturbance effects on the deforested soils on which rill erodibility was estimated in the current experiments this result is consistent with the findings of zhang et al 2003 who demonstrated that disturbed soils can be more easily detached under overland flow due to the destruction of soil structure the values of rill erodibility and critical shear stress suggested by the present study are useful to help land managers to simulate the hydrological impacts of soil conservation measures such as hydromulch application in deforested areas in order to reduce the erosion risk as a matter of fact rill erodibility and critical shear stress are the most important parameters reflecting the soil resistance to rill erosion nearing et al 1989 therefore accurate values for these parameters are essential to achieve reliable predictions of erosion by applying physically based erosion models wang et al 2016 such as the water erosion prediction project wepp laflen et al 1991 5 conclusions this study has evaluated rill detachment capacity in hydromulched and untreated plots through flume experiments on soils sampled in deforested hillslopes of northern iran rill detachment capacity in the hydromulched soil was significantly lower compared to the bare plot dc was positively and negatively correlated with diameter and density of hydromulch roots respectively rill erodibility was noticeably lower 81 in the hydromulched soil compared to the bare plot these outcomes show the effectiveness of hydromulch roots with lower diameter and higher weight density in reduceing rill detachment capacity moreover by regressing rill detachment capacity on shear stress upon the measurements rill erodibility and critical shear stress for deforested hillslopes treated with hydromulching or left bare were given these regression models and values help hydrologists in applications of erosion models to reduce erosion rates in deforested hillslopes funding faculty of

4536,deforestation which removes soil protection by plant leafs and roots causes severe soil erosion since the beneficial effects of plant cover and root actions on soil erodibility are lost hydromulching has been found to be a suitable technique for erosion control but little research has been carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of hydromulch roots in controlling rill erosion in

and bare plots 1 3 m long and 0 5 m wide on soils sampled in deforested hillslopes of northern iran the most important root parameters of the grass used for hydromulching were also measured such as root density and diameter dc has been measured in a laboratory flume under four bed slopes 10 15 20 and 25 and five water discharges 0 26 0 35 0 45 0 56 and 0 67 l m 1 s 1 with five replications per experiment dc was lower on average 44 with a minimum reduction of 40 at a slope of 25 and a maximum 50 at a slope of 15 in the hydromulched soils compared to the untreated plot dc was positively and negatively correlated with diameter and density of hydromulch roots respectively rill erodibility was noticeably lower 81 in the hydromulched soil compared to the bare plot by regressing dc on shear stress rill erodibility and critical shear stress for deforested hillslopes treated with hydromulching or left bare were given these parameters are useful to hydrologists in applications of physically

management practices are important reasons of soil erosion one of the most serious problem in the global environment zhao et al 2019 and more generally of degradation of its quality lucas borja et al 2019 shabanpour et al 2020 when the vegetal cover of forests is removed runoff generation and soil erosion increase fao 2000 cherubin et al 2017 parhizkar et al 2020a 2020b 2020c these processes produce heavy impacts on forest ecosystems e g loss of biodiversity and productivity decaëns et al 2018 lucas borja and delgado baquerizo0 2019 and surrounding environments e g increased risks of flooding and infrastructure burial bradshaw et al 2007 soil erosion is a physical process that consists of detachment transport and deposition of soil particles nearing et al 1989 the initial phase of this complex process is detachment of particles from the soil matrix due to raindrop impact or overland flow govers et al 1990 aksoy and kavvas 2005 jiang et al 2020 soil particle detachment due to overland flow is different for inter rill and rill erosion processes zhang et al 2003 rill erosion is the most important erosive process on steep slopes owoputi and stolte 1995 wang et al 2014b where the erosion rates are generally higher compared to slopes with gentler profile zhang et al 2002 moreover rill development noticeably increases soil erosion rate and gully initiation with important implications on loss of fertile land and environmental impacts also on human settlements chaplot 2013 bryan and rockwell 1998 shen et al 2016 dube et al 2020 the maximum value of soil detachment due to rill erosion is known as rill detachment capacity foster 1982 govers et al 2007 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2009 liu et al 2019 zhou and zhang 2019 this is an important parameter for estimating rill erosion rate shen et al 2019 although rill erosion has been widely investigated in the last decades the study of this process and its influencing factors are still unclear shen et al 2016 moreover the effects of concentrated flow erosion have received limited attention in literature dube et al 2020 limiting soil detachment capacity by effective management practices is a key action to reduce the overall erosion rates since a low detachment capacity leaving soil particles in their original location decreases the amount of solid material that can be transported downstream by the overland flow the land management practices reducing soil detachment capacity are necessary in all environments and are of with particular importance in those deforested areas that are more exposed to runoff and soil erosion soil mulching which consist of covering bare soil with a protective layer mulch of organic e g crop residues or inorganic e g gravel plastic micro elements materials patil shirish et al 2013 prats et al 2017 has been found cheap and sustainable to limit runoff and erosion due to overland flow prosdocimi et al 2016 with regard to the organic mulch materials such as hay wood chips shredded paper grass and wood fibers have shown different levels of effectiveness in controlling soil erosion scholl et al 2012 ricks et al 2020 and even improving several soil properties de lima et al 2019 however soil conservation is most efficient when mulching is used in conjunction with living plant species tyner et al 2011 moreover mulching practices not only should be able to protect soil from detachment ettbeb et al 2020 but should also enhance growth and survival of new plants mulching with these functions would be ideal to prevent soil erosion in delicate ecosystems mccullough and endress 2012 where the vegetal cover and plant biodiversity are scarce parhizkar et al 2020a 2020b 2020c this is the case of hydromulching a viable practice that has been very successfully used to rehabilitate degraded soil in the whole world theoretically hydromulching consists of spraying a slurry of seed water fertilizer binding agents super absorbents fiber mulch and green dye on soil surface bautista et al 2009 dodson and peterson 2009 parsakhoo et al 2018a hydromulch creates an absorbent layer by the sprayed fertilizers and grass seeds on the soil surface and has a strong influence on runoff and erosion rates holt et al 2005 babcock and mclaughlin 2013 ricks et al 2020 it is well known how a grass cover of soil reduces runoff and soil loss li et al 2011 trapping sediments transported by the surface runoff as a mechanical barrier parsakhoo et al 2018b moreover a root mat is formed by grasses in hydromulched soil fox et al 2010 and these roots greatly reduced soil detachment capacity wang et al 2018a 2018b parhizkar et al 2020a 2020b 2020c the application of hydromulch on soil surface is therefore effective for soil conservation ricks et al 2020 parsakhoo et al 2018a and beneficial for vegetation recovery lucas borja et al 2020 several studies have reported how and by what extent hydromulching can effectively reduce water runoff and soil erosion prats et al 2013 ricks et al 2020 ettbeb et al 2020 for instance eck et al 2010 showed that hydromulching reduced the sediment yield by about 75 in comparison with bare plots at a quarry in parker county usa parsakhoo et al 2018a applied hydromulch and several herbal seeds to artificial soil slopes of forest roads in iran showing significant reduction by at least 50 in soil erosion rates compared to non mulched plots according to mclaughlin and brown 2006 hydromulching based on addition of polyacrylamide reduces water turbidity and soil loss by about 85 in comparison to bare soil despite the abundant literature about the effects of hydromulching on soil erosion the studies focusing its effectiveness in controlling rill erosion when applied in deforested areas are lack rill erosion due to overland flow is the most important erosive process on steep slopes owoputi and stolte 1995 wang et al 2014b and its control is essential after deforestation moreover information regarding the effects of hydromulch roots on rill detachment capacity and erodibility is scarce to fill this gap this study evaluates the changes in rill detachment capacity due to hydromulching in deforested hillslopes more specifically the rill detachment capacity of soils subjected to hydromulching or left bare was measured in a laboratory flume at different water discharges and bed slopes moreover the root characteristics of the hydromulch that mostly influence rill detachment capacity were analyzed moreover regression models are suggested to predict rill erodibility from soil detachment capacity on both hydromulched and bare soils the quantitative data and prediction models obtained in this study can provide insights about the effectiveness of hydromulching in deforested lands where the need for soil conservation is mandatory 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was carried out on soil samples collected in a forestland of guilan province northern iran

reported in parhizkar et al 2020c 2 2 soil sampling and plot preparation samples of deforested soils were randomly collected from the top layer 0 to 20 cm between june and september 2019 according to the procedure by geng et al 2017 litter weeds and rocks were removed from soil before sampling then the samples were collected and transported to the soil testing laboratory of the college of agriculture guilan university iran here the soil was air dried and sieved through a 2 mm mesh the sampled soil was placed in two experimental plots made of timber planks length of 1 3 m and width of 0 5 m with 0 1 m high sides shoemaker 2009 singh sidhu 2015 ricks et al 2020 the soil of the first plot was subjected to hydromulch spraying on the surface fig 2 a while the first plot was left bare and assumed as control this allows the comparison between deforested and hydromulched or bare soils then the soil was wetted until saturation and maintained under a tarpaulin cover for 24 h geng et al 2017 2 3 hydromulch characteristics and application methods hydromulch material was produced using a mixture of water grass seed organic binder starter fertilizer cellulose fiber bio humus super absorbent and green dye these native materials were blended in the mixture according to the hydromulching international protocol sheldon and bradshaw 1997 albaladejo montoro et al 2000 fox et al 2010 parsakhoo et al 2018a seeds of zoysia grass which is a grass growing in the warm season and has a deep root system beiraghdar et al 2014 were selected for this study the hard leaves and deep roots of this grass make a dense vegetal cover on the soil surface soroush et al 2008 organic materials were added to the hydromulch as binding agents of soil particles in order to stabilize the soil aggregates sheldon and bradshaw 1997 parsakhoo et al 2018a to enhance the germination rapidity of the grass seeds cellulose fiber and bio humus as absorbent mats were also used holt et al 2005 dodson and peterson 2009 babcock and mclaughlin 2013 finally starter fertilizer and super absorbent were added to provide food for the growing seedlings and increase the water holding capacity of soil respectively parsakhoo et al 2018b abdallah 2019 according to the doses used in previous works properly scaled to consider the size of the plots holt et al 2005 ricks et al 2020 the hydromulch was applied at 410 kg ha 1 in 4 l water 2 4 soil sampling in hydromulched plots and characterisation of hydromulch roots once grass grew in the hydromulched plots fig 2b its leaves were removed from the soil surface using scissors then the soil samples were extracted along with their roots using a steel ring diameter of 0 1 m and height of 0 05 m parhizkar et al 2020a 2020b 2020c khanal and fox 2017 an additional hydromulched plot with the same characteristics as above was used to measure the grass root characteristics the roots were sampled from different parts of this plot after six months from planting and twenty samples were achieved see section 2 7 the diameter length biomass and weight density of grass roots were measured the length and diameter were determined using a universal tape meter and a vernier caliper respectively to measure the root biomass the samples were first oven dried at 60 c for 48 h then the dried samples were weighted for several times until a constant value root weight density was measured by the washing method over a 1 mm sieve and subsequent oven drying at 65 c for 24 h 2 5 simulation of rill detachment by overland flow rill detachment was simulated on samples collected in both plots deforested and hydromulched as well as deforested and bare soils using a hydraulic flume length of 3 5 m with a rectangular cross section width of 0 2 m fig 2c the soil was collected from each plot using a steel ring with diameter of 0 1 m and height of 0 05 m then the sample surface was sprayed with water and then inserted in the flume bed after excavating a hole of the same size as the ring about 0 5 m upstream of its outlet then the bed slope of the flume was adjusted at the desired value and the water discharge was set see section 2 7 dosing water into the flume from an upstream tap the water discharge was measured in five replications using a graduated cylinder moreover the surface water velocity was determined measured in ten replications using the fluorescent dye technique the average value was the product of the measured water velocity by coefficients of 0 6 0 7 or 0 8 for laminar transitional or turbulent flow respectively abrahams et al 1985 a level probe accuracy of 1 mm was used to measure the water depth this measurement was carried out in six replications in two cross sections 0 4 m and 1 m from the flume outlet and three points per section in the center as well as at 0 01 m from the left and right sides of the flume each experiment was stopped when the depth of the eroded soil in the steel ring was 0 015 m or after five minutes after each experiment the soil dry weight was determined oven drying the wet soil sample for 24 h at 105 c more details about the flume characteristics and the experimental procedure can be found in parhizkar et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2 6 measurement of rill detachment capacity and erodibility the mean rill detachment capacity dc kg s 1 m 2 was calculated by averaging the individual values of the replicated experiments for each water discharge and bed slope of the flume using equation 1 1 d c δ m a δ t in eq 1 δm is the dry weight of detached soil kg a is the area of the soil sample m2 and δt is experiment duration s rill erodibility kr s m 1 and critical shear stress τc pa are important parameters used as input in process based erosion models wang et al 2016 such as the water erosion prediction project wepp nearing et al 1989 both parameters are indicators of soil resistance to rill erosion in this study rill erodibility and critical shear stress were calculated from the regression equation 2 that interpolates shear stress τ pa foster 1982 and rill detachment capacity 2 d c k r τ τ c kr and τc are the slope and intercept of eq 2 shear stress was calculated in accordance with equation 3 proposed by several authors nearing et al 1997 3 τ ρ g r s in this equation r is the hydraulic radius m ρ is the water density kg m 3 g is the gravity acceleration m s 2 and s is the bed slope m m 1 parhizkar et al 2020a the hydraulic radius is calculated by equation 4 4 r h p 2 p h where h is the depth and p is the width of the water flow in m table 1 sd shows the values of h r and τ of the experiments simulating the rill detachment process at each water discharge and bed slope in the flume 2 7 experimental design an experiment of rill detachment was simulated for each soil condition deforested and bare soil hereinafter db and deforested and hydromulched soil dh at five water discharges 0 26 0 35 0 45 0 56 and 0 67 l m 1 s 1 and four bed slopes 10 15 20 and 25 the latter values are similar to the slopes of the forests of the experimental area between 7 and 8 and 20 22 or slightly more each experiment consisted of five replicates overall 200 soil samples 2 condition 5 water discharges 4 bed slopes 5 replications were subjected to rill detachment simulation data of hydromulch root characterization were coupled to data of flume experiment as follows the 100 soil samples for flume experiment one for each of five water discharges and four bed slopes each in five replications were collected from the first hydromulched plot as many samples were collected from the second hydromulched plot for root characterization choosing the same positions as the previous samples all pairs of samples were marked for identification twenty composite samples of soil collected in the second plot were achieved by mixing the five samples for each water discharge and bed slope 2 8 statistical analysis a paired sample t test evaluated the statistical significance of the differences in the rill detachment capacity dependent variable between soil conditions independent variables at p level 0 05 the normality of sample distribution was checked using qq plots when the assumptions of the statistical tests were not satisfied the data were square root transformed pearson s matrix was calculated to identify possible correlations among dc and the root characteristics of hydromulch all statistical analyses were carried out using xlstat 9 0 software addinsoft paris france 3 results 3 1 characteristics of hydromulch roots the soil samples contained hydromulch roots with a diameter between 0 61 and 0 79 mm with an average value of 0 69 0 06 mm table 1 the root length was in the range 12 6 22 5 cm while its mean was equal to 17 3 cm the mean root biomass was 22 29 3 08 g while the lowest and highest values were 17 12 and 27 73 g the root weight density was between 0 31 and 0 76 kg m 3 its mean value was 0 54 0 12 kg m 3 table 1 3 2 variations of rill detachment capacity between soil conditions the rill detachment capacity in dh soils was significantly p 0 05 lower compared to the db plot as shown in fig 3 dc was on the average 0 027 kg m 2 s 1 in dh plots a 1 5 fold value compared the db soils 0 047 kg m 2 s 1 also the variability of dc was lower in dh soils as shown by the lower standard deviation 0 013 kg m 2 s 1 vs 0 024 kg m 2 s 1 measured in the db plot fig 3 3 3 analysis of the relationships between rill detachment capacity and root characteristics the pearson s matrix shows that dc was positively correlated with root diameter r 0 593 p 0 05 and negatively correlated with root weight density r 0 566 p 0 05 a negative correlation but not significant p 0 05 was also found between diameter and weight density of hydromulch roots r 0 529 table 2 3 4 relationships between rill detachment capacity and shear stress and estimation of rill erodibility the regression analysis applied to dc and τ using equation 2 showed that the slope kr and intercept τc of the interpolating lines were different between dh and db soils the coefficient of determination r2 of the regression models was over 0 90 0 93 and 0 92 for db and dh soil respectively and always significant at p 0 05 fig 4 kr was higher in db soil 0 0078 s m 1 compared to dh plot 0 043 s m 1 while τc was higher in dh soils 4 11 pa and lower in db plots 3 91 pa fig 4 4 discussions 4 1 influence of hydromulching on rill detachment capacity in this study the deforested soils subjected to hydromulching or left bare had the same characteristics such as the soil type and texture and experienced the same water discharges and bed slopes in the experiments therefore the effects of hydromulching and especially the root characteristics can explain alone the changes in rill detachment capacity and erodibility between the treatment and the control plots previous studies have demonstrated that the conservation techniques based on hydromulching are able to significantly reduce soil loss in several environmental conditions e g hubbert et al 2012 prats et al 2013 parsakhoo et al 2018a ricks et al 2020 the results of the experiments carried out in the current investigation are in accordance to these studies as a matter of fact hydromulching reduced on the average rill detachment capacity by 44 compared to the bare soil with a peak of 54 for the minimum values of rill detachment capacity this reduction let us think that also soil loss although not directly measured in these experiments can be lower in hydromulched soils compared to bare soil this reduction may be expected since robichaud et al 2000 reported that hydromulching is able to control erosion in the short term because its application enhances a vegetation cover with a dense root system conversely other studies have demonstrated that the vegetal cover might be insignificant for the prevention and control of rill erosion de baets et al 2007 wang et al 2014a the correlation analysis helps to explain which characteristics of the hydromulch roots play a greater influence on the observed reduction in rill detachment capacity this statistical technique has identified significant correlations between rill detachment capacity on one side and weight density and diameter of roots on the other side more specifically when root weight density decreases rill detachment capacity increases root weight density is an important indicator of the ability of plants at reducing soil detachment yoshinori et al 2016 parhizkar et al 2021 conversely in soils with higher root diameter rill detachment capacity is higher also other studies have found positive correlations between some parameters related to soil resistance to concentrated erosion and root characteristics e g li et al 1992 wang et al 2015 wang and zhang 2017 the reduction in rill detachment capacity measured in deforested and hydromulched soils may be ascribed to two factors that is weight density and diameter of roots in vegetation cover first it is well known that soils with a prominent vegetation cover show higher root weight density parhizkar et al 2020c in press this parameter identified by the correlation analysis among the root characteristics that mostly influence rill detachment capacity determines a beneficial effect reducing soil detachability li et al 2015 and thus on soil s resistance to particle detachment the direct association between rill detachment capacity and root weight density is in accordance with findings of many authors e g zhang et al 2013 li et al 2015 wang et al 2015 these studies state that increases in root weight density are effective in reducing the soil detachability among the other studies reporting similar impacts of the plant roots in reducing soil detachment e g li et al 1991 li 1995 and specifically in controlling rill erosion gyssels et al 2005 it is interesting to notice that zhang et al 2013 reported an exponential decrease in soil detachment capacity with the increase in root weight density however this law has not been confirmed in our study which found a coefficient of determination of only 0 20 in regressing rill detachment capacity with root weight density data not shown second the root diameter is the other characteristic of root hydromulch that mostly influences rill detachment capacity in the hydromulched soil root diameter was lower than one mm in all experiments and this size was effective in reducing rill detachment capacity compared to the bare soil without grass roots this size is in accordance with findings of many authors e g de baets et al 2006 2007 loades et al 2010 leung et al 2015 li et al 2015 who reported that roots with diameter less than one mm are effective in controlling concentrated flow and protecting soil from rill detachment with clear reduction in hillslope erodibility conversely khanal and fox 2017 showed that erosion rates at high shear stress decrease with increasing root diameter unexpectedly the influence of the other root characteristics length and biomass on rill detachment capacity was not evidenced by this study the scarce influence of root length on soil erodibility may be justified by the fact that the detachment of soil particles is a surface process whereas grass roots mainly penetrate in the sub surface layer of soil rather than extending on its surface yoshinori et al 2016 the absence of biomass effects on soil detachability can be explained by the low time elapsed from the hydromulch application to the experiment organic matter supplied by biomass needs more time to degrade and play beneficial effects on soil structure such as aggregation properties lucas borja et al 2018 the role of these factors can be instead expected in other land uses different from deforested areas for example parhizkar et al 2020a reported that vegetation cover with the effects of its roots can help to reduce soil detachment in forestland and woodland of northern iran 4 2 influence of hydromulching on rill erodibility literature studies have clearlydemonstrated that rill detachment rate and erodibility depend on plant root characteristics mamo and bubenzer 2001a 2001b de baets and poesen 2010 gyssels et al 2006 as shown for rill detachment capacity this study has demonstrated that grass roots are able to decrease rill erodibility in hydromulched soils for bare soil rill erodibility was 1 8 times greater than the value of the hydromulched plot while the ratio of τc measured in db and dh soils was close to one this result is consistent with the studies by mamo and bubenzer 2001a mamo and bubenzer 2001b who found that rill erodibility decreases by an exponential law in soils with living plant root moreover li et al 1991 showed that the decrease in rill detachment capacity and erodibility of soil under concentrated flow is more pronounced if roots have a diameter lower than one mm as in this study and this root size is known as effective root diameter the regression model between rill detachment capacity and shear stress proposed in this study is very accurate for both bare and hydromulched soils r2 0 90 this is accuracy is in close accordance with zhang et al 2008 who found coefficients of determination up to 0 90 for equations interpolating rill detachment capacity and shear stress under different land uses it is interesting to note that the erodibility estimated for the hydromulched plot is lower compared to the values measured in grasslands in a previous work parhizkar et al 2020a this can be explained by the disturbance effects on the deforested soils on which rill erodibility was estimated in the current experiments this result is consistent with the findings of zhang et al 2003 who demonstrated that disturbed soils can be more easily detached under overland flow due to the destruction of soil structure the values of rill erodibility and critical shear stress suggested by the present study are useful to help land managers to simulate the hydrological impacts of soil conservation measures such as hydromulch application in deforested areas in order to reduce the erosion risk as a matter of fact rill erodibility and critical shear stress are the most important parameters reflecting the soil resistance to rill erosion nearing et al 1989 therefore accurate values for these parameters are essential to achieve reliable predictions of erosion by applying physically based erosion models wang et al 2016 such as the water erosion prediction project wepp laflen et al 1991 5 conclusions this study has evaluated rill detachment capacity in hydromulched and untreated plots through flume experiments on soils sampled in deforested hillslopes of northern iran rill detachment capacity in the hydromulched soil was significantly lower compared to the bare plot dc was positively and negatively correlated with diameter and density of hydromulch roots respectively rill erodibility was noticeably lower 81 in the hydromulched soil compared to the bare plot these outcomes show the effectiveness of hydromulch roots with lower diameter and higher weight density in reduceing rill detachment capacity moreover by regressing rill detachment capacity on shear stress upon the measurements rill erodibility and critical shear stress for deforested hillslopes treated with hydromulching or left bare were given these regression models and values help hydrologists in applications of erosion models to reduce erosion rates in deforested hillslopes funding faculty of

4537,terrestrial evaporation is the central link of land surface energy balance which is very important for climate change water cycle research and drought monitoring potential evapotranspiration etp is an important form of et which play a significance for calculating standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei this paper proposed a novel method of retrieving etp using precipitable water vapor pwv and temperature to obtain the high precision and resolution etp dataset and the etp and spei are obtained with the temporal spatial resolutions of monthly and 0 125 0 125 respectively in china the pwv derived from the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf is first validated and calibrated using the global navigation satellite system gnss technique etp and spei at specific stations are then calculated using the site based revised thornthwaith s rth model with high precision finally spherical harmonic function is applied to fit the coefficients of the s rth model in china and a rth model over china c rth with high spatial resolution 0 125 0 125 is established statistical result reveals that 1 the average root mean square rms and mean absolute error mae of the calibrated ecmwf derived pwv have been improved from 2 0 1 7 mm to 1 7 1 4 mm respectively using the gnss derived pwv 2 the improvement rate of etp derived from the s rth model is approximately 68 compared with that from the th model and the average rms and mae of the etp difference between s rth and penman monteith pm are 10 7 mm and 8 5 mm respectively 3 the average rms and mae of potential difference between c rth and pm are 17 6 mm and 13 7 mm respectively although the accuracy of the c rth model is slightly lower than that of the s rth model it is significantly improved compared with the th model and the calculated etp data have been converted from point to surface the proposed method expands the application of gnss technique to obtain etp data set which provides the basic data guarantee for drought disaster prevention and control in china keywords precipitable water vapor temperature evapotranspiration c rth model 1 introduction evapotranspiration is an important parameter for characterizing water cycle the hydrological cycle in the world is also accelerated with the continuous warming of global climate shukla and mintz 1982 vicente serrano et al 2014 ye et al 2014 which has a serious impact on environmental change and agricultural production in addition potential et etp is also a vital parameter for calculating standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 and the precision and spatial resolution of etp values determine that of spei in recent years extreme disasters especially drought disasters occur frequently and cause serious damage to the natural ecological environment and increase the risk of forest fire significantly marín et al 2018 the fifth assessment report ar5 of the intergovernmental panel on climate change emphasized that global warming has intensified the occurrence of drought disasters and the global climate will warm further and worsen future drought situations stocker et al 2013 therefore obtaining an accurate etp is not only helpful for understanding water cycle change but also in improving the monitoring accuracy of drought index previous studies have been performed to calculate etp using different methods or techniques valipour 2015 such as mass transfer method valipour 2015 radiation method alexandris et al 2008 temperature method ai and yang 2016 lysimeter hargreaves 1989 allen et al 2011 and remote sensing tecnology allen et al 2007 fisher et al 2020 javadian et al 2020 the lysimeter can measure high precision etp data but with a high cost thereby limiting its wide application allen et al 2011 valipour 2015 penman and thornthwaith proposed the concept of evaporation power penman 1948 thornthwaite 1948 monteith 1965 introduced the concept of canopy resistance in the study of etp of underlying surface and proposed the famous penman monteith pm formula monteith 1965 satellite remote sensing provides a new technique for estimating surface etp remote sensing technique can calculate regional daily etp with high spatial resolution sun and ren 2013 yuan et al 2013 but with relatively poor accuracy mo et al 2017 thornthwaite method can calculate the etp by only using temperature and latitude however such method ignores the aerodynamic and radiation terms and the value cannot be calculated for the area with monthly average temperature less than 0 c during winter zhao et al 2019a 2019b the etp calculated using the pm model has been recommended by the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations the american society of civil engineers found that the reference crop water requirement calculated by the pm model was very close to the measured value in arid and humid regions by using lysimeter data measured under 11 different climatic conditions around the world allen et al 1998 therefore pm derived etp has high precision and often regarded as a reference to verify the etp values calculated from other methods lang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 however many meteorological parameters are required when calculating the etp by using the pm formula in some areas the meteorological parameters are difficult to obtain thereby leading to the unattainability of etp values therefore the spatial resolution of the pm derived etp is relatively low gavilán et al 2006 ngongondo et al 2013 on the other aspect high spatial resolution etp is important for the quantitative monitoring and accurate early warning of meteorological disasters therefore retrieving etp with high spatial resolution and accuracy is crucial for the study of meteorological natural disasters atmospheric precipitable water vapor pwv is the main driving force for the occurrence and development of meteorological disasters it is also the key link of the global water cycle koulali et al 2012 pwv can be obtained by using methods such as radiosonde remote sensing radar and global navigation satellite system gnss technology turner et al 2003 zhao et al 2019a 2019b with the continuous development of earth observation technology gnss can be used to detect soil moisture rodriguez alvarez et al 2009 ocean tide semmling et al 2011 wind speed clarizia et al 2014 vegetation water content camps et al 2016 extreme weather warning zhao et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d and enso monitoring zhao et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d meanwhile the pwv can be easily obtained with high precision low cost and all weather conditions by using the gnss technique zhang et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 apart from the aforementioned applications of gnss derived pwv bordi et al 2016 found that the precipitation conversion rate based on pwv and precipitation was highly correlated with the standardized precipitation index spi bordi et al 2016 zhao et al 2020a zhao et al 2020b zhao et al 2020c zhao et al 2020d developed a new drought monitoring index using the pwv and precipitation to monitor global drought which is called the standardized precipitation conversion index zhao et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d vicente serrano et al 2010 stated that drought was closely related to etp therefore the aforementioned studies verified that pwv has the potential in calculating etp in addition the correlation coefficients between pwv and etp can reach to 0 73 in our previous study zhao et al 2019a 2019b therefore a revised thornthwaith rth model is proposed using pwv and temperature over the lp area however the accuracy of the rth model is relatively poor at specific gnss stations because only one set of model coefficient is used for the entire lp area in addition the applicability of the proposed model to the other areas was unverified to improve the accuracy and spatial resolution of etp value a novel etp model over china c rth has been proposed in this model the etp and spei values at 826 meteorological stations in china are first calculated using the site based rth s rth model with high precision subsequently the spherical harmonic function shf is applied to fit the coefficients of the s rth model in china and a rth model over china c rth with high spatial resolution is established the pwv and temperature derived from the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf have been used to verify the proposed model in addition the grid based etp and spei products with the spatial resolution of 0 125 0 125 have been generated in china over the period of 1979 2018 experimental result reveals the good quality of etp spei products generated from c rth model when compared with that derived from the th model although the accuracy of etp is slightly poorer compared with that from the s rth model the spatial resolution has been significantly improved from site to surface scale 2 data and methods 2 1 study area china is located in the south of the eurasian continent and in the middle latitude region of the northern hemisphere fig 1 the terrain is high in the west and low in the east and is distributed in a ladder shape mountains plateaus and hills account for approximately 67 of the land area whereas the basins and plains account for approximately 33 of the land area china has a vast territory and a wide range of latitudes in addition the climate of different regions also vary greatly from tropical to cold temperate zone the total amount of water resources in north china is less than that in south china the annual precipitation decreases from the southeast coast to the northwest inland zhou et al 2009 bothe et al 2012 the etp in spring autumn and winter is lower than that in summer and the variation of etp magnitude is very large in different areas of china therefore this area is selected to validate the applicability of the proposed c rth model 2 2 data description in this paper site based and grid based pwv temperature and precipitation are collected in china the specific information of the selected data has been given in table 1 a total of 826 meteorological stations in china have been collected from china meteorological administration cma over the period of 1946 to present this data set including daily maximum temperature daily minimum temperature daily average temperature daily average wind speed solar illumination duration and relative humidity has been checked strictly therefore the etp at these 826 meteorological stations can be calculated using the pm model in addition the gnss derived pwv data at 259 stations are also obtained from the crustal movement observation network of china cmonoc over the period of 1999 to 2015 zhang et al 2017 the zenithal total delay ztd is first obtained from the gnss observation before calculating the pwv ztd consists of zenith hydrostatic delay zhd and zenith wet delay zwd then the highly accurate zhd can be estimated using surface pressure hpa based on the saastamoinen model saastamoinen 1972 after obtaining ztd the zwd can be obtained by extracting zhd from ztd finally the pwv can be calculated using the conversion factor q huang et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 showed that the average root mean square rms of the gnss derived pwv in china is 0 75 mm fig 1 depicts the geographic distribution of gnss and meteorological stations in china in addition the grid based pwv and temperature data with the spatial temporal resolutions of monthly and 0 125 0 125 have been obtained from era interim over the period of 1979 to 2019 era interim is the fourth version of ecmwf ecmwf provides the meteorological product data with high precision and high spatial and temporal resolution which is obtained by the assimilation of multisource observation data among the ecmwf reanalysis data era interim is the most complete reanalysis data with the most data sets dee et al 2011 era interim and gnss derived pwv are in good agreement in china but the error of some sites in china is greater than 5 mm zhang et al 2019 the grid based precipitation derived from china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd with the time resolution of 0 1 0 1 has also been used to calculate the spei this data set is based on the international existing princeton reanalysis data gldas data gewex srb radiation data and trmm precipitation data as the background field the accuracy of the data set is lower than the observation data derived from the meteorological bureau of china but higher than that from the satellite remote sensing technique and international reanalysis products he et al 2020 in addition zhao et al 2019a zhao et al 2019b verified that the averaged rms of the cmfd derived precipitation is 3 82 mm when compared with the actual precipitation to better validate the performance of proposed method in this paper two independent etp and one spei products have been used which are the etp provided by mod16a2 and goal of global land data assimilation system gldas and spei provided by global spei dataset speibase respectively mod16a2 provides the global products such as et latent heat flux etp and potential latent heat flux with the spatial temporal resolutions of 8 days and 500 m respectively the gldas is to generate land surface state and flux field using advanced land surface modeling and data assimilation technology with the satellite and ground observation data products in this paper etp product provided by gldas is used with a spatial temporal resolution of 0 25 0 25 and monthly respectively in addition speibase provides long term and reliable information on global drought and the time scales of spei is from month to 48 month scales the spatial temporal resolutions of spei used in this paper is monthly and 0 5 0 5 respectively 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 etp and spei calculation in this paper the etp and spei have been calculated on the basis of the pm and th models the th model is simple and only depends on temperature and latitude as shown in formula 1 karunarathne et al 2016 however the proposed algorithm only considers the contribution of heat factor to etp and ignores the aerodynamic factor therefore the etp in china is underestimated trajkovic et al 2019 although the contribution of aerodynamic factor to etp is relatively low the influence of aerodynamic factor on etp cannot be ignored with the change in climate in four seasons pm model considers the influence of heat and aerodynamic factors allen et al 1994 therefore the calculated etp is accurate eq 2 the commonly used drought indexes include spi palmer dry severity index pdsi and spei among them spei considers precipitation and evaporation as the two most important drought influencing factors that which can reflect the change in surface water balance comprehensively this index is also a continuous event function that can reflect the duration and accumulation of drought therefore spei is an ideal index for monitoring and evaluating drought under the background of global warming this index can reflect the drought situation under the accumulated rainfall in different time scales from 1 to 24 months and it is widely used globally vicente serrano et al 2011 ma et al 2020 the detailed calculation of etp can be referred to in karunarathne et al 2016 1 et p 0 t 0 16 k 10 t i m t 0 where t is the monthly mean temperature c and i is the heat index the method for obtaining k i and m can be referred to in vicente serrano et al 2010 in addition the method for calculating etp based on the pm model is expressed as follows monteith 1965 2 e t p 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 16 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where t is 2 m average air temperature c rn is the crop surface net radiation mj m 2 d 1 g is the soil heat flux mj m 2 d 1 u2 is the 2 m wind speed m s 1 es is the saturation vapor pressure kpa ea is the actual vapor pressure kpa δis the slope of the vapor pressure curve kpa 1 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 900 is the coefficient for the reference crop and 0 34 is the wind coefficient for the reference crop after the etp is obtained the monthly climatic water balance can be obtained by extracting the etp from precipitation finally the spei at different time scales can be calculated by accumulating the monthly climatic water balance of corresponding time scales and performing the log logistic standardization the detailed information of calculating spei can be referred to vicente serrano et al 2010 2 3 2 shf to estimate etp in china with high precision and spatial resolution this value is first calculated on the basis of the s rth model at 826 meteorological stations subsequently the model coefficients at each meteorological station have been determined finally shf is introduced to fit the model coefficients over entire china using the coefficients of s rth model at 826 meteorological stations the spherical harmonic model is expressed as follows zhao et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d 3 b shf φ λ n 0 n m 0 m a nm a nm b nm b nm where φ and λ represent the latitude and longitude of station or grid point respectively n and m are the maximum degree and order of shf respectively a nm and b nm are expressed as follows 4 a nm p nm sin φ cos m λ b nm p nm sin φ sin m λ where p nm t is the legendre function which is calculated as follows 5 p nm t 1 2 n 1 t 2 m 2 k 0 n m 2 1 k 2 n 2 k k n

estimated 3 experimental results and discussion 3 1 pwv calibration derived from era interim some observations obtained by gnss are missing because the gnss receiver failure or poor observation conditions fig 2 gives an example of the long time series of gnss derived 6 hourly pwv at xinn station 36 6006 n 101 7743 e and the interpolated data over the period of 1999 2015 it can be observed that the evident annual periodicity existed in pwv and the pwv value is the highest in summer and the lowest in winter in the paper the stations with more than 30 missing data are eliminated when selecting ground based gnss observations therefore 224 stations are left statistical result shows that the averaged missing rate of 224 gnss stations is 11 31 a ssa for missing data ssam method has been introduced to estimate the missing data according to the periodicity characteristic of pwv time series wang et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 although the pwv provided by the era interim has high spatial resolution its accuracy is worse than that derived from gnss zhang et al 2019 to ensure the reliability of the experiment era interim provided pwv is first calibrated using the cmonoc derived pwv at 224 gnss stations the era interim provided pwv data are interpolated into the 224 gnss stations using the bilinear interpolation method fig 3 shows the monthly pwv differences between era interim and gnss at 224 stations over the period of 1999 to 2015 the monthly pwv differences are large at different gnss stations and varies from 12 mm to 7 mm in addition the maximum pwv difference occurred in may to september with the value ranges from 5 mm to 12 mm the main reason of the large pwv difference in summer is the occurrence of high frequency rainfall event the atmospheric water vapor changes significantly during the rainfall and the era interim provided pwv cannot be well estimated under such cases benevides et al 2015 yao et al 2017 manandhar et al 2018 zhao et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d therefore era interim derived pwv is calibrated on a monthly scale using the gnss derived pwv the pwv differences between gnss and era interim is first obtained at the 224 stations subsequently the shf is introduced to fit these differences over entire china finally the grid based pwv data provided by the era interim is calibrated using the fitted pwv difference the specific process of calibrating the era interim pwv can be referred to the figure s1 in supplementary material to verify the performance of the calibrated pwv data only 149 gnss stations 2 3 are selected to establish the spherical harmonic model and the 75 other gnss stations 1 3 are used to evaluate the calibrated result here the shf with the degree and order are both 9 to fit the pwv residual fig 4 compares the internal and external accuracy of the calibrated and un calibrated pwv data at the gnss stations over the period of 1999 2015 the internal and external accuracy of the calibrated pwv data at each gnss station have been improved to different degrees statistical result reveals that the improvement rate of the proposed method for external and internal validations are approximately 15 over entire china table 2 shows the statistical result of the averaged rms and mean absolute error mae for the internal and external validations before and after calibration respectively the averaged rms and mae of the calibrated pwv have been improved to different degrees when compared with that from the uncalibrated conditions 3 2 establishment of s rth model 3 2 1 comparison of etp derived from different models the etp calculated using pm and th models at 826 meteorological stations is first compared over the period of 1979 to 2018 and fig 5 presents the averaged etp distribution of the meteorological stations derived from th and pm models as well as their difference etp is higher in the south and lower in the north of china and is gradually decreasing from south to north in addition the spatial distribution of etp derived from pm and th models varies especially in the western and northern china the etp difference in fig 5 c reveals that the regional difference of etp is very evident and the deviation value is between 80 mm and 20 mm th derived etp is underestimated in most areas of china especially in the northwestand central china in southeast china the th derived etp is overestimated which is consistent with the conclusions of previous studies van der schrier et al 2011 chen and sun 2015 this may be mainly caused by temperature the temperature in southeast china is higher than that in northwest china which leads to the etp difference between th and pm models in different regions van der schrier et al 2011 to improve the accuracy of the tm derived etp the etp difference between the pm and th models is obtained and analyzed using pwv temperature fig 6 shows the distribution of correlation coefficients between etp difference and pwv temperature over the period of 1979 to 2018 the correlation coefficients between etp difference and pwv temperature are 0 73 and 0 58 over the whole china in addition the correlation between etp difference and pwv temperature presents the same spatial distribution that is the southeast region has strong negative correlation whereas an opposite correlation existed in the northwest area the different correlation existed in china is mainly due to the over and under estimated etp by the th model as mentioned before that a strong linear relationship existed between etp difference and pwv temperature therefore a s rth model is proposed using the multilinear model as follows 7 s r t h etp t h etp f p w v t where s r t h etp and t h etp are the etp value estimated by the s rth and th models respectively f p w v t is the etp difference between pm and th model which can be expressed as 8 f p w v t b 0 b 1 p w v b 2 t where b 0 b 1 b 2 are the model coefficients to be estimated 3 2 2 validation of the s rth model th and s rth derived etp have been calculated and compared with the corresponding pm derived etp at 826 meteorological stations to evaluate the performance of the proposed s rth model the correlation of pm derived etp is first compared with that from th and s rth models over the period of 1979 2018 see fig 7 it can be observed that a higher correlation existed between pm and s rth derived etp in addition the long time series of etp derived from pm th and s rth models have been given in figure s2 see the supplementary material it found that s rth derived etp has a good consistency with that from pm model statistical result reveals the coefficients between th s rth and pm models are 0 91 and 0 96 respectively to quantitative evaluate the accuracy of proposed s rth model fig 8 presents the averaged rms and mae of etp difference between th s rth and pm model over the period of 1979 2018 the rms and mae of s rth is evidently lower than that from th especially for the west of china statistical result reveals that the averaged mae and rms of s rth model are 10 7 and 8 5 mm respectively whereas the values derived from the th model is 33 5 mm and 28 9 mm respectively therefore the s rth derived etp has been significantly improved compared with that from th model to describe the performance of the s rth model quantitatively an index called improvement rate is proposed and expressed as 9 irate r m s s r t h r m s th rm s th where irate is the improvement rate and rm s s r t h and rm s th are the rms values of the s rth and th models respectively fig 9 presents the improvement rate of s rth model at each meteorological station over the period of 1979 2018 the improvement rate at each station varies the corresponding value ranges from 35 to 85 and the averaged improvement rate over entire china is 68 the aforementioned results reveal that the proposed s rth model show a significant improvement when compared with the th model in addition only pwv and temperature are used to establish the model which greatly overcomes the problem that a lot of meteorological parameters are required when calculating the pm derived etp it can be concluded that the quality of th derived etp can be improved significantly only using the temperature and pwv which is mainly due to that 1 temperature is the main factor affecting the etp thornthwaite 1948 muniandy et al 2016 2 and pwv has a closely relationship with the surface evapotranspiration and vegetation zhao et al 2019a 2019b however the limitation of s rth model is also evident although the etp value can be calculated on the basis of s rth model at meteorological stations the values at other areas without meteorological data cannot be calculated thereby becoming the key issue required to be resolved 3 3 c rth model a novel rth model which is called china rth c rth model is proposed to obtain the etp values with high accuracy and spatial resolution this model can obtain etp with the spatial resolution of 0 125 0 125 on the premise of ensuring the accuracy of etp as mentioned in section 3 2 only the coefficients of b0 b1 and b2 of s rth model at 826 meteorological stations are obtained therefore the shf is applied to fit the corresponding coefficients of b0 b1 and b2 over the whole china respectively finally the grid based etp can be calculated using the fitted coefficients and pwv temperature at each grid point therefore the etp products with the same spatial resolution is generated in china because the spatial resolution of pwv and temperature provided by era interim is 0 125 the performance of the established coefficient model using the shf is first analyzed only the coefficients of b0 b1 and b2 of 549 2 3 stations are used to establish the model whereas the corresponding coefficients at 277 other 1 3 stations are selected as the external validation some experiments have been performed to determine the optimized degree and order of shf statistical result reveals that the smallest rms and mae can be obtained for b0 b1 and b2 whereas the values of 14 15 and 13 are selected for degree and order of shf fig 10 shows the scatter density diagram of the model coefficients of b0 b1 and b2 between shf and s rth under the cases of internal and external validations over entire china a good correlation existed between the shf and s rth derived coefficients of b0 b1 and b2 statistical result reveals that the correlation coefficients are 0 93 0 94 and 0 93 for b0 b1 and b2 between shf and s rth respectively such result verifies that the coefficients b0 b1 and b2 have been well fitted by the shf in china and can be used for calculating the etp value at grid point to further validate the performance of the fitted coefficients above the etp is calculated at 549 and 277selected meteorological stations using the established and fitted coefficients of shf respectively fig 11 presents the distributions of rms and mae of etp difference between c rth and pm models over the period of 1979 to 2018 for the cases of internal and external validations the etp derived from c rth model has a good performance at the selected meteorological stations in both cases most rms values range from 0 to 30 mm whereas the mae values range from 0 mm to 15 mm statistical result reveals that the rms and mae for the internal and external comparisons over the whole china are 13 1 10 6 mm and 12 8 10 3 mm respectively such comparison result reveals the good stability of the fitted coefficients and the fitted coefficients obtained by shf can be used to calculate etp value over the whole china 3 4 validation of etp derived from c rth model to further evaluate the performance of c rth model in the whole china the grid based etp values at one month scale with the spatial resolution of 0 125 0 125 are calculated over the period of 1979 2018 the site based etp at meteorological stations is also calculated on the basis of the pm and s rth models in addition the grid based etp is calculated using th model with the same spatial resolution as c rth model fig 12 presents the spatial distributions of the averaged etp derived from pm th sth and c rth models over the period of 1979 2018 the spatial distribution of c rth derived etp is similar to that from pm and s rth models in addition the etp distribution derived from th model is not consistent with those from the three other models the etp values at the meteorological stations are obtained by using the interpolated method using the grid based etp derived from c rth model and compared with that from the pm model in addition the independent etp products derived from mod16a2 and gldas are also used to further validate the proposed c rth model fig 13 gives the scatter plot of pm derived etp with that derived from th s rth c rth glads models and mod16a2 respectively it can be found that the etp derived from s rth and c rth models has a good consistency with that from pm model the th derived etp is underestimated while the modis and gldas derived etp is overestimated and this result is similar with the previous studies bai and liu 2018 degano et al 2020 duhan et al 2020 wen et al 2020 table 3 gives the statistical result of averaged rms mae and bias of etp difference between pm and th s rth c rth modis gldas model over the period of 2000 2018 it can be concluded that the averaged rms mae and bias of th modis gldas are larger than that from c rth and s rth models the averaged rms mae of etp difference between c rth and pm models are 17 6 and 13 7 mm respectively while the corresponding values between pm and s rth model are 10 7 and 8 5 mm respectively therefore the accuracy of s rth is the highest followed by c rth model th model and modis gldas is the worst although the quality of c rth model is slightly poorer than that of the s rth model the c rth model overcomes the disadvantages of low spatial resolution of s rth the etp values at the arbitrary location can be calculated on the basis of the c rth model under the cases of guaranteeing the accuracy of the etp values in addition although the spatial resolution of c rth model is lower than that of modis the accuracy of c rth derived etp is superior to that of modis therefore the c rth model can make up for the shortcomings of low spatial resolution and poor accuracy effectively which is of great significance for water cycle research and high spatial resolution drought index calculation 3 5 validation of spei derived from c rth model an important application of retrieving etp is to calculate the drought monitoring index therefore the spei with the spatial resolution of 0 125 0 125 is calculated on the basis of the c rth derived etp over the period of 1979 2018 the monthly precipitation data derived from cmfd is first preprocessed to unify the spatial resolution with that of ecmwf subsequently the spei can be calculated at different time scales vicente serrano et al 2010 the spei values at specific meteorological stations are also calculated on the basis of the pm model using the pwv and precipitation derived from cma at 1 to 24 month time scales in addition the grid based spei values derived from c rth model can also be interpolated into the meteorological stations using the bilinear interpolation method fig 14 shows the distribution of the site based averaged spei derived from pm model and grid based averaged spei derived from c rth model at 1 3 6 and 12 month scales over the period of 1979 2018 the spatial distribution of spei derived from pm and c rth models under different time scales are similar over the entire china areas with values greater and less than 0 indicate that the area is moist and drought respectively in addition the greater the absolute value of the spei is the more serious the humidity or drought will be according to the drought grade classification of spei provided by vicente serrano et al 2010 table 4 the first and second columns in fig 12 show a pattern of flooding in the south and drought in the north under the monthly 1 month scale seasonal 3 month scale and semi annual 6 month scale time scales which is consistent with the law of drought and flood distribution in china huijun 2002 ding et al 2009 spei with 12 month scale spei 12 mainly represents the hydrological drought paulo et al 2012 yao et al 2018 which is also derived from pm and c rth models in fig 12 j k spei 12 derived from pm and c rth models are relatively small and without obvious deviation thereby also indicating the capability of c rth model for hydrological drought in china to evaluate the c rth derived spei better the spei deviations between pm and c rth models have been calculated at 826 meteorological stations at the third column of fig 12 the spei deviation mainly concentrated in 0 5 to 0 5 at different time scales statistical result shows that the averaged bias of spei deviation at china are 0 11 0 07 0 22 and 0 002 for cases of 1 3 6 and 12 month scales respectively the aforementioned result verifies that c rth derived spei has a similar capacity with the pm derived spei for monitoring the drought wet at china under different time scales however c rth derived spei has an advantage of high spatial resolution which can also be used for monitoring drought for areas with some unavailable meteorological data to embody the advantage of calculated spei using the c rth model the comparison of spei product have been performed derived from pm c rth model and speibase fig 15 presents the distributions of correlation coefficients at each station between pm derived and c rth speibase derived spei over the period of 1979 2018 at 1 3 6 and 12 month scales it can be observed that the coefficient between speibase and pm model is low especially at 1 3 and 6 time scale in addition the coefficients between pm and c rth speibase derived spei have been given over the whole china see s3 in the supplementary material and the similar result is obtained as that in the comparison of fig 15 in addition the above result is consistent with that in wang et al 2019 the main reason is that the spebase derived spei is calculated using the global analyzed analysis cru ts3 2 which has an evident bias especially in the mountains shi et al 2017 4 conclusion in this paper a revised th model in china c rth has been proposed to overcome the disadvantages of low spatial resolution of pm model and low precision of th model the s rth model is first established to obtain the high precision etp values however such model can only obtain the etp values at specific meteorological stations to improve the spatial resolution of s rth model shf has been applied to fit coefficients b0 b1 and b2 of the s rth model derived from meteorological stations and then the model coefficients of the arbitrary location can be obtained in china therefore the grid based rth model in china c rth is established to calculate the etp with the spatial resolution of 0 125 0 125 using the fitted coefficients and ecmwf derived pwv and temperature finally the grid based spei is also obtained using the c rth derived etp and cmfd derived precipitation at china over the period of 1979 2018 site based and grid based meteorological data are selected to perform the experiment ecmwf derived pwv is first calibrated by the gnss derived pwv to guarantee the accuracy of grid based pwv data the etp derived from th s rth and c rth models have been compared with that from the pm model at the 826 meteorological stations statistical result shows that the s rth model has the best performance followed by c rth model although the quality of c rth model is slightly poorer than that of the s rth model c rth model solve the problem of low spatial resolution of traditional models effectively in addition the accuracy of the c rth model is significantly improved when compared with the th model finally the spei derived from c rth model is also compared with that from the pm model validated result verifies the capacity of c rth derived spei for drought wet monitoring in china at different time scales based on the good performance of c rth model for retrieving etp and spei at china we plan to release the first version of grid based etp and spei products in china c rth ver 1 0 such dataset includes the monthly etp and spei at grid points with the spatial resolution of 0 125 0 125 in china over the period of 1979 to 2018 we hope that such dataset is beneficial to scientific research and drought monitoring application some or all data models or

4537,terrestrial evaporation is the central link of land surface energy balance which is very important for climate change water cycle research and drought monitoring potential evapotranspiration etp is an important form of et which play a significance for calculating standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei this paper proposed a novel method of retrieving etp using precipitable water vapor pwv and temperature to obtain the high precision and resolution etp dataset and the etp and spei are obtained with the temporal spatial resolutions of monthly and 0 125 0 125 respectively in china the pwv derived from the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf is first validated and calibrated using the global navigation satellite system gnss technique etp and spei at specific stations are then calculated using the site based revised thornthwaith s rth model with high precision finally spherical harmonic function is applied to fit the coefficients of the s rth model in china and a rth model over china c rth with high spatial resolution 0 125 0 125 is established statistical result reveals that 1 the average root mean square rms and mean absolute error mae of the calibrated ecmwf derived pwv have been improved from 2 0 1 7 mm to 1 7 1 4 mm respectively using the gnss derived pwv 2 the improvement rate of etp derived from the s rth model is approximately 68 compared with that from the th model and the average rms and mae of the etp difference between s rth and penman monteith pm are 10 7 mm and 8 5 mm respectively 3 the average rms and mae of potential difference between c rth and pm are 17 6 mm and 13 7 mm respectively although the accuracy of the c rth model is slightly lower than that of the s rth model it is significantly improved compared with the th model and the calculated etp data have been converted from point to surface the proposed method expands the application of gnss technique to obtain etp data set which provides the basic data guarantee for drought disaster prevention and control in china keywords precipitable water vapor temperature evapotranspiration c rth model 1 introduction evapotranspiration is an important parameter for characterizing water cycle the hydrological cycle in the world is also accelerated with the continuous warming of global climate shukla and mintz 1982 vicente serrano et al 2014 ye et al 2014 which has a serious impact on environmental change and agricultural production in addition potential et etp is also a vital parameter for calculating standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 and the precision and spatial resolution of etp values determine that of spei in recent years extreme disasters especially drought disasters occur frequently and cause serious damage to the natural ecological environment and increase the risk of forest fire significantly marín et al 2018 the fifth assessment report ar5 of the intergovernmental panel on climate change emphasized that global warming has intensified the occurrence of drought disasters and the global climate will warm further and worsen future drought situations stocker et al 2013 therefore obtaining an accurate etp is not only helpful for understanding water cycle change but also in improving the monitoring accuracy of drought index previous studies have been performed to calculate etp using different methods or techniques valipour 2015 such as mass transfer method valipour 2015 radiation method alexandris et al 2008 temperature method ai and yang 2016 lysimeter hargreaves 1989 allen et al 2011 and remote sensing tecnology allen et al 2007 fisher et al 2020 javadian et al 2020 the lysimeter can measure high precision etp data but with a high cost thereby limiting its wide application allen et al 2011 valipour 2015 penman and thornthwaith proposed the concept of evaporation power penman 1948 thornthwaite 1948 monteith 1965 introduced the concept of canopy resistance in the study of etp of underlying surface and proposed the famous penman monteith pm formula monteith 1965 satellite remote sensing provides a new technique for estimating surface etp remote sensing technique can calculate regional daily etp with high spatial resolution sun and ren 2013 yuan et al 2013 but with relatively poor accuracy mo et al 2017 thornthwaite method can calculate the etp by only using temperature and latitude however such method ignores the aerodynamic and radiation terms and the value cannot be calculated for the area with monthly average temperature less than 0 c during winter zhao et al 2019a 2019b the etp calculated using the pm model has been recommended by the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations the american society of civil engineers found that the reference crop water requirement calculated by the pm model was very close to the measured value in arid and humid regions by using lysimeter data measured under 11 different climatic conditions around the world allen et al 1998 therefore pm derived etp has high precision and often regarded as a reference to verify the etp values calculated from other methods lang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 however many meteorological parameters are required when calculating the etp by using the pm formula in some areas the meteorological parameters are difficult to obtain thereby leading to the unattainability of etp values therefore the spatial resolution of the pm derived etp is relatively low gavilán et al 2006 ngongondo et al 2013 on the other aspect high spatial resolution etp is important for the quantitative monitoring and accurate early warning of meteorological disasters therefore retrieving etp with high spatial resolution and accuracy is crucial for the study of meteorological natural disasters atmospheric precipitable water vapor pwv is the main driving force for the occurrence and development of meteorological disasters it is also the key link of the global water cycle koulali et al 2012 pwv can be obtained by using methods such as radiosonde remote sensing radar and global navigation satellite system gnss technology turner et al 2003 zhao et al 2019a 2019b with the continuous development of earth observation technology gnss can be used to detect soil moisture rodriguez alvarez et al 2009 ocean tide semmling et al 2011 wind speed clarizia et al 2014 vegetation water content camps et al 2016 extreme weather warning zhao et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d and enso monitoring zhao et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d meanwhile the pwv can be easily obtained with high precision low cost and all weather conditions by using the gnss technique zhang et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 apart from the aforementioned applications of gnss derived pwv bordi et al 2016 found that the precipitation conversion rate based on pwv and precipitation was highly correlated with the standardized precipitation index spi bordi et al 2016 zhao et al 2020a zhao et al 2020b zhao et al 2020c zhao et al 2020d developed a new drought monitoring index using the pwv and precipitation to monitor global drought which is called the standardized precipitation conversion index zhao et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d vicente serrano et al 2010 stated that drought was closely related to etp therefore the aforementioned studies verified that pwv has the potential in calculating etp in addition the correlation coefficients between pwv and etp can reach to 0 73 in our previous study zhao et al 2019a 2019b therefore a revised thornthwaith rth model is proposed using pwv and temperature over the lp area however the accuracy of the rth model is relatively poor at specific gnss stations because only one set of model coefficient is used for the entire lp area in addition the applicability of the proposed model to the other areas was unverified to improve the accuracy and spatial resolution of etp value a novel etp model over china c rth has been proposed in this model the etp and spei values at 826 meteorological stations in china are first calculated using the site based rth s rth model with high precision subsequently the spherical harmonic function shf is applied to fit the coefficients of the s rth model in china and a rth model over china c rth with high spatial resolution is established the pwv and temperature derived from the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf have been used to verify the proposed model in addition the grid based etp and spei products with the spatial resolution of 0 125 0 125 have been generated in china over the period of 1979 2018 experimental result reveals the good quality of etp spei products generated from c rth model when compared with that derived from the th model although the accuracy of etp is slightly poorer compared with that from the s rth model the spatial resolution has been significantly improved from site to surface scale 2 data and methods 2 1 study area china is located in the south of the eurasian continent and in the middle latitude region of the northern hemisphere fig 1 the terrain is high in the west and low in the east and is distributed in a ladder shape mountains plateaus and hills account for approximately 67 of the land area whereas the basins and plains account for approximately 33 of the land area china has a vast territory and a wide range of latitudes in addition the climate of different regions also vary greatly from tropical to cold temperate zone the total amount of water resources in north china is less than that in south china the annual precipitation decreases from the southeast coast to the northwest inland zhou et al 2009 bothe et al 2012 the etp in spring autumn and winter is lower than that in summer and the variation of etp magnitude is very large in different areas of china therefore this area is selected to validate the applicability of the proposed c rth model 2 2 data description in this paper site based and grid based pwv temperature and precipitation are collected in china the specific information of the selected data has been given in table 1 a total of 826 meteorological stations in china have been collected from china meteorological administration cma over the period of 1946 to present this data set including daily maximum temperature daily minimum temperature daily average temperature daily average wind speed solar illumination duration and relative humidity has been checked strictly therefore the etp at these 826 meteorological stations can be calculated using the pm model in addition the gnss derived pwv data at 259 stations are also obtained from the crustal movement observation network of china cmonoc over the period of 1999 to 2015 zhang et al 2017 the zenithal total delay ztd is first obtained from the gnss observation before calculating the pwv ztd consists of zenith hydrostatic delay zhd and zenith wet delay zwd then the highly accurate zhd can be estimated using surface pressure hpa based on the saastamoinen model saastamoinen 1972 after obtaining ztd the zwd can be obtained by extracting zhd from ztd finally the pwv can be calculated using the conversion factor q huang et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 showed that the average root mean square rms of the gnss derived pwv in china is 0 75 mm fig 1 depicts the geographic distribution of gnss and meteorological stations in china in addition the grid based pwv and temperature data with the spatial temporal resolutions of monthly and 0 125 0 125 have been obtained from era interim over the period of 1979 to 2019 era interim is the fourth version of ecmwf ecmwf provides the meteorological product data with high precision and high spatial and temporal resolution which is obtained by the assimilation of multisource observation data among the ecmwf reanalysis data era interim is the most complete reanalysis data with the most data sets dee et al 2011 era interim and gnss derived pwv are in good agreement in china but the error of some sites in china is greater than 5 mm zhang et al 2019 the grid based precipitation derived from china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd with the time resolution of 0 1 0 1 has also been used to calculate the spei this data set is based on the international existing princeton reanalysis data gldas data gewex srb radiation data and trmm precipitation data as the background field the accuracy of the data set is lower than the observation data derived from the meteorological bureau of china but higher than that from the satellite remote sensing technique and international reanalysis products he et al 2020 in addition zhao et al 2019a zhao et al 2019b verified that the averaged rms of the cmfd derived precipitation is 3 82 mm when compared with the actual precipitation to better validate the performance of proposed method in this paper two independent etp and one spei products have been used which are the etp provided by mod16a2 and goal of global land data assimilation system gldas and spei provided by global spei dataset speibase respectively mod16a2 provides the global products such as et latent heat flux etp and potential latent heat flux with the spatial temporal resolutions of 8 days and 500 m respectively the gldas is to generate land surface state and flux field using advanced land surface modeling and data assimilation technology with the satellite and ground observation data products in this paper etp product provided by gldas is used with a spatial temporal resolution of 0 25 0 25 and monthly respectively in addition speibase provides long term and reliable information on global drought and the time scales of spei is from month to 48 month scales the spatial temporal resolutions of spei used in this paper is monthly and 0 5 0 5 respectively 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 etp and spei calculation in this paper the etp and spei have been calculated on the basis of the pm and th models the th model is simple and only depends on temperature and latitude as shown in formula 1 karunarathne et al 2016 however the proposed algorithm only considers the contribution of heat factor to etp and ignores the aerodynamic factor therefore the etp in china is underestimated trajkovic et al 2019 although the contribution of aerodynamic factor to etp is relatively low the influence of aerodynamic factor on etp cannot be ignored with the change in climate in four seasons pm model considers the influence of heat and aerodynamic factors allen et al 1994 therefore the calculated etp is accurate eq 2 the commonly used drought indexes include spi palmer dry severity index pdsi and spei among them spei considers precipitation and evaporation as the two most important drought influencing factors that which can reflect the change in surface water balance comprehensively this index is also a continuous event function that can reflect the duration and accumulation of drought therefore spei is an ideal index for monitoring and evaluating drought under the background of global warming this index can reflect the drought situation under the accumulated rainfall in different time scales from 1 to 24 months and it is widely used globally vicente serrano et al 2011 ma et al 2020 the detailed calculation of etp can be referred to in karunarathne et al 2016 1 et p 0 t 0 16 k 10 t i m t 0 where t is the monthly mean temperature c and i is the heat index the method for obtaining k i and m can be referred to in vicente serrano et al 2010 in addition the method for calculating etp based on the pm model is expressed as follows monteith 1965 2 e t p 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 16 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where t is 2 m average air temperature c rn is the crop surface net radiation mj m 2 d 1 g is the soil heat flux mj m 2 d 1 u2 is the 2 m wind speed m s 1 es is the saturation vapor pressure kpa ea is the actual vapor pressure kpa δis the slope of the vapor pressure curve kpa 1 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 900 is the coefficient for the reference crop and 0 34 is the wind coefficient for the reference crop after the etp is obtained the monthly climatic water balance can be obtained by extracting the etp from precipitation finally the spei at different time scales can be calculated by accumulating the monthly climatic water balance of corresponding time scales and performing the log logistic standardization the detailed information of calculating spei can be referred to vicente serrano et al 2010 2 3 2 shf to estimate etp in china with high precision and spatial resolution this value is first calculated on the basis of the s rth model at 826 meteorological stations subsequently the model coefficients at each meteorological station have been determined finally shf is introduced to fit the model coefficients over entire china using the coefficients of s rth model at 826 meteorological stations the spherical harmonic model is expressed as follows zhao et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d 3 b shf φ λ n 0 n m 0 m a nm a nm b nm b nm where φ and λ represent the latitude and longitude of station or grid point respectively n and m are the maximum degree and order of shf respectively a nm and b nm are expressed as follows 4 a nm p nm sin φ cos m λ b nm p nm sin φ sin m λ where p nm t is the legendre function which is calculated as follows 5 p nm t 1 2 n 1 t 2 m 2 k 0 n m 2 1 k 2 n 2 k k n

estimated 3 experimental results and discussion 3 1 pwv calibration derived from era interim some observations obtained by gnss are missing because the gnss receiver failure or poor observation conditions fig 2 gives an example of the long time series of gnss derived 6 hourly pwv at xinn station 36 6006 n 101 7743 e and the interpolated data over the period of 1999 2015 it can be observed that the evident annual periodicity existed in pwv and the pwv value is the highest in summer and the lowest in winter in the paper the stations with more than 30 missing data are eliminated when selecting ground based gnss observations therefore 224 stations are left statistical result shows that the averaged missing rate of 224 gnss stations is 11 31 a ssa for missing data ssam method has been introduced to estimate the missing data according to the periodicity characteristic of pwv time series wang et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 although the pwv provided by the era interim has high spatial resolution its accuracy is worse than that derived from gnss zhang et al 2019 to ensure the reliability of the experiment era interim provided pwv is first calibrated using the cmonoc derived pwv at 224 gnss stations the era interim provided pwv data are interpolated into the 224 gnss stations using the bilinear interpolation method fig 3 shows the monthly pwv differences between era interim and gnss at 224 stations over the period of 1999 to 2015 the monthly pwv differences are large at different gnss stations and varies from 12 mm to 7 mm in addition the maximum pwv difference occurred in may to september with the value ranges from 5 mm to 12 mm the main reason of the large pwv difference in summer is the occurrence of high frequency rainfall event the atmospheric water vapor changes significantly during the rainfall and the era interim provided pwv cannot be well estimated under such cases benevides et al 2015 yao et al 2017 manandhar et al 2018 zhao et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d therefore era interim derived pwv is calibrated on a monthly scale using the gnss derived pwv the pwv differences between gnss and era interim is first obtained at the 224 stations subsequently the shf is introduced to fit these differences over entire china finally the grid based pwv data provided by the era interim is calibrated using the fitted pwv difference the specific process of calibrating the era interim pwv can be referred to the figure s1 in supplementary material to verify the performance of the calibrated pwv data only 149 gnss stations 2 3 are selected to establish the spherical harmonic model and the 75 other gnss stations 1 3 are used to evaluate the calibrated result here the shf with the degree and order are both 9 to fit the pwv residual fig 4 compares the internal and external accuracy of the calibrated and un calibrated pwv data at the gnss stations over the period of 1999 2015 the internal and external accuracy of the calibrated pwv data at each gnss station have been improved to different degrees statistical result reveals that the improvement rate of the proposed method for external and internal validations are approximately 15 over entire china table 2 shows the statistical result of the averaged rms and mean absolute error mae for the internal and external validations before and after calibration respectively the averaged rms and mae of the calibrated pwv have been improved to different degrees when compared with that from the uncalibrated conditions 3 2 establishment of s rth model 3 2 1 comparison of etp derived from different models the etp calculated using pm and th models at 826 meteorological stations is first compared over the period of 1979 to 2018 and fig 5 presents the averaged etp distribution of the meteorological stations derived from th and pm models as well as their difference etp is higher in the south and lower in the north of china and is gradually decreasing from south to north in addition the spatial distribution of etp derived from pm and th models varies especially in the western and northern china the etp difference in fig 5 c reveals that the regional difference of etp is very evident and the deviation value is between 80 mm and 20 mm th derived etp is underestimated in most areas of china especially in the northwestand central china in southeast china the th derived etp is overestimated which is consistent with the conclusions of previous studies van der schrier et al 2011 chen and sun 2015 this may be mainly caused by temperature the temperature in southeast china is higher than that in northwest china which leads to the etp difference between th and pm models in different regions van der schrier et al 2011 to improve the accuracy of the tm derived etp the etp difference between the pm and th models is obtained and analyzed using pwv temperature fig 6 shows the distribution of correlation coefficients between etp difference and pwv temperature over the period of 1979 to 2018 the correlation coefficients between etp difference and pwv temperature are 0 73 and 0 58 over the whole china in addition the correlation between etp difference and pwv temperature presents the same spatial distribution that is the southeast region has strong negative correlation whereas an opposite correlation existed in the northwest area the different correlation existed in china is mainly due to the over and under estimated etp by the th model as mentioned before that a strong linear relationship existed between etp difference and pwv temperature therefore a s rth model is proposed using the multilinear model as follows 7 s r t h etp t h etp f p w v t where s r t h etp and t h etp are the etp value estimated by the s rth and th models respectively f p w v t is the etp difference between pm and th model which can be expressed as 8 f p w v t b 0 b 1 p w v b 2 t where b 0 b 1 b 2 are the model coefficients to be estimated 3 2 2 validation of the s rth model th and s rth derived etp have been calculated and compared with the corresponding pm derived etp at 826 meteorological stations to evaluate the performance of the proposed s rth model the correlation of pm derived etp is first compared with that from th and s rth models over the period of 1979 2018 see fig 7 it can be observed that a higher correlation existed between pm and s rth derived etp in addition the long time series of etp derived from pm th and s rth models have been given in figure s2 see the supplementary material it found that s rth derived etp has a good consistency with that from pm model statistical result reveals the coefficients between th s rth and pm models are 0 91 and 0 96 respectively to quantitative evaluate the accuracy of proposed s rth model fig 8 presents the averaged rms and mae of etp difference between th s rth and pm model over the period of 1979 2018 the rms and mae of s rth is evidently lower than that from th especially for the west of china statistical result reveals that the averaged mae and rms of s rth model are 10 7 and 8 5 mm respectively whereas the values derived from the th model is 33 5 mm and 28 9 mm respectively therefore the s rth derived etp has been significantly improved compared with that from th model to describe the performance of the s rth model quantitatively an index called improvement rate is proposed and expressed as 9 irate r m s s r t h r m s th rm s th where irate is the improvement rate and rm s s r t h and rm s th are the rms values of the s rth and th models respectively fig 9 presents the improvement rate of s rth model at each meteorological station over the period of 1979 2018 the improvement rate at each station varies the corresponding value ranges from 35 to 85 and the averaged improvement rate over entire china is 68 the aforementioned results reveal that the proposed s rth model show a significant improvement when compared with the th model in addition only pwv and temperature are used to establish the model which greatly overcomes the problem that a lot of meteorological parameters are required when calculating the pm derived etp it can be concluded that the quality of th derived etp can be improved significantly only using the temperature and pwv which is mainly due to that 1 temperature is the main factor affecting the etp thornthwaite 1948 muniandy et al 2016 2 and pwv has a closely relationship with the surface evapotranspiration and vegetation zhao et al 2019a 2019b however the limitation of s rth model is also evident although the etp value can be calculated on the basis of s rth model at meteorological stations the values at other areas without meteorological data cannot be calculated thereby becoming the key issue required to be resolved 3 3 c rth model a novel rth model which is called china rth c rth model is proposed to obtain the etp values with high accuracy and spatial resolution this model can obtain etp with the spatial resolution of 0 125 0 125 on the premise of ensuring the accuracy of etp as mentioned in section 3 2 only the coefficients of b0 b1 and b2 of s rth model at 826 meteorological stations are obtained therefore the shf is applied to fit the corresponding coefficients of b0 b1 and b2 over the whole china respectively finally the grid based etp can be calculated using the fitted coefficients and pwv temperature at each grid point therefore the etp products with the same spatial resolution is generated in china because the spatial resolution of pwv and temperature provided by era interim is 0 125 the performance of the established coefficient model using the shf is first analyzed only the coefficients of b0 b1 and b2 of 549 2 3 stations are used to establish the model whereas the corresponding coefficients at 277 other 1 3 stations are selected as the external validation some experiments have been performed to determine the optimized degree and order of shf statistical result reveals that the smallest rms and mae can be obtained for b0 b1 and b2 whereas the values of 14 15 and 13 are selected for degree and order of shf fig 10 shows the scatter density diagram of the model coefficients of b0 b1 and b2 between shf and s rth under the cases of internal and external validations over entire china a good correlation existed between the shf and s rth derived coefficients of b0 b1 and b2 statistical result reveals that the correlation coefficients are 0 93 0 94 and 0 93 for b0 b1 and b2 between shf and s rth respectively such result verifies that the coefficients b0 b1 and b2 have been well fitted by the shf in china and can be used for calculating the etp value at grid point to further validate the performance of the fitted coefficients above the etp is calculated at 549 and 277selected meteorological stations using the established and fitted coefficients of shf respectively fig 11 presents the distributions of rms and mae of etp difference between c rth and pm models over the period of 1979 to 2018 for the cases of internal and external validations the etp derived from c rth model has a good performance at the selected meteorological stations in both cases most rms values range from 0 to 30 mm whereas the mae values range from 0 mm to 15 mm statistical result reveals that the rms and mae for the internal and external comparisons over the whole china are 13 1 10 6 mm and 12 8 10 3 mm respectively such comparison result reveals the good stability of the fitted coefficients and the fitted coefficients obtained by shf can be used to calculate etp value over the whole china 3 4 validation of etp derived from c rth model to further evaluate the performance of c rth model in the whole china the grid based etp values at one month scale with the spatial resolution of 0 125 0 125 are calculated over the period of 1979 2018 the site based etp at meteorological stations is also calculated on the basis of the pm and s rth models in addition the grid based etp is calculated using th model with the same spatial resolution as c rth model fig 12 presents the spatial distributions of the averaged etp derived from pm th sth and c rth models over the period of 1979 2018 the spatial distribution of c rth derived etp is similar to that from pm and s rth models in addition the etp distribution derived from th model is not consistent with those from the three other models the etp values at the meteorological stations are obtained by using the interpolated method using the grid based etp derived from c rth model and compared with that from the pm model in addition the independent etp products derived from mod16a2 and gldas are also used to further validate the proposed c rth model fig 13 gives the scatter plot of pm derived etp with that derived from th s rth c rth glads models and mod16a2 respectively it can be found that the etp derived from s rth and c rth models has a good consistency with that from pm model the th derived etp is underestimated while the modis and gldas derived etp is overestimated and this result is similar with the previous studies bai and liu 2018 degano et al 2020 duhan et al 2020 wen et al 2020 table 3 gives the statistical result of averaged rms mae and bias of etp difference between pm and th s rth c rth modis gldas model over the period of 2000 2018 it can be concluded that the averaged rms mae and bias of th modis gldas are larger than that from c rth and s rth models the averaged rms mae of etp difference between c rth and pm models are 17 6 and 13 7 mm respectively while the corresponding values between pm and s rth model are 10 7 and 8 5 mm respectively therefore the accuracy of s rth is the highest followed by c rth model th model and modis gldas is the worst although the quality of c rth model is slightly poorer than that of the s rth model the c rth model overcomes the disadvantages of low spatial resolution of s rth the etp values at the arbitrary location can be calculated on the basis of the c rth model under the cases of guaranteeing the accuracy of the etp values in addition although the spatial resolution of c rth model is lower than that of modis the accuracy of c rth derived etp is superior to that of modis therefore the c rth model can make up for the shortcomings of low spatial resolution and poor accuracy effectively which is of great significance for water cycle research and high spatial resolution drought index calculation 3 5 validation of spei derived from c rth model an important application of retrieving etp is to calculate the drought monitoring index therefore the spei with the spatial resolution of 0 125 0 125 is calculated on the basis of the c rth derived etp over the period of 1979 2018 the monthly precipitation data derived from cmfd is first preprocessed to unify the spatial resolution with that of ecmwf subsequently the spei can be calculated at different time scales vicente serrano et al 2010 the spei values at specific meteorological stations are also calculated on the basis of the pm model using the pwv and precipitation derived from cma at 1 to 24 month time scales in addition the grid based spei values derived from c rth model can also be interpolated into the meteorological stations using the bilinear interpolation method fig 14 shows the distribution of the site based averaged spei derived from pm model and grid based averaged spei derived from c rth model at 1 3 6 and 12 month scales over the period of 1979 2018 the spatial distribution of spei derived from pm and c rth models under different time scales are similar over the entire china areas with values greater and less than 0 indicate that the area is moist and drought respectively in addition the greater the absolute value of the spei is the more serious the humidity or drought will be according to the drought grade classification of spei provided by vicente serrano et al 2010 table 4 the first and second columns in fig 12 show a pattern of flooding in the south and drought in the north under the monthly 1 month scale seasonal 3 month scale and semi annual 6 month scale time scales which is consistent with the law of drought and flood distribution in china huijun 2002 ding et al 2009 spei with 12 month scale spei 12 mainly represents the hydrological drought paulo et al 2012 yao et al 2018 which is also derived from pm and c rth models in fig 12 j k spei 12 derived from pm and c rth models are relatively small and without obvious deviation thereby also indicating the capability of c rth model for hydrological drought in china to evaluate the c rth derived spei better the spei deviations between pm and c rth models have been calculated at 826 meteorological stations at the third column of fig 12 the spei deviation mainly concentrated in 0 5 to 0 5 at different time scales statistical result shows that the averaged bias of spei deviation at china are 0 11 0 07 0 22 and 0 002 for cases of 1 3 6 and 12 month scales respectively the aforementioned result verifies that c rth derived spei has a similar capacity with the pm derived spei for monitoring the drought wet at china under different time scales however c rth derived spei has an advantage of high spatial resolution which can also be used for monitoring drought for areas with some unavailable meteorological data to embody the advantage of calculated spei using the c rth model the comparison of spei product have been performed derived from pm c rth model and speibase fig 15 presents the distributions of correlation coefficients at each station between pm derived and c rth speibase derived spei over the period of 1979 2018 at 1 3 6 and 12 month scales it can be observed that the coefficient between speibase and pm model is low especially at 1 3 and 6 time scale in addition the coefficients between pm and c rth speibase derived spei have been given over the whole china see s3 in the supplementary material and the similar result is obtained as that in the comparison of fig 15 in addition the above result is consistent with that in wang et al 2019 the main reason is that the spebase derived spei is calculated using the global analyzed analysis cru ts3 2 which has an evident bias especially in the mountains shi et al 2017 4 conclusion in this paper a revised th model in china c rth has been proposed to overcome the disadvantages of low spatial resolution of pm model and low precision of th model the s rth model is first established to obtain the high precision etp values however such model can only obtain the etp values at specific meteorological stations to improve the spatial resolution of s rth model shf has been applied to fit coefficients b0 b1 and b2 of the s rth model derived from meteorological stations and then the model coefficients of the arbitrary location can be obtained in china therefore the grid based rth model in china c rth is established to calculate the etp with the spatial resolution of 0 125 0 125 using the fitted coefficients and ecmwf derived pwv and temperature finally the grid based spei is also obtained using the c rth derived etp and cmfd derived precipitation at china over the period of 1979 2018 site based and grid based meteorological data are selected to perform the experiment ecmwf derived pwv is first calibrated by the gnss derived pwv to guarantee the accuracy of grid based pwv data the etp derived from th s rth and c rth models have been compared with that from the pm model at the 826 meteorological stations statistical result shows that the s rth model has the best performance followed by c rth model although the quality of c rth model is slightly poorer than that of the s rth model c rth model solve the problem of low spatial resolution of traditional models effectively in addition the accuracy of the c rth model is significantly improved when compared with the th model finally the spei derived from c rth model is also compared with that from the pm model validated result verifies the capacity of c rth derived spei for drought wet monitoring in china at different time scales based on the good performance of c rth model for retrieving etp and spei at china we plan to release the first version of grid based etp and spei products in china c rth ver 1 0 such dataset includes the monthly etp and spei at grid points with the spatial resolution of 0 125 0 125 in china over the period of 1979 to 2018 we hope that such dataset is beneficial to scientific research and drought monitoring application some or all data models or

of the monte desert are subject to intense transformations by humans and livestock and offer a unique opportunity to understand how phreatophyte vegetation groundwater rainfall variability and vertical solute fluxes connect with each other in this ecosystem we evaluated the consequences of heavy disturbance by livestock settlements partial tree removal intense grazing on shallow 7 15 m deep groundwater recharge discharge dynamics and vertical solute nutrients and salts transport we compared three relatively undisturbed woodlands with three paired livestock stations in the telteca reserve mendoza argentina at these locations we monitored groundwater levels and chemical and isotopic compositions during six years 2011 2017 seasonal groundwater level fluctuations reflected shifts in water demand lower in the cold season rather than rainfall high in the warm season as shown by fall winter rises and spring summer declines these seasonal fluctuations were more intense in undisturbed woodlands than in livestock stations at a shorter time scale intense rainfall events were associated to groundwater level raises suggesting a partial decoupling of phreatophyte vegetation from the free aquifer and less likely recharge episodes livestock stations also affected groundwater chemistry by locally increasing chloride and nitrate concentrations and salinity suggesting higher water percolation and nitrate leaching to the aquifer in livestock stations than in control woodlands this study addressed ecohydrological processes which are necessary to understand the coupling between

between vegetation soils and groundwater that are not only mediated by water but also by solutes nutrients salts jobbágy and jackson 2007 prosopis woodlands of the monte desert offer a unique opportunity to understand how such coupled vegetation and hydrologic dynamics are affected by different disturbance conditions traditional livestock settlements and their extensive grazing produce focused disturbances in the woodlands decrease plant cover and affect the spatial distribution of soil resources goirán et al 2012 meglioli et al 2017 in highly grazed woodlands combined effects of vegetation removal and manure deposition favor the vertical movement of water nitrates and solutes through the soil profile to the aquifer meglioli et al 2014 land use intensity changes can differentially affect not only the rates of water consumption and fluctuations in groundwater levels but also water quality for livestock and humans the imprint of phreatophytes on shallow groundwater level fluctuations may be analyzed at different time scales loheide et al 2005 orellana et al 2012 seasonal fluctuations may emerge in response to vegetation activity dormant vs active season and or potential evapotranspiration low vs high atmospheric water demand shifts which in the case of our study region would imply spring summer declines and fall winter rises of groundwater levels yet they can also respond to a direct recharge following precipitation seasonality which under the monsoonal climate of our study region would imply spring summer rises and fall winter declines at the daily scale groundwater uptake by trees can result into daytime declines and nighttime rises that are proportional to groundwater consumption rates and reflect sustained lateral subsidies supporting nocturnal level recoveries jobbágy and jackson 2004 lautz 2008 loheide et al 2005 white 1932 rainfall events can interrupt these fluctuations without generating a recharge pulse just by offering plants a preferential water sources that temporarily halts groundwater consumption giménez et al 2016 jobbágy and jackson 2004 in the prosopis woodlands of the interdune lowlands of the monte desert woodland connections to groundwater have been evidenced byseasonal patterns of vegetation greenness with remote sensing data contreras et al 2011 and by characterizing the stable isotopic compositions of rainfall soil groundwater and xylem water jobbágy et al 2011 to better understand the influence of phreatophytic vegetation and human disturbances on groundwater dynamics the integration of multiple approaches including water table level fluctuations groundwater chemical and isotopic composition can be helpful herczeg and leaney 2011 white and broadley 2001 isotopic approaches in water can lead us to a better understanding of hydrological and ecological process for instance to recognize the source of groundwater recharge or to establish the dependence of vegetation on groundwater in our arid ecosystem mcguire and mcdonnell 2008 we hypothesized that phreatophytes exert a strong control on groundwater levels in the interdune lowlands of the monte desert that follow their leaf phenology and its interaction with potential evapotranspiration trends manifested as warm season level falls and cold season level rises as well as sustained diurnal level fluctuations in the warm season we expected rainfall events to halt groundwater consumption but doubted that they could trigger recharge events manifested as interrupted diurnal level fluctuations but a lack of isotopic composition changes in the highly disturbed conditions of livestock settlements we expected a relaxation of the vegetation control of groundwater levels manifested as a greater recovery of groundwater levels lower seasonal and diurnal fluctuations and a more variable and occasionally more rainfall like isotopic composition in groundwater in disturbed sites we also expected a higher transport of solutes both nutrients and salts from the surface and vadose zone to the groundwater manifested as higher and more variable nitrate phosphate chloride and total salts concentrations in groundwater guided by these hypotheses and their predictions we monitored groundwater levels and chemical and isotopic composition at six interdune lowlands representing the typical undisturbed and disturbed conditions of natural woodlands and livestock stations respectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the monte desert rundel et al 2007 specifically in the telteca natural and cultural reserve at the northeast of mendoza province argentina 32 23 s 68 01 w 500 550 m a s l the area includes several geomorphological formations mainly dominated by sandy aeolian plains where the phreatic aquifer is reached by vegetation in inter dune valleys but not in dune flanks or crests jobbágy et al 2011 villagra et al 2013 these plains are composed of holocene fluvial and aeolian sediments including entisols with poorly developed horizons of recent origin gomez et al 2014 the climate presents extreme temperatures varying from 10 c in winter to 48 c in summer and low mean annual rainfall close to 160 mm year 1 climate records during 1971 2017 concentrated mostly in spring and summer from october to march magliano et al 2015 plant communities of the monte desert include xerophytic woody vegetation adapted to extreme droughts as the shrubby steppes composed of larrea divaricata bulnesia retama tricomaria usillo atriplex lampa and suaeda divaricata and the open woodlands dominated by the deciduous tree p flexuosa alvarez et al 2006 rundel et al 2007 villagra et al 2011 p flexuosa woodland is a community with primary productivity above that expected from local precipitation alone contreras et al 2011 this is mainly because p flexuosa with its large extended root system reaches the accessible groundwater in interdune valleys guevara et al 2010 due to these features such ecosystems where part of the water demand is supplied by groundwater can be considered groundwater dependent orellana et al 2012 historically huarpe local communities have inhabited these lands using woodland resources for their subsistence however the development of the irrigated oases in the mendoza and san juan provinces led to the clearing of thousands of hectares of woodlands for building railroads and vineyards during the early xx century currently the remaining woodlands are protected at national level by the native forest law n 26331 gobierno de la república argentina 2009 the telteca reserve conforms a protected area created to preserve both the prosopis woodlands and the huarpe culture in 1985 by the province law n 5061 gobierno de mendoza 1985 presently local populations still live in this area and use woodland and groundwater resources to support livestock production mainly goats such traditional economic activity implies the partial removal of woody vegetation within the woodland conforming sacrifice areas to build hand dug wells corrals and houses extensive grazing generates disturbance gradients which are perceived as a reduction of plant coverage up to 2 km away from livestock settlements goirán et al 2012 magliano et al 2019 the sandy aeolian plains of northeast mendoza contain an unconfined aquifer with phreatic levels located at 7 15 m depth in inter dune valleys the regional direction of groundwater flow in our study area is southwest to northeast gomez et al 2014 although the aquifer is characterized by poor quality groundwater with particularly high saline and arsenic contents the local population extracts groundwater from hand drilled wells for livestock and human consumption gomez et al 2019 therefore groundwater constitutes the most important water source for settlement establishment and livestock subsistence villagra et al 2013 for this research we limited our monitoring of groundwater levels and chemistry to disturbed livestock stations and undisturbed woodlands control woodlands of the aeolian plain 2 2 experimental design we selected three livestock stations and three control woodlands in the sandy aeolian plain to evaluate the features and temporal variability of groundwater livestock stations were considered highly disturbed interdune valleys by livestock and human activities whereas control woodlands located at approximately 2 km distance from each paired livestock station represented relatively undisturbed stands figure 1 six boreholes piezometers were placed in interdune valleys three in each disturbance condition n 3 in 2010 meglioli et al 2014 each borehole drilled extending 0 8 m below the water table level was used to measure groundwater depth and collect water samples a description of study sites and their characteristics is provided in table 1 the groundwater depths were similar for both land uses ranging from 8 3 to 9 5 m livestock stations had greater distances from a p flexuosa tree to its nearest woody plant i e lower tree density moreover livestock stations had lower total vegetation cover and higher manure cover i e higher land use intensity than control woodlands 2 3 meteorological data daily rainfall was recorded from the meteorological station red ambiental iadiza conicet mendoza www mendoza conicet gob ar ladyot 32 22 59 0 s 68 03 14 0 w at the telteca reserve during 2011 2017 experimental period we complemented meteorological information with air temperature c and relative humidity sensors placed in the study area hobo pro data logger fig 2 2 4 groundwater level measurements groundwater depth vertical distance between the surface and the water table was measured manually at two to four month intervals in each borehole from november 2011 to september 2017 additionally pressure transducers hobo water level logger onset computer corporation bourne massachusetts usa were installed to provide continuous measures of the groundwater levels the pressure transducers were programmed to store the date time pressure and temperature every hour sensors suspended above the water table in the boreholes recorded the barometric pressure and those submerged at a fixed position in the borehole recorded the barometric plus water column pressure by subtraction of these two values and correcting for density changes with temperature almost nul at these sites we obtained the height of the water column and from it water table levels hourly data were used to obtain average daily groundwater depth values groundwater fluctuations were corrected according to the manual groundwater depth measures of each borehole because of the deficient functioning of pressure transducers it was not possible to obtain continuous records at all boreholes during all the experimental period however complete time series data were gathered for each land use type from september 2014 to september 2017 encompassing different environmental conditions given by the variability of spring and summer rainfall pulses 2 5 groundwater chemical analyses groundwater samples were taken after each borehole was purged to ensure that the sample was representative of aquifer conditions samples were collected in polyethylene bottles previously washed with distilled water and they were refrigerated until analysis in ianigla cct conicet mendoza laboratories groundwater samplings were obtained every three to four months from november 2011 to june 2016 five sampling periods in these samples we measured ph electric conductivity ec in situ and chloride cl concentrations in the laboratory with selective electrodes using a multiparametric meter thermo scientific orion nitrate no3 and phosphate po4 3 concentrations were determined with a cadmium reduction with nitraver5 pillows hach company 2007 and molybdenum blue methods murphy and riley 1962 respectively using a spectrophotometer hach dr 2800 hach loveland usa additional samples were collected from all boreholes and domestic wells of each livestock station for ionic composition in june 2014 in domestic wells groundwater is freely exposed to the atmospheric conditions and to inputs of sediments from the surface in these samples we determined major anions so4 2 co3 2 hco3 cl and cations na k ca2 mg2 co3 2 hco3 ca2 mg2 na and k were analyzed following standard methods of american public health association apha et al 1995 with volumetric methods for co3 2 hco3 ca2 mg2 and spectrometric flame method for na and k metrolab 315 flame photometer so4 2

multiparametric meter thermo scientific orion star 2 6 groundwater isotopic analyses we sampled groundwater from all boreholes at two to three times in three consecutive growth periods covering the spring summer and fall winter seasons from 2013 to 2016 groundwater samples were collected into 15 ml falcon tubes which were sealed with parafilm immediately after sampling to avoid evaporation and placed in a cooler in the field the tubes were stored in the refrigerator until isotopic determination stable isotope analyses were conducted at the laboratory of grupo de estudios ambientales imasl

precision vaporizer overall analytical precision of the spectrometer was estimated at 0 5 and 0 1 for δ2h and δ18o respectively stable isotope data were expressed in delta notation relative to vienna standard mean ocean water v smow and to an internal laboratory standard mendoza river water calibrated against international reference materials δ is defined as eq 1 1 δ rsample rstandard 1 1000 where rsample and rstandard are 2h 1h or 18o 16o 2 7 statistical analysis we made descriptive comparisons of groundwater fluctuations for control woodlands and livestock stations determining periods of rising and falling levels based on manual measurements of groundwater depths and continuous records provided by pressure transducers from september 2014 to september 2017 in order to analyze differences in groundwater level changes between both disturbance conditions we i made visual interpretation of the patterns of each temporal series and fitted a smooth function to this general trend using generalized additive models the optimal spline can be found using the generalized cross validation criterion ii discounted the relative changes in groundwater depths obtained from livestock station minus those obtained from control woodland at exactly the same time and iii calculated the groundwater daily change rate i e slope from one day to the next one cm d 1 of each temporal series then we compared the groundwater daily change rate of the control woodland and livestock stations by using the mann whitney u analysis this non parametric test was used because the distribution of data was not normal a significance level of 0 01 was determined to assume statistical differences chemical characteristics of groundwater were plotted on piper diagrams piper 1944 then we assessed the effects of disturbance condition d season s and sampling period p on groundwater chemistry using linear mixed models lmms we fitted models considering disturbance condition control woodland vs livestock station season spring summer vs fall winter and sampling periods five levels as fixed factors and paired sites as a random factor with regressive autocorrelation variance structure corar1 classical linear models assume an equal variance of errors however it is possible to model heteroscedasticity in lmms from variance functions to relax the homoscedasticity assumption oddi et al 2020 hence we considered the heteroscedasticity in each lmm by modeling the variance structure weight varident form 1 site then all combinations of fixed factors with their interactions were assessed and ranked using the akaike information criterion aic the selection of the best models and parameter estimation was performed by the inference of multiple models with the dredge function from package mumin barton 2019 the models that were within four aic of the lowest value were retained to obtain parameter estimates and their confidences intervals we used akaike weights w to generate weighted estimate burnham and anderson 2002 the statistical analyses were carried out using the r statistical environment r development core team 2019 we assessed the effects of disturbance condition season and sampling period three periods on natural abundance of hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes in groundwater using linear mixed models following the same statistical analysis described for the chemical variables in addition the stable isotopic composition of groundwater samples was compared with the global meteoric water line craig 1961 the local evaporation line gomez et al 2014 and the local rainfall and river water samples obtained from previous studies jobbágy et al 2011 3 results 3 1 groundwater fluctuations groundwater levels in the livestock station remained above those of the control woodland with a time series that tends to separate in time we observed a seasonal pattern in both time series with spring summer declines and fall winter rises fig 3 a as shown in this figure the fitted trend in groundwater levels can be plotted as a smooth function of time using a gams for each land use appendix table a1 for details of the fitted gams moreover the spring summer decline was interrupted by precipitation pulses with groundwater levels rising or remaining constant in both disturbance conditions the livestock station temporal series presented higher values than the control woodland for the whole period explored while the control woodland presented higher seasonal variation differences between minimum and maximum values than the livestock station fig 3a level differences indicated that throughout the whole period the disturbed site had an overall rise with differences increasing in the fall winter seasons fig 3b groundwater daily change rates presented differences between the two land uses fig 3c the control woodland displayed higher daily changes than the livestock station p 0 01 although the differences of the daily changes were found through the time series they became particularly higher at the end of the dry seasons where the air temperature was increasing but precipitation had not started yet fig 2 3 2 chemical composition the groundwater chemistry can be explored by plotting major cation and anion concentrations on a piper trilinear diagram the order of cation dominance was na ca2 mg2 k and the order of anions was so4 2 cl hco3 for anions in both land uses na so4 cl was the predominant groundwater type fig 4 variations in groundwater chemical composition depended on the disturbance condition season and sampling period thus candidate models those with daic 4 included all combinations of fixed factors with their interactions table 2 the ph values were neutral to alkaline ranging from 6 5 to 8 2 in both disturbance conditions over time fig 5 a the best model for ph included all interactions among the main explaining factors consequently groundwater ph was determined by the integration of land use season and sampling period electrical conductivity was always higher in livestock stations than in control woodlands and varied according to the seasons and sampling periods the top ranked models with daic 4 included the three main explaining factors and the interaction between disturbance condition and season fig 5b cl concentrations were also higher in livestock stations 375 mg l on average than in control woodlands in the 2014 2015 period cl concentrations increased with respect to other sampling periods in both disturbance conditions from lmms differences in cl between land uses were kept relatively constant during sampling periods fig 5c no3 concentrations differed between the two disturbance conditions with higher values in livestock stations moreover in control woodlands the average no3 concentrations were constant at 3 mg l over time while in livestock stations they decreased from to 19 mg l to 4 mg l fig 5d so models that included interactive effects among disturbance condition season and sampling period had lower aic and maximum weight waic of the model set considered po4 3 concentrations were higher in livestock stations with differences increasing in recent sampling periods fig 5e several candidate models had similar empirical support to explain the changes of groundwater po4 3 table 2 in the supplementary data we shown the parameter estimates for each chemical variable appendix table a2 3 3 isotope composition over time groundwater in livestock stations was slightly enriched in heavier isotopes δ2h and δ18o compared to control woodlands we also found changes in isotope composition that depended on the sampling period with differences between both disturbance conditions that tended to decrease over time in control woodlands δ18o and δ2h values ranged from a minimum of 18 48 and 138 8 in winter 2014 to maximum of 16 46 and 127 9 in summer 2013 respectively in contrast in livestock stations δ18o and δ2h values ranged from a minimum of 17 82 and 135 1 in winter 2016 to a maximum of 13 48 and 113 0 in summer 2013 respectively fig 6 a and fig 6b as a result the best models for both water isotopes were those that included the interaction between all fixed effects table 2 in the supplementary data we show the parameter estimates for each isotopic variable appendix table a3 for comparative purposes in fig 6c we included samples of soil water summer rainfall and mendoza river water using data from a previous study we found that isotopic compositions of groundwater in both disturbance conditions were close to the signature of mendoza river water and distinct from local rainfalls however groundwater samples in livestock stations showed isotopic composition with some degree of evaporative enrichment as occurred in isotopic profiles in vegetated lowlands indicating isolated rainfall fed zones soil water in bare lowlands was isotopically similar to rainfall fig 6c 4 discussion the comparison of groundwater levels and chemistry under disturbed and undisturbed woodlands in the monte desert indicate different influences of disturbances on the hydrological and chemical processes of the aquifer the partial removal of vegetation and intense grazing in livestock settlements had consequences on groundwater dynamics at different temporal scales at the inter annual scale groundwater depths tended to decrease slightly from 2014 to 2017 in the control woodland while remained relatively stable in livestock station fig 3 such differences were related to earlier recovery during the winter level in disturbed sites in the livestock station the fall of the groundwater level was not so marked compared to the control woodland probably due to lower consumption of groundwater by phreatophytes lower plant cover table 1 variations in groundwater depths could have site dependent responses where multiple factors determine the dynamics of changes for example the number of phreatophytes in space density the size of the trees height root depth and the use of water according to physiological needs and meteorological conditions determine an integrated response for each site that affects water table fluctuations at the seasonal scale groundwater depth fluctuations occurred in response to vegetation activity shifts determining spring summer declines and fall winter rises of water table levels fig 3a such seasonal variations sustain the hypothesis that phreatophytes their leaf phenology and meteorological conditions strongly influence groundwater fluctuations p flexuosa the main species coupled to groundwater is a deciduous tree that loses their leaves in winter alvarez and villagra 2009 in coincidence with groundwater level recovery our results agree with aforementioned studies showing that lowlands are groundwater discharging areas contreras et al 2011 jobbágy et al 2011 however these seasonal fluctuations were more intense in control woodlands than in livestock stations on a time scale of days to a week the main controls over the use of groundwater by phreatophyte vegetation are variations in meteorological conditions such as irradiance air temperature atmospheric humidity vapor pressure deficit and wind which determine the rates of evapotranspiration butler et al 2007 loheide et al 2005 phreatophytic vegetation transpires during the daytime groundwater consumption and discharge decreasing groundwater depths similarly during the night the phreatic level recovers due to the net income given by horizontal water movement dzikiti et al 2013 jobbágy and jackson 2004 loheide et al 2005 orellana et al 2012 white 1932 previous comparisons of p flexuosa ecophysiological responses in the same sites indicated that the trees remaining in livestock stations appear to grow under a less stressful environment improved water and nutritional status with more soil resources meglioli et al 2016 the phreatophyte control on groundwater dynamics was likely relaxing in livestock stations determining a lower groundwater consumption by p flexuosa at a fine time scale we detected that the seasonal pattern of decline that occurs during the vegetative growth season spring summer was interrupted by rainfall events as a result after precipitation events the phreatic fall was delayed in both land use conditions these results suggest a partial decoupling of phreatophytes from the aquifer due to the availability of soil surface water and they support previous studies that indicate p flexuosa ability to respond to unpredictable pulses of water availability debandi et al 2020 guevara et al 2010 in control woodlands the rise in groundwater levels although lower than in livestock station for the rainy period could be attributed to the indirect effects of rainfall on the aquifer due to a reduction in groundwater consumption by the phreatophyte vegetation that is compensated by increased absorption of rainwater from the surface soil our data suggest that multiple plants in the interdune valleys of our study sites use groundwater through their deep root systems such as p flexuosa p alpataco geoffroea decorticans atamisquea emarginata alvarez and villagra 2009 jobbágy et al 2011 vega riveros et al 2011 villagra et al 2011 recent studies based on the analysis of soil profiles indicate that livestock stations function as foci of local recharge meglioli et al 2014 by integrating the piezometric records chloride soil profiles stable isotope composition of groundwater and precipitation the hydrological dynamics of the monte desert could be discussed with different methodological approaches the stable isotopes of groundwater in both disturbance conditions were congruent with those previously reported for the study area which determined that groundwater is isotopically lighter than summer rainfalls the isotopic signature of the groundwater was close to the water of the mendoza river aranibar et al 2011 gomez et al 2014 jobbágy et al 2011 indicating that remote aquifer recharge processes are predominant in the contributions of water however slightly more isotopically enriched groundwater was found in livestock stations than in control woodlands with differences decreasing over time fig 6 these relative changes between undisturbed and disturbed conditions of woodlands have been caused by local recharge which mix groundwater with summer rainwater in livestock stations as suggested by isotopic and biochemical evidences in this study livestock stations showed changes in groundwater chemistry presenting higher electrical conductivity cl no3 and po4 3 concentrations in groundwater fig 5 these increases could be caused by indirect effects of livestock goats and cows which capture and transport nutrients from a broad grazing range and deposit excrement and urine into highly disturbed sites pastoralist settlements providing solutes and nutrients to the soils meglioli et al 2017 according to previous studies livestock stations indicate increased water infiltration and mobilization of salts and no3 from the surface soils to the aquifer i e local groundwater recharge in contrast control woodlands show no evidence of vertical flow of water and solutes jobbágy et al 2011 meglioli et al 2014 cl concentrations which indicate a recharge regime in deserts and are inversely proportional to downstream water flow herczeg and leaney 2011 phillips 1994 scanlon 1991 were higher in groundwater samples of livestock stations than in control woodlands representing evidence of increased vertical water flow in disturbed sites fig 5b we also found higher no3 and po4 3 concentrations in groundwater samples from livestock stations than in control woodlands although it tended to decrease over time for nitrate fig 5 rainwater percolates to deeper layers diluting the salts and leaching nutrients accumulated in the soil until reaching the aquifer stadler et al 2008 no3 ions have higher mobility compared to po4 3 rivett et al 2008 having higher potential flows during rainy events livestock stations increased no3 concentrations and five samples exceeded the maximum limit established for human consumption at the beginning of the sampling period código alimentario argentino 2007 deteriorating the quality of this water resource in the rainy period 2015 2016 of high intensity and frequent rainy pulses the increase of no3 in groundwater were not detected as expected even in the following months interestingly when cl reached their maximum peak in this rainy period no3 decreased to their minimum values in livestock stations this supports the idea that at livestock stations previous local recharges diluted cl and recharged no3 the accumulated rainfall in the soil profile its storage and subsequent drainage present a delay in time that does not allow a response to be visualized in the short term the horizontal movement of groundwater in the telteca aquifer with a regional velocity estimated between 0 1 and 0 25 m day aranibar et al 2011 could contribute to the dilution of the no3 content over time in the event that the velocity exceeds the no3 inputs into the aquifer by downward flow solutes can be transported via the groundwater to other areas of natural woodlands following the southwest northeast flow direction determined for the study area gomez et al 2014 in conclusion in this study it was possible to reconstruct free aquifer level dynamics and its relationship with local rainfall in undisturbed and disturbed woodlands of the monte desert several factors can influence aquifer recharge discharge processes and consequently the hydrology dynamics including topography type and cover of vegetation soil characteristics e g type of sediments depths of the aquifer local precipitation land use anthropogenic activities and climate change banks et al 2011 butler et al 2007 giménez et al 2016 newman et al 2006 we found that both disturbance conditions maintained similar fluctuations in groundwater levels throughout the years with declines progressing during spring summer and a recovery during fall and winter however small differences between both land uses during rainfall pulses suggests that groundwater in livestock stations is more sensitive to precipitation than in control woodlands it would be interesting to confirm these results with longer time periods and higher number of phreatimeters in desert ecosystems there are still few records of groundwater level fluctuations and groundwater quality kim and jackson 2012 taylor et al 2013 the partial removal of vegetation and intense grazing in livestock settlements produce changes on groundwater chemistry and alter the quality of this water reservoir the cl and isotopic results provide evidence of higher transport of rain water and solutes from the surface and vadose zone into the groundwater suggesting increasing local recharge and no3 leaching in livestock stations this study helps us to better understand the influence of phreatophyte woodlands and the effects of land use change on groundwater dynamics in the coming years more efforts are needed to continue monitoring groundwater which is a key resource

of the monte desert are subject to intense transformations by humans and livestock and offer a unique opportunity to understand how phreatophyte vegetation groundwater rainfall variability and vertical solute fluxes connect with each other in this ecosystem we evaluated the consequences of heavy disturbance by livestock settlements partial tree removal intense grazing on shallow 7 15 m deep groundwater recharge discharge dynamics and vertical solute nutrients and salts transport we compared three relatively undisturbed woodlands with three paired livestock stations in the telteca reserve mendoza argentina at these locations we monitored groundwater levels and chemical and isotopic compositions during six years 2011 2017 seasonal groundwater level fluctuations reflected shifts in water demand lower in the cold season rather than rainfall high in the warm season as shown by fall winter rises and spring summer declines these seasonal fluctuations were more intense in undisturbed woodlands than in livestock stations at a shorter time scale intense rainfall events were associated to groundwater level raises suggesting a partial decoupling of phreatophyte vegetation from the free aquifer and less likely recharge episodes livestock stations also affected groundwater chemistry by locally increasing chloride and nitrate concentrations and salinity suggesting higher water

functions and services to people and include some of the preferred environments in the region for the establishment of permanent livestock settlements of local people alvarez and villagra 2009 villagra et al 2013 this study explores how these settlements affect the groundwater resource that supported their establishment and hence affect their long term sustainability deep rooted plants including woody phreatophytes like many prosopis trees are a valued component of arid groundwater coupled ecosystems because they exert strong controls on water cycle and influence both vadose and groundwater zone processes dzikiti et al 2013 fan et al 2017 le maitre et al 1999 naumburg et al 2005 these plants can affect the recharge and discharge dynamics of groundwater by consuming rainfall inputs in the unsaturated zone or by tapping groundwater and its capillary fringe directly devitt and bird 2016 wilcox et al 2017 moreover groundwater consumption by plants leads complex feedbacks between vegetation soils and groundwater that are not only mediated by water but also by solutes nutrients salts jobbágy and jackson 2007 prosopis woodlands of the monte desert offer a unique opportunity to understand how such coupled vegetation and hydrologic dynamics are affected by different disturbance conditions traditional livestock settlements and their extensive grazing produce focused disturbances in the woodlands decrease plant cover and affect the spatial distribution of soil resources goirán et al 2012 meglioli et al 2017 in highly grazed woodlands combined effects of vegetation removal and manure deposition favor the vertical movement of water nitrates and solutes through the soil profile to the aquifer meglioli et al 2014 land use intensity changes can differentially affect not only the rates of water consumption and fluctuations in groundwater levels but also water quality for livestock and humans the imprint of phreatophytes on shallow groundwater level fluctuations may be analyzed at different time scales loheide et al 2005 orellana et al 2012 seasonal fluctuations may emerge in response to vegetation activity dormant vs active season and or potential evapotranspiration low vs high atmospheric water demand shifts which in the case of our study region would imply spring summer declines and fall winter rises of groundwater levels yet they can also respond to a direct recharge following precipitation seasonality which under the monsoonal climate of our study region would imply spring summer rises and fall winter declines at the daily scale groundwater uptake by trees can result into daytime declines and nighttime rises that are proportional to groundwater consumption rates and reflect sustained lateral subsidies supporting nocturnal level recoveries jobbágy and jackson 2004 lautz 2008 loheide et al 2005 white 1932 rainfall events can interrupt these fluctuations without generating a recharge pulse just by offering plants a preferential water sources that temporarily halts groundwater consumption giménez et al 2016 jobbágy and jackson 2004 in the prosopis woodlands of the interdune lowlands of the monte desert woodland connections to groundwater have been evidenced byseasonal patterns of vegetation greenness with remote sensing data contreras et al 2011 and by characterizing the stable isotopic compositions of rainfall soil groundwater and xylem water jobbágy et al 2011 to better understand the influence of phreatophytic vegetation and human disturbances on groundwater dynamics the integration of multiple approaches including water table level fluctuations groundwater chemical and isotopic composition can be helpful herczeg and leaney 2011 white and broadley 2001 isotopic approaches in water can lead us to a better understanding of hydrological and ecological process for instance to recognize the source of groundwater recharge or to establish the dependence of vegetation on groundwater in our arid ecosystem mcguire and mcdonnell 2008 we hypothesized that phreatophytes exert a strong control on groundwater levels in the interdune lowlands of the monte desert that follow their leaf phenology and its interaction with potential evapotranspiration trends manifested as warm season level falls and cold season level rises as well as sustained diurnal level fluctuations in the warm season we expected rainfall events to halt groundwater consumption but doubted that they could trigger recharge events manifested as interrupted diurnal level fluctuations but a lack of isotopic composition changes in the highly disturbed conditions of livestock settlements we expected a relaxation of the vegetation control of groundwater levels manifested as a greater recovery of groundwater levels lower seasonal and diurnal fluctuations and a more variable and occasionally more rainfall like isotopic composition in groundwater in disturbed sites we also expected a higher transport of solutes both nutrients and salts from the surface and vadose zone to the groundwater manifested as higher and more variable nitrate phosphate chloride and total salts concentrations in groundwater guided by these hypotheses and their predictions we monitored groundwater levels and chemical and isotopic composition at six interdune lowlands representing the typical undisturbed and disturbed conditions of natural woodlands and livestock stations respectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the monte desert rundel et al 2007 specifically in the telteca natural and cultural reserve at the northeast of mendoza province argentina 32 23 s 68 01 w 500 550 m a s l the area includes several geomorphological formations mainly dominated by sandy aeolian plains where the phreatic aquifer is reached by vegetation in inter dune valleys but not in dune flanks or crests jobbágy et al 2011 villagra et al 2013 these plains are composed of holocene fluvial and aeolian sediments including entisols with poorly developed horizons of recent origin gomez et al 2014 the climate presents extreme temperatures varying from 10 c in winter to 48 c in summer and low mean annual rainfall close to 160 mm year 1 climate records during 1971 2017 concentrated mostly in spring and summer from october to march magliano et al 2015 plant communities of the monte desert include xerophytic woody vegetation adapted to extreme droughts as the shrubby steppes composed of larrea divaricata bulnesia retama tricomaria usillo atriplex lampa and suaeda divaricata and the open woodlands dominated by the deciduous tree p flexuosa alvarez et al 2006 rundel et al 2007 villagra et al 2011 p flexuosa woodland is a community with primary productivity above that expected from local precipitation alone contreras et al 2011 this is mainly because p flexuosa with its large extended root system reaches the accessible groundwater in interdune valleys guevara et al 2010 due to these features such ecosystems where part of the water demand is supplied by groundwater can be considered groundwater dependent orellana et al 2012 historically huarpe local communities have inhabited these lands using woodland resources for their subsistence however the development of the irrigated oases in the mendoza and san juan provinces led to the clearing of thousands of hectares of woodlands for building railroads and vineyards during the early xx century currently the remaining woodlands are protected at national level by the native forest law n 26331 gobierno de la república argentina 2009 the telteca reserve conforms a protected area created to preserve both the prosopis woodlands and the huarpe culture in 1985 by the province law n 5061 gobierno de mendoza 1985 presently local populations still live in this area and use woodland and groundwater resources to support livestock production mainly goats such traditional economic activity implies the partial removal of woody vegetation within the woodland conforming sacrifice areas to build hand dug wells corrals and houses extensive grazing generates disturbance gradients which are perceived as a reduction of plant coverage up to 2 km away from livestock settlements goirán et al 2012 magliano et al 2019 the sandy aeolian plains of northeast mendoza contain an unconfined aquifer with phreatic levels located at 7 15 m depth in inter dune valleys the regional direction of groundwater flow in our study area is southwest to northeast gomez et al 2014 although the aquifer is characterized by poor quality groundwater with particularly high saline and arsenic contents the local population extracts groundwater from hand drilled wells for livestock and human consumption gomez et al 2019 therefore groundwater constitutes the most important water source for settlement establishment and livestock subsistence villagra et al 2013 for this research we limited our monitoring of groundwater levels and chemistry to disturbed livestock stations and undisturbed woodlands control woodlands of the aeolian plain 2 2 experimental design we selected three livestock stations and three control woodlands in the sandy aeolian plain to evaluate the features and temporal variability of groundwater livestock stations were considered highly disturbed interdune valleys by livestock and human activities whereas control woodlands located at approximately 2 km distance from each paired livestock station represented relatively undisturbed stands figure 1 six boreholes piezometers were placed in interdune valleys three in each disturbance condition n 3 in 2010 meglioli et al 2014 each borehole drilled extending 0 8 m below the water table level was used to measure groundwater depth and collect water samples a description of study sites and their characteristics is provided in table 1 the groundwater depths were similar for both land uses ranging from 8 3 to 9 5 m livestock stations had greater distances from a p flexuosa tree to its nearest woody plant i e lower tree density moreover livestock stations had lower total vegetation cover and higher manure cover i e higher land use intensity than control woodlands 2 3 meteorological data daily rainfall was recorded from the meteorological station red ambiental iadiza conicet mendoza www mendoza conicet gob ar ladyot 32 22 59 0 s

pro data logger fig 2 2 4 groundwater level measurements groundwater depth vertical distance between the surface and the water table was measured manually at two to four month intervals in each borehole from november 2011 to september 2017 additionally pressure transducers hobo water level logger onset computer corporation bourne massachusetts usa were installed to provide continuous measures of the groundwater levels the pressure transducers were programmed to store the date time pressure and temperature every hour sensors suspended above the water table in the boreholes recorded the barometric pressure and those submerged at a fixed position in the borehole recorded the barometric plus water column pressure by subtraction of these two values and correcting for density changes with temperature almost nul at these sites we obtained the height of the water column and from it water table levels hourly data were used to obtain average daily groundwater depth values groundwater fluctuations were corrected according to the manual groundwater depth measures of each borehole because of the deficient functioning of pressure transducers it was not possible to obtain continuous records at all boreholes during all the experimental period however complete time series data were gathered for each land use type from september 2014 to september 2017 encompassing different environmental conditions given by the variability of spring and summer rainfall pulses 2 5 groundwater chemical analyses groundwater samples were taken after each borehole was purged to ensure that the sample was representative of aquifer conditions samples were collected in polyethylene bottles previously washed with distilled water and they were refrigerated until analysis in ianigla cct conicet mendoza laboratories groundwater samplings were obtained every three to four months from november 2011 to june 2016 five sampling periods in these samples we measured ph electric conductivity ec in situ and chloride cl concentrations in the laboratory with selective electrodes using a multiparametric meter thermo scientific orion nitrate no3 and phosphate po4 3 concentrations were determined with a cadmium reduction with nitraver5 pillows hach company 2007 and molybdenum blue methods murphy and riley 1962 respectively using a spectrophotometer hach dr 2800 hach loveland usa additional samples were collected from all boreholes and domestic wells of each livestock station for ionic composition in june 2014 in domestic wells groundwater is freely exposed to the atmospheric conditions and to inputs of sediments from the surface in these samples we determined major anions so4 2 co3 2 hco3 cl and cations na k ca2 mg2 co3 2 hco3 ca2 mg2 na and k were analyzed following standard methods of american public health association apha et al 1995 with volumetric methods for co3 2 hco3 ca2 mg2 and spectrometric flame method for na and k metrolab 315 flame photometer so4 2

multiparametric meter thermo scientific orion star 2 6 groundwater isotopic analyses we sampled groundwater from all boreholes at two to three times in three consecutive growth periods covering the spring summer and fall winter seasons from 2013 to 2016 groundwater samples were collected into 15 ml falcon tubes which were sealed with parafilm immediately after sampling to avoid evaporation and placed in a cooler in the field the tubes were stored in the refrigerator until isotopic determination stable isotope analyses were conducted at the laboratory of grupo de estudios ambientales imasl

precision vaporizer overall analytical precision of the spectrometer was estimated at 0 5 and 0 1 for δ2h and δ18o respectively stable isotope data were expressed in delta notation relative to vienna standard mean ocean water v smow and to an internal laboratory standard mendoza river water calibrated against international reference materials δ is defined as eq 1 1 δ rsample rstandard 1 1000 where rsample and rstandard are 2h 1h or 18o 16o 2 7 statistical analysis we made descriptive comparisons of groundwater fluctuations for control woodlands and livestock stations determining periods of rising and falling levels based on manual measurements of groundwater depths and continuous records provided by pressure transducers from september 2014 to september 2017 in order to analyze differences in groundwater level changes between both disturbance conditions we i made visual interpretation of the patterns of each temporal series and fitted a smooth function to this general trend using generalized additive models the optimal spline can be found using the generalized cross validation criterion ii discounted the relative changes in groundwater depths obtained from livestock station minus those obtained from control woodland at exactly the same time and iii calculated the groundwater daily change rate i e slope from one day to the next one cm d 1 of each temporal series then we compared the groundwater daily change rate of the control woodland and livestock stations by using the mann whitney u analysis this non parametric test was used because the distribution of data was not normal a significance level of 0 01 was determined to assume statistical differences chemical characteristics of groundwater were plotted on piper diagrams piper 1944 then we assessed the effects of disturbance condition d season s and sampling period p on groundwater chemistry using linear mixed models lmms we fitted models considering disturbance condition control woodland vs livestock station season spring summer vs fall winter and sampling periods five levels as fixed factors and paired sites as a random factor with regressive autocorrelation variance structure corar1 classical linear models assume an equal variance of errors however it is possible to model heteroscedasticity in lmms from variance functions to relax the homoscedasticity assumption oddi et al 2020 hence we considered the heteroscedasticity in each lmm by modeling the variance structure weight varident form 1 site then all combinations of fixed factors with their interactions were assessed and ranked using the akaike information criterion aic the selection of the best models and parameter estimation was performed by the inference of multiple models with the dredge function from package mumin barton 2019 the models that were within four aic of the lowest value were retained to obtain parameter estimates and their confidences intervals we used akaike weights w to generate weighted estimate burnham and anderson 2002 the statistical analyses were carried out using the r statistical environment r development core team 2019 we assessed the effects of disturbance condition season and sampling period three periods on natural abundance of hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes in groundwater using linear mixed models following the same statistical analysis described for the chemical variables in addition the stable isotopic composition of groundwater samples was compared with the global meteoric water line craig 1961 the local evaporation line gomez et al 2014 and the local rainfall and river water samples obtained from previous studies jobbágy et al 2011 3 results 3 1 groundwater fluctuations groundwater levels in the livestock station remained above those of the control woodland with a time series that tends to separate in time we observed a seasonal pattern in both time series with spring summer declines and fall winter rises fig 3 a as shown in this figure the fitted trend in groundwater levels can be plotted as a smooth function of time using a gams for each land use appendix table a1 for details of the fitted gams moreover the spring summer decline was interrupted by precipitation pulses with groundwater levels rising or remaining constant in both disturbance conditions the livestock station temporal series presented higher values than the control woodland for the whole period explored while the control woodland presented higher seasonal variation differences between minimum and maximum values than the livestock station fig 3a level differences indicated that throughout the whole period the disturbed site had an overall rise with differences increasing in the fall winter seasons fig 3b groundwater daily change rates presented differences between the two land uses fig 3c the control woodland displayed higher daily changes than the livestock station p 0 01 although the differences of the daily changes were found through the time series they became particularly higher at the end of the dry seasons where the air temperature was increasing but precipitation had not started yet fig 2 3 2 chemical composition the groundwater chemistry can be explored by plotting major cation and anion concentrations on a piper trilinear diagram the order of cation dominance was na ca2 mg2 k and the order of anions was so4 2 cl hco3 for anions in both land uses na so4 cl was the predominant groundwater type fig 4 variations in groundwater chemical composition depended on the disturbance condition season and sampling period thus candidate models those with daic 4 included all combinations of fixed factors with their interactions table 2 the ph values were neutral to alkaline ranging from 6 5 to 8 2 in both disturbance conditions over time fig 5 a the best model for ph included all interactions among the main explaining factors consequently groundwater ph was determined by the integration of land use season and sampling period electrical conductivity was always higher in livestock stations than in control woodlands and varied according to the seasons and sampling periods the top ranked models with daic 4 included the three main explaining factors and the interaction between disturbance condition and season fig 5b cl concentrations were also higher in livestock stations 375 mg l on average than in control woodlands in the 2014 2015 period cl concentrations increased with respect to other sampling periods in both disturbance conditions from lmms differences in cl between land uses were kept relatively constant during sampling periods fig 5c no3 concentrations differed between the two disturbance conditions with higher values in livestock stations moreover in control woodlands the average no3 concentrations were constant at 3 mg l over time while in livestock stations they decreased from to 19 mg l to 4 mg l fig 5d so models that included interactive effects among disturbance condition season and sampling period had lower aic and maximum weight waic of the model set considered po4 3 concentrations were higher in livestock stations with differences increasing in recent sampling periods fig 5e several candidate models had similar empirical support to explain the changes of groundwater po4 3 table 2 in the supplementary data we shown the parameter estimates for each chemical variable appendix table a2 3 3 isotope composition over time groundwater in livestock stations was slightly enriched in heavier isotopes δ2h and δ18o compared to control woodlands we also found changes in isotope composition that depended on the sampling period with differences between both disturbance conditions that tended to decrease over time in control woodlands δ18o and δ2h values ranged from a minimum of 18 48 and 138 8 in winter 2014 to maximum of 16 46 and 127 9 in summer 2013 respectively in contrast in livestock stations δ18o and δ2h values ranged from a minimum of 17 82 and 135 1 in winter 2016 to a maximum of 13 48 and 113 0 in summer 2013 respectively fig 6 a and fig 6b as a result the best models for both water isotopes were those that included the interaction between all fixed effects table 2 in the supplementary data we show the parameter estimates for each isotopic variable appendix table a3 for comparative purposes in fig 6c we included samples of soil water summer rainfall and mendoza river water using data from a previous study we found that isotopic compositions of groundwater in both disturbance conditions were close to the signature of mendoza river water and distinct from local rainfalls however groundwater samples in livestock stations showed isotopic composition with some degree of evaporative enrichment as occurred in isotopic profiles in vegetated lowlands indicating isolated rainfall fed zones soil water in bare lowlands was isotopically similar to rainfall fig 6c 4 discussion the comparison of groundwater levels and chemistry under disturbed and undisturbed woodlands in the monte desert indicate different influences of disturbances on the hydrological and chemical processes of the aquifer the partial removal of vegetation and intense grazing in livestock settlements had consequences on groundwater dynamics at different temporal scales at the inter annual scale groundwater depths tended to decrease slightly from 2014 to 2017 in the control woodland while remained relatively stable in livestock station fig 3 such differences were related to earlier recovery during the winter level in disturbed sites in the livestock station the fall of the groundwater level was not so marked compared to the control woodland probably due to lower consumption of groundwater by phreatophytes lower plant cover table 1 variations in groundwater depths could have site dependent responses where multiple factors determine the dynamics of changes for example the number of phreatophytes in space density the size of the trees height root depth and the use of water according to physiological needs and meteorological conditions determine an integrated response for each site that affects water table fluctuations at the seasonal scale groundwater depth fluctuations occurred in response to vegetation activity shifts determining spring summer declines and fall winter rises of water table levels fig 3a such seasonal variations sustain the hypothesis that phreatophytes their leaf phenology and meteorological conditions strongly influence groundwater fluctuations p flexuosa the main species coupled to groundwater is a deciduous tree that loses their leaves in winter alvarez and villagra 2009 in coincidence with groundwater level recovery our results agree with aforementioned studies showing that lowlands are groundwater discharging areas contreras et al 2011 jobbágy et al 2011 however these seasonal fluctuations were more intense in control woodlands than in livestock stations on a time scale of days to a week the main controls over the use of groundwater by phreatophyte vegetation are variations in meteorological conditions such as irradiance air temperature atmospheric humidity vapor pressure deficit and wind which determine the rates of evapotranspiration butler et al 2007 loheide et al 2005 phreatophytic vegetation transpires during the daytime groundwater consumption and discharge decreasing groundwater depths similarly during the night the phreatic level recovers due to the net income given by horizontal water movement dzikiti et al 2013 jobbágy and jackson 2004 loheide et al 2005 orellana et al 2012 white 1932 previous comparisons of p flexuosa ecophysiological responses in the same sites indicated that the trees remaining in livestock stations appear to grow under a less stressful environment improved water and nutritional status with more soil resources meglioli et al 2016 the phreatophyte control on groundwater dynamics was likely relaxing in livestock stations determining a lower groundwater consumption by p flexuosa at a fine time scale we detected that the seasonal pattern of decline that occurs during the vegetative growth season spring summer was interrupted by rainfall events as a result after precipitation events the phreatic fall was delayed in both land use conditions these results suggest a partial decoupling of phreatophytes from the aquifer due to the availability of soil surface water and they support previous studies that indicate p flexuosa ability to respond to unpredictable pulses of water availability debandi et al 2020 guevara et al 2010 in control woodlands the rise in groundwater levels although lower than in livestock station for the rainy period could be attributed to the indirect effects of rainfall on the aquifer due to a reduction in groundwater consumption by the phreatophyte vegetation that is compensated by increased absorption of rainwater from the surface soil our data suggest that multiple plants in the interdune valleys of our study sites use groundwater through their deep root systems such as p flexuosa p alpataco geoffroea decorticans atamisquea emarginata alvarez and villagra 2009 jobbágy et al 2011 vega riveros et al 2011 villagra et al 2011 recent studies based on the analysis of soil profiles indicate that livestock stations function as foci of local recharge meglioli et al 2014 by integrating the piezometric records chloride soil profiles stable isotope composition of groundwater and precipitation the hydrological dynamics of the monte desert could be discussed with different methodological approaches the stable isotopes of groundwater in both disturbance conditions were congruent with those previously reported for the study area which determined that groundwater is isotopically lighter than summer rainfalls the isotopic signature of the groundwater was close to the water of the mendoza river aranibar et al 2011 gomez et al 2014 jobbágy et al 2011 indicating that remote aquifer recharge processes are predominant in the contributions of water however slightly more isotopically enriched groundwater was found in livestock stations than in control woodlands with differences decreasing over time fig 6 these relative changes between undisturbed and disturbed conditions of woodlands have been caused by local recharge which mix groundwater with summer rainwater in livestock stations as suggested by isotopic and biochemical evidences in this study livestock stations showed changes in groundwater chemistry presenting higher electrical conductivity cl no3 and po4 3 concentrations in groundwater fig 5 these increases could be caused by indirect effects of livestock goats and cows which capture and transport nutrients from a broad grazing range and deposit excrement and urine into highly disturbed sites pastoralist settlements providing solutes and nutrients to the soils meglioli et al 2017 according to previous studies livestock stations indicate increased water infiltration and mobilization of salts and no3 from the surface soils to the aquifer i e local groundwater recharge in contrast control woodlands show no evidence of vertical flow of water and solutes jobbágy et al 2011 meglioli et al 2014 cl concentrations which indicate a recharge regime in deserts and are inversely proportional to downstream water flow herczeg and leaney 2011 phillips 1994 scanlon 1991 were higher in groundwater samples of livestock stations than in control woodlands representing evidence of increased vertical water flow in disturbed sites fig 5b we also found higher no3 and po4 3 concentrations in groundwater samples from livestock stations than in control woodlands although it tended to decrease over time for nitrate fig 5 rainwater percolates to deeper layers diluting the salts and leaching nutrients accumulated in the soil until reaching the aquifer stadler et al 2008 no3 ions have higher mobility compared to po4 3 rivett et al 2008 having higher potential flows during rainy events livestock stations increased no3 concentrations and five samples exceeded the maximum limit established for human consumption at the beginning of the sampling period código alimentario argentino 2007 deteriorating the quality of this water resource in the rainy period 2015 2016 of high intensity and frequent rainy pulses the increase of no3 in groundwater were not detected as expected even in the following months interestingly when cl reached their maximum peak in this rainy period no3 decreased to their minimum values in livestock stations this supports the idea that at livestock stations previous local recharges diluted cl and recharged no3 the accumulated rainfall in the soil profile its storage and subsequent drainage present a delay in time that does not allow a response to be visualized in the short term the horizontal movement of groundwater in the telteca aquifer with a regional velocity estimated between 0 1 and 0 25 m day aranibar et al 2011 could contribute to the dilution of the no3 content over time in the event that the velocity exceeds the no3 inputs into the aquifer by downward flow solutes can be transported via the groundwater to other areas of natural woodlands following the southwest northeast flow direction determined for the study area gomez et al 2014 in conclusion in this study it was possible to reconstruct free aquifer level dynamics and its relationship with local rainfall in undisturbed and disturbed woodlands of the monte desert several factors can influence aquifer recharge discharge processes and consequently the hydrology dynamics including topography type and cover of vegetation soil characteristics e g type of sediments depths of the aquifer local precipitation land use anthropogenic activities and climate change banks et al 2011 butler et al 2007 giménez et al 2016 newman et al 2006 we found that both disturbance conditions maintained similar fluctuations in groundwater levels throughout the years with declines progressing during spring summer and a recovery during fall and winter however small differences between both land uses during rainfall pulses suggests that groundwater in livestock stations is more sensitive to precipitation than in control woodlands it would be interesting to confirm these results with longer time periods and higher number of phreatimeters in desert ecosystems there are still few records of groundwater level fluctuations and groundwater quality kim and jackson 2012 taylor et al 2013 the partial removal of vegetation and intense grazing in livestock settlements produce changes on groundwater chemistry and alter the quality of this water reservoir the cl and isotopic results provide evidence of higher transport of rain water and solutes from the surface and vadose zone into the groundwater suggesting increasing local recharge and no3 leaching in livestock stations this study helps us to better understand the influence of phreatophyte woodlands and the effects of land use change on groundwater dynamics in the coming years more efforts are needed to continue monitoring groundwater which is a key resource

4539,for about two decades neural networks are widely used for river temperature modelling however in recent years one has to distinguish between the classical shallow neural networks and deep learning networks the applicability of rapidly developing deep learning networks to stream water temperature modelling may be limited but some methods developed for deep learning if properly re considered may efficiently improve performance of shallow networks dropout is widely considered the method that allows deep learning networks to avoid overfitting to training data facilitating its implementations to versatile problems recently the successful applicability of dropout for river temperature modelling by means of shallow multilayer perceptron neural networks has been introduced in the present study we propose to use dropout solely for input neurons of product unit neural networks for the purpose of stream temperature modelling we perform tests on data collected from six catchments located in temperate climate zones on two continents in various orographic conditions we show that the average performance of product unit neural networks trained with input dropout is better than the average performance of product units without dropout product units with dropout applied to every layer of the networks multilayer perceptron neural networks with or without dropout and the semi physical air2stream model the advantage of product unit neural networks with input dropout is statistically significant on hilly or mountainous catchments the performance on flat ones is similar to the performances obtained from competitive models keywords product unit neural networks shallow artificial neural networks dropout water temperature modelling in rivers 1 introduction water temperature in rivers plays a crucial role for both aquatic biota webb et al 2008 patrick et al 2019 and human activities in the catchment van vliet et al 2013 behrens et al 2017 climatic changes have already affected the water temperatures in various rivers in the world especially in temperate or cold climatic zones orr et al 2015 paul et al 2019 modelling water temperature in streams is important to understand and anticipate the possible future of particular aquatic systems the modelling of stream temperature is often performed either by means of physically based dugdale et al 2017 semi physical models toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 or by data based methods benyahya et al 2007 each of these approaches has some advantages and disadvantages due to the often limited information on various environmental factors users frequently focus on data based models that often rely on a limited number of relatively easily obtained variables even though such models are rather doubtful for extrapolation beyond the ranges found within the calibration data among data based models artificial neural networks ann haykin 1999 goodfellow et al 2016 are probably the most widely used for stream temperature modelling chenard and caissie 2008 sahoo et al 2009 jeong et al 2013 cole et al 2014 hadzima nyarko et al 2014 piotrowski et al 2015 shi et al 2018 liu et al 2018 zhu et al 2019 rajaee et al 2020 although ann models have been applied to hydrological and atmospheric problems for over a quarter century abrahart et al 2012 cabaneros et al 2019 in recent few years a boom of deep learning methods has re gained wide interest in neural networks shen et al 2018 rasp et al 2018 nonetheless due to the huge number of parameters in deep learning networks lecun et al 2015 and numerous unsolved methodological difficulties lathuillere et al 2019 including vulnerability to so called adversarial examples carlini and wagner 2017 su et al 2019 their possible applicability for regression problems that rely on uncertain environmental data is yet to be shown zhu et al 2020a however even if deep learning networks would be too large for a specific hydro meteorological task some methods developed for deep learning methods may be worth implementing into simpler models krapu et al 2019 piotrowski et al 2020 in addition some deep learning models may be successfully used as single layered ones kratzert et al 2019 it is widely known that anns are universal approximators hornik et al 1989 and may suffer from the problem of overfitting geman et al 1992 haykin 1999 e g during training their parameters may fit not only to the signal that represents some property of the environment but also to the noise present in the training data sample although there are plenty of methods to cope with overfitting in shallow neural networks haykin 1999 liu et al 2008 see piotrowski and napiorkowski 2013 for comparison on water related problem with various rates of success dropout hinton et al 2012 srivastava et al 2014 is believed to be the novel approach that allowed deep learning methods to limit the impact of overfitting and work efficiently for numerous problems the dropout method is very simple during a network s training at each iteration for every training sample vector of input variables a randomly determined fraction of nodes is dropped out this is often implemented as multiplying outgoing signals from each node by 0 or 1 when 0 is chosen with probability 1 dp and 1 otherwise srivastava et al 2014 defined dp as the probability of retaining nodes in their paper and we follow this definition in the present study as a result only the shortened version of the network is trained in a particular iteration on the particular training pattern note that the removing of nodes is temporary and done for each iteration and training sample separately the final network contains all nodes hence after training all weights are to be multiplied by dp srivastava et al 2014 to compensate for processing the signals by the larger network the aim of dropout is to reduce the impact of single nodes on the performance of the whole network and to avoid overfitting to the noise present in the training sample reviews of dropout methodology and its numerous variants may be found in labach et al 2019 and piotrowski et al 2020 dropout is claimed to be suited not only for deep but also for shallow neural networks baldi and sadowski 2014 mianjy et al 2018 recently we have shown piotrowski et al 2020 that dropout and its variant dropconnect wan et al 2013 in which each connection between nodes may be dropped out instead of the full nodes do help in improving the performance of multilayer perceptron networks mlp for stream temperature simulations if the probability of retaining nodes dp is large i e only about 1 of nodes are dropped out dropping out about 1 of nodes during training improves the performance of shallow networks in two ways 1 it is high enough to prevent some nodes from having too large an impact on the final results and simultaneously it is small enough to avoid much disturbance to the model s training a shallow network has dozens or hundreds of nodes not thousands or millions as is the case for deep learning 2 by temporarily setting some of the network s parameters to 0 the problem dimensionality is reduced and hence the fitness landscape of the objective function malan and engelbrecht 2013 soltanolkotabi et al 2019 allowing the gradient based algorithm to leave local optima various metaheuristics may also be used for the neural network s training but their performance and speed is subject to an ongoing debate see piotrowski and napiorkowski 2011 ojha et al 2017 li et al 2019 although metaheuristics are often considered to be global search optimizers they are also prone to premature convergence see pandey et al 2014 and hence they may also benefit from a temporal reduction of problem dimensionality in the present paper we introduce dropout and dropconnect methods into other kinds of shallow networks namely product unit neural networks punn durbin and rumelhart 1989 due to the special features of punn we also propose using dropout for punn input variables only solely dropping out input nodes may be advantageous for product unit networks as it still allows both goals given above to be achieved but with a more limited disturbance to the model in which inputs are raised to the powers that are calibrated model parameters weights we compare the results obtained by punn with dropout dropconnect and input dropout against the results obtained by punn without dropout to present the results in a broader context we validate the performance of punn with various versions of dropout against mlp networks with and without dropout and by the popular semi physical air2stream model toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 considering the recent wide applicability of shallow neural networks in hydrology oceanology and atmospheric sciences crawford et al 2019 bergen et al 2019 berkhahn et al 2019 kulp and strauss 2019 sezen et al 2019 flombaum et al 2020 jia et al 2020 diez sierra and del jesus 2020 nourani et al 2020 mewes et al 2020 snieder et al 2020 we hope the proposed method may be beneficial not only for stream temperature modelling but possibly also other hydrological applications 2 catchments data sets and model input variables our research aims at modelling small to medium sized gauged catchments located in temperate climatic zones we aim at testing catchments with very different orographic conditions from high mountains to flat plains and with the diversified impact of snowy and winter conditions considering data availability we have chosen six catchments from the northern usa poland and switzerland located between 43 n and 54 n see a map in fig 1 the brief description of each catchment and data series used in this study is given in table 1 we aim at modelling stream temperature at a given cross section hence a daily stream temperature t t s is the output from the model where t is an index of the day the following variables are used as model inputs air temperature t t a from a number lag of recent days a single value per catchment for each day is used the discharge q t from the recent day observed at the same cross section as the stream temperature the declination of the sun calculated for every day of the year d s t and the difference in declination of the sun from two recent days ddst declination of the sun and difference in the declination at two consecutive days are important as these variables are the simplest substitutes for solar radiation and hence they improve the performance of stream temperature data driven models without any cost piotrowski and napiorkowski 2015 the precise number of data available for each catchment vary see table 1 but is not shorter than nine years of daily measurements in the case of five catchments air temperature measured at a single location within a catchment is used as t t a only in the case of the biala tarnowska catchment are five series of air temperatures measured at different locations used and catchment averaged air temperature is obtained for this catchment by means of the thiessen polygons method thiessen and alter 1911 the percentage values associated with each meteorological station in the biala tarnowska catchment are given in table 1 for each catchment the data are chronologically divided into the set used for calibration and the set used for independent testing of optimized neural networks specific periods are given in table 1 the first 2 3 of daily data from the calibration set is applied for training i e are used to compute objective function values during calibration and the remaining 1 3 of the data from the calibration set are used for validation i e to choose the optimal solution after the training algorithm terminates the testing set is not used during the calibration process at all and is composed of between 33 and 38 of available data as this study uses neural networks to obtain a modelled value of stream temperature for the particular day t t sm which means temperature of stream modelled for day t input variables must be adequately pre processed for each t th time step we create a vector composed of inputs xt that include observations of air temperature t t i 1 a from the pre specified number of lag previous days i 1 lag discharge from the recent day q t declination of the sun d s t and the difference in declinations of the sun in two recent days stream temperatures from recent days are not used as input variables for modelling future stream temperatures as we expect models to be applicable to future climatic conditions as it is not possible to know a priori how many recent air temperatures should be considered we test lag values from 1 to 18 hence the total number of input variables is in l a g 3 including q t d s t and d s t d s t 1 3 product unit neural networks with dropout in 1989 durbin and rumelhart 1989 proposed so called product unit anns punn which has both summation and product nodes in punn each input variable is raised to the power that is the network s parameter the values of these power weights are optimized during training if an input is negative and particular weight w kj between k th input and i th node is a non integer output would be a complex number which may lead to unphysical water temperature values as we cannot force values of w kj to be integers punn input variables need to be scaled to some positive interval martinez estudillo et al 2006 for example by 1 x k t 0 1 0 8 x k t x maxk x maxk x mink where xmaxk and xmink are the maximum and the minimum values in the whole data set of k th input variable the simplest version of punn introduced by durbin and rumelhart 1989 may be defined as follows 2 t t s f v 0 j 1 hn v j k 1 in x k t w kj where in and hn are the numbers of input and hidden nodes v and w are matrixes of parameters weights that are to be calibrated f is the activation function x t is the vector of scaled input variables and t t s is the output from punn that is then re scaled 3 t t sm t min s t max s t min s t t s 0 1 0 8 to obtain the modelled stream temperature t t sm in this study we consider only the simplest case with f being the identity function martinez estudillo et al 2006 piotrowski and napiorkowski 2012 hence eq 2 may be simplified to 4 t t s v 0 j 1 hn v j k 1 in x k t w kj we introduce classical bernoulli dropout srivastava et al 2014 into punn by multiplying all weights both the summation v and product w ones by binary matrix d in hn tr that is randomly regenerated in every iteration such that each element is set to 1 with probability dp and to 0 otherwise in d matrix in hn is the sum of nodes in input and hidden layers and tr is the number of patterns in training and validation data sets matrix d must be generated anew in each iteration as its role is not to skip permanently some connections within punn what would happen if the same d were used during the whole training but to avoid the case when some weights or input data gains too much impact on the final performance of the model the resulting punn with dropout is as follows 5 t t s v 0 j 1 hn v j d in j t k 1 in x k t d k t w kj after training the values of the neural network s parameters are to be multiplied by dp hence decreased as dp 1 to compensate for the fact that they were achieved with training on shortened variants of the final network srivastava et al 2014 and the final values of modelling criteria are evaluated for such an updated network in a similar way dropconnect wan et al 2013 a variant of dropout in which specific links between nodes are to be skipped instead of the whole nodes is introduced into punn in dropconnect d1 in hn tr binary matrix is used for all connections between input and hidden nodes and d2 hn tr binary matrix is used for connections between the hidden nodes and the single output hence when applying dropconnect into punn one obtains 6 t t s v 0 j 1 hn d 2 j t v j k 1 in x k t d 1 kj t w kj again after training all parameters are multiplied by dp as may be seen punn training with dropconnect will be more randomized than that with basic dropout so much randomness turned out to be advantageous for training the mlp that only has summation nodes piotrowski et al 2020 but may not be as useful for punn with product nodes hence for punn we also propose a third approach namely using dropout for input nodes only in such a case a single binary matrix d in tr is used as follows 7 t t s v 0 j 1 hn v j k 1 in x k t d k t w kj after training w parameters are multiplied by dp but v ones are not for each variant of dropout for punn the proper probability of retaining nodes dp needs to be found in the initial studies on deep learning networks hinton et al 2012 srivastava et al 2014 this value was set to about 0 5 which means that on average half of the nodes were dropped out in each case since then very different dp values were used in deep learning literature ranging from 0 1 trajanovski et al 2018 to 0 95 or even 1 depending on the network s layer fan et al 2017 in our previous study piotrowski et al 2020 we found that for shallow mlp networks applied to stream temperature modelling high values of the probability of retaining nodes dp close to 0 98 0 995 perform best lower values turned out to be harmful for shallow networks as they imply too much disturbance during training and prevent convergence to verify the choice for punn in this study dp values of 0 5 0 9 0 95 0 98 0 99 0 995 and 1 the last one means no dropout are tested all versions of punn eqs 4 7 in this study are trained with the classical second order gradient based levenberg marquardt algorithm lm hagan and menhaj 1994 that was widely used for neural networks in the past adamowski and karapataki 2010 graf et al 2019 zhu et al 2020b as required by the lm algorithm the objective function to be minimized during calibration is the mean square error mse 8 mse 1 n t 1 n t t sm t t s 2 here n is the number of data samples in the particular data set the maximum number of iterations of lm algorithm is set to 400 derivatives are numerically approximated during lm training during punn training a classical early stopping approach prechlet et al 1998 is applied to avoid overfitting irrespectively of whether dropout is used or not the calibration data are divided into two sub sets a training one that includes the first 2 3 of measurements from the calibration set chronologically and a validation one that includes the rest of the data from the calibration set during training moves of the lm algorithm are based only on derivatives and objective function values mse computed for the training data set after training the solution with the lowest mse value for the validation data is chosen it is very difficult to define a priori the proper architecture of a neural network for the specific task and data hence we consider all possible configurations of punn architectures with up to 18 lags hence up to 21 input variables and up to 12 hidden nodes this is computationally expensive but allows insight into the relationship between the complexity of punn architecture and the efficiency of both dropout variant and dp probability for each variant of punn eqs 4 7 for every catchment considered for each probability of retaining nodes dp and for each punn architecture the training is repeated 50 times starting from different randomly generated points in the solution space this provides us with a sample of results and hence makes the conclusions on usefulness of a particular methodology meaningful the best punn architecture for each catchment and the best variant of dropout is chosen according to the mean mse from 50 runs however this choice is made twice once based on mean mse from 50 runs obtained for the training data set the second time for the validation data set that enables us to verify the impact of specific periods from which training or validation data were collected on the final choice of the network s architecture or dp note that each time we compare the performance of architectures based on numerous runs not a single realization 4 multilayer perceptron neural networks with dropout multilayer perceptron neural networks mlp haykin 1999 are used in this study as a competitive method against punn to provide a fair comparison we use mlp with dropconnect and dp 0 99 as recommended in piotrowski et al 2020 and without dropout which is equivalent to dp 1 for mlp among various possible options the input variables were chosen to be scaled to a 0 1 interval by 9 x k t x k t x mink x maxk x mink where xmaxk and xmink are the maximum and the minimum values in the whole data set of k th input variable respectively we use linear activation functions in input and output layers and logistic activation function in hidden layer such mlp with dropconnect may be represented as follows 10 t t s v 0 j 1 hn d 2 j t v j 1 exp w j 0 k 1 in d 1 kj t w kj x k t in eq 10 we use the same notation as in eq 6 the modelled output is re scaled as 11 t t sm t min s t t s t max s t min s to keep the methodological parts of mlp identical with punn we use the same lm training algorithm the same early stopping method number of computations and identical division of data into training validation and testing sets as in punn we also test mlp architectures with numbers of input from 4 to 21 hence lag values from 1 to 18 and hidden nodes from 1 to 12 identical as in punn the same criteria of choosing the best mlp architectures are applied as in the case of punn 5 semi physically based air2stream model for broader validation of the results obtained by punn the semi physical air2stream model toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 is also used as a competitive method air2stream is based on a lumped heat budget that takes into account an unknown volume of water in the particular river its tributaries groundwater and heat exchange with an atmosphere by the following equation 12 ρ c p v d t w dt a h ρ c p i q i t w i q t w where v is an unknown volume of water of river reach with surface area a and water temperature tw ρ is water density with specific heat capacity at constant pressure cp h is the net heat flux between air and water qi is the discharge from the i th water source either tributary or groundwater with water temperature tw i q is the discharge downstream of the insertion of tributaries and t is time as discussed in toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 after parameterization of different variables from eq 12 the following version of air2stream with 8 parameters a1 a8 may be obtained 13 d t w dt 1 θ a 4 a 1 a 2 t a a 3 t w θ a 5 a 6 cos 2 π t t y a 7 a 8 t w θ q q q t 2 t 1 1 t 1 t 2 q t d t in eq 13 ta represents air temperature ty length of the year in days θ dimensionless streamflow and q mean discharge during the whole calibration data t1 to t2 denote the first and the last days of the calibration set the 4th order runge kutta method is used to solve eq 13 using water temperature from the first available day as the initial condition if some negative stream temperatures do appear during modelling by means of air2stream they are set to 0 c air2stream is calibrated 30 times for each catchment with the cobide wang et al 2014 algorithm as in piotrowski and napiorkowski 2018 note that when comparing ann models with air2stream one cannot avoid some clear differences that come up as a consequence of the use of very different kinds of models firstly for air2stream only measurements of air temperature and discharge are used contrary to anns that may use any numerical inputs using other variables is not possible for air2stream that has physical roots at least without developing a much different model secondly air2stream in the form presented in eq 13 requires information on the initial condition for each catchment to limit the impact of the initial condition on the modelling in this paper tw values simulated for the first 30 days are not used to evaluate model performance for calibration data thirdly air2stream does not need the training and validation data to be divided into subsets as it is not a universal approximator as a result its parameters are directly fitted to a larger number of data the whole calibration set in addition the air2stream model is calibrated 30 times for each catchment with the cobide wang et al 2014 evolutionary algorithm as in piotrowski and napiorkowski 2018 because the lm algorithm is not suitable for this task despite these differences the final comparison between the punn mlp and air2stream models is based on testing of the data sets which are of course identical for each model and are fully independent of the calibration procedures 6 results in this section we first analyze the impact of various dropout variants on the performance of punn instead of focusing on a specific punn architecture we discuss a broader picture and analyze all combinations of architectures within some limit to see how the impact of dropout variants is affected by increasing the complexity of the punn models to facilitate comparison amongst different kinds of modelling tools two additional approaches will be used firstly the best punn architectures and dropout variants will be chosen and their performance discussed against mlp networks and air2stream models secondly the models with the same subjectively chosen and fixed architecture with hn 10 and log 15 will be compared obviously the choice of architecture is made for punn and mlp but not for the air2stream model in figs 2 7 we show the relationship between the mean mse achieved by punn trained with a particular dropout variant against the number of hidden nodes hn used and the number of lag days lag from which the air temperature is applied as inputs note that the total number of input variables to punn equals lag 3 3 additional inputs are declination of the sun difference in two recent declinations of the sun and discharge from the most recent day only results obtained for testing data are illustrated in figs 2 7 in each figs 2 7 we show ten 3 dimensional plots for 3 dropout variants dropconnect classical dropout and input dropout and 3 probabilities of retaining nodes dp set to 0 9 0 99 and 0 998 the tenth bottom plot illustrates the results for punn without dropout what is equivalent to dp 1 which should be considered as a reference point in the further discussion to save space in this part of the discussion we skip other dp values tested but a brief glimpse at figs 2 7 convinces us that each dropout variant with dp 0 9 leads to much poorer results than those with dp 0 99 or 0 998 making illustrations with lower dp values e g 0 5 of marginal importance to focus on meaningful differences between the best performing punn architectures and dp probabilities for each catchment on figs 2 7 we truncate results with mse higher than some pre specified value e g 1 2 for the biala tarnowska river 0 3 for the dischmabach 0 55 for the fanno creek 1 for the irondequoit creek 0 8 for the cedar river and 1 8 for the suprasl river architectures with higher mean mse are shown simply as hitting this ceiling the truncation values are chosen subjectively for each catchment as mse values obtained for each catchment do differ such that variability of performance among model architectures that lead to meaningful results would be easily spotted on figures truncation values have no other meaning than to facilitate illustration of the main findings how the performances of punn with different dropout variants and probabilities are related with punn architectures without truncation values the results with very poor performances would dominate the illustrative plots hampering discussion from figs 2 7 we clearly see that when the probability of retaining nodes dp equals 0 9 the performance of almost all tested punn architectures is poorer than the assumed illustrative threshold for each river irrespective of which variant of dropout is considered obtained results with dp 0 9 or lower are much worse than the results achieved without dropout this may be noted by comparing the first row of plots against the lowest plot on each figure and explained as follows when dropping out on average 10 of the shallow network s nodes during training dp 0 9 too much randomness is introduced into the gradients computed by the calibration algorithm at a particular iteration and instead of reaching some local optimum it performs in chaotic steps if dropout of nodes occurs more rarely dp 0 99 or 0 998 the performance of punn with all three considered dropout variants is much better than when dp 0 9 was used see second and third row of plots on figs 2 7 with a low dp value in a particular iteration the work of a particular node is only affected for a very limited number of data pairs hence the algorithm generally follows the right direction but with some slight disturbance as a result it may get out of the local optima as dropping out a node modifies the fitness landscape and avoids falling into local solution nonetheless the classical dropout and dropconnect are de facto unable to improve results obtained by punn without dropout on four out of six catchments even when dp 0 99 or 0 998 the only two cases where classical dropout or dropconnect are justified are polish catchments the mountainous biala tarnowska and more noticeably the flat suprasl improving 2 out of 6 cases is not enough to recommend this particular approach as a result contrary to mlp networks see piotrowski et al 2020 the classical dropout or dropconnect may barely be useful for shallow punn models with product nodes if dropout is implemented to input nodes only see the plots in the right column of figs 2 7 the picture is much different in the case of all catchments the performance of punn architectures with input dropout and dp 0 99 or 0 998 is better than the performance of punn without dropout with the exception of the suprasl catchment the results obtained by punn with input dropout are also much better than those obtained by punn with classical dropout or dropconnect it is important to relate the performance of punn with input dropout to the network s architecture input dropout is especially efficient when the number of input and hidden nodes is larger however its positive impact on the punn results is often noted even when lag and hn are relatively low e g 5 6 note that it does not necessarily mean that the more nodes that are used the better the performance of punn too few nodes clearly make input dropout ineffective however when the number of input or hidden nodes become higher and higher the performance of punn with input dropout may improve until some limit and then start to deteriorate note that we discuss results obtained for testing data here that are independent of the calibration process for example on the fanno creek when lag exceeds 7 a decreasing performance of punn with input dropout is observed irrespective of the number of hidden nodes a similar decrease in performance of punn with input dropout is seen on the cedar creek when the number of hidden nodes exceeds 5 7 especially when lag is high hence the use of input dropout does not favour bigger networks rather it simply does not work for very small ones results obtained by punn input dropout indicate that rare dropping out inputs facilitate escaping shallow local optima and equally spread the processed information among the majority of nodes however too frequent dropout or dropping out connections between product and summation nodes does not allow the training method to converge to an optimum of sufficient quality this finding is in agreement with results obtained for mlp piotrowski et al 2020 with respect to the desired probability of retaining nodes dp however it is in full contradiction with the results achieved by mlp with respect to the number of specific connections that may be dropped out in mlp the best choice was dropconnect which allows for dropping out of each specific connection between nodes in punn the only beneficial one is the simplified variant of dropout applied solely to the whole input nodes above we have discussed the illustrative findings for the whole spectrum of tested punn architectures that were based only on testing data however comparison against other models would be facilitated by finding the best architectures of punn coupled with each dropout variant and comparing the mean mse values obtained for these best configuration of input and hidden nodes such architectures will be compared against the best architectures found for mlp neural networks and against the air2stream model because all combinations of architectures within 1 12 hidden nodes and 1 18 lags are tested explicitly in this study the choice of the best punn architecture is directly based on the empirical results and is decided separately for each variant of dropout and each dp value we make the choice of the best punn architecture twice once according to the mean mse obtained for training data set and the second time according to the mean mse for the validation set this allows us verifying if the two architectures chosen according to the performance on different data are similar the chosen best architectures are defined by hn and lag and their averaged mse results for training validation and testing data sets are shown for each catchment separately in tables 2 7 let us mention here that although we focus on a specific architecture in this part of the discussion results are still based on numerous realizations trainings of the particular architecture accordingly in each tables 2 7 the results obtained by the best architectures of mlp with dropconnect and dp 0 99 as suggested in piotrowski et al 2020 and by the best architectures of mlp without dropout are given in the case of air2stream there is no need to divide results into training and validation sets as no cross validation is performed due to the fact that air2stream is a semi physically based model toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 not a universal approximator hornik et al 1989 inter comparison among the best punn architectures associated with different dropout variants and dp probabilities show similar results as those inferred from plots illustrating the general performances of different punn architectures to verify the statistical significance of the results a two sample kolmogorov smirnov test is performed between punn without dropout and each variant of punn with dropout and dp probability in table 8 the p values of cases when the differences are statistically significant and punn with dropout is a better approach are shown i e has lower mean mse on the testing data set than punn without dropout the cases when punn without dropout is statistically significantly better at α 0 05 are marked and no means that the difference between two concerned models is insignificant the basic dropout and dropconnect are for the vast majority of catchments inefficient choices for punn punn without dropout is a statistically significantly better choice than punn with dropout or dropconnect irrespective of the dp on four catchments the only catchment on which dropout and dropconnect with dp 0 98 outperform punn without dropout is the suprasl results on the biala tarnowska are inconclusive on the contrary the best punn architecture selected for input dropout with dp 0 998 is according to testing data sets always better than the best architecture chosen for punn without dropout and with the exception of the irondequoit creek and only when validation data are used for choosing the best architecture the biala tarnowska catchment differences are strongly significant see p values in table 8 while reducing the probability of retained nodes in input dropout the overall statistically significant improvement over the no dropout scenario is noted until dp 0 98 this confirms conclusions from the comparison performed across all considered punn architectures discussed above for independent testing data the best punn architectures with input dropout and dp 0 99 0 998 chosen according to either training or validation data do perform better than mlp or air2stream models from tables 2 7 this is noted for all catchments but the irondequoit creek for which an equal performance is obtained by the best punn architecture with input dropout and dp 0 998 and the best mlp architecture with dropconnect and dp 0 99 the differences between the best punn architecture with input dropout and dp 0 998 and the best mlp architecture with dropconnect and dp 0 99 are statistically significant in 10 out of 12 comparisons six catchments and two ways of choosing the best architecture as depicted in table 9 among these 10 significant differences only in the irondequoit creek cases see bolded p value in table 9 did mlp perform better punn was significantly better in nine other cases not bolded p values in table 9 from tables 2 7 we find that mlp trained without dropout and air2stream models are always inferior to punn trained with input dropout and dp 0 9 0 998 this finding justifies the applicability of punn with product and summation nodes and with input dropout to stream temperature modelling the superiority of punn with input dropout over mlp with dropconnect may come from both the product nodes and the fact that punn has fewer parameters per node than mlp as a result punn may fit to a nonlinear relationship between inputs and output with fewer parameters for calibration and hence reduced overfitting the weaker performance of air2stream may also be an effect of fewer variables considered in this semi physically based model as it lacks information on the declination of the sun finally we perform a similar comparison as given above for subjectively chosen punn and mlp architectures with 10 hidden nodes and lag set to 15 the results are given in table 10 and respective statistical comparisons are given in tables 11 and 12 we see that for the chosen fixed architecture the results are similar to the ones obtained for the best punn and mlp architectures but with a few exceptions we note that for the fixed architecture hn 10 and lag 15 no dropout variant turned out efficient for the irondequoit creek catchment even the 50 runs averaged mse of punn with input dropout is not better than the mean mse for punn without dropout when the probability of retaining nodes is set to 0 998 the differences are marginal and statistically insignificant in other cases punn without dropout is a better choice in the case of other catchments input dropout is the best choice as found from comparison among all punn architectures see figs 2 7 and their best variants see tables 2 7 when the architectures of punn and mlp are fixed to hn 10 and lag 15 the differences between the performance of punn with input dropout and mlp with dropconnect are statistically significant for all catchments but cedar creek and for all of them punn is a better choice for cedar creek punn with input dropout also achieves a better performance but the differences are not significant at α 0 05 level this finding confirms the superiority of punn over mlp and the important positive impact of input dropout on the performance of punn in cases when the probability of dropping out nodes is low 7 discussion from the results shown we may observe that the basic versions of punn and mlp are overfitted to training samples this is marked in two ways first the mean mse values obtained for a testing data set are generally worse than the mean mse values obtained for training or validation sets while this may suggest overfitting one could argue that this may be just a matter of the specific data subsets for example that the years used for testing are potentially due to many reasons more difficult to model second the modelling improvement is observed for testing data if input dropout is used this would not be the case if only the testing data were more difficult to model and hence is a clearer indication of overfitting the presented results show that punn performs significantly better than mlp for stream temperature modelling the superiority of punn with input dropout seems to be clear for mountainous or hilly catchments it is more disputable for flat catchments located in more continental climatic conditions where snow melting during winter and thunder during summer plays an important role in generating runoff like the suprasl river in north eastern poland or the irondequoit creek in the western part of the state of new york it is however too early to claim that these are factors hampering input dropout or punn in general we have demonstrated that dropout and dropconnect regularization methods developed and widely used in deep learning networks le cun et al 2016 srivastava et al 2014 do not fulfil their roles when coupled with punn training this is in full contradiction with what was found for mlp networks piotrowski et al 2020 the reason is probably the exponential relationship between inputs and calibrated punn weights under which dropping out nodes adds too much disturbance during training however a simplified version of dropout implemented only to input nodes is very efficient for punn especially when the probability of retaining nodes is high 0 998 this means that in the case of punn s rare dropping out of an input extremely rarely a few inputs for a particular training sample and iteration gives possibility to a gradient based algorithm to escape from local minima and prevents overfitting to training samples if larger number of nodes are to be dropped out more often either by using dropout to all nodes in the networks or by decreasing the probability of retaining nodes the approach become harmful to punn 8 conclusions in the present study we have shown that product unit neural networks punn with a deep learning based method called dropout applied solely to model inputs and a high probability of retaining nodes set to 0 998 perform significantly better than punn networks without dropout multilayer perceptron neural networks or the air2stream model when applied for water temperature modelling in rivers at temperate climatic zones the improvement over competitive methods is noted especially in hilly or mountainous rivers the advantages are more disputable for flat more continental catchments using dropout for all nodes or for all connections between nodes within the punn networks or dropping input nodes much more frequently often highly deteriorates the performance and is not encouraged this is in contradiction to the results found recently for multi layer perceptron networks which gained the largest improvement from coupling with the dropconnect approach under which any connection between nodes within the network may temporarily be dropped out in contradiction to some more elaborative dropout variants like dropconnect the implementation of input dropout is straightforward and computational costs are negligible as punn with rare input dropout performs significantly better than punn without dropout and some other models for stream temperature modelling we encourage the research towards i verification of the effectiveness of punn with input dropout for other hydrological applications ii

4539,for about two decades neural networks are widely used for river temperature modelling however in recent years one has to distinguish between the classical shallow neural networks and deep learning networks the applicability of rapidly developing deep learning networks to stream water temperature modelling may be limited but some methods developed for deep learning if properly re considered may efficiently improve performance of shallow networks dropout is widely considered the method that allows deep learning networks to avoid overfitting to training data facilitating its implementations to versatile problems recently the successful applicability of dropout for river temperature modelling by means of shallow multilayer perceptron neural networks has been introduced in the present study we propose to use dropout solely for input neurons of product unit neural networks for the purpose of stream temperature modelling we perform tests on data collected from six catchments located in temperate climate zones on two continents in various orographic conditions we show that the average performance of product unit neural networks trained with input dropout is better than the average performance of product units without dropout product units with dropout applied to every layer of the networks multilayer perceptron neural networks with or without dropout and the semi physical air2stream model the advantage of product unit neural networks with input dropout is statistically significant on hilly or mountainous catchments the performance on flat ones is similar to the performances obtained from competitive models keywords product unit neural networks shallow artificial neural networks dropout water temperature modelling in rivers 1 introduction water temperature in rivers plays a crucial role for both aquatic biota webb et al 2008 patrick et al 2019 and human activities in the catchment van vliet et al 2013 behrens et al 2017 climatic changes have already affected the water temperatures in various rivers in the world especially in temperate or cold climatic zones orr et al 2015 paul et al 2019 modelling water temperature in streams is important to understand and anticipate the possible future of particular aquatic systems the modelling of stream temperature is often performed either by means of physically based dugdale et al 2017 semi physical models toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 or by data based methods benyahya et al 2007 each of these approaches has some advantages and disadvantages due to the often limited information on various environmental factors users frequently focus on data based models that often rely on a limited number of relatively easily obtained variables even though such models are rather doubtful for extrapolation beyond the ranges found within the calibration data among data based models artificial neural networks ann haykin 1999 goodfellow et al 2016 are probably the most widely used for stream temperature modelling chenard and caissie 2008 sahoo et al 2009 jeong et al 2013 cole et al 2014 hadzima nyarko et al 2014 piotrowski et al 2015 shi et al 2018 liu et al 2018 zhu et al 2019 rajaee et al 2020 although ann models have been applied to hydrological and atmospheric problems for over a quarter century abrahart et al 2012 cabaneros et al 2019 in recent few years a boom of deep learning methods has re gained wide interest in neural networks shen et al 2018 rasp et al 2018 nonetheless due to the huge number of parameters in deep learning networks lecun et al 2015 and numerous unsolved methodological difficulties lathuillere et al 2019 including vulnerability to so called adversarial examples carlini and wagner 2017 su et al 2019 their possible applicability for regression problems that rely on uncertain environmental data is yet to be shown zhu et al 2020a however even if deep learning networks would be too large for a specific hydro meteorological task some methods developed for deep learning methods may be worth implementing into simpler models krapu et al 2019 piotrowski et al 2020 in addition some deep learning models may be successfully used as single layered ones kratzert et al 2019 it is widely known that anns are universal approximators hornik et al 1989 and may suffer from the problem of overfitting geman et al 1992 haykin 1999 e g during training their parameters may fit not only to the signal that represents some property of the environment but also to the noise present in the training data sample although there are plenty of methods to cope with overfitting in shallow neural networks haykin 1999 liu et al 2008 see piotrowski and napiorkowski 2013 for comparison on water related problem with various rates of success dropout hinton et al 2012 srivastava et al 2014 is believed to be the novel approach that allowed deep learning methods to limit the impact of overfitting and work efficiently for numerous problems the dropout method is very simple during a network s training at each iteration for every training sample vector of input variables a randomly determined fraction of nodes is dropped out this is often implemented as multiplying outgoing signals from each node by 0 or 1 when 0 is chosen with probability 1 dp and 1 otherwise srivastava et al 2014 defined dp as the probability of retaining nodes in their paper and we follow this definition in the present study as a result only the shortened version of the network is trained in a particular iteration on the particular training pattern note that the removing of nodes is temporary and done for each iteration and training sample separately the final network contains all nodes hence after training all weights are to be multiplied by dp srivastava et al 2014 to compensate for processing the signals by the larger network the aim of dropout is to reduce the impact of single nodes on the performance of the whole network and to avoid overfitting to the noise present in the training sample reviews of dropout methodology and its numerous variants may be found in labach et al 2019 and piotrowski et al 2020 dropout is claimed to be suited not only for deep but also for shallow neural networks baldi and sadowski 2014 mianjy et al 2018 recently we have shown piotrowski et al 2020 that dropout and its variant dropconnect wan et al 2013 in which each connection between nodes may be dropped out instead of the full nodes do help in improving the performance of multilayer perceptron networks mlp for stream temperature simulations if the probability of retaining nodes dp is large i e only about 1 of nodes are dropped out dropping out about 1 of nodes during training improves the performance of shallow networks in two ways 1 it is high enough to prevent some nodes from having too large an impact on the final results and simultaneously it is small enough to avoid much disturbance to the model s training a shallow network has dozens or hundreds of nodes not thousands or millions as is the case for deep learning 2 by temporarily setting some of the network s parameters to 0 the problem dimensionality is reduced and hence the fitness landscape of the objective function malan and engelbrecht 2013 soltanolkotabi et al 2019 allowing the gradient based algorithm to leave local optima various metaheuristics may also be used for the neural network s training but their performance and speed is subject to an ongoing debate see piotrowski and napiorkowski 2011 ojha et al 2017 li et al 2019 although metaheuristics are often considered to be global search optimizers they are also prone to premature convergence see pandey et al 2014 and hence they may also benefit from a temporal reduction of problem dimensionality in the present paper we introduce dropout and dropconnect methods into other kinds of shallow networks namely product unit neural networks punn durbin and rumelhart 1989 due to the special features of punn we also propose using dropout for punn input variables only solely dropping out input nodes may be advantageous for product unit networks as it still allows both goals given above to be achieved but with a more limited disturbance to the model in which inputs are raised to the powers that are calibrated model parameters weights we compare the results obtained by punn with dropout dropconnect and input dropout against the results obtained by punn without dropout to present the results in a broader context we validate the performance of punn with various versions of dropout against mlp networks with and without dropout and by the popular semi physical air2stream model toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 considering the recent wide applicability of shallow neural networks in hydrology oceanology and atmospheric sciences crawford et al 2019 bergen et al 2019 berkhahn et al 2019 kulp and strauss 2019 sezen et al 2019 flombaum et al 2020 jia et al 2020 diez sierra and del jesus 2020 nourani et al 2020 mewes et al 2020 snieder et al 2020 we hope the proposed method may be beneficial not only for stream temperature modelling but possibly also other hydrological applications 2 catchments data sets and model input variables our research aims at modelling small to medium sized gauged catchments located in temperate climatic zones we aim at testing catchments with very different orographic conditions from high mountains to flat plains and with the diversified impact of snowy and winter conditions considering data availability we have chosen six catchments from the northern usa poland and switzerland located between 43 n and 54 n see a map in fig 1 the brief description of each catchment and data series used in this study is given in table 1 we aim at modelling stream temperature at a given cross section hence a daily stream temperature t t s is the output from the model where t is an index of the day the following variables are used as model inputs air temperature t t a from a number lag of recent days a single value per catchment for each day is used the discharge q t from the recent day observed at the same cross section as the stream temperature the declination of the sun calculated for every day of the year d s t and the difference in declination of the sun from two recent days ddst declination of the sun and difference in the declination at two consecutive days are important as these variables are the simplest substitutes for solar radiation and hence they improve the performance of stream temperature data driven models without any cost piotrowski and napiorkowski 2015 the precise number of data available for each catchment vary see table 1 but is not shorter than nine years of daily measurements in the case of five catchments air temperature measured at a single location within a catchment is used as t t a only in the case of the biala tarnowska catchment are five series of air temperatures measured at different locations used and catchment averaged air temperature is obtained for this catchment by means of the thiessen polygons method thiessen and alter 1911 the percentage values associated with each meteorological station in the biala tarnowska catchment are given in table 1 for each catchment the data are chronologically divided into the set used for calibration and the set used for independent testing of optimized neural networks specific periods are given in table 1 the first 2 3 of daily data from the calibration set is applied for training i e are used to compute objective function values during calibration and the remaining 1 3 of the data from the calibration set are used for validation i e to choose the optimal solution after the training algorithm terminates the testing set is not used during the calibration process at all and is composed of between 33 and 38 of available data as this study uses neural networks to obtain a modelled value of stream temperature for the particular day t t sm which means temperature of stream modelled for day t input variables must be adequately pre processed for each t th time step we create a vector composed of inputs xt that include observations of air temperature t t i 1 a from the pre specified number of lag previous days i 1 lag discharge from the recent day q t declination of the sun d s t and the difference in declinations of the sun in two recent days stream temperatures from recent days are not used as input variables for modelling future stream temperatures as we expect models to be applicable to future climatic conditions as it is not possible to know a priori how many recent air temperatures should be considered we test lag values from 1 to 18 hence the total number of input variables is in l a g 3 including q t d s t and d s t d s t 1 3 product unit neural networks with dropout in 1989 durbin and rumelhart 1989 proposed so called product unit anns punn which has both summation and product nodes in punn each input variable is raised to the power that is the network s parameter the values of these power weights are optimized during training if an input is negative and particular weight w kj between k th input and i th node is a non integer output would be a complex number which may lead to unphysical water temperature values as we cannot force values of w kj to be integers punn input variables need to be scaled to some positive interval martinez estudillo et al 2006 for example by 1 x k t 0 1 0 8 x k t x maxk x maxk x mink where xmaxk and xmink are the maximum and the minimum values in the whole data set of k th input variable the simplest version of punn introduced by durbin and rumelhart 1989 may be defined as follows 2 t t s f v 0 j 1 hn v j k 1 in x k t w kj where in and hn are the numbers of input and hidden nodes v and w are matrixes of parameters weights that are to be calibrated f is the activation function x t is the vector of scaled input variables and t t s is the output from punn that is then re scaled 3 t t sm t min s t max s t min s t t s 0 1 0 8 to obtain the modelled stream temperature t t sm in this study we consider only the simplest case with f being the identity function martinez estudillo et al 2006 piotrowski and napiorkowski 2012 hence eq 2 may be simplified to 4 t t s v 0 j 1 hn v j k 1 in x k t w kj we introduce classical bernoulli dropout srivastava et al 2014 into punn by multiplying all weights both the summation v and product w ones by binary matrix d in hn tr that is randomly regenerated in every iteration such that each element is set to 1 with probability dp and to 0 otherwise in d matrix in hn is the sum of nodes in input and hidden layers and tr is the number of patterns in training and validation data sets matrix d must be generated anew in each iteration as its role is not to skip permanently some connections within punn what would happen if the same d were used during the whole training but to avoid the case when some weights or input data gains too much impact on the final performance of the model the resulting punn with dropout is as follows 5 t t s v 0 j 1 hn v j d in j t k 1 in x k t d k t w kj after training the values of the neural network s parameters are to be multiplied by dp hence decreased as dp 1 to compensate for the fact that they were achieved with training on shortened variants of the final network srivastava et al 2014 and the final values of modelling criteria are evaluated for such an updated network in a similar way dropconnect wan et al 2013 a variant of dropout in which specific links between nodes are to be skipped instead of the whole nodes is introduced into punn in dropconnect d1 in hn tr binary matrix is used for all connections between input and hidden nodes and d2 hn tr binary matrix is used for connections between the hidden nodes and the single output hence when applying dropconnect into punn one obtains 6 t t s v 0 j 1 hn d 2 j t v j k 1 in x k t d 1 kj t w kj again after training all parameters are multiplied by dp as may be seen punn training with dropconnect will be more randomized than that with basic dropout so much randomness turned out to be advantageous for training the mlp that only has summation nodes piotrowski et al 2020 but may not be as useful for punn with product nodes hence for punn we also propose a third approach namely using dropout for input nodes only in such a case a single binary matrix d in tr is used as follows 7 t t s v 0 j 1 hn v j k 1 in x k t d k t w kj after training w parameters are multiplied by dp but v ones are not for each variant of dropout for punn the proper probability of retaining nodes dp needs to be found in the initial studies on deep learning networks hinton et al 2012 srivastava et al 2014 this value was set to about 0 5 which means that on average half of the nodes were dropped out in each case since then very different dp values were used in deep learning literature ranging from 0 1 trajanovski et al 2018 to 0 95 or even 1 depending on the network s layer fan et al 2017 in our previous study piotrowski et al 2020 we found that for shallow mlp networks applied to stream temperature modelling high values of the probability of retaining nodes dp close to 0 98 0 995 perform best lower values turned out to be harmful for shallow networks as they imply too much disturbance during training and prevent convergence to verify the choice for punn in this study dp values of 0 5 0 9 0 95 0 98 0 99 0 995 and 1 the last one means no dropout are tested all versions of punn eqs 4 7 in this study are trained with the classical second order gradient based levenberg marquardt algorithm lm hagan and menhaj 1994 that was widely used for neural networks in the past adamowski and karapataki 2010 graf et al 2019 zhu et al 2020b as required by the lm algorithm the objective function to be minimized during calibration is the mean square error mse 8 mse 1 n t 1 n t t sm t t s 2 here n is the number of data samples in the particular data set the maximum number of iterations of lm algorithm is set to 400 derivatives are numerically approximated during lm training during punn training a classical early stopping approach prechlet et al 1998 is applied to avoid overfitting irrespectively of whether dropout is used or not the calibration data are divided into two sub sets a training one that includes the first 2 3 of measurements from the calibration set chronologically and a validation one that includes the rest of the data from the calibration set during training moves of the lm algorithm are based only on derivatives and objective function values mse computed for the training data set after training the solution with the lowest mse value for the validation data is chosen it is very difficult to define a priori the proper architecture of a neural network for the specific task and data hence we consider all possible configurations of punn architectures with up to 18 lags hence up to 21 input variables and up to 12 hidden nodes this is computationally expensive but allows insight into the relationship between the complexity of punn architecture and the efficiency of both dropout variant and dp probability for each variant of punn eqs 4 7 for every catchment considered for each probability of retaining nodes dp and for each punn architecture the training is repeated 50 times starting from different randomly generated points in the solution space this provides us with a sample of results and hence makes the conclusions on usefulness of a particular methodology meaningful the best punn architecture for each catchment and the best variant of dropout is chosen according to the mean mse from 50 runs however this choice is made twice once based on mean mse from 50 runs obtained for the training data set the second time for the validation data set that enables us to verify the impact of specific periods from which training or validation data were collected on the final choice of the network s architecture or dp note that each time we compare the performance of architectures based on numerous runs not a single realization 4 multilayer perceptron neural networks with dropout multilayer perceptron neural networks mlp haykin 1999 are used in this study as a competitive method against punn to provide a fair comparison we use mlp with dropconnect and dp 0 99 as recommended in piotrowski et al 2020 and without dropout which is equivalent to dp 1 for mlp among various possible options the input variables were chosen to be scaled to a 0 1 interval by 9 x k t x k t x mink x maxk x mink where xmaxk and xmink are the maximum and the minimum values in the whole data set of k th input variable respectively we use linear activation functions in input and output layers and logistic activation function in hidden layer such mlp with dropconnect may be represented as follows 10 t t s v 0 j 1 hn d 2 j t v j 1 exp w j 0 k 1 in d 1 kj t w kj x k t in eq 10 we use the same notation as in eq 6 the modelled output is re scaled as 11 t t sm t min s t t s t max s t min s to keep the methodological parts of mlp identical with punn we use the same lm training algorithm the same early stopping method number of computations and identical division of data into training validation and testing sets as in punn we also test mlp architectures with numbers of input from 4 to 21 hence lag values from 1 to 18 and hidden nodes from 1 to 12 identical as in punn the same criteria of choosing the best mlp architectures are applied as in the case of punn 5 semi physically based air2stream model for broader validation of the results obtained by punn the semi physical air2stream model toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 is also used as a competitive method air2stream is based on a lumped heat budget that takes into account an unknown volume of water in the particular river its tributaries groundwater and heat exchange with an atmosphere by the following equation 12 ρ c p v d t w dt a h ρ c p i q i t w i q t w where v is an unknown volume of water of river reach with surface area a and water temperature tw ρ is water density with specific heat capacity at constant pressure cp h is the net heat flux between air and water qi is the discharge from the i th water source either tributary or groundwater with water temperature tw i q is the discharge downstream of the insertion of tributaries and t is time as discussed in toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 after parameterization of different variables from eq 12 the following version of air2stream with 8 parameters a1 a8 may be obtained 13 d t w dt 1 θ a 4 a 1 a 2 t a a 3 t w θ a 5 a 6 cos 2 π t t y a 7 a 8 t w θ q q q t 2 t 1 1 t 1 t 2 q t d t in eq 13 ta represents air temperature ty length of the year in days θ dimensionless streamflow and q mean discharge during the whole calibration data t1 to t2 denote the first and the last days of the calibration set the 4th order runge kutta method is used to solve eq 13 using water temperature from the first available day as the initial condition if some negative stream temperatures do appear during modelling by means of air2stream they are set to 0 c air2stream is calibrated 30 times for each catchment with the cobide wang et al 2014 algorithm as in piotrowski and napiorkowski 2018 note that when comparing ann models with air2stream one cannot avoid some clear differences that come up as a consequence of the use of very different kinds of models firstly for air2stream only measurements of air temperature and discharge are used contrary to anns that may use any numerical inputs using other variables is not possible for air2stream that has physical roots at least without developing a much different model secondly air2stream in the form presented in eq 13 requires information on the initial condition for each catchment to limit the impact of the initial condition on the modelling in this paper tw values simulated for the first 30 days are not used to evaluate model performance for calibration data thirdly air2stream does not need the training and validation data to be divided into subsets as it is not a universal approximator as a result its parameters are directly fitted to a larger number of data the whole calibration set in addition the air2stream model is calibrated 30 times for each catchment with the cobide wang et al 2014 evolutionary algorithm as in piotrowski and napiorkowski 2018 because the lm algorithm is not suitable for this task despite these differences the final comparison between the punn mlp and air2stream models is based on testing of the data sets which are of course identical for each model and are fully independent of the calibration procedures 6 results in this section we first analyze the impact of various dropout variants on the performance of punn instead of focusing on a specific punn architecture we discuss a broader picture and analyze all combinations of architectures within some limit to see how the impact of dropout variants is affected by increasing the complexity of the punn models to facilitate comparison amongst different kinds of modelling tools two additional approaches will be used firstly the best punn architectures and dropout variants will be chosen and their performance discussed against mlp networks and air2stream models secondly the models with the same subjectively chosen and fixed architecture with hn 10 and log 15 will be compared obviously the choice of architecture is made for punn and mlp but not for the air2stream model in figs 2 7 we show the relationship between the mean mse achieved by punn trained with a particular dropout variant against the number of hidden nodes hn used and the number of lag days lag from which the air temperature is applied as inputs note that the total number of input variables to punn equals lag 3 3 additional inputs are declination of the sun difference in two recent declinations of the sun and discharge from the most recent day only results obtained for testing data are illustrated in figs 2 7 in each figs 2 7 we show ten 3 dimensional plots for 3 dropout variants dropconnect classical dropout and input dropout and 3 probabilities of retaining nodes dp set to 0 9 0 99 and 0 998 the tenth bottom plot illustrates the results for punn without dropout what is equivalent to dp 1 which should be considered as a reference point in the further discussion to save space in this part of the discussion we skip other dp values tested but a brief glimpse at figs 2 7 convinces us that each dropout variant with dp 0 9 leads to much poorer results than those with dp 0 99 or 0 998 making illustrations with lower dp values e g 0 5 of marginal importance to focus on meaningful differences between the best performing punn architectures and dp probabilities for each catchment on figs 2 7 we truncate results with mse higher than some pre specified value e g 1 2 for the biala tarnowska river 0 3 for the dischmabach 0 55 for the fanno creek 1 for the irondequoit creek 0 8 for the cedar river and 1 8 for the suprasl river architectures with higher mean mse are shown simply as hitting this ceiling the truncation values are chosen subjectively for each catchment as mse values obtained for each catchment do differ such that variability of performance among model architectures that lead to meaningful results would be easily spotted on figures truncation values have no other meaning than to facilitate illustration of the main findings how the performances of punn with different dropout variants and probabilities are related with punn architectures without truncation values the results with very poor performances would dominate the illustrative plots hampering discussion from figs 2 7 we clearly see that when the probability of retaining nodes dp equals 0 9 the performance of almost all tested punn architectures is poorer than the assumed illustrative threshold for each river irrespective of which variant of dropout is considered obtained results with dp 0 9 or lower are much worse than the results achieved without dropout this may be noted by comparing the first row of plots against the lowest plot on each figure and explained as follows when dropping out on average 10 of the shallow network s nodes during training dp 0 9 too much randomness is introduced into the gradients computed by the calibration algorithm at a particular iteration and instead of reaching some local optimum it performs in chaotic steps if dropout of nodes occurs more rarely dp 0 99 or 0 998 the performance of punn with all three considered dropout variants is much better than when dp 0 9 was used see second and third row of plots on figs 2 7 with a low dp value in a particular iteration the work of a particular node is only affected for a very limited number of data pairs hence the algorithm generally follows the right direction but with some slight disturbance as a result it may get out of the local optima as dropping out a node modifies the fitness landscape and avoids falling into local solution nonetheless the classical dropout and dropconnect are de facto unable to improve results obtained by punn without dropout on four out of six catchments even when dp 0 99 or 0 998 the only two cases where classical dropout or dropconnect are justified are polish catchments the mountainous biala tarnowska and more noticeably the flat suprasl improving 2 out of 6 cases is not enough to recommend this particular approach as a result contrary to mlp networks see piotrowski et al 2020 the classical dropout or dropconnect may barely be useful for shallow punn models with product nodes if dropout is implemented to input nodes only see the plots in the right column of figs 2 7 the picture is much different in the case of all catchments the performance of punn architectures with input dropout and dp 0 99 or 0 998 is better than the performance of punn without dropout with the exception of the suprasl catchment the results obtained by punn with input dropout are also much better than those obtained by punn with classical dropout or dropconnect it is important to relate the performance of punn with input dropout to the network s architecture input dropout is especially efficient when the number of input and hidden nodes is larger however its positive impact on the punn results is often noted even when lag and hn are relatively low e g 5 6 note that it does not necessarily mean that the more nodes that are used the better the performance of punn too few nodes clearly make input dropout ineffective however when the number of input or hidden nodes become higher and higher the performance of punn with input dropout may improve until some limit and then start to deteriorate note that we discuss results obtained for testing data here that are independent of the calibration process for example on the fanno creek when lag exceeds 7 a decreasing performance of punn with input dropout is observed irrespective of the number of hidden nodes a similar decrease in performance of punn with input dropout is seen on the cedar creek when the number of hidden nodes exceeds 5 7 especially when lag is high hence the use of input dropout does not favour bigger networks rather it simply does not work for very small ones results obtained by punn input dropout indicate that rare dropping out inputs facilitate escaping shallow local optima and equally spread the processed information among the majority of nodes however too frequent dropout or dropping out connections between product and summation nodes does not allow the training method to converge to an optimum of sufficient quality this finding is in agreement with results obtained for mlp piotrowski et al 2020 with respect to the desired probability of retaining nodes dp however it is in full contradiction with the results achieved by mlp with respect to the number of specific connections that may be dropped out in mlp the best choice was dropconnect which allows for dropping out of each specific connection between nodes in punn the only beneficial one is the simplified variant of dropout applied solely to the whole input nodes above we have discussed the illustrative findings for the whole spectrum of tested punn architectures that were based only on testing data however comparison against other models would be facilitated by finding the best architectures of punn coupled with each dropout variant and comparing the mean mse values obtained for these best configuration of input and hidden nodes such architectures will be compared against the best architectures found for mlp neural networks and against the air2stream model because all combinations of architectures within 1 12 hidden nodes and 1 18 lags are tested explicitly in this study the choice of the best punn architecture is directly based on the empirical results and is decided separately for each variant of dropout and each dp value we make the choice of the best punn architecture twice once according to the mean mse obtained for training data set and the second time according to the mean mse for the validation set this allows us verifying if the two architectures chosen according to the performance on different data are similar the chosen best architectures are defined by hn and lag and their averaged mse results for training validation and testing data sets are shown for each catchment separately in tables 2 7 let us mention here that although we focus on a specific architecture in this part of the discussion results are still based on numerous realizations trainings of the particular architecture accordingly in each tables 2 7 the results obtained by the best architectures of mlp with dropconnect and dp 0 99 as suggested in piotrowski et al 2020 and by the best architectures of mlp without dropout are given in the case of air2stream there is no need to divide results into training and validation sets as no cross validation is performed due to the fact that air2stream is a semi physically based model toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 not a universal approximator hornik et al 1989 inter comparison among the best punn architectures associated with different dropout variants and dp probabilities show similar results as those inferred from plots illustrating the general performances of different punn architectures to verify the statistical significance of the results a two sample kolmogorov smirnov test is performed between punn without dropout and each variant of punn with dropout and dp probability in table 8 the p values of cases when the differences are statistically significant and punn with dropout is a better approach are shown i e has lower mean mse on the testing data set than punn without dropout the cases when punn without dropout is statistically significantly better at α 0 05 are marked and no means that the difference between two concerned models is insignificant the basic dropout and dropconnect are for the vast majority of catchments inefficient choices for punn punn without dropout is a statistically significantly better choice than punn with dropout or dropconnect irrespective of the dp on four catchments the only catchment on which dropout and dropconnect with dp 0 98 outperform punn without dropout is the suprasl results on the biala tarnowska are inconclusive on the contrary the best punn architecture selected for input dropout with dp 0 998 is according to testing data sets always better than the best architecture chosen for punn without dropout and with the exception of the irondequoit creek and only when validation data are used for choosing the best architecture the biala tarnowska catchment differences are strongly significant see p values in table 8 while reducing the probability of retained nodes in input dropout the overall statistically significant improvement over the no dropout scenario is noted until dp 0 98 this confirms conclusions from the comparison performed across all considered punn architectures discussed above for independent testing data the best punn architectures with input dropout and dp 0 99 0 998 chosen according to either training or validation data do perform better than mlp or air2stream models from tables 2 7 this is noted for all catchments but the irondequoit creek for which an equal performance is obtained by the best punn architecture with input dropout and dp 0 998 and the best mlp architecture with dropconnect and dp 0 99 the differences between the best punn architecture with input dropout and dp 0 998 and the best mlp architecture with dropconnect and dp 0 99 are statistically significant in 10 out of 12 comparisons six catchments and two ways of choosing the best architecture as depicted in table 9 among these 10 significant differences only in the irondequoit creek cases see bolded p value in table 9 did mlp perform better punn was significantly better in nine other cases not bolded p values in table 9 from tables 2 7 we find that mlp trained without dropout and air2stream models are always inferior to punn trained with input dropout and dp 0 9 0 998 this finding justifies the applicability of punn with product and summation nodes and with input dropout to stream temperature modelling the superiority of punn with input dropout over mlp with dropconnect may come from both the product nodes and the fact that punn has fewer parameters per node than mlp as a result punn may fit to a nonlinear relationship between inputs and output with fewer parameters for calibration and hence reduced overfitting the weaker performance of air2stream may also be an effect of fewer variables considered in this semi physically based model as it lacks information on the declination of the sun finally we perform a similar comparison as given above for subjectively chosen punn and mlp architectures with 10 hidden nodes and lag set to 15 the results are given in table 10 and respective statistical comparisons are given in tables 11 and 12 we see that for the chosen fixed architecture the results are similar to the ones obtained for the best punn and mlp architectures but with a few exceptions we note that for the fixed architecture hn 10 and lag 15 no dropout variant turned out efficient for the irondequoit creek catchment even the 50 runs averaged mse of punn with input dropout is not better than the mean mse for punn without dropout when the probability of retaining nodes is set to 0 998 the differences are marginal and statistically insignificant in other cases punn without dropout is a better choice in the case of other catchments input dropout is the best choice as found from comparison among all punn architectures see figs 2 7 and their best variants see tables 2 7 when the architectures of punn and mlp are fixed to hn 10 and lag 15 the differences between the performance of punn with input dropout and mlp with dropconnect are statistically significant for all catchments but cedar creek and for all of them punn is a better choice for cedar creek punn with input dropout also achieves a better performance but the differences are not significant at α 0 05 level this finding confirms the superiority of punn over mlp and the important positive impact of input dropout on the performance of punn in cases when the probability of dropping out nodes is low 7 discussion from the results shown we may observe that the basic versions of punn and mlp are overfitted to training samples this is marked in two ways first the mean mse values obtained for a testing data set are generally worse than the mean mse values obtained for training or validation sets while this may suggest overfitting one could argue that this may be just a matter of the specific data subsets for example that the years used for testing are potentially due to many reasons more difficult to model second the modelling improvement is observed for testing data if input dropout is used this would not be the case if only the testing data were more difficult to model and hence is a clearer indication of overfitting the presented results show that punn performs significantly better than mlp for stream temperature modelling the superiority of punn with input dropout seems to be clear for mountainous or hilly catchments it is more disputable for flat catchments located in more continental climatic conditions where snow melting during winter and thunder during summer plays an important role in generating runoff like the suprasl river in north eastern poland or the irondequoit creek in the western part of the state of new york it is however too early to claim that these are factors hampering input dropout or punn in general we have demonstrated that dropout and dropconnect regularization methods developed and widely used in deep learning networks le cun et al 2016 srivastava et al 2014 do not fulfil their roles when coupled with punn training this is in full contradiction with what was found for mlp networks piotrowski et al 2020 the reason is probably the exponential relationship between inputs and calibrated punn weights under which dropping out nodes adds too much disturbance during training however a simplified version of dropout implemented only to input nodes is very efficient for punn especially when the probability of retaining nodes is high 0 998 this means that in the case of punn s rare dropping out of an input extremely rarely a few inputs for a particular training sample and iteration gives possibility to a gradient based algorithm to escape from local minima and prevents overfitting to training samples if larger number of nodes are to be dropped out more often either by using dropout to all nodes in the networks or by decreasing the probability of retaining nodes the approach become harmful to punn 8 conclusions in the present study we have shown that product unit neural networks punn with a deep learning based method called dropout applied solely to model inputs and a high probability of retaining nodes set to 0 998 perform significantly better than punn networks without dropout multilayer perceptron neural networks or the air2stream model when applied for water temperature modelling in rivers at temperate climatic zones the improvement over competitive methods is noted especially in hilly or mountainous rivers the advantages are more disputable for flat more continental catchments using dropout for all nodes or for all connections between nodes within the punn networks or dropping input nodes much more frequently often highly deteriorates the performance and is not encouraged this is in contradiction to the results found recently for multi layer perceptron networks which gained the largest improvement from coupling with the dropconnect approach under which any connection between nodes within the network may temporarily be dropped out in contradiction to some more elaborative dropout variants like dropconnect the implementation of input dropout is straightforward and computational costs are negligible as punn with rare input dropout performs significantly better than punn without dropout and some other models for stream temperature modelling we encourage the research towards i verification of the effectiveness of punn with input dropout for other hydrological applications ii
