15050,pre ozonation coagulation process had a very low and narrow range of ozone dosages for enhancing the dissolved organic matter doc removal efficiency in which over oxidation may occur if the ozone dosage was not strictly controlled in contrast the proposed hybrid ozonation coagulation hoc process with higher oxidation ability notably inhibited over oxidation in this study and exhibited improved doc removal efficiency compared with coagulation at a much wider range of ozone dosages at different initial ph for the treatment of wwtp effluent the hoc process also had a higher doc removal efficiency than pre ozonation coagulation according to zeta potential analysis a rising trend indicated that complexation between organic matter and metal coagulants persisted throughout the hoc process however the zeta potential remained almost unchanged during subsequent coagulation after pre ozonation at high ozone dosages synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy analysis revealed that immediate entrapment and complexation between hydrolysed coagulants and oxidized intermediate organic matter occurred in the hoc process furthermore ft ir analysis showed that more oxygen containing functional groups were generated which were effectively trapped by metal coagulants and readily flocculated to further prove the immediate entrapment and complexation during the hoc process uplc q tof ms was applied to analyze the intermediate organic matter in the supernatant and flocs the results implied that c21 organic matter was oxidized and decomposed into c11 c20 and c11 c20 intermediate organic matter was trapped and complexed by metal coagulants once formed which led to the increase of c11 c20 in the flocs nevertheless the catalytic ozonation process γ al2o3 o3 with the same oxidation ability as the hoc process decomposed the organic matter into c1 c10 xps analysis further confirmed the immediate entrapment and removal of aliphatic aromatic carbon and oxygen containing functional groups during the hoc process therefore over oxidation can be effectively inhibited and wide range of ozone dosages was obtained during the hoc process which facilitate the application of the hoc process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords over oxidation hybrid ozonation coagulation process intermediate organic matter immediate complexation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction coagulation is often applied as the key process during the advanced treatment of wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent which can effectively remove particulate matter and colloidal substances li et al 2017 however a poor wwtp effluent organic matter efom removal performance is typically obtained using coagulation alone because of the existence of emerging contaminants and soluble microbial products which have a low coagulability qiu et al 2022 in addition wwtp effluent is one of the major sources of emerging contaminants which potentially affect aquatic organisms and threaten the sustainability of aquatic ecosystems tran et al 2018 therefore pre oxidation processes are employed to enhance the following coagulation performance and further improve the organic matter removal performance naceradska et al 2017 because of the strong oxidation ability and ease of handling ozonation has been widely used in the pre oxidation process yang et al 2017 pre ozonation can enhance dissolved organic matter removal by subsequent coagulation farvardin and collins 1989 sadrnourmohamadi and gorczyca 2015 for enhanced organic removal performance in the coagulation pre ozonation produces some hydrophobic neutral and intermediate molecular weight dissolved organic matter at suitable ozone dosages yan et al 2007 favorable pre ozonation can improve the concentration of oxygen containing functional groups such as carboxylic and hydroxyl groups which can interact and complex with hydrolysed coagulants to promote coagulation in ozonated waters reckhow et al 1986 nevertheless the so called suitable ozone dosages for pre ozonation to enhance subsequent coagulation are always very low liu et al 2021 yan et al 2007 reported that a low ozone dosage 1 0 mg l during the pre ozonation promoted organic matter removal in subsequent coagulation while a higher ozone dosage 2 0 mg l during pre ozonation adversely impacted organic matter removal chiang et al 2009 concluded that pre ozonation at a high ozone dosage e g 6 63 mgo3 l was not recommended for natural organic matter removal and the recommended ozone dosage was around 3 51 mgo3 l for optimal doc removal in subsequent coagulation our previous work also indicated that the humic acid removal efficiency can be improved by pre ozonation only at an ozone dosage range lower than 3 85 mg l hu et al 2021 therefore over oxidation frequently occurs when the ozone dosage is not strictly controlled due to the very narrow ozone dosage range and water quality fluctuations liu et al 2021 novotná et al 2020 more hydrophilic and lower molecular weight organic matter generation due to over oxidation results in low coagulability and complexation capability which are the main drawbacks of using pre ozonation coagulation process our previous studies proposed the hybrid ozonation coagulation hoc process in which ozonation and coagulation occurred simultaneously in one unit jin et al 2017 jin et al 2020 jin et al 2021b a higher efom removal efficiency can be obtained in the hoc process compared with pre ozonation coagulation jin et al 2017 jin et al 2020 in the hoc process hydrolysed metal coagulants act as ozone catalysts to enhance the generation of reactive oxygen species such as oh and o2 resulting in a stronger oxidation ability compared with ozonation alone jin et al 2019 theoretically more hydrophilic low molecular weight organic acids can be formed during the hoc reactions which inhibit the coagulation performance nevertheless the hoc process has a wider range of ozone dosages for improving organic matter removal 11 mgo3 l than the pre ozonation coagulation process 3 85 mgo3 l hu et al 2021 the influence of pre ozonation on subsequent coagulation is closely related to the characteristics and structure of organic matter matilainen et al 2010 hydrophobic organic matter with intermediate molecular weight and proper structure such as aromatic structures with carboxyl or hydroxyl groups facilitates coagulation song et al 2019 yan et al 2007 the mechanisms of organic matter removal by coagulation include a combination of entrapment charge neutralization adsorption and complexation with metal coagulants to form insoluble particulate aggregates matilainen et al 2010 however it is very difficult to directly take small hydrophilic organic matters from the dissolved state to the undissolved state by the above coagulation mechanisms zong et al 2022 therefore because the oxidation and coagulation occur simultaneously in the hoc process hydrolysed metal coagulants can immediately trap and complex with oxidized intermediate organics with appropriate structures once they are formed in other words the oxidized intermediate organic matter with proper structures hydrophobic and intermediate molecular weight dissolved organic matter with carboxyl or hydroxyl groups can be readily trapped and complexed by hydrolysed metal coagulants before they are oxidized into small hydrophilic acids however this hypothesis has not been verified and may be involved in the interactions between oxidation coagulation and organic matter in this study the organic matter removal efficiency of the hoc and pre ozonation coagulation process was compared over the same ozone dosage range and different initial ph values for the treatment of wwtp effluent to investigate the over oxidation inhibition phenomena in addition the proposed over oxidation inhibition mechanism of immediate entrapment and complexation between oxidized intermediate organics and metal coagulants during the hoc process was unveiled from the aspects of complexation and intermediate organic matter characterization 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents

performance of the pre ozonation coagulation and hoc processes the doc removal performance of the pre ozonation coagulation and hoc processes for the treatment of wwtp effluent at initial ph 5 and 7 was investigated fig 1 according to fig 1 for the pre ozonation coagulation process the maximum doc removal efficiency appeared at ozone dosages reacted ozone dosages of 0 1 and 1 3 mg l at initial ph 5 and 7 respectively with the corresponding doc removal efficiencies of 30 14 and 24 88 afterwards the doc removal efficiency decreased with increasing ozone dosage for the pre ozonation coagulation at both initial ph 5 and 7 when the ozone dosage exceeded 16 3 mg l 5 doc removal efficiency was obtained which was even lower than coagulation alone a similar result was also found by pei et al 2007 who reported that the toc removal efficiency increased from 23 to 38 with the increase of ozone dosage from 0 to 0 85 mg l in the pre ozonation process further increasing the ozone dosage did not increase the toc removal efficiency hu et al 2021 also found that with the ozone dosage range of 0 3 85 mg l the doc removal efficiency of the pre ozonation coagulation process was higher than that of coagulation process however the removal efficiency decreased when the ozone dosage exceeded 3 85 mg l the doc removal efficiency improvement at lower ozone dosages can be attributed to an increase in the number of oxygen containing functional groups such as carboxyl and hydroxyl of organic matter after pre ozonation li et al 2019 which improved the complexation between metal coagulants and organic matter song et al 2019 and further enhanced the coagulation performance chandrakanth and amy 1996 chen and yeh 2005 meanwhile the molecular weight and negative charge density of organic matter were reduced by ozonation at a low dosage which can effectively promote the destabilization of colloidal particles and improve the organic matter removal chandrakanth and amy 1996 xie et al 2013 furthermore the decreased doc removal efficiency at higher ozone dosages was due to the over oxidation of organic matter which converted high molecular organic matter into low molecular organic matter the accumulation of small molecular organic matter containing large amounts of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups produced by ozonation under high ozone dosage caused hydrophilicity and negative charge density increasing farvardin and collins 1989 xie et al 2016 which was not conducive to subsequent coagulation wang et al 1999 therefore for the pre ozonation process it is important to strictly control the ozone dosage within a narrow range therefore unstable and relatively low doc removal performance can be expected due to the over oxidation of organic matter especially during water quality variations in the hoc process within the tested ozone dosage range 0 58 mg l the doc removal efficiency was always higher at both initial ph 5 and 7 than that of coagulation alone fig 1 and pre ozonation alone fig s2 upon increasing the ozone dosage the doc removal efficiency slightly decreased but remained above 20 throughout the hoc process which is much higher than that of the pre ozonation coagulation process according to previous studies the interactions between ozone and hydroxyl groups on hydrolysed metal coagulant species surface can enhance the generation of ros such as oh during the hoc process jin et al 2017 jin et al 2019 jin et al 2020 meanwhile the presence of ozone can promote the formation of polymerized al species and accelerate the transformation of al species hydrolysis from low polymerized species to high polymerized species jin et al 2021a jin et al 2021b therefore the synergistic effects between ozonation and coagulation can promote both the oxidation and coagulation ability which enhanced the organic matter removal performance in the hoc process nevertheless ozone promoted the removal performance of the hoc process over a much wider ozone dosage range compared with pre ozonation coagulation process in the hoc system once the oxidized intermediate organic matter formed it will be readily trapped and complexed by the metal coagulant hydrolysed species this may be the reason why the over oxidation of organic matter can be inhibited during the hoc process with stronger oxidation ability based on fig 1 over oxidation of organic matter occurred in the pre ozonation coagulation process and completely inhibited the following coagulation when the ozone dosage was higher than 16 3 mg l for both initial ph 5 and 7 compared with the pre ozonation coagulation process the hoc process exhibited a higher doc removal efficiency and a wider ozone dosage range for improving the removal performance which resulted in stronger adaptability the ozone dosage of 16 3 mg l was the critical value for over oxidation in the pre ozonation coagulation process therefore 16 3 mg l was selected as the ozone dosage in the subsequent experiments to elucidate the over oxidation inhibition mechanism in this study 3 2 complexation characteristics of oxidized organic matter 3 2 1 zeta potential analysis the zeta potential analysis of the different processes is shown in fig 2 according to fig 2 a and b at low ozone dosages the zeta potential of organic matter increased after pre ozonation and then decreased with the increasing of ozone dosage as shown in fig 2 a the highest zeta potential of organic matter after pre ozonation reached 7 14 mv at an ozone dosage of 0 1 mg l at initial ph 5 when the ozone dosage exceeded 16 3 mg l the zeta potential was very low 12 mv a similar trend was observed at initial ph 7 where the highest zeta potential was 5 mv at an ozone dosage of 1 3 mg l and decreased below 15 mv at ozone dosages above 16 3 mg l fig 2 b when using a low ozone dosage during pre ozonation the zeta potential increased due to a decrease in the negative charge density chandrakanth and amy 1996 and the organic matter was oxidized appropriately farvardin and collins 1989 found a strong positive correlation between ozone dosage and charge density at ozone dosages lower than the optimal dosage of 0 3 mg l therefore the main mechanism by which pre ozonation process improved the coagulation performance at low concentration ozone oxidation was the reduction in the charge density of organic matter however adverse effect of ozonation on coagulation occurred at higher ozone dosages and the decreasing zeta potential was attributed to the over oxidation of organic matter hu et al 2021 which was the result of the accumulation of small molecular organic matter containing abundant carboxyl and hydroxyl groups chang et al 2002 fig 2 c also verified this phenomenon of over oxidation of organic matter at a low ozone dosage 0 1 mg l at ph 5 and 1 3 mg l at ph 7 the zeta potential increased continuously as the pre ozonation progressed while at a high ozone dosage 16 3 mg l the zeta potential decreased gradually in the middle and later stages of pre oxidation as shown in fig 2 d during the coagulation process after pre ozonation at initial ph 5 the zeta potential gradually increased at an ozone dosage of 0 1 mg l while the zeta potential varied only slightly at an ozone dosage of 16 3 mg l the main coagulation mechanism at initial ph 5 was mainly complexation between coagulants and organic matter naceradska et al 2019 the negative charge density was reduced after ozone oxidation at a low dosage which was beneficial to increase the opportunity for particle collisions and complexation during the subsequent coagulation process chandrakanth and amy 1996 xie et al 2016 xie et al 2013 therefore the zeta potential gradually increased during subsequent coagulation at an ozone dosage of 0 1 mg l however the zeta potential was low after ozonation at high ozone dosages and it was difficult for organic matter to be complexed and precipitated chang et al 2002 which reduced the doc removal efficiency the zeta potential of organic matter changed little in the subsequent coagulation process either at low or high ozone dosages at initial ph 7 that was because sweep flocculation was the main coagulation mechanism at initial ph 7 prokopova et al 2021 and organic matter was removed by the adsorption of al oh 3 s duan and gregory 2003 according to fig 2 a and b the zeta potentials at initial ph 5 and ph 7 at the end of reactions during the hoc process at different ozone dosages were about 2 and 8 mv respectively which were favorable conditions for the coagulation process chekli et al 2017 meanwhile as shown in fig 2 d and e throughout the hoc process the zeta potential continuously increased indicating that complexation between organic matter and metal coagulants persisted in the hoc process jin et al 2018 the synergistic effects between ozonation and coagulation during the hoc process made metal coagulants act as catalyst to catalyze ozone to generate oh as well as coagulants to complex with organic matters which were modified by oh oxidation jin et al 2019 jin et al 2021b the epr spectra of the pre ozonation process and hoc process fig s3 proved that more oh was generated during the hoc process indicating that the hoc process had a stronger oxidation ability than the pre ozonation process in the hoc process with stronger oxidation ability the oxidized intermediate organic matter formed by the hoc reactions did not accumulate but was immediately trapped and complexed by the hydrolysed species of metal coagulants which was manifested as a stable increase in the zeta potential in fig 2 d and e 3 2 2 synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy analysis the complexation of organic matter and metal coagulants is often manifested as fluorescence enhancement or quenching chen et al 2015 variations in the fluorescence intensity during the coagulation process can be observed in fig 3 a and b the fluorescence intensity decreased after complexation between organic matter and metal coagulants during the coagulation process at both initial ph 5 and ph 7 moreover a greater decrease was found at initial ph 5 than that at initial ph 7 a similar result was also found by jin et al 2018 who reported that al organic ligand complexation resulted in fluorescence quenching therefore the complexation between organic matter and hydrolysed coagulants species was dominant at initial ph 5 because the main mechanism of coagulation at ph 5 was charge neutralization duan and gregory 2003 however for initial ph 7 the complexation was not obvious which implied that the sweep flocculation between al oh 3 s produced by hydrolysis and organic matter was the main coagulation mechanism righetto et al 1991 according to fig s4 the maximum fluorescence intensity was observed at 1 min complexation after pre ozonation therefore 1 min was selected as the complexation time after pre ozonation and hoc quenching meanwhile adding coagulants to the pre ozonation coagulation system and hoc system at the end of the reaction did not further increase the doc removal efficiency which verified the 10 mg l coagulants added at the beginning of the reaction was sufficient for the whole process fig s5 as shown in fig 3 c and d complexation between the formed oxidized intermediate organic matter by the pre ozonation process and coagulants increased the fluorescence intensity due to the complexation during the coagulation process at initial ph 5 instead of a coagulation process dominated by sweep flocculation at initial ph 7 duan and gregory 2003 prokopova et al 2021 the fluorescence intensity increase was more significant at initial ph 5 than that at initial ph 7 when the ozone oxidation time was less than 3 min the fluorescence intensity was enhanced after complexation when the ozone oxidation time exceeded 3 min the fluorescence intensity was also higher than that after pre ozonation but the increased amplitude did not change as the reactions progressed this indicated that with the increase of ozone oxidation time the degree of complexation between organic matter and coagulants did not increase that may be caused by the over oxidation of organic matter which lead to the accumulation of low molecular weight organic matter that was difficult to be complexed with coagulants chu et al 2020 according to fig s6 when the ozone oxidation time was 15 min at an ozone dosage of 16 3 mg l the doc removal efficiency in the subsequent coagulation process was always very low at both initial ph 5 and ph 7 therefore when the ozonation time exceeded 3 min the low molecular weight organic matter and oxygen containing groups generated by ozone oxidation began to accumulate xie et al 2016 and the doc removal efficiency in the coagulation process was greatly limited when ozonation time reached 15 min which was consistent with the zeta potential analysis in fig 2 c fig 3 e and f show that when the hoc reaction time was less than 1 min the fluorescence intensity increased in the subsequent 1 min complexation process after the reactive oxygen species were quenched that indicated complexation between intermediate organic matter and hydrolysed coagulant species occurred in the subsequent 1 min complexation process when the hoc reaction time exceeded 1 min the fluorescence intensity remained unchanged during the following 1 min complexation indicating complexation reactions between intermediate organic matter and hydrolysed coagulant species were limited at this time jin et al 2021b found that in the hoc process ozone reacted with organic matter in the first minute and then reacted with the hydroxyl groups on hydrolysed metal coagulant species surface to form oh therefore in the first 1 min of the hoc process organic matter was more likely to react with ozone rather than be trapped and complexed via coagulation in the subsequent complexation process after the reactive oxygen species were quenched the intermediate organic matter formed by ozonation in the system began to complex with the hydrolysed coagulant species which was verified as an increase in the fluorescence intensity after 1 min reaction during the hoc process because the intermediate organic matter formed by ozone and oh oxidation was removed through immediate entrapment and complexation by hydrolysed species there was no excess intermediate organic matter to complex with the hydrolysed coagulant species in the subsequent complexation process this was verified by the unchanged fluorescence intensity meanwhile the variation of the doc removal efficiency during the pre ozonation coagulation and hoc reaction showed that organic matter was gradually removed throughout the hoc process fig s6 which further confirmed that the intermediate organic matter was trapped and removed after being produced by the hydrolysed coagulant species during the hoc reaction 3 2 3 ft ir analysis changes in the functional groups involved in complexation in different processes were analyzed by ft ir spectroscopy the oh and cooh were the main functional groups that complexed with metal coagulants li et al 2018 the peak at 3410 cm 1 corresponded to the stretching vibration of oh groups machado et al 2020 and the peaks at 1645 cm 1 and 1384 cm 1 corresponded to the asymmetric stretching vibrations c o and the symmetric stretching vibrations c o of coo groups respectively liu et al 2022 fig s7 shows the ft ir spectra of the supernatant and flocs during the coagulation process at initial ph 5 and 7 as the coagulation process progressed the intensity of the characteristic peaks of the oh and coo groups in the supernatant decreased gradually at both initial ph 5 and 7 which was due to the complexation of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups with coagulants song et al 2019 however the peak intensities of oh and coo in flocs did not vary significantly which may be attributed to the limited removal efficiency of organic matter in the coagulation process zong et al 2022 and the ineffective transfer of organic matter into flocs fig 4 a and b show the ft ir spectra of the supernatant in the pre ozonation process at an ozone dosage of 16 3 mg l the intensity of characteristic peaks belonging to oh and coo gradually increased with the increase of ozonation time at both initial ph 5 and ph 7 because ozonation increased the number of oxygen containing groups huang et al 2020 li et al 2019 however during the subsequent coagulation the characteristic peak intensities of oh and coo in the supernatant decreased in the early stage and remained unchanged in the later stage fig 4 c and d this indicated that complexation between organic matter and coagulants only occurred in the early stage of coagulation process despite the generation of more complexation active sites meanwhile fig 4 e and f show that the characteristic peaks of oh and coo in the flocs increased only during the early stage of the reaction and remained almost unchanged in the later stage this confirmed that the organic matter was not effectively transferred to flocs during the subsequent coagulation of the pre ozonation process at an ozone dosage of 16 3 mg l because of the difficulties in complexation with coagulants this may be attributed to the over oxidation of organic matter at a high ozone dosage of 16 3 mg l hu et al 2021 which was not conducive to complexation during the coagulation chang et al 2002 as shown in fig 5 a and c during the hoc process the intensities of the characteristic peak of oh and coo in the supernatant increased slightly in the first 1 min and decreased continuously in the later stage during the hoc process ozone preferentially reacted with organic matter in the first 1 min jin et al 2021b which increased the content of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups huang et al 2020 after 1 min ozone interacted with the coagulants to produce oh jin et al 2020 and the generated intermediate organic matter complexed with the hydrolysed coagulant species immediately which was manifested by the continuous decrease in the characteristic peak intensity of oh and coo meanwhile the intensity of the characteristic peaks belonging to oh and coo in the flocs increased gradually fig 5 b and fig 5 d this indicated that the reactive oxygen species produced during the hoc process promoted the generation of more oxygen containing functional groups and they can be effectively trapped by hydrolysed coagulant species into flocs hu et al 2021 which further proved that the complexation between intermediate organic matter and hydrolysed coagulants was instantaneous in addition the content of carboxyl groups which were typical complexation active sites with metal coagulants was measured by the modified boehm titration method liu et al 2022 wu et al 2022 the content of carboxyl groups in the flocs during the different processes at ozone dosage of 16 3 mg l at initial ph 5 and 7 can be seen in fig s8 the results were consistent with the ft ir results fig 4 fig 5 and fig s7 which further proved that the existence of immediate entrapment and complexation between intermediate organic matter and coagulants promoted the effective transfer of organic matter to flocs and inhibited the over oxidation of organic matter in the hoc process 3 3 transformation of oxidized intermediate organic matter 3 3 1 intermediate organic matter analysis as shown in figs 6 and 7 the transformation of oxidized intermediate organic matter during different processes was analyzed by uplc q tof ms in this study organic matter was divided into three categories i e c1 10 c11 20 and c21 and their cumulative abundance in supernatant and flocs at initial ph 5 and 7 during the hoc reactions are shown in fig 6 a and fig 6 b at both initial ph 5 and 7 the cumulative abundance of c11 c20 and c21 in the supernatant decreased as the hoc reactions progressed while the cumulative abundance of c1 c10 exhibited limited variations meanwhile it was also observed that the cumulative abundance of c11 c20 increased significantly in the flocs as the hoc reactions progressed while the cumulative abundance of c1 c10 and c21 did not vary significantly to further explain the variations in intermediate organic matter during the hoc process a catalytic ozonation system γ al2o3 o3 was established as a comparison which produced the same amount of oh as the hoc process fig s9 as shown in fig 6 c and fig 6 d in the catalytic system at initial ph 5 and 7 the cumulative abundance of c11 c20 and c21 gradually decreased as the reactions progressed while the cumulative abundance of c1 c10 increased this indicated that in the γ al2o3 o3 system which had the same oxidation ability as the hoc system c11 c20 and c21 tended to be oxidized and decomposed into low carbon number organic matter c1 c10 su et al 2022 therefore the decrease in the c21 content in the supernatant during the hoc process should tend to be oxidized into low carbon number organic matter c1 c10 however when c21 organic matter was decomposed into c11 c20 it was more likely to be trapped and removed by hydrolysed coagulant species immediately in the hoc system rather than continue to be oxidized and decomposed into c1 c10 therefore the organic matter in the flocs was mainly distributed in c11 c20 according to the ft ir spectra fig 5 increased organics with oh and cooh groups were observed in flocs during the hoc process indicating that the c11 c20 transferred to flocs during the hoc process was rich in oh and cooh groups which was conducive to coagulation the organic matter obtained by uplc q tof ms analysis was mainly distributed in the range between m z 200 and 400 tables s2 s9 and the distribution of organic matter between m z 200 and 400 in the hoc process is shown in fig 7 in the negative ion mode for example the intensities of c21h34o3 c21h26n2o3 c21h22o5 and c26h36o3 in the supernatant at initial ph 5 fig 7 c and the intensities of c21h34o3 c22h28o3 and c26h36o3 in the supernatant at initial ph 7 fig 7 g decreased as hoc reactions progressed however they did not appear in the flocs fig 7 d and h which indicated that they were oxidized and decomposed rather than trapped and removed by the hydrolysed coagulant species at the same time organic matter such as c15h22o3 c16h14o3 and c15h14o6 at initial ph 5 and c13h14o3 c14h24o2 and c11h16n2o3 at initial ph 7 which did not exist in the supernatant appeared in the flocs this can be attributed to the formation of intermediate organic matter from high carbon organic matter which was readily trapped by metal coagulants the same phenomenon was observed in positive ion mode fig 7 a b e and f indicating that c21 was oxidized and decomposed into c11 c20 and intermediate organic matter of c11 c20 was trapped and complexed by hydrolysed coagulant species as soon as they formed 3 3 2 xps analysis xps was used to further analyze the transformation characteristics of intermediate organic matter in the supernatant and flocs during the different processes the c1s spectra in the γ al2o3 o3 process and hoc process are shown in fig s10 fig s12 the four peaks at 284 76 ev 285 44 ev 286 17 ev and 288 67 ev were assigned to c c c h and aromatic c c o c o and ho c o respectively huang et al 2020 according to fig 8 a and b in the γ al2o3 o3 process as the reactions progressed the proportion of oxygen containing functional groups at initial ph 5 and 7 gradually increased reaching 55 93 and 56 28 respectively after 15 min reaction this can be attributed to the oxidation of ozone and oh xue et al 2022 which also indicated that organic matter tended to be transformed into low carbon organic matter containing more oxygen containing functional groups during the γ al2o3 o3 process however in the hoc process with the same oh content as the γ al2o3 o3 process the percentage of oxygen containing functional groups in the system increased at both initial ph 5 and 7 after 1 min reaction fig 8 c and d this was because organic matter tended to be oxidized by ozone in the first 1 min of the hoc reactions jin et al 2021b resulting in the production of more oxygen containing functional groups huang et al 2020 after 1 min reactions in the hoc process the ratio of oxygen containing functional groups and aliphatic carbon aromatic carbon did not vary significantly in the supernatant and the same phenomenon was observed in the flocs fig 8 c and d during the hoc process organic matter was oxidized to intermediate organic matter that contained many oxygen containing functional groups due to oxidation by ozone and oh jin et al 2022 this intermediate organic matter was trapped by hydrolysed coagulant species into flocs immediately after formation aliphatic carbon aromatic carbon and oxygen containing functional groups were synchronously transferred from solution to flocs which was manifested by an insignificant variation in their ratio these results further confirmed that after 1 min reaction in the hoc process intermediate organic matter of c11 c20 produced by the oxidation of organic matter by reactive oxygen species had a higher content of oxygen containing functional groups their further oxidation and decomposition were blocked by the entrapment and complexation process after the formation of c11 c20 they were trapped readily during the flocculation by the hydrolysed coagulant species 3 4 proposed over oxidation inhibition mechanism within the hoc process based on the results described above the over oxidation inhibition mechanism within the hoc process was verified which involved the immediate entrapment and complexation between hydrolysed coagulants and oxidized intermediate organic matter fig 9 in the hoc process ozone oxidation and coagulation of organic matter occurred in the same system jin et al 2017 the interactions between ozone and hydroxyl groups on hydrolysed metal coagulant species surface enhanced the oh generation jin et al 2020 ozone reacted preferentially with organic matter in the first 1 min of hoc reaction jin et al 2021b and then the intermediate organic matter formed by ozone oxidation was trapped and removed by coagulation fig 3 after 1 min the reaction between ozone and coagulants began and a large amount of oh was generated fig s3 at this time organic matter was further oxidized and decomposed by oh and ozone when the high carbon organic matter c21 was decomposed into c11 c20 the pathway of further oxidation of c11 c20 to c1 c10 was blocked due to the immediate entrapment and complexation by metal coagulants and c11 c20 gradually accumulated in the flocs fig 6 and fig 7 this reaction process occurred immediately which prevented the accumulation of small hydrophilic organic matter during the hoc process meanwhile the formed c11 c20 intermediate organic matter by ozone and oh oxidation was rich in complexing active functional groups of oh and coo figs 5 and 6 which made it easier for them to be immediately trapped and complexed by coagulants after their formation xie et al 2016 subsequently due to the continuous immediate entrapment and complexation of organic matter by coagulants the negative charge density of the hoc system decreased gradually fig 2 d and e which was more conducive to the immediate entrapment and complexation therefore the over oxidation of organic matter in the hoc process was inhibited and the hoc process exhibited a higher and more stable organic matter removal efficiency over a wider range of ozone dosages than the pre ozonation coagulation process 4 conclusion the traditional pre ozonation coagulation process had improved doc removal efficiency only at the ozone dosage of 0 16 3 mg l for the treatment of wwtp effluent with respect to coagulation alone when the ozone dosage increased 16 3 mg l the doc removal efficiency was lower than coagulation alone due to over oxidation in contrast the hoc process exhibited improved doc removal performance compared with coagulation over a much wider ozone dosage range of 0 58 mg l with an even higher oxidation ability through zeta potential analysis over oxidation in the pre ozonation coagulation process led to the excessive accumulation of small molecular organic matter at high ozone dosages which reduced the zeta potential and inhibited subsequent coagulation during the hoc reactions the zeta potential continued to rise combined with the synchronous fluorescence analysis the entrapment and complexation of intermediate organic matter and coagulants occurred continuously and immediately which inhibited the over oxidation of organic matter based on the ft ir and uplc q tof ms analysis a large amount of c11 c20 intermediate organic matter rich in oxygen containing functional groups accumulated in the flocs which was generated through the decomposition of high carbon organic matter c21 by oxidation this c11 c21 intermediate organic matter was trapped and removed by coagulants immediately after being produced instead of continuing to be oxidized to c1 c10 organics the immediate simultaneous transfer of aliphatic aromatic carbon and oxygen containing functional groups from solution to flocs was confirmed by xps analysis as a consequence the immediate entrapment and complexation between hydrolysed coagulants and oxidized intermediate organic matter inhibited the over oxidation of organic matter and widened the range of ozone dosages in the hoc process declaration of competing interest the

15050,pre ozonation coagulation process had a very low and narrow range of ozone dosages for enhancing the dissolved organic matter doc removal efficiency in which over oxidation may occur if the ozone dosage was not strictly controlled in contrast the proposed hybrid ozonation coagulation hoc process with higher oxidation ability notably inhibited over oxidation in this study and exhibited improved doc removal efficiency compared with coagulation at a much wider range of ozone dosages at different initial ph for the treatment of wwtp effluent the hoc process also had a higher doc removal efficiency than pre ozonation coagulation according to zeta potential analysis a rising trend indicated that complexation between organic matter and metal coagulants persisted throughout the hoc process however the zeta potential remained almost unchanged during subsequent coagulation after pre ozonation at high ozone dosages synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy analysis revealed that immediate entrapment and complexation between hydrolysed coagulants and oxidized intermediate organic matter occurred in the hoc process furthermore ft ir analysis showed that more oxygen containing functional groups were generated which were effectively trapped by metal coagulants and readily flocculated to further prove the immediate entrapment and complexation during the hoc process uplc q tof ms was applied to analyze the intermediate organic matter in the supernatant and flocs the results implied that c21 organic matter was oxidized and decomposed into c11 c20 and c11 c20 intermediate organic matter was trapped and complexed by metal coagulants once formed which led to the increase of c11 c20 in the flocs nevertheless the catalytic ozonation process γ al2o3 o3 with the same oxidation ability as the hoc process decomposed the organic matter into c1 c10 xps analysis further confirmed the immediate entrapment and removal of aliphatic aromatic carbon and oxygen containing functional groups during the hoc process therefore over oxidation can be effectively inhibited and wide range of ozone dosages was obtained during the hoc process which facilitate the application of the hoc process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords over oxidation hybrid ozonation coagulation process intermediate organic matter immediate complexation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction coagulation is often applied as the key process during the advanced treatment of wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent which can effectively remove particulate matter and colloidal substances li et al 2017 however a poor wwtp effluent organic matter efom removal performance is typically obtained using coagulation alone because of the existence of emerging contaminants and soluble microbial products which have a low coagulability qiu et al 2022 in addition wwtp effluent is one of the major sources of emerging contaminants which potentially affect aquatic organisms and threaten the sustainability of aquatic ecosystems tran et al 2018 therefore pre oxidation processes are employed to enhance the following coagulation performance and further improve the organic matter removal performance naceradska et al 2017 because of the strong oxidation ability and ease of handling ozonation has been widely used in the pre oxidation process yang et al 2017 pre ozonation can enhance dissolved organic matter removal by subsequent coagulation farvardin and collins 1989 sadrnourmohamadi and gorczyca 2015 for enhanced organic removal performance in the coagulation pre ozonation produces some hydrophobic neutral and intermediate molecular weight dissolved organic matter at suitable ozone dosages yan et al 2007 favorable pre ozonation can improve the concentration of oxygen containing functional groups such as carboxylic and hydroxyl groups which can interact and complex with hydrolysed coagulants to promote coagulation in ozonated waters reckhow et al 1986 nevertheless the so called suitable ozone dosages for pre ozonation to enhance subsequent coagulation are always very low liu et al 2021 yan et al 2007 reported that a low ozone dosage 1 0 mg l during the pre ozonation promoted organic matter removal in subsequent coagulation while a higher ozone dosage 2 0 mg l during pre ozonation adversely impacted organic matter removal chiang et al 2009 concluded that pre ozonation at a high ozone dosage e g 6 63 mgo3 l was not recommended for natural organic matter removal and the recommended ozone dosage was around 3 51 mgo3 l for optimal doc removal in subsequent coagulation our previous work also indicated that the humic acid removal efficiency can be improved by pre ozonation only at an ozone dosage range lower than 3 85 mg l hu et al 2021 therefore over oxidation frequently occurs when the ozone dosage is not strictly controlled due to the very narrow ozone dosage range and water quality fluctuations liu et al 2021 novotná et al 2020 more hydrophilic and lower molecular weight organic matter generation due to over oxidation results in low coagulability and complexation capability which are the main drawbacks of using pre ozonation coagulation process our previous studies proposed the hybrid ozonation coagulation hoc process in which ozonation and coagulation occurred simultaneously in one unit jin et al 2017 jin et al 2020 jin et al 2021b a higher efom removal efficiency can be obtained in the hoc process compared with pre ozonation coagulation jin et al 2017 jin et al 2020 in the hoc process hydrolysed metal coagulants act as ozone catalysts to enhance the generation of reactive oxygen species such as oh and o2 resulting in a stronger oxidation ability compared with ozonation alone jin et al 2019 theoretically more hydrophilic low molecular weight organic acids can be formed during the hoc reactions which inhibit the coagulation performance nevertheless the hoc process has a wider range of ozone dosages for improving organic matter removal 11 mgo3 l than the pre ozonation coagulation process 3 85 mgo3 l hu et al 2021 the influence of pre ozonation on subsequent coagulation is closely related to the characteristics and structure of organic matter matilainen et al 2010 hydrophobic organic matter with intermediate molecular weight and proper structure such as aromatic structures with carboxyl or hydroxyl groups facilitates coagulation song et al 2019 yan et al 2007 the mechanisms of organic matter removal by coagulation include a combination of entrapment charge neutralization adsorption and complexation with metal coagulants to form insoluble particulate aggregates matilainen et al 2010 however it is very difficult to directly take small hydrophilic organic matters from the dissolved state to the undissolved state by the above coagulation mechanisms zong et al 2022 therefore because the oxidation and coagulation occur simultaneously in the hoc process hydrolysed metal coagulants can immediately trap and complex with oxidized intermediate organics with appropriate structures once they are formed in other words the oxidized intermediate organic matter with proper structures hydrophobic and intermediate molecular weight dissolved organic matter with carboxyl or hydroxyl groups can be readily trapped and complexed by hydrolysed metal coagulants before they are oxidized into small hydrophilic acids however this hypothesis has not been verified and may be involved in the interactions between oxidation coagulation and organic matter in this study the organic matter removal efficiency of the hoc and pre ozonation coagulation process was compared over the same ozone dosage range and different initial ph values for the treatment of wwtp effluent to investigate the over oxidation inhibition phenomena in addition the proposed over oxidation inhibition mechanism of immediate entrapment and complexation between oxidized intermediate organics and metal coagulants during the hoc process was unveiled from the aspects of complexation and intermediate organic matter characterization 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents

performance of the pre ozonation coagulation and hoc processes the doc removal performance of the pre ozonation coagulation and hoc processes for the treatment of wwtp effluent at initial ph 5 and 7 was investigated fig 1 according to fig 1 for the pre ozonation coagulation process the maximum doc removal efficiency appeared at ozone dosages reacted ozone dosages of 0 1 and 1 3 mg l at initial ph 5 and 7 respectively with the corresponding doc removal efficiencies of 30 14 and 24 88 afterwards the doc removal efficiency decreased with increasing ozone dosage for the pre ozonation coagulation at both initial ph 5 and 7 when the ozone dosage exceeded 16 3 mg l 5 doc removal efficiency was obtained which was even lower than coagulation alone a similar result was also found by pei et al 2007 who reported that the toc removal efficiency increased from 23 to 38 with the increase of ozone dosage from 0 to 0 85 mg l in the pre ozonation process further increasing the ozone dosage did not increase the toc removal efficiency hu et al 2021 also found that with the ozone dosage range of 0 3 85 mg l the doc removal efficiency of the pre ozonation coagulation process was higher than that of coagulation process however the removal efficiency decreased when the ozone dosage exceeded 3 85 mg l the doc removal efficiency improvement at lower ozone dosages can be attributed to an increase in the number of oxygen containing functional groups such as carboxyl and hydroxyl of organic matter after pre ozonation li et al 2019 which improved the complexation between metal coagulants and organic matter song et al 2019 and further enhanced the coagulation performance chandrakanth and amy 1996 chen and yeh 2005 meanwhile the molecular weight and negative charge density of organic matter were reduced by ozonation at a low dosage which can effectively promote the destabilization of colloidal particles and improve the organic matter removal chandrakanth and amy 1996 xie et al 2013 furthermore the decreased doc removal efficiency at higher ozone dosages was due to the over oxidation of organic matter which converted high molecular organic matter into low molecular organic matter the accumulation of small molecular organic matter containing large amounts of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups produced by ozonation under high ozone dosage caused hydrophilicity and negative charge density increasing farvardin and collins 1989 xie et al 2016 which was not conducive to subsequent coagulation wang et al 1999 therefore for the pre ozonation process it is important to strictly control the ozone dosage within a narrow range therefore unstable and relatively low doc removal performance can be expected due to the over oxidation of organic matter especially during water quality variations in the hoc process within the tested ozone dosage range 0 58 mg l the doc removal efficiency was always higher at both initial ph 5 and 7 than that of coagulation alone fig 1 and pre ozonation alone fig s2 upon increasing the ozone dosage the doc removal efficiency slightly decreased but remained above 20 throughout the hoc process which is much higher than that of the pre ozonation coagulation process according to previous studies the interactions between ozone and hydroxyl groups on hydrolysed metal coagulant species surface can enhance the generation of ros such as oh during the hoc process jin et al 2017 jin et al 2019 jin et al 2020 meanwhile the presence of ozone can promote the formation of polymerized al species and accelerate the transformation of al species hydrolysis from low polymerized species to high polymerized species jin et al 2021a jin et al 2021b therefore the synergistic effects between ozonation and coagulation can promote both the oxidation and coagulation ability which enhanced the organic matter removal performance in the hoc process nevertheless ozone promoted the removal performance of the hoc process over a much wider ozone dosage range compared with pre ozonation coagulation process in the hoc system once the oxidized intermediate organic matter formed it will be readily trapped and complexed by the metal coagulant hydrolysed species this may be the reason why the over oxidation of organic matter can be inhibited during the hoc process with stronger oxidation ability based on fig 1 over oxidation of organic matter occurred in the pre ozonation coagulation process and completely inhibited the following coagulation when the ozone dosage was higher than 16 3 mg l for both initial ph 5 and 7 compared with the pre ozonation coagulation process the hoc process exhibited a higher doc removal efficiency and a wider ozone dosage range for improving the removal performance which resulted in stronger adaptability the ozone dosage of 16 3 mg l was the critical value for over oxidation in the pre ozonation coagulation process therefore 16 3 mg l was selected as the ozone dosage in the subsequent experiments to elucidate the over oxidation inhibition mechanism in this study 3 2 complexation characteristics of oxidized organic matter 3 2 1 zeta potential analysis the zeta potential analysis of the different processes is shown in fig 2 according to fig 2 a and b at low ozone dosages the zeta potential of organic matter increased after pre ozonation and then decreased with the increasing of ozone dosage as shown in fig 2 a the highest zeta potential of organic matter after pre ozonation reached 7 14 mv at an ozone dosage of 0 1 mg l at initial ph 5 when the ozone dosage exceeded 16 3 mg l the zeta potential was very low 12 mv a similar trend was observed at initial ph 7 where the highest zeta potential was 5 mv at an ozone dosage of 1 3 mg l and decreased below 15 mv at ozone dosages above 16 3 mg l fig 2 b when using a low ozone dosage during pre ozonation the zeta potential increased due to a decrease in the negative charge density chandrakanth and amy 1996 and the organic matter was oxidized appropriately farvardin and collins 1989 found a strong positive correlation between ozone dosage and charge density at ozone dosages lower than the optimal dosage of 0 3 mg l therefore the main mechanism by which pre ozonation process improved the coagulation performance at low concentration ozone oxidation was the reduction in the charge density of organic matter however adverse effect of ozonation on coagulation occurred at higher ozone dosages and the decreasing zeta potential was attributed to the over oxidation of organic matter hu et al 2021 which was the result of the accumulation of small molecular organic matter containing abundant carboxyl and hydroxyl groups chang et al 2002 fig 2 c also verified this phenomenon of over oxidation of organic matter at a low ozone dosage 0 1 mg l at ph 5 and 1 3 mg l at ph 7 the zeta potential increased continuously as the pre ozonation progressed while at a high ozone dosage 16 3 mg l the zeta potential decreased gradually in the middle and later stages of pre oxidation as shown in fig 2 d during the coagulation process after pre ozonation at initial ph 5 the zeta potential gradually increased at an ozone dosage of 0 1 mg l while the zeta potential varied only slightly at an ozone dosage of 16 3 mg l the main coagulation mechanism at initial ph 5 was mainly complexation between coagulants and organic matter naceradska et al 2019 the negative charge density was reduced after ozone oxidation at a low dosage which was beneficial to increase the opportunity for particle collisions and complexation during the subsequent coagulation process chandrakanth and amy 1996 xie et al 2016 xie et al 2013 therefore the zeta potential gradually increased during subsequent coagulation at an ozone dosage of 0 1 mg l however the zeta potential was low after ozonation at high ozone dosages and it was difficult for organic matter to be complexed and precipitated chang et al 2002 which reduced the doc removal efficiency the zeta potential of organic matter changed little in the subsequent coagulation process either at low or high ozone dosages at initial ph 7 that was because sweep flocculation was the main coagulation mechanism at initial ph 7 prokopova et al 2021 and organic matter was removed by the adsorption of al oh 3 s duan and gregory 2003 according to fig 2 a and b the zeta potentials at initial ph 5 and ph 7 at the end of reactions during the hoc process at different ozone dosages were about 2 and 8 mv respectively which were favorable conditions for the coagulation process chekli et al 2017 meanwhile as shown in fig 2 d and e throughout the hoc process the zeta potential continuously increased indicating that complexation between organic matter and metal coagulants persisted in the hoc process jin et al 2018 the synergistic effects between ozonation and coagulation during the hoc process made metal coagulants act as catalyst to catalyze ozone to generate oh as well as coagulants to complex with organic matters which were modified by oh oxidation jin et al 2019 jin et al 2021b the epr spectra of the pre ozonation process and hoc process fig s3 proved that more oh was generated during the hoc process indicating that the hoc process had a stronger oxidation ability than the pre ozonation process in the hoc process with stronger oxidation ability the oxidized intermediate organic matter formed by the hoc reactions did not accumulate but was immediately trapped and complexed by the hydrolysed species of metal coagulants which was manifested as a stable increase in the zeta potential in fig 2 d and e 3 2 2 synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy analysis the complexation of organic matter and metal coagulants is often manifested as fluorescence enhancement or quenching chen et al 2015 variations in the fluorescence intensity during the coagulation process can be observed in fig 3 a and b the fluorescence intensity decreased after complexation between organic matter and metal coagulants during the coagulation process at both initial ph 5 and ph 7 moreover a greater decrease was found at initial ph 5 than that at initial ph 7 a similar result was also found by jin et al 2018 who reported that al organic ligand complexation resulted in fluorescence quenching therefore the complexation between organic matter and hydrolysed coagulants species was dominant at initial ph 5 because the main mechanism of coagulation at ph 5 was charge neutralization duan and gregory 2003 however for initial ph 7 the complexation was not obvious which implied that the sweep flocculation between al oh 3 s produced by hydrolysis and organic matter was the main coagulation mechanism righetto et al 1991 according to fig s4 the maximum fluorescence intensity was observed at 1 min complexation after pre ozonation therefore 1 min was selected as the complexation time after pre ozonation and hoc quenching meanwhile adding coagulants to the pre ozonation coagulation system and hoc system at the end of the reaction did not further increase the doc removal efficiency which verified the 10 mg l coagulants added at the beginning of the reaction was sufficient for the whole process fig s5 as shown in fig 3 c and d complexation between the formed oxidized intermediate organic matter by the pre ozonation process and coagulants increased the fluorescence intensity due to the complexation during the coagulation process at initial ph 5 instead of a coagulation process dominated by sweep flocculation at initial ph 7 duan and gregory 2003 prokopova et al 2021 the fluorescence intensity increase was more significant at initial ph 5 than that at initial ph 7 when the ozone oxidation time was less than 3 min the fluorescence intensity was enhanced after complexation when the ozone oxidation time exceeded 3 min the fluorescence intensity was also higher than that after pre ozonation but the increased amplitude did not change as the reactions progressed this indicated that with the increase of ozone oxidation time the degree of complexation between organic matter and coagulants did not increase that may be caused by the over oxidation of organic matter which lead to the accumulation of low molecular weight organic matter that was difficult to be complexed with coagulants chu et al 2020 according to fig s6 when the ozone oxidation time was 15 min at an ozone dosage of 16 3 mg l the doc removal efficiency in the subsequent coagulation process was always very low at both initial ph 5 and ph 7 therefore when the ozonation time exceeded 3 min the low molecular weight organic matter and oxygen containing groups generated by ozone oxidation began to accumulate xie et al 2016 and the doc removal efficiency in the coagulation process was greatly limited when ozonation time reached 15 min which was consistent with the zeta potential analysis in fig 2 c fig 3 e and f show that when the hoc reaction time was less than 1 min the fluorescence intensity increased in the subsequent 1 min complexation process after the reactive oxygen species were quenched that indicated complexation between intermediate organic matter and hydrolysed coagulant species occurred in the subsequent 1 min complexation process when the hoc reaction time exceeded 1 min the fluorescence intensity remained unchanged during the following 1 min complexation indicating complexation reactions between intermediate organic matter and hydrolysed coagulant species were limited at this time jin et al 2021b found that in the hoc process ozone reacted with organic matter in the first minute and then reacted with the hydroxyl groups on hydrolysed metal coagulant species surface to form oh therefore in the first 1 min of the hoc process organic matter was more likely to react with ozone rather than be trapped and complexed via coagulation in the subsequent complexation process after the reactive oxygen species were quenched the intermediate organic matter formed by ozonation in the system began to complex with the hydrolysed coagulant species which was verified as an increase in the fluorescence intensity after 1 min reaction during the hoc process because the intermediate organic matter formed by ozone and oh oxidation was removed through immediate entrapment and complexation by hydrolysed species there was no excess intermediate organic matter to complex with the hydrolysed coagulant species in the subsequent complexation process this was verified by the unchanged fluorescence intensity meanwhile the variation of the doc removal efficiency during the pre ozonation coagulation and hoc reaction showed that organic matter was gradually removed throughout the hoc process fig s6 which further confirmed that the intermediate organic matter was trapped and removed after being produced by the hydrolysed coagulant species during the hoc reaction 3 2 3 ft ir analysis changes in the functional groups involved in complexation in different processes were analyzed by ft ir spectroscopy the oh and cooh were the main functional groups that complexed with metal coagulants li et al 2018 the peak at 3410 cm 1 corresponded to the stretching vibration of oh groups machado et al 2020 and the peaks at 1645 cm 1 and 1384 cm 1 corresponded to the asymmetric stretching vibrations c o and the symmetric stretching vibrations c o of coo groups respectively liu et al 2022 fig s7 shows the ft ir spectra of the supernatant and flocs during the coagulation process at initial ph 5 and 7 as the coagulation process progressed the intensity of the characteristic peaks of the oh and coo groups in the supernatant decreased gradually at both initial ph 5 and 7 which was due to the complexation of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups with coagulants song et al 2019 however the peak intensities of oh and coo in flocs did not vary significantly which may be attributed to the limited removal efficiency of organic matter in the coagulation process zong et al 2022 and the ineffective transfer of organic matter into flocs fig 4 a and b show the ft ir spectra of the supernatant in the pre ozonation process at an ozone dosage of 16 3 mg l the intensity of characteristic peaks belonging to oh and coo gradually increased with the increase of ozonation time at both initial ph 5 and ph 7 because ozonation increased the number of oxygen containing groups huang et al 2020 li et al 2019 however during the subsequent coagulation the characteristic peak intensities of oh and coo in the supernatant decreased in the early stage and remained unchanged in the later stage fig 4 c and d this indicated that complexation between organic matter and coagulants only occurred in the early stage of coagulation process despite the generation of more complexation active sites meanwhile fig 4 e and f show that the characteristic peaks of oh and coo in the flocs increased only during the early stage of the reaction and remained almost unchanged in the later stage this confirmed that the organic matter was not effectively transferred to flocs during the subsequent coagulation of the pre ozonation process at an ozone dosage of 16 3 mg l because of the difficulties in complexation with coagulants this may be attributed to the over oxidation of organic matter at a high ozone dosage of 16 3 mg l hu et al 2021 which was not conducive to complexation during the coagulation chang et al 2002 as shown in fig 5 a and c during the hoc process the intensities of the characteristic peak of oh and coo in the supernatant increased slightly in the first 1 min and decreased continuously in the later stage during the hoc process ozone preferentially reacted with organic matter in the first 1 min jin et al 2021b which increased the content of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups huang et al 2020 after 1 min ozone interacted with the coagulants to produce oh jin et al 2020 and the generated intermediate organic matter complexed with the hydrolysed coagulant species immediately which was manifested by the continuous decrease in the characteristic peak intensity of oh and coo meanwhile the intensity of the characteristic peaks belonging to oh and coo in the flocs increased gradually fig 5 b and fig 5 d this indicated that the reactive oxygen species produced during the hoc process promoted the generation of more oxygen containing functional groups and they can be effectively trapped by hydrolysed coagulant species into flocs hu et al 2021 which further proved that the complexation between intermediate organic matter and hydrolysed coagulants was instantaneous in addition the content of carboxyl groups which were typical complexation active sites with metal coagulants was measured by the modified boehm titration method liu et al 2022 wu et al 2022 the content of carboxyl groups in the flocs during the different processes at ozone dosage of 16 3 mg l at initial ph 5 and 7 can be seen in fig s8 the results were consistent with the ft ir results fig 4 fig 5 and fig s7 which further proved that the existence of immediate entrapment and complexation between intermediate organic matter and coagulants promoted the effective transfer of organic matter to flocs and inhibited the over oxidation of organic matter in the hoc process 3 3 transformation of oxidized intermediate organic matter 3 3 1 intermediate organic matter analysis as shown in figs 6 and 7 the transformation of oxidized intermediate organic matter during different processes was analyzed by uplc q tof ms in this study organic matter was divided into three categories i e c1 10 c11 20 and c21 and their cumulative abundance in supernatant and flocs at initial ph 5 and 7 during the hoc reactions are shown in fig 6 a and fig 6 b at both initial ph 5 and 7 the cumulative abundance of c11 c20 and c21 in the supernatant decreased as the hoc reactions progressed while the cumulative abundance of c1 c10 exhibited limited variations meanwhile it was also observed that the cumulative abundance of c11 c20 increased significantly in the flocs as the hoc reactions progressed while the cumulative abundance of c1 c10 and c21 did not vary significantly to further explain the variations in intermediate organic matter during the hoc process a catalytic ozonation system γ al2o3 o3 was established as a comparison which produced the same amount of oh as the hoc process fig s9 as shown in fig 6 c and fig 6 d in the catalytic system at initial ph 5 and 7 the cumulative abundance of c11 c20 and c21 gradually decreased as the reactions progressed while the cumulative abundance of c1 c10 increased this indicated that in the γ al2o3 o3 system which had the same oxidation ability as the hoc system c11 c20 and c21 tended to be oxidized and decomposed into low carbon number organic matter c1 c10 su et al 2022 therefore the decrease in the c21 content in the supernatant during the hoc process should tend to be oxidized into low carbon number organic matter c1 c10 however when c21 organic matter was decomposed into c11 c20 it was more likely to be trapped and removed by hydrolysed coagulant species immediately in the hoc system rather than continue to be oxidized and decomposed into c1 c10 therefore the organic matter in the flocs was mainly distributed in c11 c20 according to the ft ir spectra fig 5 increased organics with oh and cooh groups were observed in flocs during the hoc process indicating that the c11 c20 transferred to flocs during the hoc process was rich in oh and cooh groups which was conducive to coagulation the organic matter obtained by uplc q tof ms analysis was mainly distributed in the range between m z 200 and 400 tables s2 s9 and the distribution of organic matter between m z 200 and 400 in the hoc process is shown in fig 7 in the negative ion mode for example the intensities of c21h34o3 c21h26n2o3 c21h22o5 and c26h36o3 in the supernatant at initial ph 5 fig 7 c and the intensities of c21h34o3 c22h28o3 and c26h36o3 in the supernatant at initial ph 7 fig 7 g decreased as hoc reactions progressed however they did not appear in the flocs fig 7 d and h which indicated that they were oxidized and decomposed rather than trapped and removed by the hydrolysed coagulant species at the same time organic matter such as c15h22o3 c16h14o3 and c15h14o6 at initial ph 5 and c13h14o3 c14h24o2 and c11h16n2o3 at initial ph 7 which did not exist in the supernatant appeared in the flocs this can be attributed to the formation of intermediate organic matter from high carbon organic matter which was readily trapped by metal coagulants the same phenomenon was observed in positive ion mode fig 7 a b e and f indicating that c21 was oxidized and decomposed into c11 c20 and intermediate organic matter of c11 c20 was trapped and complexed by hydrolysed coagulant species as soon as they formed 3 3 2 xps analysis xps was used to further analyze the transformation characteristics of intermediate organic matter in the supernatant and flocs during the different processes the c1s spectra in the γ al2o3 o3 process and hoc process are shown in fig s10 fig s12 the four peaks at 284 76 ev 285 44 ev 286 17 ev and 288 67 ev were assigned to c c c h and aromatic c c o c o and ho c o respectively huang et al 2020 according to fig 8 a and b in the γ al2o3 o3 process as the reactions progressed the proportion of oxygen containing functional groups at initial ph 5 and 7 gradually increased reaching 55 93 and 56 28 respectively after 15 min reaction this can be attributed to the oxidation of ozone and oh xue et al 2022 which also indicated that organic matter tended to be transformed into low carbon organic matter containing more oxygen containing functional groups during the γ al2o3 o3 process however in the hoc process with the same oh content as the γ al2o3 o3 process the percentage of oxygen containing functional groups in the system increased at both initial ph 5 and 7 after 1 min reaction fig 8 c and d this was because organic matter tended to be oxidized by ozone in the first 1 min of the hoc reactions jin et al 2021b resulting in the production of more oxygen containing functional groups huang et al 2020 after 1 min reactions in the hoc process the ratio of oxygen containing functional groups and aliphatic carbon aromatic carbon did not vary significantly in the supernatant and the same phenomenon was observed in the flocs fig 8 c and d during the hoc process organic matter was oxidized to intermediate organic matter that contained many oxygen containing functional groups due to oxidation by ozone and oh jin et al 2022 this intermediate organic matter was trapped by hydrolysed coagulant species into flocs immediately after formation aliphatic carbon aromatic carbon and oxygen containing functional groups were synchronously transferred from solution to flocs which was manifested by an insignificant variation in their ratio these results further confirmed that after 1 min reaction in the hoc process intermediate organic matter of c11 c20 produced by the oxidation of organic matter by reactive oxygen species had a higher content of oxygen containing functional groups their further oxidation and decomposition were blocked by the entrapment and complexation process after the formation of c11 c20 they were trapped readily during the flocculation by the hydrolysed coagulant species 3 4 proposed over oxidation inhibition mechanism within the hoc process based on the results described above the over oxidation inhibition mechanism within the hoc process was verified which involved the immediate entrapment and complexation between hydrolysed coagulants and oxidized intermediate organic matter fig 9 in the hoc process ozone oxidation and coagulation of organic matter occurred in the same system jin et al 2017 the interactions between ozone and hydroxyl groups on hydrolysed metal coagulant species surface enhanced the oh generation jin et al 2020 ozone reacted preferentially with organic matter in the first 1 min of hoc reaction jin et al 2021b and then the intermediate organic matter formed by ozone oxidation was trapped and removed by coagulation fig 3 after 1 min the reaction between ozone and coagulants began and a large amount of oh was generated fig s3 at this time organic matter was further oxidized and decomposed by oh and ozone when the high carbon organic matter c21 was decomposed into c11 c20 the pathway of further oxidation of c11 c20 to c1 c10 was blocked due to the immediate entrapment and complexation by metal coagulants and c11 c20 gradually accumulated in the flocs fig 6 and fig 7 this reaction process occurred immediately which prevented the accumulation of small hydrophilic organic matter during the hoc process meanwhile the formed c11 c20 intermediate organic matter by ozone and oh oxidation was rich in complexing active functional groups of oh and coo figs 5 and 6 which made it easier for them to be immediately trapped and complexed by coagulants after their formation xie et al 2016 subsequently due to the continuous immediate entrapment and complexation of organic matter by coagulants the negative charge density of the hoc system decreased gradually fig 2 d and e which was more conducive to the immediate entrapment and complexation therefore the over oxidation of organic matter in the hoc process was inhibited and the hoc process exhibited a higher and more stable organic matter removal efficiency over a wider range of ozone dosages than the pre ozonation coagulation process 4 conclusion the traditional pre ozonation coagulation process had improved doc removal efficiency only at the ozone dosage of 0 16 3 mg l for the treatment of wwtp effluent with respect to coagulation alone when the ozone dosage increased 16 3 mg l the doc removal efficiency was lower than coagulation alone due to over oxidation in contrast the hoc process exhibited improved doc removal performance compared with coagulation over a much wider ozone dosage range of 0 58 mg l with an even higher oxidation ability through zeta potential analysis over oxidation in the pre ozonation coagulation process led to the excessive accumulation of small molecular organic matter at high ozone dosages which reduced the zeta potential and inhibited subsequent coagulation during the hoc reactions the zeta potential continued to rise combined with the synchronous fluorescence analysis the entrapment and complexation of intermediate organic matter and coagulants occurred continuously and immediately which inhibited the over oxidation of organic matter based on the ft ir and uplc q tof ms analysis a large amount of c11 c20 intermediate organic matter rich in oxygen containing functional groups accumulated in the flocs which was generated through the decomposition of high carbon organic matter c21 by oxidation this c11 c21 intermediate organic matter was trapped and removed by coagulants immediately after being produced instead of continuing to be oxidized to c1 c10 organics the immediate simultaneous transfer of aliphatic aromatic carbon and oxygen containing functional groups from solution to flocs was confirmed by xps analysis as a consequence the immediate entrapment and complexation between hydrolysed coagulants and oxidized intermediate organic matter inhibited the over oxidation of organic matter and widened the range of ozone dosages in the hoc process declaration of competing interest the

15051,microplastics mps particles bring potential threats to the aqueous environment and the coexistence of natural organic matter nom enhances their toxicity coagulation is an efficient method for particle removal and exploring the binding sites and modes of the coagulant hydrolysates with mps in the presence of nom is essential to understand the coagulation mechanism in this study a novel polymerized polyaluminum titanium chloride composite coagulant patc was prepared and used to remove polystyrene ps it was found that patc could compress or even destroy the surface layer of the negatively charged ps in comparison to pac and ptc patc was more efficient in decreasing the energy barrier of the ps particles and increasing their aggregation rate over a wider ph range the results of the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo calculation revealed that the interaction between the hydrolysates of patc and ps was mainly polar interaction vab such as hydrogen bonding the peak intensity and peak shift in fourier transformed infrared ftir and x ray photoelectron spectra xps were analyzed to further explore the interaction between the hydrolysates of patc and ps it was found that hydrogen bonding existed between the oh group of patc and the aliphatic c h and c o groups of ps and the main interaction between ha and ps was the π π conjugation and hydrogen bonding between the cooh oh and c o groups of ha and the c o and aliphatic c h groups of ps therefore in the ha ps system the active sites of ha e g cooh and oh and ps e g c o and aliphatic c h binding with the coagulants were occupied which accordingly led to the dramatic decline in the removal efficiency of both ha and ps in actual lake water treatment although the removal efficiency of ps was significantly poor patc performed better for ps removal than pac and ptc besides the effluent ph was maintained at 6 81 0 08 which met the requirements of the subsequent water treatment process this study provides systematic knowledge for understanding the interaction between ps nom and coagulant hydrolysates and further confirms the application potential of patc for mps removal graphical

request 1 introduction plastic products are mass produced and widely applied owing to their durability ease of production lightweight and low cost gong et al 2022 yang et al 2022 on a global scale an estimated 9 23 million metric tons of plastic waste are produced every year and the aquatic environment is polluted through wastewater and urban runoffs besseling et al 2017 zhang et al 2022 in the aqueous environment some large size plastics are decomposed into microplastics mps 1 μm 5 mm and nanoplastics nps 1 μm by photodegradation yang et al 2022 oxidation wu et al 2022 biodegradation andrady 2011 hydrolysis li et al 2018 and thermal degradation huangfu et al 2019 water pollution caused by mps has attracted widespread concern due to their large surface area high surface activity and easy bioavailability peydayesh et al 2021 natural organic matter nom widely existing in surface water can combine with toxic compounds to adversely affect the environment liu et al 2021 peydayesh et al 2021 the toxicity and ecological activity of the complexes formed by mps and nom are stronger and more variable than the single pollutants liu et al 2021 rainieri et al 2018 humic acid ha as a typical nom has large amounts of functional groups and binding sites song et al 2019 which is easy to combine with pesticides and mps liu et al 2019 the interaction between ha and mps will change the physicochemical properties of ha and mps including hydrophobicity electronegativity particle size and functional groups cai et al 2018 therefore the ha mps complexes are more difficult to be removed than the single ha or mps lu et al 2021 considering the high toxicity and risk of the ha mps complexes the development of control strategies and technologies to remove ha mps complexes has become a research priority coagulation is a widely used water treatment technology due to its low cost and high efficiency which has been studied extensively in removing mps ho et al 2022 ramirez arenas et al 2022 xu et al 2021 traditional coagulants such as aluminum al and iron fe salts have some shortages i low efficiency in removing mps ii health risks or economic burdens caused by residual al and coagulation sludge iii unacceptable color and odor of effluent after fe coagulation du et al 2021 gan et al 2021a ma et al 2019a ma et al 2019b zhang et al 2020 in recent years titanium ti based coagulants have shown better performance in removing micropollutants and nom compared with al fe coagulants gan et al 2021c however single ti based coagulant has some drawbacks in use such as poor stability sensitivity to water quality and extremely low effluent ph gan et al 2021a although prehydrolysis can overcome these defects of the single ti based salts the polymerized ti coagulants are still prone to further hydrolysis during storage guo et al 2022 liu et al 2022b composite metal coagulants can cover the shortages of single metal salts guo et al 2022 in our previous work we prepared a highly polymerized aluminum titanium chloride composite coagulant patc by pre hydrolysis and confirmed its high efficiency in ha kaolin simulated water treatment liu et al 2022a it was found that the hydrolysates of patc showed a flower like structure which had higher surface charge density and more binding sites than those of polyaluminum chloride pac and polytitanium chloride ptc liu et al 2022b accordingly patc is expected to be efficient in removing mps and ha mps complexes nevertheless to the best of our knowledge few studies on the remediation of mps contaminated water using patc the overall performance and underlying mechanisms of patc to treat mps contaminated water remain unclear in addition the complexity of the actual water body mainly the coexisting nom can affect the aggregation behavior of mps della torre et al 2014 xu et al 2021 however the efficiency and mechanism of patc for mps removal with the coexistence of organic matter have not been systematically investigated to address the above issues the overall objective of this paper was to evaluate the coagulation performance and mechanism of patc in removing mps from the natural water pac and ptc were taken as the comparison polystyrene ps is one of the most widely used plastics worldwide due to its versatility and nonbiodegradability della torre et al 2014 mark a browne et al 2008 which was used to represent mps in this study the specific objectives of this work were to i study the performance of pac ptc and patc in removing ps ii investigate the interaction mechanism between the coexisting nom and ps particles iii explore the coagulation mechanism of patc for ps removal from the perspective of the interaction between ps nom and the hydrolysates of coagulants based on the theoretical calculations and chemical characterization this work will provide new insight into the interaction between the hydrolysates of coagulants mps and nom 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and test

water was collected in july at shandong university in qingdao shandong province china the latitude and longitude of the sampling site were 120 68 and 36 37 respectively before each set of experiments

5 detailed preparation methods for pac and ptc are described in supplementary information si 2 3 coagulation experiments the coagulation tests were conducted with a 250 ml glass beaker on a standard jar test apparatus zr4 6 zhongrun water industry technology development co ltd china hcl 1 m and naoh 1 m solutions were used to adjust the ph of the water sample before the experiments batch experiments were carried out in four stages i firstly the test water was stirred rapidly at 200 rpm for 30 s ii next the coagulants were added into the jars and stirred at 200 rpm for 40 s iii and then the stirring speed was adjusted to 50 rpm and kept for 20 min iv finally the mixture was settled without stirring for30 min for the single ps system ps concentration was measured by a total organic carbon analyzer toc vcph shimadzu japan and a turbidimeter 2100 q hach us respectively toc values were used as the main indicator to quantify ps concentration in this study peydayesh et al 2021 skaf et al 2020 the supernatant after coagulation was collected and used directly without filtration for toc turbidity and zeta potential zetasizer nano malvern instruments uk assays gong et al 2022 hong et al 2021 test methods for organic matter concentration and turbidity of ha actual lake water can be found in section s2 for ha actual lake water ps composite system separate quantification of ha and ps using a customized approach the supernatant after filtration through a 0 45 μm aqueous polyethersulfone membrane was used to determine uv254 and dissolved organic carbon doc which represented the residual organic matters after coagulation moreover specific uv absorbance suva was used to further characterize the hydrophilicity of the contaminates before and after coagulation the specific calculation is shown in section s2 the ps was quantified using the following procedures i accurate 40 ml supernatant was taken 2 cm below the water surface and the target supernatant was acidified with hcl 1 m for 2 h to remove flocs from the ps surface lu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 ii the target solution was filtered using a 0 45 μm glass fiber membrane iii ps trapped on the membrane was rinsed with di water iv and then the membrane was sonicated for 2 min to ensure that ps was completely rinsed off v finally the toc concentration of the solution was measured the results of the recovery rate and applicability of the method are shown in fig s1 2 4 characterization of ps and flocs the average hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential of ps under different ph conditions were measured by dynamic light scattering dls with a zetasizer nano zs instrument zhang et al 2012 the polydispersity index pdi value is calculated as follows gong et al 2022 1 pdi σ 2 z d 2 where σ and zd represent the standard deviation and average hydrodynamic diameter respectively a contact angle system spca x1 harke was employed for contact angle measurement the morphology of ps before coagulation was observed using scanning electron microscopy sem tescan mira4 the coagulated flocs were collected and vacuum dried in a freeze dryer for sem and transmission electron microscope tem fei tecnai g2 f20 analysis the surface functional groups of ps ha and ha ps before and after coagulation were characterized by fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy ftir thermo scientific nicolet in10 and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo scientific k alpha the details about the ftir and xps characterization methods are shown in the si 2 5 data analysis and theoretical calculation the t test and correlation analysis were performed separately in origin 2022 the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory states that the total interaction energy vtotal includes van der waals attraction energy vvdw electrical repulsion energy vedl and lewis acid base interaction energy vab zhang et al 2022 the vtotal potential energy curves can be used to predict the aggregation behavior of particles which can explain the ps coagulation mechanism dong et al 2021 gong et al 2022 detailed information about the calculations is provided in section s5 aggregation tests were determined using time resolved dls mastersizer 3000 malvern uk the hydrodynamic diameter dh was monitored immediately after adding the coagulant a complete autocorrelation function was recorded every 30 s and lasted for 5 min the aggregation rate was the slope of dh versus time ddh dt which was obtained by the linear least squares regression analysis over the time range of aggregation initiation t0 to the time when dh over 1 50 dh 0 bouchard et al 2012 gong et al 2022 the specific calculations are exhibited in the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 interactions between ha and ps ps mps are regular spheres with relatively uniform particle size distribution and an average hydrodynamic diameter of 5 0 0 2 μm fig 1 a d the adsorption of ha on the surface of ps led to a rough surface and a wide particle size distribution fig 1 chen et al 2018 the pdi value of ps suspension was 0 021 less than 0 200 which indicated that ps mps were stably dispersed in water without obvious aggregation gong et al 2022 izquierdo et al 2005 however the addition of ha led to a significant increase in the pdi value 0 634 which indicated that ha ps particles had poor dispersion in comparison to the ps particles the particles with poor dispersion and wide particle size distribution were difficult to remove besides the stability of ps was greatly influenced by the presence of ha chen et al 2018 the stability of the colloids can be elucidated by the xdlvo theory wang et al 2020 the primary energy barrier φmax of the ha ps particle was significantly higher than that of pure ha and ps fig 2 a c which implied that the ha ps particles were more stable and required more kinetic energy to overcome the interparticle repulsion to aggregate cai et al 2018 moreover the addition of ha increased the electronegativity of the particle surface fig 2 d which enhanced the stability of the particles and resulted in an increase in inter particle repulsion mao et al 2020 as shown in fig 1 g i the water contact angle wca of ps exceeded 90 which indicated its relatively hydrophobic adsorption surface the ha ps showed a lower wca than ps indicating that the interaction between ha and ps enhanced the surface hydrophilicity of ps based on the above findings the removal efficiency of the ps particles would be decreased in the ha ps composite system the change of the chemical bonds caused by the interaction between ha and ps was confirmed by ftir fig 2 g basically no significant change was observed in the ftir spectra after the combination of ha and ps which demonstrated that noncovalent interplay dominated the interaction between ha and ps rather than the formation of covalent bonds xiong et al 2020 xps was used to further analyze the interaction mechanism between ha and ps it was found that the c o 531 7 ev and oh 532 6 ev groups in ha ps moved toward the high binding energy be li et al 2021 which was due to the cooh oh and c o groups of ha could interact with ps as the electron donating groups chen et al 2018 after interaction with ha the hydrogen bond between ha and ps led to the appearance of the oh o co subpeak at 532 8 ev fig 2 e xiong et al 2020 as shown in fig 2 f four characteristic peaks at 284 4 285 1 286 3 and 289 1 ev were observed in the c1s spectra which represented aromatic ch aliphatic ch c o and π π interaction respectively lin et al 2020 xiong et al 2020 the be of c o and aliphatic ch of ps shifted to the low direction fig 2 e f which was an indicator that electron transfer occurred between ha and ps xiong et al 2020 this result suggested that the c o and aliphatic ch groups of ps might be the active sites to interact with ha remarkably the peak of the π π bond moved from 289 1 ev to 288 7 ev which further confirmed that the π π conjugation existed between ps and ha xiong et al 2020 moreover the suva value of ha ps was smaller than that of ha table s2 which indicated that the relative content of the unsaturated bonds and aromatic compounds of ha was reduced after interacting with ps kellerman et al 2018 accordingly it was inferred that the unsaturated bonds or polycyclic aromatic compounds of ha preferred to bind with ps particles based on the above results an interaction pathway between ha and ps was proposed fig 2 h specifically the benzene ring of ps first contacted the aromatic structure of ha via π π conjugation and then the c o and aliphatic ch of ps interacted with the cooh oh and c o groups of ha by hydrogen bonding to form a highly conjugated copolymer 3 2 interaction between ps and coagulants 3 2 1 effect of ph ph can affect coagulation efficiency and mechanism by influencing the stability of ps and the transformation of coagulant hydrolysates gong et al 2022 the settling performance of ps at different ph conditions was investigated fig s2 which showed that the settling rate of ps could be ignored 0 36 7 66 in the ph range of 2 to 10 as shown in fig 3 a b with the increase of ph ptc showed a decreasing efficiency in removing ps when pac or patc was added the removal efficiency of ps exhibited a trend of first increasing and then decreasing as the ph increased and ph 6 and ph 7 were the inflection points respectively after coagulation treatment the φmax of ps was significantly reduced which demonstrated that the addition of coagulants led to the destabilization and aggregation of ps fig 3 c e lower secondary minimum φsec depth indicated that the particles tended to aggregate and settle more easily zhang et al 2022 the φsec of ps was positively correlated with ph after the addition of the coagulants so the aggregation rate of ps should theoretically decrease with the increase of ph however the experimental results showed that the aggregation rate of ps first increased and then decreased as the ph increased fig 3 c h this discrepancy suggested that other important mechanisms were involved in ps removal except for van der waals attraction energy electrical repulsion energy and lewis acid base interaction energy previous studies showed that the introduced mn m refers to al or ti could be adsorbed on the ps surface which made the surface of ps exhibit electrostatic heterogeneity cai et al 2018 gong et al 2022 however in the xdlvo theory only the average value of the particle surface charges was used neglecting the heterogeneity of the interacting surfaces valmacco et al 2016 therefore xdlvo theory cannot accurately predict the complex interaction forces between the multiple coagulant hydrolysates and ps under different ph conditions the interaction mechanism between the coagulants and ps under different ph conditions was mainly related to the coagulant hydrolysates zhang et al 2022 the hydrolysis polymerization of ptc was too fast therefore its charge neutralization ability was strong under acidic conditions gan et al 2021b but under neutral alkaline conditions the charge of its hydrolysates turned negative fig s3 the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged hydrolysates of ptc and ps particles was enhanced fig 3 b which correspondingly decreased the aggregation rate of ps particles and ultimately reduced their removal efficiency with the increase of ph pac could first hydrolyze to produce positively charged polynuclear hydroxyl complexes and then form amorphous hydroxides with poor charge neutralization ability zhao et al 2011 as shown in fig 3 b when the ph increased from 2 to 6 and further to 10 the zeta potential of flocs formed by pac increased from 0 32 mv to 0 759 mv and then decreased to 3 97 mv remarkably the aggregation rate and removal efficiency of ps by adding pac showed the same tendency as the zeta potentials of flocs the phenomenon indicated that the change of the surface charge caused by mn dominated the particles aggregation behavior cai et al 2018 patc was mainly presented as monomeric positive hydrolysates under acidic conditions such as al oh 2o tio and al oh 2tio3 liu et al 2022b with the increase of ph highly polymerized positive hydrolysates of patc e g al oh 3 am tio oh 2 am al13 and al2 oh 2o2ti oh 2 2 became dominant liu et al 2022b these polymers could neutralize the negatively charged ps which led to the destabilization of ps thus as the ph increased from 2 to 7 the zeta potential of the flocs after patc coagulation changed from 0 27 mv to 4 02 mv after 5 min the hydrodynamic diameter increased dramatically from 4 μm to 728 μm fig 3 which further improved the aggregation rate from 0 06 μm s ph 2 to 2 48 μm s ph 7 and removal efficiency of ps table s3 when ph reached 10 amorphous hydroxides of patc dominated the coagulation process the zeta potential of flocs decreased to 2 82 mv and the corresponding hydrodynamic diameter was reduced to 630 μm thereby resulting in a decrease in aggregation rate 1 76 μm s and ps removal 11 65 fig 3 3 2 2 effect of coagulant considering that the ph of the actual surface water was weakly alkaline so the coagulation mechanism of different coagulants to remove ps was analyzed at ph 8 as shown in fig 4 b the φmax of ps decreased to 2 75 4 65 and 1 11 kt after the coagulation with pac ptc and patc respectively thus compared with pac and ptc patc was more effective in weakening the electrostatic repulsive forces among the ps particles and promoting their heteroaggregation oriekhova and stoll 2018 for pac and patc the absolute value of the floc zeta potential had a strong correlation with the ps removal pearson s r 0 88 and 0 83 which indicated that the ps removal might be dominated by the charge neutralization rajala et al 2020 in the case of ptc the above correlation was poor pearson s r 0 20 which indicated that the removal mechanism of ps by ptc might be sweep flocculation or a combination of sweep flocculation and charge neutralization rather than the single charge neutralization rajala et al 2020 entrapment of coagulant hydrolysates around multiple spheres based on electrostatic adsorption and sweeping was visible in sem fig 4 i k and tem images fig s4 the interaction energy between ps and the coagulants was analyzed by xdlvo theory vvdw vedl and hydrodynamic forces are considered the main factors for collision between particles and coagulants guo et al 2020 since the suspension was stationary during settling hydrodynamic forces were neglected and vvdw vedl and vab were assumed to be the dominant forces zhang et al 2022 the data in table s1 showed that after coagulation the value of vab was positive while that of vedl and vvdw were negative no matter which type of coagulant was used it demonstrated that vab interaction was repulsive while vedl and vvdw interactions were attractive in coagulation tian et al 2017 when the hydrolysates of the coagulants approached ps particles they not only experienced attractive energy but also needed to overcome repulsive interaction energy besides the results in table s1 showed that the values of vab were significantly higher than those of vedl and vvdw which implied that the influence of vab on the total interaction energy composition was more significant than that of vedl and vvdw furthermore this result indicated that polar interaction played a more important role in ps removal than van der waals attraction energy and electrical repulsion energy at short distances it was due to that polar interaction determined the energy barrier strength of ps and thus affected the ps removal the chemical interaction between the coagulants and ps was further analyzed by ftir and xps analysis the ftir spectra of the coagulated flocs in fig 4 c show that the peak of the hydrogen bond at 3370 cm 1 became stronger than the virgin ps which implied that the hydrogen bonding force was involved in the interaction between the coagulants and ps he et al 2022 liu et al 2022c xps spectra in fig 4 e exhibited that the subpeak of oh o co at 532 8 ev was a sign of hydrogen bonding xiong et al 2020 and the appearance of this peak indicated the presence of hydrogen bonding in the coagulation process after patc coagulation the peak intensity of the hydrogen bond was the strongest among the three coagulation systems which demonstrated that the hydrogen bonding force in patc coagulation was stronger than that in pac and ptc coagulation xps spectra in fig 4 e showed that after coagulation the c o bond of ps moved to the direction of low be which indicated that the electron cloud density of o atoms increased guo et al 2022 the above phenomenon was caused by the formation of the hydrogen bond between the oh of the coagulants and the c o groups of ps moreover compared with pac and ptc patc coagulation caused a more obvious displacement of the peak of the c o bond fig 4 e which represented the stronger interaction between the hydrolysates of patc and the c o of ps in addition to o h o a weak hydrogen bond of c h o could be formed between the coagulants and ps as shown in fig 4 d the electron cloud density of the c atoms in aliphatic c h increased after coagulation which was caused by the contact between the oh of the coagulant and the c h group of ps through hydrogen bonding in summary the interaction mechanism between the hydrolysates of the coagulants and the ps particles could be concluded as follows polar interaction such as hydrogen bonding was the main interaction mechanism between the hydrolysates of the coagulants and the ps particles the hydrolysates of the coagulants could not only form a strong hydrogen bond of o h o with the c o group of ps but also generate a weak hydrogen bonding interaction of c h o with the aliphatic c h of ps 3 3 interaction between ha ps and patc based on the results in section 3 2 it was found that in comparison to pac and ptc patc had a superior performance for the removal of ha and ps particles accordingly patc was used to remove ha ps particles in this section and the interaction between ha ps and patc was explored the results of the removal efficiency of ps ha and ha ps using patc are displayed in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 a b the combination of ha and ps weakened their removal efficiency as illustrated in section 3 1 ha ps particle had stronger spatial stability and charge repulsion compared with pure ha and ps and thus it was difficult to aggregate after the addition of patc fig 5 c d and fig s5 this result was similar to previous studies in which the removal efficiency of the complexes formed by the interaction of mps and other contaminants e g ha and antibiotics was poor fazeli sangani et al 2019 lu et al 2021 wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 ftir and xps spectra were used to further analyze the coagulation mechanism of patc in removing ha ps particles from the perspective of the interaction between ha and ps ftir spectra in fig 5 e exhibited that after patc coagulation the intensity of the peaks representing the c o and co groups of ha ps were stronger than those of ps flocs similarly compared with flocs of ha and ps after patc coagulation the displacement of the c o and oh peaks was larger and the peak area of the π π satellite was smaller for the ha ps flocs fig 5 f g these phenomena could be explained by the fact that in the patc ha ps system an interaction existed not only between ha and ps but also between patc and ha ps as illustrated in sections 3 1 and 3 2 the c o and aliphatic ch of ps could interact with the oh and cooh groups of ha by forming hydrogen bonds however c o aliphatic ch oh and cooh were the main active sites of ps and ha to bind with patc hydrolysates respectively liu et al 2022b song et al 2019 therefore the combination of ha and ps occupied their binding sites to patc hydrolysates thereby resulting in the poor removal efficiency of both ha and ps in the ha ps composite system in general the combined action of the enhanced steric stabilization increasing electrostatic repulsion and the reduced amounts of the binding sites resulted in the poor removal efficiency of ha and ps in the ha ps composite system based on the above findings the possible interaction pathways among ha ps and the hydrolysates of patc are presented in fig 6 3 4 ps removal in real surface water the coagulation performance of patc was investigated to treat actual lake water and actual lake water ps composite pollution also pac and ptc were taken as the comparison as shown in fig 7 a b patc could effectively remove the turbidity and nom in the actual lake water when the patc dosage reached 1 10 3 mol al3 l the residual turbidity decreased from 13 73 ntu to 0 76 ntu and the removal efficiency of uv254 and doc was 52 46 and 38 04 respectively although the further increase in the dosage resulted in a continuous increase in doc removal the uv and turbidity removal remained stable and decreased based on the results in fig 7 a b the optimal dosage of 1 10 3 mol al3 l for patc was used in the following work and the dosages of pac and ptc were decided according to the metal mass concentration of patc in this section the actual surface water was pre spiked with ps solution to obtain the lake water ps composite system with a ps concentration of 10 mg l the suva values of the lake water ps were smaller than ha ps which indicated that the actual lake water contained more hydrophilic organic matter fig 7 c in principle the stronger the hydrophilicity of the test water the more difficult it is to treat kellerman et al 2018 in the lake water ps composite system the removal efficiency of ps using patc was only 6 09 which was 16 87 lower than that in the ha ps composite system fig 5 a and fig 7 d the reduction of the removal efficiency of ps in the lake water ps composite system could be interpreted by the enhanced competition of various nom for the binding sites of ps during the ha ps composite system ha was the sole substance to occupy the binding sites of ps however there were multiple organics such as ha like substances fulvic acid fa like matters and tryptophan protein like ones that existed in the lake water ps composite system compared with single ha the nom with different molecular weights hydrophilicity and functional groups could adsorb on the ps surface more easily and occupy more active sites of the ps which hindered the interaction between ps and the patc hydrolysates similarly the study by gong et al found that the addition of ps cooh to the actual surface water resulted in a decrease in its removal efficiency due to the presence of noms in the surface water gong et al 2022 and the study by petdayesh et al claimed that the wastewater from the primary sedimentation effluent was a complex system containing multiple compounds such as mps noms inorganic particles and other impurities the interactions between these compounds including electrostatic screening and electrostatic stabilization effects led to a decrease in the removal of mps peydayesh et al 2021 it was noteworthy that patc performed better than pac and ptc for ps removal fig 7 c d this was because compared with the hydrolysates of pac and ptc the hydrolysates of patc were multiple including al hydrolysate species ti hydrolysate species and al ti copolymers which have more active sites and larger specific surface area to contact various contaminants with a broader molecular weight range liu et al 2022b the ph of the actual lake water was 8 25 0 40 while the coagulant would release h in the hydrolysis process guo et al 2022 therefore the effluent ph after pac and patc coagulation decreased to 6 97 0 66 and 6 81 0 08 fig s6 which still met the surface water environmental quality standard while the effluent ph by adding ptc was 3 56 0 42 which was not conducive to the subsequent water treatment processes in practice overall these results indicate that patc is expected to be a promising coagulant in removing nom and ps from water 4 conclusions in this study the coagulation performance of pac ptc and patc to remove ps was evaluated and the interaction mechanism between ps ha and coagulant hydrolysates was explored using xdlvo theory ftir and xps analysis the coagulation experiments showed that compared with pac and ptc patc was more effective in weakening the electrostatic repulsive forces between ps particles and promoting their destabilization and heteroaggregation over a wider ph range the results of xdlvo theory revealed that polar interactions vab such as hydrogen bonding dominated the removal of ps by patc the hydrolysates of patc could interact with the c o and aliphatic c h groups of ps by hydrogen bonding and then remove ps through the incorporation of compression double layer charge neutralization adsorption and sweeping effects the interaction between ha and ps was mainly the π π conjugation and hydrogen bonding between the cooh oh and c o groups of ha and the c o or aliphatic c h groups of ps therefore the active sites of ha e g cooh and oh and ps e g c o and aliphatic c h to bind with the coagulant hydrolysates were reduced after the combination of ha and ps accordingly the removal efficiency of both ps and ha decreased in ha ps composite system various organic matters in the actual lake water could adsorb on the ps surface more easily than the sole ha which led to the poor removal efficiency of ps in the lake water ps composite system remarkably even in the actual lake water treatment patc performed better than pac and ptc to remove ps particles which preliminarily demonstrated the application potential of patc in practice further studies

15051,microplastics mps particles bring potential threats to the aqueous environment and the coexistence of natural organic matter nom enhances their toxicity coagulation is an efficient method for particle removal and exploring the binding sites and modes of the coagulant hydrolysates with mps in the presence of nom is essential to understand the coagulation mechanism in this study a novel polymerized polyaluminum titanium chloride composite coagulant patc was prepared and used to remove polystyrene ps it was found that patc could compress or even destroy the surface layer of the negatively charged ps in comparison to pac and ptc patc was more efficient in decreasing the energy barrier of the ps particles and increasing their aggregation rate over a wider ph range the results of the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo calculation revealed that the interaction between the hydrolysates of patc and ps was mainly polar interaction vab such as hydrogen bonding the peak intensity and peak shift in fourier transformed infrared ftir and x ray photoelectron spectra xps were analyzed to further explore the interaction between the hydrolysates of patc and ps it was found that hydrogen bonding existed between the oh group of patc and the aliphatic c h and c o groups of ps and the main interaction between ha and ps was the π π conjugation and hydrogen bonding between the cooh oh and c o groups of ha and the c o and aliphatic c h groups of ps therefore in the ha ps system the active sites of ha e g cooh and oh and ps e g c o and aliphatic c h binding with the coagulants were occupied which accordingly led to the dramatic decline in the removal efficiency of both ha and ps in actual lake water treatment although the removal efficiency of ps was significantly poor patc performed better for ps removal than pac and ptc besides the effluent ph was maintained at 6 81 0 08 which met the requirements of the subsequent water treatment process this study provides systematic knowledge for understanding the interaction between ps nom and coagulant hydrolysates and further confirms the application potential of patc for mps removal graphical

andrady 2011 hydrolysis li et al 2018 and thermal degradation huangfu et al 2019 water pollution caused by mps has attracted widespread concern due to their large surface area high surface activity and easy bioavailability peydayesh et al 2021 natural organic matter nom widely existing in surface water can combine with toxic compounds to adversely affect the environment liu et al 2021 peydayesh et al 2021 the toxicity and ecological activity of the complexes formed by mps and nom are stronger and more variable than the single pollutants liu et al 2021 rainieri et al 2018 humic acid ha as a typical nom has large amounts of functional groups and binding sites song et al 2019 which is easy to combine with pesticides and mps liu et al 2019 the interaction between ha and mps will change the physicochemical properties of ha and mps including hydrophobicity electronegativity particle size and functional groups cai et al 2018 therefore the ha mps complexes are more difficult to be removed than the single ha or mps lu et al 2021 considering the high toxicity and risk of the ha mps complexes the development of control strategies and technologies to remove ha mps complexes has become a research priority coagulation is a widely used water treatment technology due to its low cost and high efficiency which has been studied extensively in removing mps ho et al 2022 ramirez arenas et al 2022 xu et al 2021 traditional coagulants such as aluminum al and iron fe salts have some shortages i low efficiency in removing mps ii health risks or economic burdens caused by residual al and coagulation sludge iii unacceptable color and odor of effluent after fe coagulation du et al 2021 gan et al 2021a ma et al 2019a ma et al 2019b zhang et al 2020 in recent years titanium ti based coagulants have shown better performance in removing micropollutants and nom compared with al fe coagulants gan et al 2021c however single ti based coagulant has some drawbacks in use such as poor stability sensitivity to water quality and extremely low effluent ph gan et al 2021a although prehydrolysis can overcome these defects of the single ti based salts the polymerized ti coagulants are still prone to further hydrolysis during storage guo et al 2022 liu et al 2022b composite metal coagulants can cover the shortages of single metal salts guo et al 2022 in our previous work we prepared a highly polymerized aluminum titanium chloride composite coagulant patc by pre hydrolysis and confirmed its high efficiency in ha kaolin simulated water treatment liu et al 2022a it was found that the hydrolysates of patc showed a flower like structure which had higher surface charge density and more binding sites than those of polyaluminum chloride pac and polytitanium chloride ptc liu et al 2022b accordingly patc is expected to be efficient in removing mps and ha mps complexes nevertheless to the best of our knowledge few studies on the remediation of mps contaminated water using patc the overall performance and underlying mechanisms of patc to treat mps contaminated water remain unclear in addition the complexity of the actual water body mainly the coexisting nom can affect the aggregation behavior of mps della torre et al 2014 xu et al 2021 however the efficiency and mechanism of patc for mps removal with the coexistence of organic matter have not been systematically investigated to address the above issues the overall objective of this paper was to evaluate the coagulation performance and mechanism of patc in removing mps from the natural water pac and ptc were taken as the comparison polystyrene ps is one of the most widely used plastics worldwide due to its versatility and nonbiodegradability della torre et al 2014 mark a browne et al 2008 which was used to represent mps in this study the specific objectives of this work were to i study the performance of pac ptc and patc in removing ps ii investigate the interaction mechanism between the coexisting nom and ps particles iii explore the coagulation mechanism of patc for ps removal from the perspective of the interaction between ps nom and the hydrolysates of coagulants based on the theoretical calculations and chemical characterization this work will provide new insight into the interaction between the hydrolysates of coagulants mps and nom 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and test

water was collected in july at shandong university in qingdao shandong province china the latitude and longitude of the sampling site were 120 68 and 36 37 respectively before each set of experiments

5 detailed preparation methods for pac and ptc are described in supplementary information si 2 3 coagulation experiments the coagulation tests were conducted with a 250 ml glass beaker on a standard jar test apparatus zr4 6 zhongrun water industry technology development co ltd china hcl 1 m and naoh 1 m solutions were used to adjust the ph of the water sample before the experiments batch experiments were carried out in four stages i firstly the test water was stirred rapidly at 200 rpm for 30 s ii next the coagulants were added into the jars and stirred at 200 rpm for 40 s iii and then the stirring speed was adjusted to 50 rpm and kept for 20 min iv finally the mixture was settled without stirring for30 min for the single ps system ps concentration was measured by a total organic carbon analyzer toc vcph shimadzu japan and a turbidimeter 2100 q hach us respectively toc values were used as the main indicator to quantify ps concentration in this study peydayesh et al 2021 skaf et al 2020 the supernatant after coagulation was collected and used directly without filtration for toc turbidity and zeta potential zetasizer nano malvern instruments uk assays gong et al 2022 hong et al 2021 test methods for organic matter concentration and turbidity of ha actual lake water can be found in section s2 for ha actual lake water ps composite system separate quantification of ha and ps using a customized approach the supernatant after filtration through a 0 45 μm aqueous polyethersulfone membrane was used to determine uv254 and dissolved organic carbon doc which represented the residual organic matters after coagulation moreover specific uv absorbance suva was used to further characterize the hydrophilicity of the contaminates before and after coagulation the specific calculation is shown in section s2 the ps was quantified using the following procedures i accurate 40 ml supernatant was taken 2 cm below the water surface and the target supernatant was acidified with hcl 1 m for 2 h to remove flocs from the ps surface lu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 ii the target solution was filtered using a 0 45 μm glass fiber membrane iii ps trapped on the membrane was rinsed with di water iv and then the membrane was sonicated for 2 min to ensure that ps was completely rinsed off v finally the toc concentration of the solution was measured the results of the recovery rate and applicability of the method are shown in fig s1 2 4 characterization of ps and flocs the average hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential of ps under different ph conditions were measured by dynamic light scattering dls with a zetasizer nano zs instrument zhang et al 2012 the polydispersity index pdi value is calculated as follows gong et al 2022 1 pdi σ 2 z d 2 where σ and zd represent the standard deviation and average hydrodynamic diameter respectively a contact angle system spca x1 harke was employed for contact angle measurement the morphology of ps before coagulation was observed using scanning electron microscopy sem tescan mira4 the coagulated flocs were collected and vacuum dried in a freeze dryer for sem and transmission electron microscope tem fei tecnai g2 f20 analysis the surface functional groups of ps ha and ha ps before and after coagulation were characterized by fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy ftir thermo scientific nicolet in10 and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo scientific k alpha the details about the ftir and xps characterization methods are shown in the si 2 5 data analysis and theoretical calculation the t test and correlation analysis were performed separately in origin 2022 the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory states that the total interaction energy vtotal includes van der waals attraction energy vvdw electrical repulsion energy vedl and lewis acid base interaction energy vab zhang et al 2022 the vtotal potential energy curves can be used to predict the aggregation behavior of particles which can explain the ps coagulation mechanism dong et al 2021 gong et al 2022 detailed information about the calculations is provided in section s5 aggregation tests were determined using time resolved dls mastersizer 3000 malvern uk the hydrodynamic diameter dh was monitored immediately after adding the coagulant a complete autocorrelation function was recorded every 30 s and lasted for 5 min the aggregation rate was the slope of dh versus time ddh dt which was obtained by the linear least squares regression analysis over the time range of aggregation initiation t0 to the time when dh over 1 50 dh 0 bouchard et al 2012 gong et al 2022 the specific calculations are exhibited in the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 interactions between ha and ps ps mps are regular spheres with relatively uniform particle size distribution and an average hydrodynamic diameter of 5 0 0 2 μm fig 1 a d the adsorption of ha on the surface of ps led to a rough surface and a wide particle size distribution fig 1 chen et al 2018 the pdi value of ps suspension was 0 021 less than 0 200 which indicated that ps mps were stably dispersed in water without obvious aggregation gong et al 2022 izquierdo et al 2005 however the addition of ha led to a significant increase in the pdi value 0 634 which indicated that ha ps particles had poor dispersion in comparison to the ps particles the particles with poor dispersion and wide particle size distribution were difficult to remove besides the stability of ps was greatly influenced by the presence of ha chen et al 2018 the stability of the colloids can be elucidated by the xdlvo theory wang et al 2020 the primary energy barrier φmax of the ha ps particle was significantly higher than that of pure ha and ps fig 2 a c which implied that the ha ps particles were more stable and required more kinetic energy to overcome the interparticle repulsion to aggregate cai et al 2018 moreover the addition of ha increased the electronegativity of the particle surface fig 2 d which enhanced the stability of the particles and resulted in an increase in inter particle repulsion mao et al 2020 as shown in fig 1 g i the water contact angle wca of ps exceeded 90 which indicated its relatively hydrophobic adsorption surface the ha ps showed a lower wca than ps indicating that the interaction between ha and ps enhanced the surface hydrophilicity of ps based on the above findings the removal efficiency of the ps particles would be decreased in the ha ps composite system the change of the chemical bonds caused by the interaction between ha and ps was confirmed by ftir fig 2 g basically no significant change was observed in the ftir spectra after the combination of ha and ps which demonstrated that noncovalent interplay dominated the interaction between ha and ps rather than the formation of covalent bonds xiong et al 2020 xps was used to further analyze the interaction mechanism between ha and ps it was found that the c o 531 7 ev and oh 532 6 ev groups in ha ps moved toward the high binding energy be li et al 2021 which was due to the cooh oh and c o groups of ha could interact with ps as the electron donating groups chen et al 2018 after interaction with ha the hydrogen bond between ha and ps led to the appearance of the oh o co subpeak at 532 8 ev fig 2 e xiong et al 2020 as shown in fig 2 f four characteristic peaks at 284 4 285 1 286 3 and 289 1 ev were observed in the c1s spectra which represented aromatic ch aliphatic ch c o and π π interaction respectively lin et al 2020 xiong et al 2020 the be of c o and aliphatic ch of ps shifted to the low direction fig 2 e f which was an indicator that electron transfer occurred between ha and ps xiong et al 2020 this result suggested that the c o and aliphatic ch groups of ps might be the active sites to interact with ha remarkably the peak of the π π bond moved from 289 1 ev to 288 7 ev which further confirmed that the π π conjugation existed between ps and ha xiong et al 2020 moreover the suva value of ha ps was smaller than that of ha table s2 which indicated that the relative content of the unsaturated bonds and aromatic compounds of ha was reduced after interacting with ps kellerman et al 2018 accordingly it was inferred that the unsaturated bonds or polycyclic aromatic compounds of ha preferred to bind with ps particles based on the above results an interaction pathway between ha and ps was proposed fig 2 h specifically the benzene ring of ps first contacted the aromatic structure of ha via π π conjugation and then the c o and aliphatic ch of ps interacted with the cooh oh and c o groups of ha by hydrogen bonding to form a highly conjugated copolymer 3 2 interaction between ps and coagulants 3 2 1 effect of ph ph can affect coagulation efficiency and mechanism by influencing the stability of ps and the transformation of coagulant hydrolysates gong et al 2022 the settling performance of ps at different ph conditions was investigated fig s2 which showed that the settling rate of ps could be ignored 0 36 7 66 in the ph range of 2 to 10 as shown in fig 3 a b with the increase of ph ptc showed a decreasing efficiency in removing ps when pac or patc was added the removal efficiency of ps exhibited a trend of first increasing and then decreasing as the ph increased and ph 6 and ph 7 were the inflection points respectively after coagulation treatment the φmax of ps was significantly reduced which demonstrated that the addition of coagulants led to the destabilization and aggregation of ps fig 3 c e lower secondary minimum φsec depth indicated that the particles tended to aggregate and settle more easily zhang et al 2022 the φsec of ps was positively correlated with ph after the addition of the coagulants so the aggregation rate of ps should theoretically decrease with the increase of ph however the experimental results showed that the aggregation rate of ps first increased and then decreased as the ph increased fig 3 c h this discrepancy suggested that other important mechanisms were involved in ps removal except for van der waals attraction energy electrical repulsion energy and lewis acid base interaction energy previous studies showed that the introduced mn m refers to al or ti could be adsorbed on the ps surface which made the surface of ps exhibit electrostatic heterogeneity cai et al 2018 gong et al 2022 however in the xdlvo theory only the average value of the particle surface charges was used neglecting the heterogeneity of the interacting surfaces valmacco et al 2016 therefore xdlvo theory cannot accurately predict the complex interaction forces between the multiple coagulant hydrolysates and ps under different ph conditions the interaction mechanism between the coagulants and ps under different ph conditions was mainly related to the coagulant hydrolysates zhang et al 2022 the hydrolysis polymerization of ptc was too fast therefore its charge neutralization ability was strong under acidic conditions gan et al 2021b but under neutral alkaline conditions the charge of its hydrolysates turned negative fig s3 the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged hydrolysates of ptc and ps particles was enhanced fig 3 b which correspondingly decreased the aggregation rate of ps particles and ultimately reduced their removal efficiency with the increase of ph pac could first hydrolyze to produce positively charged polynuclear hydroxyl complexes and then form amorphous hydroxides with poor charge neutralization ability zhao et al 2011 as shown in fig 3 b when the ph increased from 2 to 6 and further to 10 the zeta potential of flocs formed by pac increased from 0 32 mv to 0 759 mv and then decreased to 3 97 mv remarkably the aggregation rate and removal efficiency of ps by adding pac showed the same tendency as the zeta potentials of flocs the phenomenon indicated that the change of the surface charge caused by mn dominated the particles aggregation behavior cai et al 2018 patc was mainly presented as monomeric positive hydrolysates under acidic conditions such as al oh 2o tio and al oh 2tio3 liu et al 2022b with the increase of ph highly polymerized positive hydrolysates of patc e g al oh 3 am tio oh 2 am al13 and al2 oh 2o2ti oh 2 2 became dominant liu et al 2022b these polymers could neutralize the negatively charged ps which led to the destabilization of ps thus as the ph increased from 2 to 7 the zeta potential of the flocs after patc coagulation changed from 0 27 mv to 4 02 mv after 5 min the hydrodynamic diameter increased dramatically from 4 μm to 728 μm fig 3 which further improved the aggregation rate from 0 06 μm s ph 2 to 2 48 μm s ph 7 and removal efficiency of ps table s3 when ph reached 10 amorphous hydroxides of patc dominated the coagulation process the zeta potential of flocs decreased to 2 82 mv and the corresponding hydrodynamic diameter was reduced to 630 μm thereby resulting in a decrease in aggregation rate 1 76 μm s and ps removal 11 65 fig 3 3 2 2 effect of coagulant considering that the ph of the actual surface water was weakly alkaline so the coagulation mechanism of different coagulants to remove ps was analyzed at ph 8 as shown in fig 4 b the φmax of ps decreased to 2 75 4 65 and 1 11 kt after the coagulation with pac ptc and patc respectively thus compared with pac and ptc patc was more effective in weakening the electrostatic repulsive forces among the ps particles and promoting their heteroaggregation oriekhova and stoll 2018 for pac and patc the absolute value of the floc zeta potential had a strong correlation with the ps removal pearson s r 0 88 and 0 83 which indicated that the ps removal might be dominated by the charge neutralization rajala et al 2020 in the case of ptc the above correlation was poor pearson s r 0 20 which indicated that the removal mechanism of ps by ptc might be sweep flocculation or a combination of sweep flocculation and charge neutralization rather than the single charge neutralization rajala et al 2020 entrapment of coagulant hydrolysates around multiple spheres based on electrostatic adsorption and sweeping was visible in sem fig 4 i k and tem images fig s4 the interaction energy between ps and the coagulants was analyzed by xdlvo theory vvdw vedl and hydrodynamic forces are considered the main factors for collision between particles and coagulants guo et al 2020 since the suspension was stationary during settling hydrodynamic forces were neglected and vvdw vedl and vab were assumed to be the dominant forces zhang et al 2022 the data in table s1 showed that after coagulation the value of vab was positive while that of vedl and vvdw were negative no matter which type of coagulant was used it demonstrated that vab interaction was repulsive while vedl and vvdw interactions were attractive in coagulation tian et al 2017 when the hydrolysates of the coagulants approached ps particles they not only experienced attractive energy but also needed to overcome repulsive interaction energy besides the results in table s1 showed that the values of vab were significantly higher than those of vedl and vvdw which implied that the influence of vab on the total interaction energy composition was more significant than that of vedl and vvdw furthermore this result indicated that polar interaction played a more important role in ps removal than van der waals attraction energy and electrical repulsion energy at short distances it was due to that polar interaction determined the energy barrier strength of ps and thus affected the ps removal the chemical interaction between the coagulants and ps was further analyzed by ftir and xps analysis the ftir spectra of the coagulated flocs in fig 4 c show that the peak of the hydrogen bond at 3370 cm 1 became stronger than the virgin ps which implied that the hydrogen bonding force was involved in the interaction between the coagulants and ps he et al 2022 liu et al 2022c xps spectra in fig 4 e exhibited that the subpeak of oh o co at 532 8 ev was a sign of hydrogen bonding xiong et al 2020 and the appearance of this peak indicated the presence of hydrogen bonding in the coagulation process after patc coagulation the peak intensity of the hydrogen bond was the strongest among the three coagulation systems which demonstrated that the hydrogen bonding force in patc coagulation was stronger than that in pac and ptc coagulation xps spectra in fig 4 e showed that after coagulation the c o bond of ps moved to the direction of low be which indicated that the electron cloud density of o atoms increased guo et al 2022 the above phenomenon was caused by the formation of the hydrogen bond between the oh of the coagulants and the c o groups of ps moreover compared with pac and ptc patc coagulation caused a more obvious displacement of the peak of the c o bond fig 4 e which represented the stronger interaction between the hydrolysates of patc and the c o of ps in addition to o h o a weak hydrogen bond of c h o could be formed between the coagulants and ps as shown in fig 4 d the electron cloud density of the c atoms in aliphatic c h increased after coagulation which was caused by the contact between the oh of the coagulant and the c h group of ps through hydrogen bonding in summary the interaction mechanism between the hydrolysates of the coagulants and the ps particles could be concluded as follows polar interaction such as hydrogen bonding was the main interaction mechanism between the hydrolysates of the coagulants and the ps particles the hydrolysates of the coagulants could not only form a strong hydrogen bond of o h o with the c o group of ps but also generate a weak hydrogen bonding interaction of c h o with the aliphatic c h of ps 3 3 interaction between ha ps and patc based on the results in section 3 2 it was found that in comparison to pac and ptc patc had a superior performance for the removal of ha and ps particles accordingly patc was used to remove ha ps particles in this section and the interaction between ha ps and patc was explored the results of the removal efficiency of ps ha and ha ps using patc are displayed in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 a b the combination of ha and ps weakened their removal efficiency as illustrated in section 3 1 ha ps particle had stronger spatial stability and charge repulsion compared with pure ha and ps and thus it was difficult to aggregate after the addition of patc fig 5 c d and fig s5 this result was similar to previous studies in which the removal efficiency of the complexes formed by the interaction of mps and other contaminants e g ha and antibiotics was poor fazeli sangani et al 2019 lu et al 2021 wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 ftir and xps spectra were used to further analyze the coagulation mechanism of patc in removing ha ps particles from the perspective of the interaction between ha and ps ftir spectra in fig 5 e exhibited that after patc coagulation the intensity of the peaks representing the c o and co groups of ha ps were stronger than those of ps flocs similarly compared with flocs of ha and ps after patc coagulation the displacement of the c o and oh peaks was larger and the peak area of the π π satellite was smaller for the ha ps flocs fig 5 f g these phenomena could be explained by the fact that in the patc ha ps system an interaction existed not only between ha and ps but also between patc and ha ps as illustrated in sections 3 1 and 3 2 the c o and aliphatic ch of ps could interact with the oh and cooh groups of ha by forming hydrogen bonds however c o aliphatic ch oh and cooh were the main active sites of ps and ha to bind with patc hydrolysates respectively liu et al 2022b song et al 2019 therefore the combination of ha and ps occupied their binding sites to patc hydrolysates thereby resulting in the poor removal efficiency of both ha and ps in the ha ps composite system in general the combined action of the enhanced steric stabilization increasing electrostatic repulsion and the reduced amounts of the binding sites resulted in the poor removal efficiency of ha and ps in the ha ps composite system based on the above findings the possible interaction pathways among ha ps and the hydrolysates of patc are presented in fig 6 3 4 ps removal in real surface water the coagulation performance of patc was investigated to treat actual lake water and actual lake water ps composite pollution also pac and ptc were taken as the comparison as shown in fig 7 a b patc could effectively remove the turbidity and nom in the actual lake water when the patc dosage reached 1 10 3 mol al3 l the residual turbidity decreased from 13 73 ntu to 0 76 ntu and the removal efficiency of uv254 and doc was 52 46 and 38 04 respectively although the further increase in the dosage resulted in a continuous increase in doc removal the uv and turbidity removal remained stable and decreased based on the results in fig 7 a b the optimal dosage of 1 10 3 mol al3 l for patc was used in the following work and the dosages of pac and ptc were decided according to the metal mass concentration of patc in this section the actual surface water was pre spiked with ps solution to obtain the lake water ps composite system with a ps concentration of 10 mg l the suva values of the lake water ps were smaller than ha ps which indicated that the actual lake water contained more hydrophilic organic matter fig 7 c in principle the stronger the hydrophilicity of the test water the more difficult it is to treat kellerman et al 2018 in the lake water ps composite system the removal efficiency of ps using patc was only 6 09 which was 16 87 lower than that in the ha ps composite system fig 5 a and fig 7 d the reduction of the removal efficiency of ps in the lake water ps composite system could be interpreted by the enhanced competition of various nom for the binding sites of ps during the ha ps composite system ha was the sole substance to occupy the binding sites of ps however there were multiple organics such as ha like substances fulvic acid fa like matters and tryptophan protein like ones that existed in the lake water ps composite system compared with single ha the nom with different molecular weights hydrophilicity and functional groups could adsorb on the ps surface more easily and occupy more active sites of the ps which hindered the interaction between ps and the patc hydrolysates similarly the study by gong et al found that the addition of ps cooh to the actual surface water resulted in a decrease in its removal efficiency due to the presence of noms in the surface water gong et al 2022 and the study by petdayesh et al claimed that the wastewater from the primary sedimentation effluent was a complex system containing multiple compounds such as mps noms inorganic particles and other impurities the interactions between these compounds including electrostatic screening and electrostatic stabilization effects led to a decrease in the removal of mps peydayesh et al 2021 it was noteworthy that patc performed better than pac and ptc for ps removal fig 7 c d this was because compared with the hydrolysates of pac and ptc the hydrolysates of patc were multiple including al hydrolysate species ti hydrolysate species and al ti copolymers which have more active sites and larger specific surface area to contact various contaminants with a broader molecular weight range liu et al 2022b the ph of the actual lake water was 8 25 0 40 while the coagulant would release h in the hydrolysis process guo et al 2022 therefore the effluent ph after pac and patc coagulation decreased to 6 97 0 66 and 6 81 0 08 fig s6 which still met the surface water environmental quality standard while the effluent ph by adding ptc was 3 56 0 42 which was not conducive to the subsequent water treatment processes in practice overall these results indicate that patc is expected to be a promising coagulant in removing nom and ps from water 4 conclusions in this study the coagulation performance of pac ptc and patc to remove ps was evaluated and the interaction mechanism between ps ha and coagulant hydrolysates was explored using xdlvo theory ftir and xps analysis the coagulation experiments showed that compared with pac and ptc patc was more effective in weakening the electrostatic repulsive forces between ps particles and promoting their destabilization and heteroaggregation over a wider ph range the results of xdlvo theory revealed that polar interactions vab such as hydrogen bonding dominated the removal of ps by patc the hydrolysates of patc could interact with the c o and aliphatic c h groups of ps by hydrogen bonding and then remove ps through the incorporation of compression double layer charge neutralization adsorption and sweeping effects the interaction between ha and ps was mainly the π π conjugation and hydrogen bonding between the cooh oh and c o groups of ha and the c o or aliphatic c h groups of ps therefore the active sites of ha e g cooh and oh and ps e g c o and aliphatic c h to bind with the coagulant hydrolysates were reduced after the combination of ha and ps accordingly the removal efficiency of both ps and ha decreased in ha ps composite system various organic matters in the actual lake water could adsorb on the ps surface more easily than the sole ha which led to the poor removal efficiency of ps in the lake water ps composite system remarkably even in the actual lake water treatment patc performed better than pac and ptc to remove ps particles which preliminarily demonstrated the application potential of patc in practice further studies

15052,per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas are recognized as persistent pollutants that have been found in drinking water sources on a global scale semi permeable membrane treatment processes such as reverse osmosis and nanofiltration nf have been shown effective at removing pfas however disposal of pfas laden concentrate is problematic without treatment of the concentrate pfas is released into the environment the present work examined a novel pfas removal scheme for drinking water using nf filtration with treatment of the resulting nf concentrate via foam fractionation ff with and without co surfactants the nf pilot removed 98 of pfas from afff contaminated groundwater producing permeate with 1 4 ng l 1 total pfas using ff resulted in pfas removal efficiency of 90 from the nf concentrate and with improved removal of 94 with addition of cationic co surfactant the resulting foamate composed approximately 2 of the nf feedwater volume and contained greater than 3000 ng l 1 pfas or 41 times greater than the nf feedwater addition of the cationic co surfactant to the ff process resulted in increased removal efficiency of the shorter chain pfas specifically 37 for pfpea 9 for pfhxa and 34 for pfbs thus attaining 59 99 and 96 removal efficiency respectively pfoa pfpes pfhxs pfos each attained 99 ff removal with or without co surfactant addition graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pfas foam fractionation nanofiltration drinking water concentrate treatment techniques data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas have been found in drinking water sources throughout the world ericson et al 2009 post et al 2012 appleman et al 2014 rahman et al 2014 gyllenhammar et al 2015 and due to health based effects lower acceptable limits for pfas in drinking water have been implemented or proposed in europe and the u s usepa 2016a usepa 2016b eu 2020 federal register 2022 for example in sweden slv 2022 the proposed action limit is 4 ng l 1 for the sum of four pfas pfas4 namely pfna pfoa pfhxs and pfos and a limit of 100 ng l 1 for the sum of twenty one pfas pfas21 table s1 lists these twenty one even more challenging is denmark s regulation of 2 ng l 1 for pfas4 dmoe 2021 fortunately reverse osmosis ro and nanofiltration nf have been shown effective at reducing pfas concentrations by 90 99 appleman et al 2013 wang et al 2018 franke et al 2019 soriano et al 2020 2021 lee et al 2022 thereby providing a method to lower pfas concentrations to the required limits unfortunately for pfas contaminated feedwater ro and nf produce a pfas laden concentrate with typical concentrate volumes being 10 20 of the feedwater with 5 10 times greater pfas concentration which must be treated before discharge or managed so as not to contaminate the environment tow et al 2021 franke et al 2021 usepa 2022 hvmfs 2019 the present work examines using nf treatment to meet lower pfas limits in drinking water while utilizing foam fractionation ff for removal of pfas from nf concentrate thereby allowing safe concentrate discharge into the environment no reports of ff treatment for pfas removal from nf concentrate have been published to the authors knowledge however ff has been shown to be effective at removing pfas from landfill leachate wastewater and contaminated groundwater meng et al 2018 dai et al 2019 robey et al 2020 mccleaf et al 2021 smith et al 2022 whereas nf can reliably remove pfas from even relatively dilute pfas contaminated source waters to low levels in the permeate ff is not typically efficient unless applied on waters with higher concentrations of pfas and thus may be more effectively used for treatment of nf concentrate than source water another advantage of using ff on the nf concentrate as opposed to directly on the source water is that smaller volumes would need to be treated thereby reducing the size and complexity of the ff process installation one of the present work s key research questions is to determine if the pfas level in nf concentrate is high enough to make ff a good removal process for treating nf concentrate ff utilizes the surface active molecules found in the liquid which attach to the gas liquid interface of the bubbles and form a foam on the liquid surface burghoff 2012a burghoff 2012b the process can be run in batch or continuous mode and foam once removed from the retentate and collapsed is referred to as foamate while the treated liquid as retentate process parameters such as ph gas flow rate temperature bubble size and additives have been investigated merz et al 2011 chai et al 1998 fanaie et al 2020 ff has the added benefit that due to the resulting low volume highly concentrated pfas foamate destructive techniques can be more efficiently applied such as advanced chemical oxidation plasma based treatment chemical reduction electrochemical oxidation supercritical water oxidation sonochemical methods or incineration lu et al 2020 tow et al 2021 banks et al 2020 li et al 2019 mahinroosta et al 2020 laboratory and bench scale application of ff for pfas removal has been reported with average removal efficiencies ranging from of 20 to 100 for spiked lab scale studies and for contaminated landfill leachate and groundwater robey et al 2020 mccleaf et al 2021 smith et al 2022 buckley et al 2021 burns et al 2021 2022 a common finding is removal efficiency of over 90 for individual long chain pfas but with lower removal efficiency for short chain pfas in lab studies the addition of co surfactants has been shown enhance pfas removal from wastewater landfill leachate and contaminated groundwater meng et al 2018 taseidifar 2020 buckley et al 2022 yueh feng et al 2021 reported enhanced pfoa removal efficiency from wastewater using cationic surfactants and postulated that cationic surfactants with a linear alkyl chain with the same number of carbons in the chain are the best flotation aids for pfoa the addition of a co surfactant has been reported to decrease the critical micelle concentration cmc and create a more active surface especially for surfactants with the same carbon chain length tian et al 2017 regev et al 1996 vo et al 2023 found in lab scale that cationic and zwitterionic co surfactants improved removal of short chain pfas from landfill leachate due to charge interaction with oppositely charged pfas functional groups the present study is unique in that removal of pfas from contaminated municipal groundwater was investigated for the novel combination of nf for drinking water treatment coupled with ff for treatment of the resulting nf concentrate the removal efficiency of a nf pilot using full scale membranes was monitored for almost 6 months using feedwater from pfas contaminated wellfields the concentrate collected from this nf pilot was used to investigate the efficiency of ff for treating nf concentrate in two trials trial 1 consisted of batch lab scale testing of ff with and without the addition of a co surfactant aid four co surfactants cationic two anionic non ionic were tested with three different dosages trial 2 consisted of determining pfas removal efficiency of continuous pilot scale ff with and without addition of the co surfactant determined as most effective in trial 1 three different surfactant dosages were tested each in triplicate the efficiency and selectivity of ff for removal of the eight pfas compounds found in the concentrate were determined along with improved efficiency afforded by the co surfactant the work addressed the specific conditions encountered for designing a future full scale nf facility at uppsala water and waste ltd s bäcklösa drinking water treatment plant to meet the drinking water goal of pfas4 4 ng l 1 slv 2022 while preventing the discharge of pfas laden concentrate to the lake malaren sweden s largest source of raw drinking water 2 materials and methods the treatment setup investigated in the work shown is shown in fig s1 with water quality sampling points eight pfas of the thirty four pfas analyzed table s1 were found above limit of detection lod concentrations in the raw water fed to the nf pilot specifically pfpea pfhxa pfhpa pfoa pfbs pfpes pfhxs and pfos 2 1 nanofiltration nf pilot raw water from the municipal wellfield was diverted to the nf membrane pilot after the aeration stage at the bäcklösa drinking water treatment plant in uppsala sweden the nf pilot as shown in fig s1 consisted of a constant pumped flow of approximately 10 m3 h 1 taken from after the bäcklösa drinking water treatment plant s aeration stage to a biofilter for pretreatment for general water chemistry data see table s2 the biofilter consisted of a 1 5 m diameter 3 m high downflow filter containing a 1 5 m bed of norit gac1240w and had been in operation for approximately 6 months at the time of this work from the biofilter water was stored in a stainless steel feed tank 10 m3 before feedwater pumping into the 2 stage nf pilot the two stage membrane process utilized six membranes in stage one and three membranes in stage 2 nf90 400 dow filmtech membranes a constant feed water flowrate 8 m3 h 1 was pumped through a 5 µm pre filter consisting of seven elements ge infrastructure water and process technology purtrex 5 30 filter to remove any solids in the raw water before entering the nf unit concentrate internal recirculation to the feedwater inlet was provided at 6 m3 h 1 the biofilter pretreatment was intended to prevent manganese fouling of the nf membranes which had been a problem in previous work franke et al 2019 the nf process goal was pfas removal and reduction of uranium 238 doc and hardness from the raw water while providing concentrate water for the ff batch and continuous tests the nf pilot results reported are for 175 days of operation with 80 recovery and transmembrane pressure which increased from 4 2 to 5 5 bar with no cleaning of the membranes at the time of this work the 20 concentrate waste stream was directed to two 600 l polyethylene pe holding tanks with continuous overflow from which a smaller volume of concentrate was taken for the trial 1 and 2 ff tests antiscalant ameroyal 363 ashland corp usa was added to the feedwater to provide a concentration of 3 0 g m 3 in the feedwater before entering the nf samples were taken for the nf process raw water after biofilter nf feedwater nf permeate nf concentrate flowrates for feedwater concentrate recycle and concentrate along with inlet and outlet pressure and water temperature were continuously monitored and automatically logged 2 2 batch ff lab column testing ff testing in batch mode was performed using the setup shown in fig s2 using concentrate from the holding tanks removal of pfas from the concentrate using ff was evaluated with and without dosing of the co surfactants listed in table 1 to determine if pfas removal could be enhanced a 1000 ml surfactant stock solution of 1 1 mm was prepared for each surfactant using ultrapure water milli q iq 7000 before each set of tests and mixed for 10 min using a magnetic stirrer concentrate was collected in 25 l polyethylene high density pe hd plastic containers from the concentrate holding tanks and used to fill the lab scale ff test column after filling the column with concentrate the air pump jbl model a100 introduced air into the bottom of the glass ff column inner diameter 52 mm height 550 mm saveen and werner through a sintered glass filter creating bubbles which moved upwards through the water column airflow was measured through a rotameter zyia instrument company fl3 1 and maintained approximately 1 l min 1 to determine a minimum dose for each surfactant a series of pre tests were performed to determine the surfactant dose required to form a foam cushion approximately 2 cm above the water level after all runs the column was rinsed with tap water until no surfactant bubbles were evident then rinsed and filled with ultrapure water shaken then emptied after determination of the minimum dose single runs were made using no surfactant the minimum dosage two and five times the minimum dose table s4 for the 4 surfactants for a total of 16 experimental runs for each run the column was filled with 250 ml the desired co surfactant dose was added using a plastic pipette air bubbles were introduced at 1 7 l min 1 foam forming on the water surface was removed from the column using a vacuum pump gast model doa p504 bn with silicone suction tube inserted from the top of the column for a period of 2 to 3 min until the water level in the column was reduced to 200 ml the column water was emptied directly into 250 ml polyethylene high density pe hd plastic sample bottles foamate was emptied from the foam collection bottle directly into 250 ml pe hd sample bottles the sampled foamate volumes were weighed using a mettler toledo scale model pb602 s fact and ultrapure water added to provide 250 ml of sample for analysis by a commercial laboratory als ov 34aq between each run the column and foam collection bottle were rinsed with tap water until no surfactant bubbles were evident then filled with ultrapure water shaken then emptied the column was then inverted and any water remaining in the sintered glass filter was blow out using the air pump for approximately 2 min samples were taken of both the ultrapure and tap water table s5 for pfas analysis to detect pfas contamination of the experiment 2 3 continuous ff pilot column testing continuous tests using zero co surfactant minimum dose two and three times the minimum dose of the cationic surfactant montaline c40 were run each test in triplicate for a total of 12 runs montaline c40 was utilized in the continuous testing since it was assessed as the most effective surfactant based on the trial 1 testing the ff column shown in fig 1 was operated with air flow counter

model doa p504 bn with silicone suction tube inserted through a sampling port retentate samples were collected from the exit tube at 5 10 and 20 min intervals untreated concentrate samples were taken directly from the holding tanks and column sample before the start of the experiment and foamate was sampled directly from the foamate collection flask at the end of the runs the untreated concentrate

the surfactant dose and surfactant to pfas mole ratio for each of the 12 runs samples were taken of both the ultrapure and tap water table s5 trial 2 test parameters were selected based on experience from previous ff treatment of landfill leachate mccleaf et al 2021 2 4 aerosol release from the continuous ff pilot column two additional continuous runs were made to determine the impact of pfas escape via aerosols from the column in trial 2 an aerosol water trap containing ultrapure water with a pfas concentration below the lod was utilized to detect if pfas was leaving the column as an aerosol the column was operated at 4 l min 1 airflow without surfactant addition with the same operating conditions as other continuous ff tests except the vacuum pump was not used for foam collection and foam was allowed to accumulate at the surface of the water column the outlet at the top of the column was closed and exhaust air from the top of the column was led via pe tubing to the water trap consisting of a 250 ml hdpe sample bottle the foam level was monitored so as insure only exhaust air and not foam entered the exhaust tubing new water trap bottles were used for each test at three time intervals 0 5 5 10 and 10 20 min and water analyzed for pfas to determine if pfas had been transferred as aerosols from the column exhaust air to the water trap 2 5 sampling and analysis samples were refrigerated at 8 c then shipped to als scandinavian located in stockholm sweden for pfas analysis als ov 34aq using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms for quality assurance one blank sample one spiked sample and one duplicate sample was analyzed for every 20 samples thirty four pfas compounds were included in the laboratory analysis as listed in table s1 for the determination of pfas removal calculations and graphing the pfas results with concentrations lower than the lod were treated as having the value of half the lod which is recognized to introduce bias into calculated removal efficiencies but still indicates the effectiveness of the removal process general chemical analysis for samples from the nf and biofilter pilot were performed by uppsala water and waste ltd s certified water laboratory for the water quality parameters included in table s2 general chemical analysis for the ff experiments was performed by als scandinavian als gv 3 for water quality parameters included in table s7 the removal efficiency was calculated as shown in the following equation 1 removal efficiency 100 c c o where c is the pfas concentration in the nf permeate trial 1 batch column water or the trial 2 continuous exit water ng l 1 c0 is the untreated concentration ng l 1 in the nf feedwater or before the start of the trial 1 batch test or the water entering the trial 2 continuous process for trial 1 and trial 2 the average pfas concentration of the holding tank water was used for co contact time ct for the water in the in the continuous column tests was calculated using the following equation 2 c t v o l u m e f l o w r a t e where c t is the contact time min volume is the volume of water in the column l and the flowrate l min 1 mole ratio co surfactant to pfas in the untreated concentrate was calculated using the following equation 3 m o l e r a t i o s u r f a c t a n t t o pfas m o l e s s u r f a t a n t t o t a l m o l e s p f a s a v g where moles surfactant is the moles of surfactant added to the concentrate tested in the column moles pfasavg is the total average moles of pfas detected in the untreated concentrate for trial 1 sample point 6 and for trial 2 sample point 7 respectively the moles of each individual pfas table 3 were calculated based on their individual concentration and the resulting individual mole values added to give the total moles pfas for trial 1 and 2 if concentrations were below the lod one half of the lod was assumed for that individual pfas 3 results and discussion 3 1 nf pilot the two stage nf pilot reduced the pfas concentration in the nf feedwater by 98 from a total of approximately 77 to 1 4 ng l 1 table s8 and reduced water hardness by 44 uranium 238 by 97 and doc from 2 7 to 1 mg l 1 table s2 total and individual pfas removal efficiencies table s8 are similar to the results given in zhi et al 2022 and liu et al 2022 for nf90 membranes while the overall removal efficiency of 98 is the same as found for a two stage membrane process using nf90 and nf270 membrane franke et al 2021 the greatest pfas removal efficiency was found for pfos c8 with 99 followed by pfhxa pfhxs and pfpes with 97 pfoa and by pfbs with 96 pfpea 93 and pfhpa 89 if half the lod is assumed for permeate values below lod the pfas4 concentration was reduced from approximately 56 to 1 ng l 1 if zero is assumed for individual pfas which were below the lod for all samples taken the concentrate averaged 393 ng l 1 total detectable pfas concentration which is 5 times greater than for the feedwater which is expected with a permeate recovery of 80 the pfas concentration of the water used in ff testing for trial 1 and trial 2 are shown in table 3 3 2 trial 1 batch ff results the pfas removal efficiency for ff without co surfactant addition averaged 78 4 with greater than 94 removal efficiency for pfoa pfhxs and pfos as shown in table s9 comparison of the four surfactants tested indicates table s10 the greatest increase in total pfas removal efficiency was provided by the cationic surfactant montaline c40 with 17 increase while marlinat 242 28 provided 2 increase simulsol sl 10 4 increase and las 3 decrease fig 2 fig s3 as shown in fig 2 removal efficiency improved with increased dosage of the co surfactant montaline c40 with an increase of 67 59 83 and 44 respectively for pfpea pfhxa pfbs and pfpes at the maximum dosage of the co surfactant longer chain pfas pfoa pfhxs and pfos had greater than 95 removal efficiency without the addition of co surfactant improved removal of pfas with a cationic co surfactant corresponds with the findings yueh feng et al 2021 for wastewater improvement of removal specifically for pfpea pfhxa pfbs and pfpes with cationic co surfactant addition confirms the findings of vo et al 2023 for landfill leachate similar to vo et al 2023 the removal of pfba appears not to be improved or even negatively affected by the addition of the cationic co surfactant based on the results from trial 1 the cationic co surfactant montaline c40 was chosen for trial 2 due the improvement in removal efficiency for the pfas with perfluorocarbon chain c4 through c6 which provided a greater total pfas removal efficiency 3 3 trial 2 continuous ff results as shown in fig 3 the maximum dosage of cationic co surfactant increased removal for pfpea to 59 pfhxa to 99 and pfbs to 96 with removal efficiencies increasing with increasing dose of co surfactant pfoa pfpes pfhxs pfos had greater than 99 removal efficiency without the addition of co surfactant similar to trial 1 removal of pfba appears not to be improved by the addition of the cationic co surfactant average removal efficiency for the three runs for each co surfactant dose is shown in table s11 along with pfas concentration in the effluent water and foamate the average removal of 90 with air alone and 94 the maximum cationic co surfactant dose is greater than the 81 removal reported by dai et al 2019 76 by mccleaf et al 2021 and 60 for smith et al 2022 for ff of landfill leachate the greater average removal achieved in the present study however cannot be credited to a greater relative makeup of long chain pfas which are more hydrophobic and better removed by ff than short chains the present study s 70 long chain makeup is less than dai et al 2019 s reported 90 long chain makeup and mccleaf et al 2021 s reported 80 the better removal efficiency may be due to the polymer based nf antiscalant chemical used for chelation with metal ions e g ca 2 and mg 2 and dispersion of microcrystal particles to prevent scaling yu et al 2020 of the nf membrane due to size exclusion the antiscalant polymer which is typically greater than 2000 daltons remains on the membrane s concentrate side the antiscalant polymer in the concentrate may increase the hydrophobicity of the pfas due to charge interactions between the polymer and pfas molecule thereby making ff removal more effective a common thread between these studies and the present work is higher removal efficiency of individual long chain pfoa pfhxs pfos than for short chain pfas which is also reported for ff treatment of afff contaminated groundwater and for pfos in wastewater buckley et al 2021 meng et al 2018 as shown in table s11 the total pfas removal efficiency for all three co surfactant doses was 93 by the 5 min sampling time which indicates removal is initiated quickly the no dose runs averaged 89 90 1 for the 5 10 and 20 min sampling times while for the maximum dosage of 4 500 mole ratio co surfactant to total untreated pfas achieved 94 1 an increase of 4 which is attained chiefly by improved removal of the c4 c5 perfluorocarbon pfas 3 4 trial 1 batch mode and trial 2 continuous mode foamate collection parameters as shown in tables s12 and s13 the foam to water ratio fwr averaged 26 for trial 1 batch mode and 11 for trial 2 continuous mode which can be compared to the 21 22 robey et al 2020 mccleaf et al 2021 reported for ff for pfas removal from landfill leachate the trial 1 foam average enrichment factor 2 5 and trial 2 factor of 7 7 is less than the 8400 enrichment factor of meng et al 2018 which was attained using a non ionic hydrocarbon surfactant to enhance removal but similar to the factor of 3 7 reported by robey et al 2020 and 2 9 from mccleaf et al 2021 for landfill leachate where no co surfactants were added the greater foam to water ratio and lower foam enrichment factor for trial 1 compared to trial 2 is indicative of the improved removal efficiency provided by trial 2 s higher water column 1 m depth versus in trial 1 s 12 cm depth and trial 2 s longer contact time of 20 min compared to 2 3 min in trial 1 pfas foamate recovery averaged 66 with decreasing foamate recovery with increasing co surfactant dose for trial 1 and averaged 82 for trial 2 and appeared not correlated to co surfactant dose the average pfas mass balance of 78 for trial 1 and 89 for trial 2 is greater than the 72 reported by mccleaf et al 2021 for landfill leachate for trial 1 the decreasing enrichment factor and foamate pfas recovery with increasing co surfactant dose may be due to that greater dosage of co surfactant resulted in pfas more readily adhering to the walls of the ff column thereby not being included in the mass balance analysis of the aerosol trap water during trial 2 indicated that pfos was captured and averaged 0 5 0 2 ng l 1 for the for the two aerosol runs with a total of six samples all other pfas were below the lod this indicates that aerosols are created by the study s ff process as has been established for aeration processes by ahrens et al 2011 however the trial 2 s utilization of vacuum collection of the foam or the greater column height 200 cm versus 55 cm in trial 2 may mitigate aerosol release from the column smith et al 2022 resulting in higher foamate recovery for trial 2 than trial 1 this raises the possibility of the release of more volatile pfas such as ftsas and ftohs which were not analyzed in this work similarly the variability in the removal efficiency of short chained pfba and pfpea compared to the other pfas in trial 1 standard deviation 41 and 26 respectively table s9 and compared to the variability in trial 2 efficiencies table s11 may also be attributable to aerosolization the fate of the co surfactants in trial 1 and 2 was not investigated however the co surfactants may be partly captured during the ff process in the foamate while residual co surfactant may remain in the ff retentate release of co surfactant into the environment could be problematic for example montaline 40 the cationic co surfactant in trial 2 is readily biodegradable with low bioaccumulation potential however the maximum dosage of 1 600 µg l 1 in trial 2 is only slightly lower than the lethal concentration 50 lc50 of 1 7 to 5 mg l 1 for fresh water fish and is in general considered very toxic to aquatic life sds montaline c40 4 conclusions and future work based on results of the present work the novel combination of nf for drinking water treatment coupled with ff for concentrate treatment was able to reduce total detectable pfas in the permeate from approximately 77 ng l 1 to approximately 1 4 0 4 and pfas4 from 56 ng l 1 to 1 0 0 2 ng l 1 so as to comply with more stringent drinking water regulations for example less than 4 ng l 1 in sweden and less than 2 ng l 1 in denmark for pfas4 pfoa pfna pfhxs and pfos additionally the continuous ff treatment of the pfas laden concentrate using air alone appears to effectively remove pfas from concentrate water by approximately 90 1 the work confirmed nf coupled with ff for concentrate treatment is a viable treatment process train for municipal water providers who are required to meet lower regulatory limits for pfas in drinking water while addressing the discharge of pfas back into the environment the addition of a cationic co surfactant to the concentrate before ff increased the pfas removal via ff to 94 the ff process with air alone appears to provide effective pfas removal for longer chained pfas wherein pfoa pfpes pfhxs pfos each attained 99 removal efficiency addition of the cationic co surfactant increased removal efficiencies for shorter chain pfas specifically by 37 for pfpea 9 for pfhxa 34 for pfbs resulting in 59 99 and 96 removal efficiency respectively removal of pfba appeared not to be positively affected by addition of co surfactant possibly due to the shorter chain length being less amenable to interaction with the longer chained co surfactant for the nf process greatest rejection was found for pfos with 99 followed by pfhxa pfhxs and pfpes with 97 pfoa and pfbs with 96 pfpea 93 and pfhpa 89 which is similar to the results found by others and has been associated with the size exclusion mechanism inherent for membrane processes i e larger molecular weight molecules are more effectively rejected based on the trial 1 batch results the cationic co surfactant montaline c40 was found to improve removal efficiency of pfas from the nf concentrate by 17 compared to an increase of 2 for an anionic surfactant marlinat 242 28 increase of 4 for a non ionic surfactant simulsol sl 10 and decrease of 3 for an anionic surfactant las the pfas with greatest improvement in removal efficiency using ff with the cationic co surfactant were pfpea pfhxa pfbs and pfpes with increases of 67 59 83 and 44 respectively the improved removal efficiency may be due to the interaction of the cationic co surfactant s positive charged head group with the short chain pfas negatively charged head group leading to increased hydrophobicity and better removal with ff the study s overall results for nf combined with continuous ff for concentrate treatment is depicted in fig 4 which illustrates process flow streams relative volumes and pfas concentrations afforded by the process the study s treatment of nf concentrate using ff results in approximately 2 of the nf feedwater volume being captured as foamate with greater than 3 000 ng l 1 pfas this volume could be further decreased if secondary and tertiary ff is applied burns et al 2021 buckley et al 2022 which would be more amenable to destruction techniques such as electrochemical oxidation or evaporation with incineration of residual solids the retentate from the continuous ff process was approximately 18 of the nf feedwater and had a pfas concentration of 35 ng l 1 which decreased with application of the cationic co surfactant to 21 ng l 1 as shown in fig 4 the makeup of the retentate is predominantly composed of pfba pfbs pfpea and pfhxa short chain pfas as opposed to the greater long chain makeup of the nf feedwater polishing of the ff retentate may be achieved using anion exchange with specialized resin optimized for short chain pfas removal in any case the removal of 90 of the pfas in the ff foamate decreases the mass of pfas required to be polished from the retentate before release to the environment which should reduce operation costs of resin regeneration future work should concentrate on investigation of ff process parameters the effects of co surfactants and additional cationic co surfactants of different chain lengths or membrane antiscalant chemicals that improve the pfas removal efficiency of the ff process for membrane concentrate and are environmentally friendly and low cost the trade off of using co surfactants for pfas removal while affecting overall water quality should be investigated along with the fate and toxicity of the co surfactants the application of ff in series should be developed for a continuous process for flowrates associated with concentrate streams from full scale nf ro applications along with pfas destruction technologies for ff foamate such as electrochemical oxidation polishing processes for ff retentate for example tailored aix resins should be further developed

15052,per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas are recognized as persistent pollutants that have been found in drinking water sources on a global scale semi permeable membrane treatment processes such as reverse osmosis and nanofiltration nf have been shown effective at removing pfas however disposal of pfas laden concentrate is problematic without treatment of the concentrate pfas is released into the environment the present work examined a novel pfas removal scheme for drinking water using nf filtration with treatment of the resulting nf concentrate via foam fractionation ff with and without co surfactants the nf pilot removed 98 of pfas from afff contaminated groundwater producing permeate with 1 4 ng l 1 total pfas using ff resulted in pfas removal efficiency of 90 from the nf concentrate and with improved removal of 94 with addition of cationic co surfactant the resulting foamate composed approximately 2 of the nf feedwater volume and contained greater than 3000 ng l 1 pfas or 41 times greater than the nf feedwater addition of the cationic co surfactant to the ff process resulted in increased removal efficiency of the shorter chain pfas specifically 37 for pfpea 9 for pfhxa and 34 for pfbs thus attaining 59 99 and 96 removal efficiency respectively pfoa pfpes pfhxs pfos each attained 99 ff removal with or without co surfactant addition graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pfas foam fractionation nanofiltration drinking water concentrate treatment techniques data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas have been found in drinking water sources throughout the world ericson et al 2009 post et al 2012 appleman et al 2014 rahman et al 2014 gyllenhammar et al 2015 and due to health based effects lower acceptable limits for pfas in drinking water have been implemented or proposed in europe and the u s usepa 2016a usepa 2016b eu 2020 federal register 2022 for example in sweden slv 2022 the proposed action limit is 4 ng l 1 for the sum of four pfas pfas4 namely pfna pfoa pfhxs and pfos and a limit of 100 ng l 1 for the sum of twenty one pfas pfas21 table s1 lists these twenty one even more challenging is denmark s regulation of 2 ng l 1 for pfas4 dmoe 2021 fortunately reverse osmosis ro and nanofiltration nf have been shown effective at reducing pfas concentrations by 90 99 appleman et al 2013 wang et al 2018 franke et al 2019 soriano et al 2020 2021 lee et al 2022 thereby providing a method to lower pfas concentrations to the required limits unfortunately for pfas contaminated feedwater ro and nf produce a pfas laden concentrate with typical concentrate volumes being 10 20 of the feedwater with 5 10 times greater pfas concentration which must be treated before discharge or managed so as not to contaminate the environment tow et al 2021 franke et al 2021 usepa 2022 hvmfs 2019 the present work examines using nf treatment to meet lower pfas limits in drinking water while utilizing foam fractionation ff for removal of pfas from nf concentrate thereby allowing safe concentrate discharge into the environment no reports of ff treatment for pfas removal from nf concentrate have been published to the authors knowledge however ff has been shown to be effective at removing pfas from landfill leachate wastewater and contaminated groundwater meng et al 2018 dai et al 2019 robey et al 2020 mccleaf et al 2021 smith et al 2022 whereas nf can reliably remove pfas from even relatively dilute pfas contaminated source waters to low levels in the permeate ff is not typically efficient unless applied on waters with higher concentrations of pfas and thus may be more effectively used for treatment of nf concentrate than source water another advantage of using ff on the nf concentrate as opposed to directly on the source water is that smaller volumes would need to be treated thereby reducing the size and complexity of the ff process installation one of the present work s key research questions is to determine if the pfas level in nf concentrate is high enough to make ff a good removal process for treating nf concentrate ff utilizes the surface active molecules found in the liquid which attach to the gas liquid interface of the bubbles and form a foam on the liquid surface burghoff 2012a burghoff 2012b the process can be run in batch or continuous mode and foam once removed from the retentate and collapsed is referred to as foamate while the treated liquid as retentate process parameters such as ph gas flow rate temperature bubble size and additives have been investigated merz et al 2011 chai et al 1998 fanaie et al 2020 ff has the added benefit that due to the resulting low volume highly concentrated pfas foamate destructive techniques can be more efficiently applied such as advanced chemical oxidation plasma based treatment chemical reduction electrochemical oxidation supercritical water oxidation sonochemical methods or incineration lu et al 2020 tow et al 2021 banks et al 2020 li et al 2019 mahinroosta et al 2020 laboratory and bench scale application of ff for pfas removal has been reported with average removal efficiencies ranging from of 20 to 100 for spiked lab scale studies and for contaminated landfill leachate and groundwater robey et al 2020 mccleaf et al 2021 smith et al 2022 buckley et al 2021 burns et al 2021 2022 a common finding is removal efficiency of over 90 for individual long chain pfas but with lower removal efficiency for short chain pfas in lab studies the addition of co surfactants has been shown enhance pfas removal from wastewater landfill leachate and contaminated groundwater meng et al 2018 taseidifar 2020 buckley et al 2022 yueh feng et al 2021 reported enhanced pfoa removal efficiency from wastewater using cationic surfactants and postulated that cationic surfactants with a linear alkyl chain with the same number of carbons in the chain are the best flotation aids for pfoa the addition of a co surfactant has been reported to decrease the critical micelle concentration cmc and create a more active surface especially for surfactants with the same carbon chain length tian et al 2017 regev et al 1996 vo et al 2023 found in lab scale that cationic and zwitterionic co surfactants improved removal of short chain pfas from landfill leachate due to charge interaction with oppositely charged pfas functional groups the present study is unique in that removal of pfas from contaminated municipal groundwater was investigated for the novel combination of nf for drinking water treatment coupled with ff for treatment of the resulting nf concentrate the removal efficiency of a nf pilot using full scale membranes was monitored for almost 6 months using feedwater from pfas contaminated wellfields the concentrate collected from this nf pilot was used to investigate the efficiency of ff for treating nf concentrate in two trials trial 1 consisted of batch lab scale testing of ff with and without the addition of a co surfactant aid four co surfactants cationic two anionic non ionic were tested with three different dosages trial 2 consisted of determining pfas removal efficiency of continuous pilot scale ff with and without addition of the co surfactant determined as most effective in trial 1 three different surfactant dosages were tested each in triplicate the efficiency and selectivity of ff for removal of the eight pfas compounds found in the concentrate were determined along with improved efficiency afforded by the co surfactant the work addressed the specific conditions encountered for designing a future full scale nf facility at uppsala water and waste ltd s bäcklösa drinking water treatment plant to meet the drinking water goal of pfas4 4 ng l 1 slv 2022 while preventing the discharge of pfas laden concentrate to the lake malaren sweden s largest source of raw drinking water 2 materials and methods the treatment setup investigated in the work shown is shown in fig s1 with water quality sampling points eight pfas of the thirty four pfas analyzed table s1 were found above limit of detection lod concentrations in the raw water fed to the nf pilot specifically pfpea pfhxa pfhpa pfoa pfbs pfpes pfhxs and pfos 2 1 nanofiltration nf pilot raw water from the municipal wellfield was diverted to the nf membrane pilot after the aeration stage at the bäcklösa drinking water treatment plant in uppsala sweden the nf pilot as shown in fig s1 consisted of a constant pumped flow of approximately 10 m3 h 1 taken from after the bäcklösa drinking water treatment plant s aeration stage to a biofilter for pretreatment for general water chemistry data see table s2 the biofilter consisted of a 1 5 m diameter 3 m high downflow filter containing a 1 5 m bed of norit gac1240w and had been in operation for approximately 6 months at the time of this work from the biofilter water was stored in a stainless steel feed tank 10 m3 before feedwater pumping into the 2 stage nf pilot the two stage membrane process utilized six membranes in stage one and three membranes in stage 2 nf90 400 dow filmtech membranes a constant feed water flowrate 8 m3 h 1 was pumped through a 5 µm pre filter consisting of seven elements ge infrastructure water and process technology purtrex 5 30 filter to remove any solids in the raw water before entering the nf unit concentrate internal recirculation to the feedwater inlet was provided at 6 m3 h 1 the biofilter pretreatment was intended to prevent manganese fouling of the nf membranes which had been a problem in previous work franke et al 2019 the nf process goal was pfas removal and reduction of uranium 238 doc and hardness from the raw water while providing concentrate water for the ff batch and continuous tests the nf pilot results reported are for 175 days of operation with 80 recovery and transmembrane pressure which increased from 4 2 to 5 5 bar with no cleaning of the membranes at the time of this work the 20 concentrate waste stream was directed to two 600 l polyethylene pe holding tanks with continuous overflow from which a smaller volume of concentrate was taken for the trial 1 and 2 ff tests antiscalant ameroyal 363 ashland corp usa was added to the feedwater to provide a concentration of 3 0 g m 3 in the feedwater before entering the nf samples were taken for the nf process raw water after biofilter nf feedwater nf permeate nf concentrate flowrates for feedwater concentrate recycle and concentrate along with inlet and outlet pressure and water temperature were continuously monitored and automatically logged 2 2 batch ff lab column testing ff testing in batch mode was performed using the setup shown in fig s2 using concentrate from the holding tanks removal of pfas from the concentrate using ff was evaluated with and without dosing of the co surfactants listed in table 1 to determine if pfas removal could be enhanced a 1000 ml surfactant stock solution of 1 1 mm was prepared for each surfactant using ultrapure water milli q iq 7000 before each set of tests and mixed for 10 min using a magnetic stirrer concentrate was collected in 25 l polyethylene high density pe hd plastic containers from the concentrate holding tanks and used to fill the lab scale ff test column after filling the column

which moved upwards through the water column airflow was measured through a rotameter zyia instrument company fl3 1 and maintained approximately 1 l min 1 to determine a minimum dose for each surfactant a series of pre tests were performed to determine the surfactant dose required to form a foam cushion approximately 2 cm above the water level after all runs the column was rinsed with tap water until no surfactant bubbles were evident then rinsed and filled with ultrapure water shaken then emptied after determination of the minimum dose single runs were made using no surfactant the minimum dosage two and five times the minimum dose table s4 for the 4 surfactants for a total of 16 experimental runs for each run the column was filled with 250 ml the desired co surfactant dose was added using a plastic pipette air bubbles were introduced at 1 7 l min 1 foam forming on the water surface was removed from the column using a vacuum pump gast model doa p504 bn with silicone suction tube inserted from the top of the column for a period of 2 to 3 min until the water level in the column was reduced to 200 ml the column water was emptied directly into 250 ml polyethylene high density pe hd plastic sample bottles foamate was emptied from the foam collection bottle directly into 250 ml pe hd sample bottles the sampled foamate volumes were weighed using a mettler toledo scale model pb602 s fact and ultrapure water added to provide 250 ml of sample for analysis by a commercial laboratory als ov 34aq between each run the column and foam collection bottle were rinsed with tap water until no surfactant bubbles were evident then filled with ultrapure water shaken then emptied the column was then inverted and any water remaining in the sintered glass filter was blow out using the air pump for approximately 2 min samples were taken of both the ultrapure and tap water table s5 for pfas analysis to detect pfas contamination of the experiment 2 3 continuous ff pilot column testing continuous tests using zero co surfactant minimum dose two and three times the minimum dose of the cationic surfactant montaline c40 were run each test in triplicate for a total of 12 runs montaline c40 was utilized in the continuous testing since it was assessed as the most effective surfactant based on the trial 1 testing the ff column shown in fig 1 was operated with air flow counter

the surfactant dose and surfactant to pfas mole ratio for each of the 12 runs samples were taken of both the ultrapure and tap water table s5 trial 2 test parameters were selected based on experience from previous ff treatment of landfill leachate mccleaf et al 2021 2 4 aerosol release from the continuous ff pilot column two additional continuous runs were made to determine the impact of pfas escape via aerosols from the column in trial 2 an aerosol water trap containing ultrapure water with a pfas concentration below the lod was utilized to detect if pfas was leaving the column as an aerosol the column was operated at 4 l min 1 airflow without surfactant addition with the same operating conditions as other continuous ff tests except the vacuum pump was not used for foam collection and foam was allowed to accumulate at the surface of the water column the outlet at the top of the column was closed and exhaust air from the top of the column was led via pe tubing to the water trap consisting of a 250 ml hdpe sample bottle the foam level was monitored so as insure only exhaust air and not foam entered the exhaust tubing new water trap bottles were used for each test at three time intervals 0 5 5 10 and 10 20 min and water analyzed for pfas to determine if pfas had been transferred as aerosols from the column exhaust air to the water trap 2 5 sampling and analysis samples

one blank sample one spiked sample and one duplicate sample was analyzed for every 20 samples thirty four pfas compounds were included in the laboratory analysis as listed in table s1 for the determination of pfas removal calculations and graphing the pfas results with concentrations lower than the lod were treated as having the value of half the lod which is recognized to introduce bias into calculated removal efficiencies but still indicates the effectiveness of the removal process general chemical analysis for samples from the nf and biofilter pilot were performed by uppsala water and waste ltd s certified water laboratory for the water quality parameters included in table s2 general chemical analysis for the ff experiments was performed by als scandinavian als gv 3 for water quality parameters included in table s7 the removal efficiency was calculated as shown in the following equation 1 removal efficiency 100 c c o where c is the pfas concentration in the nf permeate trial 1 batch column water or the trial 2 continuous exit water ng l 1 c0 is the untreated concentration ng l 1 in the nf feedwater or before the start of the trial 1 batch test or the water entering the trial 2 continuous process for trial 1 and trial 2 the average pfas concentration of the holding tank water was used for co contact time ct for the water in the in the continuous column tests was calculated using the following equation 2 c t v o l u m e f l o w r a t e where c t is the contact time min volume is the volume of water in the column l and the flowrate l min 1 mole ratio co surfactant to pfas in the untreated concentrate was calculated using the following equation 3 m o l e r a t i o s u r f a c t a n t t o pfas m o l e s s u r f a t a n t t o t a l m o l e s p f a s a v

sample point 6 and for trial 2 sample point 7 respectively the moles of each individual pfas table 3 were calculated based on their individual concentration and the resulting individual mole values added to give the total moles pfas for trial 1 and 2 if concentrations were below the lod one half of the lod was assumed for that individual pfas 3 results and discussion 3 1 nf pilot the two stage nf pilot reduced the pfas concentration in the nf feedwater by 98 from a total of approximately 77 to 1 4 ng l 1 table s8 and reduced water hardness by 44 uranium 238 by 97 and doc from 2 7 to 1 mg l 1 table s2 total and individual pfas removal efficiencies table s8 are similar to the results given in zhi et al 2022 and liu et al 2022 for nf90 membranes while the overall removal efficiency of 98 is the same as found for a two stage membrane process using nf90 and nf270 membrane franke et al 2021 the greatest pfas removal efficiency was found for pfos c8 with 99 followed by pfhxa pfhxs and pfpes with 97 pfoa and by pfbs with 96 pfpea 93 and pfhpa 89 if half the lod is assumed for permeate values below lod the pfas4 concentration was reduced from approximately 56 to 1 ng l 1 if zero is assumed for individual pfas which were below the lod for all samples taken the concentrate averaged 393 ng l 1 total detectable pfas concentration which is 5 times greater than for the feedwater which is expected with a permeate recovery of 80 the pfas concentration of the water used in ff testing for trial 1 and trial 2 are shown in table 3 3 2 trial 1 batch ff results the pfas removal efficiency for ff without co surfactant addition averaged 78 4 with greater than 94 removal efficiency for pfoa pfhxs and pfos as shown in table s9 comparison of the four surfactants tested indicates table s10 the greatest increase in total pfas removal efficiency was provided by the cationic surfactant montaline c40 with 17 increase while marlinat 242 28 provided 2 increase simulsol sl 10 4 increase and las 3 decrease fig 2 fig s3 as shown in fig 2 removal efficiency improved with increased dosage of the co surfactant montaline c40 with an increase of 67 59 83 and 44 respectively for pfpea pfhxa pfbs and pfpes at the maximum dosage of the co surfactant longer chain pfas pfoa pfhxs and pfos had greater than 95 removal efficiency without the addition of co surfactant improved removal of pfas with a cationic co surfactant corresponds with the findings yueh feng et al 2021 for wastewater improvement of removal specifically for pfpea pfhxa pfbs and pfpes with cationic co surfactant addition confirms the findings of vo et al 2023 for landfill leachate similar to vo et al 2023 the removal of pfba appears not to be improved or even negatively affected by the addition of the cationic co surfactant based on the results from trial 1 the cationic co surfactant montaline c40 was chosen for trial 2 due the improvement in removal efficiency for the pfas with perfluorocarbon chain c4 through c6 which provided a greater total pfas removal efficiency 3 3 trial 2 continuous ff results as shown in fig 3 the maximum dosage of cationic co surfactant increased removal for pfpea to 59 pfhxa to 99 and pfbs to 96 with removal efficiencies increasing with increasing dose of co surfactant pfoa pfpes pfhxs pfos had greater than 99 removal efficiency without the addition of co surfactant similar to trial 1 removal of pfba appears not to be improved by the addition of the cationic co surfactant average removal efficiency for the three runs for each co surfactant dose is shown in table s11 along with pfas concentration in the effluent water and foamate the average removal of 90 with air alone and 94 the maximum cationic co surfactant dose is greater than the 81 removal reported by dai et al 2019 76 by mccleaf et al 2021 and 60 for smith et al 2022 for ff of landfill leachate the greater average removal achieved in the present study however cannot be credited to a greater relative makeup of long chain pfas which are more hydrophobic and better removed by ff than short chains the present study s 70 long chain makeup is less than dai et al 2019 s reported 90 long chain makeup and mccleaf et al 2021 s reported 80 the better removal efficiency may be due to the polymer based nf antiscalant chemical used for chelation with metal ions e g ca 2 and mg 2 and dispersion of microcrystal particles to prevent scaling yu et al 2020 of the nf membrane due to size exclusion the antiscalant polymer which is typically greater than 2000 daltons remains on the membrane s concentrate side the antiscalant polymer in the concentrate may increase the hydrophobicity of the pfas due to charge interactions between the polymer and pfas molecule thereby making ff removal more effective a common thread between these studies and the present work is higher removal efficiency of individual long chain pfoa pfhxs pfos than for short chain pfas which is also reported for ff treatment of afff contaminated groundwater and for pfos in wastewater buckley et al 2021 meng et al 2018 as shown in table s11 the total pfas removal efficiency for all three co surfactant doses was 93 by the 5 min sampling time which indicates removal is initiated quickly the no dose runs averaged 89 90 1 for the 5 10 and 20 min sampling times while for the maximum dosage of 4 500 mole ratio co surfactant to total untreated pfas achieved 94 1 an increase of 4 which is attained chiefly by improved removal of the c4 c5 perfluorocarbon pfas 3 4 trial 1 batch mode and trial 2 continuous mode foamate collection parameters as shown in tables s12 and s13 the foam to water ratio fwr averaged 26 for trial 1 batch mode and 11 for trial 2 continuous mode which can be compared to the 21 22 robey et al 2020 mccleaf et al 2021 reported for ff for pfas removal from landfill leachate the trial 1 foam average enrichment factor 2 5 and trial 2 factor of 7 7 is less than the 8400 enrichment factor of meng et al 2018 which was attained using a non ionic hydrocarbon surfactant to enhance removal but similar to the factor of 3 7 reported by robey et al 2020 and 2 9 from mccleaf et al 2021 for landfill leachate where no co surfactants were added the greater foam to water ratio and lower foam enrichment factor for trial 1 compared to trial 2 is indicative of the improved removal efficiency provided by trial 2 s higher water column 1 m depth versus in trial 1 s 12 cm depth and trial 2 s longer contact time of 20 min compared to 2 3 min in trial 1 pfas foamate recovery averaged 66 with decreasing foamate recovery with increasing co surfactant dose for trial 1 and averaged 82 for trial 2 and appeared not correlated to co surfactant dose the average pfas mass balance of 78 for trial 1 and 89 for trial 2 is greater than the 72 reported by mccleaf et al 2021 for landfill leachate for trial 1 the decreasing enrichment factor and foamate pfas recovery with increasing co surfactant dose may be due to that greater dosage of co surfactant resulted in pfas more readily adhering to the walls of the ff column thereby not being included in the mass balance analysis of the aerosol trap water during trial 2 indicated that pfos was captured and averaged 0 5 0 2 ng l 1 for the for the two aerosol runs with a total of six samples all other pfas were below the lod this indicates that aerosols are created by the study s ff process as has been established for aeration processes by ahrens et al 2011 however the trial 2 s utilization of vacuum collection of the foam or the greater column height 200 cm versus 55 cm in trial 2 may mitigate aerosol release from the column smith et al 2022 resulting in higher foamate recovery for trial 2 than trial 1 this raises the possibility of the release of more volatile pfas such as ftsas and ftohs which were not analyzed in this work similarly the variability in the removal efficiency of short chained pfba and pfpea compared to the other pfas in trial 1 standard deviation 41 and 26 respectively table s9 and compared to the variability in trial 2 efficiencies table s11 may also be attributable to aerosolization the fate of the co surfactants in trial 1 and 2 was not investigated however the co surfactants may be partly captured during the ff process in the foamate while residual co surfactant may remain in the ff retentate release of co surfactant into the environment could be problematic for example montaline 40 the cationic co surfactant in trial 2 is readily biodegradable with low bioaccumulation potential however the maximum dosage of 1 600 µg l 1 in trial 2 is only slightly lower than the lethal concentration 50 lc50 of 1 7 to 5 mg l 1 for fresh water fish and is in general considered very toxic to aquatic life sds montaline c40 4 conclusions and future work based on results of the present work the novel combination of nf for drinking water treatment coupled with ff for concentrate treatment was able to reduce total detectable pfas in the permeate from approximately 77 ng l 1 to approximately 1 4 0 4 and pfas4 from 56 ng l 1 to 1 0 0 2 ng l 1 so as to comply with more stringent drinking water regulations for example less than 4 ng l 1 in sweden and less than 2 ng l 1 in denmark for pfas4 pfoa pfna pfhxs and pfos additionally the continuous ff treatment of the pfas laden concentrate using air alone appears to effectively remove pfas from concentrate water by approximately 90 1 the work confirmed nf coupled with ff for concentrate treatment is a viable treatment process train for municipal water providers who are required to meet lower regulatory limits for pfas in drinking water while addressing the discharge of pfas back into the environment the addition of a cationic co surfactant to the concentrate before ff increased the pfas removal via ff to 94 the ff process with air alone appears to provide effective pfas removal for longer chained pfas wherein pfoa pfpes pfhxs pfos each attained 99 removal efficiency addition of the cationic co surfactant increased removal efficiencies for shorter chain pfas specifically by 37 for pfpea 9 for pfhxa 34 for pfbs resulting in 59 99 and 96 removal efficiency respectively removal of pfba appeared not to be positively affected by addition of co surfactant possibly due to the shorter chain length being less amenable to interaction with the longer chained co surfactant for the nf process greatest rejection was found for pfos with 99 followed by pfhxa pfhxs and pfpes with 97 pfoa and pfbs with 96 pfpea 93 and pfhpa 89 which is similar to the results found by others and has been associated with the size exclusion mechanism inherent for membrane processes i e larger molecular weight molecules are more effectively rejected based on the trial 1 batch results the cationic co surfactant montaline c40 was found to improve removal efficiency of pfas from the nf concentrate by 17 compared to an increase of 2 for an anionic surfactant marlinat 242 28 increase of 4 for a non ionic surfactant simulsol sl 10 and decrease of 3 for an anionic surfactant las the pfas with greatest improvement in removal efficiency using ff with the cationic co surfactant were pfpea pfhxa pfbs and pfpes with increases of 67 59 83 and 44 respectively the improved removal efficiency may be due to the interaction of the cationic co surfactant s positive charged head group with the short chain pfas negatively charged head group leading to increased hydrophobicity and better removal with ff the study s overall results for nf combined with continuous ff for concentrate treatment is depicted in fig 4 which illustrates process flow streams relative volumes and pfas concentrations afforded by the process the study s treatment of nf concentrate using ff results in approximately 2 of the nf feedwater volume being captured as foamate with greater than 3 000 ng l 1 pfas this volume could be further decreased if secondary and tertiary ff is applied burns et al 2021 buckley et al 2022 which would be more amenable to destruction techniques such as electrochemical oxidation or evaporation with incineration of residual solids the retentate from the continuous ff process was approximately 18 of the nf feedwater and had a pfas concentration of 35 ng l 1 which decreased with application of the cationic co surfactant to 21 ng l 1 as shown in fig 4 the makeup of the retentate is predominantly composed of pfba pfbs pfpea and pfhxa short chain pfas as opposed to the greater long chain makeup of the nf feedwater polishing of the ff retentate may be achieved using anion exchange with specialized resin optimized for short chain pfas removal in any case the removal of 90 of the pfas in the ff foamate decreases the mass of pfas required to be polished from the retentate before release to the environment which should reduce operation costs of resin regeneration future work should concentrate on investigation of ff process parameters the effects of co surfactants and additional cationic co surfactants of different chain lengths or membrane antiscalant chemicals that improve the pfas removal efficiency of the ff process for membrane concentrate and are environmentally friendly and low cost the trade off of using co surfactants for pfas removal while affecting overall water quality should be investigated along with the fate and toxicity of the co surfactants the application of ff in series should be developed for a continuous process for flowrates associated with concentrate streams from full scale nf ro applications along with pfas destruction technologies for ff foamate such as electrochemical oxidation polishing processes for ff retentate for example tailored aix resins should be further developed which are effective for high ionic strength applications to provide economical regeneration and avoid pfas discharge into the environment web references als ov 32aq perfluorinated compounds pfas 34

15053,the distribution and fate of microplastics in different water sources and their treatment plants seawater three municipal wastewaters a pharmaceutical factory wastewater and three drinking waters in france were studied currently research in this field is still under exploration since almost no relevant standards or policies have been introduced for the detection the removal or the discharge of microplastics this study used an improved quantitative and qualitative analytical methodology for microplastic detection by μ ftir carried out with simple analytical software by investigation wastewater was determined to contain the most abundant microplastics in quantity 4 203 42 000 mp l 1 then followed by surface water groundwater 153 19 836 mp l 1 and seawater around 420 mp l 1 polyethylene was the dominant material in almost all water types followed by polypropylene polystyrene and polyethylene terephthalate almost all treatment technologies could remove microplastics whatever the feed water types and concentration of microplastics though some treatment processes or transport pipes could cause additional contamination from microplastics the four wwtps

development and progress of society while bringing about potentially emerging contamination risks such as microplastics 0 1 μm 5 mm drummond et al 2022 public concern about microplastic transport and transfer ecological risks and chronic toxicity to living organisms have increased globally excessive production of plastics has risen over 20 fold over the last half century and is predicted to worsen up to at least by 2050 kahane rapport et al 2022 the widespread applications and improper disposal have contributed to the ubiquitous existence of plastic debris in diverse aquatic systems such as wastewater marine water freshwater etc luo et al 2019 specifically 95 99 of mps derived from discarded plastics could be found in raw wastewater and wastewater treatment plants wwtps which were the major receptors for microplastics derived from industries landfill domestic wastewater and stormwater wu et al 2022 the distribution and abundance of microplastic particles mps in wwtps are closely related to human activities and urban agglomeration chen et al 2020 abundance of mps in marine waters was demonstrated to range from tens to thousands of particles per cubic meter and most marine organisms are contaminated with up to hundreds of mps per individual bakir et al 2020 even in freshwater mps of polypropylene pp polyethylene pe polystyrene ps and polyethylene terephthalate pet have been frequently detected accounting for 70 of total mps li et al 2020 additionally the rivers lakes and even glaciers are all contaminated with microplastics for instance mps in lake geneva europe have surprisingly reached a concentration of 48 146 mp km 2 faure et al 2012 and the annual deposition flux of mps in demula glacier asia has been evaluated to 7640 720 to 9550 900 mps m 2 wang et al 2022 in view of environmental risks there is increased toxicity via compound contaminations due to the presence of microplastics and this poses a multitude of threats to humans and other living organisms microplastics most with hydrophobic surfaces probably act as carriers for toxic organic inorganic adsorption and microorganism growth yang et al 2022 more studies have illustrated that humans might be exposed to mps through inhalation ingestion and dermal contact and mps could be transported via blood huang et al 2022 na et al 2021 based on extensive investigations the quantity and spread of microplastic contaminations need to be further researched in order to find solutions to this pollution therefore it is necessary to explore the fate of mps in water treatment plants and investigate the removal efficiency of different treatment technologies on mps additionally the distribution of mps in concentration mp types and mp dimensions varied a lot even in the same water types bretas alvim et al 2020 simon et al 2018 different studies showed poor comparability because of the different detection methods and operation processes previous studies were mainly focused on individual stages in the assessment of mps while an analysis of all stages i e sample extraction processing identification quantification and transportation was required for a comprehensive understanding of the contamination caused by mps therefore an efficient and accurate detection methods for mps are necessary to investigate their distribution and transportation tin france the occurrence of mps in natural aqueous environments has hardly been mentioned and the removal of mps through treatment plants remains to be explored therefore this study was designed to investigate the distribution of mps in france with two main objectives 1 to obtain and compare the essential information on the distribution and abundance of mps from wastewater seawater surface water and underground water 2 to find out the footprint of mps in different water treatment plants and to calculate the related removal efficiency by each treatment process more precisely a reliable analytical method for mp identification and quantification by μ ftir with simple software developed in a previous work yang et al 2023 was adopted in this paper a three item characterization of mps counts dimensions and surface area types is possible with this method samples from wastewater treatment plants wwtps seawater treatment plants swtps and drinking water treatment plants dwtps were all investigated with the same analytical method to evaluate mp removal by primary secondary or tertiary treatment processes moreover the treatment by ultrafiltration uf membranes was particularly assessed this study gives information on microplastics contamination in france with a unified analytical method and in different water samples 2 material and methods 2 1 sample sources three types of water table 1 were analyzed in this study i samples from a swtp with the aim to treat seawater from shellfish farms and before discharge into the ocean by two main treatment routes as shown in fig 1 particularly in treatment route 2 two groups of 200 kda uf modules were located in different positions a semi industrial scale uf with more than 4 years of operation membrane area 9 m2 old uf and an industrial scale uf with less than 1 month operation membrane area 240 m2 new uf ii samples from four different wwtps sites and iii samples from three drinking water treatment plants dwtps to avoid external pollution all samples were collected and transported in 1 l pre cleaned glass bottles with 3 replicates and frozen at 20 c before analysis the bottles were closed immediately after sampling contact with the bottleneck and inner covers was prevented during sampling 2 2 analytical method the detection of mps developed in a previous work yang et al 2023 was achieved with a μ ftir imaging system with a spectrum spotlight 400 μ ftir microscope perkinelmer usa and coupled with simple freeware developed by aalborg university denmark and alfred wegener institute germany the turbidity of samples was tested in the laboratory with a turbidity meter turb 550 ir wtw germany a toc l instrument shimadzu japan based on the 680 c catalytic oxidation method was used to measure the concentration of total organic carbon toc the retention efficiency by membranes or removal efficiency by other treatments was determined as the decreased mps concentration compared to mps concentration in influent of the related treatment process shown in eq 1 1 e retention removal 1 c mps feed c mps effluent 100 where cmps feed represented mp concentration before treatment cmps effluent represents the mp concentration after treatment this equation was applied for mp concentration both in quantity and surface area 2 3 sample pretreatment the pretreatment of the samples was mainly described in table 2 the chemicals h2o2 30 w v fisher chemical koh 10 w v fisher chemical h2so4 1 10 fisher scientific and fenton reagent 0 05 m ii feso4 7h2 o with 30 h2o2 at a volume ratio of 1 1 were used for digestion at room temperature water quality toc concentration turbidity could give some guidelines for digestion requirement the digestion methods duration and dosing concentration was mainly based on the composition of samples of the waters in terms of organic matters and suspended solids ultrapure water and filtrated ethanol through 0 22 μm pes membranes were used for rinsing and cleaning and their contents in mps were assessed as well as airborne contamination plastic made devices or containers were avoided and glass devices or containers were pre cleaned with a selected rinsing solution whose positive control was carried out before use three types of filters 25 μm stain steal filters and 3 or 5 μm gold coated filters i3 trackpor p germany were used for mp collection before μ ftir imaging with a vacuum büchner funnel apparatus mp collection through filtration was operated in a cleaned fume hood with cotton lab coats worn at all times more detailed information on sampling digestion rinsing process and operational conditions can be found in the table 2 yang et al 2023 2 4 lab scale filtration of pe mps by uf membranes uf membranes were multichannel hollow fibers made of polyether sulfone pes alteon i suez aquasource france the molecular weight cut off mwco of the uf membrane was 200 kda with a pore size of 20 nm a uf module was built with one fiber which was composed of 7 channels with an inner diameter of 0 9 mm and installed into a ptfe external shell plugged with epoxy glue on both sides of the module allowing in out dead end filtration the module was 20 cm in length with a surface area of 3 96 10 3 m2 and a concentrate volume of 0 89 ml approximately polyethylene pe microspheres 10 150 μm cospheric usa were used to prepare 0 1 mg l 1 pe suspension as uf feed the dead end filtration test once for 1 l was operated inside out at a constant transmembrane pressure tmp of 0 3 bar the uf system pipes connections or containers contained no pe plastics before filtration uf membranes were rinsed with 1 l of ultrapure water 300 l m 2 under a tmp of 1 0 0 1 bar to remove the preservative agent glycerol each experiment was carried out on a new uf module the uf permeate was collected in pre cleaned glass bottles and immediately analyzed 3 results 3 1 microplastic retention by uf membrane at lab scale the investigation of uf membrane on pe mps retention at lab scale was operated as shown in fig 2 by identification pe was the main type of mp in 0 1mg l 1 pe synthetic suspensions shown in fig s1 in si the uf feed was confirmed by μ ftir to contain the most pe 90 together with a small amount of pp ps and pet in addition a few particles of pp and ps 5 mp l 1 totally also occurred in uf permeate it should be noted that the only mps considered in this part were pe mps for calculations to avoid the influences of airborne contamination and other secondary contamination on final results the 200 kda uf membrane achieved a 91 2 retention of mps in quantity resulting in only 18 mp l 1 in uf permeate the retention rate of mps in surface area reached more than 98 after all the lab scale study confirmed that uf membrane could effectively retain mps from inlet water and control the dimension distribution of pe mps in smaller ranges minor dimensions dmin 50 μm and major dimensions dmaj 150 μm additionally considering the multitude of mp types pe pp ps in uf feed and permeate the question was to know where these particles come from knowing that membrane integrity was checked airborne contamination uf plastic module and permeate pipe degradation more porous module cross section etc uf efficiency for mp removal at full scale will also be assessed in the following sections 3 2 microplastics retention in seawater treatment plant the publications on the presence of mps and their related hazards in marine environments have emerged exponentially but there was a lack of knowledge on the removal of mps in swtps a swtp with two treatment routes was sampled for this study fig 3 shows the distribution of mps in quantity and types together with the removal retention efficiency of mps at different stages of the treatment the top bottom order of water types marked on the y axis was consistent with the discharge sequence in swtp and the samples were named with the related treatment process notably the rules for making figures were kept for all samples taken from different water treatment plants in this study in addition the evolution of mps in surface area and in major and minor dimensions of samples are shown in figs 4 and s1 respectively in treatment route 1 and in view of quantity fig 3 the entire treatment process from seawater to 0 2 μm filter outlet provided 94 2 total removal rate of mps the zeo a uv zeolite a and uv process removed 63 4 of mps from seawater followed by 83 4 of removal by 1 μm cartridge while a 0 2 μm cartridge showed almost no removal of mps in quantity from a 1 μm outlet concerning surface area fig 4 the zeo a uv process showed negative removal i e increased mp surface area in zeo a uv outlet while a 1 μm cartridge and a 0 2 μm cartridge contributed to 97 8 and 44 28 removal of mps respectively under the same treatment process the different removal capacities of mps in quantity and surface area reflected the limits of expressing the results in mp l 1 alone for mps description giving the surface area and dimensions of mps is necessary for a more accurate description in treatment route 2 although zeo b uv outlet old uf feed and new uf feed provided increased mps concentration in quantity compared to seawater fig 3 they resulted in 42 5 60 11 0 removal of mps in surface area fig 4 respectively the zeo b uv outlet the old uf feed and the new uf feed concerned all samples treated by primary sedimentation 100 μm disk zeolite b process and zeo b uv outlet however the increased mps in quantity reflected external mps contaminations mainly by pa pe pp and ps in the paths from the effluent after the zeolite b uv process applied to the three sampling sites passed through different or transportation channels after partial removal of mps by treatment processes that is probably why they exhibited different microplastic concentrations both in quantity and in surface area nevertheless the following uf membranes especially the new uf exhibited excellent retention ability on mps both in quantity and surface area whatever the type of mps in the uf feeds the old uf and new uf respectively resulted in 74 1 and 96 2 retention of mps in quantity and 81 9 and 99 5 0 5 retention of mps in surface area around 130 mp l 1 was detected in old uf permeate and less than 21 mp l 1 were obtained in new uf permeate therefore the results indicated that uf membranes provided effective retention of mps from influent especially with recent uf membranes in general swtp treatment by 1 μm cartridge 0 2 μm cartridge and uf membranes all provided comparatively considerable removal or retention efficiency of mps while treatments with zeolite a uv and zeolite b uv posed potential contaminations of mps when treated with zeolite a uv fig 4 96 4 of pe particles in surface area occurred in the zeo a uv outlet while only 2 4 of pe occurred in seawater raw influent moreover the zeo a uv outlet was found with more and larger mps dmin 150 μm and dmaj 400 μm compared to that in seawater si fig s2 a b when treated with zeolite b uv an increase in the quantity of pa pe and pp particles in quantity was discovered in the zeo b uv outlet compared to seawater fig 3 since zeolites are the aluminosilicate members of microporous solids mainly consisting of silicon aluminum and oxygen jiang et al 2018 micro pollution such as mps could be blocked in the zeolite in long term use and without cleaning which could lead to secondary pollution of mps in the effluents this result emphasizes the need to pay more attention to the secondary contamination of microplastics which might come from the treatment processes in view of uf membranes both old and new uf showed good retention rates on mps in quantity and in surface area according to si fig s2 smaller mps between dmin 40 μm and dmaj 50 μm were discovered to be dominant in old uf permeate occupying 65 of total mps si fig s2 g meanwhile mps with dmin 80 μm and dmaj 200 μm were almost completely retained by both old uf and new uf membranes since the two uf modules were both 200 kda hollow fiber membranes made of pes the main difference was the duration of use it could be inferred that uf membranes themselves were not the polluting sources of mps according to the mp types in permeates while membrane aging could decrease the mps retention capacity especially on smaller particles dmin 40 μm and dmaj 50 μm additionally comparing the removal retention rates of mps in quantity fig 3 and surface area fig 4 by different treatment processes e g 1 μm cartridge 0 2 μm cartridge and uf membranes without ignorable external contaminations higher removal rates in total surface area were found compared to those in quantity this study is one of the first to report this finding but more verification is required in the following investigations together with further discussion for explanations 3 3 microplastics retention in wastewater treatment plants four different wwtps in france were sampled for mp analysis three of the wwtps wwtp 1 3 were built with secondary treatments and wwtp 4 was upgraded with uf as a tertiary treatment the distribution and removal retention of mps in quantity and surface area are shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively the distribution of major minor dimensions of mps in different wwtps is shown in fig s3 in terms of mp types pe was the main type of mps in municipal wwtps wwtp 2 4 and pa was predominant in the pharmaceutical wwtp 1 figs 5 and 6 in terms of concentration in quantity fig 5 the influent of pharmaceutical wwtp 1 contained around 4203 mp l 1 of mps while those of municipal wwtps were more loaded with mps ranging from 15 000 mp l 1 to 42 000 mp l 1 in municipal wwtps the removal rates of mps by activated sludge physico chemical biofiltration and mbr all achieved more than 88 removal fig 5 together with more than 97 removal of mps in surface area fig 6 focusing on membrane processes both mbrs in wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 showed good retention rates 88 95 in quantity and 97 98 in surface area for mps as mbr permeates in wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 respectively contained 190 mp l 1 and 5065 mp l 1 the mbr in wwtp 1 pore size of 0 02 μm was more effective for mp removal mbr in wwtp 2 showed weaker retention of mps than in wwtp 1 which might be caused by the bigger pore size of the membrane in wwtp 2 0 1 μm but also by 10 fold higher mp concentration both in quantity and surface area in influent of wwtp 2 although the retention rate of 200 kda uf in wwtp 4 72 in quantity and 72 in surface area was lower than secondary treatments in all wwtps 88 uf membranes provided the lowest mps concentration both in quantity 35 mp l 1 and surface area the relatively lower retention rates by uf were mainly due to the reduced mps concentrations in uf feed finally even if the concentration of mps varied greatly in raw wastewater all secondary treatments provided considerable removal efficiency on mps both in quantity and surface area however although the mps removal by secondary treatment was quite effective the residual mps in secondary effluents ranging from 128 mp l 1 to 5065 mp l 1 still needed more treatment thereby the uf membrane would be recommended as an effective treatment for mps after secondary treatment to better control the mp concentrations quantity and surface area at lower levels in view of dimensions fig s3 the dimensions of mps in mbr effluent and uf permeate were smaller than that in activated sludge or biofiltration process effluent particularly 200 kda uf in wwtp 4 controlled mps within a much smaller range dmin 80 μm and dmaj 200 μm additionally the removal rates of mps by each treatment in surface area were also higher than that in quantity in all wwtps as for swtp samples considering the dimensions of mps that can be removed the smaller particles especially those with dmin 40 μm and dmaj 50 μm increased the difficulty of mp removal retention especially in quantity in agreement with previous studies on the effectiveness of membrane processes for controlling mps padervand et al 2020 talvitie et al 2017 the mbr and uf process in this study both showed considerable retention rates of mps and a significant decrease in mp dimensions and quantity the uf membrane is suggested for terminal water treatment due to the lowest mp concentrations in uf permeate 3 4 microplastics retention in drinking water treatment plants in dwtps the distribution and removal retention of mps in quantity and surface area are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively the distribution of major minor dimensions of mps in different dwtps is shown in fig s4 in terms of mp types in quantity fig 7 pe was the main component in surface water feeding samples for dwtp 2 and dwtp 3 occupying 80 3 and 98 0 2 in inlets respectively pp occupying 76 6 was the main component in underground water feeding dwtp 1 considering the surface area fig 8 the proportion of pe in the inlet of dwtp 3 was only 56 1 while ps was the second most dominant pollutant in the inlet of dwtp 3 occupying 44 2 however ps particles occupied only 0 5 0 1 of mps in quantity meaning that ps particles have much bigger dimensions than pe particles smaller quantities of ps particles were detected in the inlet of dwtp 3 but with a larger surface area figs 7 and 8 the results demonstrated the importance of the three item characterization of mps counts dimensions surface area and types of mps in this study in view of the concentrations the distribution of mps differed greatly in inlets of different dwtps ranging from an average of the lowest concentration of 153 mp l 1 in dwtp 2 to the highest concentration of 19 836 mp l 1 in dwtp 3 focusing on the treatment processes the primary treatment by sieves in dwtp 1 enabled 54 3 and 54 1 removal of mps in quantity and surface area respectively the primary treatment by sedimentation in dwtp 3 provided higher results of 91 4 and 95 2 removal of mps in quantity and surface area respectively treatment by filtration in all dwtps was positioned in the terminal tertiary treatment resulting in qualified permeates with the lowest concentration of mps in each dwtp 18 42 mp l 1 the sand filter in dwtp 3 retained 99 1 of the mps in quantity and 99 1 in surface area additionally the uf membranes both in dwtp 1 and dwtp 2 showed 80 88 retention of mps in quantity and 90 95 retention of mps in surface area finally the mp concentration in filtration permeates from all dwtps was effectively reduced to 18 42 mp l 1 whatever the inlet water conditions in view of mp dimensions fig s4 in si the size distribution of samples in dwtp outlets was quite limited compared to the inlets especially for the uf processes with limited mps dimensions between dmin 80 μm and dmaj 200 μm this underlines the fact that uf membranes were effective for mps retention from dwtps which were acceptable as comparable to the concentration found in ultrapure water yang et al 2022 moreover to be noticed the removal retention rates of mps by each treatment process in surface area were also higher than that of in quantity in dwtps as for wwtps and swtp 4 discussion and conclusion in the light of the above results most of the considered treatment processes were effective on mp removal retention except for some processes with external pollution or the secondary release of mps among all treatment processes uf membranes 0 2 1 μm cartridges and sand filters as the terminal treatment process could enable considerable retention rates for mps to ensure the good quality of outlet water particularly recent uf membrane is highly recommended for mp retention whatever the water types uf membranes could provide higher retention of mps acceptable mp concentrations in permeates and almost complete retention of mps with dmin 80 μm and dmaj 200 μm the retention rates of 200 kda uf in swtp wwtps and dwtps ranged from 72 to 98 in quantity to 81 99 in surface area however considering that most transportation pipes and connections were made of plastics as well as the fact that the dimensions of mps could be as small as nano size it is hard to say that a certain process could remove mps completely even with uf membranes the full mechanisms of mp transfer in the processes still need further study table 3 summarizes the performances of all treatment processes on mps dimension ranges as well as the concentration and proportion of smaller mps dmin 40 μm and dmaj 50 μm in this study the results revealed that mp removal retention effectiveness might ultimately depend on the pore size of the physical treatment processes without chemical reactions statistically the counts of smaller mps with dmin 40 μm and dmaj 50 μm were ranked in dominant positions especially in secondary and tertiary effluents accounting for 11 74 of mps in quantity however the presence of smaller mps increased the difficulty for detection tracking and removal which increased the potential threat for the natural environment and organisms according to batel et al 2020 cellular uptake and transfer of mps across organs seemed only possible for very small microsized or nanosized plastic particles while larger particles pass through the gut system and some organisms are able to handle larger non food particles very well hämer et al 2014 the translocation of smaller mps 0 1 150 μm into the tissue has been demonstrated in multiple studies conducted with rodents rabbits dogs and humans carr et al 2012 imhof and laforsch 2016 larue et al 2021 due to higher surface to volume ratios smaller mps might deliver higher amounts of contaminants such as persistent organic pollutants through transport in gut system and accumulation in food chains batel et al 2020 as a result this study revealed that the identification quantification and removal of smaller mps or even nano sized plastics would be a major challenge for future studies this study evidenced the ubiquitous presence of microplastics in seawater wastewater surface water and underground water in france in comparison wastewater was observed to aggregate the most mps compared to seawater surface water and underground water due to urban agglomeration and anthropogenic impacts table s1 table s2 and table s3 in si summarize the type dimensions and quantitative concentration of mps in wastewater surface water underground water and seawater respectively the 4203 42 000 mp l 1 of mps in raw french wastewater in this study was positioned at the highest level compared to other european countries 2 5 10 044 mp l 1 asian countries 5 8 410 mp l 1 usa and middle east countries through comparison in table s1 in si long et al 2019 sun et al 2019 wu et al 2022 the results of this study in france were closer to mp abundance in some samples from denmark with 2223 10 044 mp l 1 in wwtps simon et al 2018 the removal retention capacity of mps was improved by wwtps with tertiary treatment compared to wwtps with secondary treatment however the mp abundance in secondary and tertiary treated effluents 128 5065 mp l 1 and 35 mp l 1 respectively of this study was a little higher than some other studies 0 828 mp l 1 in terms of surface water and underground water the mp abundance varied a lot with the locations mps in the inlet of dwtp3 in france 19 836 mp l 1 ranked the highest compared to other countries or regions based on table s2 in si followed by mp abundance in the freshwater of china ranging between 13 23 6614 mp l 1 the mp abundances in dwtp 1 2 153 632 mp l 1 were ranked at the upper middle level which was comparable to a study on amsterdam canals with 48 187 mp l 1 leslie et al 2017 in terms of seawater mps abundance in the analyzed samples of this study in france was positioned at the second highest while some samples from korea were found to rank at the highest 448 2000 mp l 1 based on table s3 in si compared to wastewater and freshwater mp abundance in seawater was the lowest among all samples of the present study all 2000 mp l 1 through comparison mps abundance in wastewater surface water groundwater and seawater samples of this study were all positioned at higher levels compared to other countries or regions which may be due to 1 the real mp content in water bodies 2 the higher resolution of μ ftir and 3 rigorous experimental process and collection of smaller mps with dmin 40 μm and dmaj 50 μm additionally the four wwtps three dwtps and swtp in france separately provided 97 3 100 91 9 99 9 92 2 98 1 removal retention of mps in surface area and 87 8 99 8 82 3 99 9 69 0 96 0 removal retention of mps in quantity which showed the comparative effectiveness of water treatment plants worldwide wu et al 2022 moreover the types of mps in the water bodies of france analyzed in this study are basically the same as in other studies mainly composed of pe pp ps and pa long et al 2019 mintenig et al 2020 wang et al 2020 to summarize quantitative concentration of mps in different french water bodies in this study were all assessed at high levels partially because of the higher resolution of the detection method indeed one should keep in mind that the results found in the literature may unfortunately still be very method dependent collection detection analytical method but this still underlines the fact that researchers and the public should pay more attention to mp management and treatment in conclusion this study used a quantitative and qualitative analytical methodology of mps using ftir spectroscopy with the simple analytical software which was confirmed to be an efficient reliable and non destructive detection method for the first time with the same analytical method mps were analyzed in different water types from france and different treatment processes were assessed for mp removal in a single paper the mp concentrations in different types of water resources varied greatly generally raw wastewater contained the highest quantity of mps followed by some surface waters and underground water pe was the most abundant type of mps in almost all water types then followed by pp ps and pet most treatment technologies including primary secondary and tertiary treatment could have the ability to remove retain mps from feed water it should be underlined that the effective disposal of mps after efficient treatment processes including ultrafiltration is necessary some treatment processes transport pipes or other external instruments could also cause a secondary mp contamination of water moreover for almost all treatment processes the removal retention rates of mps in surface area were higher than those of mps in quantity the most probable reasons for this are that 1 the feed water contained larger pieces of mps which were preferably removed retained by different processes 2 the attachment of smaller mps onto larger mps was separated under the forces of water flow and interception 3 aged mps in natural waters were prone to undergo physical abrasion biofouling and chemical oxidation associated weathering by different treatments and further decomposed into smaller secondary mps wu et al 2022 it is believed that this study could finally improve public awareness of mp contamination contribute to mp limitation policies and select appropriate removal technology in the future declaration of competing interest the

15053,the distribution and fate of microplastics in different water sources and their treatment plants seawater three municipal wastewaters a pharmaceutical factory wastewater and three drinking waters in france were studied currently research in this field is still under exploration since almost no relevant standards or policies have been introduced for the detection the removal or the discharge of microplastics this study used an improved quantitative and qualitative analytical methodology for microplastic detection by μ ftir carried out with simple analytical software by investigation wastewater was determined to contain the most abundant microplastics in quantity 4 203 42 000 mp l 1 then followed by surface water groundwater 153 19 836 mp l 1 and seawater around 420 mp l 1 polyethylene was the dominant material in almost all water types followed by polypropylene polystyrene and polyethylene terephthalate almost all treatment technologies could remove microplastics whatever the feed water types and concentration of microplastics though some treatment processes or transport pipes could cause additional contamination from microplastics the four wwtps three dwtps and swtp in france provided respectively 87 8 99 8 82 3 99 9 69 0 96 0 removal retention of mps in quantity and provided 97 3 100 91 9 99 9 92 2 98 1 removal retention of mps in surface

development and progress of society while bringing about potentially emerging contamination risks such as microplastics 0 1 μm 5 mm drummond et al 2022 public concern about microplastic transport and transfer ecological risks and chronic toxicity to living organisms have increased globally excessive production of plastics has risen over 20 fold over the last half century and is predicted to worsen up to at least by 2050 kahane rapport et al 2022 the widespread applications and improper disposal have contributed to the ubiquitous existence of plastic debris in diverse aquatic systems such as wastewater marine water freshwater etc luo et al 2019 specifically 95 99 of mps derived from discarded plastics could be found in raw wastewater and wastewater treatment plants wwtps which were the major receptors for microplastics derived from industries landfill domestic wastewater and stormwater wu et al 2022 the distribution and abundance of microplastic particles mps in wwtps are closely related to human activities and urban agglomeration chen et al 2020 abundance of mps in marine waters was demonstrated to range from tens to thousands of particles per cubic meter and most marine organisms are contaminated with up to hundreds of mps per individual bakir et al 2020 even in freshwater mps of polypropylene pp polyethylene pe polystyrene ps and polyethylene terephthalate pet have been frequently detected accounting for 70 of total mps li et al 2020 additionally the rivers lakes and even glaciers are all contaminated with microplastics for instance mps in lake geneva europe have surprisingly reached a concentration of 48 146 mp km 2 faure et al 2012 and the annual deposition flux of mps in demula glacier asia has been evaluated to 7640 720 to 9550 900 mps m 2 wang et al 2022 in view of environmental risks there is increased toxicity via compound contaminations due to the presence of microplastics and this poses a multitude of threats to humans and other living organisms microplastics most with hydrophobic surfaces probably act as carriers for toxic organic inorganic adsorption and microorganism growth yang et al 2022 more studies have illustrated that humans might be exposed to mps through inhalation ingestion and dermal contact and mps could be transported via blood huang et al 2022 na et al 2021 based on extensive investigations the quantity and spread of microplastic contaminations need to be further researched in order to find solutions to this pollution therefore it is necessary to explore the fate of mps in water treatment plants and investigate the removal efficiency of different treatment technologies on mps additionally the distribution of mps in concentration mp types and mp dimensions varied a lot even in the same water types bretas alvim et al 2020 simon et al 2018 different studies showed poor comparability because of the different detection methods and operation processes previous studies were mainly focused on individual stages in the assessment of mps while an analysis of all stages i e sample extraction processing identification quantification and transportation was required for a comprehensive understanding of the contamination caused by mps therefore an efficient and accurate detection methods for mps are necessary to investigate their distribution and transportation tin france the occurrence of mps in natural aqueous environments has hardly been mentioned and the removal of mps through treatment plants remains to be explored therefore this study was designed to investigate the distribution of mps in france with two main objectives 1 to obtain and compare the essential information on the distribution and abundance of mps from wastewater seawater surface water and underground water 2 to find out the footprint of mps in different water treatment plants and to calculate the related removal efficiency by each treatment process more precisely a reliable analytical method for mp identification and quantification by μ ftir with simple software developed in a previous work yang et al 2023 was adopted in this paper a three item characterization of mps counts dimensions and surface area types is possible with this method samples from wastewater treatment plants wwtps seawater treatment plants swtps and drinking water treatment plants dwtps were all investigated with the same analytical method to evaluate mp removal by primary secondary or tertiary treatment processes moreover the treatment by ultrafiltration uf membranes was particularly assessed this study gives information on microplastics contamination in france with a unified analytical method and in different water samples 2 material and methods 2 1 sample sources three types of water table 1 were analyzed in this study i samples from a swtp with the aim to treat seawater from shellfish farms and before discharge into the ocean by two main treatment routes as shown in fig 1 particularly in treatment route 2 two groups of 200 kda uf modules were located in different positions a semi industrial scale uf with more than 4 years of operation membrane area 9 m2 old uf and an industrial scale uf with less than 1 month operation membrane area 240 m2 new uf ii samples from four different wwtps sites and iii samples from three drinking water treatment plants dwtps to avoid external pollution all samples were collected and transported in 1 l pre cleaned glass bottles with 3 replicates and frozen at 20 c before analysis the bottles were closed immediately after sampling contact with the bottleneck and inner covers was prevented during sampling 2 2 analytical method the detection of mps developed in a previous work yang et al 2023 was achieved with a μ ftir imaging system with a spectrum spotlight 400 μ ftir microscope perkinelmer usa and coupled with simple freeware developed by aalborg university denmark and alfred wegener institute germany the turbidity of samples was tested in the laboratory with a turbidity meter turb 550 ir wtw germany a toc l instrument shimadzu japan based on the 680 c catalytic oxidation method was used to measure the concentration of total organic carbon toc the retention efficiency by membranes or removal efficiency by other treatments was determined as the decreased mps concentration compared to mps concentration in influent of the related treatment process shown in eq 1 1 e retention removal 1 c mps feed c mps effluent 100 where cmps feed represented mp concentration before treatment cmps effluent represents the mp concentration after treatment this equation was applied for mp concentration both in quantity and surface area 2 3 sample pretreatment the pretreatment of the samples was mainly described in table 2 the chemicals h2o2 30 w v fisher chemical koh 10 w v fisher chemical h2so4 1 10 fisher scientific and fenton reagent 0 05 m ii feso4 7h2 o with 30 h2o2 at a volume ratio of 1 1 were used for digestion at room temperature water quality toc concentration turbidity could give some guidelines for digestion requirement the digestion methods duration and dosing concentration was mainly based on the composition of samples of the waters in terms of organic matters and suspended solids ultrapure water and filtrated ethanol through 0 22 μm pes membranes were used for rinsing and cleaning and their contents in mps were assessed as well as airborne contamination plastic made devices or containers were avoided and glass devices or containers were pre cleaned with a selected rinsing solution whose positive control was carried out before use three types of filters 25 μm stain steal filters and 3 or 5 μm gold coated filters i3 trackpor p germany were used for mp collection before μ ftir imaging with a vacuum büchner funnel apparatus mp collection through filtration was operated in a cleaned fume hood with cotton lab coats worn at all times more detailed information on sampling digestion rinsing process and operational conditions can be found in the table 2 yang et al 2023 2 4 lab scale filtration of pe mps by uf membranes uf membranes were multichannel hollow fibers made of polyether sulfone pes alteon i suez aquasource france the molecular weight cut off mwco of the uf membrane was 200 kda with a pore size of 20 nm a uf module was built with one fiber which was composed of 7 channels with an inner diameter of 0 9 mm and installed into a ptfe external shell plugged with epoxy glue on both sides of the module allowing in out dead end filtration the module was 20 cm in length with a surface area of 3 96 10 3 m2 and a concentrate volume of 0 89 ml approximately polyethylene pe microspheres 10 150 μm cospheric usa were used to prepare 0 1 mg l 1 pe suspension as uf feed the dead end filtration test once for 1 l was operated inside out at a constant transmembrane pressure tmp of 0 3 bar the uf system pipes connections or containers contained no pe plastics before filtration uf membranes were rinsed with 1 l of ultrapure water 300 l m 2 under a tmp of 1 0 0 1 bar to remove the preservative agent glycerol each experiment was carried out on a new uf module the uf permeate was collected in pre cleaned glass bottles and immediately analyzed 3 results 3 1 microplastic retention by uf membrane at lab scale the investigation of uf membrane on pe mps retention at lab scale was operated as shown in fig 2 by identification pe was the main type of mp in 0 1mg l 1 pe synthetic suspensions shown in fig s1 in si the uf feed was confirmed by μ ftir to contain the most pe 90 together with a small amount of pp ps and pet in addition a few particles of pp and ps 5 mp l 1 totally also occurred in uf permeate it should be noted that the only mps considered in this part were pe mps for calculations to avoid the influences of airborne contamination and other secondary contamination on final results the 200 kda uf membrane achieved a 91 2 retention of mps in quantity resulting in only 18 mp l 1 in uf permeate the retention rate of mps in surface area reached more than 98 after all the lab scale study confirmed that uf membrane could effectively retain mps from inlet water and control the dimension distribution of pe mps in smaller ranges minor dimensions dmin 50 μm and major dimensions dmaj 150 μm additionally considering the multitude of mp types pe pp ps in uf feed and permeate the question was to know where these particles come from knowing that membrane integrity was checked airborne contamination uf plastic module and permeate pipe degradation more porous module cross section etc uf efficiency for mp removal at full scale will also be assessed in the following sections 3 2 microplastics retention in seawater treatment plant the publications on the presence of mps and their related hazards in marine environments have emerged exponentially but there was a lack of knowledge on the removal of mps in swtps a swtp with two treatment routes was sampled for this study fig 3 shows the distribution of mps in quantity and types together with the removal retention efficiency of mps at different stages of the treatment the top bottom order of water types marked on the y axis was consistent with the discharge sequence in swtp and the samples were named with the related treatment process notably the rules for making figures were kept for all samples taken from different water treatment plants in this study in addition the evolution of mps in surface area and in major and minor dimensions of samples are shown in figs 4 and s1 respectively in treatment route 1 and in view of quantity fig 3 the entire treatment process from seawater to 0 2 μm filter outlet provided 94 2 total removal rate of mps the zeo a uv zeolite a and uv process removed 63 4 of mps from seawater followed by 83 4 of removal by 1 μm cartridge while a 0 2 μm cartridge showed almost no removal of mps in quantity from a 1 μm outlet concerning surface area fig 4 the zeo a uv process showed negative removal i e increased mp surface area in zeo a uv outlet while a 1 μm cartridge and a 0 2 μm cartridge contributed to 97 8 and 44 28 removal of mps respectively under the same treatment process the different removal capacities of mps in quantity and surface area reflected the limits of expressing the results in mp l 1 alone for mps description giving the surface area and dimensions of mps is necessary for a more accurate description in treatment route 2 although zeo b uv outlet old uf feed and new uf feed provided increased mps concentration in quantity compared to seawater fig 3 they resulted in 42 5 60 11 0 removal of mps in surface area fig 4 respectively the zeo b uv outlet the old uf feed and the new uf feed concerned all samples treated by primary sedimentation 100 μm disk zeolite b process and zeo b uv outlet however the increased mps in quantity reflected external mps contaminations mainly by pa pe pp and ps in the paths from the effluent after the zeolite b uv process applied to the three sampling sites passed through different or transportation channels after partial removal of mps by treatment processes that is probably why they exhibited different microplastic concentrations both in quantity and in surface area nevertheless the following uf membranes especially the new uf exhibited excellent retention ability on mps both in quantity and surface area whatever the type of mps in the uf feeds the old uf and new uf respectively resulted in 74 1 and 96 2 retention of mps in quantity and 81 9 and 99 5 0 5 retention of mps in surface area around 130 mp l 1 was detected in old uf permeate and less than 21 mp l 1 were obtained in new uf permeate therefore the results indicated that uf membranes provided effective retention of mps from influent especially with recent uf membranes in general swtp treatment by 1 μm cartridge 0 2 μm cartridge and uf membranes all provided comparatively considerable removal or retention efficiency of mps while treatments with zeolite a uv and zeolite b uv posed potential contaminations of mps when treated with zeolite a uv fig 4 96 4 of pe particles in surface area occurred in the zeo a uv outlet while only 2 4 of pe occurred in seawater raw influent moreover the zeo a uv outlet was found with more and larger mps dmin 150 μm and dmaj 400 μm compared to that in seawater si fig s2 a b when treated with zeolite b uv an increase in the quantity of pa pe and pp particles in quantity was discovered in the zeo b uv outlet compared to seawater fig 3 since zeolites are the aluminosilicate members of microporous solids mainly consisting of silicon aluminum and oxygen jiang et al 2018 micro pollution such as mps could be blocked in the zeolite in long term use and without cleaning which could lead to secondary pollution of mps in the effluents this result emphasizes the need to pay more attention to the secondary contamination of microplastics which might come from the treatment processes in view of uf membranes both old and new uf showed good retention rates on mps in quantity and in surface area according to si fig s2 smaller mps between dmin 40 μm and dmaj 50 μm were discovered to be dominant in old uf permeate occupying 65 of total mps si fig s2 g meanwhile mps with dmin 80 μm and dmaj 200 μm were almost completely retained by both old uf and new uf membranes since the two uf modules were both 200 kda hollow fiber membranes made of pes the main difference was the duration of use it could be inferred that uf membranes themselves were not the polluting sources of mps according to the mp types in permeates while membrane aging could decrease the mps retention capacity especially on smaller particles dmin 40 μm and dmaj 50 μm additionally comparing the removal retention rates of mps in quantity fig 3 and surface area fig 4 by different treatment processes e g 1 μm cartridge 0 2 μm cartridge and uf membranes without ignorable external contaminations higher removal rates in total surface area were found compared to those in quantity this study is one of the first to report this finding but more verification is required in the following investigations together with further discussion for explanations 3 3 microplastics retention in wastewater treatment plants four different wwtps in france were sampled for mp analysis three of the wwtps wwtp 1 3 were built with secondary treatments and wwtp 4 was upgraded with uf as a tertiary treatment the distribution and removal retention of mps in quantity and surface area are shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively the distribution of major minor dimensions of mps in different wwtps is shown in fig s3 in terms of mp types pe was the main type of mps in municipal wwtps wwtp 2 4 and pa was predominant in the pharmaceutical wwtp 1 figs 5 and 6 in terms of concentration in quantity fig 5 the influent of pharmaceutical wwtp 1 contained around 4203 mp l 1 of mps while those of municipal wwtps were more loaded with mps ranging from 15 000 mp l 1 to 42 000 mp l 1 in municipal wwtps the removal rates of mps by activated sludge physico chemical biofiltration and mbr all achieved more than 88 removal fig 5 together with more than 97 removal of mps in surface area fig 6 focusing on membrane processes both mbrs in wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 showed good retention rates 88 95 in quantity and 97 98 in surface area for mps as mbr permeates in wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 respectively contained 190 mp l 1 and 5065 mp l 1 the mbr in wwtp 1 pore size of 0 02 μm was more effective for mp removal mbr in wwtp 2 showed weaker retention of mps than in wwtp 1 which might be caused by the bigger pore size of the membrane in wwtp 2 0 1 μm but also by 10 fold higher mp concentration both in quantity and surface area in influent of wwtp 2 although the retention rate of 200 kda uf in wwtp 4 72 in quantity and 72 in surface area was lower than secondary treatments in all wwtps 88 uf membranes provided the lowest mps concentration both in quantity 35 mp l 1 and surface area the relatively lower retention rates by uf were mainly due to the reduced mps concentrations in uf feed finally even if the concentration of mps varied greatly in raw wastewater all secondary treatments provided considerable removal efficiency on mps both in quantity and surface area however although the mps removal by secondary treatment was quite effective the residual mps in secondary effluents ranging from 128 mp l 1 to 5065 mp l 1 still needed more treatment thereby the uf membrane would be recommended as an effective treatment for mps after secondary treatment to better control the mp concentrations quantity and surface area at lower levels in view of dimensions fig s3 the dimensions of mps in mbr effluent and uf permeate were smaller than that in activated sludge or biofiltration process effluent particularly 200 kda uf in wwtp 4 controlled mps within a much smaller range dmin 80 μm and dmaj 200 μm additionally the removal rates of mps by each treatment in surface area were also higher than that in quantity in all wwtps as for swtp samples considering the dimensions of mps that can be removed the smaller particles especially those with dmin 40 μm and dmaj 50 μm increased the difficulty of mp removal retention especially in quantity in agreement with previous studies on the effectiveness of membrane processes for controlling mps padervand et al 2020 talvitie et al 2017 the mbr and uf process in this study both showed considerable retention rates of mps and a significant decrease in mp dimensions and quantity the uf membrane is suggested for terminal water treatment due to the lowest mp concentrations in uf permeate 3 4 microplastics retention in drinking water treatment plants in dwtps the distribution and removal retention of mps in quantity and surface area are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively the distribution of major minor dimensions of mps in different dwtps is shown in fig s4 in terms of mp types in quantity fig 7 pe was the main component in surface water feeding samples for dwtp 2 and dwtp 3 occupying 80 3 and 98 0 2 in inlets respectively pp occupying 76 6 was the main component in underground water feeding dwtp 1 considering the surface area fig 8 the proportion of pe in the inlet of dwtp 3 was only 56 1 while ps was the second most dominant pollutant in the inlet of dwtp 3 occupying 44 2 however ps particles occupied only 0 5 0 1 of mps in quantity meaning that ps particles have much bigger dimensions than pe particles smaller quantities of ps particles were detected in the inlet of dwtp 3 but with a larger surface area figs 7 and 8 the results demonstrated the importance of the three item characterization of mps counts dimensions surface area and types of mps in this study in view of the concentrations the distribution of mps differed greatly in inlets of different dwtps ranging from an average of the lowest concentration of 153 mp l 1 in dwtp 2 to the highest concentration of 19 836 mp l 1 in dwtp 3 focusing on the treatment processes the primary treatment by sieves in dwtp 1 enabled 54 3 and 54 1 removal of mps in quantity and surface area respectively the primary treatment by sedimentation in dwtp 3 provided higher results of 91 4 and 95 2 removal of mps in quantity and surface area respectively treatment by filtration in all dwtps was positioned in the terminal tertiary treatment resulting in qualified permeates with the lowest concentration of mps in each dwtp 18 42 mp l 1 the sand filter in dwtp 3 retained 99 1 of the mps in quantity and 99 1 in surface area additionally the uf membranes both in dwtp 1 and dwtp 2 showed 80 88 retention of mps in quantity and 90 95 retention of mps in surface area finally the mp concentration in filtration permeates from all dwtps was effectively reduced to 18 42 mp l 1 whatever the inlet water conditions in view of mp dimensions fig s4 in si the size distribution of samples in dwtp outlets was quite limited compared to the inlets especially for the uf processes with limited mps dimensions between dmin 80 μm and dmaj 200 μm this underlines the fact that uf membranes were effective for mps retention from dwtps which were acceptable as comparable to the concentration found in ultrapure water yang et al 2022 moreover to be noticed the removal retention rates of mps by each treatment process in surface area were also higher than that of in quantity in dwtps as for wwtps and swtp 4 discussion and conclusion in the light of the above results most of the considered treatment processes were effective on mp removal retention except for some processes with external pollution or the secondary release of mps among all treatment processes uf membranes 0 2 1 μm cartridges and sand filters as the terminal treatment process could enable considerable retention rates for mps to ensure the good quality of outlet water particularly recent uf membrane is highly recommended for mp retention whatever the water types uf membranes could provide higher retention of mps acceptable mp concentrations in permeates and almost complete retention of mps with dmin 80 μm and dmaj 200 μm the retention rates of 200 kda uf in swtp wwtps and dwtps ranged from 72 to 98 in quantity to 81 99 in surface area however considering that most transportation pipes and connections were made of plastics as well as the fact that the dimensions of mps could be as small as nano size it is hard to say that a certain process could remove mps completely even with uf membranes the full mechanisms of mp transfer in the processes still need further study table 3 summarizes the performances of all treatment processes on mps dimension ranges as well as the concentration and proportion of smaller mps dmin 40 μm and dmaj 50 μm in this study the results revealed that mp removal retention effectiveness might ultimately depend on the pore size of the physical treatment processes without chemical reactions statistically the counts of smaller mps with dmin 40 μm and dmaj 50 μm were ranked in dominant positions especially in secondary and tertiary effluents accounting for 11 74 of mps in quantity however the presence of smaller mps increased the difficulty for detection tracking and removal which increased the potential threat for the natural environment and organisms according to batel et al 2020 cellular uptake and transfer of mps across organs seemed only possible for very small microsized or nanosized plastic particles while larger particles pass through the gut system and some organisms are able to handle larger non food particles very well hämer et al 2014 the translocation of smaller mps 0 1 150 μm into the tissue has been demonstrated in multiple studies conducted with rodents rabbits dogs and humans carr et al 2012 imhof and laforsch 2016 larue et al 2021 due to higher surface to volume ratios smaller mps might deliver higher amounts of contaminants such as persistent organic pollutants through transport in gut system and accumulation in food chains batel et al 2020 as a result this study revealed that the identification quantification and removal of smaller mps or even nano sized plastics would be a major challenge for future studies this study evidenced the ubiquitous presence of microplastics in seawater wastewater surface water and underground water in france in comparison wastewater was observed to aggregate the most mps compared to seawater surface water and underground water due to urban agglomeration and anthropogenic impacts table s1 table s2 and table s3 in si summarize the type dimensions and quantitative concentration of mps in wastewater surface water underground water and seawater respectively the 4203 42 000 mp l 1 of mps in raw french wastewater in this study was positioned at the highest level compared to other european countries 2 5 10 044 mp l 1 asian countries 5 8 410 mp l 1 usa and middle east countries through comparison in table s1 in si long et al 2019 sun et al 2019 wu et al 2022 the results of this study in france were closer to mp abundance in some samples from denmark with 2223 10 044 mp l 1 in wwtps simon et al 2018 the removal retention capacity of mps was improved by wwtps with tertiary treatment compared to wwtps with secondary treatment however the mp abundance in secondary and tertiary treated effluents 128 5065 mp l 1 and 35 mp l 1 respectively of this study was a little higher than some other studies 0 828 mp l 1 in terms of surface water and underground water the mp abundance varied a lot with the locations mps in the inlet of dwtp3 in france 19 836 mp l 1 ranked the highest compared to other countries or regions based on table s2 in si followed by mp abundance in the freshwater of china ranging between 13 23 6614 mp l 1 the mp abundances in dwtp 1 2 153 632 mp l 1 were ranked at the upper middle level which was comparable to a study on amsterdam canals with 48 187 mp l 1 leslie et al 2017 in terms of seawater mps abundance in the analyzed samples of this study in france was positioned at the second highest while some samples from korea were found to rank at the highest 448 2000 mp l 1 based on table s3 in si compared to wastewater and freshwater mp abundance in seawater was the lowest among all samples of the present study all 2000 mp l 1 through comparison mps abundance in wastewater surface water groundwater and seawater samples of this study were all positioned at higher levels compared to other countries or regions which may be due to 1 the real mp content in water bodies 2 the higher resolution of μ ftir and 3 rigorous experimental process and collection of smaller mps with dmin 40 μm and dmaj 50 μm additionally the four wwtps three dwtps and swtp in france separately provided 97 3 100 91 9 99 9 92 2 98 1 removal retention of mps in surface area and 87 8 99 8 82 3 99 9 69 0 96 0 removal retention of mps in quantity which showed the comparative effectiveness of water treatment plants worldwide wu et al 2022 moreover the types of mps in the water bodies of france analyzed in this study are basically the same as in other studies mainly composed of pe pp ps and pa long et al 2019 mintenig et al 2020 wang et al 2020 to summarize quantitative concentration of mps in different french water bodies in this study were all assessed at high levels partially because of the higher resolution of the detection method indeed one should keep in mind that the results found in the literature may unfortunately still be very method dependent collection detection analytical method but this still underlines the fact that researchers and the public should pay more attention to mp management and treatment in conclusion this study used a quantitative and qualitative analytical methodology of mps using ftir spectroscopy with the simple analytical software which was confirmed to be an efficient reliable and non destructive detection method for the first time with the same analytical method mps were analyzed in different water types from france and different treatment processes were assessed for mp removal in a single paper the mp concentrations in different types of water resources varied greatly generally raw wastewater contained the highest quantity of mps followed by some surface waters and underground water pe was the most abundant type of mps in almost all water types then followed by pp ps and pet most treatment technologies including primary secondary and tertiary treatment could have the ability to remove retain mps from feed water it should be underlined that the effective disposal of mps after efficient treatment processes including ultrafiltration is necessary some treatment processes transport pipes or other external instruments could also cause a secondary mp contamination of water moreover for almost all treatment processes the removal retention rates of mps in surface area were higher than those of mps in quantity the most probable reasons for this are that 1 the feed water contained larger pieces of mps which were preferably removed retained by different processes 2 the attachment of smaller mps onto larger mps was separated under the forces of water flow and interception 3 aged mps in natural waters were prone to undergo physical abrasion biofouling and chemical oxidation associated weathering by different treatments and further decomposed into smaller secondary mps wu et al 2022 it is believed that this study could finally improve public awareness of mp contamination contribute to mp limitation policies and select appropriate removal technology in the future declaration of competing interest the

15054,microplastics of millimeter dimensions have been widely investigated in environmental compartments and today studies are mainly focused on particles of smaller dimensions 500 µm however as there are no relevant standards or policies for the preparation and analysis of complex water samples containing such particles the results may be questionable therefore a methodological approach for 10 µm to 500 µm microplastic analysis was developed using μ ftir spectroscopy coupled with the simple analytical software this was undertaken on different water samples sea fresh and wastewater taking into consideration rinsing water digestion protocols collection of microplastics and sample characteristics ultrapure water was the optimal rinsing water and ethanol was also proposed with a mandatory previous filtration although water quality could give some guidelines for the selection of digestion protocols it is not the only decisive factor the methodology approach by μ ftir spectroscopy was finally assessed to be effective and reliable this improved quantitative and qualitative analytical methodology for microplastic detection can then be used to assess the removal efficiency of

retention recovery and analytical methods has been increasingly developed for the last 10 years microplastic particles mps 0 1 μm 5 mm originate either from primary manufactured or secondary degraded plastic objects frias and nash 2019 annually in europe polymer production increased greatly from 0 35 million tons in the 1950s to 55 million tons in 2020 while 63 000 to 430 000 tons of microplastics enter farmland through compost sludges application nizzetto et al 2016 and around 2461 8627 tons of microplastics enter marine environments annually jambeck et al 2015 lebreton et al 2017 sherrington et al 2016 massive amounts of mps have caused increasingly adverse effects on humans and the environment 1 mps can be swallowed by organisms and transported through food chains rillig 2012 for instance ragusa et al 2021 discovered the presence of mps 5 10 μm in human placentas and sussarellu et al 2016 found polystyrene particles ps 2 6 µm translocated in blood circulation leading to reproductive disruption for marine filter feeders 2 some mps could release toxic compounds such as dioxins phthalates vinyl chloride etc certain additives such as plasticizers stabilizers and pigments added by manufacturers to plastics are mostly hazardous substances nobre et al 2015 3 mps could induce chronic toxicity which was considered as a key issue for long term exposure campanale et al 2020 prata et al 2019a 4 mps could act as vectors for toxic organic substances and microorganisms nobre et al 2015 yang et al 2022 moreover old microplastics could be further degraded into smaller microparticles or even nanoparticles jambeck et al 2015 however public perception of the risks induced by microplastics is low and few countries or regions have issued relevant detection method standards and production limitation policies among present analytical methods micro fourier transform infrared μ ftir spectroscopy is an advanced analytical approach for testing mps it is a non destructive analytical technique which can produce infrared absorption spectra for both thick and opaque materials shim et al 2017 generally sample pretreatment is necessary to avoid the shelter of microplastics by organic and inorganic materials and to allow their precise identification after digestion the common digestion protocols include oxidation alkaline or acidic treatment and enzymatic degradation stock et al 2019 sun et al 2019 h2o2 and fenton reagent are the most used chemicals for oxidative digestion which have no or very few effects on microplastic properties hurley et al 2018 tagg et al 2015a according to prata et al 2019a 95 of 20 sediment studies used h2o2 and or fenton reagent for digestion and higher than 60 of 20 studies of water samples mainly seawater and freshwater used h2o2 for digestion a similar conclusion was also inferred from the survey in table s1 in supplementary information si in comparison fenton reagent is effective in accelerating digestion rates when compared to h2o2 hurley et al 2018 alkaline digestion with 10 koh solution is highly recommended for sea animals or seawater digestion since it can break down soft tissue and bivalve tissues in marine samples thiele et al 2019 koh is also useful for the digestion of natural organic matter feathers fat etc enzymatic digestion is a rapid reaction for complete degradation of organics while it is considered as an expensive complex and sometimes destructive method on mp extraction prata et al 2019b density separation with nacl nai and zncl2 could be coupled with other digestion processes to isolate mps li et al 2018a but showed lower recovery on smaller and denser mps radford et al 2021 currently the digestion protocols for microplastic recovery are mostly based on experiments from the literature the preparation methods are not yet standardized in view of the rinsing process most studies used ultrapure water 63 in 27 studies with or without ethanol and 44 without ethanol and secondly used distilled water for investigation shown in table s2 in si since particles from rinsing could easily stick to surfaces and remain thus leading to contamination of the sample certain criteria need to be met for rinsing 1 evaluation of the existence of mps in potential rinsing water solution and potentially filtrating it before use 2 determination of the reliable rinsing water solution with minimum mps prior to experiments however fewer studies completed the above steps thus it is necessary to investigate the presence of mps in the rinsing water solution to avoid external interference additionally considering the expression of mps concentration fewer researchers filtered 1 l of samples for analysis while others particularly for organic rich samples maybe filtered only several milliliters simon et al 2018 most of them calculated mp concentration by assuming the proportional relationship between the filtered volume and the mp counts but without accurately determining it therefore actual drawbacks of mp analysis sometimes include the incomplete recovery of mps from different samples the selection of appropriate digestion method vs nature of samples the limitation on quantification and identification of mps and the global accuracy of analytical results therefore this study aims to develop a method for the identification type and size and quantification of mps in different water samples efforts have been made for the improvement of detection accuracy selection of purified rinsing water suitable sampling and digestion methods depending on the water type rigorous detection process and high precision analytical methods to obtain the counts dimensions and type of microplastics by μ ftir in reflectance mode 2 material and methods 2 1 sample sources three types of water were analyzed and their location was shown in fig 1 i samples from a seawater treatment plant swtp which aims to treat seawater from shellfish farms to produce purified seawater ii samples from four different wastewater treatment plants wwtp and iii samples from three drinking water treatment plants dwtp the detailed information of each site is shown in table 1 to avoid external pollution all samples were collected and transported via 1 l glass bottles and frozen until analysis 2 2 sample pretreatment the commonly used rinsing water solutions tested in this study included evian water ultrapure water up water labostar twf7 siemens distilled water di tap water hplc water 34877 2 5l m sigma aldrich and ethanol both in polyethylene pe and glass bottles ethanol absolute vwr usa three digestion methods were investigated in this study firstly samples can be digested with h2o2 30 w v fisher chemical at volume ratio vsample vh2o2 from 1 1 to 1 2 for 1 14 days secondly and for stronger oxidation samples can be digested with fenton reagent 0 05 m feso4 7h2 o with 30 h2o2 at volume ratio of 1 1 feso4 7h2o solution was made by dissolving 2 5 g of feso4 7h2o analytical reagent grade fisher scientific in 165 ml up water and ultrapure water labostar twf7 siemens acidified and with 1 ml of concentrated h2so4 95 fisher scientific thirdly some more recalcitrant samples need digestion with 10 w v koh purity 85 fischer chemicals for 24 72 h and h2so4 can be finally added to adjust ph and eliminate alkaline precipitation all operations were conducted in cleaned glass devices and covered with aluminum foil to prevent airborne contamination all digestion processes were operated at room temperature 25 c the handling of samples was carried out under controlled air conditions in a cleaned fume hood and operators wore cotton laboratory coats throughout the experiment turbidity of water samples was measured using wtw turb 550 ir in nephelometric turbidity unit ntu the relative error of this method is 2 total organic carbon toc was measured using a shimadzu tocl lcsh csn toc analyzer detailed information is shown in si section 2 2 3 mp collection before analysis the final step before μ ftir imaging was the filtration of samples three types of filters were used 3 or 5 μm gold coated polyester membranes i3 trackpor p germany and 25 μm stainless steel filters in reflectance mode the gold material and stainless steel slides were both good choices as background as they can reflect infrared radiation with almost no absorption gonzalez torres et al 2017 the samples were then filtered through a vacuum büchner funnel apparatus fisher scientific sweden fig s1 in si the filtration masks were round metal discs with a square hole in the center to regulate the sedimentation area on the filters square holes with sides of 5500 and 10 000 μm were respectively used on gold coated filters and stainless steel filters for samples with visible particles and solids a two stage filtration was performed firstly using the stainless steel filter then using the gold coated filter the result for such a sample corresponds to the sum of mps on each filter for cleaner purified water samples the filtration was achieved directly on a gold filter before and after analysis by μ ftir spectroscopy the filter with the collected sample was stored in a glass petri dish to avoid any external pollution 2 4 μ ftir spectroscopy the detection of microplastics was achieved with the μ ftir imaging system spotlight 400 μ ftir microscope perkinelmer usa the detection system is mainly composed of four parts the μ ftir spectrometer the spectrum spotlight 400 μ ftir microscope the stage control for sample view movement in automatic and manual modes and the computer for data treatment the microscope detector is a highly sensitive liquid nitrogen cooled mercury cadmium telluride detector ln mct for smaller particles 10 μm in this study the spectrometer was set up to reflectance mode with a linear scan array detector this detector assembly enables rapid analysis of thick and opaque samples and is highly suitable for detecting for example microplastics in environmental samples tagg et al 2015b a 16 cm 1 spectral resolution was used as the best compromise between spectral quality and acquisition rapidity zheng et al 2021 background spectrum imaging was collected from the gold filter both at 6 25 μm or 25 μm pixels the other identification parameters of μ ftir are 2 scans per pixel an interferometer velocity of 2 2 cm s 1 an infrared spectral range of 4000 690 cm 1 and an imaging resolution of 6 25 μm or 25 μm depending on the filters for each sample the μ ftir generated an absorbance image 1 5 h duration per filter with infrared spectrum information on each pixel 2 5 simple for rapid identification and quantification of microplastics to identify microplastic structures in this study a freeware simple developed by aalborg university denmark and alfred wegener institute germany https simple plastics eu was adopted the reference database contains most polymers and natural materials such as protein and cellulose a total of 23 material types found in table s3 in si primpke et al 2020a verified the high sensitivity and high accuracy for microplastic identification by simple with greater than 95 correct assignment rates on spectra simple can provide parameters on polymer types range of abscissa and ordinates number of pixels minor major dimensions surface area and estimated volume and mass of each particle nevertheless the volume μm3 l 1 and mass concentrations mg l 1 were not provided for comparison and quantification due to the large error probabilities because evidence was lacking for the assumptive thickness 0 67 times the minor dimension and stereostructure ellipsoid mintenig et al 2020 simon et al 2018 in this study mp concentrations were expressed in quantity mp l 1 and surface area μm2 l 1 to better understand the structure and distribution of particles in real waters 2 6 selection of rinsing water solution this section is designed to investigate the microplastic abundance in the commonly used rinsing water solutions such as evian water ultrapure water up water distilled water tap water hplc water reference 34877 2 5l m sigma aldrich and ethanol both in pe bottles and glass bottles ethanol absolute vwr usa each rinsing solution was analyzed at least three times and the glass devices were first rinsed with ultrapure water then rinsed with 0 5 or 1 l of the tested liquid before filtration 2 7 verification of type and dimensions of polyethylene microspheres and of proportionality between the quantity of mp and water volume synthetic pe microspheres 0 96 g cm 3 10 150 μm from cospheric usa were used as referral mps moreover due to their hydrophobic properties pe particles were oxidized under uv light for 5 days 400 w 60 c in sepap 12 24 atlas to limit their uneven temporal and spatial distribution in up water it was verified that their spectra under atr ftir verification were not modified with uv irradiation the μ ftir images of pe microspheres are shown in fig 2 the dispersed pe particles in red were chosen for size analysis statistical data analysis was performed using microsoft office excel 2016 and spss version 22 spss inc the test for normal distribution used the shapiro wilk test on distribution of particle dimensions and showed that both minor dimensions dmin and major dimensions dmaj of pe fitted with a normal distribution normality test p value 0 05 resulting in 50 dmin 100 μm and 100 dmaj 150 μm respectively the minor dimensions of pe beads are in the range of 50 to 100 μm and their major dimensions are in the range of 100 to 150 μm which agreed with the manufacturer s data in the most recent work the concentrations of microplastics are expressed in mp l 1 and in addition they are expressed in μm2 l 1 surface area of mp covering the filter to better consider the size and shapes of the particles mintenig et al 2020 most of previous studies calculated microplastic concentration as they assume the proportional relationship between the filtered volume and the number of microplastics but without any proof therefore it is of interest to investigate the accuracy and feasibility of this assumption to confirm whether the filtered volume and the mp counts were positively related two experiments were designed to investigate 1 mp concentrations in different volumes 250 500 1000 and 2000 ml of up water and 2 pe mp concentrations in different volumes 250 500 1000 and 2000 ml of synthetic pe suspension 0 1 mg l 1 in this part the 0 1 mg l 1 pe suspension was diluted from a 10 mg l 1 pe stock solution pe stock solution was stirred for at least 1 h before sampling the synthetic pe suspensions were firstly stirred for 1 h and then sonicated for 15 min before filtration to promote the uniform distribution of pe in water each sample was measured in triplicates and all were filtered through the 5 μm gold coated filters the pe mp concentration in synthetic pe suspensions excluded the amount of pe in up water the relative error of mp concentration in different volumes was calculated based on eq 1 1 e 1 c mps c mps ave 100 where cmps mp l 1 represents the quantitative mp concentration in tested samples cmps ave mp l 1 represents the average mp concentration among different volumes of samples a one way analysis of variance anova was conducted for a linear regression test on particle numbers all tests were statistically verified with p values under 0 05 3 results 3 1 identification and quantification of microplastic particles using μ ftir and simple in this study it was first confirmed that the identification of mps on one sample a filter by μ ftir and simple was consistent with the results for 3 replicates using the same procedures furthermore the results were consistent with the detection by atr ftir on known pe mps section 2 7 thus the detection by μ ftir and simple showed a valid identification concerning mps to obtain highly accurate results the differences between two imaging resolutions of μ ftir 6 25 μm and 25 μm were investigated the results and discussion are shown in figs s2 and s3 in si in this study the image on 25 μm filters used 25 μm resolution and the image on 3 or 5 μm filters used 6 25 μm resolution 3 2 filtration apparatus efficiency and rinsing water solution selection table 2 showed the results of abundances types and dimensions of mps and total particles tps in different types of rinsing water under 6 25 μm imaging air quality was tested by filtering air through the gold filter by a vacuum pump at 80 kpa under the fume hood for 30 min forty six tps and only 2 pe mps were detected confirming that air had no effect on results concerning mps found on the filter the filtration of all water samples 1 l through the gold coated filter 5 μm was rapid 30 s and replicated n 3 ethanol either in glass or pe bottles contained hundreds of mps most in pe and is thus not recommended for rinsing directly di water was ranked second highest for mp concentration while hplc water exhibited the lowest concentration the mp concentrations in evian tap water and up water were middle ranged while up water contained the lowest concentration of tps since di and up water were both generated from tap water the increased mp concentration and mp types pet eva might be related to process contamination due to polymer pipes taps or filters and the purified process contributed to tp removal considering these results the following water solutions were not applied for rinsing in this study tap and di water were excluded due to the large amount of tps untreated ethanol due to abundant mps hplc water due to expense and evian water due to the considerable cost and the presence of large particles dmaj 20 200 μm dmin 16 100 μm up water contained acceptable mp concentration the lowest quantity of tps and smaller dimensions of mps ethanol is often recommended due to its merits in both hydrophilicity and lipophilicity it was suggested that ethanol was prefiltered through a 1 μm non plastic membrane to limit the mp abundance before use therefore up water and filtered ethanol filtered by 0 22 μm pes membrane 10 mp l 1 were recommended for rinsing additionally the volume of rinsing water was limited within 50 ml 1 0 0 4 mps which caused an insignificant influence on mp results 3 3 abundance and distribution of mps vs analyzed water volume in up water the statistical test showed a positive correlation between mp concentration and filtered volume p value 0 004 0 05 r2 0 9745 as shown in fig 3 in fig 3 a mp concentration became stable when the filtered volume was higher than 500 ml which was consistent with the results obtained by prata et al 2020 the relative error based on eq 1 decreased with increasing filtered volume resulting in 13 6 500 ml 11 9 1000 ml 3 8 2000 ml in mp enriched suspension fig 4 pe mp concentration resulted in positive correlations p value 0 038 0 05 r2 0 8995 with filtered volumes of 0 1 mg l 1 pe synthetic suspensions moreover pe mp concentration tended to stabilize when the filtered volume was higher than 1000 ml as a result it can be inferred that mp concentrations were positively related to the filtered volumes particularly both up water and pe synthetic suspensions did not contain organic matter therefore organic poor samples with volumes higher than 500 ml were considered as an optimum compromise between the drawbacks and the reliability of the results however in actual conditions samples may contain millions of mps per liter and be rich in organics for which their analysis may be impossible to complete by one time detection according to anger et al 2018 and karlsson et al 2020 mp counts in subsamples fitted with continuous gaussian distribution when samples were heavily contaminated by mps thus subsamples provided higher probability of accuracy more precisely it is necessary to have smaller volume of subsamples 500 ml but more replicates 4 10 times to improve the accuracy and reliability of results accordingly samples in this study were separated into two groups organic poor samples once filtered volume 500 ml and organic rich samples once filtered volume 500 ml in fact 500 1000 ml of organic poor samples were tested once and with 2 3 replicates 0 500 ml organic rich samples were tested once and with 4 10 replicates to increase the reliability of samples table 3 4 digestion protocol in this study transparent samples with no visible suspended particles were not digested and thus directly filtered these include tap water di water ultrapure water evian water hplc water ethanol tertiary treated effluents from dwtps wwtps and swtps such as uf permeate 1 and 0 2 μm outlets otherwise for other samples from dwtps wwtps and swtps a digestion process was necessary the choice of digestion methods in different samples was explored and discussed in the following sections the thoroughness of the digestion was closely related to temperature dose of chemicals and reaction duration in this study the dose of chemicals was added based on the literature experiments and testing in the lab 4 1 digestion of samples from wwtps with h2o2 and fenton in view of the fact that secondary effluents from wwtps usually caused dense fouling on gold coated filters which became unusable for infrared spectroscopy fig 5 a showed the filter image after the filtration of 50 ml secondary effluent from wwtp 4 resulting in severe dark fouling cake after digestion for one day 1d with h2o2 after digestion with h2o2 for 7 10 d the filter became much cleaner with reaction time increases fig 5 b c similar results were obtained on other samples from wwtps thus the digestion process with 30 h2o2 vsample vh2o2 1 2 showed effective oxidation effects on all secondary effluents from wwtps with a reaction time from 3 to 10 days as presented in table 3 as raw wastewater is expected to contain higher concentrations of organic matters and particles compared to treated effluents the digestion by h2o2 vsample vh2o2 2 1 was insufficient to completely oxidize the organic matter the samples were still opaque and turbid after 14 days of oxidation even though the volume ratio of h2o2 to raw wastewater was increased from 1 1 to 2 1 fig 6 a c μ ftir spectral imaging demonstrated that the main components identified in raw wastewater from wwtp 1 were proteins fig 6 c1 fenton reagent could provide stronger digestion effects on organic rich samples in less time and with less impact on microplastic chemistry or size tagg et al 2016 therefore fenton reagent vsample vfenton 4 1 was added into the mixture after 14 days of oxidation with h2o2 at a ph between 2 5 and 3 5 to avoid iron oxide precipitation pilli et al 2015 the image of the sample after another 24 h digestion is shown in fig 6 d the sample became much cleaner and transparent with the complete decomposition of proteins after 24 h of fenton reaction observed in fig 6 d1 d2 therefore it could be inferred that h2o2 was able to digest secondary effluents vsample vh2o2 2 1 with the availability to be able to digest organic matter in samples but neither proteins nor cellulose in this case fenton digestion as a stronger oxidative reagent showed effective decomposition of protein cellulose rich samples such as raw wastewater in a faster more complete process thus it is suggested to sequentially use digestion by h2o2 and fenton for raw wastewater samples the h2o2 was firstly added vsample vh2o2 1 1 to 1 2 to partially oxidize the samples within 3 to 14 days then fenton was added to the mixture vsample vfenton 4 1 to 2 1 to finalize the digestion of the sample within 12 to 36 h 4 2 digestion of seawater from swtp with h2o2 and koh seawater samples seawater zeo a outlet zeo b outlet were first digested by one step h2o2 but resulting in an insignificant improvement on filtration even when digested for more than 10 days fifteen ml net volume of samples could completely foul the gold filters as shown in fig s4 a1 a2 in si since seawater might contain shellfish and plant algae tissues 10 w v koh was added to samples which could break down soft tissue and bivalve tissues thiele et al 2019 however some calcium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide were generated after 10 koh was applied which made the solution white and turbid therefore 10 h2so4 was added drop by drop into the solution to eliminate the insoluble alkaline precipitation after 12 h of koh digestion afterward the visible survey of seawater samples became much clearer for identification and quantification fig s4 b1 b2 in si finally the seawater samples of up to 37 5 ml net sample volume can be filtered through the gold coated filters validating the digestion process of koh and h2so4 acidification on seawater samples 4 3 digestion of surface and underground water with acid and h2o2 the water qualities of surface water and underground water were significantly better than the inlets from wwtps and swtp with transparent and slightly visible particles nevertheless these samples needed digestion due to their components for example underground water from dwtp 1 needed acid 10 h2so4 to dissolve the caco3 which formed a white cake on the gold coated filter and covered mps and had a negative effect on infrared detection as shown in fig s5 a2 in si the components of surface water seemed to be somewhat more complex than underground water as it contained caco3 proteins and cellulose together with some hard to digest but unknown substances fig s5 c1 c2 c3 in si the digestion of surface water from dwtp 3 concerned a combined treatment with alkali 10 koh followed by acid 10 h2so4 which was applied to surface water from dwtp 3 samples from dwtp 2 were clean enough to be filtered through 5 μm filters thus with no digestion requirement 4 4 discussion on digestion improvement the digestion protocols used for the preparation of water samples and the filtered volume obtained on gold filters together with some parameters of the water samples toc concentration and turbidity are shown in table 3 notably samples without any digestion requirement were excluded such as in the uf permeates and dwtp2 samples the quality of samples without digestion was good enough to be filtered directly all with turbidity 1 0 ntu toc 6 0 mgc l 1 transparent and with non visible suspended particles samples with digestion requirements were discussed as follows in wwtps the decreased toc concentration and turbidity in secondary effluents showed mild digesting with 5 6 d h2o2 while raw wastewaters required 7 14 days of digestion with h2o2 and 12 24 h fenton reaction in swtp samples containing lower toc concentration 2 0 3 0 mgc l 1 but significant turbidity 1 3 6 3 ntu the coupling of h2o2 and koh was sufficient for digestion without further oxidation by fenton probably due to the dissolved undissolved solids salts minerals and tissues al dahaan et al 2016 samples from dwtps had the best qualities with the lowest toc concentration 0 5 1 3 mgc l 1 and turbidity 0 34 1 2 ntu dwtp 2 samples demanded no digestion while dwtp 1 samples needed slight oxidation by h2o2 and dwtp 3 samples needed further acidification mainly due to the existence of proteins cellulose and caco3 therefore it was inferred that water quality could but not decisively influence the selection of digestion especially on oxidative reactions the composition of samples was considered the main factor for digestion normally samples with higher toc 10 mgc l 1 and turbidity 2 ntu usually need further oxidation compared to samples of better quality while these samples of better quality may still need slight oxidation acidification or alkalization due to the dissolved or undissolved particles in view of digesting duration the oxidation by h2o2 needed the longest duration 2 14d compared to fenton oxidation 12 36h alkalization 24h and acidification 14h thus 14d by h2o2 was considered as a critical time where stronger oxidation was further required to shorten the digestion duration increased concentration of chemicals or higher temperature were reported to be effective hurley et al 2018 prata et al 2019a with organic rich samples the pre digesting process by h2o2 could be partially shortened to 5 7d followed by fenton oxidation notably improvements by heating and digestion duration and higher concentration particularly by alkalization and acidification could increase the risks of the modification to microplastic properties such as decolorization oxidation and even degradation hurley et al 2018 regarding the negative effects of digestion some studies demonstrated the partial degradation 18 of recovery of pvc and pet by 10 koh when increasing the temperature to 60 c and some polymers were founded to be damaged with concentrated acid e g 69 hno3 at high temperatures t 50 c karami et al 2017 actually most plastic polymers were impervious to digestion by 10 koh under controlled temperature 60 c and digestion duration 24 h li et al 2018b reducing acid concentration and operating at room temperature would protect most polymers from breaking down to minimize changes to microplastics this study was conducted at room temperature throughout all digestion processes and the alkalization digestion duration was maintained within 24h acidification was usually immediately applied before filtration more efforts on the optimization of the duration of digesting should be made in the near future 4 5 reliability of the method the infrared imager is theoretically able to detect from 1 mp particle with a size higher than 10 µm on a filter however considering the whole analysis process blank contamination is the main factor affecting this theoretical limit that is why tests were conducted to determine how many particles were found in different rinsing solutions the up water used for rinsing contained 16 mp l 1 so an effective detection limit could be estimated at 16 mp l 1 in this study to evaluate the reliability of the μ ftir coupled with simple detection method nine criteria described by koelmans et al 2019 including sampling method sample size processing and storage laboratory preparation and clean air conditions negative and positive controls sample treatment and polymer identification were self assessed in this study table 4 the details about each criterion are listed in table s4 in si the highest reliability is obtained for the highest score on negative controls mps in air and in various types of rinsing water were detected for 3 replicates section 3 2 and rinsing water up and filtered ethanol was evaluated to be insignificant the uncertainty was the control which was not systematically detected in each type of water therefore the negative control should be scored at least for 1 and probably 2 the pe solution was detected as the positive control to evaluate the μ ftir and simple method this resulted in qualified pe mps with dimensions 10 150 μm and shapes microspheres consistent with manufacturers specifications while the recovery rate was undetectable resulting in 1 score for positive control compared to koelmans et al 2019 average scoring on water samples 11 5 for treated tap water 12 5 for dwtp water 7 9 for surface water and 7 3 for wastewater it was noticed that similar scores were obtained for tap water 11 12 higher scores were obtained for surface fresh and sea waters 11 13 and wastewaters 13 14 thus demonstrating the reliability of the proposed approach to be more specific recent studies 3 years with high quality were also assessed tables s5 to s8 in si and listed in table 4 through comparison the scores 11 14 in our study still ranked in first position for wastewater and are in very good position for other types of waters compared to the average scores in koelmans et al 2019 even if some studies obtained higher scores the detection of drinking water by kirstein et al 2021 and potable water by johnson et al 2020 was also scored in first positions with scores of 13 and 14 respectively while both of them used μ ftir for mp analysis as in this study therefore the qualified scores in this study and the evidence from studies using μ ftir both demonstrated the reliability of this proposed approach some improvements can still be made by using bigger sample volumes avoiding pre rinsing the sample bottles but using bottles rinsed with filtered water using a laminar flow cabinet systematically reporting sample concentrations accounting for control values and providing positive control values 5 conclusion this study aims to develop an independent methodological approach for the identification and quantification of microplastics in different water samples sea fresh and wastewater after comparison between different rinsing waters solutions ultrapure water and filtered ethanol were selected based on the lowest number of mps found synthetic pe particles were used to verify the type and sizes obtained by μ ftir linear scan array coupled with simple software a proportional relationship was obtained between the amounts of pe particles and the filtered volume even if filtrating the highest volume possible of the sample is preferable the pretreatment of samples i e digestion was demonstrated to be crucial in summary organic matters such as proteins and cellulose can be oxidized by h2o2 or fenton some salts such as caco3 and stearate can be digested by acids whereas soft tissues can be digested with koh normally samples with higher concentration of toc higher turbidity and higher concentration of suspended solids need stronger digestion some ranges of these parameters are given to estimate the digestion mode the water quality can give some reference to the level of digestion but it is not the decisive factor and there is no specific relationship between water quality and digestion levels method duration dosage for example the toc concentration and turbidity among tertiary treated water seawater and surface water were very similar and all of them had quite low values but the tertiary treated effluents were all good enough to enable more than 500 ml to be filtered at once without digestion while this is not the case for other effluents therefore it is necessary to know the real components in the samples and choose the effective methods the concentration of chemicals and contact time are both controlled in acceptable ranges to have no or very few effects on microplastic properties according to research experiences and the literature finally considering the recent literature rigorous detection processes and high precision analytical methods to obtain the number size and type of microplastics by μ ftir linear scan array imaging were developed in this paper and will be used to assess the efficiency of the membrane treatment processes to remove mps in very different water treatment plants yang et al 2023 declaration of

15054,microplastics of millimeter dimensions have been widely investigated in environmental compartments and today studies are mainly focused on particles of smaller dimensions 500 µm however as there are no relevant standards or policies for the preparation and analysis of complex water samples containing such particles the results may be questionable therefore a methodological approach for 10 µm to 500 µm microplastic analysis was developed using μ ftir spectroscopy coupled with the simple analytical software this was undertaken on different water samples sea fresh and wastewater taking into consideration rinsing water digestion protocols collection of microplastics and sample characteristics ultrapure water was the optimal rinsing water and ethanol was also proposed with a mandatory previous filtration although water quality could give some guidelines for the selection of digestion protocols it is not the only decisive factor the methodology approach by μ ftir spectroscopy was finally assessed to be effective and reliable this improved quantitative and qualitative analytical methodology for microplastic detection can then be used to assess the removal efficiency of

retention recovery and analytical methods has been increasingly developed for the last 10 years microplastic particles mps 0 1 μm 5 mm originate either from primary manufactured or secondary degraded plastic objects frias and nash 2019 annually in europe polymer production increased greatly from 0 35 million tons in the 1950s to 55 million tons in 2020 while 63 000 to 430 000 tons of microplastics enter farmland through compost sludges application nizzetto et al 2016 and around 2461 8627 tons of microplastics enter marine environments annually jambeck et al 2015 lebreton et al 2017 sherrington et al 2016 massive amounts of mps have caused increasingly adverse effects on humans and the environment 1 mps can be swallowed by organisms and transported through food chains rillig 2012 for instance ragusa et al 2021 discovered the presence of mps 5 10 μm in human placentas and sussarellu et al 2016 found polystyrene particles ps 2 6 µm translocated in blood circulation leading to reproductive disruption for marine filter feeders 2 some mps could release toxic compounds such as dioxins phthalates vinyl chloride etc certain additives such as plasticizers stabilizers and pigments added by manufacturers to plastics are mostly hazardous substances nobre et al 2015 3 mps could induce chronic toxicity which was considered as a key issue for long term exposure campanale et al 2020 prata et al 2019a 4 mps could act as vectors for toxic organic substances and microorganisms nobre et al 2015 yang et al 2022 moreover old microplastics could be further degraded into smaller microparticles or even nanoparticles jambeck et al 2015 however public perception of the risks induced by microplastics is low and few countries or regions have issued relevant detection method standards and production limitation policies among present analytical methods micro fourier transform infrared μ ftir spectroscopy is an advanced analytical approach for testing mps it is a non destructive analytical technique which can produce infrared absorption spectra for both thick and opaque materials shim et al 2017 generally sample pretreatment is necessary to avoid the shelter of microplastics by organic and inorganic materials and to allow their precise identification after digestion the common digestion protocols include oxidation alkaline or acidic treatment and enzymatic degradation stock et al 2019 sun et al 2019 h2o2 and fenton reagent are the most used chemicals for oxidative digestion which have no or very few effects on microplastic properties hurley et al 2018 tagg et al 2015a according to prata et al 2019a 95 of 20 sediment studies used h2o2 and or fenton reagent for digestion and higher than 60 of 20 studies of water samples mainly seawater and freshwater used h2o2 for digestion a similar conclusion was also inferred from the survey in table s1 in supplementary information si in comparison fenton reagent is effective in accelerating digestion rates when compared to h2o2 hurley et al 2018 alkaline digestion with 10 koh solution is highly recommended for sea animals or seawater digestion since it can break down soft tissue and bivalve tissues in marine samples thiele et al 2019 koh is also useful for the digestion of natural organic matter feathers fat etc enzymatic digestion is a rapid reaction for complete degradation of organics while it is considered as an expensive complex and sometimes destructive method on mp extraction prata et al 2019b density separation with nacl nai and zncl2 could be coupled with other digestion processes to isolate mps li et al 2018a but showed lower recovery on smaller and denser mps radford et al 2021 currently the digestion protocols for microplastic recovery are mostly based on experiments from the literature the preparation methods are not yet standardized in view of the rinsing process most studies used ultrapure water 63 in 27 studies with or without ethanol and 44 without ethanol and secondly used distilled water for investigation shown in table s2 in si since particles from rinsing could easily stick to surfaces and remain thus leading to contamination of the sample certain criteria need to be met for rinsing 1 evaluation of the existence of mps in potential rinsing water solution and potentially filtrating it before use 2 determination of the reliable rinsing water solution with minimum mps prior to experiments however fewer studies completed the above steps thus it is necessary to investigate the presence of mps in the rinsing water solution to avoid external interference additionally considering the expression of mps concentration fewer researchers filtered 1 l of samples for analysis while others particularly for organic rich samples maybe filtered only several milliliters simon et al 2018 most of them calculated mp concentration by assuming the proportional relationship between the filtered volume and the mp counts but without accurately determining it therefore actual drawbacks of mp analysis sometimes include the incomplete recovery of mps from different samples the selection of appropriate digestion method vs nature of samples the limitation on quantification and identification of mps and the global accuracy of analytical results therefore this study aims to develop a method for the identification type and size and quantification of mps in different water samples efforts have been made for the improvement of detection accuracy selection of purified rinsing water suitable sampling and digestion methods depending on the water type rigorous detection process and high precision analytical methods to obtain the counts dimensions and type of microplastics by μ ftir in reflectance mode 2 material and methods 2 1 sample sources three types of water were analyzed and their location was shown in fig 1 i samples from a seawater treatment plant swtp which aims to treat seawater from shellfish farms to produce purified seawater ii samples from four different wastewater treatment plants wwtp and iii samples from three drinking water treatment plants dwtp the detailed information of each site is shown in table 1 to avoid external pollution all samples were collected and transported via 1 l glass bottles and frozen until analysis 2 2 sample pretreatment the commonly used rinsing water solutions tested in this study included evian water ultrapure water up water labostar twf7 siemens distilled water di tap water hplc water 34877 2 5l m sigma aldrich and ethanol both in polyethylene pe and glass bottles ethanol absolute vwr usa three digestion methods were investigated in this study firstly samples can be digested with h2o2 30 w v fisher chemical at volume ratio vsample vh2o2 from 1 1 to 1 2 for 1 14 days secondly and for stronger oxidation samples can be digested with fenton reagent 0 05 m feso4 7h2 o with 30 h2o2 at volume ratio of 1 1 feso4 7h2o solution was made by dissolving 2 5 g of feso4 7h2o analytical reagent grade fisher scientific in 165 ml up water and ultrapure water labostar twf7 siemens acidified and with 1 ml of concentrated h2so4 95 fisher scientific thirdly some more recalcitrant samples need digestion with 10 w v koh purity 85 fischer chemicals for 24 72 h and h2so4 can be finally added to adjust ph and eliminate alkaline precipitation all operations were conducted in cleaned glass devices and covered with aluminum foil to prevent airborne contamination all digestion processes were operated at room temperature 25 c the handling of samples was carried out under controlled air conditions in a cleaned fume hood and operators wore cotton laboratory coats throughout the experiment turbidity of water samples was measured using wtw turb 550 ir in nephelometric turbidity unit ntu the relative error of this method is 2 total organic carbon toc was measured using a shimadzu tocl lcsh csn toc analyzer detailed information is shown in si section 2 2 3 mp collection before analysis the final step before μ ftir imaging was the filtration of samples three types of filters were used 3 or 5 μm gold coated polyester membranes i3 trackpor p germany and 25 μm stainless steel filters in reflectance mode the gold material and stainless steel slides were both good choices as background as they can reflect infrared radiation with almost no absorption gonzalez torres et al 2017 the samples were then filtered through a vacuum büchner funnel apparatus fisher scientific sweden fig s1 in si the filtration masks were round metal discs with a square hole in the center to regulate the sedimentation area on the filters square holes with sides of 5500 and 10 000 μm were respectively used on gold coated filters and stainless steel filters for samples with visible particles and solids a two stage filtration was performed firstly using the stainless steel filter then using the gold coated filter the result for such a sample corresponds to the sum of mps on each filter for cleaner purified water samples the filtration was achieved directly on a gold filter before and after analysis by μ ftir spectroscopy the filter with the collected sample was stored in a glass petri dish to avoid any external pollution 2 4 μ ftir spectroscopy the detection of microplastics was achieved with the μ ftir imaging system spotlight 400 μ ftir microscope perkinelmer usa the detection system is mainly composed of four parts the μ ftir spectrometer the spectrum spotlight 400 μ ftir microscope the stage control for sample view movement in automatic and manual modes and the computer for data treatment the microscope detector is a highly sensitive liquid nitrogen cooled mercury cadmium telluride detector ln mct for smaller particles 10 μm in this study the spectrometer was set up to reflectance mode with a linear scan array detector this detector assembly enables rapid analysis of thick and opaque samples and is highly suitable for detecting for example microplastics in environmental samples tagg et al 2015b a 16 cm 1 spectral resolution was used as the best compromise between spectral quality and acquisition rapidity zheng et al 2021 background spectrum imaging was collected from the gold filter both at 6 25 μm or 25 μm pixels the other identification parameters of μ ftir are 2 scans per pixel an interferometer velocity of 2 2 cm s 1 an infrared spectral range of 4000 690 cm 1 and an imaging resolution of 6 25 μm or 25 μm depending on the filters for each sample the μ ftir generated an absorbance image 1 5 h duration per filter with infrared spectrum information on each pixel 2 5 simple for rapid identification and quantification of microplastics to identify microplastic structures in this study a freeware simple developed by aalborg university denmark and alfred wegener institute germany https simple plastics eu was adopted the reference database contains most polymers and natural materials such as protein and cellulose a total of 23 material types found in table s3 in si primpke et al 2020a verified the high sensitivity and high accuracy for microplastic identification by simple with greater than 95 correct assignment rates on spectra simple can provide parameters on polymer types range of abscissa and ordinates number of pixels minor major dimensions surface area and estimated volume and mass of each particle nevertheless the volume μm3 l 1 and mass concentrations mg l 1 were not provided for comparison and quantification due to the large error probabilities because evidence was lacking for the assumptive thickness 0 67 times the minor dimension and stereostructure ellipsoid mintenig et al 2020 simon et al 2018 in this study mp concentrations were expressed in quantity mp l 1 and surface area μm2 l 1 to better understand the structure and distribution of particles in real waters 2 6 selection of rinsing water solution this section is designed to investigate the microplastic abundance in the commonly used rinsing water solutions such as evian water ultrapure water up water distilled water tap water hplc water reference 34877 2 5l m sigma aldrich and ethanol both in pe bottles and glass bottles ethanol absolute vwr usa each rinsing solution was analyzed at least three times and the glass devices were first rinsed with ultrapure water then rinsed with 0 5 or 1 l of the tested liquid before filtration 2 7 verification of type and dimensions of polyethylene microspheres and of proportionality between the quantity of mp and water volume synthetic pe microspheres 0 96 g cm 3 10 150 μm from cospheric usa were used as referral mps moreover due to their hydrophobic properties pe particles were oxidized under uv light for 5 days 400 w 60 c in sepap 12 24 atlas to limit their uneven temporal and spatial distribution in up water it was verified that their spectra under atr ftir verification were not modified with uv irradiation the μ ftir images of pe microspheres are shown in fig 2 the dispersed pe particles in red were chosen for size analysis statistical data analysis was performed using microsoft office excel 2016 and spss version 22 spss inc the test for normal distribution used the shapiro wilk test on distribution of particle dimensions and showed that both minor dimensions dmin and major dimensions dmaj of pe fitted with a normal distribution normality test p value 0 05 resulting in 50 dmin 100 μm and 100 dmaj 150 μm respectively the minor dimensions of pe beads are in the range of 50 to 100 μm and their major dimensions are in the range of 100 to 150 μm which agreed with the manufacturer s data in the most recent work the concentrations of microplastics are expressed in mp l 1 and in addition they are expressed in μm2 l 1 surface area of mp covering the filter to better consider the size and shapes of the particles mintenig et al 2020 most of previous studies calculated microplastic concentration as they assume the proportional relationship between the filtered volume and the number of microplastics but without any proof therefore it is of interest to investigate the accuracy and feasibility of this assumption to confirm whether the filtered volume and the mp counts were positively related two experiments were designed to investigate 1 mp concentrations in different volumes 250 500 1000 and 2000 ml of up water and 2 pe mp concentrations in different volumes 250 500 1000 and 2000 ml of synthetic pe suspension 0 1 mg l 1 in this part the 0 1 mg l 1 pe suspension was diluted from a 10 mg l 1 pe stock solution pe stock solution was stirred for at least 1 h before sampling the synthetic pe suspensions were firstly stirred for 1 h and then sonicated for 15 min before filtration to promote the uniform distribution of pe in water each sample was measured in triplicates and all were filtered through the 5 μm gold coated filters the pe mp concentration in synthetic pe suspensions excluded the amount of pe in up water the relative error of mp concentration in different volumes was calculated based on eq 1 1 e 1 c mps c mps ave 100 where cmps mp l 1 represents the quantitative mp concentration in tested samples cmps ave mp l 1 represents the average mp concentration among different volumes of samples a one way analysis of variance anova was conducted for a linear regression test on particle numbers all tests were statistically verified with p values under 0 05 3 results 3 1 identification and quantification of microplastic particles using μ ftir and simple in this study it was first confirmed that the identification of mps on one sample a filter by μ ftir and simple was consistent with the results for 3 replicates using the same procedures furthermore the results were consistent with the detection by atr ftir on known pe mps section 2 7 thus the detection by μ ftir and simple showed a valid identification concerning mps to obtain highly accurate results the differences between two imaging resolutions of μ ftir 6 25 μm and 25 μm were investigated the results and discussion are shown in figs s2 and s3 in si in this study the image on 25 μm filters used 25 μm resolution and the image on 3 or 5 μm filters used 6 25 μm resolution 3 2 filtration apparatus efficiency and rinsing water solution selection table 2 showed the results of abundances types and dimensions of mps and total particles tps in different types of rinsing water under 6 25 μm imaging air quality was tested by filtering air through the gold filter by a vacuum pump at 80 kpa under the fume hood for 30 min forty six tps and only 2 pe mps were detected confirming that air had no effect on results concerning mps found on the filter the filtration of all water samples 1 l through the gold coated filter 5 μm was rapid 30 s and replicated n 3 ethanol either in glass or pe bottles contained hundreds of mps most in pe and is thus not recommended for rinsing directly di water was ranked second highest for mp concentration while hplc water exhibited the lowest concentration the mp concentrations in evian tap water and up water were middle ranged while up water contained the lowest concentration of tps since di and up water were both generated from tap water the increased mp concentration and mp types pet eva might be related to process contamination due to polymer pipes taps or filters and the purified process contributed to tp removal considering these results the following water solutions were not applied for rinsing in this study tap and di water were excluded due to the large amount of tps untreated ethanol due to abundant mps hplc water due to expense and evian water due to the considerable cost and the presence of large particles dmaj 20 200 μm dmin 16 100 μm up water contained acceptable mp concentration the lowest quantity of tps and smaller dimensions of mps ethanol is often recommended due to its merits in both hydrophilicity and lipophilicity it was suggested that ethanol was prefiltered through a 1 μm non plastic membrane to limit the mp abundance before use therefore up water and filtered ethanol filtered by 0 22 μm pes membrane 10 mp l 1 were recommended for rinsing additionally the volume of rinsing water was limited within 50 ml 1 0 0 4 mps which caused an insignificant influence on mp results 3 3 abundance and distribution of mps vs analyzed water volume in up water the statistical test showed a positive correlation between mp concentration and filtered volume p value 0 004 0 05 r2 0 9745 as shown in fig 3 in fig 3 a mp concentration became stable when the filtered volume was higher than 500 ml which was consistent with the results obtained by prata et al 2020 the relative error based on eq 1 decreased with increasing filtered volume resulting in 13 6 500 ml 11 9 1000 ml 3 8 2000 ml in mp enriched suspension fig 4 pe mp concentration resulted in positive correlations p value 0 038 0 05 r2 0 8995 with filtered volumes of 0 1 mg l 1 pe synthetic suspensions moreover pe mp concentration tended to stabilize when the filtered volume was higher than 1000 ml as a result it can be inferred that mp concentrations were positively related to the filtered volumes particularly both up water and pe synthetic suspensions did not contain organic matter therefore organic poor samples with volumes higher than 500 ml were considered as an optimum compromise between the drawbacks and the reliability of the results however in actual conditions samples may contain millions of mps per liter and be rich in organics for which their analysis may be impossible to complete by one time detection according to anger et al 2018 and karlsson et al 2020 mp counts in subsamples fitted with continuous gaussian distribution when samples were heavily contaminated by mps thus subsamples provided higher probability of accuracy more precisely it is necessary to have smaller volume of subsamples 500 ml but more replicates 4 10 times to improve the accuracy and reliability of results accordingly samples in this study were separated into two groups organic poor samples once filtered volume 500 ml and organic rich samples once filtered volume 500 ml in fact 500 1000 ml of organic poor samples were tested once and with 2 3 replicates 0 500 ml organic rich samples were tested once and with 4 10 replicates to increase the reliability of samples table 3 4 digestion protocol in this study transparent samples with no visible suspended particles were not digested and thus directly filtered these include tap water di water ultrapure water evian water hplc water ethanol tertiary treated effluents from dwtps wwtps and swtps such as uf permeate 1 and 0 2 μm outlets otherwise for other samples from dwtps wwtps and swtps a digestion process was necessary the choice of digestion methods in different samples was explored and discussed in the following sections the thoroughness of the digestion was closely related to temperature dose of chemicals and reaction duration in this study the dose of chemicals was added based on the literature experiments and testing in the lab 4 1 digestion of samples from wwtps with h2o2 and fenton in view of the fact that secondary effluents from wwtps usually caused dense fouling on gold coated filters which became unusable for infrared spectroscopy fig 5 a showed the filter image after the filtration of 50 ml secondary effluent from wwtp 4 resulting in severe dark fouling cake after digestion for one day 1d with h2o2 after digestion with h2o2 for 7 10 d the filter became much cleaner with reaction time increases fig 5 b c similar results were obtained on other samples from wwtps thus the digestion process with 30 h2o2 vsample vh2o2 1 2 showed effective oxidation effects on all secondary effluents from wwtps with a reaction time from 3 to 10 days as presented in table 3 as raw wastewater is expected to contain higher concentrations of organic matters and particles compared to treated effluents the digestion by h2o2 vsample vh2o2 2 1 was insufficient to completely oxidize the organic matter the samples were still opaque and turbid after 14 days of oxidation even though the volume ratio of h2o2 to raw wastewater was increased from 1 1 to 2 1 fig 6 a c μ ftir spectral imaging demonstrated that the main components identified in raw wastewater from wwtp 1 were proteins fig 6 c1 fenton reagent could provide stronger digestion effects on organic rich samples in less time and with less impact on microplastic chemistry or size tagg et al 2016 therefore fenton reagent vsample vfenton 4 1 was added into the mixture after 14 days of oxidation with h2o2 at a ph between 2 5 and 3 5 to avoid iron oxide precipitation pilli et al 2015 the image of the sample after another 24 h digestion is shown in fig 6 d the sample became much cleaner and transparent with the complete decomposition of proteins after 24 h of fenton reaction observed in fig 6 d1 d2 therefore it could be inferred that h2o2 was able to digest secondary effluents vsample vh2o2 2 1 with the availability to be able to digest organic matter in samples but neither proteins nor cellulose in this case fenton digestion as a stronger oxidative reagent showed effective decomposition of protein cellulose rich samples such as raw wastewater in a faster more complete process thus it is suggested to sequentially use digestion by h2o2 and fenton for raw wastewater samples the h2o2 was firstly added vsample vh2o2 1 1 to 1 2 to partially oxidize the samples within 3 to 14 days then fenton was added to the mixture vsample vfenton 4 1 to 2 1 to finalize the digestion of the sample within 12 to 36 h 4 2 digestion of seawater from swtp with h2o2 and koh seawater samples seawater zeo a outlet zeo b outlet were first digested by one step h2o2 but resulting in an insignificant improvement on filtration even when digested for more than 10 days fifteen ml net volume of samples could completely foul the gold filters as shown in fig s4 a1 a2 in si since seawater might contain shellfish and plant algae tissues 10 w v koh was added to samples which could break down soft tissue and bivalve tissues thiele et al 2019 however some calcium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide were generated after 10 koh was applied which made the solution white and turbid therefore 10 h2so4 was added drop by drop into the solution to eliminate the insoluble alkaline precipitation after 12 h of koh digestion afterward the visible survey of seawater samples became much clearer for identification and quantification fig s4 b1 b2 in si finally the seawater samples of up to 37 5 ml net sample volume can be filtered through the gold coated filters validating the digestion process of koh and h2so4 acidification on seawater samples 4 3 digestion of surface and underground water with acid and h2o2 the water qualities of surface water and underground water were significantly better than the inlets from wwtps and swtp with transparent and slightly visible particles nevertheless these samples needed digestion due to their components for example underground water from dwtp 1 needed acid 10 h2so4 to dissolve the caco3 which formed a white cake on the gold coated filter and covered mps and had a negative effect on infrared detection as shown in fig s5 a2 in si the components of surface water seemed to be somewhat more complex than underground water as it contained caco3 proteins and cellulose together with some hard to digest but unknown substances fig s5 c1 c2 c3 in si the digestion of surface water from dwtp 3 concerned a combined treatment with alkali 10 koh followed by acid 10 h2so4 which was applied to surface water from dwtp 3 samples from dwtp 2 were clean enough to be filtered through 5 μm filters thus with no digestion requirement 4 4 discussion on digestion improvement the digestion protocols used for the preparation of water samples and the filtered volume obtained on gold filters together with some parameters of the water samples toc concentration and turbidity are shown in table 3 notably samples without any digestion requirement were excluded such as in the uf permeates and dwtp2 samples the quality of samples without digestion was good enough to be filtered directly all with turbidity 1 0 ntu toc 6 0 mgc l 1 transparent and with non visible suspended particles samples with digestion requirements were discussed as follows in wwtps the decreased toc concentration and turbidity in secondary effluents showed mild digesting with 5 6 d h2o2 while raw wastewaters required 7 14 days of digestion with h2o2 and 12 24 h fenton reaction in swtp samples containing lower toc concentration 2 0 3 0 mgc l 1 but significant turbidity 1 3 6 3 ntu the coupling of h2o2 and koh was sufficient for digestion without further oxidation by fenton probably due to the dissolved undissolved solids salts minerals and tissues al dahaan et al 2016 samples from dwtps had the best qualities with the lowest toc concentration 0 5 1 3 mgc l 1 and turbidity 0 34 1 2 ntu dwtp 2 samples demanded no digestion while dwtp 1 samples needed slight oxidation by h2o2 and dwtp 3 samples needed further acidification mainly due to the existence of proteins cellulose and caco3 therefore it was inferred that water quality could but not decisively influence the selection of digestion especially on oxidative reactions the composition of samples was considered the main factor for digestion normally samples with higher toc 10 mgc l 1 and turbidity 2 ntu usually need further oxidation compared to samples of better quality while these samples of better quality may still need slight oxidation acidification or alkalization due to the dissolved or undissolved particles in view of digesting duration the oxidation by h2o2 needed the longest duration 2 14d compared to fenton oxidation 12 36h alkalization 24h and acidification 14h thus 14d by h2o2 was considered as a critical time where stronger oxidation was further required to shorten the digestion duration increased concentration of chemicals or higher temperature were reported to be effective hurley et al 2018 prata et al 2019a with organic rich samples the pre digesting process by h2o2 could be partially shortened to 5 7d followed by fenton oxidation notably improvements by heating and digestion duration and higher concentration particularly by alkalization and acidification could increase the risks of the modification to microplastic properties such as decolorization oxidation and even degradation hurley et al 2018 regarding the negative effects of digestion some studies demonstrated the partial degradation 18 of recovery of pvc and pet by 10 koh when increasing the temperature to 60 c and some polymers were founded to be damaged with concentrated acid e g 69 hno3 at high temperatures t 50 c karami et al 2017 actually most plastic polymers were impervious to digestion by 10 koh under controlled temperature 60 c and digestion duration 24 h li et al 2018b reducing acid concentration and operating at room temperature would protect most polymers from breaking down to minimize changes to microplastics this study was conducted at room temperature throughout all digestion processes and the alkalization digestion duration was maintained within 24h acidification was usually immediately applied before filtration more efforts on the optimization of the duration of digesting should be made in the near future 4 5 reliability of the method the infrared imager is theoretically able to detect from 1 mp particle with a size higher than 10 µm on a filter however considering the whole analysis process blank contamination is the main factor affecting this theoretical limit that is why tests were conducted to determine how many particles were found in different rinsing solutions the up water used for rinsing contained 16 mp l 1 so an effective detection limit could be estimated at 16 mp l 1 in this study to evaluate the reliability of the μ ftir coupled with simple detection method nine criteria described by koelmans et al 2019 including sampling method sample size processing and storage laboratory preparation and clean air conditions negative and positive controls sample treatment and polymer identification were self assessed in this study table 4 the details about each criterion are listed in table s4 in si the highest reliability is obtained for the highest score on negative controls mps in air and in various types of rinsing water were detected for 3 replicates section 3 2 and rinsing water up and filtered ethanol was evaluated to be insignificant the uncertainty was the control which was not systematically detected in each type of water therefore the negative control should be scored at least for 1 and probably 2 the pe solution was detected as the positive control to evaluate the μ ftir and simple method this resulted in qualified pe mps with dimensions 10 150 μm and shapes microspheres consistent with manufacturers specifications while the recovery rate was undetectable resulting in 1 score for positive control compared to koelmans et al 2019 average scoring on water samples 11 5 for treated tap water 12 5 for dwtp water 7 9 for surface water and 7 3 for wastewater it was noticed that similar scores were obtained for tap water 11 12 higher scores were obtained for surface fresh and sea waters 11 13 and wastewaters 13 14 thus demonstrating the reliability of the proposed approach to be more specific recent studies 3 years with high quality were also assessed tables s5 to s8 in si and listed in table 4 through comparison the scores 11 14 in our study still ranked in first position for wastewater and are in very good position for other types of waters compared to the average scores in koelmans et al 2019 even if some studies obtained higher scores the detection of drinking water by kirstein et al 2021 and potable water by johnson et al 2020 was also scored in first positions with scores of 13 and 14 respectively while both of them used μ ftir for mp analysis as in this study therefore the qualified scores in this study and the evidence from studies using μ ftir both demonstrated the reliability of this proposed approach some improvements can still be made by using bigger sample volumes avoiding pre rinsing the sample bottles but using bottles rinsed with filtered water using a laminar flow cabinet systematically reporting sample concentrations accounting for control values and providing positive control values 5 conclusion this study aims to develop an independent methodological approach for the identification and quantification of microplastics in different water samples sea fresh and wastewater after comparison between different rinsing waters solutions ultrapure water and filtered ethanol were selected based on the lowest number of mps found synthetic pe particles were used to verify the type and sizes obtained by μ ftir linear scan array coupled with simple software a proportional relationship was obtained between the amounts of pe particles and the filtered volume even if filtrating the highest volume possible of the sample is preferable the pretreatment of samples i e digestion was demonstrated to be crucial in summary organic matters such as proteins and cellulose can be oxidized by h2o2 or fenton some salts such as caco3 and stearate can be digested by acids whereas soft tissues can be digested with koh normally samples with higher concentration of toc higher turbidity and higher concentration of suspended solids need stronger digestion some ranges of these parameters are given to estimate the digestion mode the water quality can give some reference to the level of digestion but it is not the decisive factor and there is no specific relationship between water quality and digestion levels method duration dosage for example the toc concentration and turbidity among tertiary treated water seawater and surface water were very similar and all of them had quite low values but the tertiary treated effluents were all good enough to enable more than 500 ml to be filtered at once without digestion while this is not the case for other effluents therefore it is necessary to know the real components in the samples and choose the effective methods the concentration of chemicals and contact time are both controlled in acceptable ranges to have no or very few effects on microplastic properties according to research experiences and the literature finally considering the recent literature rigorous detection processes and high precision analytical methods to obtain the number size and type of microplastics by μ ftir linear scan array imaging were developed in this paper and will be used to assess the efficiency of the membrane treatment processes to remove mps in very different water treatment plants yang et al 2023 declaration of
