19920,amyloid adhesins are β sheet rich extracellular proteins thought to contribute to bioflocculation they are present in activated sludge to varying extent however it remains unclear which operational conditions promote their production to this end the abundance and distribution of amyloids and their potential producers were monitored in two lab scale reactors operated in sequencing batch mode with an unaerated and aerated reaction phase various feeding regimes ranging from feast famine to nearly continuous feeding were applied thioflavin t staining revealed more amyloids in the lab scale reactors during all operational stages compared to the full scale industrial and municipal inocula furthermore the feeding regime impacted the distribution of produced amyloids from dense clusters during feast famine conditions towards a dispersed distribution during nearly continuous feeding this dispersed presence did not negatively impact the bioflocculation towards average floc size and shear sensitivity 16s rrna sequencing detected several known eps and amyloid producers more continuous and hence partially aerobic feeding promoted the relative abundance of denitrifiers sequential thioflavin t staining and fluorescence in situ hybridization identified zoogloea and ca competibacter as potential amyloid producers under the applied conditions this experiment confirms that amyloid producers need to be triggered for production and that the feeding regime impacts the microbial community composition which in turn influences the amyloid production and distribution graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biological wastewater treatment bioflocculation extracellular polymeric substances thioflavin t clsm microbial community data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the performance and cost efficiency of biological wastewater treatment systems highly depend on the ability of the activated sludge bacteria to form large and dense flocs such that an efficient sludge water separation can be ensured a crucial element for the structural integrity of these flocs is the matrix of extracellular polymeric substances eps in which the activated sludge bacteria are embedded suresh et al 2018 in the proteinaceous fraction of the eps various adhesins exist that are distinguished by their structure and specific mechanism of cell to cell interaction e g flagella pili lectins and amyloid adhesins these latter structures are β sheet rich and highly organized proteins that are insoluble and resistant to many chemical and mechanical denaturants and protease activity christensen et al 2020 epstein and chapman 2008 most of the information about the role of bacterial amyloids in bio aggregation is inferred from pure culture biofilm studies of bacteria that have limited relevance in wastewater treatment e g e coli pseudomonas and bacillus subtillis aqeel et al 2019 amyloids improve the adherence properties and mechanical robustness of these biofilms inspired by these results from the domain of pure cultures amyloid adhesins are thought to contribute to the high stability of the strongly bound fraction of cells and eps in activated sludge flocs larsen et al 2008 yet this hypothesis has not been investigated thoroughly to the best of the authors knowledge nonetheless amyloids have been detected in activated sludge systems in biofilms flocs and aerobic granules dueholm and nielsen 2016 lin et al 2018 aqeel et al 2021 pure culture studies on model organisms have revealed some conditions in which amyloid production is enhanced such as low temperature low oxygen content low osmolarity and nutrient limitation e g fe3 limitation for pseudomonas gerstel and römling 2001 maurer et al 1998 prigent combaret et al 2001 scharfman et al 1996 however these observations are often organism dependent or the applied conditions may not be possible or may be less appropriate to implement within the context of wastewater treatment if amyloid adhesins can be linked to strong bioflocculation and if their production can be promoted by certain operational conditions we have a powerful tool to optimize the sludge water separation part of activated sludge systems this work therefore i investigated the possibility of stimulating amyloid adhesin production in an activated sludge community by changing the feeding pattern in a sequencing batch reactor sbr setup while ii screening the activated sludge bacterial community for the corresponding amyloid producers the original research hypothesis was that a more continuous feeding would induce a decrease in adhesin production and a concomitant deterioration of the bioflocculation the latter is monitored through floc size and strength 2 materials and methods 2 1 parallel sequencing batch reactor set up and operation the reactors consisted of 4 l glass cylindrical vessels stirred using a magnetic stirring

thioflavin t tht has long been the gold standard to detect protein misfolding in the medical field and has also been used to detect functional amyloids in bacteria this dye is characterized by a large increase in fluorescence upon binding to amyloids biancalana and koide 2010 more recently antibodies have also been used for amyloid detection e g conformational antibodies wo1 and wo2 and antibodies against csga and csgb curli proteins expressed in e coli brei 2011 chapman et al 2002 o nuallain and wetzel 2002 in this work the thioflavin t tht dye was used to detect amyloid adhesins in the activated sludge sample as it is commercially available unlike the mentioned conformational antibodies and will bind to diverse amyloid structures in various organisms unlike the sequence specific antibodies tht powder thermo fisher scientific was dissolved in milli q water and filtered through a 0 2 µm syringe filter the concentration of the stock solution was determined spectrophotometrically by absorbance measurement at 412 nm from this the concentration was calculated via the lambert beer law with the molar extinction coefficient equal to 36 000 m 1 cm 1 for thioflavin t in water de ferrari et al 2001 to perform the staining fresh samples were diluted to 1 g mlss l 1 tht was added to a final concentration of 3 µm and incubated 15 min room temperature the tht fluorescence signal was visualized using an olympus fluo view fv1000 confocal microscope equipped with 440 nm laser 405 458 nm dichroic mirror and 480 495 nm barrier filter laser intensity percentage and detector voltage were chosen such that all observable autofluorescence on an unstained sample was minimized the transmission signal was collected as a reference image processing was performed in fiji schindelin et al 2012 the color intensity of the images was slightly adjusted for improved resolution the tht fluorescence signal was quantified in a 96 well plate art no 655090 greiner bio one international gmbh kremsmünster austria in four technical replicates using a tecan infinite m200 pro microplate reader with i control 1 9 software an emission scan was performed from 440 to 650 nm with a 10 nm stepsize

modifications briefly 700 ml of 3 5 g mlss l 1 sludge was sheared for up to 300 min in a baffled reactor at a constant shear intensity g 800 s 1 the turbidity of the supernatant was measured every 30

al 2013 graphs were generated using ms excel 2 5 fluorescence in situ hybridization and identification of amyloid producers via a sequential procedure fluorescence in situ hybridization fish was performed as described by amann 1995 using the probes described below for direct identification of amyloid producers an optimized protocol of sequential tht staining and fish is proposed based on larsen et al 2007 first activated sludge was stained with tht followed by an initial localization and recording of several flocs on a glass coverslip after that the sample was dried on the coverslip and if still needed fixed for 2 h with 4 paraformaldehyde pfa for fixation of gram negative cells the dehydration and hybridization were performed as described by amann 1995 finally the same flocs were localized again and recorded to avoid biomass wash off during this procedure glass cover slips were pretreated by rinsing with 70 ethanol for degreasing followed by dipping into 0 5 w v gelatin and 0 01 crk so4 2 at 70 c to improve adhesion nielsen et al 2009 to facilitate floc localization coverslips with a 500 µm grid ibidi were used the identity of some bacteria in sludge samples was investigated using the following oligonucleotide probes zra23a targeting members of the zoogloea lineage except z resiniphila rosselló mora et al 1995 gaomix equimolar mixture of gb g1 and gb g2 for several ca competibacter crocetti et al 2002 kong et al 2002 and eubmix equimolar mixture of eub 338 eub338 ii and eub338 iii targeting most bacteria amann et al 1990 daims et al 1999 details are summarized in probebase loy et al 2007 probes were double labeled at the 5 and 3 end with the same fluorophore either 6 carboxyfluorescein 6 fam or the sulfoindocyanine dye cy3 all probes were purchased from biomers germany the fluorescence signal was visualized on an olympus fluoview fv1000 confocal microscope with a 488 nm laser and 505 540 nm barrier filter for 6 fam and a 559 nm laser and 575 620 nm barrier filter for cy3 multi channel datasets were recorded in sequential mode to avoid crosstalk 3 results results for the reactors inoculated with sludge from industrial and municipal origin are hereafter referred to as the industrial and municipal lab scale sbr 3 1 evolution of amyloids detected with thioflavin t samples subjected to different feeding conditions were characterized using 3 µm tht targeting most amyloid adhesins visual detection based on microscopic images as well as quantification of the emission signal is performed as for the visual detection z stack images were studied in 3 d but are represented here in 2 d as maximum intensity projections with the transmission image included as a structural reference to distinguish unstained regions from voids fig 3 in dense flocs such as present in the industrial sbr at the end of the first operational stage the light penetration was limited to a depth of around 25 µm which should be considered when interpreting the clsm results tht positive areas were abundant in the inoculum originating from the industrial wastewater treatment plant wwtp and detected as characteristic spherical clusters with a diameter of 11 16 4 19 µm n 6 in comparison tht positive areas were scattered and less abundant in the inoculum originating from the municipal plant a qualitative increase in tht positive areas was observed in both reactors during the first operational stage in later stages characterized by more frequent feeding the tht signal appeared less clustered and more evenly spread throughout the sludge floc tht also stained elongated structures representing filamentous bacteria or epiphytic attachments the spatial arrangement of the fluorescent signal in the floc was further studied from the 3 d reconstructions in depth coding mode with the 16 colors color scale fig 4 single optical sections are overlapped after attributing one color to each of them colors range from white to black corresponding to the lowest slice i e closest to the objective and highest slice i e furthest away from the objective respectively this representation preserves some depth information in a 2 d image the emission signal mostly appears to be present throughout the entire floc depth additionally the tht emission signal of sludge suspensions was quantified at the excitation maximum of 490 nm results are corrected for sample autofluorescence and reported in fig 5 a similar trend was observed for both reactors after inoculation the fluorescence intensity steadily increased until an equilibrium was achieved at the end of stage 1 after a delay the signal then increased further in the later stages characterized by more frequent and hence aerobic feeding 3 2 bioflocculation performance the largest average floc size was observed in the industrial lab scale reactor while subjected to feast famine conditions fig 6 afterwards the average floc size decreased gradually and remained stable during the third operational stage no strong trends were observed in the municipal lab scale sbr but the average floc size was generally the lowest when subjected to nearly continuous feeding stage 3 sensitivity to turbulent shear was relatively low for both reactors throughout the experiment with fluctuating values fig 7 the lowest values for k s s were measured near the end of the first operational stage day 30 and 44 for industrial and municipal lab scale reactor respectively 3 3 reactor performance and community dynamics the activated sludge community dynamics is first described on the family level to then zoom in on the genus level which is finally correlated to the reactor performance by including an anoxic phase the sbrs were expected to have a high nitrogen removal on top of the conventional organic carbon cod removal under aerobic conditions autotrophic nitrifiers can oxidize nh4 to no3 which under anoxic conditions heterotrophic denitrifiers can reduce to n2 however while a cod removal of at least 98 1 industrial sbr and 95 8 municipal sbr was achieved the nitrogen removal was impaired after stage 1 as discussed below on average 65 716 58 reads per sample n 12 samples were obtained from illumina miseq reads with a frequency lower than 18 were removed this cut off equals 0 05 percent of the average read abundance after dada2 denoising at the family level top part of fig 8 rhodocyclaceae were detected in all stages but became more abundant in the industrial lab scale sbr during stages 2 and 3 of reactor operation with a 35 46 and 26 53 relative read abundance respectively at these time points also the flavobacteriaceae were abundant with 21 58 and 8 58 in the industrial lab scale sbr in the municipal lab scale sbr the family competibacter became more abundant in stage 3 at the genus level bottom part of fig 8 the results are summarized here in functional groups the abundance of ammonium and nitrite oxidizing genera decreased for both reactors throughout the reactor run these microbial community dynamics were reflected in an increase of nh4 and a decrease of no3 in stage 3 fig 10 regarding denitrifying bacteria during stage 1 rhodocyclaceae related zoogloea were abundant in the industrial lab scale sbr increase to 10 74 and in the municipal lab scale sbr maximum of 5 78 see also fig 9 the abundance of rhodocyclaceae related thauera increased to 4 80 and 3 31 for the industrial and municipal lab scale sbr respectively in the municipal lab scale reactor the abundance of dechloromonas remained high with a maximum of 5 05 and flavobacterium was detected with an increased abundance with a maximum of 4 27 however the altered conditions in later operational stages including aerobic feeding and lower abundance of nitrifying bacteria also affected the denitrifying genera in the industrial lab scale reactor flavobacterium and zoogloea became very abundant at stage 2 21 58 and stage 3 19 73 respectively in both reactors the abundance of almost all polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos e g actinobacterial pao tetrasphaera and rhodocylus related pao dechloromonas decreased during operational stage 1 only rhodocyclus related candidatus accumulibacter was detected in all stages with a maximum abundance of 2 39 in the municipal lab scale sbr with respect to glycogen accumulating organisms gaos the inocula contained mainly defluviicoccus 4 07 industrial propionivibrio 1 07 municipal and candidatus competibacter 5 35 industrial see also fig 9 the abundance of the latter remained high in the industrial lab scale reactor except in stage 3 on the other hand in the municipal lab scale sbr its abundance reached its maximum 13 02 in this last stage 3 4 distribution of selected potential amyloid producers and comparison with thioflavin t staining the identity of amyloid adhesins producers was investigated using fish fig 11 targets were selected based on their high abundance in our system their correlation with a high total relative thioflavin t tht fluorescence intensity and their known eps or amyloid producing capacities although the used probes are not completely genus specific the targeted bacteria will hereafter be referred to as zoogloea probe zra23a and candidatus competibacter gaomix z stack images are represented as maximum intensity projections the channel visualizing the eubmix probe is included as a reference to distinguish unstained regions from voids and to ensure that the organism of interest is detectable by the fish protocol candidatus competibacter occurred in spherical clusters of 9 28 3 79 µm n 9 in diameter in the inoculum from industrial origin similar morphologies were observed in both reactors throughout stage 1 after which the fluorescent signal was more spread out in stages 2 and 3 zoogloea occurred in typical irregular clusters these morphologies and abundances roughly correspond to the results observed earlier for tht staining except for the inoculum from municipal original where a scarce and scattered signal was observed sequential tht staining and fish were performed in selected samples with abundant and distinct tht signals and abundance of the fish target both flash frozen and 4 pfa fixed samples were used for the initial tht staining followed by fixation if needed and fish both approaches led to similar results maximum intensity projections of the sequential results are shown side by side fig 12 as can be observed from the transmission images dehydration and drying steps included in the fish procedure led to a shrinking and distortion of the sludge flocs taking this into account ca competibacter and zoogloea tested often but not always tht positive knowing that the used probes target various subpopulations this could indicate that only selected strains produce detectable amyloids under the applied conditions 4 discussion the focus of this study was to investigate whether the feeding pattern could stimulate or repress amyloid production in a targeted way while considering the compositional evolution of the bacterial community with a focus on amyloid producers additionally in order to improve our understanding of the function of amyloids the results of rigorous monitoring of the distribution of the amyloid positive fraction are discussed as well as the potential link with bioflocculation performance indicators such as floc size and shear sensitivity 4 1 evolution of the thioflavin t detected amyloids versus the feeding conditions the tht fluorescent signal increased quickly both in sludge initially containing a higher amount of amyloids industrial sbr and in sludge initially containing a negligible amount of amyloids municipal sbr and remained high throughout the experiment this implies an increased production of amyloid adhesins an increased abundance of amyloid producers or both several parameters were potentially beneficial for amyloid production in the reactors such as the composition of the wastewater the design of the reactor and the feeding regime as for the composition of the wastewater the carbon source calcium acetate introduces ca2 ions which are known to promote amyloid formation in the context of neurodegenerative disorders botelho et al 2012 itkin et al 2011 in addition the mechanical design of the reactor with effluent removal from the top might also have contributed by selecting for the best settling flocs this contribution is however expected to be minor since no observable biomass was present in the supernatant after the 20 min settling phase moreover later in house experiments with similar inoculum and operational conditions but with a membrane retrofitted to the sbr setup also showed a similar rapid increase of tht fluorescence results not shown the most important and intended impact was the feast famine feeding regime which was hypothesized to improve the production of amyloids in the sludge in general the typical feast famine sbr operation is known to induce good microbial aggregation which relates to strong binding forces gao et al 2011 more specifically the positive effect of starvation on amyloid production has indeed been reported before in mixed bacterial communities in the context of drinking water biofilms and pure culture biofilms gerstel and römling 2001 larsen et al 2007 these feast famine conditions were created in operational stage 1 by feeding once every 6 h and later alleviated in operational stages 2 and 3 by feeding once every 72 and 20 min unexpectedly the tht fluorescence signal remained high when feast famine conditions were alleviated by feeding on a more regular basis not all organic carbon was consumed during the anoxic phase hence in stages 2 and 3 part of the feeding was applied during the aerated reaction phase most likely strongly affecting the microbial community this will be discussed next 4 2 abundance and identity of potential amyloid producers sequencing results were screened for potential amyloid producers by focusing on i highly abundant genera and ii known eps and amyloid producers in the industrial lab scale sbr the abundance of zoogloea coincided with the increase in tht fluorescence observed during the first 62 days of reactor operation zoogloea is a well known eps producer and slime former an et al 2016 characklis 1973 and its production of amyloids has been confirmed in pure and mixed culture via tht staining but not by antibody staining larsen et al 2008 here we confirm tht stained zooglea in a mixed microbial culture note that tht can bind to cellulose fibers which can be produced by zoogloea and other organisms and are associated with flocculent growth retna raj and ramaraj 2001 friedman et al 1968 deinema and zevenhuizen 1971 if the tht staining near zoogloea stems from interactions with cellulose instead of amyloids then this signal might still imply a role in bioflocculation for zoogloea through its cellulose fibrils zooglea belongs to the family rhodocyclaceae in which also other eps producing denitrifiers are also classified including thauera shinoda et al 2004 szabó et al 2017 thauera is in this experiment mainly detected during the first operational stage in both industrial and municipal lab scale sbr thauera s amyloid producing properties in activated sludge have been confirmed before via tht staining larsen et al 2008 during later operational stages the eps producing denitrifier flavobacterium of the family flavobacteriaceae was very abundant in the industrial lab scale reactor as also indicated by li et al 2014 furthermore actinobacterial paos have been identified as potential amyloid producers via tht staining larsen et al 2008 the genera tetrasphaera and dechloromonas were detected in the first stage of reactor operation in the municipal lab scale sbr but their abundance did not coincide with the observed tht fluorescence in later stages decreasing or high but gone after the first operational stage respectively given that the synthetic wastewater did not contain much phosphate it is logical that paos were not functionally promoted in later operational stages with aerobic feeding the bacterial community in the industrial lab scale sbr was mainly dominated by zoogloea and flavobacterium both fast growing heterotrophs that can use o2 or no3 as terminal electron acceptors rosenberg et al 2014 the nitrifiers on the other hand were washed out once the feast famine conditions were alleviated most probably they lost the competition for oxygen against the fast growing heterotrophs when organic carbon was still available during the aerated phase in contrast fewer zoogloea and flavobacterium were detected in the municipal lab scale sbr but there the abundance of the glycogen accumulating candidatus competibacter steadily increased genomic analyses indicated the potential for full denitrification in a member from this genus mcilroy et al 2014 similarly weissbrodt et al 2013 noticed that zoogloea were never abundant in the biomass of their gao sbr nevertheless populations with a dominance of either zoogloea or candidatus competibacter both showcased good flocculation performance up to aerobic granules formation the sequential tht staining and fish procedure in our study seems indeed to imply the possibility of amyloid production by candidatus competibacter in contrast research performed on full scale wwtp samples reported no binding of antibody or tht to the gaomix or general gammaproteobacteria probe defined group larsen et al 2008 this might indicate that some micro organisms only express amyloids under certain conditions in any case validation of results via e g staining with antibodies is advised in other research fields glycogen has been reported to accelerate fibril formation in the hen egg white lysozyme model system holubová et al 2021 in the domain of wastewater treatment it is known that colonies of gammaproteobacteria to which candidatus competibacter are related are very resistant to shear implying strong cell to cell interactions in the microcolonies klausen et al 2004 this result could be related to the presence of eps components such as amyloids also supported by the observation that the removal of ca2 ions leads to the weakening of these interactions however klausen et al additionally reported the low dependency on hydrophobic interactions in gammaproteobacterial aggregates which does not support the above statement finally dominiak et al 2011 reported candidatus competibacter being consistently surrounded by edna inferring that this edna might enhance the strength of its microcolonies it should be noted that dna is a molecule with a repeating structure with a possibility of unspecific binding by tht ilanchelian and ramaraj 2004 again checking the current results with other dyes is recommended finally it was observed that some of the above mentioned potential amyloid producers were already present in the inoculum from municipal origin when almost no amyloids were detected fluorescently this was the case for some actinobacterial paos dechloromonas 4 80 tetrasphaera 3 85 and zoogloea 3 54 this lack of amyloid signal might be explained by the absence of the growth conditions triggering the expression of amyloid adhesins in the full scale wwtp of origin this again highlights the importance of understanding these conditions 4 3 distribution and location of the thioflavin t positive fraction a diversity of tht positive areas have been observed throughout all stages of this study potentially indicating the diverse functions of amyloid interactions in activated sludge flocs firstly tht fluorescence was observed as distinct clusters indicating the presence of amyloids within microcolonies of certain organisms this distinct localization occurred mainly in the industrial lab scale sbr and during the first stage of reactor operation larsen et al similarly observed amyloids mostly in microcolonies using tht and wo1 and wo2 conformational antibodies in case of non filamentous bacteria and in full scale samples amyloids can hence potentially improve internal adhesion within microcolonies larsen et al 2008 secondly tht fluorescence was observed dispersed throughout the bacterial floc this dispersed appearance occurred mainly in the municipal reactor and during the later stages of reactor operation potentially as a result of scattering of the amyloid producers throughout the floc or a wider variety of micro organisms being able to produce amyloids in the applied cultivation conditions this disperse presence of adhesins might help bio aggregation by increasing the hydrophobicity of the overall floc larsen et al 2008 aqeel et al 2021 and brei et al 2011 also reported this scattered presence of amyloids via immunohistochemical detection with antibodies against csga and csgb curli proteins in sludge samples from lab scale fixed film sbr and a full scale communal wwtp respectively it was however not possible to confirm their observation that curli amyloids were more abundant near the core of the granule or floc respectively since no reference staining targeting all biomass was included in these papers thirdly amyloids were present on filamentous bacteria which has been observed before by means of tht or wo1 antibody staining conco et al 2018 larsen et al 2008 it is hypothesized that amyloids might also positively affect the floc strength via strengthening the sheaths of these filamentous bacteria that are important as floc backbone larsen et al 2008 but no further research has been performed thus far on the identification of these filamentous amyloid producing bacteria 4 4 effect of abundance morphology and location of tht positive fraction on bioflocculation in the industrial lab scale sbr the presence of amyloids in distinct clusters corresponded to a high average floc size while a disperse morphology corresponded to a lower average floc size this might be explained by the adhesion mechanisms induced by the amyloid adhesins when amyloids occur in tightly packed dense clusters both hydrophobic interactions as well as physical entanglement can take place and contribute to the total adhesion strength this provides tightly bound building blocks on the contrary when amyloids occur more disperse physical protein to protein interactions are less prominent and the adhesion strength is mainly a result of the hydrophobic interactions these changing interactions are not reflected however in the floc shear sensitivity data note that even in our adjusted protocol the shear sensitivity measurement is still prone to a large variability and that it reflects the amount of sheared off primary particles and does not give information about the strength of the sludge floc as a whole additionally the potential impact of other eps components and corresponding interactions whose evolution has not been monitored throughout the experiment should be acknowledged 4 5 comments on the applied procedures relative quantification of thioflavin t fluorescence quantification of the tht signal is typically performed in monoprotein experiments i e to monitor fibrillation of protein solutions levine 1999 morel et al 2010 or decay of amyloids fibrils morales belpaire and gerin 2008 and rarely in biofilms of pure cultures of micro organisms randrianjatovo gbalou et al 2017 the intensity of bound tht is known to vary with i environmental conditions e g temperature solvent ii the total applied tht concentration and iii the nature and concentration of proteins amdursky et al 2012 xue et al 2017 the proposed protocol avoids some of these variations e g by fixing the applied tht concentration at 3 µm and the biomass content at 1 g mlss l 1 still the amyloid protein dependent tht intensity will always inherently affect the signal since activated sludge is a mixed and evolving community of bacteria therefore the reported quantity of tht fluorescence should not be directly linked to amyloid concentration rather it gives an impression of trends in the amyloid production unspecific binding of thioflavin t when detecting amyloids using the conformational dye thioflavin t in complex biological samples one should be aware that unspecific binding to interfering components such as cellulose mentioned before in the context of zoogloea and extracellular dna might contribute to the signal ilanchelian and ramaraj 2004 retna raj and ramaraj 2001 it should be noted that the authors did not observe the latter interference verified by experiments combining the cell impermeable nucleic acid stain propidium iodide and thioflavin t a thorough microscopic investigation at several timepoints e g detecting cellulose fibers in municipal inoculum might help to critically assess qualitative and quantitative results sequential detection method when using tht to stain amyloids the sequential method is needed since the tht signal cannot be detected after fish this might be due to formic acid denaturation of proteins during the hybridization step christensen et al 2020 fresh samples lead to the highest observable tht signal but both fixed and flash frozen samples have been used successfully in this work for those cases the tht signal was much weaker potentially due to partial crosslinking of the targets or damage from ice crystals although amyloids are stable upon freezing e g schoonenboom et al 2005 reported no lower relative concentration of amyloid β 1 42 protein after one freeze thaw cycle 4 6 future research identification of amyloid producers in mixed culture via fish first applied by larsen et al 2007 is a powerful method as most bacteria in environmental samples remain uncultured larsen et al 2008 however the method is partly based on trial and error investigating a few potential amyloid producers at a time to have complementary information ongoing research focuses on proteome characterization such as also performed by silva et al 2012 successful implementation of this method requires a complete extraction of the tightly bound eps and overcoming interferences by other matrix components to screen the conditions that trigger amyloid production relevant amyloid producing wastewater treatment related organisms could be studied in controllable aggregation formats such as biofilms this approach has been implemented before with salmonella pseudomonas and escherichia model organisms gerstel and römling 2001 maurer et al 1998 prigent combaret et al 2001 scharfman et al 1996 conclusions from this biofilm format could help to understand observations in flocs or granules since biological aggregation can be considered a continuum aqeel et al 2019 to still mimic the complex interactions and dynamics within mixed communities co cultures that encompass several functional strains e g nitrifiers and denitrifiers can be envisaged 5 conclusion in this experimental study the effect of various feeding regimes on amyloids and potential amyloid producers in activated sludge was rigorously monitored over 183 days to this end the fluorescent dye thioflavin t was used qualitatively and quantitatively the abundance of detectable amyloids was enhanced in sbrs fed with synthetic wastewater and this in sludges containing a negligible or already substantial amount of amyloids upon inoculation the feeding regime impacted the distribution of produced amyloids feast famine conditions resulted in dense clusters while nearly continuous feeding resulted in dispersion of the detected amyloids the initial hypothesis that a more continuous feeding phase would negatively impact the sludge bioflocculation was not confirmed while the average floc size did decrease towards the nearly continuous feeding phase for the industrial sbr the floc size remained the same for the municipal sludge throughout the experiment with also no clear impact on the shear sensitivity of the sludges however the feeding regime clearly impacted the bacterial community more continuous and thereby partly aerobic feeding resulted in a dominance of denitrifiers owing to their ability to exploit oxygen as electron acceptor when there is still organic carbon present this included the potential amyloid producer zoogloea in the industrial lab scale reactor furthermore the glycogen accumulating candidatus competibacter were or became dominant in both reactors this research is the first to identify candidatus competibacter as a potential amyloid producer based on sequential thioflavin t staining and fish these results highlight the importance of the interplay between the presence of growth conditions triggering amyloid production and varying bacterial

19920,amyloid adhesins are β sheet rich extracellular proteins thought to contribute to bioflocculation they are present in activated sludge to varying extent however it remains unclear which operational conditions promote their production to this end the abundance and distribution of amyloids and their potential producers were monitored in two lab scale reactors operated in sequencing batch mode with an unaerated and aerated reaction phase various feeding regimes ranging from feast famine to nearly continuous feeding were applied thioflavin t staining revealed more amyloids in the lab scale reactors during all operational stages compared to the full scale industrial and municipal inocula furthermore the feeding regime impacted the distribution of produced amyloids from dense clusters during feast famine conditions towards a dispersed distribution during nearly continuous feeding this dispersed presence did not negatively impact the bioflocculation towards average floc size and shear sensitivity 16s rrna sequencing detected several known eps and amyloid producers more continuous and hence partially aerobic feeding promoted the relative abundance of denitrifiers sequential thioflavin t staining and fluorescence in situ hybridization identified zoogloea and ca competibacter as potential amyloid producers under the applied conditions this experiment confirms that amyloid producers need to be triggered for production and that the feeding regime impacts the microbial community composition which in turn influences the amyloid production and distribution graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biological wastewater treatment bioflocculation extracellular polymeric substances thioflavin t clsm microbial community data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the performance and cost efficiency of biological wastewater treatment systems highly depend on the ability of the activated sludge bacteria to form large and dense flocs such that an efficient sludge water separation can be ensured a crucial element for the structural integrity of these flocs is the matrix of extracellular polymeric substances eps in which the activated sludge bacteria are embedded suresh et al 2018 in the proteinaceous fraction of the eps various adhesins exist that are distinguished by their structure and specific mechanism of cell to cell interaction e g flagella pili lectins and amyloid adhesins these latter structures are β sheet rich and highly organized proteins that are insoluble and resistant to many chemical and mechanical denaturants and protease activity christensen et al 2020 epstein and chapman 2008 most of the information about the role of bacterial amyloids in bio aggregation is inferred from pure culture biofilm studies of bacteria that have limited relevance in wastewater treatment e g e coli pseudomonas and bacillus subtillis aqeel et al 2019 amyloids improve the adherence properties and mechanical robustness of these biofilms inspired by these results from the domain of pure cultures amyloid adhesins are thought to contribute to the high stability of the strongly bound fraction of cells and eps in activated sludge flocs larsen et al 2008 yet this hypothesis has not been investigated thoroughly to the best of the authors knowledge nonetheless amyloids have been detected in activated sludge systems in biofilms flocs and aerobic granules dueholm and nielsen 2016 lin et al 2018 aqeel et al 2021 pure culture studies on model organisms have revealed some conditions in which amyloid production is enhanced such as low temperature low oxygen content low osmolarity and nutrient limitation e g fe3 limitation for pseudomonas gerstel and römling 2001 maurer et al 1998 prigent combaret et al 2001 scharfman et al 1996 however these observations are often organism dependent or the applied conditions may not be possible or may be less appropriate to implement within the context of wastewater treatment if amyloid adhesins can be linked to strong bioflocculation and if their production can be promoted by certain operational conditions we have a powerful tool to optimize the sludge water separation part of activated sludge systems this work therefore i investigated the possibility of stimulating amyloid adhesin production in an activated sludge community by changing the feeding pattern in a sequencing batch reactor sbr setup while ii screening the activated sludge bacterial community for the corresponding amyloid producers the original research hypothesis was that a more continuous feeding would induce a decrease in adhesin production and a concomitant deterioration of the bioflocculation the latter is monitored through floc size and strength 2 materials and methods 2 1 parallel sequencing batch reactor set up and operation the reactors consisted of 4 l glass cylindrical vessels stirred using a magnetic stirring

thioflavin t tht has long been the gold standard to detect protein misfolding in the medical field and has also been used to detect functional amyloids in bacteria this dye is characterized by a large increase in fluorescence upon binding to amyloids biancalana and koide 2010 more recently antibodies have also been used for amyloid detection e g conformational antibodies wo1 and wo2 and antibodies against csga and csgb curli proteins expressed in e coli brei 2011 chapman et al 2002 o nuallain and wetzel 2002 in this work the thioflavin t tht dye was used to detect amyloid adhesins in the activated sludge sample as it is commercially available unlike the mentioned conformational antibodies and will bind to diverse amyloid structures in various organisms unlike the sequence specific antibodies tht powder thermo fisher scientific was dissolved in milli q water and filtered through a 0 2 µm syringe filter the concentration of the stock solution was determined spectrophotometrically by absorbance measurement at 412 nm from this the concentration was calculated via the lambert beer law with the molar extinction coefficient equal to 36 000 m 1 cm 1 for thioflavin t in water de ferrari et al 2001 to perform the staining fresh samples were diluted to 1 g mlss l 1 tht was added to a final concentration of 3 µm and incubated 15 min room temperature the tht fluorescence signal was visualized using an olympus fluo view fv1000 confocal microscope equipped with 440 nm laser 405 458 nm dichroic mirror and 480 495 nm barrier filter laser intensity percentage and detector voltage were chosen such that all observable autofluorescence on an unstained sample was minimized the transmission signal was collected as a reference image processing was performed in fiji schindelin et al 2012 the color intensity of the images was slightly adjusted for improved resolution the tht fluorescence signal was quantified in a 96 well plate art no 655090 greiner bio one international gmbh kremsmünster austria in four technical replicates using a tecan infinite m200 pro microplate reader with i control 1 9 software an emission scan was performed from 440 to 650 nm with a 10 nm stepsize

modifications briefly 700 ml of 3 5 g mlss l 1 sludge was sheared for up to 300 min in a baffled reactor at a constant shear intensity g 800 s 1 the turbidity of the supernatant was measured every 30

al 2013 graphs were generated using ms excel 2 5 fluorescence in situ hybridization and identification of amyloid producers via a sequential procedure fluorescence in situ hybridization fish was performed as described by amann 1995 using the probes described below for direct identification of amyloid producers an optimized protocol of sequential tht staining and fish is proposed based on larsen et al 2007 first activated sludge was stained with tht followed by an initial localization and recording of several flocs on a glass coverslip after that the sample was dried on the coverslip and if still needed fixed for 2 h with 4 paraformaldehyde pfa for fixation of gram negative cells the dehydration and hybridization were performed as described by amann 1995 finally the same flocs were localized again and recorded to avoid biomass wash off during this procedure glass cover slips were pretreated by rinsing with 70 ethanol for degreasing followed by dipping into 0 5 w v gelatin and 0 01 crk so4 2 at 70 c to improve adhesion nielsen et al 2009 to facilitate floc localization coverslips with a 500 µm grid ibidi were used the identity of some bacteria in sludge samples was investigated using the following oligonucleotide probes zra23a targeting members of the zoogloea lineage except z resiniphila rosselló mora et al 1995 gaomix equimolar mixture of gb g1 and gb g2 for several ca competibacter crocetti et al 2002 kong et al 2002 and eubmix equimolar mixture of eub 338 eub338 ii and eub338 iii targeting most bacteria amann et al 1990 daims et al 1999 details are summarized in probebase loy et al 2007 probes were double labeled at the 5 and 3 end with the same fluorophore either 6 carboxyfluorescein 6 fam or the sulfoindocyanine dye cy3 all probes were purchased from biomers germany the fluorescence signal was visualized on an olympus fluoview fv1000 confocal microscope with a 488 nm laser and 505 540 nm barrier filter for 6 fam and a 559 nm laser and 575 620 nm barrier filter for cy3 multi channel datasets were recorded in sequential mode to avoid crosstalk 3 results results for the reactors inoculated with sludge from industrial and municipal origin are hereafter referred to as the industrial and municipal lab scale sbr 3 1 evolution of amyloids detected with thioflavin t samples subjected to different feeding conditions were characterized using 3 µm tht targeting most amyloid adhesins visual detection based on microscopic images as well as quantification of the emission signal is performed as for the visual detection z stack images were studied in 3 d but are represented here in 2 d as maximum intensity projections with the transmission image included as a structural reference to distinguish unstained regions from voids fig 3 in dense flocs such as present in the industrial sbr at the end of the first operational stage the light penetration was limited to a depth of around 25 µm which should be considered when interpreting the clsm results tht positive areas were abundant in the inoculum originating from the industrial wastewater treatment plant wwtp and detected as characteristic spherical clusters with a diameter of 11 16 4 19 µm n 6 in comparison tht positive areas were scattered and less abundant in the inoculum originating from the municipal plant a qualitative increase in tht positive areas was observed in both reactors during the first operational stage in later stages characterized by more frequent feeding the tht signal appeared less clustered and more evenly spread throughout the sludge floc tht also stained elongated structures representing filamentous bacteria or epiphytic attachments the spatial arrangement of the fluorescent signal in the floc was further studied from the 3 d reconstructions in depth coding mode with the 16 colors color scale fig 4 single optical sections are overlapped after attributing one color to each of them colors range from white to black corresponding to the lowest slice i e closest to the objective and highest slice i e furthest away from the objective respectively this representation preserves some depth information in a 2 d image the emission signal mostly appears to be present throughout the entire floc depth additionally the tht emission signal of sludge suspensions was quantified at the excitation maximum of 490 nm results are corrected for sample autofluorescence and reported in fig 5 a similar trend was observed for both reactors after inoculation the fluorescence intensity steadily increased until an equilibrium was achieved at the end of stage 1 after a delay the signal then increased further in the later stages characterized by more frequent and hence aerobic feeding 3 2 bioflocculation performance the largest average floc size was observed in the industrial lab scale reactor while subjected to feast famine conditions fig 6 afterwards the average floc size decreased gradually and remained stable during the third operational stage no strong trends were observed in the municipal lab scale sbr but the average floc size was generally the lowest when subjected to nearly continuous feeding stage 3 sensitivity to turbulent shear was relatively low for both reactors throughout the experiment with fluctuating values fig 7 the lowest values for k s s were measured near the end of the first operational stage day 30 and 44 for industrial and municipal lab scale reactor respectively 3 3 reactor performance and community dynamics the activated sludge community dynamics is first described on the family level to then zoom in on the genus level which is finally correlated to the reactor performance by including an anoxic phase the sbrs were expected to have a high nitrogen removal on top of the conventional organic carbon cod removal under aerobic conditions autotrophic nitrifiers can oxidize nh4 to no3 which under anoxic conditions heterotrophic denitrifiers can reduce to n2 however while a cod removal of at least 98 1 industrial sbr and 95 8 municipal sbr was achieved the nitrogen removal was impaired after stage 1 as discussed below on average 65 716 58 reads per sample n 12 samples were obtained from illumina miseq reads with a frequency lower than 18 were removed this cut off equals 0 05 percent of the average read abundance after dada2 denoising at the family level top part of fig 8 rhodocyclaceae were detected in all stages but became more abundant in the industrial lab scale sbr during stages 2 and 3 of reactor operation with a 35 46 and 26 53 relative read abundance respectively at these time points also the flavobacteriaceae were abundant with 21 58 and 8 58 in the industrial lab scale sbr in the municipal lab scale sbr the family competibacter became more abundant in stage 3 at the genus level bottom part of fig 8 the results are summarized here in functional groups the abundance of ammonium and nitrite oxidizing genera decreased for both reactors throughout the reactor run these microbial community dynamics were reflected in an increase of nh4 and a decrease of no3 in stage 3 fig 10 regarding denitrifying bacteria during stage 1 rhodocyclaceae related zoogloea were abundant in the industrial lab scale sbr increase to 10 74 and in the municipal lab scale sbr maximum of 5 78 see also fig 9 the abundance of rhodocyclaceae related thauera increased to 4 80 and 3 31 for the industrial and municipal lab scale sbr respectively in the municipal lab scale reactor the abundance of dechloromonas remained high with a maximum of 5 05 and flavobacterium was detected with an increased abundance with a maximum of 4 27 however the altered conditions in later operational stages including aerobic feeding and lower abundance of nitrifying bacteria also affected the denitrifying genera in the industrial lab scale reactor flavobacterium and zoogloea became very abundant at stage 2 21 58 and stage 3 19 73 respectively in both reactors the abundance of almost all polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos e g actinobacterial pao tetrasphaera and rhodocylus related pao dechloromonas decreased during operational stage 1 only rhodocyclus related candidatus accumulibacter was detected in all stages with a maximum abundance of 2 39 in the municipal lab scale sbr with respect to glycogen accumulating organisms gaos the inocula contained mainly defluviicoccus 4 07 industrial propionivibrio 1 07 municipal and candidatus competibacter 5 35 industrial see also fig 9 the abundance of the latter remained high in the industrial lab scale reactor except in stage 3 on the other hand in the municipal lab scale sbr its abundance reached its maximum 13 02 in this last stage 3 4 distribution of selected potential amyloid producers and comparison with thioflavin t staining the identity of amyloid adhesins producers was investigated using fish fig 11 targets were selected based on their high abundance in our system their correlation with a high total relative thioflavin t tht fluorescence intensity and their known eps or amyloid producing capacities although the used probes are not completely genus specific the targeted bacteria will hereafter be referred to as zoogloea probe zra23a and candidatus competibacter gaomix z stack images are represented as maximum intensity projections the channel visualizing the eubmix probe is included as a reference to distinguish unstained regions from voids and to ensure that the organism of interest is detectable by the fish protocol candidatus competibacter occurred in spherical clusters of 9 28 3 79 µm n 9 in diameter in the inoculum from industrial origin similar morphologies were observed in both reactors throughout stage 1 after which the fluorescent signal was more spread out in stages 2 and 3 zoogloea occurred in typical irregular clusters these morphologies and abundances roughly correspond to the results observed earlier for tht staining except for the inoculum from municipal original where a scarce and scattered signal was observed sequential tht staining and fish were performed in selected samples with abundant and distinct tht signals and abundance of the fish target both flash frozen and 4 pfa fixed samples were used for the initial tht staining followed by fixation if needed and fish both approaches led to similar results maximum intensity projections of the sequential results are shown side by side fig 12 as can be observed from the transmission images dehydration and drying steps included in the fish procedure led to a shrinking and distortion of the sludge flocs taking this into account ca competibacter and zoogloea tested often but not always tht positive knowing that the used probes target various subpopulations this could indicate that only selected strains produce detectable amyloids under the applied conditions 4 discussion the focus of this study was to investigate whether the feeding pattern could stimulate or repress amyloid production in a targeted way while considering the compositional evolution of the bacterial community with a focus on amyloid producers additionally in order to improve our understanding of the function of amyloids the results of rigorous monitoring of the distribution of the amyloid positive fraction are discussed as well as the potential link with bioflocculation performance indicators such as floc size and shear sensitivity 4 1 evolution of the thioflavin t detected amyloids versus the feeding conditions the tht fluorescent signal increased quickly both in sludge initially containing a higher amount of amyloids industrial sbr and in sludge initially containing a negligible amount of amyloids municipal sbr and remained high throughout the experiment this implies an increased production of amyloid adhesins an increased abundance of amyloid producers or both several parameters were potentially beneficial for amyloid production in the reactors such as the composition of the wastewater the design of the reactor and the feeding regime as for the composition of the wastewater the carbon source calcium acetate introduces ca2 ions which are known to promote amyloid formation in the context of neurodegenerative disorders botelho et al 2012 itkin et al 2011 in addition the mechanical design of the reactor with effluent removal from the top might also have contributed by selecting for the best settling flocs this contribution is however expected to be minor since no observable biomass was present in the supernatant after the 20 min settling phase moreover later in house experiments with similar inoculum and operational conditions but with a membrane retrofitted to the sbr setup also showed a similar rapid increase of tht fluorescence results not shown the most important and intended impact was the feast famine feeding regime which was hypothesized to improve the production of amyloids in the sludge in general the typical feast famine sbr operation is known to induce good microbial aggregation which relates to strong binding forces gao et al 2011 more specifically the positive effect of starvation on amyloid production has indeed been reported before in mixed bacterial communities in the context of drinking water biofilms and pure culture biofilms gerstel and römling 2001 larsen et al 2007 these feast famine conditions were created in operational stage 1 by feeding once every 6 h and later alleviated in operational stages 2 and 3 by feeding once every 72 and 20 min unexpectedly the tht fluorescence signal remained high when feast famine conditions were alleviated by feeding on a more regular basis not all organic carbon was consumed during the anoxic phase hence in stages 2 and 3 part of the feeding was applied during the aerated reaction phase most likely strongly affecting the microbial community this will be discussed next 4 2 abundance and identity of potential amyloid producers sequencing results were screened for potential amyloid producers by focusing on i highly abundant genera and ii known eps and amyloid producers in the industrial lab scale sbr the abundance of zoogloea coincided with the increase in tht fluorescence observed during the first 62 days of reactor operation zoogloea is a well known eps producer and slime former an et al 2016 characklis 1973 and its production of amyloids has been confirmed in pure and mixed culture via tht staining but not by antibody staining larsen et al 2008 here we confirm tht stained zooglea in a mixed microbial culture note that tht can bind to cellulose fibers which can be produced by zoogloea and other organisms and are associated with flocculent growth retna raj and ramaraj 2001 friedman et al 1968 deinema and zevenhuizen 1971 if the tht staining near zoogloea stems from interactions with cellulose instead of amyloids then this signal might still imply a role in bioflocculation for zoogloea through its cellulose fibrils zooglea belongs to the family rhodocyclaceae in which also other eps producing denitrifiers are also classified including thauera shinoda et al 2004 szabó et al 2017 thauera is in this experiment mainly detected during the first operational stage in both industrial and municipal lab scale sbr thauera s amyloid producing properties in activated sludge have been confirmed before via tht staining larsen et al 2008 during later operational stages the eps producing denitrifier flavobacterium of the family flavobacteriaceae was very abundant in the industrial lab scale reactor as also indicated by li et al 2014 furthermore actinobacterial paos have been identified as potential amyloid producers via tht staining larsen et al 2008 the genera tetrasphaera and dechloromonas were detected in the first stage of reactor operation in the municipal lab scale sbr but their abundance did not coincide with the observed tht fluorescence in later stages decreasing or high but gone after the first operational stage respectively given that the synthetic wastewater did not contain much phosphate it is logical that paos were not functionally promoted in later operational stages with aerobic feeding the bacterial community in the industrial lab scale sbr was mainly dominated by zoogloea and flavobacterium both fast growing heterotrophs that can use o2 or no3 as terminal electron acceptors rosenberg et al 2014 the nitrifiers on the other hand were washed out once the feast famine conditions were alleviated most probably they lost the competition for oxygen against the fast growing heterotrophs when organic carbon was still available during the aerated phase in contrast fewer zoogloea and flavobacterium were detected in the municipal lab scale sbr but there the abundance of the glycogen accumulating candidatus competibacter steadily increased genomic analyses indicated the potential for full denitrification in a member from this genus mcilroy et al 2014 similarly weissbrodt et al 2013 noticed that zoogloea were never abundant in the biomass of their gao sbr nevertheless populations with a dominance of either zoogloea or candidatus competibacter both showcased good flocculation performance up to aerobic granules formation the sequential tht staining and fish procedure in our study seems indeed to imply the possibility of amyloid production by candidatus competibacter in contrast research performed on full scale wwtp samples reported no binding of antibody or tht to the gaomix or general gammaproteobacteria probe defined group larsen et al 2008 this might indicate that some micro organisms only express amyloids under certain conditions in any case validation of results via e g staining with antibodies is advised in other research fields glycogen has been reported to accelerate fibril formation in the hen egg white lysozyme model system holubová et al 2021 in the domain of wastewater treatment it is known that colonies of gammaproteobacteria to which candidatus competibacter are related are very resistant to shear implying strong cell to cell interactions in the microcolonies klausen et al 2004 this result could be related to the presence of eps components such as amyloids also supported by the observation that the removal of ca2 ions leads to the weakening of these interactions however klausen et al additionally reported the low dependency on hydrophobic interactions in gammaproteobacterial aggregates which does not support the above statement finally dominiak et al 2011 reported candidatus competibacter being consistently surrounded by edna inferring that this edna might enhance the strength of its microcolonies it should be noted that dna is a molecule with a repeating structure with a possibility of unspecific binding by tht ilanchelian and ramaraj 2004 again checking the current results with other dyes is recommended finally it was observed that some of the above mentioned potential amyloid producers were already present in the inoculum from municipal origin when almost no amyloids were detected fluorescently this was the case for some actinobacterial paos dechloromonas 4 80 tetrasphaera 3 85 and zoogloea 3 54 this lack of amyloid signal might be explained by the absence of the growth conditions triggering the expression of amyloid adhesins in the full scale wwtp of origin this again highlights the importance of understanding these conditions 4 3 distribution and location of the thioflavin t positive fraction a diversity of tht positive areas have been observed throughout all stages of this study potentially indicating the diverse functions of amyloid interactions in activated sludge flocs firstly tht fluorescence was observed as distinct clusters indicating the presence of amyloids within microcolonies of certain organisms this distinct localization occurred mainly in the industrial lab scale sbr and during the first stage of reactor operation larsen et al similarly observed amyloids mostly in microcolonies using tht and wo1 and wo2 conformational antibodies in case of non filamentous bacteria and in full scale samples amyloids can hence potentially improve internal adhesion within microcolonies larsen et al 2008 secondly tht fluorescence was observed dispersed throughout the bacterial floc this dispersed appearance occurred mainly in the municipal reactor and during the later stages of reactor operation potentially as a result of scattering of the amyloid producers throughout the floc or a wider variety of micro organisms being able to produce amyloids in the applied cultivation conditions this disperse presence of adhesins might help bio aggregation by increasing the hydrophobicity of the overall floc larsen et al 2008 aqeel et al 2021 and brei et al 2011 also reported this scattered presence of amyloids via immunohistochemical detection with antibodies against csga and csgb curli proteins in sludge samples from lab scale fixed film sbr and a full scale communal wwtp respectively it was however not possible to confirm their observation that curli amyloids were more abundant near the core of the granule or floc respectively since no reference staining targeting all biomass was included in these papers thirdly amyloids were present on filamentous bacteria which has been observed before by means of tht or wo1 antibody staining conco et al 2018 larsen et al 2008 it is hypothesized that amyloids might also positively affect the floc strength via strengthening the sheaths of these filamentous bacteria that are important as floc backbone larsen et al 2008 but no further research has been performed thus far on the identification of these filamentous amyloid producing bacteria 4 4 effect of abundance morphology and location of tht positive fraction on bioflocculation in the industrial lab scale sbr the presence of amyloids in distinct clusters corresponded to a high average floc size while a disperse morphology corresponded to a lower average floc size this might be explained by the adhesion mechanisms induced by the amyloid adhesins when amyloids occur in tightly packed dense clusters both hydrophobic interactions as well as physical entanglement can take place and contribute to the total adhesion strength this provides tightly bound building blocks on the contrary when amyloids occur more disperse physical protein to protein interactions are less prominent and the adhesion strength is mainly a result of the hydrophobic interactions these changing interactions are not reflected however in the floc shear sensitivity data note that even in our adjusted protocol the shear sensitivity measurement is still prone to a large variability and that it reflects the amount of sheared off primary particles and does not give information about the strength of the sludge floc as a whole additionally the potential impact of other eps components and corresponding interactions whose evolution has not been monitored throughout the experiment should be acknowledged 4 5 comments on the applied procedures relative quantification of thioflavin t fluorescence quantification of the tht signal is typically performed in monoprotein experiments i e to monitor fibrillation of protein solutions levine 1999 morel et al 2010 or decay of amyloids fibrils morales belpaire and gerin 2008 and rarely in biofilms of pure cultures of micro organisms randrianjatovo gbalou et al 2017 the intensity of bound tht is known to vary with i environmental conditions e g temperature solvent ii the total applied tht concentration and iii the nature and concentration of proteins amdursky et al 2012 xue et al 2017 the proposed protocol avoids some of these variations e g by fixing the applied tht concentration at 3 µm and the biomass content at 1 g mlss l 1 still the amyloid protein dependent tht intensity will always inherently affect the signal since activated sludge is a mixed and evolving community of bacteria therefore the reported quantity of tht fluorescence should not be directly linked to amyloid concentration rather it gives an impression of trends in the amyloid production unspecific binding of thioflavin t when detecting amyloids using the conformational dye thioflavin t in complex biological samples one should be aware that unspecific binding to interfering components such as cellulose mentioned before in the context of zoogloea and extracellular dna might contribute to the signal ilanchelian and ramaraj 2004 retna raj and ramaraj 2001 it should be noted that the authors did not observe the latter interference verified by experiments combining the cell impermeable nucleic acid stain propidium iodide and thioflavin t a thorough microscopic investigation at several timepoints e g detecting cellulose fibers in municipal inoculum might help to critically assess qualitative and quantitative results sequential detection method when using tht to stain amyloids the sequential method is needed since the tht signal cannot be detected after fish this might be due to formic acid denaturation of proteins during the hybridization step christensen et al 2020 fresh samples lead to the highest observable tht signal but both fixed and flash frozen samples have been used successfully in this work for those cases the tht signal was much weaker potentially due to partial crosslinking of the targets or damage from ice crystals although amyloids are stable upon freezing e g schoonenboom et al 2005 reported no lower relative concentration of amyloid β 1 42 protein after one freeze thaw cycle 4 6 future research identification of amyloid producers in mixed culture via fish first applied by larsen et al 2007 is a powerful method as most bacteria in environmental samples remain uncultured larsen et al 2008 however the method is partly based on trial and error investigating a few potential amyloid producers at a time to have complementary information ongoing research focuses on proteome characterization such as also performed by silva et al 2012 successful implementation of this method requires a complete extraction of the tightly bound eps and overcoming interferences by other matrix components to screen the conditions that trigger amyloid production relevant amyloid producing wastewater treatment related organisms could be studied in controllable aggregation formats such as biofilms this approach has been implemented before with salmonella pseudomonas and escherichia model organisms gerstel and römling 2001 maurer et al 1998 prigent combaret et al 2001 scharfman et al 1996 conclusions from this biofilm format could help to understand observations in flocs or granules since biological aggregation can be considered a continuum aqeel et al 2019 to still mimic the complex interactions and dynamics within mixed communities co cultures that encompass several functional strains e g nitrifiers and denitrifiers can be envisaged 5 conclusion in this experimental study the effect of various feeding regimes on amyloids and potential amyloid producers in activated sludge was rigorously monitored over 183 days to this end the fluorescent dye thioflavin t was used qualitatively and quantitatively the abundance of detectable amyloids was enhanced in sbrs fed with synthetic wastewater and this in sludges containing a negligible or already substantial amount of amyloids upon inoculation the feeding regime impacted the distribution of produced amyloids feast famine conditions resulted in dense clusters while nearly continuous feeding resulted in dispersion of the detected amyloids the initial hypothesis that a more continuous feeding phase would negatively impact the sludge bioflocculation was not confirmed while the average floc size did decrease towards the nearly continuous feeding phase for the industrial sbr the floc size remained the same for the municipal sludge throughout the experiment with also no clear impact on the shear sensitivity of the sludges however the feeding regime clearly impacted the bacterial community more continuous and thereby partly aerobic feeding resulted in a dominance of denitrifiers owing to their ability to exploit oxygen as electron acceptor when there is still organic carbon present this included the potential amyloid producer zoogloea in the industrial lab scale reactor furthermore the glycogen accumulating candidatus competibacter were or became dominant in both reactors this research is the first to identify candidatus competibacter as a potential amyloid producer based on sequential thioflavin t staining and fish these results highlight the importance of the interplay between the presence of growth conditions triggering amyloid production and varying bacterial communities in which amyloid producers can become dominant declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

19921,trust is generally considered to play a key enabling role in water governance despite this notion there have been no systematic assessments examining the way in which the literature on water governance engages with trust our article fills this gap by providing an overview of the way in which this literature has engaged with trust as a conceptual lens analytical device and empirical phenomenon through an explorative systematic literature review of n 200 mainly peer reviewed journal articles our findings reveal that the knowledge base on the role of trust in water governance is fragmented poorly conceptualized and contextually dispersed we also observe that the role of trust is often understudied especially in the context of the global south and with regard to ethnic minorities and indigenous people as the subjects of trust we recommend that future research should build on solid empirical evidence diversify its foci go beyond an instrumental approach to trust and rely on clear and transparent conceptualizations that acknowledge the context specific and dynamic nature of trust relationships the results of this review should serve to better systemize future research and to further the understanding on the role s of trust in varying contexts and related to different water governance issues graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords trust in water governance conceptualization of trust stakeholders sustainable collaboration empirical foundations systematic literature review data availability data has been made available and is added to be published as an online file 1 introduction recent years have witnessed growing academic attention to the role of trust in water governance e g de vries et al 2017 lubell 2007 onencan et al 2018 wheeler et al 2017 trust is deemed important because water governance often requires collaboration and coordination between a wide range of public and private stakeholders these stakeholders are often bound by different geographical and functional jurisdictions lubell and lippert 2011 they may have different conflicting interests concerning various aspects of water governance such as water safety quality supply and ecology edelenbos and van meerkerk 2015 and they often develop diverse perspectives on problems and their consequent solutions benson and jordan 2010 unsustainable land use and increasing scarcity intensifies competition for water while climate change simultaneously requires that additional efforts are made to provide protection against drought and the occurrence of water related hazards woodhouse and muller 2017 in such complex circumstances the development of mutual trust between stakeholders is supposed to be necessary to facilitate shared understanding and concerted action e g ansell and gash 2007 van meerkerk and edelenbos 2014 trust between stakeholders is a means to deal with the complexity and uncertainty of interactions as the need to continuously monitor and enforce future actions will be less imminent under conditions of mutual trust lubell 2007 onencan et al 2018 therefore it is assumed that trust facilitates long term collaboration stern and baird 2015 and fosters cooperation and compliance by both the wider public and stakeholders directly involved with public policies and environmental management practices lafuente et al 2018 stern 2008 statements about the essential role of trust for sustainable collaboration also abound in the literature on water governance practices e g hamm et al 2013 leahy and anderson 2008 rogers and hall 2003 nevertheless it is not known to what extent such statements rely on shared conceptualizations of trust and are underpinned by solid empirical evidence the knowledge base on trust in water governance seems fragmented pahl wostl 2015 and it remains unclear what the possibilities are for valid systematic comparisons of empirical findings on the role of trust for example there is limited understanding of how studies on the role of trust in water governance are influenced by variations that may exist across different water governance sub issues e g flood protection drought management water quality environmental protection geographical contexts and scales in addition attempts to evaluate the knowledge base of articles and to systematically compare their findings may also be hindered by different conceptualizations of the concept of trust itself in water governance studies davenport et al 2007 lijeblad et al 2009 pahl wostl 2015 stern and coleman 2015 finally for the comparability of research findings we believe it is also of value to get an overview of the research approaches and methods that are employed to address these knowledge gaps this article provides to our knowledge the first systematic overview of how the water governance literature engages with trust as a conceptual lens an analytical device and empirical phenomenon and it reveals whether engagement with trust varies along the lines of some of the structural features of the water governance field such as sub issues geography and scales to provide this overview we conducted an explorative systematic literature review adapted for our needs in the context of an emerging research field in the social sciences e g petticrew and roberts 2006 torraco 2005 the next section of this article section 2 theoretically justifies the criteria on the basis of which we evaluate the way in which trust is studied in the field of water governance subsequently we describe how those theoretical considerations informed our research design our method literature selection and our data extraction protocol section 3 the centrepiece of our article presents the results of the systematic review section 4 the review concludes with a discussion and lines for future research sections 5 6 2 aspects of the literature that we review and justification of our analytical criteria 2 1 boundaries within the field sub issues geography and scales we understand water governance as the range of political social economic and administrative systems that are in place to develop and manage water resources and the delivery of water services at different levels of society rogers and hall 2003 p 7 as such we consider interactions between stakeholders that shape and are part of these systems as important elements of water governance although all articles that we review fit under the generic label of being studies on water governance several studies more particularly focus on specific sub issues such as flood protection managing the consequences of drought water quality management and environmental protection as these various issues all have their own distinct structural elements and most likely involve different sets of actors it is not guaranteed that the extent to which trust appears and the way in which it functions is similar when breaking down the research field in different thematic sub areas thus assessing how studies on the role of trust in water governance practices are distributed and differ among various sub issues of water governance is a first important aspect incorporated in our review geographic locations constitute a second type of structural element in the literature in the sense that the role of trust in water governance issues may more often be studied in some locations than others moreover the actual way in which trust is studied may also differ substantially between different locations and cultures the distinction between developed versus developing countries could be especially relevant in this regard as several challenges of water governance are most acute in developing countries while the conditions for trust building are at the same time more challenging araral and wang 2013 pahl wostl 2015 in addition to location specific distinctions there is also a need to distinguish between water governance issues at different geographical scales the role of trust in establishing sustainable water governance practices may be different at the local scale than at larger scale regional national cross boundary settings where the levels of complexity and uncertainty are different often requiring decision making at a larger or multi level scale to achieve satisfactory outcomes pahl wostl 2015 woodhouse and muller 2017 therefore we deem it important to investigate to what extent studies on the role of trust in water governance vary with regard to geographic locations and scales 2 2 studying trust conceptual underpinning and operationalization trust has widely been studied in various social and management sciences e g hamm 2017 nielsen 2011 uslaner 2018 from different perspectives e g fulmer and gelfand 2012 stern and coleman 2015 and with different conceptualizations lubell 2007 rousseau et al 1998 despite this diversity most applied studies that conceptualize trust share the idea that trust is basically a psychological state of a truster subject of trust comprising positive expectations or negative in case of distrust that a trustee object of trust has certain competences and the goodwill to successfully perform an action on which the truster runs the risk of facing negative consequences rousseau et al 1998 siegrist et al 2000 in its most basic form a trust relation has been summarized by hardin 2002 p 9 as a trusts b concerning matters x more recently an extended formulation designates that a truster a trusts judges the trustworthiness of a trustee b with regard to some behavior x in context y at time t bauer 2019 p 2 following this latter definition trust is not only a relational attitude of the truster a towards the actions of the trustee b but is at its basic level context specific and dynamic to theoretically ground empirical studies on trust and to make them better comparable means that complete assessments of trust relationships should provide a clear conceptualization in which they ideally acknowledge the issue specific nature of trust which acknowledges that a trusts b to perform a specific task but may be less trusting regarding another task lewicki et al 2006 while simultaneously taking into account that trusters may adapt their expectations over time bauer and freitag 2018 however to what extent applied studies provide clear definitions of trust and whether conceptual or empirical descriptions of trust incorporate complete accounts of trust relationships including elements a to y is nebulous as such gaining an overview to what extent and in which way trust is conceptualized emerges as a first conceptual issue for our review in addition investigating to what extent trust is incorporated in the research questions or problem statements of articles provides further insights into the extent to which the concept of trust is fully and coherently incorporated in the research designs of articles being specific about who are the subjects a who are trusting and the objects b who are trusted is another key point in understanding trust relations when it comes to the subject of trust the trusters it is generally agreed that trust has its basis in individuals or groups of individuals bauer 2019 in this perspective collective level units such as organizations or political institutions are not themselves capable of trusting each other only the collectively held trust orientation of the group members of such organizations or institutions make it possible to speak about collective level trust relationships such as inter organizational trust zaheer et al 1998 others however argue that the subject of trust may also take the form of a group stern and coleman 2015 the latter approach highlights that collectively defined trust orientations of collective level actors may become forces in themselves which are able to shape the individual level trust orientations of ingroup members elias and scotson 1994 when it comes to the object of trust the trustee trusters may first place trust in other individuals in its dyadic form such individual level trust relations may vary from trust in close relatives to trust in more distant actors such as individual politicians or other officeholders such dyadic trust relations are often spoken of as instances of interpersonal trust simpson 2007 a conceptualization we follow in this paper in contrast to authors who use interpersonal trust to designate an individual s general tendency to trust others johnson george and swap 1982 besides trust in individuals trusters commonly also direct trust to collective level entities such as social groups private companies and government organizations institutional trust zaheer et al 1998 finally trust in abstract objects such as formal rules norms principles and scientific knowledge is sometimes classified as an additional object category of trust e g cockerill et al 2004 dalton 2004 given this diversity several actors both at the individual and collective level may be the actual subjects and or objects of trust in real world trust relationships in the water governance context various individual actors such as citizens farmers ecologists water managers or particular officeholders as well as collective actors such as water management organizations ngos and all kinds of government branches can be either subject or object of trust however to what extent studies on trust in water governance actually consider different subjects and objects of trust relevant for their specific inquiry and whether this matters for the findings on trust is currently not known another priority for our review should therefore be to trace whether the literature on trust in water governance clearly specifies between subjects and objects of trust and examine the relationships that appear in real world trust relationships furthermore we deem it important to know whether the role of trust differs for different subject object combinations finally several articles on trust theory from the social and management sciences break down the concept of trust into different subtypes of trust a commonly adopted perspective that already takes into account who are the subjects and objects of trust distinguishes between the general tendency to trust others appearing under various labels such as social trust or interpersonal trust and institutional trust trust based upon expectations that organizations institutions will act according to the ideals of impartiality fairness and efficiency seifert 2018 zaheer et al 1998 additionally scholars also distinguish between subtypes of trust based on characteristics of the subject of trust and the processes leading to trust its antecedent this results in a commonly accepted distinction among a trust as stemming from relatively stable psychological attributes of individual trusters b trust as stemming from cognitively based calculative processes and c trust as based upon affinities and socially embedded properties of relationships between people rousseau et al 1998 stern and coleman 2015 as analytical frameworks that break down the concept of trust to its component parts are arguably more fruitful in explaining trust relationships in real world contexts than more basic understandings of trust stern and coleman 2015 identifying to what extent trust is conceptualized regarding its component parts is a third conceptual issue that we address in our review on the role of trust 2 3 trust in water governance empirically studied approaches and methods to establish a coherent understanding of how trust is empirically studied in the domain of water governance issues we believe it is also of value to get an overview of the diverse research approaches and methods that have so far been deployed in line with the fragmented nature of the knowledge base in water governance issues individual case studies abound in the field pahl wostl 2015 but as appropriate research designs need to capture as much of the complexity of water governance processes as possible scholars have advocated a shift towards comparative case study approaches and a focus on methodological pluralism cook and bakker 2012 pahl wostl and lebel 2011 we agree that exploratory analyses comprising a large number of cases and in depth case studies can complement each other e g pahl wostl 2015 therefore we investigate the existing diversity in the research approaches and data collection methods in the set of articles that empirically assess the role of trust as trust may both be a facilitator as well as an outcome of water governance processes edelenbos and van meerkerk 2015 klijn et al 2010 stern and coleman 2015 we deem it important to reveal to what extent applied studies focus on both possible roles of trust in the water governance context finally as an indication of the basis for such directional claims we investigate to what extent they are supported by reference to earlier research and analysis of empirical data present in the article 3 research design and methods 3 1 systematic review although synthesizing qualitative and quantitative empirical findings on a particular topic has traditionally been the main focus of systematic reviews liberati et al 2009 systematic reviews are also increasingly used to provide a first systematic inventory of emerging research fields that would benefit from the development of new research frameworks and more holistic conceptualizations fischer et al 2021 torraco 2005 given our purpose to provide a first systematic overview of how the rapidly growing literature on trust in water governance engages with trust as a conceptual lens analytical device and empirical phenomenon it is this more explorative type of literature review which suits our interests best this review relies on reproducible methods for identifying evaluating and synthesizing characteristics of completed work in a field fischer et al 2021 snyder 2019 through which we aim for making this review systematic and critical in its appraisal of existing conceptualizations and research approaches 3 2 article selection our review started with an article selection procedure the flowchart in fig 1 provides an overview of the entire article selection process we first identified all articles of which the title abstract or keywords suggest that both the concept of trust as well as the issue of water governance are captured using two scientific searching engines scopus and web of knowledge we searched for articles in which the term trust which also includes subsidiary terms such as distrust trustful and trustworthy appears in combination with either one of the terms water governance water management or water policy 1 1 we understand the concept of water governance in a broad sense so that it also refers to related but sometimes more stringently defined sub concepts such as water management and water policy making e g pahl wostl 2009 technically we used the following searching criteria topic title abs key trust and water governance or water management or water polic no time limitations have been set for the period from which we retain articles in january 2020 this search string obtained 500 articles that we subsequently subjected to a first screening round based on the titles and abstracts to identify and exclude off topic articles we excluded 115 articles that were mainly on the topics of trust funds public trust doctrines or articles with a technical focus from the natural sciences in which trust and water governance only incidentally appeared at the start of the second stage of our article selection process we obtained with assistance of the libraries of our institutions full text access to 374 of the 386 articles that we retained after step one we subjected those 374 articles to a second screening round now based on the full texts after which we eliminated another 66 articles from our list that were off topic or not written in english finally we checked how often the term trust or one of its derivatives appeared in the 308 remaining articles this check shows that in 30 5 of the 308 articles that we coded the word trust or one of its derivatives appears less than five times in other words trust only plays a very marginal role in those articles to focus our investigation about the role of trust in water governance to articles that deal substantially with the concept of trust we limited our main analyses to the 200 articles in which the term trust appears at least five times 2 2 we nevertheless coded the first thirteen questions from our protocol for the 108 articles in which trust appeared less than five times the results show that trust indeed hardly plays a role in those articles none of these articles comes up with a definition of trust neither does any of these articles adopt a conceptual distinction between different subtypes of trust 3 3 data extraction to analyze the 200 articles in our final sample we developed a coding protocol with coding instructions see online appendix a this protocol first covers questions to obtain basic article identification information this includes questions on the type of journals publishing the articles the dates of publication whether the article is empirical or conceptual and what sub issue s of water governance is are addressed to code the sub issues within the field of water governance we first had a team discussion in which we identified flood management drought management water quality management water distribution management and environmental conservation as the most likely sub categories of water governance practices we then coded to what extent the discussion in each article fitted into one or more of those categories or whether the issue should be classified as other we continued with a set of questions on the importance of trust in each article and its theoretical foundation subsequently we identify the subjects and objects of trust that are discussed in each article although the subjects and objects of trust are commonly easier to identify in the cases in which trust is empirically studied we also coded subjects of trust in cases in which they are only discussed in the more theoretical sections of articles furthermore we allowed multiple entries as several subjects objects of trust could simultaneously be discussed and thus coded in a single article some of the coded articles also use generic terms to refer to multiple subjects objects of trust at the same time such terms for example include inter actor trust stakeholder trust and network trust in cases that such generic terms appeared we always separately coded them as generic terms for several subjects objects of trust when articles went into further detail about the involved actors we additionally coded those more specific subjects of trust the next questions in the protocol ask about the geographic location and scale at which studies are performed and about the conclusions of the reviewed studies regarding the role of trust in water governance processes n 200 finally a last group of questions addresses how studies are performed and what methods have been used whereas the full sample of 200 articles contained many empirical articles n 164 we find that only a slight majority of 58 n 92 of the 164 empirical articles investigate the role of trust in water governance processes in their empirics as our interest is only in the design and methods of studies that address trust in their empirics we coded these methodological characteristics only for the sub sample of 92 articles that empirically address trust preliminary versions of the protocol have been tested and revised by several co authors all co authors agreed on the final version of the codebook and subsequently coded their subset of articles thirty seven articles were coded by two coders to determine intercoder agreement across non text based fields agreement of 80 or above was initially achieved across most of the variables with numerical answer categories reported in appendix a after discussions between the main coders a few variables have been re coded to reach this level of agreement questions that did not reach the 80 threshold level are not further discussed in our result section the remaining text based fields e g the definitions of trust and examples of causal directions have been used to qualitatively inform our analyses data is made available in the supplements to this article 4 results in this section we first present a descriptive overview of the 200 articles in our sample and report which sub issues of water governance are addressed by each article 4 1 next we show the spread of the sampled studies across geographies and scales 4 2 how trust is conceptualized 4 3 and what type of trust relations are most studied 4 4 finally we report how trust in water governance is empirically studied in the subset of 92 articles that contain such an analysis 4 5 to clearly distinguish between the articles in our sample our primary data and subsidiary literature used in this article we refer to articles from our sample with their id number in squared brackets online appendix b shows the bibliographical references belonging to these id numbers 4 1 trust in the water governance literature an emerging but dispersed field most of the 200 articles from our full dataset appeared in a broad selection of 106 different journals four articles appeared as conference proceedings while one article appeared as a book chapter individual journals which published five or more articles from our list are water 13 articles the international journal of water resources 8 articles environmental science and policy 8 articles ecology and society 6 articles the journal of environmental management 5 articles the journal of hydrology 5 articles and society and natural resources 5 articles a large majority of the 200 articles are empirical studies 82 we classified the other articles as theoretical review articles 13 5 policy analyses 1 5 case descriptions 1 or other 2 fig 2 shows that the number of annually published articles on trust in water governance is progressively increasing although the selected articles range over a time span from 1997 to 2019 only 20 of the 200 articles appeared before the year 2010 while 2018 has so far appeared as the most fruitful year with a total number of 31 published articles overall those findings reassert our initial impression that the trust in water governance literature is in rapid development the results presented in table 1 reveal that there is substantial variation in how often different thematic sub issues that fit under the generic label of water governance practices are addressed by the articles in our sample a large majority of 70 of the 200 articles only deal with a single water governance sub issue around 21 percent of the articles deal with two sub issues while 10 of the articles simultaneously address three or more sub issues of water governance the sub issues which are most addressed are water distribution addressed in 30 of all articles and water quality 29 5 other sub issues such as environmental conservation 15 5 flood management 12 and drought management 10 5 appear less frequently in the literature forty seven percent of all the articles include a substantive issue that could only be classified into the other water issues category interpretation of the text variable which describes those topics listed as other shows that several of those articles deal with issues of transboundary water governance or with water governance in a general sense 4 2 dominance of western geographies and studies at single scale the examination of the spread across geographies and scales revealed two main patterns first the dataset shows a clear dominance of studies that cover western geographies notably europe 22 of all the studies and north america 21 5 in addition most of the studies that cover oceania 12 are in fact from australia or new zealand in contrast there were relatively few studies from african 8 or latin american 6 5 countries table 2 we also find that studies from these continents and asia are cited less than half as many times as studies performed in western geographies table c2 in online appendix c recognizing the acuteness of water related issues in africa and latin america olagunju et al 2019 trimble et al 2021 this indicates a considerable mismatch in scholarly attention having said that we have to take into account that we focused on studies in english as such we have not included studies in spanish or french both important languages in the global south second a clear trend emerged in that studies tend to focus on a single geographical scale for instance 77 of the studies investigated water governance issues within a single country and 46 of the studies examined issues from a single region or watershed within a country only a limited number of the articles adopted cases based on a region or watershed that crosses international borders 8 5 or cross country comparative approaches based on comparing local 5 5 or regional 7 5 case studies from different countries tables 2 and 3 additional investigation of how the sub issues of water governance are spread over the different geographies that we distinguished reveal several interesting patterns in how the thematic focus of studies from different areas considerably varies table c7 in online appendix c trust in relation to flood management is for example typically studied in the european context half of all the articles on trust in flood management are from european cases flooding is not or hardly ever studied in relation to trust in studies that focus on africa latin america and oceania at the other hand the issue of drought management and trust is hardly studied in the european context which is surprising given the climatic trend of dryer and hotter summers in the continent which causes extensive problems for agriculture and water distribution grillakis 2019 studies on trust in relation to water quality issues most commonly appear in the north american context while the dominant focus in articles from asia and africa is on the issue of water distribution finally an important insight is that although trust in water related environmental conservation is often studied in the western context this sub issue is hardly ever studied in southern contexts africa asia latin america 4 3 limited conceptual clarity and an emphasis on the instrumental role of trust a key finding from our review is that overall the available body of research on trust in water governance suffers from limited conceptual clarity only 11 5 n 23 of the articles included an explicit definition of trust and of these only 16 articles offered a reference to clarify the proposed conceptualization two sources are cited more than once namely hardin 2002 and rousseau et al 1998 although only cited twice the definitions in nine articles ids 62 87 109 152 152 181 225 236 271 366 in essence come down to hardin s basic understanding of a trust relationship see section 2 in which a subject of trust a trusts the object b concerning matters x besides mentioning those three core components of a trust relationship none of the definitions of trust in the mentioned articles include the elements of context specificity and the dynamic nature timing of trust bauer and freitag 2018 lewicki et al 2006 however a few articles in fact do discuss the dynamic and context specific nature of trust see for example de vries et al 2017 id 87 marks and zadoroznyj 2005 id 234 but did not incorporate such notions in their definitions of trust overall our results show that the theoretical insights that trust relationships are often context specific and change over time bauer and freitag 2018 are only very marginally incorporated in the literature on trust in water governance in addition we find that half of the articles with explicit definitions of trust n 11 resonate with the view of rousseau et al 1998 that trust is a psychological state of a truster based upon positive expectations of the intentions or behavior of the trustee albeit only in two cases with a cited reference to rousseau ids 109 121 152 169 181 206 225 236 250 271 332 the other 12 articles that offer a definition of trust are neutral about what type of expectations trusters develop the article by cisneros 2019 p 29 id 62 for example simply states that trust is the expectation that an individual has of the behavior of other stakeholders in a collaborative partnership still this suggests that in those cases where trust is defined the emphasis is often times on its positive character a clear research question or goal related to trust appeared in only 17 n 33 of the 200 articles again further interpretation identified a clear pattern in that about half of these articles stated a question or goal wherein the reason to engage with trust is primarily motivated due to instrumental reasons i e enhancing trust is seen as a strategy to achieve other objectives olsen 2006 steen and rutgers 2011 which stands in contrast to for instance studies that focus on trust for its intrinsic value for example several articles focus on how to build trust in water governance practices e g ids 6 45 61 152 272 or how trust can increase the acceptance of certain water policies or technologies e g ids 11 111 120 233 234 367 the other half of the articles posed more descriptive questions without any explicit view on the presumed role of trust only 16 n 32 of the articles distinguish between different subtypes of trust the subtype of trust that is most commonly mentioned is institutional trust mostly to distinguish this type of trust from interpersonal trust ids 50 156 159 180 181 308 346 378 a few other articles apply a distinction between institutional trust and other more particular types of trust such as trust in actual officeholders administrations sometimes labelled as political trust ids 45 104 158 169 330 380 in addition only a few articles in the review actively mention but do commonly not operationalize and test a distinction between antecedent based subtypes of trust such as dispositional trust calculative trust and affinity based trust ids 104 117 181 225 236 271 276 366 in spite of the mentioned efforts to more extensively conceptualize trust overall our findings show that most articles deal with trust as a single umbrella concept that refers to various social relations and actors finally when assessing the conceptual clarity of articles within each of the different sub issues of water governance we find that the term trust on average appears significantly less often in articles on flood prevention and nature conservation than in articles on the other issues furthermore trust is hardly ever defined in the areas of drought management and water quality management and distinctions between subtypes of trust hardly ever occur in articles on flood management and drought prevention table c8 in online appendix c when comparing between continents we find that definitions of trust occur relative the least in papers on cases from north america asia and latin america subtypes of trust are the least distinguished in cases from asia oceania and latin america while research questions on trust appear less often in papers dealing with asian cases table c9 in online appendix c nevertheless we do not see a clear division between articles from northern and southern contexts when it comes to the conceptual clarity of the papers with regard to the geographical scales of the investigations we find that trust is less often defined in cross border and comparative papers than in case studies on the local regional or national scale cross border studies and comparative studies that focus on regions also lag behind when it comes to distinguishing subtypes of trust and adopting research questions involving trust table c10 in online appendix c 4 4 trust relations a focus on trust of the general public in government organizations while the articles in our sample exhibited considerable diversity regarding the trusters subjects and trustees objects under study table 4 and associated trust relations table 5 some patterns emerged trust that ordinary citizens hold is by far the most prevalent focus when it comes to the subjects of trust appears in 49 of the articles individual farmers 26 water managers 17 and individual government employees 16 are also in focus as subjects of trust at the level of collectively held trust orientations the entities that are most often discussed as trusters are local and national level government organizations 25 other collectively held trust orientations are less often studied it is noteworthy how social groups that tend to find themselves marginalized in water governance such as ethnic minorities and indigenous peoples e g hoogesteger 2012 wester et al 2003 are little represented as the subjects of trust in studies on the role of trust in water governance citizens or individual level actors appear in 22 of the articles as the object of trust this means that individuals are considerably less often studied as trustees than as trusters as objects of trust the articles that we coded primarily focus on trust in governmental organizations such as trust in local and regional governments 57 national level executive water management agencies 34 and national level government policy maker 33 other group level entities such as social groups 16 private companies firms 16 and ngos 20 also commonly appear as the object of trust interestingly only 3 of the articles paid attention to supranational government levels as objects of trust something we find surprising given the fact that many water related policies today are developed at supranational levels e g in the eu other objects of trust that rarely appear are trust in formal water management rules laws directives trust in water related knowledge facts is the last object of trust that is regularly mentioned 20 while trust in scientists receives little attention 5 we furthermore assessed how often particular subject object combinations appear to categorize the particular trust relations that are most commonly studied table 5 we find that by far the most prevalent focus is on trust of individual citizens in government agencies 55 mutual trust relations between non state affiliated actors at the group level socially defined groups private companies and ngo s and government organizations 28 trust of individual citizens in non state affiliated actors at the group level 22 and trust of individuals in other individuals 20 are also commonly addressed trust relations that are not so commonly studied are trust between different non state affiliated group level actors 15 trust of government organizations in other government organizations 12 and finally trust between nation states 6 we also note a considerable diversity in the literature when it comes to the number of specific trust relationships that are addressed in the articles a first type of article takes a broad approach by focusing on multiple reciprocal trust relations between a set of different subjects and objects of trust several of those articles 15 of all articles do not explicitly describe the particular subjects and objects of trust but rely upon more generic and also more imprecise terms such as inter agency trust stakeholder trust or network trust to refer to the entire set of trust relations in multi actor constellations among the articles that do not adopt such generic terms we still find several articles that in fact address multiple i e more than one subjects 50 or objects 59 of trust on the other hand there is also a sizeable set of articles 41 with a focus on a single unidirectional trust relation that only addresses the trust of a particular truster in a single type of trustee additionally we find substantial variation in the specific trust relations and the various subjects and objects of trust when separately investigating those relations within the thematic sub issues of water governance the most notable findings regarding the subjects of trust are that individual citizens are highly prevalent in the sub issue of water quality management 64 while they are comparatively understudied in the subfield of drought management 14 farmers as the subject of trust are relatively important in the fields of drought management 29 and water distribution 35 while water managers often appear in most sub issues except for drought management 10 and water quality management 7 indigenous populations and other non indigenous minority groups do seldom play a role as subjects of trust and when they do they mainly play a role in the issue of nature conservation in 13 of the articles on this issue another finding is that individuals as the object of trust are less prominent than as the subject of trust individual actors as objects of trust do not appear very often in the sub issues of drought management 14 water quality management 14 and nature conservation 10 furthermore social groups as the object of trust are marginally studied in drought management civil society as the object of trust most commonly appears in the issue areas of flooding 29 and nature conservation 29 supra national governments as the objects of trust are only discussed in the issue areas of flooding water quality management and nature conservation for the particular trust relations specific subject object combinations we find that trust of individual trusters in individual trustees is relatively understudied within the sub issues of water quality management 9 and nature conservation 13 relations between individuals and non state affiliated groups get above average attention in the subfield of water quality management 24 while they are understudied in the subfield of drought management 10 trust of individual citizens in governmental actors individual officeholders as well as institutions is particularly well studied for the issues of water quality management 58 and nature conservation 54 relations between nation states are comparatively often studied in the fields of flooding 13 and droughts 14 while within the other subfields the percentages are below 7 4 5 trust empirically studied emphasis on trust as explanatory variable among the 92 articles that include an empirical assessment of the role of trust in water governance the majority comprise of case study approaches 58 written surveys 55 and oral interviews 51 are the most adopted data collection methods there was an almost even spread across quantitative 34 and qualitative 27 analyses with a large part also combining qualitative and quantitative methods 38 in terms of measuring the concept of trust most of the studies posed questions that directly ask about a subject s level of trust 70 yet a substantial number of 18 of the articles investigated trust by means of related concepts such as satisfaction id 61 the absence of conflicts id 15 the willingness to co operate id 1 or legitimacy id 140 for 12 of the articles that included an empirical assessment of trust there was no account of how trust was actually measured overall this shows that trust is in about a third of the articles not unequivocally operationalized which should be considered when assessing whether the findings on trust are valid moreover we find that a large majority of the empirical findings on trust are centered on directional claims 92 namely that trust explains or is explained by several other variables with which trust is associated table 6 a few articles 8 only report levels of trust as a result of an empirical investigation in line with our earlier observation in section 4 3 about the oftentimes presumed instrumental role of trust our review of the directionality of the empirically assessed trust claims points at an emphasis on trust as an explanatory variable 52 i e as a variable that positively affects other water governance related outcomes of primary concern such as participation and cooperation with projects and policies ids 81 88 128 132 180 253 291 293 330 346 351 354 376 behavioral adaptations such as drinking desalinated water or water usage habits ids 61 133 235 238 272 289 adoption of environmental friendly water related techniques ids 3 92 158 246 261 340 344 355 improved communication or social learning ids 62 201 269 about one fifth of the studies focus on trust as an outcome 18 5 identified variables that positively and or negatively affect trust include the structural and social complexities of water governance issues ids 1 8 9 157 234 236 353 339 levels of stakeholder involvement and collaborative efforts ids 1 45 56 336 information procession and message framing ids 121 130 234 236 332 339 361 381 and attitudes to risk ids 104 116 fourteen articles 15 investigate trust as both an outcome and an explanatory variable in their empirical analyses hurlimann id 162 for example simultaneously looks at the effect of the accurateness of information on trust in water recycling and the effect of trust on risk perceptions finally another nine 10 of the articles with directional claims deal with trust as a mediator moderator intermediate variable nancarrow leviston porter and tucker id 262 for example did not find a direct effect of trust on intended behaviors but they found an indirect effect of trust due to its mediating role in the relation between risk assessments and behavioral intentions while we did not conduct any systematic quality assurance we did investigate how the claims about trust were substantiated in the 92 studies we find that quite a large number of 69 75 of the 92 articles demonstrate their main claim on the role of trust both with references to the existing literature as well as by means of their empirical analyses on trust a smaller number of 16 17 of the 92 articles only rely on empirical findings to support their claims on trust this level of substantiation in those 92 articles stands in strong contrast with the substantiation of the claims on trust in the 108 articles from the entire set of 200 articles that did not empirically investigate trust in this latter group claims on trust are only supported by means of references to existing literature or not substantiated at all this resonates with further comparisons of these groups most notably that the level of conceptual clarity on trust is relatively better developed although still often limited in the 92 articles that contain empirical analyses involving trust 5 discussion the research that elucidates the concept of trust and its importance in the context of water governance has expanded considerably since the early 1990s with 80 of all articles on the subject having appeared since 2010 nevertheless our review revealed that the overall knowledge base has remained fragmented which is in line with statements made about the state of the broader water governance literature as well e g pahl wostl 2015 2012 trust is a multi dimensional concept that scholars have explored from very different angles using different approaches this makes it difficult to integrate different insights and to develop an all encompassing theory of trust in water governance although diversity can also mean an enrichment of the literature it currently mainly reflects the elusive nature of trust and hence the challenges of advancing the theoretical and empirical understanding of trust the papers included in this literature review show that trust is a key issue in many water governance practices yet understanding its exact role and functioning and developing integrated knowledge on how to understand trust in water governance requires more research in the sections below we more thoroughly reflect upon the main findings of our systematic literature review and connect these to recommendations for advancing future research on trust in the field of water governance finally we discuss the limitations of our own study and end the article with a few concluding remarks 5 1 discussion of the main findings in relation to future research needs 5 1 1 don t neglect the extant conceptualization problem our review generally corroborates the claim that trust is poorly conceptualized in water governance research with respect to our set of conceptual criteria on definitions research questions goals and subtypes of trust we find that a vast majority 89 of studies in our sample use the term trust without adopting any explicit statements that define trust moreover among the small group of articles that do in fact define trust there is considerable diversity in conceptualizing trust as was expected by davenport et al 2007 lijeblad et al 2009 pahl wostl 2015 stern and coleman 2015 only a dozen studies clearly acknowledge the relational nature of trust while context specific and or dynamic elements of trust are not mentioned at all in any of the definitional statements on trust notwithstanding we observed a few occasions in which those elements are discussed in theoretical sections of papers e g de vries et al 2017 id 87 marks and zadoroznyj 2005 id 234 altogether these findings show that studies on trust in water governance are falling behind on some of the current developments in the broader literature on trust bauer and freitag 2018 lewicki et al 2006 future progress first requires that more studies define and conceptualize trust second to provide more complete assessments of trust relationships we recommend studies to keep up with the broader literature on trust and the broader water governance literature by means of clearly acknowledging and empirically uncovering the context specific and dynamic nature of trust relationships see also lubell 2007 id 225 in addition our review also shows that only a very selective number of articles incorporate the concept of trust into their stated research questions although for some articles this may result from trust only being a concept of subsidiary concern for other papers in our sample i e those papers in which trust in fact plays a major role this suggests that more careful attention could be given to the concept of trust in the framing of research goals and questions notably most studies tend to assess trust as an umbrella term rather than looking at its different dimensions stern and coleman 2015 hence the lack of more extensively developed trust frameworks limits the ability to understand these different dimensions of trust how they relate to each other and how they affect or are affected by other aspects of water governance pahl wostl 2015 reiersen 2019 we advise future studies to rely upon more extensively developed trust frameworks so that the effects of trust can be empirically assessed and understood with regard to some of its component parts such approaches may follow the lead of some of the articles that we consider as good practice examples such as lubell s 2007 id 225 study that assesses the independent effects of different types of generalized trust on trust in specific water policies onencan et al s 2018 id 271 study that distinguishes between dis trust and trustworthiness in a game based approach to model cooperation in shared river basin collective action problems or jorgensen et al s 2009 id 181 investigation of the interplay between institutional trust and inter personal trust in explaining water use behavior 5 1 2 pick up on the understudied role of trust in several sub issue geography combinations water governance studies have mostly focused on the role of trust in issues such as water distribution especially papers on water distribution for agricultural use and water quality predominantly articles on public opinion on drinking water provision we found that considerably less attention has been paid to the role of trust in issues such as environmental conservation flood management and drought management in terms of geographical locations on which extant studies have focused we most prominently find that little research has yet been conducted on the role of trust in water governance in the global south africa asia latin america although one might argue that some of these latter issues simply appear less often especially in the context of the global south and that the role of trust is also less relevant in these issues contexts we would argue that this is not necessarily the case and that the role of trust in water governance practices is understudied in the global south specifically for specific sub issue geography combinations there are several examples of highly relevant water related issues from within these contexts that need to be governed in settings that require trust a few examples include the recent water crisis in the city of cape town maxmen 2018 massive flooding events in mozambique malawi and zimbabwe charrua et al 2021 and the life threatening droughts in eastern africa gebremeskel haile et al 2019 in the context of the global south our review shows that more attention could particularly be paid to the role of trust in issues of flood prevention and environmental conservation which are issues that despite their common occurrence and relevance in these contexts are hardly ever studied in combination with trust in the northern especially european context on the other hand studies on the role of trust in drought management are currently underexplored finally the findings on the geographical scales of studies suggest a need for more studies with a multi level international focus and studies that for example compare a set of local or regional case studies from different contexts and or countries given the numerous water governance issues that extent borders studies that go beyond a single national case are surprisingly scarce as the role of trust and the causal mechanisms associated with trust might well be different in these understudied contexts we might miss out on several important theoretical insights which makes paying more attention to these contexts all the more important 5 1 3 towards a larger diversity of the subjects objects of trust in line with the fragmented nature of the field of water governance itself in which numerous actors are involved in several different issues e g lubell and lippert 2011 id 223 woodhouse and muller 2017 we find a considerable diversity regarding the trusters subjects and trustees objects that are discussed by the entire set of studies overall one can see two different streams in the literature one focusing on public trust in government and water managers and the other focusing on trust between various collaborating actors within water governance both have a distinct focus and their own approach yet both write about trust and therefore some confusion can arise the more traditional actors within water governance processes receive most of the scholarly attention governments at the local regional and national scale and specific water management organizations are the most common objects of trust in the studies in our sample it could be relevant to extent this focus to the international level and analyze how different forms of trust impact the possibilities for the formulation and adaption of international policies as well as how trust plays a role in their implementation that we also identified trust in water related knowledge as one of the central objects of trust speaks to the importance of such knowledge in relation to legitimizing actions and enhancing credibility of specific actors e g mase et al 2015 id 236 medema et al 2014 id 256 the general public individual citizens most often appears as the subject of trust much less attention is paid to how trust levels differ between groups within society while the experiences and trust development of marginalized groups in societies including ethnic minorities and indigenous peoples hardly gain attention in addition given the scale of some of the water related challenges that water governance faces supranational government levels as objects of trust also deserve more scholarly attention in terms of subject object combinations more attention is required to studies that look at trust relations between different non state affiliated group level actors trust of government organizations in other government organizations and finally trust between nation states in addition the relation between trust in governments and trust between actors involved in collaborative networks requires more attention as participatory and collaborative processes are often initiated to enhance trust in government both concern different dimensions of trust and drawing on the literature little is known about how these relate to each other finally we identified a substantial subgroup of articles that rely upon generic terms to indicate trust relationships such as inter agency trust stakeholder trust or network trust however several of these articles do not specify who the particular stakeholders and or actors are who participate in such networks to be able to more precisely understand how overall network performances are affected by the trust relations between its members we recommend future studies to more clearly identify the involved subjects and objects of trust in networks and to more completely assess such trust relations see for example hickey et al 2021 song et al 2017 5 1 4 going beyond instrumentally motivated reasons to studying trust although it is theoretically expected that trust may manifest itself as a predictor as well as an outcome of water governance processes edelenbos and van meerkerk 2015 klijn et al 2010 stern and coleman 2015 our findings show that the extant literature particularly focusses on approaching trust as an explanatory variable this focus on trust as an explanatory variable comes together with a tendency in several of the articles that we analysed to assume that trust is an attitude which comes with positive consequences for establishing sustainable long term cooperation in water governance processes that require collective action hamm et al 2013 lafuente et al 2018 id 206 lubell 2007 id 225 stern and baird 2015 van meerkerk and edelenbos 2014 a textual analysis of the articles with stated research questions goals and of the content of the directional claims that have been made on trust further revealed the omnipresence of instrumentally motivated reasons to engage with trust for example half of the articles with a clearly specified research question or goal related to trust already state in their introduction sections that they are mainly interested in seeking out how trust can increase acceptance of specific policies governance practices or technologies although not necessarily a problem in all cases we agree with authors that argue that an overtly instrumental focus on trust can obscure the importance of trust building as an end in itself rutgers and schreurs 2006 steen and rutgers 2011 when there is no up front commitment to the process of trust building itself collaborative processes may very well backfire into a loss of trust in case of any unwanted negative outcomes of the practices that initially needed trust to be established ansell and gash 2007 hence we recommend paying more attention to trust as an intrinsically valuable outcome of water governance processes from an empirical perspective we do not dispute that trust in several occasions may indeed play the presumed positive role we found many examples of papers that report positive effects of trust on collective action and collaboration e g baldwin et al 2018 id 17 hoogesteger 2013 id 153 jorgensen et al 2009 id 181 nevertheless the results of our review warrant that we should question the validity and reliability of the knowledge base behind many of such findings and the relevance of such statements many of the claims on trust in water governance are not empirically assessed and in cases in which they are a poor conceptualization of trust in combination with methodological problems to assess trust undermines the validity of discussions on trust furthermore among the articles that did empirically assess the role of trust in water governance some of them in fact suggest that the positive effects of trust may be overrated as cooperation can under certain conditions occur without trust satein and weber 2018 id 308 and higher trust does not always increase actors willingness to contribute to environmental common goods e g franzen et al 2016 id 120 hanemann 2014 id 139 in addition trust building is not always a relevant result of stakeholder involvement processes e g al adwan and hayek 2011 id 5 buchecker et al 2013 id 45 finally our results also raise the question of whether the assumed beneficial effects of trust equally apply to all types of trusters and trustees for example as we have argued above minorities and indigenous groups are scarcely represented as subjects of trust this is a significant finding since individuals from these groups also tend to find themselves marginalized in water governance e g hoogesteger 2012 wester et al 2003 5 1 5 embrace methodological diversity our finding that the majority of the empirical assessments on the role of trust in water governance comprise of individual case study approaches is not surprising given that individual case studies abound in the larger water governance literature pahl wostl 2015 to capture more of the complexities of water governance processes we advocate that comparative approaches are more often adopted e g pahl wostl and lebel 2011 such approaches may consist of or combine exploratory analyses that look at a large number of variables from multiple cases or and in depth studies of selected cases that focus on a reduced number of variables only pahl wostl 2015 p 198 there is also a need for more studies with an international focus and for comparative studies that compare a set of local or regional case studies from different contexts and or countries furthermore although we endorse the substantial variation that exists when it comes to the methods of data collection analyses we observed that participatory methods are hardly applied in the field 5 2 limitations of our systematic review approach there are some methodological limitations of our review approach given our searching procedure we may have missed some unidentified gray literature on trust in water governance as well as non english publications nevertheless we are confident that the sample of articles that we analyzed is representative for the most substantial part of the trust in water governance literature as we coded the full collection of english language academic articles on the topic furthermore some of the protocol development coding and interpretation of the findings was informed by the prior experiences and knowledge that our international group of authors brought to this project although such prior knowledge is inevitable in research and an requirement to guide the methodological process of developing and performing the review it also means that some of the categorizations and interpretations remain selective and non exhaustive fischer et al 2021 finally our choice of focusing on articles that mention the term trust or one if its derivatives at least five times indicates only a modest criteria for inclusion in the review although this choice fitted well with our aim of providing an overview of the way in which trust is discussed in the broader water governance literature it could be argued that future work needs to focus more particularly on a smaller set of studies in which trust is the core concept of the contribution there are also some limitations in terms of potentially relevant content that we did not assess for example a need to broaden our knowledge base may be warranted when it comes to understanding how diverse governance contexts affect the role of trust in more particular water governance issues generalized trust in government institutions and more particular direct trust in stakeholders in water governance issues are only sparingly distinguished from each other and their interrelation barely studied furthermore we could also have assessed more fully the uncritical extrapolation of findings on trust from singular studies that do not recognize the role of contextual variables such as political history governance situation and power relations 6 concluding remarks this systematic literature review has presented an overview of the way in which water governance literature engages with trust as a conceptual lens analytical device and empirical phenomenon the review revealed that the current knowledge base on the role of trust in water governance is fragmented lacks conceptual clarity and is contextually dispersed this state of the literature makes attempts to synthesize towards a sophisticated understanding of the role of trust in the field of water governance difficult if not impossible e g srinivasan et al 2012 woodhouse and muller 2017 a key insight from our review is that future research would contribute towards a more comprehensive and useful understanding of trust in water governance by applying definitions and conceptualizations of trust that clearly acknowledge the context specific and dynamic nature of trust relationships by relying on clear and transparent conceptualizations it is possible to empirically assess various aspects of trust including factors that influence it its possible effects as well as the relationships between subjects and objects of trust we thus foresee that future research could provide relevant and comparable knowledge on trust in water governance within the boundaries of well specified context conditions i e similarity between issues geographies comparable conceptualizations of trust and a focus on similar subject object combinations the analysis and information provided by our review should be of practical relevance for such a research effort since our database and appendices make it possible to identify studies with similarities in terms of the involved conditions contexts and subject object combinations of particular trust relations which enhances the possibilities of context specific comparisons and comparable empirical work a final take home message for researchers and practitioners in the field is to critically assess the role and function of trust in water governance and not assume that it will automatically play a positive role since we found limited well grounded empirical research supporting such claims declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the european commission

19921,trust is generally considered to play a key enabling role in water governance despite this notion there have been no systematic assessments examining the way in which the literature on water governance engages with trust our article fills this gap by providing an overview of the way in which this literature has engaged with trust as a conceptual lens analytical device and empirical phenomenon through an explorative systematic literature review of n 200 mainly peer reviewed journal articles our findings reveal that the knowledge base on the role of trust in water governance is fragmented poorly conceptualized and contextually dispersed we also observe that the role of trust is often understudied especially in the context of the global south and with regard to ethnic minorities and indigenous people as the subjects of trust we recommend that future research should build on solid empirical evidence diversify its foci go beyond an instrumental approach to trust and rely on clear and transparent conceptualizations that acknowledge the context specific and dynamic nature of trust relationships the results of this review should serve to better systemize future research and to further the understanding on the role s of trust in varying contexts and related to different water governance issues graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords trust in water governance conceptualization of trust stakeholders sustainable collaboration empirical foundations systematic literature review data availability data has been made available and is added to be published as an online file 1 introduction recent years have witnessed growing academic attention to the role of trust in water governance e g de vries et al 2017 lubell 2007 onencan et al 2018 wheeler et al 2017 trust is deemed important because water governance often requires collaboration and coordination between a wide range of public and private stakeholders these stakeholders are often bound by different geographical and functional jurisdictions lubell and lippert 2011 they may have different conflicting interests concerning various aspects of water governance such as water safety quality supply and ecology edelenbos and van meerkerk 2015 and they often develop diverse perspectives on problems and their consequent solutions benson and jordan 2010 unsustainable land use and increasing scarcity intensifies competition for water while climate change simultaneously requires that additional efforts are made to provide protection against drought and the occurrence of water related hazards woodhouse and muller 2017 in such complex circumstances the development of mutual trust between stakeholders is supposed to be necessary to facilitate shared understanding and concerted action e g ansell and gash 2007 van meerkerk and edelenbos 2014 trust between stakeholders is a means to deal with the complexity and uncertainty of interactions as the need to continuously monitor and enforce future actions will be less imminent under conditions of mutual trust lubell 2007 onencan et al 2018 therefore it is assumed that trust facilitates long term collaboration stern and baird 2015 and fosters cooperation and compliance by both the wider public and stakeholders directly involved with public policies and environmental management practices lafuente et al 2018 stern 2008 statements about the essential role of trust for sustainable collaboration also abound in the literature on water governance practices e g hamm et al 2013 leahy and anderson 2008 rogers and hall 2003 nevertheless it is not known to what extent such statements rely on shared conceptualizations of trust and are underpinned by solid empirical evidence the knowledge base on trust in water governance seems fragmented pahl wostl 2015 and it remains unclear what the possibilities are for valid systematic comparisons of empirical findings on the role of trust for example there is limited understanding of how studies on the role of trust in water governance are influenced by variations that may exist across different water governance sub issues e g flood protection drought management water quality environmental protection geographical contexts and scales in addition attempts to evaluate the knowledge base of articles and to systematically compare their findings may also be hindered by different conceptualizations of the concept of trust itself in water governance studies davenport et al 2007 lijeblad et al 2009 pahl wostl 2015 stern and coleman 2015 finally for the comparability of research findings we believe it is also of value to get an overview of the research approaches and methods that are employed to address these knowledge gaps this article provides to our knowledge the first systematic overview of how the water governance literature engages with trust as a conceptual lens an analytical device and empirical phenomenon and it reveals whether engagement with trust varies along the lines of some of the structural features of the water governance field such as sub issues geography and scales to provide this overview we conducted an explorative systematic literature review adapted for our needs in the context of an emerging research field in the social sciences e g petticrew and roberts 2006 torraco 2005 the next section of this article section 2 theoretically justifies the criteria on the basis of which we evaluate the way in which trust is studied in the field of water governance subsequently we describe how those theoretical considerations informed our research design our method literature selection and our data extraction protocol section 3 the centrepiece of our article presents the results of the systematic review section 4 the review concludes with a discussion and lines for future research sections 5 6 2 aspects of the literature that we review and justification of our analytical criteria 2 1 boundaries within the field sub issues geography and scales we understand water governance as the range of political social economic and administrative systems that are in place to develop and manage water resources and the delivery of water services at different levels of society rogers and hall 2003 p 7 as such we consider interactions between stakeholders that shape and are part of these systems as important elements of water governance although all articles that we review fit under the generic label of being studies on water governance several studies more particularly focus on specific sub issues such as flood protection managing the consequences of drought water quality management and environmental protection as these various issues all have their own distinct structural elements and most likely involve different sets of actors it is not guaranteed that the extent to which trust appears and the way in which it functions is similar when breaking down the research field in different thematic sub areas thus assessing how studies on the role of trust in water governance practices are distributed and differ among various sub issues of water governance is a first important aspect incorporated in our review geographic locations constitute a second type of structural element in the literature in the sense that the role of trust in water governance issues may more often be studied in some locations than others moreover the actual way in which trust is studied may also differ substantially between different locations and cultures the distinction between developed versus developing countries could be especially relevant in this regard as several challenges of water governance are most acute in developing countries while the conditions for trust building are at the same time more challenging araral and wang 2013 pahl wostl 2015 in addition to location specific distinctions there is also a need to distinguish between water governance issues at different geographical scales the role of trust in establishing sustainable water governance practices may be different at the local scale than at larger scale regional national cross boundary settings where the levels of complexity and uncertainty are different often requiring decision making at a larger or multi level scale to achieve satisfactory outcomes pahl wostl 2015 woodhouse and muller 2017 therefore we deem it important to investigate to what extent studies on the role of trust in water governance vary with regard to geographic locations and scales 2 2 studying trust conceptual underpinning and operationalization trust has widely been studied in various social and management sciences e g hamm 2017 nielsen 2011 uslaner 2018 from different perspectives e g fulmer and gelfand 2012 stern and coleman 2015 and with different conceptualizations lubell 2007 rousseau et al 1998 despite this diversity most applied studies that conceptualize trust share the idea that trust is basically a psychological state of a truster subject of trust comprising positive expectations or negative in case of distrust that a trustee object of trust has certain competences and the goodwill to successfully perform an action on which the truster runs the risk of facing negative consequences rousseau et al 1998 siegrist et al 2000 in its most basic form a trust relation has been summarized by hardin 2002 p 9 as a trusts b concerning matters x more recently an extended formulation designates that a truster a trusts judges the trustworthiness of a trustee b with regard to some behavior x in context y at time t bauer 2019 p 2 following this latter definition trust is not only a relational attitude of the truster a towards the actions of the trustee b but is at its basic level context specific and dynamic to theoretically ground empirical studies on trust and to make them better comparable means that complete assessments of trust relationships should provide a clear conceptualization in which they ideally acknowledge the issue specific nature of trust which acknowledges that a trusts b to perform a specific task but may be less trusting regarding another task lewicki et al 2006 while simultaneously taking into account that trusters may adapt their expectations over time bauer and freitag 2018 however to what extent applied studies provide clear definitions of trust and whether conceptual or empirical descriptions of trust incorporate complete accounts of trust relationships including elements a to y is nebulous as such gaining an overview to what extent and in which way trust is conceptualized emerges as a first conceptual issue for our review in addition investigating to what extent trust is incorporated in the research questions or problem statements of articles provides further insights into the extent to which the concept of trust is fully and coherently incorporated in the research designs of articles being specific about who are the subjects a who are trusting and the objects b who are trusted is another key point in understanding trust relations when it comes to the subject of trust the trusters it is generally agreed that trust has its basis in individuals or groups of individuals bauer 2019 in this perspective collective level units such as organizations or political institutions are not themselves capable of trusting each other only the collectively held trust orientation of the group members of such organizations or institutions make it possible to speak about collective level trust relationships such as inter organizational trust zaheer et al 1998 others however argue that the subject of trust may also take the form of a group stern and coleman 2015 the latter approach highlights that collectively defined trust orientations of collective level actors may become forces in themselves which are able to shape the individual level trust orientations of ingroup members elias and scotson 1994 when it comes to the object of trust the trustee trusters may first place trust in other individuals in its dyadic form such individual level trust relations may vary from trust in close relatives to trust in more distant actors such as individual politicians or other officeholders such dyadic trust relations are often spoken of as instances of interpersonal trust simpson 2007 a conceptualization we follow in this paper in contrast to authors who use interpersonal trust to designate an individual s general tendency to trust others johnson george and swap 1982 besides trust in individuals trusters commonly also direct trust to collective level entities such as social groups private companies and government organizations institutional trust zaheer et al 1998 finally trust in abstract objects such as formal rules norms principles and scientific knowledge is sometimes classified as an additional object category of trust e g cockerill et al 2004 dalton 2004 given this diversity several actors both at the individual and collective level may be the actual subjects and or objects of trust in real world trust relationships in the water governance context various individual actors such as citizens farmers ecologists water managers or particular officeholders as well as collective actors such as water management organizations ngos and all kinds of government branches can be either subject or object of trust however to what extent studies on trust in water governance actually consider different subjects and objects of trust relevant for their specific inquiry and whether this matters for the findings on trust is currently not known another priority for our review should therefore be to trace whether the literature on trust in water governance clearly specifies between subjects and objects of trust and examine the relationships that appear in real world trust relationships furthermore we deem it important to know whether the role of trust differs for different subject object combinations finally several articles on trust theory from the social and management sciences break down the concept of trust into different subtypes of trust a commonly adopted perspective that already takes into account who are the subjects and objects of trust distinguishes between the general tendency to trust others appearing under various labels such as social trust or interpersonal trust and institutional trust trust based upon expectations that organizations institutions will act according to the ideals of impartiality fairness and efficiency seifert 2018 zaheer et al 1998 additionally scholars also distinguish between subtypes of trust based on characteristics of the subject of trust and the processes leading to trust its antecedent this results in a commonly accepted distinction among a trust as stemming from relatively stable psychological attributes of individual trusters b trust as stemming from cognitively based calculative processes and c trust as based upon affinities and socially embedded properties of relationships between people rousseau et al 1998 stern and coleman 2015 as analytical frameworks that break down the concept of trust to its component parts are arguably more fruitful in explaining trust relationships in real world contexts than more basic understandings of trust stern and coleman 2015 identifying to what extent trust is conceptualized regarding its component parts is a third conceptual issue that we address in our review on the role of trust 2 3 trust in water governance empirically studied approaches and methods to establish a coherent understanding of how trust is empirically studied in the domain of water governance issues we believe it is also of value to get an overview of the diverse research approaches and methods that have so far been deployed in line with the fragmented nature of the knowledge base in water governance issues individual case studies abound in the field pahl wostl 2015 but as appropriate research designs need to capture as much of the complexity of water governance processes as possible scholars have advocated a shift towards comparative case study approaches and a focus on methodological pluralism cook and bakker 2012 pahl wostl and lebel 2011 we agree that exploratory analyses comprising a large number of cases and in depth case studies can complement each other e g pahl wostl 2015 therefore we investigate the existing diversity in the research approaches and data collection methods in the set of articles that empirically assess the role of trust as trust may both be a facilitator as well as an outcome of water governance processes edelenbos and van meerkerk 2015 klijn et al 2010 stern and coleman 2015 we deem it important to reveal to what extent applied studies focus on both possible roles of trust in the water governance context finally as an indication of the basis for such directional claims we investigate to what extent they are supported by reference to earlier research and analysis of empirical data present in the article 3 research design and methods 3 1 systematic review although synthesizing qualitative and quantitative empirical findings on a particular topic has traditionally been the main focus of systematic reviews liberati et al 2009 systematic reviews are also increasingly used to provide a first systematic inventory of emerging research fields that would benefit from the development of new research frameworks and more holistic conceptualizations fischer et al 2021 torraco 2005 given our purpose to provide a first systematic overview of how the rapidly growing literature on trust in water governance engages with trust as a conceptual lens analytical device and empirical phenomenon it is this more explorative type of literature review which suits our interests best this review relies on reproducible methods for identifying evaluating and synthesizing characteristics of completed work in a field fischer et al 2021 snyder 2019 through which we aim for making this review systematic and critical in its appraisal of existing conceptualizations and research approaches 3 2 article selection our review started with an article selection procedure the flowchart in fig 1 provides an overview of the entire article selection process we first identified all articles of which the title abstract or keywords suggest that both the concept of trust as well as the issue of water governance are captured using two scientific searching engines scopus and web of knowledge we searched for articles in which the term trust which also includes subsidiary terms such as distrust trustful and trustworthy appears in combination with either one of the terms water governance water management or water policy 1 1 we understand the concept of water governance in a broad sense so that it also refers to related but sometimes more stringently defined sub concepts such as water management and water policy making e g pahl wostl 2009 technically we used the following searching criteria topic title abs key trust and water governance or water management or water polic no time limitations have been set for the period from which we retain articles in january 2020 this search string obtained 500 articles that we subsequently subjected to a first screening round based on the titles and abstracts to identify and exclude off topic articles we excluded 115 articles that were mainly on the topics of trust funds public trust doctrines or articles with a technical focus from the natural sciences in which trust and water governance only incidentally appeared at the start of the second stage of our article selection process we obtained with assistance of the libraries of our institutions full text access to 374 of the 386 articles that we retained after step one we subjected those 374 articles to a second screening round now based on the full texts after which we eliminated another 66 articles from our list that were off topic or not written in english finally we checked how often the term trust or one of its derivatives appeared in the 308 remaining articles this check shows that in 30 5 of the 308 articles that we coded the word trust or one of its derivatives appears less than five times in other words trust only plays a very marginal role in those articles to focus our investigation about the role of trust in water governance to articles that deal substantially with the concept of trust we limited our main analyses to the 200 articles in which the term trust appears at least five times 2 2 we nevertheless coded the first thirteen questions from our protocol for the 108 articles in which trust appeared less than five times the results show that trust indeed hardly plays a role in those articles none of these articles comes up with a definition of trust neither does any of these articles adopt a conceptual distinction between different subtypes of trust 3 3 data extraction to analyze the 200 articles in our final sample we developed a coding protocol with coding instructions see online appendix a this protocol first covers questions to obtain basic article identification information this includes questions on the type of journals publishing the articles the dates of publication whether the article is empirical or conceptual and what sub issue s of water governance is are addressed to code the sub issues within the field of water governance we first had a team discussion in which we identified flood management drought management water quality management water distribution management and environmental conservation as the most likely sub categories of water governance practices we then coded to what extent the discussion in each article fitted into one or more of those categories or whether the issue should be classified as other we continued with a set of questions on the importance of trust in each article and its theoretical foundation subsequently we identify the subjects and objects of trust that are discussed in each article although the subjects and objects of trust are commonly easier to identify in the cases in which trust is empirically studied we also coded subjects of trust in cases in which they are only discussed in the more theoretical sections of articles furthermore we allowed multiple entries as several subjects objects of trust could simultaneously be discussed and thus coded in a single article some of the coded articles also use generic terms to refer to multiple subjects objects of trust at the same time such terms for example include inter actor trust stakeholder trust and network trust in cases that such generic terms appeared we always separately coded them as generic terms for several subjects objects of trust when articles went into further detail about the involved actors we additionally coded those more specific subjects of trust the next questions in the protocol ask about the geographic location and scale at which studies are performed and about the conclusions of the reviewed studies regarding the role of trust in water governance processes n 200 finally a last group of questions addresses how studies are performed and what methods have been used whereas the full sample of 200 articles contained many empirical articles n 164 we find that only a slight majority of 58 n 92 of the 164 empirical articles investigate the role of trust in water governance processes in their empirics as our interest is only in the design and methods of studies that address trust in their empirics we coded these methodological characteristics only for the sub sample of 92 articles that empirically address trust preliminary versions of the protocol have been tested and revised by several co authors all co authors agreed on the final version of the codebook and subsequently coded their subset of articles thirty seven articles were coded by two coders to determine intercoder agreement across non text based fields agreement of 80 or above was initially achieved across most of the variables with numerical answer categories reported in appendix a after discussions between the main coders a few variables have been re coded to reach this level of agreement questions that did not reach the 80 threshold level are not further discussed in our result section the remaining text based fields e g the definitions of trust and examples of causal directions have been used to qualitatively inform our analyses data is made available in the supplements to this article 4 results in this section we first present a descriptive overview of the 200 articles in our sample and report which sub issues of water governance are addressed by each article 4 1 next we show the spread of the sampled studies across geographies and scales 4 2 how trust is conceptualized 4 3 and what type of trust relations are most studied 4 4 finally we report how trust in water governance is empirically studied in the subset of 92 articles that contain such an analysis 4 5 to clearly distinguish between the articles in our sample our primary data and subsidiary literature used in this article we refer to articles from our sample with their id number in squared brackets online appendix b shows the bibliographical references belonging to these id numbers 4 1 trust in the water governance literature an emerging but dispersed field most of the 200 articles from our full dataset appeared in a broad selection of 106 different journals four articles appeared as conference proceedings while one article appeared as a book chapter individual journals which published five or more articles from our list are water 13 articles the international journal of water resources 8 articles environmental science and policy 8 articles ecology and society 6 articles the journal of environmental management 5 articles the journal of hydrology 5 articles and society and natural resources 5 articles a large majority of the 200 articles are empirical studies 82 we classified the other articles as theoretical review articles 13 5 policy analyses 1 5 case descriptions 1 or other 2 fig 2 shows that the number of annually published articles on trust in water governance is progressively increasing although the selected articles range over a time span from 1997 to 2019 only 20 of the 200 articles appeared before the year 2010 while 2018 has so far appeared as the most fruitful year with a total number of 31 published articles overall those findings reassert our initial impression that the trust in water governance literature is in rapid development the results presented in table 1 reveal that there is substantial variation in how often different thematic sub issues that fit under the generic label of water governance practices are addressed by the articles in our sample a large majority of 70 of the 200 articles only deal with a single water governance sub issue around 21 percent of the articles deal with two sub issues while 10 of the articles simultaneously address three or more sub issues of water governance the sub issues which are most addressed are water distribution addressed in 30 of all articles and water quality 29 5 other sub issues such as environmental conservation 15 5 flood management 12 and drought management 10 5 appear less frequently in the literature forty seven percent of all the articles include a substantive issue that could only be classified into the other water issues category interpretation of the text variable which describes those topics listed as other shows that several of those articles deal with issues of transboundary water governance or with water governance in a general sense 4 2 dominance of western geographies and studies at single scale the examination of the spread across geographies and scales revealed two main patterns first the dataset shows a clear dominance of studies that cover western geographies notably europe 22 of all the studies and north america 21 5 in addition most of the studies that cover oceania 12 are in fact from australia or new zealand in contrast there were relatively few studies from african 8 or latin american 6 5 countries table 2 we also find that studies from these continents and asia are cited less than half as many times as studies performed in western geographies table c2 in online appendix c recognizing the acuteness of water related issues in africa and latin america olagunju et al 2019 trimble et al 2021 this indicates a considerable mismatch in scholarly attention having said that we have to take into account that we focused on studies in english as such we have not included studies in spanish or french both important languages in the global south second a clear trend emerged in that studies tend to focus on a single geographical scale for instance 77 of the studies investigated water governance issues within a single country and 46 of the studies examined issues from a single region or watershed within a country only a limited number of the articles adopted cases based on a region or watershed that crosses international borders 8 5 or cross country comparative approaches based on comparing local 5 5 or regional 7 5 case studies from different countries tables 2 and 3 additional investigation of how the sub issues of water governance are spread over the different geographies that we distinguished reveal several interesting patterns in how the thematic focus of studies from different areas considerably varies table c7 in online appendix c trust in relation to flood management is for example typically studied in the european context half of all the articles on trust in flood management are from european cases flooding is not or hardly ever studied in relation to trust in studies that focus on africa latin america and oceania at the other hand the issue of drought management and trust is hardly studied in the european context which is surprising given the climatic trend of dryer and hotter summers in the continent which causes extensive problems for agriculture and water distribution grillakis 2019 studies on trust in relation to water quality issues most commonly appear in the north american context while the dominant focus in articles from asia and africa is on the issue of water distribution finally an important insight is that although trust in water related environmental conservation is often studied in the western context this sub issue is hardly ever studied in southern contexts africa asia latin america 4 3 limited conceptual clarity and an emphasis on the instrumental role of trust a key finding from our review is that overall the available body of research on trust in water governance suffers from limited conceptual clarity only 11 5 n 23 of the articles included an explicit definition of trust and of these only 16 articles offered a reference to clarify the proposed conceptualization two sources are cited more than once namely hardin 2002 and rousseau et al 1998 although only cited twice the definitions in nine articles ids 62 87 109 152 152 181 225 236 271 366 in essence come down to hardin s basic understanding of a trust relationship see section 2 in which a subject of trust a trusts the object b concerning matters x besides mentioning those three core components of a trust relationship none of the definitions of trust in the mentioned articles include the elements of context specificity and the dynamic nature timing of trust bauer and freitag 2018 lewicki et al 2006 however a few articles in fact do discuss the dynamic and context specific nature of trust see for example de vries et al 2017 id 87 marks and zadoroznyj 2005 id 234 but did not incorporate such notions in their definitions of trust overall our results show that the theoretical insights that trust relationships are often context specific and change over time bauer and freitag 2018 are only very marginally incorporated in the literature on trust in water governance in addition we find that half of the articles with explicit definitions of trust n 11 resonate with the view of rousseau et al 1998 that trust is a psychological state of a truster based upon positive expectations of the intentions or behavior of the trustee albeit only in two cases with a cited reference to rousseau ids 109 121 152 169 181 206 225 236 250 271 332 the other 12 articles that offer a definition of trust are neutral about what type of expectations trusters develop the article by cisneros 2019 p 29 id 62 for example simply states that trust is the expectation that an individual has of the behavior of other stakeholders in a collaborative partnership still this suggests that in those cases where trust is defined the emphasis is often times on its positive character a clear research question or goal related to trust appeared in only 17 n 33 of the 200 articles again further interpretation identified a clear pattern in that about half of these articles stated a question or goal wherein the reason to engage with trust is primarily motivated due to instrumental reasons i e enhancing trust is seen as a strategy to achieve other objectives olsen 2006 steen and rutgers 2011 which stands in contrast to for instance studies that focus on trust for its intrinsic value for example several articles focus on how to build trust in water governance practices e g ids 6 45 61 152 272 or how trust can increase the acceptance of certain water policies or technologies e g ids 11 111 120 233 234 367 the other half of the articles posed more descriptive questions without any explicit view on the presumed role of trust only 16 n 32 of the articles distinguish between different subtypes of trust the subtype of trust that is most commonly mentioned is institutional trust mostly to distinguish this type of trust from interpersonal trust ids 50 156 159 180 181 308 346 378 a few other articles apply a distinction between institutional trust and other more particular types of trust such as trust in actual officeholders administrations sometimes labelled as political trust ids 45 104 158 169 330 380 in addition only a few articles in the review actively mention but do commonly not operationalize and test a distinction between antecedent based subtypes of trust such as dispositional trust calculative trust and affinity based trust ids 104 117 181 225 236 271 276 366 in spite of the mentioned efforts to more extensively conceptualize trust overall our findings show that most articles deal with trust as a single umbrella concept that refers to various social relations and actors finally when assessing the conceptual clarity of articles within each of the different sub issues of water governance we find that the term trust on average appears significantly less often in articles on flood prevention and nature conservation than in articles on the other issues furthermore trust is hardly ever defined in the areas of drought management and water quality management and distinctions between subtypes of trust hardly ever occur in articles on flood management and drought prevention table c8 in online appendix c when comparing between continents we find that definitions of trust occur relative the least in papers on cases from north america asia and latin america subtypes of trust are the least distinguished in cases from asia oceania and latin america while research questions on trust appear less often in papers dealing with asian cases table c9 in online appendix c nevertheless we do not see a clear division between articles from northern and southern contexts when it comes to the conceptual clarity of the papers with regard to the geographical scales of the investigations we find that trust is less often defined in cross border and comparative papers than in case studies on the local regional or national scale cross border studies and comparative studies that focus on regions also lag behind when it comes to distinguishing subtypes of trust and adopting research questions involving trust table c10 in online appendix c 4 4 trust relations a focus on trust of the general public in government organizations while the articles in our sample exhibited considerable diversity regarding the trusters subjects and trustees objects under study table 4 and associated trust relations table 5 some patterns emerged trust that ordinary citizens hold is by far the most prevalent focus when it comes to the subjects of trust appears in 49 of the articles individual farmers 26 water managers 17 and individual government employees 16 are also in focus as subjects of trust at the level of collectively held trust orientations the entities that are most often discussed as trusters are local and national level government organizations 25 other collectively held trust orientations are less often studied it is noteworthy how social groups that tend to find themselves marginalized in water governance such as ethnic minorities and indigenous peoples e g hoogesteger 2012 wester et al 2003 are little represented as the subjects of trust in studies on the role of trust in water governance citizens or individual level actors appear in 22 of the articles as the object of trust this means that individuals are considerably less often studied as trustees than as trusters as objects of trust the articles that we coded primarily focus on trust in governmental organizations such as trust in local and regional governments 57 national level executive water management agencies 34 and national level government policy maker 33 other group level entities such as social groups 16 private companies firms 16 and ngos 20 also commonly appear as the object of trust interestingly only 3 of the articles paid attention to supranational government levels as objects of trust something we find surprising given the fact that many water related policies today are developed at supranational levels e g in the eu other objects of trust that rarely appear are trust in formal water management rules laws directives trust in water related knowledge facts is the last object of trust that is regularly mentioned 20 while trust in scientists receives little attention 5 we furthermore assessed how often particular subject object combinations appear to categorize the particular trust relations that are most commonly studied table 5 we find that by far the most prevalent focus is on trust of individual citizens in government agencies 55 mutual trust relations between non state affiliated actors at the group level socially defined groups private companies and ngo s and government organizations 28 trust of individual citizens in non state affiliated actors at the group level 22 and trust of individuals in other individuals 20 are also commonly addressed trust relations that are not so commonly studied are trust between different non state affiliated group level actors 15 trust of government organizations in other government organizations 12 and finally trust between nation states 6 we also note a considerable diversity in the literature when it comes to the number of specific trust relationships that are addressed in the articles a first type of article takes a broad approach by focusing on multiple reciprocal trust relations between a set of different subjects and objects of trust several of those articles 15 of all articles do not explicitly describe the particular subjects and objects of trust but rely upon more generic and also more imprecise terms such as inter agency trust stakeholder trust or network trust to refer to the entire set of trust relations in multi actor constellations among the articles that do not adopt such generic terms we still find several articles that in fact address multiple i e more than one subjects 50 or objects 59 of trust on the other hand there is also a sizeable set of articles 41 with a focus on a single unidirectional trust relation that only addresses the trust of a particular truster in a single type of trustee additionally we find substantial variation in the specific trust relations and the various subjects and objects of trust when separately investigating those relations within the thematic sub issues of water governance the most notable findings regarding the subjects of trust are that individual citizens are highly prevalent in the sub issue of water quality management 64 while they are comparatively understudied in the subfield of drought management 14 farmers as the subject of trust are relatively important in the fields of drought management 29 and water distribution 35 while water managers often appear in most sub issues except for drought management 10 and water quality management 7 indigenous populations and other non indigenous minority groups do seldom play a role as subjects of trust and when they do they mainly play a role in the issue of nature conservation in 13 of the articles on this issue another finding is that individuals as the object of trust are less prominent than as the subject of trust individual actors as objects of trust do not appear very often in the sub issues of drought management 14 water quality management 14 and nature conservation 10 furthermore social groups as the object of trust are marginally studied in drought management civil society as the object of trust most commonly appears in the issue areas of flooding 29 and nature conservation 29 supra national governments as the objects of trust are only discussed in the issue areas of flooding water quality management and nature conservation for the particular trust relations specific subject object combinations we find that trust of individual trusters in individual trustees is relatively understudied within the sub issues of water quality management 9 and nature conservation 13 relations between individuals and non state affiliated groups get above average attention in the subfield of water quality management 24 while they are understudied in the subfield of drought management 10 trust of individual citizens in governmental actors individual officeholders as well as institutions is particularly well studied for the issues of water quality management 58 and nature conservation 54 relations between nation states are comparatively often studied in the fields of flooding 13 and droughts 14 while within the other subfields the percentages are below 7 4 5 trust empirically studied emphasis on trust as explanatory variable among the 92 articles that include an empirical assessment of the role of trust in water governance the majority comprise of case study approaches 58 written surveys 55 and oral interviews 51 are the most adopted data collection methods there was an almost even spread across quantitative 34 and qualitative 27 analyses with a large part also combining qualitative and quantitative methods 38 in terms of measuring the concept of trust most of the studies posed questions that directly ask about a subject s level of trust 70 yet a substantial number of 18 of the articles investigated trust by means of related concepts such as satisfaction id 61 the absence of conflicts id 15 the willingness to co operate id 1 or legitimacy id 140 for 12 of the articles that included an empirical assessment of trust there was no account of how trust was actually measured overall this shows that trust is in about a third of the articles not unequivocally operationalized which should be considered when assessing whether the findings on trust are valid moreover we find that a large majority of the empirical findings on trust are centered on directional claims 92 namely that trust explains or is explained by several other variables with which trust is associated table 6 a few articles 8 only report levels of trust as a result of an empirical investigation in line with our earlier observation in section 4 3 about the oftentimes presumed instrumental role of trust our review of the directionality of the empirically assessed trust claims points at an emphasis on trust as an explanatory variable 52 i e as a variable that positively affects other water governance related outcomes of primary concern such as participation and cooperation with projects and policies ids 81 88 128 132 180 253 291 293 330 346 351 354 376 behavioral adaptations such as drinking desalinated water or water usage habits ids 61 133 235 238 272 289 adoption of environmental friendly water related techniques ids 3 92 158 246 261 340 344 355 improved communication or social learning ids 62 201 269 about one fifth of the studies focus on trust as an outcome 18 5 identified variables that positively and or negatively affect trust include the structural and social complexities of water governance issues ids 1 8 9 157 234 236 353 339 levels of stakeholder involvement and collaborative efforts ids 1 45 56 336 information procession and message framing ids 121 130 234 236 332 339 361 381 and attitudes to risk ids 104 116 fourteen articles 15 investigate trust as both an outcome and an explanatory variable in their empirical analyses hurlimann id 162 for example simultaneously looks at the effect of the accurateness of information on trust in water recycling and the effect of trust on risk perceptions finally another nine 10 of the articles with directional claims deal with trust as a mediator moderator intermediate variable nancarrow leviston porter and tucker id 262 for example did not find a direct effect of trust on intended behaviors but they found an indirect effect of trust due to its mediating role in the relation between risk assessments and behavioral intentions while we did not conduct any systematic quality assurance we did investigate how the claims about trust were substantiated in the 92 studies we find that quite a large number of 69 75 of the 92 articles demonstrate their main claim on the role of trust both with references to the existing literature as well as by means of their empirical analyses on trust a smaller number of 16 17 of the 92 articles only rely on empirical findings to support their claims on trust this level of substantiation in those 92 articles stands in strong contrast with the substantiation of the claims on trust in the 108 articles from the entire set of 200 articles that did not empirically investigate trust in this latter group claims on trust are only supported by means of references to existing literature or not substantiated at all this resonates with further comparisons of these groups most notably that the level of conceptual clarity on trust is relatively better developed although still often limited in the 92 articles that contain empirical analyses involving trust 5 discussion the research that elucidates the concept of trust and its importance in the context of water governance has expanded considerably since the early 1990s with 80 of all articles on the subject having appeared since 2010 nevertheless our review revealed that the overall knowledge base has remained fragmented which is in line with statements made about the state of the broader water governance literature as well e g pahl wostl 2015 2012 trust is a multi dimensional concept that scholars have explored from very different angles using different approaches this makes it difficult to integrate different insights and to develop an all encompassing theory of trust in water governance although diversity can also mean an enrichment of the literature it currently mainly reflects the elusive nature of trust and hence the challenges of advancing the theoretical and empirical understanding of trust the papers included in this literature review show that trust is a key issue in many water governance practices yet understanding its exact role and functioning and developing integrated knowledge on how to understand trust in water governance requires more research in the sections below we more thoroughly reflect upon the main findings of our systematic literature review and connect these to recommendations for advancing future research on trust in the field of water governance finally we discuss the limitations of our own study and end the article with a few concluding remarks 5 1 discussion of the main findings in relation to future research needs 5 1 1 don t neglect the extant conceptualization problem our review generally corroborates the claim that trust is poorly conceptualized in water governance research with respect to our set of conceptual criteria on definitions research questions goals and subtypes of trust we find that a vast majority 89 of studies in our sample use the term trust without adopting any explicit statements that define trust moreover among the small group of articles that do in fact define trust there is considerable diversity in conceptualizing trust as was expected by davenport et al 2007 lijeblad et al 2009 pahl wostl 2015 stern and coleman 2015 only a dozen studies clearly acknowledge the relational nature of trust while context specific and or dynamic elements of trust are not mentioned at all in any of the definitional statements on trust notwithstanding we observed a few occasions in which those elements are discussed in theoretical sections of papers e g de vries et al 2017 id 87 marks and zadoroznyj 2005 id 234 altogether these findings show that studies on trust in water governance are falling behind on some of the current developments in the broader literature on trust bauer and freitag 2018 lewicki et al 2006 future progress first requires that more studies define and conceptualize trust second to provide more complete assessments of trust relationships we recommend studies to keep up with the broader literature on trust and the broader water governance literature by means of clearly acknowledging and empirically uncovering the context specific and dynamic nature of trust relationships see also lubell 2007 id 225 in addition our review also shows that only a very selective number of articles incorporate the concept of trust into their stated research questions although for some articles this may result from trust only being a concept of subsidiary concern for other papers in our sample i e those papers in which trust in fact plays a major role this suggests that more careful attention could be given to the concept of trust in the framing of research goals and questions notably most studies tend to assess trust as an umbrella term rather than looking at its different dimensions stern and coleman 2015 hence the lack of more extensively developed trust frameworks limits the ability to understand these different dimensions of trust how they relate to each other and how they affect or are affected by other aspects of water governance pahl wostl 2015 reiersen 2019 we advise future studies to rely upon more extensively developed trust frameworks so that the effects of trust can be empirically assessed and understood with regard to some of its component parts such approaches may follow the lead of some of the articles that we consider as good practice examples such as lubell s 2007 id 225 study that assesses the independent effects of different types of generalized trust on trust in specific water policies onencan et al s 2018 id 271 study that distinguishes between dis trust and trustworthiness in a game based approach to model cooperation in shared river basin collective action problems or jorgensen et al s 2009 id 181 investigation of the interplay between institutional trust and inter personal trust in explaining water use behavior 5 1 2 pick up on the understudied role of trust in several sub issue geography combinations water governance studies have mostly focused on the role of trust in issues such as water distribution especially papers on water distribution for agricultural use and water quality predominantly articles on public opinion on drinking water provision we found that considerably less attention has been paid to the role of trust in issues such as environmental conservation flood management and drought management in terms of geographical locations on which extant studies have focused we most prominently find that little research has yet been conducted on the role of trust in water governance in the global south africa asia latin america although one might argue that some of these latter issues simply appear less often especially in the context of the global south and that the role of trust is also less relevant in these issues contexts we would argue that this is not necessarily the case and that the role of trust in water governance practices is understudied in the global south specifically for specific sub issue geography combinations there are several examples of highly relevant water related issues from within these contexts that need to be governed in settings that require trust a few examples include the recent water crisis in the city of cape town maxmen 2018 massive flooding events in mozambique malawi and zimbabwe charrua et al 2021 and the life threatening droughts in eastern africa gebremeskel haile et al 2019 in the context of the global south our review shows that more attention could particularly be paid to the role of trust in issues of flood prevention and environmental conservation which are issues that despite their common occurrence and relevance in these contexts are hardly ever studied in combination with trust in the northern especially european context on the other hand studies on the role of trust in drought management are currently underexplored finally the findings on the geographical scales of studies suggest a need for more studies with a multi level international focus and studies that for example compare a set of local or regional case studies from different contexts and or countries given the numerous water governance issues that extent borders studies that go beyond a single national case are surprisingly scarce as the role of trust and the causal mechanisms associated with trust might well be different in these understudied contexts we might miss out on several important theoretical insights which makes paying more attention to these contexts all the more important 5 1 3 towards a larger diversity of the subjects objects of trust in line with the fragmented nature of the field of water governance itself in which numerous actors are involved in several different issues e g lubell and lippert 2011 id 223 woodhouse and muller 2017 we find a considerable diversity regarding the trusters subjects and trustees objects that are discussed by the entire set of studies overall one can see two different streams in the literature one focusing on public trust in government and water managers and the other focusing on trust between various collaborating actors within water governance both have a distinct focus and their own approach yet both write about trust and therefore some confusion can arise the more traditional actors within water governance processes receive most of the scholarly attention governments at the local regional and national scale and specific water management organizations are the most common objects of trust in the studies in our sample it could be relevant to extent this focus to the international level and analyze how different forms of trust impact the possibilities for the formulation and adaption of international policies as well as how trust plays a role in their implementation that we also identified trust in water related knowledge as one of the central objects of trust speaks to the importance of such knowledge in relation to legitimizing actions and enhancing credibility of specific actors e g mase et al 2015 id 236 medema et al 2014 id 256 the general public individual citizens most often appears as the subject of trust much less attention is paid to how trust levels differ between groups within society while the experiences and trust development of marginalized groups in societies including ethnic minorities and indigenous peoples hardly gain attention in addition given the scale of some of the water related challenges that water governance faces supranational government levels as objects of trust also deserve more scholarly attention in terms of subject object combinations more attention is required to studies that look at trust relations between different non state affiliated group level actors trust of government organizations in other government organizations and finally trust between nation states in addition the relation between trust in governments and trust between actors involved in collaborative networks requires more attention as participatory and collaborative processes are often initiated to enhance trust in government both concern different dimensions of trust and drawing on the literature little is known about how these relate to each other finally we identified a substantial subgroup of articles that rely upon generic terms to indicate trust relationships such as inter agency trust stakeholder trust or network trust however several of these articles do not specify who the particular stakeholders and or actors are who participate in such networks to be able to more precisely understand how overall network performances are affected by the trust relations between its members we recommend future studies to more clearly identify the involved subjects and objects of trust in networks and to more completely assess such trust relations see for example hickey et al 2021 song et al 2017 5 1 4 going beyond instrumentally motivated reasons to studying trust although it is theoretically expected that trust may manifest itself as a predictor as well as an outcome of water governance processes edelenbos and van meerkerk 2015 klijn et al 2010 stern and coleman 2015 our findings show that the extant literature particularly focusses on approaching trust as an explanatory variable this focus on trust as an explanatory variable comes together with a tendency in several of the articles that we analysed to assume that trust is an attitude which comes with positive consequences for establishing sustainable long term cooperation in water governance processes that require collective action hamm et al 2013 lafuente et al 2018 id 206 lubell 2007 id 225 stern and baird 2015 van meerkerk and edelenbos 2014 a textual analysis of the articles with stated research questions goals and of the content of the directional claims that have been made on trust further revealed the omnipresence of instrumentally motivated reasons to engage with trust for example half of the articles with a clearly specified research question or goal related to trust already state in their introduction sections that they are mainly interested in seeking out how trust can increase acceptance of specific policies governance practices or technologies although not necessarily a problem in all cases we agree with authors that argue that an overtly instrumental focus on trust can obscure the importance of trust building as an end in itself rutgers and schreurs 2006 steen and rutgers 2011 when there is no up front commitment to the process of trust building itself collaborative processes may very well backfire into a loss of trust in case of any unwanted negative outcomes of the practices that initially needed trust to be established ansell and gash 2007 hence we recommend paying more attention to trust as an intrinsically valuable outcome of water governance processes from an empirical perspective we do not dispute that trust in several occasions may indeed play the presumed positive role we found many examples of papers that report positive effects of trust on collective action and collaboration e g baldwin et al 2018 id 17 hoogesteger 2013 id 153 jorgensen et al 2009 id 181 nevertheless the results of our review warrant that we should question the validity and reliability of the knowledge base behind many of such findings and the relevance of such statements many of the claims on trust in water governance are not empirically assessed and in cases in which they are a poor conceptualization of trust in combination with methodological problems to assess trust undermines the validity of discussions on trust furthermore among the articles that did empirically assess the role of trust in water governance some of them in fact suggest that the positive effects of trust may be overrated as cooperation can under certain conditions occur without trust satein and weber 2018 id 308 and higher trust does not always increase actors willingness to contribute to environmental common goods e g franzen et al 2016 id 120 hanemann 2014 id 139 in addition trust building is not always a relevant result of stakeholder involvement processes e g al adwan and hayek 2011 id 5 buchecker et al 2013 id 45 finally our results also raise the question of whether the assumed beneficial effects of trust equally apply to all types of trusters and trustees for example as we have argued above minorities and indigenous groups are scarcely represented as subjects of trust this is a significant finding since individuals from these groups also tend to find themselves marginalized in water governance e g hoogesteger 2012 wester et al 2003 5 1 5 embrace methodological diversity our finding that the majority of the empirical assessments on the role of trust in water governance comprise of individual case study approaches is not surprising given that individual case studies abound in the larger water governance literature pahl wostl 2015 to capture more of the complexities of water governance processes we advocate that comparative approaches are more often adopted e g pahl wostl and lebel 2011 such approaches may consist of or combine exploratory analyses that look at a large number of variables from multiple cases or and in depth studies of selected cases that focus on a reduced number of variables only pahl wostl 2015 p 198 there is also a need for more studies with an international focus and for comparative studies that compare a set of local or regional case studies from different contexts and or countries furthermore although we endorse the substantial variation that exists when it comes to the methods of data collection analyses we observed that participatory methods are hardly applied in the field 5 2 limitations of our systematic review approach there are some methodological limitations of our review approach given our searching procedure we may have missed some unidentified gray literature on trust in water governance as well as non english publications nevertheless we are confident that the sample of articles that we analyzed is representative for the most substantial part of the trust in water governance literature as we coded the full collection of english language academic articles on the topic furthermore some of the protocol development coding and interpretation of the findings was informed by the prior experiences and knowledge that our international group of authors brought to this project although such prior knowledge is inevitable in research and an requirement to guide the methodological process of developing and performing the review it also means that some of the categorizations and interpretations remain selective and non exhaustive fischer et al 2021 finally our choice of focusing on articles that mention the term trust or one if its derivatives at least five times indicates only a modest criteria for inclusion in the review although this choice fitted well with our aim of providing an overview of the way in which trust is discussed in the broader water governance literature it could be argued that future work needs to focus more particularly on a smaller set of studies in which trust is the core concept of the contribution there are also some limitations in terms of potentially relevant content that we did not assess for example a need to broaden our knowledge base may be warranted when it comes to understanding how diverse governance contexts affect the role of trust in more particular water governance issues generalized trust in government institutions and more particular direct trust in stakeholders in water governance issues are only sparingly distinguished from each other and their interrelation barely studied furthermore we could also have assessed more fully the uncritical extrapolation of findings on trust from singular studies that do not recognize the role of contextual variables such as political history governance situation and power relations 6 concluding remarks this systematic literature review has presented an overview of the way in which water governance literature engages with trust as a conceptual lens analytical device and empirical phenomenon the review revealed that the current knowledge base on the role of trust in water governance is fragmented lacks conceptual clarity and is contextually dispersed this state of the literature makes attempts to synthesize towards a sophisticated understanding of the role of trust in the field of water governance difficult if not impossible e g srinivasan et al 2012 woodhouse and muller 2017 a key insight from our review is that future research would contribute towards a more comprehensive and useful understanding of trust in water governance by applying definitions and conceptualizations of trust that clearly acknowledge the context specific and dynamic nature of trust relationships by relying on clear and transparent conceptualizations it is possible to empirically assess various aspects of trust including factors that influence it its possible effects as well as the relationships between subjects and objects of trust we thus foresee that future research could provide relevant and comparable knowledge on trust in water governance within the boundaries of well specified context conditions i e similarity between issues geographies comparable conceptualizations of trust and a focus on similar subject object combinations the analysis and information provided by our review should be of practical relevance for such a research effort since our database and appendices make it possible to identify studies with similarities in terms of the involved conditions contexts and subject object combinations of particular trust relations which enhances the possibilities of context specific comparisons and comparable empirical work a final take home message for researchers and practitioners in the field is to critically assess the role and function of trust in water governance and not assume that it will automatically play a positive role since we found limited well grounded empirical research supporting such claims declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the european commission

19922,with stringent effluent requirements and the implementation of new processes for micropollutant removal it is increasingly important for wastewater treatment plants wwtps to understand the factors affecting effluent quality phages viruses infecting prokaryotes are abundant in the biological treatment processes they can contribute to organic carbon in the treated effluent both because they are organic in nature and occur in the effluent and because they cause lysis of microorganisms today very little is known about the effects of phages on effluent quality the goal of this study was therefore to determine the relationship between phages and organic carbon in wwtp effluents we also examined the diversity taxonomy and host association of dna phages using metagenomics effluent samples were collected from four wwtps treating municipal wastewater significant differences in both organic carbon and virus like particle concentrations were observed between the plants and there was a linear relationship between the two parameters the phage communities were diverse with many members being taxonomically unclassified putative hosts were dominated by bacteria known to be abundant in activated sludge systems such as comamonadaceae the composition of phages differed between the wwtps suggesting that local conditions shape the communities overall our findings suggest that the abundance and composition of phages are related to effluent quality thus there is a need for further research clarifying the association between phage dynamics and wwtp function keywords activated sludge bacteriophages metaviromics microbial ecology tertiary treatment introduction most municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps rely on biological processes both suspended growth processes such as activated sludge and biofilm processes such a moving bed biofilm reactors and trickling filters are commonly used these biological reactors contain high numbers of microorganisms that treat the wastewater by removing organic compounds nitrogen and phosphorus the prokaryotic communities in wwtps have been investigated in many studies e g wu et al 2019 yang et al 2011 but the viral communities are less explored phages i e viruses that infect prokaryotes are the most abundant living entities on earth clokie et al 2011 their life cycle includes adsorption and injection of nucleic acids into the host replication using the host cell s molecular machinery and assembly of virus particles virions which are released into the environment to infect other cells lytic phages immediately start to replicate inside the host cell whereas lysogenic phages integrate into the host cell s genome and remain there until their lytic cycle is activated weinbauer 2004 as phages are dependent on host cells to replicate we can expect to find phages wherever prokaryotes are found dennehy and abedon 2021 often phages outnumber prokaryotic cells by an order of magnitude although there is a large variation in the phage to prokaryote ratio between different environments parikka et al 2017 since there are high concentrations of prokaryotes in wastewater treatment processes we can expect to find high concentrations of phages there as well shapiro and kushmaro 2011 indeed previous studies enumerating phage particles in wwtps have found that biological treatment processes have high concentrations otawa et al 2007 typically activated sludge and anaerobic digesters have higher phage particle concentrations than the influent and effluent wastewater brown et al 2019 wu and liu 2009 brown et al 2019 found higher concentrations in the effluent than the influent suggesting that a production of phage particles in the biological reactors leads to a net increase in the wastewater as it moves through a wwtp phages are believed to have a strong influence on the microbial community composition and ecosystem function in wastewater treatment processes but we still know relatively little about their effects brown et al 2019 there are examples where phages have been associated with changes in bioreactor performance for example barr et al 2010 hypothesized that phage infection of candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis was responsible for a decline in the performance of biological phosphorus removal in laboratory scale sequencing batch reactors liu et al 2017 found a decline of nitrifying bacteria corresponding to an increase of phages associated with these bacteria in bulking sludge phage infections can potentially affect the concentration of organic compounds in effluent wastewater lysis of host cells leads to release of organic compounds middelboe et al 1996 some of these organics are immediately used as substrates by other microorganisms rosenberg et al 2010 while others may be more recalcitrant and remain in the effluent in other environments such as the oceans phage induced lysis of microorganisms is known to contribute to the pool of dissolved organic matter breitbart et al 2018 suttle 2005 the phage particles themselves are also organic and although they are small the capsid size of caudovirales members is typically 45 185 nm in diameter dion et al 2020 high concentrations in the water could potentially make a noticeable contribution to the organic carbon concentration today it is becoming increasingly important for wwtps to reach low concentrations of organic carbon in their effluent this is driven both by tougher regulations on effluent biochemical oxygen demand and by prospective implementation of new technologies such as ozonation and activated carbon adsorption for removal of micropollutants for example both the required ozone dose and the lifetime of activated carbon filters depend on the organic carbon concentration in the water boehler et al 2012 nöthe et al 2009 rizzo et al 2019 a small increase in organic carbon concentration can thus lead to increased resource consumption and costs at the treatment plant it is therefore important to understand the causes of variations in effluent organic carbon concentrations phage activity could be one important cause which we currently know very little about thus the goal of this study was to determine the relationship between phage particles and organic carbon concentrations in the effluent of wwtps and to examine the phage communities using metagenomics materials and methods wastewater treatment plants and sampling for analysis of concentrations of organic carbon and phage particles 24 h flow proportional samples were collected from four swedish wwtps treating municipal wastewater see process schemes in fig s1 supplementary material for plant a b and c samples were collected in may 2017 for plant d samples were collected from june to december 2017 samples were stored in plastic containers at a temperature of 4 c until analysis plant a has pre precipitation in settling tanks followed by a high loaded activated sludge process the settled effluent from the activated sludge is partly recycled over nitrifying trickling filters to anoxic zones in the inlet of the activated sludge tanks another part of the secondary effluent flows though nitrifying and denitrifying moving bed biofilm reactors mbbrs methanol is added for the post denitrification step the final effluent is filtered through 15 µm pore size disk filters before discharge the average inflow to the wwtp was 4 4 m3 s 1 and the 7 days biochemical oxygen demand bod7 was 170 mg l the sludge age was 4 6 d and the organic load to the activated sludge was 0 30 kg bod7 kg 1 suspended solids d 1 plant b has pre precipitation in settling tanks followed by a high loaded activated sludge process the settled activated sludge effluent flows through a nitrifying trickling filter followed by post denitrification in methanol fed mbbrs this is followed by dissolved air flotation with the possibility of adding precipitation chemicals the average inflow to the wwtp was 1 2 m3 s 1 and the bod7 was 225 mg l the sludge age was 2 9 d and the organic load was 0 42 kg bod7 kg 1 suspended solids d 1 plant c has primary settling followed by a low loaded activated sludge process with nitrification and pre denitrification this is followed by chemical treatment and sedimentation the final effluent is further treated in a pond system the average inflow to the wwtp was 0 38 m3 s 1 and the bod7 208 mg l the sludge age was 7 21 days and the organic load was 0 058 kg bod7 kg 1 suspended solids d 1 plant d has an activated sludge process with nitrification and pre denitrification in parallel with an activated sludge process using sequencing batch reactors sbrs process the effluent from both these processes go to chemical treatment with dosage of aluminum chloride and final settling about 10 of the effluent was treated in a pilot scale ultrafiltration uf unit with a nominal pore size of 0 02 µm and a granular activated carbon gac filter unit with an empty bed contact time ebct of 19 min on average the total average wastewater inflow was 0 20 m3 s 1 and the bod7 was 290 mg l the sludge age was 9 d in the activated sludge and 14 d in the sbrs the organic load was 0 87 kg bod7 kg 1 suspended solids d 1 where 55 was treated in the activated sludge process and 45 in the sbrs samples for analysis of organic carbon and phage particles were collected from the final effluent in all wwtps in plant c and d samples were collected both after the conventional treatment processes and after tertiary treatment with ponds plant c or uf and gac plant d samples for metagenomics were collected from plants a b and c grab samples collected on three days a month apart were analyzed from plant a one 24 h flow proportional sample each was analyzed from plant b and c after the conventional treatment processes analytical methods the collected samples were filtered through 0 45 µm pore size polyethylene sulfone filters before analysis the organic carbon concentration of the filtered samples was analyzed with a toc analyzer toc v shimadzu this fraction of the organic carbon content in water is conventionally referred to as dissolved organic carbon doc although it contains a mix of truly dissolved and colloidal substances such as phage particles therefore we use the acronym doc for the organic carbon concentrations measured in the study the concentration and size distribution of phage particles were analyzed using nanoparticle tracking analysis nta nanosight ns 300 malvern in nta a laser is used to visualize individual particles in a water sample and a video of the particles is recorded the particle concentration is calculated based on the number of identified particles the hydrodynamic diameters of the particles are calculated based on the brownian motion observed in the videos we determined phage concentrations and size distributions using at least three to five 30 s videos of each sample nta has previously been used to measure phages and adenoviruses in water anderson et al 2011 kramberger et al 2012 it has also been compared to other techniques such as the plaque assay which is the standard way of analyzing concentrations of infectious phages and viruses we also made this comparison using p1 phages text s1 supplementary material the ratio between total virion concentrations measured with nta and the infectious phage concentrations measured as plaque forming units pfu was 12 8 which is in line with previous observations anderson et al 2011 du et al 2010 we also confirmed that the observed particles in wwtp effluents were indeed phages by staining them with sybr gold the sybr gold nucleic acid stain concentrate in dmso thermofisher was diluted 50 times in tris edta buffer ph 7 4 supelco and 25 µl of the dilution was added to 10 ml effluent wastewater resulting in a 20 000 times dilution of the original sybr gold stock solution the mixture was heated at 80 c for 10 min and allowed to cool to room temperature then nta was carried out with a blue laser 488 nm the instrument was equipped with a 500 nm light filter which can be inserted in the light path without the filter all particles can be observed with the filter in the light path only particles stained with sybr gold can be observed the stain rapidly bleached when exposed to the laser which meant only a few seconds long videos could be recorded and hydrodynamic diameters could not be determined therefore dna staining was only carried out on a few samples to confirm that the observed particles were indeed phages see video s1 supplementary material while quantification was done without sybr gold examples of still images of stained and unstained samples are shown in fig 1 we refer to the particles quantified with nta as virus like particles vlp to determine the contribution of vlp to the doc concentration a zinc hydroxide precipitation method was used to remove the fine particles from the water mamais et al 1993 for the samples from plant d this was also compared to measuring the doc concentration in samples collected before and after the ultrafiltration step metagenomics the five samples for metagenomics were filtered through 0 2 µm pore size polyethylene sulfone filters the vlp were concentrated using amicon ultra 15 centrifugal filters with a molecular weight cutoff of 100 kda millipore approximately 50 100 ml sample volume was concentrated to 1 ml to remove extracellular dna 10 µl 20 u of dnase i invitrogen was added to the 1 ml concentrate it was incubated at room temperature for 15 min and thereafter the dnase was inactivated at 75 c for 5 min phage dna was then extracted from the samples using norgen s phage dna isolation kit norgen biotek following the manufacturer s instructions dna fragmentation was performed using a covaris e220 system targeting an insert size of 350 400 bp library preparation was carried out using the smarter thruplex dna seq kit takara paired end 151 bp sequencing was done using a novaseq 6000 system sp flow cell and v1 sequencing chemistry illumina the raw sequence reads are deposited at the european nucleotide archive under project number prjeb50470 the raw sequence reads were quality filtered using fastp v0 20 0 chen et al 2018 the coverage was normalized to a target depth of 100 and a minimum depth of 2 using bbnorm v38 61 https sourceforge net projects bbmap then contigs were assembled individually from each sample using spades v3 15 3 with the setting metaviral antipov et al 2020 checkv v0 8 1 was used to determine whether the contigs represented viral genomes nayfach et al 2021 all contigs with at least one viral gene and more than twice as many viral genes than host genes were retained the relative abundances of the contigs in each sample were determined by mapping the quality filtered reads to the phage contigs using coverm https github com wwood coverm with bwa mem v0 7 17 vasimuddin et al 2019 as mapper for a contig to be considered present in a sample at least 80 of its nucleotides had to have a coverage exceeding one taxonomic classification of the phage contigs was done using phagcn with default settings shang et al 2021 potential hosts of the phages were identified using two methods in the first method we mapped the phage contigs against the crispr spacer database of crispropendb dion et al 2021 in the second we used anvio v7 eren et al 2021 to taxonomically classify trna sequences in the phage contigs in anvio trnascan se is used for identification of trna sequences chan and lowe 2019 the results from the two methods were combined and the phage host associations were visualized using circos krzywinski et al 2009 the presence and function of auxiliary metabolic genes in the phage genomes was determined in anvio using the function anvi estimate metabolism genes were predicted using prodigal v2 6 3 hyatt et al 2010 gene functions were determined by matching the genes to kegg orthologs using the kofam database aramaki et al 2020 the genes were then categorized into metabolic pathways as defined by kegg modules muto et al 2013 statistical methods to determine differences in vlp concentration doc concentrations and particle sizes between wwtps levene s test for equal variances was first carried out then a one way anova was done to determine if statistically significant differences existed finally tukey s honest significant difference hsd post hoc test was done for pairwise comparisons the levene and anova tests were done using scipy virtanen et al 2020 and tukey s hsd was done using statsmodels seabold and perktold 2010 correlation between parameters was examined using ordinary linear regression in statsmodels diversity was calculated as the hill number of diversity order 1 1d jost 2006 this diversity index weighs each phage contig according to its relative abundance in the sample and the index can therefore be interpreted as the number of phage contigs that are common in the sample pielou s evenness index pielou 1966 was used to quantify the distribution of phage contigs detected in a sample the index ranges from 0 to 1 and a high value means that all detected contigs have similar relative abundance in the sample i e high evenness the difference in phage composition between samples was calculated as hill based dissimilarity of diversity order 1 this index ranges from 0 to 1 and can be interpreted as the fraction of common phage contigs not shared between pairs of samples diversity indices and principal coordinate analysis pcoa were calculated using qdiv modin et al 2020 results the concentrations of vlp and doc were different in the four wwtps in fig 2 the concentrations of doc and vlp and the sizes of the vlp in the four wwtps are shown there were significantly different concentrations of effluent doc between wwtps p 4 10 6 anova these ranged from 7 1 0 6 mg l 1 average standard deviation n 7 for plant c to 14 7 3 0 mg l 1

concentration ranging from 3 8 0 7 109 vlp ml 1 in plant c to 7 3 3 3 109 vlp ml 1 in plant d pairwise comparisons showed that plant c had significantly lower concentrations than plant a and d p 0 02 tukey s hsd no significant difference in the mean and mode of the vlp diameters between the wwtps was observed the vlp size distribution is also shown in fig s2 supplementary material the mode of the size distribution was between 90 5 nm in plant c and 102 22 nm in plant d there was a linear correlation between vlp and doc concentrations using linear regression the correlation between doc and vlp

particles from the water using a flocculation method and then measure the doc and vlp concentrations again fig 3ii the reduction in doc concentration after flocculation was between 22 4 average standard deviation n 7 in plant a and 30 6 n 2 in plant d the reduction in vlp concentration ranged from 88 5 in plant a to 99 1 in plant b n 7 the reduction in doc was correlated with the reduction in vlp r2 adj 0 73 p 0 001 and the slope of the regression line was 0 54 0 15 10 12 mg doc vlp 1 95 confidence interval there was also a linear correlation for all plants individually with pearson s r ranging from 0 45 to 0 93 although the correlations were only significant for plants a and c fig s4 supplementary material as plant d was equipped with a uf unit with a cutoff of 0 02 µm this provided an alternative way of analyzing the contribution of vlp to doc the doc concentrations dropped from 14 7 2 6 to 13 0 2 4 mg l 1 corresponding to a reduction of 11 3 2 6 the vlp concentrations dropped from 7 3 2 8 109 to 0 022 0 004 109 vlp ml 1 corresponding to a reduction of 99 7 0 1 n 4 for these four samples no statistically significant linear correlation could be determined but the ratio between changes in doc and vlp was 0 24 0 07 10 12 mg doc vlp 1 average standard deviation n 4 tertiary treatment had varying effects on the doc and vlp concentrations plant c was equipped with a pond system as tertiary treatment before the effluent was discharged as water flowed through the ponds the doc concentration decreased by 9 11 from 7 1 0 5 mg l 1 to 6 4 0 4 mg l 1 average standard deviation n 5 the vlp concentration on the other hand decreased by 75 4 from 3 8 0 7 109 vlp ml 1 to 0 96 0 23 109 vlp ml 1 there was no change in the size distribution of vlps fig s5 supplementary material plant d was equipped with a uf unit followed by gac filter unit as mentioned above the uf removed 99 7 0 1 of the vlp and 11 3 2 6 of the doc the following gac filtration led to a decrease in the doc concentration by 14 9 from 13 0 2 4 mg l 1 to 11 0 1 3 mg l 1 the vlp concentration increased across the gac filter from 0 02 0 004 109 vlp ml 1 to 0 14 0 04 109 vlp ml 1 phage communities from different wwtps had different composition the bioinformatics resulted in 366 phage contigs out of which 106 were classified as complete phage genomes while 43 73 and 143 were classified a high medium and low quality genomes respectively by checkv the phage communities had similar alpha diversity and evenness fig 4 i ii for beta diversity the three samples from plant a clustered suggesting they had similar composition in comparison to the samples from the other two wwtps fig 4iii a difference in composition between samples from different plants was also seen in the analysis of auxiliary metabolic genes in the viral contigs fig 5 these are genes that encode various metabolic functions in the host cells breitbart et al 2018 the sample from plant a had an even distribution between genes associated with nucleotide and amino acid metabolism in plant b metabolism of co factors and vitamins dominated while amino acid metabolism dominated in plant c putative viral hosts were diverse putative associations between phages and hosts are shown in fig 6 among phage classifications siphoviridae myoviridae and podoviridae were the most common many contigs were also unclassified phages out of the 366 phage contigs 70 could be linked to a putative host comamonadaceae pseudomonadaceae rhodocyclaceae and burkholderiaceae were the most common host affiliations represented by 9 6 6 and 5 contigs respectively there were 20 phage contigs that could be detected in all five samples most of the contigs in this core community were unclassified and only one a siphoviridae had a host link to a pseudomonadaceae sp the most common host affiliation that could be observed in all five samples were comamonadaceae pseudomonadaceae flavobacteriaceae enterobacteriaceae and rhodobacteraceae fig s6 supplementary material discussion can we predict phage concentrations in wwtp effluents phage concentrations and the phage to prokaryote ratio is highly variable in different environments parikka et al 2017 and fluctuates over time brown et al 2019 there is also an order of magnitude difference in phage concentrations observed in different process streams and wwtps in activated sludge 107 to 109 particles ml 1 have been measured brown et al 2019 otawa et al 2007 wu and liu 2009 and in anaerobic digesters 1010 particles ml 1 were observed wu and liu 2009 the effluent concentrations are typically lower wu and liu 2009 measured a concentration of 108 particles ml 1 in the effluent from a singaporean wwtp and brown et al 2019 measured concentrations of around 108 to 109 particles ml 1 from an english wwtp in this study the vlp concentration measurements in the effluent from the four plants varied by a factor of 5 despite the variability there are indications that wwtp process design and operation could be a predictor of phage concentrations phage production can be linked to prokaryotic productivity parikka et al 2017 zimmerman et al 2020 this has for example been observed in marine environments where lytic viral infections and phage production was higher when the prokaryotic productivity was high during the summer season while lysogeny was more prevalent during the winter season payet and suttle 2013 a wwtp is a highly productive environment and we can therefore expect high phage concentrations however the productivity i e microbial growth rate depends on the process configuration we observed that the activated sludge plants with high organic loading rate a b and d had higher vlp concentrations than plant c fig 2 this could be explained by faster microbial growth and lower fraction of inert material in high loaded systems in plant c we can see that the vlp concentration dropped by 75 4 after the effluent passed through a pond system the microbial activity and density were likely much lower in the ponds than in the activated sludge system leading to the decline in vlp concentration in the tertiary treatment of plant d we could also observe a link between microbial activity and vlp concentration after vlps were removed by the uf unit an increase in vlp concentration could be observed following the gac filtration unit which might be explained by biological activity organic compounds are degraded by a biofilm forming on the activated carbon surface acevedo alonso et al 2021 the biofilm growth in the gac could thus explain the increase in phages in the water many other factors at wwpts such as the type of activated sludge process sbr or continuous flow and the presence of chemical treatment could also affect the vlp concentration as well as the relationship between vlp and doc and should be investigated in further work can we predict phage community composition in wwtp effluents there were clear differences in phage composition between the wwtps the beta diversity analysis suggested that each wwtp had its own distinct phage community despite being samples taken a month apart the three phage communities from plant a clearly grouped and were different from the phage communities in plant b and c fig 4ii phage communities are shaped by interactions with the hosts liu et al 2021 the red queen hypothesis van valen 2014 suggests a continuous arms race between phages and their hosts rohwer and segall 2015 when the host evolves improved defense systems against a phage the phage counteracts this by evolving improved ways of infecting the host a genome study of candidatus accumulibacter species in separate bioreactors found that the species mainly differed in genomic regions related to phage defense suggesting that local arms races with phages likely drives speciation of both the host and the phage kunin et al 2008 speciation caused by arms races between bacteria and phages would lead to different species evolving in different locations this would explain how geographically separate wwtps evolve distinct phage communities which could be observed in our study differences phage community composition could lead to different relationships between phage concentrations and doc at different wwtps despite having different composition several of the host associations could be seen in samples from all the wwtps fig s6 supplementary material among the identified hosts fig 6 many of the taxa are known to belong to the core microbiome of activated sludge these include for example comamonadaceae and rhodocyclaceae wu et al 2019 what are the practical consequences of phage activity for wwtps phage activity affects wwtps in several ways in the effluent the phage particles themselves contribute to the doc concentration the zinc hydroxide precipitation we used to remove phages from the water suggested that they accounted for 22 30 of the doc and that a phage contains 0 54 0 15 10 12 mg carbon this is likely an overestimation as other organic compounds than phages could have been removed from the water in the flocculation process a more realistic estimate was obtained from plant d which used ultrafiltration with a 0 02 µm cutoff although this could also have removed non phage organic particles the number of such particles in the investigated size range was likely small in comparison to the number of phages as indicated by sybr gold staining during nta supplementary video the measurements across the uf unit in plant d suggested that phages made up 11 3 2 6 of the doc in the effluent and that a phage contains 0 24 0 07 10 12 mg carbon this is similar to previous estimates of the carbon content of phage particles which range from 0 055 10 12 to 0 2 10 12 mg steward et al 2007 wilhelm and suttle 1999 jover et al 2014 established a relationship between the elemental content of a phage and its capsid size based on the size measurements in fig 2 we estimate that in an effluent containing 1010 phages per ml the phages would contribute with 0 72 mg l 1 doc 0 29 mg l 1 total nitrogen and 0 11 mg l 1 total phosphorus text s2 supplementary material especially the phosphorus content may be relevant for wwtps which often have strict discharge limits on total phosphorus the linear correlation between doc and vlp concentrations observed in this study fig 3i cannot be solely explained by the carbon content of the phages themselves phage activity can also contribute to effluent doc concentrations by causing lysis of prokaryotic cells in the biological treatment processes the term viral shunt has been used to describe the recycling of nutrients that occurs when viral lysis of host cells results in the release of cellular debris which can be taken up by other prokaryotic cells zimmerman et al 2020 a fraction of the cellular debris is likely recalcitrant jiao et al 2010 and remains in the wwtp effluent high levels of lytic infection would thus both result in high concentrations of phage particles and organic carbon derived from cellular debris phage activity can also lead to changes in the microbial composition of biological treatment process and indirectly affect treatment performance the viral shunt will cause a decline in the population infected by the phage and growth of the co existing microorganisms able to use the released nutrients which affects the balance between different populations such phage driven changes in the relative abundance of different taxa were previously reported for a membrane bioreactor shapiro et al 2010 the arms race between phages and their hosts also leads to diversification and the evolution of phage resistance in the host can be associated with changes in metabolism for example the ability to metabolize organic compounds middelboe et al 2009 this could theoretically have consequences for the performance of wastewater treatment processes phages can also contribute to horizontal gene transfer touchon et al 2017 and affect the metabolism of the microorganisms they infect for example marine phages were shown to carry auxiliary metabolic genes for several nitrogen conversion processes gazitúa et al 2021 nitrogen conversions are important in wastewater treatment and the role of phages for these processes should be explored further in our data set we could see that the distribution of auxiliary metabolic genes where different in phage communities from different wwtps indicating that the effects of phages on microbial metabolism could differ depending on the wwtp both the concentration and the composition of doc in the effluent from biological treatment has effects on the performance of tertiary treatment technologies the effectiveness of advanced oxidation processes is reduced by presence of doc dantas et al 2012 and both the concentration and oxidation state of doc were shown to determine the removal efficiency of micropollutants during ozonation ekblad et al 2019 the sorption efficiency of activated carbon for micropollutant removal is negatively affected by increasing doc concentration boehler et al 2012 disinfection by chlorination is used as the final treatment step at wwtps around the world the presence of doc would increase the chlorine consumption and lead to the formation of toxic byproducts summers et al 2020 managing the doc content in wwtp effluents is therefore an important challenge phage activity is important for the function of biological treatment processes in wwtps and as shown in this study there is a relationship between doc and phage concentrations conclusions based on samples from four swedish wwtps a linear correlation between doc and vlp concentrations could be established the contribution of the vlp to the doc concentration is in the order of one mg per liter in plant d equipped with uf this corresponded to 11 3 2 6 of the total doc in the water since the fraction of the doc that can be attributed to carbon in vlps was quite small there most be another explanation for the observed linear correlation between doc and vlp phage infection of bacterial cells would also cause an increase in doc concentration in the wastewater because of organic compounds released by the lysed host cells high concentrations of vlp could indicate high rates of infections and many lysed host cells which could explain the linear correlation between doc and vlp the phage diversity was high and many phage contigs were taxonomically unidentified the diversity of putative hosts was also high and corresponded to bacterial families frequently found in activated sludge systems differences in phage composition between treatment plants and a possible relationship between organic loading rate and phage concentration and composition suggest that it may be possible to control phage activity by the design and operation of wwtps this warrants further investigations because even small changes in effluent quality caused by phage activity can have consequences for tertiary treatment processes for micropollutants removal and disinfection declaration of competing interest the authors

19922,with stringent effluent requirements and the implementation of new processes for micropollutant removal it is increasingly important for wastewater treatment plants wwtps to understand the factors affecting effluent quality phages viruses infecting prokaryotes are abundant in the biological treatment processes they can contribute to organic carbon in the treated effluent both because they are organic in nature and occur in the effluent and because they cause lysis of microorganisms today very little is known about the effects of phages on effluent quality the goal of this study was therefore to determine the relationship between phages and organic carbon in wwtp effluents we also examined the diversity taxonomy and host association of dna phages using metagenomics effluent samples were collected from four wwtps treating municipal wastewater significant differences in both organic carbon and virus like particle concentrations were observed between the plants and there was a linear relationship between the two parameters the phage communities were diverse with many members being taxonomically unclassified putative hosts were dominated by bacteria known to be abundant in activated sludge systems such as comamonadaceae the composition of phages differed between the wwtps suggesting that local conditions shape the communities overall our findings suggest that the abundance and composition of phages are related to effluent quality thus there is a need for further research clarifying the association between phage dynamics and wwtp function keywords activated sludge bacteriophages metaviromics microbial ecology tertiary treatment introduction most municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps rely on biological processes both suspended growth processes such as activated sludge and biofilm processes such a moving bed biofilm reactors and trickling filters are commonly used these biological reactors contain high numbers of microorganisms that treat the wastewater by removing organic compounds nitrogen and phosphorus the prokaryotic communities in wwtps have been investigated in many studies e g wu et al 2019 yang et al 2011 but the viral communities are less explored phages i e viruses that infect prokaryotes are the most abundant living entities on earth clokie et al 2011 their life cycle includes adsorption and injection of nucleic acids into the host replication using the host cell s molecular machinery and assembly of virus particles virions which are released into the environment to infect other cells lytic phages immediately start to replicate inside the host cell whereas lysogenic phages integrate into the host cell s genome and remain there until their lytic cycle is activated weinbauer 2004 as phages are dependent on host cells to replicate we can expect to find phages wherever prokaryotes are found dennehy and abedon 2021 often phages outnumber prokaryotic cells by an order of magnitude although there is a large variation in the phage to prokaryote ratio between different environments parikka et al 2017 since there are high concentrations of prokaryotes in wastewater treatment processes we can expect to find high concentrations of phages there as well shapiro and kushmaro 2011 indeed previous studies enumerating phage particles in wwtps have found that biological treatment processes have high concentrations otawa et al 2007 typically activated sludge and anaerobic digesters have higher phage particle concentrations than the influent and effluent wastewater brown et al 2019 wu and liu 2009 brown et al 2019 found higher concentrations in the effluent than the influent suggesting that a production of phage particles in the biological reactors leads to a net increase in the wastewater as it moves through a wwtp phages are believed to have a strong influence on the microbial community composition and ecosystem function in wastewater treatment processes but we still know relatively little about their effects brown et al 2019 there are examples where phages have been associated with changes in bioreactor performance for example barr et al 2010 hypothesized that phage infection of candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis was responsible for a decline in the performance of biological phosphorus removal in laboratory scale sequencing batch reactors liu et al 2017 found a decline of nitrifying bacteria corresponding to an increase of phages associated with these bacteria in bulking sludge phage infections can potentially affect the concentration of organic compounds in effluent wastewater lysis of host cells leads to release of organic compounds middelboe et al 1996 some of these organics are immediately used as substrates by other microorganisms rosenberg et al 2010 while others may be more recalcitrant and remain in the effluent in other environments such as the oceans phage induced lysis of microorganisms is known to contribute to the pool of dissolved organic matter breitbart et al 2018 suttle 2005 the phage particles themselves are also organic and although they are small the capsid size of caudovirales members is typically 45 185 nm in diameter dion et al 2020 high concentrations in the water could potentially make a noticeable contribution to the organic carbon concentration today it is becoming increasingly important for wwtps to reach low concentrations of organic carbon in their effluent this is driven both by tougher regulations on effluent biochemical oxygen demand and by prospective implementation of new technologies such as ozonation and activated carbon adsorption for removal of micropollutants for example both the required ozone dose and the lifetime of activated carbon filters depend on the organic carbon concentration in the water boehler et al 2012 nöthe et al 2009 rizzo et al 2019 a small increase in organic carbon concentration can thus lead to increased resource consumption and costs at the treatment plant it is therefore important to understand the causes of variations in effluent organic carbon concentrations phage activity could be one important cause which we currently know very little about thus the goal of this study was to determine the relationship between phage particles and organic carbon concentrations in the effluent of wwtps and to examine the phage communities using metagenomics materials and methods wastewater treatment plants and sampling for analysis of concentrations of organic carbon and phage particles 24 h flow proportional samples were collected from four swedish wwtps treating municipal wastewater see process schemes in fig s1 supplementary material for plant a b and c samples were collected in may 2017 for plant d samples were collected from june to december 2017 samples were stored in plastic containers at a temperature of 4 c until analysis plant a has pre precipitation in settling tanks followed by a high loaded activated sludge process the settled effluent from the activated sludge is partly recycled over nitrifying trickling filters to anoxic zones in the inlet of the activated sludge tanks another part of the secondary effluent flows though nitrifying and denitrifying moving bed biofilm reactors mbbrs methanol is added for the post denitrification step the final effluent is filtered through 15 µm pore size disk filters before discharge the average inflow to the wwtp was 4 4 m3 s 1 and the 7 days biochemical oxygen demand bod7 was 170 mg l the sludge age was 4 6 d and the organic load to the activated sludge was 0 30 kg bod7 kg 1 suspended solids d 1 plant b has pre precipitation in settling tanks followed by a high loaded activated sludge process the settled activated sludge effluent flows through a nitrifying trickling filter followed by post denitrification in methanol fed mbbrs this is followed by dissolved air flotation with the possibility of adding precipitation chemicals the average inflow to the wwtp was 1 2 m3 s 1 and the bod7 was 225 mg l the sludge age was 2 9 d and the organic load was 0 42 kg bod7 kg 1 suspended solids d 1 plant c has primary settling followed by a low loaded activated sludge process with nitrification and pre denitrification this is followed by chemical treatment and sedimentation the final effluent is further treated in a pond system the average inflow to the wwtp was 0 38 m3 s 1 and the bod7 208 mg l the sludge age was 7 21 days and the organic load was 0 058 kg bod7 kg 1 suspended solids d 1 plant d has an activated sludge process with nitrification and pre denitrification in parallel with an activated sludge process using sequencing batch reactors sbrs process the effluent from both these processes go to chemical treatment with dosage of aluminum chloride and final settling about 10 of the effluent was treated in a pilot scale ultrafiltration uf unit with a nominal pore size of 0 02 µm and a granular activated carbon gac filter unit with an empty bed contact time ebct of 19 min on average the total average wastewater inflow was 0 20 m3 s 1 and the bod7 was 290 mg l the sludge age was 9 d in the activated sludge and 14 d in the sbrs the organic load was 0 87 kg bod7 kg 1 suspended solids d 1 where 55 was treated in the activated sludge process and 45 in the sbrs samples for analysis of organic carbon and phage particles were collected from the final effluent in all wwtps in plant c and d samples were collected both after the conventional treatment processes and after tertiary treatment with ponds plant c or uf and gac plant d samples for metagenomics were collected from plants a b and c grab samples collected on three days a month apart were analyzed from plant a one 24 h flow proportional sample each was analyzed from plant b and c after the conventional treatment processes analytical methods the collected samples were filtered through 0 45 µm pore size polyethylene sulfone filters before analysis the organic carbon concentration of the filtered samples was analyzed with a toc analyzer toc v shimadzu this fraction of the organic carbon content in water is conventionally referred to as dissolved organic carbon doc although it contains a mix of truly dissolved and colloidal substances such as phage particles therefore we use the acronym doc for the organic carbon concentrations measured in the study the concentration and size distribution of phage particles were analyzed using nanoparticle tracking analysis nta nanosight ns 300 malvern in nta a laser is used to visualize individual particles in a water sample and a video of the particles is recorded the particle concentration is calculated based on the number of identified particles the hydrodynamic diameters of the particles are calculated based on the brownian motion observed in the videos we determined phage concentrations and size distributions using at least three to five 30 s videos of each sample nta has previously been used to measure phages and adenoviruses in water anderson et al 2011 kramberger et al 2012 it has also been compared to other techniques such as the plaque assay which is the standard way of analyzing concentrations of infectious phages and viruses we also made this comparison using p1 phages text s1 supplementary material the ratio between total virion concentrations measured with nta and the infectious phage concentrations measured as plaque forming units pfu was 12 8 which is in line with previous observations anderson et al 2011 du et al 2010 we also confirmed that the observed particles in wwtp effluents were indeed phages by staining them with sybr gold the sybr gold nucleic acid stain concentrate in dmso thermofisher was diluted 50 times in tris edta buffer ph 7 4 supelco and 25 µl of the dilution was added to 10 ml effluent wastewater resulting in a 20 000 times dilution of the original sybr gold stock solution the mixture was heated at 80 c for 10 min and allowed to cool to room temperature then nta was carried out with a blue laser 488 nm the instrument was equipped with a 500 nm light filter which can be inserted in the light path without the filter all particles can be observed with the filter in the light path only particles stained with sybr gold can be observed the stain rapidly bleached when exposed to the laser which meant only a few seconds long videos could be recorded and hydrodynamic diameters could not be determined therefore dna staining was only carried out on a few samples to confirm that the observed particles were indeed phages see video s1 supplementary material while quantification was done without sybr gold examples of still images of stained and unstained samples are shown in fig 1 we refer to the particles quantified with nta as virus like particles vlp to determine the contribution of vlp to the doc concentration a zinc hydroxide precipitation method was used to remove the fine particles from the water mamais et al 1993 for the samples from plant d this was also compared to measuring the doc concentration in samples collected before and after the ultrafiltration step metagenomics the five samples for metagenomics were filtered through 0 2 µm pore size polyethylene sulfone filters the vlp were concentrated using amicon ultra 15 centrifugal filters with a molecular weight cutoff of 100 kda millipore approximately 50 100 ml sample volume was concentrated to 1 ml to remove extracellular dna 10 µl 20 u of dnase i invitrogen was added to the 1 ml concentrate it was incubated at room temperature for 15 min and thereafter the dnase was inactivated at 75 c for 5 min phage dna was then extracted from the samples using norgen s phage dna isolation kit norgen biotek following the manufacturer s instructions dna fragmentation was performed using a covaris e220 system targeting an insert size of 350 400 bp library preparation was carried out using the smarter thruplex dna seq kit takara paired end 151 bp sequencing was done using a novaseq 6000 system sp flow cell and v1 sequencing chemistry illumina the raw sequence reads are deposited at the european nucleotide archive under project number prjeb50470 the raw sequence reads were quality filtered using fastp v0 20 0 chen et al 2018 the coverage was normalized to a target depth of 100 and a minimum depth of 2 using bbnorm v38 61 https sourceforge net projects bbmap then contigs were assembled individually from each sample using spades v3 15 3 with the setting metaviral antipov et al 2020 checkv v0 8 1 was used to determine whether the contigs represented viral genomes nayfach et al 2021 all contigs with at least one viral gene and more than twice as many viral genes than host genes were retained the relative abundances of the contigs in each sample were determined by mapping the quality filtered reads to the phage contigs using coverm https github com wwood coverm with bwa mem v0 7 17 vasimuddin et al 2019 as mapper for a contig to be considered present in a sample at least 80 of its nucleotides had to have a coverage exceeding one taxonomic classification of the phage contigs was done using phagcn with default settings shang et al 2021 potential hosts of the phages were identified using two methods in the first method we mapped the phage contigs against the crispr spacer database of crispropendb dion et al 2021 in the second we used anvio v7 eren et al 2021 to taxonomically classify trna sequences in the phage contigs in anvio trnascan se is used for identification of trna sequences chan and lowe 2019 the results from the two methods were combined and the phage host associations were visualized using circos krzywinski et al 2009 the presence and function of auxiliary metabolic genes in the phage genomes was determined in anvio using the function anvi estimate metabolism genes were predicted using prodigal v2 6 3 hyatt et al 2010 gene functions were determined by matching the genes to kegg orthologs using the kofam database aramaki et al 2020 the genes were then categorized into metabolic pathways as defined by kegg modules muto et al 2013 statistical methods to determine differences in vlp concentration doc concentrations and particle sizes between wwtps levene s test for equal variances was first carried out then a one way anova was done to determine if statistically significant differences existed finally tukey s honest significant difference hsd post hoc test was done for pairwise comparisons the levene and anova tests were done using scipy virtanen et al 2020 and tukey s hsd was done using statsmodels seabold and perktold 2010 correlation between parameters was examined using ordinary linear regression in statsmodels diversity was calculated as the hill number of diversity order 1 1d jost 2006 this diversity index weighs each phage contig according to its relative abundance in the sample and the index can therefore be interpreted as the number of phage contigs that are common in the sample pielou s evenness index pielou 1966 was used to quantify the distribution of phage contigs detected in a sample the index ranges from 0 to 1 and a high value means that all detected contigs have similar relative abundance in the sample i e high evenness the difference in phage composition between samples was calculated as hill based dissimilarity of diversity order 1 this index ranges from 0 to 1 and can be interpreted as the fraction of common phage contigs not shared between pairs of samples diversity indices and principal coordinate analysis pcoa were calculated using qdiv modin et al 2020 results the concentrations of vlp and doc were different in the four wwtps in fig 2 the concentrations of doc and vlp and the sizes of the vlp in the four wwtps are shown there were significantly different concentrations of effluent doc between wwtps p 4 10 6 anova these ranged from 7 1 0 6 mg l 1 average standard deviation n 7 for plant c to 14 7 3 0 mg l 1 n 4 for plant d post hoc pairwise comparisons showed significant differences p 0 02 tukey s hsd between all plants except a and b for vlp there were also significant differences p 0 01 anova with concentration ranging from 3 8 0 7 109 vlp ml 1 in plant c to 7 3 3 3 109 vlp ml 1 in plant d pairwise comparisons showed that plant c had significantly lower concentrations than plant a and d p 0 02 tukey s hsd no significant difference in the mean and mode of the vlp diameters between the wwtps was observed the vlp size distribution is also shown in fig s2 supplementary material the mode of the size distribution was between 90 5 nm in plant c and 102 22 nm in plant d there was a linear correlation between vlp and doc concentrations using linear regression the correlation between doc and vlp concentrations was investigated fig 3 i there was a significant correlation r2 adj 0 73 p 0 001 and the slope of the regression line was 1 25 0 33 10 12 mg doc vlp 1 95 confidence interval when linear regression was carried out on the data from each plant individually positive correlations could be observed for all plants with pearson s r ranging from 0 54 to 0 99 the correlations were statistically significant for plants c and d p 0 05 fig s3 supplementary material vlp contributed to the doc concentrations the possible contribution of vlp to the doc was investigated by removing particles from the water using a flocculation method and then measure the doc and vlp concentrations again fig 3ii the reduction in doc concentration after flocculation was between 22 4 average standard deviation n 7 in plant a and 30 6 n 2 in plant d the reduction in vlp concentration ranged from 88 5 in plant a to 99 1 in plant b n 7 the reduction in doc was correlated with the reduction in vlp r2 adj 0 73 p 0 001 and the slope of the regression line was 0 54 0 15 10 12 mg doc vlp 1 95 confidence interval there was also a linear correlation for all plants individually with pearson s r ranging from 0 45 to 0 93 although the correlations were only significant for plants a and c fig s4 supplementary material as plant d was equipped with a uf unit with a cutoff of 0 02 µm this provided an alternative way of analyzing the contribution of vlp to doc the doc concentrations dropped from 14 7 2 6 to 13 0 2 4 mg l 1 corresponding to a reduction of 11 3 2 6 the vlp concentrations dropped from 7 3 2 8 109 to 0 022 0 004 109 vlp ml 1 corresponding to a reduction of 99 7 0 1 n 4 for these four samples no statistically significant linear correlation could be determined but the ratio between changes in doc and vlp was 0 24 0 07 10 12 mg doc vlp 1 average standard deviation n 4 tertiary treatment had varying effects on the doc and vlp concentrations plant c was equipped with a pond system as tertiary treatment before the effluent was discharged as water flowed through the ponds the doc concentration decreased by 9 11 from 7 1 0 5 mg l 1 to 6 4 0 4 mg l 1 average standard deviation n 5 the vlp concentration on the other hand decreased by 75 4 from 3 8 0 7 109 vlp ml 1 to 0 96 0 23 109 vlp ml 1 there was no change in the size distribution of vlps fig s5 supplementary material plant d was equipped with a uf unit followed by gac filter unit as mentioned above the uf removed 99 7 0 1 of the vlp and 11 3 2 6 of the doc the following gac filtration led to a decrease in the doc concentration by 14 9 from 13 0 2 4 mg l 1 to 11 0 1 3 mg l 1 the vlp concentration increased across the gac filter from 0 02 0 004 109 vlp ml 1 to 0 14 0 04 109 vlp ml 1 phage communities from different wwtps had different composition the bioinformatics resulted in 366 phage contigs out of which 106 were classified as complete phage genomes while 43 73 and 143 were classified a high medium and low quality genomes respectively by checkv the phage communities had similar alpha diversity and evenness fig 4 i ii for beta diversity the three samples from plant a clustered suggesting they had similar composition in comparison to the samples from the other two wwtps fig 4iii a difference in composition between samples from different plants was also seen in the analysis of auxiliary metabolic genes in the viral contigs fig 5 these are genes that encode various metabolic functions in the host cells breitbart et al 2018 the sample from plant a had an even distribution between genes associated with nucleotide and amino acid metabolism in plant b metabolism of co factors and vitamins dominated while amino acid metabolism dominated in plant c putative viral hosts were diverse putative associations between phages and hosts are shown in fig 6 among phage classifications siphoviridae myoviridae and podoviridae were the most common many contigs were also unclassified phages out of the 366 phage contigs 70 could be linked to a putative host comamonadaceae pseudomonadaceae rhodocyclaceae and burkholderiaceae were the most common host affiliations represented by 9 6 6 and 5 contigs respectively there were 20 phage contigs that could be detected in all five samples most of the contigs in this core community were unclassified and only one a siphoviridae had a host link to a pseudomonadaceae sp the most common host affiliation that could be observed in all five samples were comamonadaceae pseudomonadaceae flavobacteriaceae enterobacteriaceae and rhodobacteraceae fig s6 supplementary material discussion can we predict phage concentrations in wwtp effluents phage concentrations and the phage to prokaryote ratio is highly variable in different environments parikka et al 2017 and fluctuates over time brown et al 2019 there is also an order of magnitude difference in phage concentrations observed in different process streams and wwtps in activated sludge 107 to 109 particles ml 1 have been measured brown et al 2019 otawa et al 2007 wu and liu 2009 and in anaerobic digesters 1010 particles ml 1 were observed wu and liu 2009 the effluent concentrations are typically lower wu and liu 2009 measured a concentration of 108 particles ml 1 in the effluent from a singaporean wwtp and brown et al 2019 measured concentrations of around 108 to 109 particles ml 1 from an english wwtp in this study the vlp concentration measurements in the effluent from the four plants varied by a factor of 5 despite the variability there are indications that wwtp process design and operation could be a predictor of phage concentrations phage production can be linked to prokaryotic productivity parikka et al 2017 zimmerman et al 2020 this has for example been observed in marine environments where lytic viral infections and phage production was higher when the prokaryotic productivity was high during the summer season while lysogeny was more prevalent during the winter season payet and suttle 2013 a wwtp is a highly productive environment and we can therefore expect high phage concentrations however the productivity i e microbial growth rate depends on the process configuration we observed that the activated sludge plants with high organic loading rate a b and d had higher vlp concentrations than plant c fig 2 this could be explained by faster microbial growth and lower fraction of inert material in high loaded systems in plant c we can see that the vlp concentration dropped by 75 4 after the effluent passed through a pond system the microbial activity and density were likely much lower in the ponds than in the activated sludge system leading to the decline in vlp concentration in the tertiary treatment of plant d we could also observe a link between microbial activity and vlp concentration after vlps were removed by the uf unit an increase in vlp concentration could be observed following the gac filtration unit which might be explained by biological activity organic compounds are degraded by a biofilm forming on the activated carbon surface acevedo alonso et al 2021 the biofilm growth in the gac could thus explain the increase in phages in the water many other factors at wwpts such as the type of activated sludge process sbr or continuous flow and the presence of chemical treatment could also affect the vlp concentration as well as the relationship between vlp and doc and should be investigated in further work can we predict phage community composition in wwtp effluents there were clear differences in phage composition between the wwtps the beta diversity analysis suggested that each wwtp had its own distinct phage community despite being samples taken a month apart the three phage communities from plant a clearly grouped and were different from the phage communities in plant b and c fig 4ii phage communities are shaped by interactions with the hosts liu et al 2021 the red queen hypothesis van valen 2014 suggests a continuous arms race between phages and their hosts rohwer and segall 2015 when the host evolves improved defense systems against a phage the phage counteracts this by evolving improved ways of infecting the host a genome study of candidatus accumulibacter species in separate bioreactors found that the species mainly differed in genomic regions related to phage defense suggesting that local arms races with phages likely drives speciation of both the host and the phage kunin et al 2008 speciation caused by arms races between bacteria and phages would lead to different species evolving in different locations this would explain how geographically separate wwtps evolve distinct phage communities which could be observed in our study differences phage community composition could lead to different relationships between phage concentrations and doc at different wwtps despite having different composition several of the host associations could be seen in samples from all the wwtps fig s6 supplementary material among the identified hosts fig 6 many of the taxa are known to belong to the core microbiome of activated sludge these include for example comamonadaceae and rhodocyclaceae wu et al 2019 what are the practical consequences of phage activity for wwtps phage activity affects wwtps in several ways in the effluent the phage particles themselves contribute to the doc concentration the zinc hydroxide precipitation we used to remove phages from the water suggested that they accounted for 22 30 of the doc and that a phage contains 0 54 0 15 10 12 mg carbon this is likely an overestimation as other organic compounds than phages could have been removed from the water in the flocculation process a more realistic estimate was obtained from plant d which used ultrafiltration with a 0 02 µm cutoff although this could also have removed non phage organic particles the number of such particles in the investigated size range was likely small in comparison to the number of phages as indicated by sybr gold staining during nta supplementary video the measurements across the uf unit in plant d suggested that phages made up 11 3 2 6 of the doc in the effluent and that a phage contains 0 24 0 07 10 12 mg carbon this is similar to previous estimates of the carbon content of phage particles which range from 0 055 10 12 to 0 2 10 12 mg steward et al 2007 wilhelm and suttle 1999 jover et al 2014 established a relationship between the elemental content of a phage and its capsid size based on the size measurements in fig 2 we estimate that in an effluent containing 1010 phages per ml the phages would contribute with 0 72 mg l 1 doc 0 29 mg l 1 total nitrogen and 0 11 mg l 1 total phosphorus text s2 supplementary material especially the phosphorus content may be relevant for wwtps which often have strict discharge limits on total phosphorus the linear correlation between doc and vlp concentrations observed in this study fig 3i cannot be solely explained by the carbon content of the phages themselves phage activity can also contribute to effluent doc concentrations by causing lysis of prokaryotic cells in the biological treatment processes the term viral shunt has been used to describe the recycling of nutrients that occurs when viral lysis of host cells results in the release of cellular debris which can be taken up by other prokaryotic cells zimmerman et al 2020 a fraction of the cellular debris is likely recalcitrant jiao et al 2010 and remains in the wwtp effluent high levels of lytic infection would thus both result in high concentrations of phage particles and organic carbon derived from cellular debris phage activity can also lead to changes in the microbial composition of biological treatment process and indirectly affect treatment performance the viral shunt will cause a decline in the population infected by the phage and growth of the co existing microorganisms able to use the released nutrients which affects the balance between different populations such phage driven changes in the relative abundance of different taxa were previously reported for a membrane bioreactor shapiro et al 2010 the arms race between phages and their hosts also leads to diversification and the evolution of phage resistance in the host can be associated with changes in metabolism for example the ability to metabolize organic compounds middelboe et al 2009 this could theoretically have consequences for the performance of wastewater treatment processes phages can also contribute to horizontal gene transfer touchon et al 2017 and affect the metabolism of the microorganisms they infect for example marine phages were shown to carry auxiliary metabolic genes for several nitrogen conversion processes gazitúa et al 2021 nitrogen conversions are important in wastewater treatment and the role of phages for these processes should be explored further in our data set we could see that the distribution of auxiliary metabolic genes where different in phage communities from different wwtps indicating that the effects of phages on microbial metabolism could differ depending on the wwtp both the concentration and the composition of doc in the effluent from biological treatment has effects on the performance of tertiary treatment technologies the effectiveness of advanced oxidation processes is reduced by presence of doc dantas et al 2012 and both the concentration and oxidation state of doc were shown to determine the removal efficiency of micropollutants during ozonation ekblad et al 2019 the sorption efficiency of activated carbon for micropollutant removal is negatively affected by increasing doc concentration boehler et al 2012 disinfection by chlorination is used as the final treatment step at wwtps around the world the presence of doc would increase the chlorine consumption and lead to the formation of toxic byproducts summers et al 2020 managing the doc content in wwtp effluents is therefore an important challenge phage activity is important for the function of biological treatment processes in wwtps and as shown in this study there is a relationship between doc and phage concentrations conclusions based on samples from four swedish wwtps a linear correlation between doc and vlp concentrations could be established the contribution of the vlp to the doc concentration is in the order of one mg per liter in plant d equipped with uf this corresponded to 11 3 2 6 of the total doc in the water since the fraction of the doc that can be attributed to carbon in vlps was quite small there most be another explanation for the observed linear correlation between doc and vlp phage infection of bacterial cells would also cause an increase in doc concentration in the wastewater because of organic compounds released by the lysed host cells high concentrations of vlp could indicate high rates of infections and many lysed host cells which could explain the linear correlation between doc and vlp the phage diversity was high and many phage contigs were taxonomically unidentified the diversity of putative hosts was also high and corresponded to bacterial families frequently found in activated sludge systems differences in phage composition between treatment plants and a possible relationship between organic loading rate and phage concentration and composition suggest that it may be possible to control phage activity by the design and operation of wwtps this warrants further investigations because even small changes in effluent quality caused by phage activity can have consequences for tertiary treatment processes for micropollutants removal and disinfection declaration of competing interest the authors

19923,aerobic granular sludge ags is an advanced biofilm based technology for wastewater treatment diffusion of substrates into the granules is a key aspect of this technology domestic wastewater contains soluble organic substrates of different sizes that could potentially diffuse into the granules in this study the relation between the molecular weight of a substrate and its diffusion coefficient within the granule was studied with model substrates polyethylene glycols pegs with a molecular weight between 62 and 10 000 da the diffusion coefficients of the model substrates within granules from a full scale installation were measured with the transient uptake of a non reactive solute method the diffusion coefficients in the granules were not significantly different from the diffusion coefficients in water at least up to 4000 da molecular weight this indicates that these pegs were not obstructed by the granule matrix the 10 kda peg behaved differently from the lighter pegs as it could not penetrate the entire granule furthermore the granule structure was characterized with environmental scanning electron microscopy esem the granules displayed an open structure with large macropores and semi solid regions which contained microbial cells the diffusion results suggest that most diffusing molecules were unobstructed in the macropores and barely obstructed in the semi solid regions only the diffusion of the 10 kda peg seemed to be hindered by the semi solid regions but not by the macropores lastly the apparent molecular weight distribution of domestic wastewater soluble cod was determined with ultrafiltration membranes of 100 10 and 1 kda molecular weight cut off the influent fractionation revealed that a large part 61 69 of the influent soluble cod was lighter than 1 kda as molecules lighter than 1 kda diffuse easily the majority of the influent soluble cod can be considered as diffusible cod these findings provide new insight into the availability of influent cod for granular sludge graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords diffusion biofilms esem molecular weight aerobic granular sludge 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge ags is a recent innovation for the treatment of wastewater pronk et al 2015 the technology consists of microorganisms that produce extracellular polymeric substances eps to form granular biofilms or granules due to the limited penetration of oxygen into the granule different redox conditions can exist throughout the granule therefore nutrient removal processes such as nitrification denitrification and phosphorus uptake can occur simultaneously in a single reactor kishida et al 2009 wei et al 2014 sedimentation tanks are no longer needed due to the high settling velocity of the aerobic granules bengtsson et al 2018 as a result aerobic granular sludge technology requires less energy and land area compared to conventional activated sludge installations de bruin de kreuk van der roest uijterlinde and van loosdrecht 2004 pronk et al 2015 most ags research has been carried out with lab scale systems that were fed with small and soluble substrates like volatile fatty acids vfas or glucose adav et al 2008 de kreuk heijnen and van loosdrecht 2005 de sousa rollemberg et al 2018 these substrates can diffuse readily into the granules even into deeper zones pronk et al 2015 the diffusivity of the substrates has a major impact on the overall performance of granular sludge reactors layer et al 2019 a deep penetration of substrates will contribute to the formation of stable granules and to a high denitrification activity layer et al 2020 zheng et al 2006 at the same time often only a small fraction of real wastewater consists of small and soluble substrates the concentration of vfas in domestic wastewater is generally less than 10 of the influent chemical oxygen demand cod henze et al 1995 the other soluble substrates in the wastewater can account for 10 20 of the influent cod henze et al 1995 the exact nature and size of this non vfa soluble cod fraction is poorly understood soluble cod can be as small as acetate but also as large as a colloid up to 0 45 µm as a result the diffusion behaviour of the soluble cod in the granules is poorly understood as well diffusion in different biofilms has been researched extensively in the 1980s and the 1990s stewart 1998 however there are several limitations that hamper our knowledge on diffusion in biofilms and granules firstly most studies focused on small substrates like oxygen ammonium acetate and glucose chiu et al 2006 liu et al 2009 stewart 1998 only a handful of studies have measured diffusion coefficients of molecules that are heavier than 300 da bryers and drummond 1998 peulen and wilkinson 2011 takenaka et al 2009 thurnheer et al 2003 it is therefore not clear how the size of a solute affects its diffusion behaviour secondly different studies often yield diffusion coefficients that vary greatly stewart 1998 for example the mean relative effective diffusion coefficient dbiofilm daq for solutes with a molecular weight between 44 and 342 da was reported as 0 29 0 24 stewart 1998 this large variability is partially the result of differences in biofilm density between studies horn and morgenroth 2006 but it is not clear if other factors play a role as well lastly our knowledge on diffusion in biofilms is limited due to the inherent inaccuracy of the methods that are commonly used to measure diffusion coefficients van den berg van loosdrecht and de kreuk 2021 overall the understanding of diffusion in biofilms and granules is very limited especially regarding heavier molecules 300 da the objectives of this study were 1 to determine the effect of the molecular weight of a molecule on its diffusion coefficient in aerobic granules 2 to determine the pore structure of the granules and 3 to determine the distribution of soluble cod in different wastewaters the diffusion coefficients of different polyethylene glycols pegs uncharged model substrates with a molecular weight between 62 and 10 000 da were measured with the transient uptake of a non reactive solute method the diffusion behaviour was related to the granule structure observed by esem the distribution of soluble cod in domestic wastewater samples was determined through ultrafiltration with a 100 10 and 1 kda molecular weight cut off 2 materials and methods 2 1 granule source aerobic granules were harvested from the full scale nereda plant in utrecht the netherlands the plant treats domestic wastewater with a cod of 649 173 mg l a bod5 of 300 95 mg l and a tss of 297 95 mg l all average values with standard deviation during the 3 month sampling period the average sludge loading rate was 0 05 kg cod kg ds d the solids retention time was 20 50 days the reactor was operated with biological phosphate removal the sampled granules were sieved to retain only granules with size of 2 0 2 5 mm and afterward washed repeatedly to remove any non granular material washing of the granules was done in three steps first the granules were suspended in tap water second the granules were allowed to settle for a short time third the liquid on top of the granules was decanted these three steps were repeated around 5 10 times this way all material that did not settle well was removed from the granule sample the granules were stored in tap water at 4 c for a maximum of 2 weeks 2 2 diffusion experiments experiments to determine solute diffusion coefficients in aerobic granules were carried out with the transient uptake of a non reactive solute method westrin and zacchi 1991 the experiments were conducted with a working volume of 300 ml in a 500 ml jacketed glass vessel adequate mixing was provided by an orbital shaker heathrow scientific digital orbital shaker 19 2 mm orbit diameter 170 rpm the orbital shaker was chosen to limit granule breakage from excessive shear de graaff van dijk van loosdrecht and pronk 2018 the temperature was controlled at 4 0 0 1 c to limit biological activity two solutions were prepared for the experiment one with the granules and one with a specific molecule for the granule solution a certain amount of granules was added to a volumetric flask of 200 ml volume the amount of the granules was chosen to obtain an α value the ratio of water volume vw over granule volume vg of roughly 4 the flask was then filled to 200 ml with tap water for the specific molecule solution a known mass of a specific solute was added to 100 ml of tap water the solutions were pre chilled and added to the jacketed glass vessel quickly to start the experiment samples were taken at irregular intervals to best capture the non linear bulk liquid concentration profile over time for each experiment 25 samples of 0 5 ml were taken through modified pipette tips regular plastic 1 ml pipette tips were covered in a stainless steel woven mesh with a mesh size of 100 µm to prevent the granules from clogging the pipette tip the volume lost through sampling was immediately replaced by an equal amount of a solution with a concentration of the expected final solute value as described in nguyen and luong 1986 at the end of each experiment the temperature was increased to 20 c and the granule volume was determined with the modified dextran blue method van den berg pronk van loosdrecht and de kreuk 2021 finally total suspended solids and volatile suspended solids of the granules were determined according to standard methods apha 2005 polyethyleneglycols pegs of different molecular weight were used as solute in the diffusion experiment reagent grade pegs with average molecular weights of 62 106 200 300 400 600 1000 1500 2000 4000 and 10 000 da were obtained from merck the pegs with molecular weight of 62 and 106 da were monodisperse while the other pegs had a reported polydispersity index between 1 12 and 1 30 the initial peg concentration in each experiment was approximately 1 mg ml with the exact value determined for each experiment separately the diffusion coefficients of the different pegs were taken from waggoner et al 1995 2 3 data analysis the diffusion coefficients de of the molecules in the granules were derived from the concentration change in the bulk liquid if granules are initially free of substrate and the entire granule is accessible for diffusion the decrease in bulk liquid concentration can be described by the following equation crank 1975 1 c b t c b t 0 1 1 α α n 1 6 α 1 α exp d e q n 2 t r 2 9 9 α q n 2 α 2 here cb t is the bulk liquid concentration at time t r is the granule radius α is the ratio of liquid volume over granule volume and the qn s are the non zero positive roots of 2 tan q n 3 q n 3 α q n 2 the granule volume water volume total experimental volume granule volume and granule radius see section 2 6 were determined experimentally the initial solute concentration could not always be measured accurately in the experimental setup since diffusion of the solute into the granule started before the liquid volume concentration was completely homogeneous instead the initial concentration was calculated from the weight of solute added and the water volume in the experiment non linear least squares fitting of the diffusion model eq 1 to the experimental bulk liquid concentration data was used to find the best approximation for the diffusion coefficient in order to ensure that the global optimum was found rather than a local optimum random initial values were used repeatedly for each experiment 500 random initial values were used that varied between 1 10 13 and 2 10 9 m2 s 1 the precision of the diffusion coefficient was estimated according to the procedure of alper and gelb 1990 with this procedure the uncertainty in the granule radius granule volume and peg concentrations was propagated to the diffusion coefficient one thousand monte carlo simulations were used to approximate the standard deviation of the fitted diffusion coefficient the obtained diffusion coefficients at 4 c were all converted to corresponding values at 25 c based on einstein 1905 3 d 25 d 4 t 25 t 4 μ 4 μ 25 here d is the diffusion coefficient m2 s t is the absolute temperature k and µ is the dynamic viscosity of water 2 4 environmental scanning electron microscope analysis several granules were examined by environmental scanning electron microscopy esem to relate diffusion with the granule pore structure esem does not require desiccation or coating of the granules therefore the granules can be imaged without any pre processing and in a fully hydrated state a quanta feg 650 fei company usa was used with a gaseous secondary electron detector and a peltier cooling stage set at 0 5 c the granules were imaged at pressures between 3 and 7 mbar which corresponds to a relative humidity of 50 100 several granules were sliced into two halves with a scalpel to examine the inner structure of the granules with esem as well as reference sample alginate beads were included in the analysis the beads were prepared by dissolving sodium alginate sigma in demineralised water to a 2 w v solution and dripping this solution into a 2 5 w v cacl2 solution the alginate beads were allowed to harden for 30 min and subsequently stored in tap water 2 5 influent characterization influent samples from three wastewater treatment plants wwtp were analysed to determine the molecular weight distribution of the soluble organic fraction the influent samples originated from three wwtps in the netherlands all treating domestic wastewater from utrecht wwtp in utrecht 480 000 million population equivalents p e from harnaschpolder wwtp in den hoorn 1 3 million p e and from bath wwtp in rilland bath 485 000 p e these three wwtps were selected because of the different sewer systems utrecht wwtp is fed from a relatively short gravity sewer system harnaschpolder wwtp is fed from both short and longer pressure mains and bath wwtp is fed from a long pressure main around 44 of the influent to bath wwtp was industrial wastewater originating from petrochemical chemical and waste processing facilities flow proportional composite samples from a 24 h period were collected after the influent screening 6 mm the samples were collected in the months october november and january during dry weather flow conditions immediately after collection the samples were stored at 4 c for a maximum of 3 h prior to analysis after a brief settling period the samples were filtered in an amicon ultrafiltration cell merck millipore the filtration was carried out serially with a 0 45 µm filter durapore pvdf merck millipore and ultrafiltration membranes of 100 10 and 1 kda nominal molecular weight cut off ultracell regenerated cellulose merck millipore the membranes were treated according to the manufacturer s instructions the filtration was performed at 20 c and with a pressure of 2 bar from nitrogen gas 2 6 analytical methods chemical oxygen demand cod phosphate po4 p and ammonium nh4 n in the filtered wastewater samples were measured in triplicate with hach lange test kits the cod measurements was based on the dichromate method total suspended solids and volatile suspended solids in the wastewater samples were determined in triplicate according to standard methods apha 2005 vfa in the wastewater were analysed with high performance liquid chromatography hplc prominence shimadzu japan equipped with an ion exchange column aminex hpx 87h bio rad and a uv index detector spd 20a shimadzu japan sulphuric acid in ultrapure water 5 mm was used as eluent the individual vfa concentrations of acetate propionate and butyrate were converted to cod and lumped together to yield the total vfa concentration in mg cod l the concentration of peg samples was measured with the same hplc system equipped with two size exclusion chromatography columns in series suprema 5 µm 30 å pss gmbh germany and a refractive index detector rid 20a shimadzu japan ultrapure water was used as eluent at a flow rate of 0 8 ml min the size distribution of the granule samples was determined with a digital microscope keyence vhx 700f the microscope images were processed with imagej software to obtain a granule size distribution and an average aspect ratio schneider et al 2012 3 results 3 1 diffusion coefficients in ags the diffusion coefficients of different peg molecules within aerobic granules were determined with the transient uptake of a non reactive solute method each experiment yielded a bulk liquid concentration profile over time an average granule radius a granule volume and the liquid volume examples of the concentration profiles from the transient uptake experiments are given in fig 1 most concentration profiles followed a non linear decrease from the initial concentration c0 to the equilibrium concentration ceq there was no significant consumption of the solute during the experiments since consumption of the solute would result in a final concentration lower than the expected equilibrium concentration a detailed overview of the individual diffusion experiments is given in table a 1 and figure a 1 for the peg molecules between 62 and 4000 da the relative diffusion coefficient de daq in the granules was between 0 73 and 1 22 the diffusion coefficients of the pegs in the granule displayed large variability with standard deviations ranging from 28 to 34 these large standard deviations are probably the cause of the relative diffusion coefficient larger than 1 for peg200 400 1000 1500 and 4000 the diffusivity of pegs in the granule decreased logarithmically with the molecular weight of the pegs similar to the diffusivity of pegs in water see fig 2 the relation between diffusivity and molecular weight is given by 4 log d a log m w b here d is the diffusion coefficient mw is the molecular weight coefficient a is the slope and coefficient b is the intercept for peg diffusion in water the slope is 0 597 0 020 and the intercept is 7 951 0 077 waggoner et al 1995 for peg diffusion in the granules the slope and intercept found in this study are 0 564 0 044 and 8 070 0 126 respectively a t test revealed that the slope of granules and water were not significantly different from each other t 18 0 68 p 51 the same applied for the intercept t 18 0 81 p 43 thus the granule matrix had no significant effect on the diffusion of peg of all the tested molecular weights from 62 to 4000 da for almost all diffusion experiments the equilibrium concentration was equal to the expected equilibrium concentration this indicates that the concentration in the bulk liquid was equal to the final concentration in the whole granule there was one exception namely the 10 kda peg molecule see fig 1b the concentration in this experiment stabilized at a higher level than expected as a result no diffusion coefficient could be extracted from this experiment the diffusion model that is used to determine the diffusion coefficient see eq 1 requires that the expected equilibrium is reached the high equilibrium concentration in this experiment indicates that not all granule volume is accessible for this 10 kda molecule a mass balance of peg at the final equilibrium eq 5 showed that only 65 of the granule volume was accessible for this molecule mass 5 c eq f acce sible v g v w c 0 v w here faccesible is the fraction of the granule volume that is accessible for a molecule 3 2 characterization of the granules the hydrated structure of the granules was visualized with esem to gain insight into the medium through which the peg molecules diffused an overview of the collected esem images is given in fig 3 the images reveal a complex granule architecture the majority of the granule surface was heterogeneous and many large voids with a diameter of 10 20 µm were visible fig 3a c it is unclear exactly how far these voids penetrate into the granules still the lack of signal from these voids the black colour in the esem images suggests that they are not shallow the granule surface also showed thick strands that form a connected network these fibril like strands were of similar diameter as the microbial cells which are visible as well around 0 5 1 µm fig 3a c the length of the polymer strands was in the range of 10 30 µm some parts of the granule surface were much less heterogeneous and displayed dense clusters of cells underneath a smooth surface fig 3d however only a minority of the granule surface had this more homogeneous nature the inside of the granules was even more open than the granule surface fig 3e shows in the centre of the sliced granule the structure was almost completely open and large voids were visible the structure of the surface of alginate beads which were included as reference material was very different from that of the aerobic granules fig 3f the surface of the beads showed vein like structures which could be the result of shrinking during the preparation of the beads however aside from these structures the surface was completely smooth and no pores could be identified 3 3 influent characterization influent wastewater was collected from three wwtps the sewer systems feeding the wwtps differed in terms of hydraulic retention time and sewer type the wastewaters were all fractionated to reveal the apparent molecular weight distribution of soluble cod as can be seen in table 1 the three wastewaters showed similar characteristics the majority of the cod was present in the particulate form 62 77 around 15 26 of the total cod was present in the smallest size fraction which was below 1 kda in size only a minor fraction 11 12 of the influent cod was present in the fractions from 1 kda to 0 45 µm this means that the majority 61 69 of the soluble cod in all three wastewaters was lighter than 1 kda the vfas were only a minor fraction of the soluble cod 17 21 4 discussion 4 1 diffusion coefficients of peg molecules in the past many researchers have studied diffusion in biofilms there appeared to be a relation between the molecular weight of a solute and its relative diffusivity in biofilms the reported relative diffusivity of small solutes 44 da was 0 46 while that of large solutes 44 342 da was 0 39 stewart 1998 the relative diffusivities found in this study were much higher between 0 73 and 1 22 furthermore there was no discernible effect of the solute molecular weight on the relative diffusivity for molecules between 62 and 4000 da this is surprising as the molecular weight range used in this study is much greater than the molecular weight range included in the review of stewart 1998 one possible explanation for the discrepancy relates to the method used in this study the transient uptake of a non reactive solute method has been used previously to measure diffusion coefficients in hydrogel beads and biofilms chresand et al 1988 fan leyva ramos wisecarver zehner 1990 pu and yang 1988 the limitations of this method has been described previously highlighting the low precision as major issue van den berg van loosdrecht et al 2021 westrin and zacchi 1991 this low precision was observed here as well but it cannot explain the large difference between our results and the results described in literature alternatively the diffusion coefficients in this study could be overestimated due to systematic errors or biases however the effect of most systematic errors for this method is that the diffusion coefficient is underestimated van den berg van loosdrecht et al 2021 there are only two systematic errors that lead to an overestimation deactivation of the biomass and a non spherical granule shape we do not expect any bias from deactivation as we did not use deactivating chemicals the granule shape could have an influence as ellipsoidal granules have a higher surface to volume ratio than perfectly spherical granules as a result the concentration in the liquid decreases faster and the diffusion coefficient is overestimated if granules are assumed to be spherical however the average aspect ratio of the granules was only 1 44 our previous research has shown that this corresponds to an overestimation of the diffusion of only 10 van den berg van loosdrecht et al 2021 thus it is not likely that our findings significantly overestimate the diffusion coefficient in fact the diffusion coefficient could even be slightly underestimated due to the rough surface of the granule the granule size distribution or the mass transfer boundary layer van den berg van loosdrecht et al 2021 another explanation for the difference between our study and previous studies relates to the methods and types of biofilm used in the previous studies a thorough analysis of the studies included in the review of stewart 1998 revealed several issues see table a 1 for full details in total there were 21 studies on diffusion of larger molecules with molecular weight of 44 342 da from these 21 studies 12 used the steady state reaction method which is very imprecise and inaccurate van den berg van loosdrecht et al 2021 furthermore 5 out of the remaining 9 studies were performed on biofilms with a density greater than 150 g l it is not surprising that the diffusion coefficient in such a high density biofilm is much lower than in aerobic granules with a density of 90 g l horn and morgenroth 2006 the remaining 4 studies were performed with sludge flocs 3 or without considering biomass activity 1 as a result all studies on larger molecules that are included in stewart 1998 have clear limitations and a direct comparison with our findings is futile there are several studies not included in the review of stewart 1998 that focused on molecules in the kda range these studies are commonly carried out with fluorescent dextran molecules and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy or fluorescence recovery after photobleaching these techniques measure diffusion coefficients in specific locations in a biofilm instead of the average diffusion coefficients measured in this study several studies of kda sized molecules report high relative diffusivities for molecules between 3 and 10 kda in biofilms takenaka et al 2009 zhang et al 2011 and alginate beads favre et al 2001 puguan et al 2015 for example peulen and wilkinson 2011 found a relative diffusivity of 60 80 for a 3 kda and a 10 kda dextran in a pseudomonas fluorescens biofilm others reported relative lower diffusivities ranging from 0 01 to 0 23 for molecules with a molecular weight between 3 and 10 kda bryers and drummond 1998 lawrence et al 1994 marcotte et al 2004 thurnheer et al 2003 the reason behind this wide range in reported values is unclear but it could be due to differences in biofilm density or structure overall we believe our results are representative for diffusion in aerobic granules despite the large standard deviations the main result of the experiments are not the exact diffusion coefficients but rather the relation between the molecular weight and diffusion coefficient these results have been collected with the same method and the same type of biofilm thus even if the absolute diffusion coefficients would not be reliable the overall trend would remain the same as it turns out the granule matrix has no significant effect on peg molecules of 62 4000 da this conclusion is in contrast with existing literature and provides a new perspective on diffusion specifically in aerobic granules our study has focused on the molecular weight with neutrally charged molecules future research should investigate the effect of charge and hydrophobicity on diffusion in aerobic granules 4 2 granule structure the limited effect of the solute molecular weight on diffusion raised the question why the granule matrix did not provide more obstruction to the larger molecules to address this question we investigated the structure and porosity of the granule matrix with esem imaging in contrast to conventional electron microscopy esem does not require dehydration or fixation the granule therefore esem is an appropriate technique to visualize the eps matrix in its natural hydrated state priester et al 2007 the esem images of the granules see fig 3 revealed that the granules were very heterogeneous with arguably two distinct phases a liquid phase and a semi solid phase the liquid phase is present in large macropores that are visible on the granule surface and in the granule interior the semi solid phase in the granule was present in between the macropores and many microorganisms were embedded within this semi solid phase the presence of macropores or channels and cell clusters is an established observation in biofilm literature bryers and drummond 1998 marcotte et al 2004 peulen and wilkinson 2011 picioreanu et al 2016 sankaran et al 2019 takenaka et al 2009 generally porosity is used as a parameter to compare the volume of the macropores with the volume of the cell clusters however porosity in biofilms is an ill defined concept since both the liquid phase in the macropores as well as the semi solid phase mostly consists of water lewandowski 2000 diffusion occurs both in the macropores and in the semi solid phase the size of micropores in the semi solid phase could not be determined with esem imaging however alginate hydrogels have a typical pore size of 5 20 nm boontheekul et al 2005 leal egaña et al 2011 simpliciano et al 2013 smidsrød and skja 1990 the size of the micropores in the granules could be of a similar order of magnitude since alginate gels are similar to the eps from ags felz et al 2020 lin et al 2010 schambeck et al 2020 the hydrodynamic radius of the pegs used in this study ranged from 0 15 to 2 79 nm devanand and selser 1991 thus the pegs were three orders of magnitude smaller than the granule macropores it is therefore highly likely that the pegs diffused completely unobstructed within the macropores at the same time the pegs were only slightly smaller than the hypothesized pore size of the granule micropores still the diffusion experiments indicated that the pegs with molecular weight up to 4000 da 1 65 nm hydrodynamic radius penetrated throughout the entire granule as the expected equilibrium concentration was reached given that the expected equilibrium was not reached with 10 kda peg it is possible that this molecule was excluded from the micropores the hydrodynamic radius of the 10 kda peg is 2 79 nm devanand and selser 1991 which means that the diameter of the micropores might be around 5 nm still the micropores are apparently large enough to allow diffusion of pegs up to a molecular weight of 4000 da or a hydrodynamic radius up to 1 65 nm the notion that macropores or channels significantly enhance diffusion into the granules is therefore incorrect for molecules lighter than 4000 da for these molecular weights diffusion in the macropores is only marginally faster than diffusion in the micropores in contrast molecules that are excluded from the micropores can only diffuse in the macropores the heterogeneity of the granules is therefore mainly of relevance for heavier molecules 4 kda this discussion highlights that diffusion behaviour in the granules is closely linked to the structure of the eps matrix our results are therefore not universally applicable to all biofilm types the aerobic granules used in this study have a distinct heterogeneous structure with macropores 10 20 µm in diameter and fibrils biofilms with alginate as major component might have a structure more similar to alginate beads see fig 3f and the diffusive behaviour in these biofilms can be very different it is therefore of utmost importance that studies of diffusion in biofilms describe both the diffusion behaviour and the structure of the eps matrix 4 3 implications for practice an important question in the design and operation of ags systems is which fraction of influent cod can rapidly diffuse into the granules during the anaerobic phase of the sequencing batch cycle pronk et al 2015 this diffusible fraction is important for granule formation and for nutrient removal layer et al 2019 the lack of a significant effect of the granule matrix on the relative diffusivity de daq suggests that even larger molecules up to 4000 da are likely to be available for conversion within the granules because of their size larger molecules already diffuse slower in water than small molecules but the granule matrix does not limit their diffusion further we can evaluate the transient penetration of a molecule into a granule with the following equation crank 1975 6 c c b 1 2 n 1 1 n exp d e n 2 π 2 t r 2 here c is the concentration in the granule core cb is the concentration in the bulk liquid r is the granule radius de is the diffusion coefficient and t is the time this equation can be used to estimate the concentration in the granule core after a certain time period we can estimate the diffusive penetration after 60 min which is the length of the anaerobic feeding period for most ags reactors de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 pronk et al 2015 the diffusive penetration is expressed by the relative concentration in the granule core c cb with the diffusion coefficients that were found in this study for 62 4000 da pegs granules with a 1 mm radius and a temperature of 10 c the relative concentration in the granule core c cb ranges from 54 to 100 after 60 min all molecules of 1 kda and lighter reach a relative concentration in the granule core of at least 93 of the concentration in the bulk the molecules between 1 kda and 4 kda penetrate less and reach a c cb between 47 and 93 of course the in situ penetration depth depends on both the diffusive properties as well as the consumption rate still this analysis shows that for many molecules with different size diffusion does not limit penetration depth the above analysis has even stronger implications if the distribution of soluble cod is considered of the soluble cod in the three analysed wastewater samples 61 69 was lighter than 1 kda and 70 87 was lighter than 10 kda this means that at least 61 69 of the soluble cod can diffuse easily into the granules it is therefore likely that the majority of the soluble cod is converted within the granules where it can contribute to nutrient removal layer et al 2019 2020 nevertheless the composition of wastewater can vary significantly between different locations henze and harremoës 1992 we found a similar cod distribution for three wastewaters which originated from different sewer systems in the netherlands nevertheless similar soluble cod distributions were found by other authors for domestic textile tannery and agricultural wastewaters doğruel 2012 dulekgurgen et al 2006 hu et al 2002 karahan et al 2008 ravndal et al 2018 it is however not clear if the abundance of 1 kda cod is an innate property of wastewater or if it is the result of conversion processes within the sewer more research is required to determine how universally applicable our findings are there are two practical lessons that can be learned from this study the first lesson relates to the characterization of wastewater for ags the majority of the soluble cod measured by filtration over a 0 45 µm filter is small enough to diffuse into ags this means that a simple characterization approach suffices to know which fraction of influent cod can be converted within the granules even though not all soluble cod is truly diffusible it is a reasonable approximation the benefit of a full ultrafiltration characterization is small especially considering the pitfalls of this method logan and jiang 1990 the second lesson relates to ags models the majority of ags models are based on simple substrates like vfas baeten et al 2019 ni and yu 2010 the diffusivity of these substrates is generally assumed to be 80 of their diffusivity in water nicolella et al 1998 wanner et al 2006 our findings show that the use of a single reduction factor for diffusion in granules is valid for molecules with a molecular weight up to 4000 da thus ags models do not require a unique reduction factor for each individual molecule however for a full consideration of diffusional aspects in ags charge and hydrophobicity aspects need to be studied as well 5 conclusion in this study the effect of the molecular weight of a solute on its diffusion coefficient in aerobic granules was evaluated next to the granule structure and the distribution of soluble cod in influent wastewater there was no statistically significant difference for the diffusion coefficients in water or granules for pegs with a molecular weight between 62 and 4000 da this indicates that within this molecular weight range diffusing molecules were only marginally obstructed by the granule matrix a 10 kda peg molecule was partially excluded from the granules and only accessed 65 of the granule volume the granule structure was heterogeneous with large macropores 10 µm diameter and semi solid regions that contained microbial cells the partial exclusion of the 10 kda peg suggests that the semi solid regions contain micropores with a diameter around 5 nm thus the diffusion results provide practical information but they also contribute to a characterization of the granule matrix interestingly a relatively large fraction 61 69 of the soluble cod in influent wastewater is lighter than 1 kda and thus can diffuse rapidly into the granules these findings can be used to simplify ags models and influent characterization approaches ags models do not need to consider the effect of molecular weight on the diffusion coefficients as for most molecules the diffusion coefficient in the granule is not significantly different from its diffusion coefficient in water the characterization of influent cod for ags reactors can suffice with a simple filtration with a 0 45 µm pore size filter as the majority of soluble cod in domestic wastewater is also diffusible inside aerobic granular sludge disclosure

19923,aerobic granular sludge ags is an advanced biofilm based technology for wastewater treatment diffusion of substrates into the granules is a key aspect of this technology domestic wastewater contains soluble organic substrates of different sizes that could potentially diffuse into the granules in this study the relation between the molecular weight of a substrate and its diffusion coefficient within the granule was studied with model substrates polyethylene glycols pegs with a molecular weight between 62 and 10 000 da the diffusion coefficients of the model substrates within granules from a full scale installation were measured with the transient uptake of a non reactive solute method the diffusion coefficients in the granules were not significantly different from the diffusion coefficients in water at least up to 4000 da molecular weight this indicates that these pegs were not obstructed by the granule matrix the 10 kda peg behaved differently from the lighter pegs as it could not penetrate the entire granule furthermore the granule structure was characterized with environmental scanning electron microscopy esem the granules displayed an open structure with large macropores and semi solid regions which contained microbial cells the diffusion results suggest that most diffusing molecules were unobstructed in the macropores and barely obstructed in the semi solid regions only the diffusion of the 10 kda peg seemed to be hindered by the semi solid regions but not by the macropores lastly the apparent molecular weight distribution of domestic wastewater soluble cod was determined with ultrafiltration membranes of 100 10 and 1 kda molecular weight cut off the influent fractionation revealed that a large part 61 69 of the influent soluble cod was lighter than 1 kda as molecules lighter than 1 kda diffuse easily the majority of the influent soluble cod can be considered as diffusible cod these findings provide new insight into the availability of influent cod for granular sludge graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords diffusion biofilms esem molecular weight aerobic granular sludge 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge ags is a recent innovation for the treatment of wastewater pronk et al 2015 the technology consists of microorganisms that produce extracellular polymeric substances eps to form granular biofilms or granules due to the limited penetration of oxygen into the granule different redox conditions can exist throughout the granule therefore nutrient removal processes such as nitrification denitrification and phosphorus uptake can occur simultaneously in a single reactor kishida et al 2009 wei et al 2014 sedimentation tanks are no longer needed due to the high settling velocity of the aerobic granules bengtsson et al 2018 as a result aerobic granular sludge technology requires less energy and land area compared to conventional activated sludge installations de bruin de kreuk van der roest uijterlinde and van loosdrecht 2004 pronk et al 2015 most ags research has been carried out with lab scale systems that were fed with small and soluble substrates like volatile fatty acids vfas or glucose adav et al 2008 de kreuk heijnen and van loosdrecht 2005 de sousa rollemberg et al 2018 these substrates can diffuse readily into the granules even into deeper zones pronk et al 2015 the diffusivity of the substrates has a major impact on the overall performance of granular sludge reactors layer et al 2019 a deep penetration of substrates will contribute to the formation of stable granules and to a high denitrification activity layer et al 2020 zheng et al 2006 at the same time often only a small fraction of real wastewater consists of small and soluble substrates the concentration of vfas in domestic wastewater is generally less than 10 of the influent chemical oxygen demand cod henze et al 1995 the other soluble substrates in the wastewater can account for 10 20 of the influent cod henze et al 1995 the exact nature and size of this non vfa soluble cod fraction is poorly understood soluble cod can be as small as acetate but also as large as a colloid up to 0 45 µm as a result the diffusion behaviour of the soluble cod in the granules is poorly understood as well diffusion in different biofilms has been researched extensively in the 1980s and the 1990s stewart 1998 however there are several limitations that hamper our knowledge on diffusion in biofilms and granules firstly most studies focused on small substrates like oxygen ammonium acetate and glucose chiu et al 2006 liu et al 2009 stewart 1998 only a handful of studies have measured diffusion coefficients of molecules that are heavier than 300 da bryers and drummond 1998 peulen and wilkinson 2011 takenaka et al 2009 thurnheer et al 2003 it is therefore not clear how the size of a solute affects its diffusion behaviour secondly different studies often yield diffusion coefficients that vary greatly stewart 1998 for example the mean relative effective diffusion coefficient dbiofilm daq for solutes with a molecular weight between 44 and 342 da was reported as 0 29 0 24 stewart 1998 this large variability is partially the result of differences in biofilm density between studies horn and morgenroth 2006 but it is not clear if other factors play a role as well lastly our knowledge on diffusion in biofilms is limited due to the inherent inaccuracy of the methods that are commonly used to measure diffusion coefficients van den berg van loosdrecht and de kreuk 2021 overall the understanding of diffusion in biofilms and granules is very limited especially regarding heavier molecules 300 da the objectives of this study were 1 to determine the effect of the molecular weight of a molecule on its diffusion coefficient in aerobic granules 2 to determine the pore structure of the granules and 3 to determine the distribution of soluble cod in different wastewaters the diffusion coefficients of different polyethylene glycols pegs uncharged model substrates with a molecular weight between 62 and 10 000 da were measured with the transient uptake of a non reactive solute method the diffusion behaviour was related to the granule structure observed by esem the distribution of soluble cod in domestic wastewater samples was determined through ultrafiltration with a 100 10 and 1 kda molecular weight cut off 2 materials and methods 2 1 granule source aerobic granules were harvested from the full scale nereda plant in utrecht the netherlands the plant treats domestic wastewater with a cod of 649 173 mg l a bod5 of 300 95 mg l and a tss of 297 95 mg l all average values with standard deviation during the 3 month sampling period the average sludge loading rate was 0 05 kg cod kg ds d the solids retention time was 20 50 days the reactor was operated with biological phosphate removal the sampled granules were sieved to retain only granules with size of 2 0 2 5 mm and afterward washed repeatedly to remove any non granular material washing of the granules was done in three steps first the granules were suspended in tap water second the granules were allowed to settle for a short time third the liquid on top of the granules was decanted these three steps were repeated around 5 10 times this way all material that did not settle well was removed from the granule sample the granules were stored in tap water at 4 c for a maximum of 2 weeks 2 2 diffusion experiments experiments to determine solute diffusion coefficients in aerobic granules were carried out with the transient uptake of a non reactive solute method westrin and zacchi 1991 the experiments were conducted with a working volume of 300 ml in a 500 ml jacketed glass vessel adequate mixing was provided by an orbital shaker heathrow scientific digital orbital shaker 19 2 mm orbit diameter 170 rpm the orbital shaker was chosen to limit granule breakage from excessive shear de graaff van dijk van loosdrecht and pronk 2018 the temperature was controlled at 4 0 0 1 c to limit biological activity two solutions were prepared for the experiment one with the granules and one with a specific molecule for the granule solution a certain amount of granules was added to a volumetric flask of 200 ml volume the amount of the granules was chosen to obtain an α value the ratio of water volume vw over granule volume vg of roughly 4 the flask was then filled to 200 ml with tap water for the specific molecule solution a known mass of a specific solute was added to 100 ml of tap water the solutions were pre chilled and added to the jacketed glass vessel quickly to start the experiment samples were taken at irregular intervals to best capture the non linear bulk liquid concentration profile over time for each experiment 25 samples of 0 5 ml were taken through modified pipette tips regular plastic 1 ml pipette tips were covered in a stainless steel woven mesh with a mesh size of 100 µm to prevent the granules from clogging the pipette tip the volume lost through sampling was immediately replaced by an equal amount of a solution with a concentration of the expected final solute value as described in nguyen and luong 1986 at the end of each experiment the temperature was increased to 20 c and the granule volume was determined with the modified dextran blue method van den berg pronk van loosdrecht and de kreuk 2021 finally total suspended solids and volatile suspended solids of the granules were determined according to standard methods apha 2005 polyethyleneglycols pegs of different molecular weight were used as solute in the diffusion experiment reagent grade pegs with average molecular weights of 62 106 200 300 400 600 1000 1500 2000 4000 and 10 000 da were obtained from merck the pegs with molecular weight of 62 and 106 da were monodisperse while the other pegs had a reported polydispersity index between 1 12 and 1 30 the initial peg concentration in each experiment was approximately 1 mg ml with the exact value determined for each experiment separately the diffusion coefficients of the different pegs were taken from waggoner et al 1995 2 3 data analysis the diffusion coefficients de of the molecules in the granules were derived from the concentration change in the bulk liquid if granules are initially free of substrate and the entire granule is accessible for diffusion the decrease in bulk liquid concentration can be described by the following equation crank 1975 1 c b t c b t 0 1 1 α α n 1 6 α 1 α exp d e q n 2 t r 2 9 9 α q n 2 α 2 here cb t is the bulk liquid concentration at time t r is the granule radius α is the ratio of liquid volume over granule volume and the qn s are the non zero positive roots of 2 tan q n 3 q n 3 α q n 2 the granule volume water volume total experimental volume granule volume and granule radius see section 2 6 were determined experimentally the initial solute concentration could not always be measured accurately in the experimental setup since diffusion of the solute into the granule started before the liquid volume concentration was completely homogeneous instead the initial concentration was calculated from the weight of solute added and the water volume in the experiment non linear least squares fitting of the diffusion model eq 1 to the experimental bulk liquid concentration data was used to find the best approximation for the diffusion coefficient in order to ensure that the global optimum was found rather than a local optimum random initial values were used repeatedly for each experiment 500 random initial values were used that varied between 1 10 13 and 2 10 9 m2 s 1 the precision of the diffusion coefficient was estimated according to the procedure of alper and gelb 1990 with this procedure the uncertainty in the granule radius granule volume and peg concentrations was propagated to the diffusion coefficient one thousand monte carlo simulations were used to approximate the standard deviation of the fitted diffusion coefficient the obtained diffusion coefficients at 4 c were all converted to corresponding values at 25 c based on einstein 1905 3 d 25 d 4 t 25 t 4 μ 4 μ 25 here d is the diffusion coefficient m2 s t is the absolute temperature k and µ is the dynamic viscosity of water 2 4 environmental scanning electron microscope analysis several granules were examined by environmental scanning electron microscopy esem to relate diffusion with the granule pore structure esem does not require desiccation or coating of the granules therefore the granules can be imaged without any pre processing and in a fully hydrated state a quanta feg 650 fei company usa was used with a gaseous secondary electron detector and a peltier cooling stage set at 0 5 c the granules were imaged at pressures between 3 and 7 mbar which corresponds to a relative humidity of 50 100 several granules were sliced into two halves with a scalpel to examine the inner structure of the granules with esem as well as reference sample alginate beads were included in the analysis the beads were prepared by dissolving sodium alginate sigma in demineralised water to a 2 w v solution and dripping this solution into a 2 5 w v cacl2 solution the alginate beads were allowed to harden for 30 min and subsequently stored in tap water 2 5 influent characterization influent samples from three wastewater treatment plants wwtp were analysed to determine the molecular weight distribution of the soluble organic fraction the influent samples originated from three wwtps in the netherlands all treating domestic wastewater from utrecht wwtp in utrecht 480 000 million population equivalents p e from harnaschpolder wwtp in den hoorn 1 3 million p e and from bath wwtp in rilland bath 485 000 p e these three wwtps were selected because of the different sewer systems utrecht wwtp is fed from a relatively short gravity sewer system harnaschpolder wwtp is fed from both short and longer pressure mains and bath wwtp is fed from a long pressure main around 44 of the influent to bath wwtp was industrial wastewater originating from petrochemical chemical and waste processing facilities flow proportional composite samples from a 24 h period were collected after the influent screening 6 mm the samples were collected in the months october november and january during dry weather flow conditions immediately after collection the samples were stored at 4 c for a maximum of 3 h prior to analysis after a brief settling period the samples were filtered in an amicon ultrafiltration cell merck millipore the filtration was carried out serially with a 0 45 µm filter durapore pvdf merck millipore and ultrafiltration membranes of 100 10 and 1 kda nominal molecular weight cut off ultracell regenerated cellulose merck millipore the membranes were treated according to the manufacturer s instructions the filtration was performed at 20 c and with a pressure of 2 bar from nitrogen gas 2 6 analytical methods chemical oxygen demand cod phosphate po4 p and ammonium nh4 n in the filtered wastewater samples were measured in triplicate with hach lange test kits the cod measurements was based on the dichromate method total suspended solids and volatile suspended solids in the wastewater samples were determined in triplicate according to standard methods apha 2005 vfa in the wastewater were analysed with high performance liquid chromatography hplc prominence shimadzu japan equipped with an ion exchange column aminex hpx 87h bio rad and a uv index detector spd 20a shimadzu japan sulphuric acid in ultrapure water 5 mm was used as eluent the individual vfa concentrations of acetate propionate and butyrate were converted to cod and lumped together to yield the total vfa concentration in mg cod l the concentration of peg samples was measured with the same hplc system equipped with two size exclusion chromatography columns in series suprema 5 µm 30 å pss gmbh germany and a refractive index detector rid 20a shimadzu japan ultrapure water was used as eluent at a flow rate of 0 8 ml min the size distribution of the granule samples was determined with a digital microscope keyence vhx 700f the microscope images were processed with imagej software to obtain a granule size distribution and an average aspect ratio schneider et al 2012 3 results 3 1 diffusion coefficients in ags the diffusion coefficients of different peg molecules within aerobic granules were determined with the transient uptake of a non reactive solute method each experiment yielded a bulk liquid concentration profile over time an average granule radius a granule volume and the liquid volume examples of the concentration profiles from the transient uptake experiments are given in fig 1 most concentration profiles followed a non linear decrease from the initial concentration c0 to the equilibrium concentration ceq there was no significant consumption of the solute during the experiments since consumption of the solute would result in a final concentration lower than the expected equilibrium concentration a detailed overview of the individual diffusion experiments is given in table a 1 and figure a 1 for the peg molecules between 62 and 4000 da the relative diffusion coefficient de daq in the granules was between 0 73 and 1 22 the diffusion coefficients of the pegs in the granule displayed large variability with standard deviations ranging from 28 to 34 these large standard deviations are probably the cause of the relative diffusion coefficient larger than 1 for peg200 400 1000 1500 and 4000 the diffusivity of pegs in the granule decreased logarithmically with the molecular weight of the pegs similar to the diffusivity of pegs in water see fig 2 the relation between diffusivity and molecular weight is given by 4 log d a log m w b here d is the diffusion coefficient mw is the molecular weight coefficient a is the slope and coefficient b is the intercept for peg diffusion in water the slope is 0 597 0 020 and the intercept is 7 951 0 077 waggoner et al 1995 for peg diffusion in the granules the slope and intercept found in this study are 0 564 0 044 and 8 070 0 126 respectively a t test revealed that the slope of granules and water were not significantly different from each other t 18 0 68 p 51 the same applied for the intercept t 18 0 81 p 43 thus the granule matrix had no significant effect on the diffusion of peg of all the tested molecular weights from 62 to 4000 da for almost all diffusion experiments the equilibrium concentration was equal to the expected equilibrium concentration this indicates that the concentration in the bulk liquid was equal to the final concentration in the whole granule there was one exception namely the 10 kda peg molecule see fig 1b the concentration in this experiment stabilized at a higher level than expected as a result no diffusion coefficient could be extracted from this experiment the diffusion model that is used to determine the diffusion coefficient see eq 1 requires that the expected equilibrium is reached the high equilibrium concentration in this experiment indicates that not all granule volume is accessible for this 10 kda molecule a mass balance of peg at the final equilibrium eq 5 showed that only 65 of the granule volume was accessible for this molecule mass 5 c eq f acce sible v g v w c 0 v w here faccesible is the fraction of the granule volume that is accessible for a molecule 3 2 characterization of the granules the hydrated structure of the granules was visualized with esem to gain insight into the medium through which the peg molecules diffused an overview of the collected esem images is given in fig 3 the images reveal a complex granule architecture the majority of the granule surface was heterogeneous and many large voids with a diameter of 10 20 µm were visible fig 3a c it is unclear exactly how far these voids penetrate into the granules still the lack of signal from these voids the black colour in the esem images suggests that they are not shallow the granule surface also showed thick strands that form a connected network these fibril like strands were of similar diameter as the microbial cells which are visible as well around 0 5 1 µm fig 3a c the length of the polymer strands was in the range of 10 30 µm some parts of the granule surface were much less heterogeneous and displayed dense clusters of cells underneath a smooth surface fig 3d however only a minority of the granule surface had this more homogeneous nature the inside of the granules was even more open than the granule surface fig 3e shows in the centre of the sliced granule the structure was almost completely open and large voids were visible the structure of the surface of alginate beads which were included as reference material was very different from that of the aerobic granules fig 3f the surface of the beads showed vein like structures which could be the result of shrinking during the preparation of the beads however aside from these structures the surface was completely smooth and no pores could be identified 3 3 influent characterization influent wastewater was collected from three wwtps the sewer systems feeding the wwtps differed in terms of hydraulic retention time and sewer type the wastewaters were all fractionated to reveal the apparent molecular weight distribution of soluble cod as can be seen in table 1 the three wastewaters showed similar characteristics the majority of the cod was present in the particulate form 62 77 around 15 26 of the total cod was present in the smallest size fraction which was below 1 kda in size only a minor fraction 11 12 of the influent cod was present in the fractions from 1 kda to 0 45 µm this means that the majority 61 69 of the soluble cod in all three wastewaters was lighter than 1 kda the vfas were only a minor fraction of the soluble cod 17 21 4 discussion 4 1 diffusion coefficients of peg molecules in the past many researchers have studied diffusion in biofilms there appeared to be a relation between the molecular weight of a solute and its relative diffusivity in biofilms the reported relative diffusivity of small solutes 44 da was 0 46 while that of large solutes 44 342 da was 0 39 stewart 1998 the relative diffusivities found in this study were much higher between 0 73 and 1 22 furthermore there was no discernible effect of the solute molecular weight on the relative diffusivity for molecules between 62 and 4000 da this is surprising as the molecular weight range used in this study is much greater than the molecular weight range included in the review of stewart 1998 one possible explanation for the discrepancy relates to the method used in this study the transient uptake of a non reactive solute method has been used previously to measure diffusion coefficients in hydrogel beads and biofilms chresand et al 1988 fan leyva ramos wisecarver zehner 1990 pu and yang 1988 the limitations of this method has been described previously highlighting the low precision as major issue van den berg van loosdrecht et al 2021 westrin and zacchi 1991 this low precision was observed here as well but it cannot explain the large difference between our results and the results described in literature alternatively the diffusion coefficients in this study could be overestimated due to systematic errors or biases however the effect of most systematic errors for this method is that the diffusion coefficient is underestimated van den berg van loosdrecht et al 2021 there are only two systematic errors that lead to an overestimation deactivation of the biomass and a non spherical granule shape we do not expect any bias from deactivation as we did not use deactivating chemicals the granule shape could have an influence as ellipsoidal granules have a higher surface to volume ratio than perfectly spherical granules as a result the concentration in the liquid decreases faster and the diffusion coefficient is overestimated if granules are assumed to be spherical however the average aspect ratio of the granules was only 1 44 our previous research has shown that this corresponds to an overestimation of the diffusion of only 10 van den berg van loosdrecht et al 2021 thus it is not likely that our findings significantly overestimate the diffusion coefficient in fact the diffusion coefficient could even be slightly underestimated due to the rough surface of the granule the granule size distribution or the mass transfer boundary layer van den berg van loosdrecht et al 2021 another explanation for the difference between our study and previous studies relates to the methods and types of biofilm used in the previous studies a thorough analysis of the studies included in the review of stewart 1998 revealed several issues see table a 1 for full details in total there were 21 studies on diffusion of larger molecules with molecular weight of 44 342 da from these 21 studies 12 used the steady state reaction method which is very imprecise and inaccurate van den berg van loosdrecht et al 2021 furthermore 5 out of the remaining 9 studies were performed on biofilms with a density greater than 150 g l it is not surprising that the diffusion coefficient in such a high density biofilm is much lower than in aerobic granules with a density of 90 g l horn and morgenroth 2006 the remaining 4 studies were performed with sludge flocs 3 or without considering biomass activity 1 as a result all studies on larger molecules that are included in stewart 1998 have clear limitations and a direct comparison with our findings is futile there are several studies not included in the review of stewart 1998 that focused on molecules in the kda range these studies are commonly carried out with fluorescent dextran molecules and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy or fluorescence recovery after photobleaching these techniques measure diffusion coefficients in specific locations in a biofilm instead of the average diffusion coefficients measured in this study several studies of kda sized molecules report high relative diffusivities for molecules between 3 and 10 kda in biofilms takenaka et al 2009 zhang et al 2011 and alginate beads favre et al 2001 puguan et al 2015 for example peulen and wilkinson 2011 found a relative diffusivity of 60 80 for a 3 kda and a 10 kda dextran in a pseudomonas fluorescens biofilm others reported relative lower diffusivities ranging from 0 01 to 0 23 for molecules with a molecular weight between 3 and 10 kda bryers and drummond 1998 lawrence et al 1994 marcotte et al 2004 thurnheer et al 2003 the reason behind this wide range in reported values is unclear but it could be due to differences in biofilm density or structure overall we believe our results are representative for diffusion in aerobic granules despite the large standard deviations the main result of the experiments are not the exact diffusion coefficients but rather the relation between the molecular weight and diffusion coefficient these results have been collected with the same method and the same type of biofilm thus even if the absolute diffusion coefficients would not be reliable the overall trend would remain the same as it turns out the granule matrix has no significant effect on peg molecules of 62 4000 da this conclusion is in contrast with existing literature and provides a new perspective on diffusion specifically in aerobic granules our study has focused on the molecular weight with neutrally charged molecules future research should investigate the effect of charge and hydrophobicity on diffusion in aerobic granules 4 2 granule structure the limited effect of the solute molecular weight on diffusion raised the question why the granule matrix did not provide more obstruction to the larger molecules to address this question we investigated the structure and porosity of the granule matrix with esem imaging in contrast to conventional electron microscopy esem does not require dehydration or fixation the granule therefore esem is an appropriate technique to visualize the eps matrix in its natural hydrated state priester et al 2007 the esem images of the granules see fig 3 revealed that the granules were very heterogeneous with arguably two distinct phases a liquid phase and a semi solid phase the liquid phase is present in large macropores that are visible on the granule surface and in the granule interior the semi solid phase in the granule was present in between the macropores and many microorganisms were embedded within this semi solid phase the presence of macropores or channels and cell clusters is an established observation in biofilm literature bryers and drummond 1998 marcotte et al 2004 peulen and wilkinson 2011 picioreanu et al 2016 sankaran et al 2019 takenaka et al 2009 generally porosity is used as a parameter to compare the volume of the macropores with the volume of the cell clusters however porosity in biofilms is an ill defined concept since both the liquid phase in the macropores as well as the semi solid phase mostly consists of water lewandowski 2000 diffusion occurs both in the macropores and in the semi solid phase the size of micropores in the semi solid phase could not be determined with esem imaging however alginate hydrogels have a typical pore size of 5 20 nm boontheekul et al 2005 leal egaña et al 2011 simpliciano et al 2013 smidsrød and skja 1990 the size of the micropores in the granules could be of a similar order of magnitude since alginate gels are similar to the eps from ags felz et al 2020 lin et al 2010 schambeck et al 2020 the hydrodynamic radius of the pegs used in this study ranged from 0 15 to 2 79 nm devanand and selser 1991 thus the pegs were three orders of magnitude smaller than the granule macropores it is therefore highly likely that the pegs diffused completely unobstructed within the macropores at the same time the pegs were only slightly smaller than the hypothesized pore size of the granule micropores still the diffusion experiments indicated that the pegs with molecular weight up to 4000 da 1 65 nm hydrodynamic radius penetrated throughout the entire granule as the expected equilibrium concentration was reached given that the expected equilibrium was not reached with 10 kda peg it is possible that this molecule was excluded from the micropores the hydrodynamic radius of the 10 kda peg is 2 79 nm devanand and selser 1991 which means that the diameter of the micropores might be around 5 nm still the micropores are apparently large enough to allow diffusion of pegs up to a molecular weight of 4000 da or a hydrodynamic radius up to 1 65 nm the notion that macropores or channels significantly enhance diffusion into the granules is therefore incorrect for molecules lighter than 4000 da for these molecular weights diffusion in the macropores is only marginally faster than diffusion in the micropores in contrast molecules that are excluded from the micropores can only diffuse in the macropores the heterogeneity of the granules is therefore mainly of relevance for heavier molecules 4 kda this discussion highlights that diffusion behaviour in the granules is closely linked to the structure of the eps matrix our results are therefore not universally applicable to all biofilm types the aerobic granules used in this study have a distinct heterogeneous structure with macropores 10 20 µm in diameter and fibrils biofilms with alginate as major component might have a structure more similar to alginate beads see fig 3f and the diffusive behaviour in these biofilms can be very different it is therefore of utmost importance that studies of diffusion in biofilms describe both the diffusion behaviour and the structure of the eps matrix 4 3 implications for practice an important question in the design and operation of ags systems is which fraction of influent cod can rapidly diffuse into the granules during the anaerobic phase of the sequencing batch cycle pronk et al 2015 this diffusible fraction is important for granule formation and for nutrient removal layer et al 2019 the lack of a significant effect of the granule matrix on the relative diffusivity de daq suggests that even larger molecules up to 4000 da are likely to be available for conversion within the granules because of their size larger molecules already diffuse slower in water than small molecules but the granule matrix does not limit their diffusion further we can evaluate the transient penetration of a molecule into a granule with the following equation crank 1975 6 c c b 1 2 n 1 1 n exp d e n 2 π 2 t r 2 here c is the concentration in the granule core cb is the concentration in the bulk liquid r is the granule radius de is the diffusion coefficient and t is the time this equation can be used to estimate the concentration in the granule core after a certain time period we can estimate the diffusive penetration after 60 min which is the length of the anaerobic feeding period for most ags reactors de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 pronk et al 2015 the diffusive penetration is expressed by the relative concentration in the granule core c cb with the diffusion coefficients that were found in this study for 62 4000 da pegs granules with a 1 mm radius and a temperature of 10 c the relative concentration in the granule core c cb ranges from 54 to 100 after 60 min all molecules of 1 kda and lighter reach a relative concentration in the granule core of at least 93 of the concentration in the bulk the molecules between 1 kda and 4 kda penetrate less and reach a c cb between 47 and 93 of course the in situ penetration depth depends on both the diffusive properties as well as the consumption rate still this analysis shows that for many molecules with different size diffusion does not limit penetration depth the above analysis has even stronger implications if the distribution of soluble cod is considered of the soluble cod in the three analysed wastewater samples 61 69 was lighter than 1 kda and 70 87 was lighter than 10 kda this means that at least 61 69 of the soluble cod can diffuse easily into the granules it is therefore likely that the majority of the soluble cod is converted within the granules where it can contribute to nutrient removal layer et al 2019 2020 nevertheless the composition of wastewater can vary significantly between different locations henze and harremoës 1992 we found a similar cod distribution for three wastewaters which originated from different sewer systems in the netherlands nevertheless similar soluble cod distributions were found by other authors for domestic textile tannery and agricultural wastewaters doğruel 2012 dulekgurgen et al 2006 hu et al 2002 karahan et al 2008 ravndal et al 2018 it is however not clear if the abundance of 1 kda cod is an innate property of wastewater or if it is the result of conversion processes within the sewer more research is required to determine how universally applicable our findings are there are two practical lessons that can be learned from this study the first lesson relates to the characterization of wastewater for ags the majority of the soluble cod measured by filtration over a 0 45 µm filter is small enough to diffuse into ags this means that a simple characterization approach suffices to know which fraction of influent cod can be converted within the granules even though not all soluble cod is truly diffusible it is a reasonable approximation the benefit of a full ultrafiltration characterization is small especially considering the pitfalls of this method logan and jiang 1990 the second lesson relates to ags models the majority of ags models are based on simple substrates like vfas baeten et al 2019 ni and yu 2010 the diffusivity of these substrates is generally assumed to be 80 of their diffusivity in water nicolella et al 1998 wanner et al 2006 our findings show that the use of a single reduction factor for diffusion in granules is valid for molecules with a molecular weight up to 4000 da thus ags models do not require a unique reduction factor for each individual molecule however for a full consideration of diffusional aspects in ags charge and hydrophobicity aspects need to be studied as well 5 conclusion in this study the effect of the molecular weight of a solute on its diffusion coefficient in aerobic granules was evaluated next to the granule structure and the distribution of soluble cod in influent wastewater there was no statistically significant difference for the diffusion coefficients in water or granules for pegs with a molecular weight between 62 and 4000 da this indicates that within this molecular weight range diffusing molecules were only marginally obstructed by the granule matrix a 10 kda peg molecule was partially excluded from the granules and only accessed 65 of the granule volume the granule structure was heterogeneous with large macropores 10 µm diameter and semi solid regions that contained microbial cells the partial exclusion of the 10 kda peg suggests that the semi solid regions contain micropores with a diameter around 5 nm thus the diffusion results provide practical information but they also contribute to a characterization of the granule matrix interestingly a relatively large fraction 61 69 of the soluble cod in influent wastewater is lighter than 1 kda and thus can diffuse rapidly into the granules these findings can be used to simplify ags models and influent characterization approaches ags models do not need to consider the effect of molecular weight on the diffusion coefficients as for most molecules the diffusion coefficient in the granule is not significantly different from its diffusion coefficient in water the characterization of influent cod for ags reactors can suffice with a simple filtration with a 0 45 µm pore size filter as the majority of soluble cod in domestic wastewater is also diffusible inside aerobic granular sludge disclosure

19924,water residence time which is affected by increasing water demands and climate change plays a crucial role in lakes and reservoirs since it influences many natural physical and ecological processes that eventually impact the water quality of the waterbody thus accurate quantification of the water residence time and its distribution is an important tool in lake management in this study we present a novel approach for assessing the residence time in lakes and reservoirs the approach is based on the leslie matrix model that was originally developed for the analysis of age structured biological population dynamics in this approach the water in the lake is divided into different age classes each representing the time since the parcel of water entered the lake and provides an overall picture of the water age structure the traditional approach for calculating residence times which relies only on the lake volume and annual inflow or outflow volumes thereby disregarding any previous information is very sensitive to large interannual variation while the proposed approach produces the fraction and volume distribution curves of all age classes within the lake for each simulated timestep thus in addition to mean residence time the fraction of young water fyw quantifying the young fraction of water in the lake can be analyzed the same is true for any other age class of water the approach was applied to lake kinneret sea of galilee historical data collected over 32 years 1987 2018 and for prediction of long term time series based on several future scenarios inflows and outflows it offers a more accurate quantification of the mean residence time of water in a lake and can easily be adapted to other waterbodies comparison of simulation results may serve as basis for determining the lake s management policy by controlling the inflows and outflows that will affect both the mean residence time and the fraction of young old age classes of water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords mean residence time hydraulic age distribution fraction of young water leslie matrix model management policy lake kinneret data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction increasing water demands from lakes and reservoirs in arid and semi arid regions due to population growth agricultural irrigation and economic activities in addition to changes in climate patterns result in significant fluctuations in the volume and depth of waterbodies these affect the physical hydrological and ecological processes in the aquatic ecosystem li et al 2010 climate change models for the mediterranean region predict a 25 30 decrease in precipitation and higher evaporation by the end of the twenty first century accompanied by even stronger reduction in annual runoff volumes in rural areas erol and randyr 2012 in addition occurrence of extreme events is expected to increase e g flooding extended droughts which will magnify the seasonal and multiannual water level fluctuations creating hydrological stresses such as prolonged hydraulic retention time in lakes jeppesen et al 2015 thus understanding lakes and reservoirs hydrodynamic processes and characteristics under varying water levels is essential for determination of optimal management policy however simple monitoring and flows and fluxes analyses may produce difficulties in gaining valuable information on the ecosystem s functioning deleersnijder et al 2001 therefore estimating a specific time scale analysis variable is often used such as water age and residence time both of which have been widely applied to numerous waterbodies e g qi et al 2016 viero and defina 2016 liu et al 2012 li et al 2010 monsen et al 2002 deleersnijder et al 2001 delhez et al 1999 etc water age and residence time are conducive variables used for estimating water mass exchange and can also be treated as effective factors for investigating patterns of water quality in lakes and reservoirs zimmerman 1976 defines residence time as the time it takes for any water parcel of the sample to leave the waterbody through its outlet and water age as the time it has spent since entering the waterbody through one of the boundaries water age is therefore defined by spatial heterogeneity particles at different locations within a water body will have different ages monsen et al 2002 water age and residence time naturally complement each other and while age traces water according to when it entered the domain of interest residence time follows the water until it leaves it delhez et al 2014 water time scale variables play a key parameter in limnology affecting biochemical processes nutrient concentrations and water quality in general for example more than 40 years ago vollenweider 1976 developed a regression relationship for average planktonic agal chlorophyll concentration as a function of the annual phosphorusload normalized by waterbody area mean depth and hydraulic residence time for a group of european waterbodies several studies have reported on a significant positive correlation between chlorophyll a concentration in the surface water layer and the time scale variables residence time or water age zou et al 2020 gao et al 2018 qi et al 2016 etc zhang et al 2010 demonstrated that an increase in time scale values yielded a decrease in dissolved organic matter and an increase in water salinity maavara et al 2018 who developed a mechanistic model to predict n2o emmission through nitrification and denitrification in various water bodies reported that a water residence time kinetically limits the extent of these processes in waterbodies other studies investigated the relationship between residence time and the availability of nutrients such as the significant impact of residence time on the total nitrogen change rates in waterbodies tong et al 2019 furthermore increase in cyanobacteria biomass was positively associated with retention time for various lake types such as humic and clear lakes richardson et al 2018 recently zhao et al 2022 who studied the effects of water residence time on nitrogen fixation reported that short lake water residence time can severely inhibit nitrogen fixation capacity by inhibiting the growth of nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria and hence may serve as management tool for controlling cyanobacteria growth and eutrophication development these publications demonstrated the effect of time scale variables on lake ecology and as consequence on lake water quality and may therefore provide a quantitative tool to support the management policy of lakes methods for estimating these time scale variables water age and residence time rely on in situ tracer studies or on different type of models for example kratzer and biagtan 1997 used dye tracer rhodamine and followed its movement downstream and indicated that the average tracer travel time at a downstream location was higher than the average tracer travel time at an upstream station in other words at each site the dye tracer arrived at different times resulting in longer or shorter travel times compared to average time other studies have used computerized tools mainly numerical hydrodynamic models for modeling time scales most of them three dimensional models that included fluid dynamics modules e g qi et al 2016 li et al 2010 zhang et al 2010 monsen et al 2002 deleersnijder et al 2001 delhez et al 1999 these tools are resource intensive and require preliminary preparation of the model settings in addition to its calibration and verification skilled users and sufficient computational resources in this study we present a novel approach for estimating the water age distribution and residence time in lakes the approach is based on the leslie matrix model that was originally developed for the analysis of age structured biological population dynamics leslie 1945 the approach has been modified and applied to non steady state reactors and treated wastewater storage reservoirs juanico and friedler 1994 and can provide information on the hydraulic age distribution of the lake or reservoir the leslie matrix model leslie 1945 is a deterministic model widely used to assess the age structure of populations e g iwasaki et al 2010 bergek et al 2012 and the references therein monte 2018 and the references therein sun et al 2021 briefly this model classifies individuals in a population into age classes population density is observed at regularly spaced times and is partitioned into several age classes the number of individuals in each age class is calculated at each timestep based on 1 survival rate the fraction of individuals in the current timestep that survive until the next timestep these advance from age class x to age class x 1 2 effective fertility the number of offspring born to an individual parent in age class x that survive until the next census 3 harvesting mechanism that specifies the harvesting policy of the population which can be defined independently for each age class e g how many trees from each age class the forestry industry can fell in a given tree stock these can be expressed by two matrices the leslie matrix representing the first two transformation laws and the harvesting matrix representing the harvesting policy following these steps the age structure of the population can be represented by a vector at any time water in lakes can be considered as a population divided into different age classes each representing the time since a conceptual parcel of water entered the lake this concept of dividing lake water to different parcels having different transport time has been addressed in the literature e g qi et al 2016 monsen et al 2002 zimmerman 1976 in this study we modified the leslie matrix model to represent the population dynamics as a water age structure within a non steady state flow lake ecosystem the water age distribution allows us to estimate the mean residence time of water in the lake and to analyze the water age structure at given times we applied the developed approach to the sub tropical lake kinneret sea of galilee with data collected over 32 years 1987 2018 and then used the method to evaluate the effect of long term future management scenarios on the age of the water in the lake 2 methodology 2 1 model description 2 1 1 the main concept when applying the leslie matrix model to a lake the water volume in the lake is divided into groups based on age classes where at each timestep the volume and the fraction of each age class is quantified in this case survival in the leslie matrix model represents water that remains in the lake i e the water that does not evaporate or flow out from the lake analogous to natural mortality in the modified model water which enters the lake at each timestep plays the role of fertility producing young water in the lake while water withdrawals are analogous to harvesting 2 1 2 description of the modified model in the leslie matrix model at each timestep the number of living individuals is quantified for each age class similarly the modified model estimates the water volume of each age class by using two indexes i 1 n which counts the number of timesteps and j 1 k which counts the number of age classes and the model estimates the water volume in each age class j during the time interval i in the original model in parallel to shifting forward in timesteps individuals that survive move from one age class to the next older age class getting older individuals that do not survive leave the class and are subtracted from the population in the modified model when shifting forward in timesteps a certain amount of water leaves the lake e g withdrawals evaporation river outflow etc and the water volume is reduced analogous to natural mortality and harvesting the remaining water the survivors progresses in the age classes and moves to the next class thereby getting older which in essence is equivalent to water residing for a longer time in the lake similar to the original leslie matrix model where offspring are added to the population as the youngest age class in the modified model inflows to the lake enter the youngest age class this is because inflows are the newest water added to the lake and are thus considered the youngest class at each timestep as an example if the model timestep is one year then the inflow is defined at the end of the interval as age class 1 which is one year old that is to say the water stays in the lake for one year assuming completely mixed conditions water outflow mortality and harvesting see above from each age class is proportional to its fractional volume completely mixed conditions can be assumed if the timestep is similar or longer than the lake mixing cycle i e for a monomictic lake such as lake kinneret berman et al 2014 the timestep should be at least one year it should be noted that we are fully aware of some possible short circuiting in the water flow i e water may enter and leave the epilimnion during the stratified period however accounting this will require a much more detailed and complex calculation and finer time steps with much richer data requirements such inflow water density density of the epilimnion etc the required input data for the modified model includes the initial lake volume vinitial scalar analogous to the total initial population and water flow data i e water entering offspring the lake during the determined timestep and leaving mortality and harvesting the lake during this timestep therefore if the timestep is one year the input data for inflows qi in i 1 n and outflows qi out i 1 n are annual flows 2 2 model development the age distribution of the water is constructed in steps assuming that the lake water is divided into k age classes if vi j volume of water in age class j at time i and fi j fractional volume of age class j at time i then eq 1 defines the relationship between the two where vi total is the total volume of the lake at time i eq 2 1 f i j v i j v i total 2 v i total j 1 k v i j combining eqs 1 and 2 yields the following expression 3 j 1 k f i j 1 if completely mixed conditions are assumed outflow water withdrawals natural stream outflows and evaporation from each age class is proportional to its fractional volume 4 q i j out q i out f i j where q i j out is the outflow volume that leaves age class j at the end of timestep i and qi out is the total outflow from the lake at time interval i inflows only enter the youngest age class in our case it is assumed the inflows enter the lake at the beginning of each time interval and part of it leaves the lake by the end of the time interval the volume of the lake at the end of each time interval is given by 5 v i total v i 1 total q i in q i out where v i 1 total is the total volume of the lake at time i 1 let the mid interval total lake volume v m e a n i total be defined as the arithmetic mean of the volume at the beginning and at the end of each time interval 6 v m e a n i total v i 1 total v i total 2 note v i 1 total is the total lake volume at the beginning of time interval i which is equal to the total volume at the end of time interval i 1 the age classes of water in the lake may be classified into the following two types 1 youngest age class j 1 which contains water that entered the lake at time interval i 2 age classes j 1 2 2 1 youngest age class j 1 since we assumed that inflows enter the youngest class j 1 at the beginning of each time interval and part of it leaves the lake by the end of the time interval the volume of this class is modified over the course of the time interval 7 v i 1 q i in q i 1 o u t combination of eqs 1 4 and 7 when using the mean lake volume yields an expression for the fractional volume of age class 1 at the end of time interval i 8 f i 1 q i in v mean i t o t a l q i o u t 2 2 2 age class j 1 the volume of the j th class by the end of time interval i can be expressed as 9 v i j v i 1 j 1 q i j o u t where v i 1 j 1 is the volume of age class j 1 at time interval i 1 note that moving from time interval i 1 to i age class j 1 gets older and becomes age class j now similar to 8 combination of 1 4 and 9 when using the mean lake volume yields an expression for the fractional volume of age class j 10 f i j v i 1 j 1 v mean i t o t a l q i o u t fig 1 illustrates the framework of the model water from age class 1 at timestep 1 which remained in the lake survived aged by one year and is present at timestep 2 in age class 2 it should be noted that the volume and fraction of this class are smaller than the volume at timestep 1 since some of the volume of the age class left the lake and the total lake volume has changed at the end of the simulation two matrixes are obtained one describes the volume of each age class and the other expresses the age classes fractional volumes for each timestep fig 1 each vertical vector column of these two matrixes represents a timestep while each horizontal vector row defines the age of the class namely if the simulation timestep is one year then each vertical vector is a different year where row 1 describes age class of year one row 2 represents age class of 2 years and so on the fraction matrix obtained can be used to calculate the mean residence time τi based on the age structure for each timestep each simulation year as follows 11 τ i 1 f 1 i 2 f 2 i k f k i j 1 k j f j i where f j i is the fraction of each age class j at timestep i and k is the maximum age class which contains the oldest water in the lake that is k years old or older for example assuming that three timesteps are modeled and the fractions of age class 1 2 and 3 are 0 3 0 6 and 0 1 respectively it should be noted that age class 3 contains the oldest water in the lake which entered the lake three years earlier and age class 1 contains the youngest water in the lake hence the average age of the water or the mean residence time is 1 8 years 0 3 1 0 6 2 0 1 3 2 3 study site lake kinneret sea of galilee is a meso eutrophic lake with mean annual primary production of 650 gc m 2 berman et al 1995 located at an elevation of about 210 m i e 210 m below mean sea level in the northern part of the dead sea rift valley part of the afro syrian rift series the lake is 22 km long and 12 km wide at maximum width when full the maximum and mean depths are 44 and 24 m respectively and its surface area is 170 km2 lake kinneret is a warm monomictic lake and due to its importance its inflows and outflows are continuously monitored by israel water authority iwa and by mekorot israel s national water company the lake receives inflows average of 600 mcm y million cubic meters per year during the years 1987 2018 from 6 main sources including the jordan river with an average of 390 mcm y and approximately 70 of the inflows gal et al 2003 direct rain with an average of 66 mcm y and direct runoff averaging 62 mcm y the lake outflow is composed of five sinks where the major ones are the national water carrier nwc with an average of 250 mcm y and evaporation with an average of 240 mcm y while only about 10 mcm y exits the lake through its natural outlet to the southern jordan river since the mid 1990s the lake ecosystem has undergone a number of significant limnological changes zohary 2004 gal and williamson 2010 zohary and ostrovsky 2011 including five consecutive drought years between the winter of 2013 14 to 2017 8 that exhibited extremely low inflows into the lake and as a result low outputs mainly low intake to the nwc and a declining water level tal 2019 lachmani 2019 2 4 model application 2 4 1 initial conditions and baseline simulation as lake kinneret is monomictic we assess the lake water age distribution residence time using a one year timestep the calculations are made for hydrological years which start on 1st october and ends on 30th september the following year data used in this study were collected as part of the on going lake kinneret monitoring program sukenik et al 2014 and included annual inflow and outflow data for 32 years over from 1987 through 2018 a lake water volume of 3 755 mcm estimated for october 1 1987 served as the initial volume at the beginning of the simulation the structure of the water age classes in the lake is not known hence all water receives an age of one year during the simulation of the first years age classes are constructed during each timestep the age class structure is not stable and contains only a limited number of age classes therefore the model requires a spin up period this was achieved by repeated simulation of the year 1987 for 100 times at equilibrium conditions inflow outflow so the lake volume on october 1st did not change between years the structure of the water age classes in the lake obtained after 100 timesteps was used as an initial condition for the simulation and then calculated for each year over a period of 32 years 1987 2018 2 4 2 future scenarios israel water authority iwa the body that manages the lake developed a strategic plan for protecting the lake ecosystem in coming decades 2018 2050 in order to cope with extended drought periods iwa 2018 tal 2019 the strategic plan followed an unprecedented five year drought in northern israel which resulted in decreasing flows in the streams feeding the lake to the lowest ever recorded lachmani et al 2019 and a lake level closest to the lowest ever recorded under the assumption that climate change will continue gal et al 2020 and intensify in the lake region tal 2019 the strategic plan includes importing excess desalinated water from the national water supply system into the lake to evaluate the potential impact of climate change on inflows into the lake and water demand from the lake thirty different long term time series predicting the inflow and outflows entering and leaving the lake for the years 2020 2050 were developed by iwa based on rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 iwa israel water authority 2018a the long term time series realizations referred to the predicted regional water demand in addition to climate change effects expressed by elevated air temperature reduced precipitation and lower inflows to and outflows from the lake while all realizations had the same characteristics they were shifted by one year resulting in a displacement in the timing of peaks and minima in addition there was an annual inflow decrease of 10 mcm y over the course of the simulation period the average predicted overall inflows and outflows for 2020 2060 were 515 mcm y for both inflow and outflow which is approximetly 100 mcm y less in comparison to 2000s the strategic plan prescribed that an additional annual volume of imported water that will be added to the lake during a certain year will be utilized during the same year importing water to the lake will be executed gradually starting with an addition of about 10 mcm y in 2023 and reaching its maximum in 2050 this was planned under two possible scenarios table 1 that included 1 importing the excess water directly into the lake lake scenario reaching a maximum 304 mcm y in 2050 and averaging 184 mcm y over the entire period 2030 2050 and 2 adding part of the imported water directly into the lake and part to streams in the upper part of the lake s watershed watershed scenario a portion of which will drain through the natural drainage system into the lake in this case water addition to the lake will reach a maximum 245 mcm y by 2050 and average 129 mcm y over the whole period the two scenarios as well as business as usual bau scenario in which no water is imported into the lake from external sources were compared by assessing the age distribution of the water within the lake over the period of the realizations thirty long term time series forecasting inflow and outflow to the lake during the years 2020 2050 were established by iwa for each scenario the long term time series forecasting were extended to year 2060 in order to study a longer period and to analyze the effect of water import at the end of the period these data served as input for the three scenarios creating a total of 90 model simulations 2 5 model output analysis the developed model was initially applied to data collected from lake kinneret during the years 1987 2018 than it was used for analyzing future scenarios we then will focus on two very different years including a high 2013 and low inflow year 2018 while 2013 was a rainy year that experienced large inflows into the lake 776 mcm y lachmani et al 2019 2018 was a dry year following 5 consecutive drought years 2014 2018 with inflows between 312 390 mcm y lachmani et al 2019 3 results 3 1 model implementation for the years 1987 2018 3 1 1 analysis of the age structure in the lake 1987 2018 the age structure obtained by the water age distribution approach shows as expected that for each examined year some of the water had resided in the lake for a long time while some was younger the fraction of young water fyw is a quantification of the young fraction of water in the lake modified from juanico and friedler 1994 for example fyw10 is the fractional volume of water that has resided 1 10 years in the lake expressed as a proportion of total lake volume fig 2 a analysis of fyws for varying ages highlights the differences in response to dry and wet years as expected when inflows were higher the fyws increased and vice versa during dry years fig 2b during the 1992 hydrological year for example inflows and outflows were very high 1 526 and 980 mcm y respectively resulting in fyw2 36 and fyw15 100 i e practically all water in the lake was younger than 15 years on the other hand in 2001 inflows and outflows were much lower with values of 558 mcm y and 468 mcm y representing approximetly 30 and 50 of the outflows in 1992 respectively as a consequence in 2001 only 15 of the water was 2 years old i e 85 older than 2 years old and as little as 18 of the water was older than 15 years 3 1 2 mean residence time 1987 2018 for each simulated period the mean residence time was calculated based on the age structure approach eq 11 the mean residence time of the water in the lake increased by 24 over the period 1987 2018 from 6 6 years in 1987 to 8 6 years in 2018 fig 3 with linear slope of 0 05 y 1 r2 0 67 p 0 005 over the course of this period inflows to and outflows from the lake significantly changed and affected the mean residence time which increased and decreased inversely to the flows for example in 1992 the inflow and the outflow were very high therefore the mean residence time was low 6 8 years on the other hand during the dry 2001 the mean residence time was higher 7 3 years from 2013 onwards the mean residence time steadily increased as a result of five consecutive dry years due to low inflows and as a result minimal water extraction as a consequence the linear increase in mean residence time calculated for the 2013 2018 drought period was 0 3 y 1 r2 0 98 p 0 005 calculation of the traditional residence time lake volume divided by the total inflow or outflow wetzel 2001 for the simulated years inversely followed the inflows and yielded a much more notable variation between the simulated years compared to mean residence time calculated according to the age distribution approach the increase in residence time during the 1987 2018 period based on the traditional calculation was from 4 2 1987 to 10 9 y 2018 or from 6 2 1987 to 9 5 y 2018 depending if inflows or outflows were used respectively in these cases the change represents at least a 259 and 152 increase in residence time over that period based on inflows and outflows respectively 3 1 3 2013 and 2018 the high inflows of the year 2013 entered age class 1 and after subtracting the relative outflows leaving the class during the time interval age class 1 constituted about 15 of the total volume of water in the lake fig 4 a for 2013 age class 1 is the largest one followed by an almost exponential reduction of the water volumes of the following age classes in the case of steady inflows and outflows an exponential trend is expected since during every timestep of the simulation the volumes of the age classes decrease due to outflows therefore an older class would become smaller and smaller for more details see juanico and friedler 1994 on the other hand in 2018 the age class volumes distribution was not as orderly as in 2013 as it followed five consecutive drought years 2014 2018 with low inflows into the lake these low inflows are well noticed fig 4b and are expressed in age classes 1 5 2018 to 2014 respectively especially in relation to the relative fraction of the same age classes in 2013 fig 4a the high inflow of 2013 is clearly pronounced as age class 6 in 2018 though by 2018 the class 6 containing the 2013 inflows was smaller than when it first entered the lake a total decline of 249 mcm it was nevertheless the largest class representing 10 of the volume of water in the lake as opposed to only 7 of age class 1 2018 inflows 3 2 model prediction for the years 2020 2060 as aforementioned section 2 4 above the water age distribution approach developed in this study was applied to proposed water importing scenarios developed by the iwa using 30 long term time series forecasting of inflow and outflow to and from the lake during the projection period an example for the input and output of one time series is shown in fig 5 for all three scenarios the results show that the bau scenario is substantially different than the two other scenarios starting from 2030 inflows and outflows are typically much lower than the ones projected for the two water import scenarios with an average difference of about 100 mcm y consequently a higher mean residence time is predicted for the bau scenario for the bau scenario the water exchange is low and the mean residence time considerably increases with time reaching 12 6 y in 2060 compared to 8 0 y in 2000 moreover the gap between its value and the mean residence time for the two other scenarios increases over time the maximum difference between the mean residence time predicted for the bau and the lake and watershed scenarios in 2060 was 3 4 and 2 7 y respectively the difference between the lake and watrershed scenarios is less pronounced but consistently increases over time from no difference in 2030 to a difference of 0 25 y 3 difference in 2040 and a maximum difference of 0 8 y 10 difference in 2060 for each water import scenario bau lake watershed the model was executed over 30 time series and thus predicted 30 solutions for each simulated year creating three ranges of possible results one for each scenario fig 6 a the increase in the mean residence time over the simulated period for the bau scenario is obvious in all 30 predicted time series rangingfrom 8 0 8 3 y in 2020 to 10 3 13 0 y in 2060 the end of the forecast period as water is planned to be imported starting from 2030 the mean residence times of all three scenarios overlap until 2031 and then deviate from each other the maximum difference in mean residence times between the examined scenarios occurred at the end of the predicted period 2060 with 5 and 4 year differences between bau and lake and bau and watershed scenarios respectively these gaps over the period 2032 2060 were found to be statistically significant ancova p 0 05 the fyw10 in 2020 for all three alternatives ranged between 67 to 86 meaning that about 13 34 of the water resided in the lake longer than 10 years fig 6b since the forecast predicts a long term decrease in inflows and outflows throughout the period the obtained fwy10 also decreased signifying a larger volume of water residing in the lake longer than 10 years for example the fyw10 in 2040 ranged between 54 to 70 for the bau scenario and being higher for the other two scenarios with 63 76 and 65 79 for watershed and lake scenarios respectively in 2060 the fyw10 decreased by 5 6 for the bau alternative while a more moderate reduction was obtained for the watershed 3 4 and lake up to 3 scenarios compared to 2040 analysis of the solutions for the lake and watershed scenarios indicated similarity in the mean residence times from 2020 to 2038 from 2039 a statistically significant difference is observed between the mean residence times of these two scenarios ancova p 0 05 despite the relatively small differences in annual inflows in the two scenarios average difference of about 40 mcm y the cumulative impact of the differences over time results is a statistically significant difference of up to 2 y in the mean residence time in 2060 25 difference 4 discussion the novel approach presented here for estimating the lake mean residence time accounts for the relative annual contribution of all inputs and outputs of water into a lake the results show that flows changed significantly over the simulated period while changes to the mean residence time were much less pronounced and as expected its value slightly increased during dry years with low flows and vice versa the traditional residence time calculated by the ration of lake volume to total inflow or outflow is a well known method in limnology wetzel 2001 it is however a simplification of the complex calculation of the real residence time since it re calculates the residence time each year without considering previous years i e the calculation does not account for the residence time at the beginning of the year thus it can be suitable only for lakes and reservoirs operating under steady or quasi steady state where inflows and outflows do not differ significantly from one year to another so with the traditional calculation an extremely dry year would provide an estimated very long residence time for a lake though the previous years may have been extremely wet with very high inflows in contrast the developed mean residence time calculation includes a memory component as it depends on past data of the examined period and therefore provides a more realistic and accurate solution for example calculating the traditional residence time based on inflow for the consecutive years 1991 and 1992 yielded 9 y and 3 y respectively fig 2 a gap of 6 years caused by the high inflows during 1992 that had inflows and outflows of 1 526 and 980 mcm y respectively compared to 1991 which had inflows and outflows of 430 mcm y the traditional theoretical residence time in 1992 does not consider the effect of the preceding three year drought and relies only on the high inflow during 1992 and therefore it dramatically decreases in 1992 on the other hand the water age distribution approach which accounts for conditions through previous years yielded quite similar values of 7 6 and 7 7 y for 1991 and 1992 respectively the water age distribution approach yielded the definition of the fraction of young water fyw where fyws increased with increasing flows and vice versa decreased during dry years the significant change in inflows during 1991 1992 is well noticed in the calculated fyws fig 2 therefore for a better understanding of the overall picture both parameters should be analyzed mean residence time and fyws our approach provides an overall picture of the water age classes distribution obtained for each year of the simulation as was illustrated for 2013 and 2018 fig 4 these data allowed us to compare between years and to draw conclusions regarding age classes and the residence time of the water in the lake for example in 2013 50 of the water resided in the lake five years or less obtained by summing the fraction of age classes 1 5 in contrast in 2018 only 28 of the water resided in the lake 5 years or less while 72 had been in the lake longer than 5 years namely the water in the lake was much younger during 2013 compared to 2018 when inflows and outflows are low the water mass exchange is poor and the water resides in the lake much longer than during years with high inflows and outflows when higher water mass exchange generates a high proportion of younger water age classes fig 2b the mean residence time calculated by the new approach for 1987 2018 was less sensitive to fluctuations in the annual inflows and outflows than the fyw this is due to the fact that the mean residence time depends on the complete hydraulic age distribution of the water in the lake and thus has inertia that smooths annual variability and generally better reflects long term trends in contrast fyw of n years depends only on changes in inflows and outflows during the last n years and is therefore more sensitive to large interannual variation resulting in a larger variability than the mean residence time the smaller the n of fyw the higher the variability hence considering both terms mean residence time and fywn is essential for obtaining an overall assessment of the state of water in lakes dividing the waterbodies to different parcels of water having different transport time is well established in many hydrological models e g mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 and ref therein some of them are very complex and interpreting their results may be difficult our developed approach may seem like a simplistic method which is based on a numer of assumptions such as assuming completely mixed conditions and disregarding stratification however as we use an annual time step we assume that stratification may occur during part of the year but complete mixing does prevail throughout the rest of the year furthermore the approach combines a number of time scale parameters average residence time age group distribution and fyw and it relies on past data of the entire examined period and therefore may provide a broad picture of the lake water exchange in addition the developted approach would not only allow to assess water residence time through water age distribution but it may also be adjusted and applyed for estimating nutrients residence time by calculating annual loads and corresponding dynamic annual budgets this informationis is expected to attract the attention of water managers e g in the context of eutrophication it should be noted that for lakes the fraction of young water is significant and provides an indication of lake water exchange which influences many natural physical and ecological processes hence indirectly expresses the lake water quality li et al 2010 in contrast in treated wastewater storage reservoirs which are a seasonal storage and hence the timescale is days unlike years in lakes the fraction of old water is much more important as it indicates longer time for natural treatment processes to occur which improve effluent quality in other words for treated wastewater storage reservoir a large fraction of old water is desirable juanico and friedler 1994 a similar approach of calculating both mean residence time and the fraction of young water was previously applied for treated wastewater storage reservoirs these variables were used as a design criteria and operation rules for treated wastewater storage reservoirs in eastern sicily italy consoli et al 2011 cirelli et al 2008 the authors indicated that the percentage of fresh effluents correlates with poor performance of the reactor and enables estimation of the removal of pollutants in non steady state systems in addition to forecasting the quality of the effluent released from the reservoir other studies at wastewater stabilization reservoirs identified the percentage of fresh effluents as the main parameter effecting effluent quality which was sensitive to operational changes friedler et al 2003 thus serve for optimization of wastewater stabilization reservoirs mancini et al 2017 the results describe the significance of both variables for design and operation of reservoirs however implementation of this approach for natural waterbodies as lake has not been performed yet analysis of the results of the 90 model simulations provides insight into the likely difference in mean residence time under the three projected futures they indicate that the predicted increase in mean residence time in 2060 under the bau scenario is expected to be 19 50 higher than the mean residence time calculated for 2018 following a unprecedent five year drought period in addition higher values of fyw10 in 2060 were obtained for the watershed and lake scenarios compared to bau scenario this means that the water in the lake will be much younger for these scenarios these results indicated that for the bau scenario with lower inflows and limited withdrawal water exchange in the lake will decrease as expected and as a consequence the water residence time in the lake will increase compared to the other scenarios since the forecast predicts long term decreases in inflows and outflows throughout the period at the end of the predicted period i e 2060 is expected to be mostly affected by these changes and therefore the highest mean residence time is expected then indeed the decrease in inflows and outflows throughout the period is well noticed in the predicted range of the mean residence time of bau scenario however importing water into the lake moderated the decline in inflows and therefore moderated the influence on the mean residence time as predicted for the watershed and lake scenarios these results strengthen the need for importing water into the lake in order to mitigate the reduction of natural inflows due to climate change in addition the obtained differences between watershed and lake scenarios indicate that according to our approach even when the differences in annual flows are quite small between the two scenarios the cumulative difference affect the water age distribution and the mean residence time and as a result may impact the lake ecosystem water time scale variables play a crucial role in waterbodies since they affect many natural biochemical and physical processes e g downstream output water exchange sedimentation degradation and nutrients exchange these significantly impact the water quality of the waterbodies hence the study of lakes and reservoirs time scale variables was found relevant for management purposes in numerous studies for example camacho and martin 2013 suggested to use time scales to support the development of minimum flow criteria along with the design of watershed management programs of st louis bay estuary mississippi qi et al 2016 quantified a time scale value for lake ecosystem management of lake poyang china using data of a series of scenarios based on inflows water levels and meteorological data for different representative periods these authors concluded that time scale indicators may provide environmental monitoring and could help to determine an appropriate management policy gao et al 2016 referred time scale values as a practical water management measure indicating persistence of pollution in the lake and signaling the need for an appropriate response by authorities to address lake water quality problems these examples emphasize the importance of accurate estimation of the water time scales which is a substantial task not only from the management point of view but also for basic research 5 conclusions we developed a novel approach for estimating the mean residence time of water within lake ecosystems under non steady state flow conditions this approach based on the water age distribution was adapted from the leslie matrix model major advantages associated with estimating the water mean residence time in lakes were demonstrated by our unique approach of calculating the water age distribution opposed to the traditional residence time calculation our water age distribution approach incorporates a memory component thereby providing a realistic solution better representing the aquatic ecosystem in question the water age distribution approach produces the fraction and volume distribution curves of all age classes within the lake for each simulated timestep thus in addition to mean residence time the fraction of young water fyw which quantifies the young fraction of water in the lake is analyzed mean residence time relies on the complete hydraulic age distribution hence it is less sensitive to changes in the annual inflows and outflows but succeedes in representing the underlying long term trends in contast the fywn relies on changes in inflows and outflows during the last n years and is much more sensitive to large interannual variation resulting in a larger variability than the mean residence time the developed approach was used for comparing three scenarios of importing water into lake kinneret assuming climate change in the lake region the approach indicated that even when the variation in flows is quite small the cumulative changes affect the water age distribution and thus the difference in mean residence time can be quite significant this observation would not have been obvious based on the traditional theoretical residence time calculation which relies on current conditions and ignores the lake s conditions at previous timesteps the current approach offers a more accurate estimation of water mean residence time in lakes and can easily be adapted to other water bodies such as reservoirs wetlands and estuaries it provides an overall picture of the water age structure expressed by fraction and volume of age classes simulation results of future scenarios may serve as basis for determining lakes management policy by controlling either inflows or outflows or both that will affect both the mean residence time and the fraction of young old water age classes declaration of competing interest the

israel national water company for providing the lake kinneret annual water balance information we also thank the planning division of the israel water authority for developing the thirty different long term time series which served as input to the model we developed and analyzed 
19924,water residence time which is affected by increasing water demands and climate change plays a crucial role in lakes and reservoirs since it influences many natural physical and ecological processes that eventually impact the water quality of the waterbody thus accurate quantification of the water residence time and its distribution is an important tool in lake management in this study we present a novel approach for assessing the residence time in lakes and reservoirs the approach is based on the leslie matrix model that was originally developed for the analysis of age structured biological population dynamics in this approach the water in the lake is divided into different age classes each representing the time since the parcel of water entered the lake and provides an overall picture of the water age structure the traditional approach for calculating residence times which relies only on the lake volume and annual inflow or outflow volumes thereby disregarding any previous information is very sensitive to large interannual variation while the proposed approach produces the fraction and volume distribution curves of all age classes within the lake for each simulated timestep thus in addition to mean residence time the fraction of young water fyw quantifying the young fraction of water in the lake can be analyzed the same is true for any other age class of water the approach was applied to lake kinneret sea of galilee historical data collected over 32 years 1987 2018 and for prediction of long term time series based on several future scenarios inflows and outflows it offers a more accurate quantification of the mean residence time of water in a lake and can easily be adapted to other waterbodies comparison of simulation results may serve as basis for determining the lake s management policy by controlling the inflows and outflows that will affect both the mean residence time and the fraction of young old age classes of water graphical

not have permission to share data 1 introduction increasing water demands from lakes and reservoirs in arid and semi arid regions due to population growth agricultural irrigation and economic activities in addition to changes in climate patterns result in significant fluctuations in the volume and depth of waterbodies these affect the physical hydrological and ecological processes in the aquatic ecosystem li et al 2010 climate change models for the mediterranean region predict a 25 30 decrease in precipitation and higher evaporation by the end of the twenty first century accompanied by even stronger reduction in annual runoff volumes in rural areas erol and randyr 2012 in addition occurrence of extreme events is expected to increase e g flooding extended droughts which will magnify the seasonal and multiannual water level fluctuations creating hydrological stresses such as prolonged hydraulic retention time in lakes jeppesen et al 2015 thus understanding lakes and reservoirs hydrodynamic processes and characteristics under varying water levels is essential for determination of optimal management policy however simple monitoring and flows and fluxes analyses may produce difficulties in gaining valuable information on the ecosystem s functioning deleersnijder et al 2001 therefore estimating a specific time scale analysis variable is often used such as water age and residence time both of which have been widely applied to numerous waterbodies e g qi et al 2016 viero and defina 2016 liu et al 2012 li et al 2010 monsen et al 2002 deleersnijder et al 2001 delhez et al 1999 etc water age and residence time are conducive variables used for estimating water mass exchange and can also be treated as effective factors for investigating patterns of water quality in lakes and reservoirs zimmerman 1976 defines residence time as the time it takes for any water parcel of the sample to leave the waterbody through its outlet and water age as the time it has spent since entering the waterbody through one of the boundaries water age is therefore defined by spatial heterogeneity particles at different locations within a water body will have different ages monsen et al 2002 water age and residence time naturally complement each other and while age traces water according to when it entered the domain of interest residence time follows the water until it leaves it delhez et al 2014 water time scale variables play a key parameter in limnology affecting biochemical processes nutrient concentrations and water quality in general for example more than 40 years ago vollenweider 1976 developed a regression relationship for average planktonic agal chlorophyll concentration as a function of the annual phosphorusload normalized by waterbody area mean depth and hydraulic residence time for a group of european waterbodies several studies have reported on a significant positive correlation between chlorophyll a concentration in the surface water layer and the time scale variables residence time or water age zou et al 2020 gao et al 2018 qi et al 2016 etc zhang et al 2010 demonstrated that an increase in time scale values yielded a decrease in dissolved organic matter and an increase in water salinity maavara et al 2018 who developed a mechanistic model to predict n2o emmission through nitrification and denitrification in various water bodies reported that a water residence time kinetically limits the extent of these processes in waterbodies other studies investigated the relationship between residence time and the availability of nutrients such as the significant impact of residence time on the total nitrogen change rates in waterbodies tong et al 2019 furthermore increase in cyanobacteria biomass was positively associated with retention time for various lake types such as humic and clear lakes richardson et al 2018 recently zhao et al 2022 who studied the effects of water residence time on nitrogen fixation reported that short lake water residence time can severely inhibit nitrogen fixation capacity by inhibiting the growth of nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria and hence may serve as management tool for controlling cyanobacteria growth and eutrophication development these publications demonstrated the effect of time scale variables on lake ecology and as consequence on lake water quality and may therefore provide a quantitative tool to support the management policy of lakes methods for estimating these time scale variables water age and residence time rely on in situ tracer studies or on different type of models for example kratzer and biagtan 1997 used dye tracer rhodamine and followed its movement downstream and indicated that the average tracer travel time at a downstream location was higher than the average tracer travel time at an upstream station in other words at each site the dye tracer arrived at different times resulting in longer or shorter travel times compared to average time other studies have used computerized tools mainly numerical hydrodynamic models for modeling time scales most of them three dimensional models that included fluid dynamics modules e g qi et al 2016 li et al 2010 zhang et al 2010 monsen et al 2002 deleersnijder et al 2001 delhez et al 1999 these tools are resource intensive and require preliminary preparation of the model settings in addition to its calibration and verification skilled users and sufficient computational resources in this study we present a novel approach for estimating the water age distribution and residence time in lakes the approach is based on the leslie matrix model that was originally developed for the analysis of age structured biological population dynamics leslie 1945 the approach has been modified and applied to non steady state reactors and treated wastewater storage reservoirs juanico and friedler 1994 and can provide information on the hydraulic age distribution of the lake or reservoir the leslie matrix model leslie 1945 is a deterministic model widely used to assess the age structure of populations e g iwasaki et al 2010 bergek et al 2012 and the references therein monte 2018 and the references therein sun et al 2021 briefly this model classifies individuals in a population into age classes population density is observed at regularly spaced times and is partitioned into several age classes the number of individuals in each age class is calculated at each timestep based on 1 survival rate the fraction of individuals in the current timestep that survive until the next timestep these advance from age class x to age class x 1 2 effective fertility the number of offspring born to an individual parent in age class x that survive until the next census 3 harvesting mechanism that specifies the harvesting policy of the population which can be defined independently for each age class e g how many trees from each age class the forestry industry can fell in a given tree stock these can be expressed by two matrices the leslie matrix representing the first two transformation laws and the harvesting matrix representing the harvesting policy following these steps the age structure of the population can be represented by a vector at any time water in lakes can be considered as a population divided into different age classes each representing the time since a conceptual parcel of water entered the lake this concept of dividing lake water to different parcels having different transport time has been addressed in the literature e g qi et al 2016 monsen et al 2002 zimmerman 1976 in this study we modified the leslie matrix model to represent the population dynamics as a water age structure within a non steady state flow lake ecosystem the water age distribution allows us to estimate the mean residence time of water in the lake and to analyze the water age structure at given times we applied the developed approach to the sub tropical lake kinneret sea of galilee with data collected over 32 years 1987 2018 and then used the method to evaluate the effect of long term future management scenarios on the age of the water in the lake 2 methodology 2 1 model description 2 1 1 the main concept when applying the leslie matrix model to a lake the water volume in the lake is divided into groups based on age classes where at each timestep the volume and the fraction of each age class is quantified in this case survival in the leslie matrix model represents water that remains in the lake i e the water that does not evaporate or flow out from the lake analogous to natural mortality in the modified model water which enters the lake at each timestep plays the role of fertility producing young water in the lake while water withdrawals are analogous to harvesting 2 1 2 description of the modified model in the leslie matrix model at each timestep the number of living individuals is quantified for each age class similarly the modified model estimates the water volume of each age class by using two indexes i 1 n which counts the number of timesteps and j 1 k which counts the number of age classes and the model estimates the water volume in each age class j during the time interval i in the original model in parallel to shifting forward in timesteps individuals that survive move from one age class to the next older age class getting older individuals that do not survive leave the class and are subtracted from the population in the modified model when shifting forward in timesteps a certain amount of water leaves the lake e g withdrawals evaporation river outflow etc and the water volume is reduced analogous to natural mortality and harvesting the remaining water the survivors progresses in the age classes and moves to the next class thereby getting older which in essence is equivalent to water residing for a longer time in the lake similar to the original leslie matrix model where offspring are added to the population as the youngest age class in the modified model inflows to the lake enter the youngest age class this is because inflows are the newest water added to the lake and are thus considered the youngest class at each timestep as an example if the model timestep is one year then the inflow is defined at the end of the interval as age class 1 which is one year old that is to say the water stays in the lake for one year assuming completely mixed conditions water outflow mortality and harvesting see above from each age class is proportional to its fractional volume completely mixed conditions can be assumed if the timestep is similar or longer than the lake mixing cycle i e for a monomictic lake such as lake kinneret berman et al 2014 the timestep should be at least one year it should be noted that we are fully aware of some possible short circuiting in the water flow i e water may enter and leave the epilimnion during the stratified period however accounting this will require a much more detailed and complex calculation and finer time steps with much richer data requirements such inflow water density density of the epilimnion etc the required input data for the modified model includes the initial lake volume vinitial scalar analogous to the total initial population and water flow data i e water entering offspring the lake during the determined timestep and leaving mortality and harvesting the lake during this timestep therefore if the timestep is one year the input data for inflows qi in i 1 n and outflows qi out i 1 n are annual flows 2 2 model development the age distribution of the water is constructed in steps assuming that the lake water is divided into k age classes if vi j volume of water in age class j at time i and fi j fractional volume of age class j at time i then eq 1 defines the relationship between the two where vi total is the total volume of the lake at time i eq 2 1 f i j v i j v i total 2 v i total j 1 k v i j combining eqs 1 and 2 yields the following expression 3 j 1 k f i j 1 if completely mixed conditions are assumed outflow water withdrawals natural stream outflows and evaporation from each age class is proportional to its fractional volume 4 q i j out q i out f i j where q i j out is the outflow volume that leaves age class j at the end of timestep i and qi out is the total outflow from the lake at time interval i inflows only enter the youngest age class in our case it is assumed the inflows enter the lake at the beginning of each time interval and part of it leaves the lake by the end of the time interval the volume of the lake at the end of each time interval is given by 5 v i total v i 1 total q i in q i out where v i 1 total is the total volume of the lake at time i 1 let the mid interval total lake volume v m e a n i total be defined as the arithmetic mean of the volume at the beginning and at the end of each time interval 6 v m e a n i total v i 1 total v i total 2 note v i 1 total is the total lake volume at the beginning of time interval i which is equal to the total volume at the end of time interval i 1 the age classes of water in the lake may be classified into the following two types 1 youngest age class j 1 which contains water that entered the lake at time interval i 2 age classes j 1 2 2 1 youngest age class j 1 since we assumed that inflows enter the youngest class j 1 at the beginning of each time interval and part of it leaves the lake by the end of the time interval the volume of this class is modified over the course of the time interval 7 v i 1 q i in q i 1 o u t combination of eqs 1 4 and 7 when using the mean lake volume yields an expression for the fractional volume of age class 1 at the end of time interval i 8 f i 1 q i in v mean i t o t a l q i o u t 2 2 2 age class j 1 the volume of the j th class by the end of time interval i can be expressed as 9 v i j v i 1 j 1 q i j o u t where v i 1 j 1 is the volume of age class j 1 at time interval i 1 note that moving from time interval i 1 to i age class j 1 gets older and becomes age class j now similar to 8 combination of 1 4 and 9 when using the mean lake volume yields an expression for the fractional volume of age class j 10 f i j v i 1 j 1 v mean i t o t a l q i o u t fig 1 illustrates the framework of the model water from age class 1 at timestep 1 which remained in the lake survived aged by one year and is present at timestep 2 in age class 2 it should be noted that the volume and fraction of this class are smaller than the volume at timestep 1 since some of the volume of the age class left the lake and the total lake volume has changed at the end of the simulation two matrixes are obtained one describes the volume of each age class and the other expresses the age classes fractional volumes for each timestep fig 1 each vertical vector column of these two matrixes represents a timestep while each horizontal vector row defines the age of the class namely if the simulation timestep is one year then each vertical vector is a different year where row 1 describes age class of year one row 2 represents age class of 2 years and so on the fraction matrix obtained can be used to calculate the mean residence time τi based on the age structure for each timestep each simulation year as follows 11 τ i 1 f 1 i 2 f 2 i k f k i j 1 k j f j i where f j i is the fraction of each age class j at timestep i and k is the maximum age class which contains the oldest water in the lake that is k years old or older for example assuming that three timesteps are modeled and the fractions of age class 1 2 and 3 are 0 3 0 6 and 0 1 respectively it should be noted that age class 3 contains the oldest water in the lake which entered the lake three years earlier and age class 1 contains the youngest water in the lake hence the average age of the water or the mean residence time is 1 8 years 0 3 1 0 6 2 0 1 3 2 3 study site lake kinneret sea of galilee is a meso eutrophic lake with mean annual primary production of 650 gc m 2 berman et al 1995 located at an elevation of about 210 m i e 210 m below mean sea level in the northern part of the dead sea rift valley part of the afro syrian rift series the lake is 22 km long and 12 km wide at maximum width when full the maximum and mean depths are 44 and 24 m respectively and its surface area is 170 km2 lake kinneret is a warm monomictic lake and due to its importance its inflows and outflows are continuously monitored by israel water authority iwa and by mekorot israel s national water company the lake receives inflows average of 600 mcm y million cubic meters per year during the years 1987 2018 from 6 main sources including the jordan river with an average of 390 mcm y and approximately 70 of the inflows gal et al 2003 direct rain with an average of 66 mcm y and direct runoff averaging 62 mcm y the lake outflow is composed of five sinks where the major ones are the national water carrier nwc with an average of 250 mcm y and evaporation with an average of 240 mcm y while only about 10 mcm y exits the lake through its natural outlet to the southern jordan river since the mid 1990s the lake ecosystem has undergone a number of significant limnological changes zohary 2004 gal and williamson 2010 zohary and ostrovsky 2011 including five consecutive drought years between the winter of 2013 14 to 2017 8 that exhibited extremely low inflows into the lake and as a result low outputs mainly low intake to the nwc and a declining water level tal 2019 lachmani 2019 2 4 model application 2 4 1 initial conditions and baseline simulation as lake kinneret is monomictic we assess the lake water age distribution residence time using a one year timestep the calculations are made for hydrological years which start on 1st october and ends on 30th september the following year data used in this study were collected as part of the on going lake kinneret monitoring program sukenik et al 2014 and included annual inflow and outflow data for 32 years over from 1987 through 2018 a lake water volume of 3 755 mcm estimated for october 1 1987 served as the initial volume at the beginning of the simulation the structure of the water age classes in the lake is not known hence all water receives an age of one year during the simulation of the first years age classes are constructed during each timestep the age class structure is not stable and contains only a limited number of age classes therefore the model requires a spin up period this was achieved by repeated simulation of the year 1987 for 100 times at equilibrium conditions inflow outflow so the lake volume on october 1st did not change between years the structure of the water age classes in the lake obtained after 100 timesteps was used as an initial condition for the simulation and then calculated for each year over a period of 32 years 1987 2018 2 4 2 future scenarios israel water authority iwa the body that manages the lake developed a strategic plan for protecting the lake ecosystem in coming decades 2018 2050 in order to cope with extended drought periods iwa 2018 tal 2019 the strategic plan followed an unprecedented five year drought in northern israel which resulted in decreasing flows in the streams feeding the lake to the lowest ever recorded lachmani et al 2019 and a lake level closest to the lowest ever recorded under the assumption that climate change will continue gal et al 2020 and intensify in the lake region tal 2019 the strategic plan includes importing excess desalinated water from the national water supply system into the lake to evaluate the potential impact of climate change on inflows into the lake and water demand from the lake thirty different long term time series predicting the inflow and outflows entering and leaving the lake for the years 2020 2050 were developed by iwa based on rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 iwa israel water authority 2018a the long term time series realizations referred to the predicted regional water demand in addition to climate change effects expressed by elevated air temperature reduced precipitation and lower inflows to and outflows from the lake while all realizations had the same characteristics they were shifted by one year resulting in a displacement in the timing of peaks and minima in addition there was an annual inflow decrease of 10 mcm y over the course of the simulation period the average predicted overall inflows and outflows for 2020 2060 were 515 mcm y for both inflow and outflow which is approximetly 100 mcm y less in comparison to 2000s the strategic plan prescribed that an additional annual volume of imported water that will be added to the lake during a certain year will be utilized during the same year importing water to the lake will be executed gradually starting with an addition of about 10 mcm y in 2023 and reaching its maximum in 2050 this was planned under two possible scenarios table 1 that included 1 importing the excess water directly into the lake lake scenario reaching a maximum 304 mcm y in 2050 and averaging 184 mcm y over the entire period 2030 2050 and 2 adding part of the imported water directly into the lake and part to streams in the upper part of the lake s watershed watershed scenario a portion of which will drain through the natural drainage system into the lake in this case water addition to the lake will reach a maximum 245 mcm y by 2050 and average 129 mcm y over the whole period the two scenarios as well as business as usual bau scenario in which no water is imported into the lake from external sources were compared by assessing the age distribution of the water within the lake over the period of the realizations thirty long term time series forecasting inflow and outflow to the lake during the years 2020 2050 were established by iwa for each scenario the long term time series forecasting were extended to year 2060 in order to study a longer period and to analyze the effect of water import at the end of the period these data served as input for the three scenarios creating a total of 90 model simulations 2 5 model output analysis the developed model was initially applied to data collected from lake kinneret during the years 1987 2018 than it was used for analyzing future scenarios we then will focus on two very different years including a high 2013 and low inflow year 2018 while 2013 was a rainy year that experienced large inflows into the lake 776 mcm y lachmani et al 2019 2018 was a dry year following 5 consecutive drought years 2014 2018 with inflows between 312 390 mcm y lachmani et al 2019 3 results 3 1 model implementation for the years 1987 2018 3 1 1 analysis of the age structure in the lake 1987 2018 the age structure obtained by the water age distribution approach shows as expected that for each examined year some of the water had resided in the lake for a long time while some was younger the fraction of young water fyw is a quantification of the young fraction of water in the lake modified from juanico and friedler 1994 for example fyw10 is the fractional volume of water that has resided 1 10 years in the lake expressed as a proportion of total lake volume fig 2 a analysis of fyws for varying ages highlights the differences in response to dry and wet years as expected when inflows were higher the fyws increased and vice versa during dry years fig 2b during the 1992 hydrological year for example inflows and outflows were very high 1 526 and 980 mcm y respectively resulting in fyw2 36 and fyw15 100 i e practically all water in the lake was younger than 15 years on the other hand in 2001 inflows and outflows were much lower with values of 558 mcm y and 468 mcm y representing approximetly 30 and 50 of the outflows in 1992 respectively as a consequence in 2001 only 15 of the water was 2 years old i e 85 older than 2 years old and as little as 18 of the water was older than 15 years 3 1 2 mean residence time 1987 2018 for each simulated period the mean residence time was calculated based on the age structure approach eq 11 the mean residence time of the water in the lake increased by 24 over the period 1987 2018 from 6 6 years in 1987 to 8 6 years in 2018 fig 3 with linear slope of 0 05 y 1 r2 0 67 p 0 005 over the course of this period inflows to and outflows from the lake significantly changed and affected the mean residence time which increased and decreased inversely to the flows for example in 1992 the inflow and the outflow were very high therefore the mean residence time was low 6 8 years on the other hand during the dry 2001 the mean residence time was higher 7 3 years from 2013 onwards the mean residence time steadily increased as a result of five consecutive dry years due to low inflows and as a result minimal water extraction as a consequence the linear increase in mean residence time calculated for the 2013 2018 drought period was 0 3 y 1 r2 0 98 p 0 005 calculation of the traditional residence time lake volume divided by the total inflow or outflow wetzel 2001 for the simulated years inversely followed the inflows and yielded a much more notable variation between the simulated years compared to mean residence time calculated according to the age distribution approach the increase in residence time during the 1987 2018 period based on the traditional calculation was from 4 2 1987 to 10 9 y 2018 or from 6 2 1987 to 9 5 y 2018 depending if inflows or outflows were used respectively in these cases the change represents at least a 259 and 152 increase in residence time over that period based on inflows and outflows respectively 3 1 3 2013 and 2018 the high inflows of the year 2013 entered age class 1 and after subtracting the relative outflows leaving the class during the time interval age class 1 constituted about 15 of the total volume of water in the lake fig 4 a for 2013 age class 1 is the largest one followed by an almost exponential reduction of the water volumes of the following age classes in the case of steady inflows and outflows an exponential trend is expected since during every timestep of the simulation the volumes of the age classes decrease due to outflows therefore an older class would become smaller and smaller for more details see juanico and friedler 1994 on the other hand in 2018 the age class volumes distribution was not as orderly as in 2013 as it followed five consecutive drought years 2014 2018 with low inflows into the lake these low inflows are well noticed fig 4b and are expressed in age classes 1 5 2018 to 2014 respectively especially in relation to the relative fraction of the same age classes in 2013 fig 4a the high inflow of 2013 is clearly pronounced as age class 6 in 2018 though by 2018 the class 6 containing the 2013 inflows was smaller than when it first entered the lake a total decline of 249 mcm it was nevertheless the largest class representing 10 of the volume of water in the lake as opposed to only 7 of age class 1 2018 inflows 3 2 model prediction for the years 2020 2060 as aforementioned section 2 4 above the water age distribution approach developed in this study was applied to proposed water importing scenarios developed by the iwa using 30 long term time series forecasting of inflow and outflow to and from the lake during the projection period an example for the input and output of one time series is shown in fig 5 for all three scenarios the results show that the bau scenario is substantially different than the two other scenarios starting from 2030 inflows and outflows are typically much lower than the ones projected for the two water import scenarios with an average difference of about 100 mcm y consequently a higher mean residence time is predicted for the bau scenario for the bau scenario the water exchange is low and the mean residence time considerably increases with time reaching 12 6 y in 2060 compared to 8 0 y in 2000 moreover the gap between its value and the mean residence time for the two other scenarios increases over time the maximum difference between the mean residence time predicted for the bau and the lake and watershed scenarios in 2060 was 3 4 and 2 7 y respectively the difference between the lake and watrershed scenarios is less pronounced but consistently increases over time from no difference in 2030 to a difference of 0 25 y 3 difference in 2040 and a maximum difference of 0 8 y 10 difference in 2060 for each water import scenario bau lake watershed the model was executed over 30 time series and thus predicted 30 solutions for each simulated year creating three ranges of possible results one for each scenario fig 6 a the increase in the mean residence time over the simulated period for the bau scenario is obvious in all 30 predicted time series rangingfrom 8 0 8 3 y in 2020 to 10 3 13 0 y in 2060 the end of the forecast period as water is planned to be imported starting from 2030 the mean residence times of all three scenarios overlap until 2031 and then deviate from each other the maximum difference in mean residence times between the examined scenarios occurred at the end of the predicted period 2060 with 5 and 4 year differences between bau and lake and bau and watershed scenarios respectively these gaps over the period 2032 2060 were found to be statistically significant ancova p 0 05 the fyw10 in 2020 for all three alternatives ranged between 67 to 86 meaning that about 13 34 of the water resided in the lake longer than 10 years fig 6b since the forecast predicts a long term decrease in inflows and outflows throughout the period the obtained fwy10 also decreased signifying a larger volume of water residing in the lake longer than 10 years for example the fyw10 in 2040 ranged between 54 to 70 for the bau scenario and being higher for the other two scenarios with 63 76 and 65 79 for watershed and lake scenarios respectively in 2060 the fyw10 decreased by 5 6 for the bau alternative while a more moderate reduction was obtained for the watershed 3 4 and lake up to 3 scenarios compared to 2040 analysis of the solutions for the lake and watershed scenarios indicated similarity in the mean residence times from 2020 to 2038 from 2039 a statistically significant difference is observed between the mean residence times of these two scenarios ancova p 0 05 despite the relatively small differences in annual inflows in the two scenarios average difference of about 40 mcm y the cumulative impact of the differences over time results is a statistically significant difference of up to 2 y in the mean residence time in 2060 25 difference 4 discussion the novel approach presented here for estimating the lake mean residence time accounts for the relative annual contribution of all inputs and outputs of water into a lake the results show that flows changed significantly over the simulated period while changes to the mean residence time were much less pronounced and as expected its value slightly increased during dry years with low flows and vice versa the traditional residence time calculated by the ration of lake volume to total inflow or outflow is a well known method in limnology wetzel 2001 it is however a simplification of the complex calculation of the real residence time since it re calculates the residence time each year without considering previous years i e the calculation does not account for the residence time at the beginning of the year thus it can be suitable only for lakes and reservoirs operating under steady or quasi steady state where inflows and outflows do not differ significantly from one year to another so with the traditional calculation an extremely dry year would provide an estimated very long residence time for a lake though the previous years may have been extremely wet with very high inflows in contrast the developed mean residence time calculation includes a memory component as it depends on past data of the examined period and therefore provides a more realistic and accurate solution for example calculating the traditional residence time based on inflow for the consecutive years 1991 and 1992 yielded 9 y and 3 y respectively fig 2 a gap of 6 years caused by the high inflows during 1992 that had inflows and outflows of 1 526 and 980 mcm y respectively compared to 1991 which had inflows and outflows of 430 mcm y the traditional theoretical residence time in 1992 does not consider the effect of the preceding three year drought and relies only on the high inflow during 1992 and therefore it dramatically decreases in 1992 on the other hand the water age distribution approach which accounts for conditions through previous years yielded quite similar values of 7 6 and 7 7 y for 1991 and 1992 respectively the water age distribution approach yielded the definition of the fraction of young water fyw where fyws increased with increasing flows and vice versa decreased during dry years the significant change in inflows during 1991 1992 is well noticed in the calculated fyws fig 2 therefore for a better understanding of the overall picture both parameters should be analyzed mean residence time and fyws our approach provides an overall picture of the water age classes distribution obtained for each year of the simulation as was illustrated for 2013 and 2018 fig 4 these data allowed us to compare between years and to draw conclusions regarding age classes and the residence time of the water in the lake for example in 2013 50 of the water resided in the lake five years or less obtained by summing the fraction of age classes 1 5 in contrast in 2018 only 28 of the water resided in the lake 5 years or less while 72 had been in the lake longer than 5 years namely the water in the lake was much younger during 2013 compared to 2018 when inflows and outflows are low the water mass exchange is poor and the water resides in the lake much longer than during years with high inflows and outflows when higher water mass exchange generates a high proportion of younger water age classes fig 2b the mean residence time calculated by the new approach for 1987 2018 was less sensitive to fluctuations in the annual inflows and outflows than the fyw this is due to the fact that the mean residence time depends on the complete hydraulic age distribution of the water in the lake and thus has inertia that smooths annual variability and generally better reflects long term trends in contrast fyw of n years depends only on changes in inflows and outflows during the last n years and is therefore more sensitive to large interannual variation resulting in a larger variability than the mean residence time the smaller the n of fyw the higher the variability hence considering both terms mean residence time and fywn is essential for obtaining an overall assessment of the state of water in lakes dividing the waterbodies to different parcels of water having different transport time is well established in many hydrological models e g mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 and ref therein some of them are very complex and interpreting their results may be difficult our developed approach may seem like a simplistic method which is based on a numer of assumptions such as assuming completely mixed conditions and disregarding stratification however as we use an annual time step we assume that stratification may occur during part of the year but complete mixing does prevail throughout the rest of the year furthermore the approach combines a number of time scale parameters average residence time age group distribution and fyw and it relies on past data of the entire examined period and therefore may provide a broad picture of the lake water exchange in addition the developted approach would not only allow to assess water residence time through water age distribution but it may also be adjusted and applyed for estimating nutrients residence time by calculating annual loads and corresponding dynamic annual budgets this informationis is expected to attract the attention of water managers e g in the context of eutrophication it should be noted that for lakes the fraction of young water is significant and provides an indication of lake water exchange which influences many natural physical and ecological processes hence indirectly expresses the lake water quality li et al 2010 in contrast in treated wastewater storage reservoirs which are a seasonal storage and hence the timescale is days unlike years in lakes the fraction of old water is much more important as it indicates longer time for natural treatment processes to occur which improve effluent quality in other words for treated wastewater storage reservoir a large fraction of old water is desirable juanico and friedler 1994 a similar approach of calculating both mean residence time and the fraction of young water was previously applied for treated wastewater storage reservoirs these variables were used as a design criteria and operation rules for treated wastewater storage reservoirs in eastern sicily italy consoli et al 2011 cirelli et al 2008 the authors indicated that the percentage of fresh effluents correlates with poor performance of the reactor and enables estimation of the removal of pollutants in non steady state systems in addition to forecasting the quality of the effluent released from the reservoir other studies at wastewater stabilization reservoirs identified the percentage of fresh effluents as the main parameter effecting effluent quality which was sensitive to operational changes friedler et al 2003 thus serve for optimization of wastewater stabilization reservoirs mancini et al 2017 the results describe the significance of both variables for design and operation of reservoirs however implementation of this approach for natural waterbodies as lake has not been performed yet analysis of the results of the 90 model simulations provides insight into the likely difference in mean residence time under the three projected futures they indicate that the predicted increase in mean residence time in 2060 under the bau scenario is expected to be 19 50 higher than the mean residence time calculated for 2018 following a unprecedent five year drought period in addition higher values of fyw10 in 2060 were obtained for the watershed and lake scenarios compared to bau scenario this means that the water in the lake will be much younger for these scenarios these results indicated that for the bau scenario with lower inflows and limited withdrawal water exchange in the lake will decrease as expected and as a consequence the water residence time in the lake will increase compared to the other scenarios since the forecast predicts long term decreases in inflows and outflows throughout the period at the end of the predicted period i e 2060 is expected to be mostly affected by these changes and therefore the highest mean residence time is expected then indeed the decrease in inflows and outflows throughout the period is well noticed in the predicted range of the mean residence time of bau scenario however importing water into the lake moderated the decline in inflows and therefore moderated the influence on the mean residence time as predicted for the watershed and lake scenarios these results strengthen the need for importing water into the lake in order to mitigate the reduction of natural inflows due to climate change in addition the obtained differences between watershed and lake scenarios indicate that according to our approach even when the differences in annual flows are quite small between the two scenarios the cumulative difference affect the water age distribution and the mean residence time and as a result may impact the lake ecosystem water time scale variables play a crucial role in waterbodies since they affect many natural biochemical and physical processes e g downstream output water exchange sedimentation degradation and nutrients exchange these significantly impact the water quality of the waterbodies hence the study of lakes and reservoirs time scale variables was found relevant for management purposes in numerous studies for example camacho and martin 2013 suggested to use time scales to support the development of minimum flow criteria along with the design of watershed management programs of st louis bay estuary mississippi qi et al 2016 quantified a time scale value for lake ecosystem management of lake poyang china using data of a series of scenarios based on inflows water levels and meteorological data for different representative periods these authors concluded that time scale indicators may provide environmental monitoring and could help to determine an appropriate management policy gao et al 2016 referred time scale values as a practical water management measure indicating persistence of pollution in the lake and signaling the need for an appropriate response by authorities to address lake water quality problems these examples emphasize the importance of accurate estimation of the water time scales which is a substantial task not only from the management point of view but also for basic research 5 conclusions we developed a novel approach for estimating the mean residence time of water within lake ecosystems under non steady state flow conditions this approach based on the water age distribution was adapted from the leslie matrix model major advantages associated with estimating the water mean residence time in lakes were demonstrated by our unique approach of calculating the water age distribution opposed to the traditional residence time calculation our water age distribution approach incorporates a memory component thereby providing a realistic solution better representing the aquatic ecosystem in question the water age distribution approach produces the fraction and volume distribution curves of all age classes within the lake for each simulated timestep thus in addition to mean residence time the fraction of young water fyw which quantifies the young fraction of water in the lake is analyzed mean residence time relies on the complete hydraulic age distribution hence it is less sensitive to changes in the annual inflows and outflows but succeedes in representing the underlying long term trends in contast the fywn relies on changes in inflows and outflows during the last n years and is much more sensitive to large interannual variation resulting in a larger variability than the mean residence time the developed approach was used for comparing three scenarios of importing water into lake kinneret assuming climate change in the lake region the approach indicated that even when the variation in flows is quite small the cumulative changes affect the water age distribution and thus the difference in mean residence time can be quite significant this observation would not have been obvious based on the traditional theoretical residence time calculation which relies on current conditions and ignores the lake s conditions at previous timesteps the current approach offers a more accurate estimation of water mean residence time in lakes and can easily be adapted to other water bodies such as reservoirs wetlands and estuaries it provides an overall picture of the water age structure expressed by fraction and volume of age classes simulation results of future scenarios may serve as basis for determining lakes management policy by controlling either inflows or outflows or both that will affect both the mean residence time and the fraction of young old water age classes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments we thank mekorot israel national water company for providing the lake kinneret annual water balance information we also thank the planning division of the israel water authority for developing the thirty different long term time series which served as input to the model we developed and analyzed
