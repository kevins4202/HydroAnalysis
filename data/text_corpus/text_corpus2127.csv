10635,understanding water productivity wp on a regional scale is useful for identifying and managing inefficiencies in irrigated crop production systems however relevant wp analyses are not available for maize production systems in china a meta analysis was conducted of maize wp in northern china that included 2354 observations from 282 articles published between january 2000 and march 2018 our goal was to quantify the current wp and its constraining factors and estimate the boundary function for wp in the different maize agro ecological zones of northern china the northern china average wp across the large set of field experiments was 22 3 kg ha 1 mm 1 with northeast china ne 25 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 north china plain ncp 22 3 kg ha 1 mm 1 northwest china nw 21 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 the boundary

average temperature experimental regions and years wp was increased by optimal irrigation soil surface with plastic mulch deep tillage straw incorporation into the soil ridge planting and the application of super absorbent polymer in this study we provided both reference wp values recommendations to achieve higher wp and identification of regions with opportunities for improvement keywords

varies widely dependent on multiple factors such as climate conditions sun et al 2013 soil properties katerji and mastrorilli 2009 and management practices hatfield et al 2001 in practice wp is synergistically affected by crop yield and seasonal water supply and high wp indicates higher crop production from the same water supply or the same crop production from low water supply zwart and

2004 zhang et al 2014 such analyses are lacking for major maize producing zones in china maize in china accounts for more than one third of the country s cereal production and 18 of global maize output fao 2017 maize production has increased rapidly when compared with the relatively stable rice and wheat production in china and is planted across several agro ecological zones spanning from cold to subtropical from arid to humid and from single to double cropping production systems tao and zhang 2011 the variation in chinese maize production and the crisis of limited water resources provide a need to quantify wp under different climate soil and management practices to determine the impact of factors and improve water management for maize production many field measurements have indicated that agricultural practices that reduce soil surface evaporation e g soil surface plastic mulch reduced tillage and surface residue qin et al 2015 wang et al 2015 2018a 2018b improved

high wp besides some other measures like super absorbent polymers polymer also may improve maize wp by increasing soil water storage liu et al 2007 however there is great variation in the magnitude of the increase in wp with improved management practices under different environmental conditions it would be useful to provide practical guidance for maximizing production with the least amount of water for chinese maize production the boundary function for wp can be determined by the highest attained yield for a given seasonal water supply kg grain produced per ha per mm water supply grassini et al 2009 2011 rattalino edreira et al 2018 previous evaluations have been demonstrated and quantified the boundary function for wp as benchmarks for chinese maize production zhang et al 2014 lin and liu 2016 however differences in boundary function methods and datasets have resulted in inconsistent conclusions for example attainable water productivity was estimated at 40 kg ha 1 mm 1 based on french and schultz s boundary function across 36 studies of maize experiments between 1996 and 2012 zhang et al 2014 the potential wp was also calculated as 60 kg ha 1 mm 1 across 65 articles published between 1987 and 2014 based on the quantile regression theory lin and liu 2016 an integrated assessment of the boundary function for wp at the regional levels for china is therefore needed to establish realistic goals of agricultural production considering available water resources and to determine the related factors that constrain wp in china the irrigated maize area accounted for 46 of cropped area in 2008 fao 2018 irrigation water need is projected to increase due to increased drought affected area due to climate change piao et al 2010 wu et al 2010 we conducted a meta analysis of maize yield and water use data presented in peer reviewed studies in northern china 2354 observations from 282 studies to 1 investigate the current state of irrigated maize wp and influencing factors 2 evaluate management practices to improve wp and 3 estimate the boundary function for wp within different maize production regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 research area the research regions are divided into three agro ecological zones northwest china nw 34 40 n 95 115 e northeast china ne 40 55 n 110 135 e and north china plain ncp 32 41 n 113 120 e wu et al 2013 these three zones accounted for 88 maize planted area and 90 of production in 2011 2016 china agriculture database 2017 the ne agro ecological zone experiences a cold humid or semi humid temperate climate with a mean precipitation of 530 mm 60 of which falls from july to september the ncp has a warm semi humid continental monsoon climate with extremely variable annual precipitation ranging from 500 to 700 mm about 70 80 of which falls in summer in most of the nw agro ecological zone has high elevation with annual precipitation is below 375 mm china meteorological administration 1980 2010 2 2 data collection we conducted a review of peer reviewed scientific journal articles on water productivity in maize production published from january 2000 to march 2018 using the china national knowledge infrastructure and web of science databases the different combinations of search terms included irrigation and maize or corn and yield and water use efficiency or water productivity and china were used for article selection all data were obtained directly from tables or indirectly from graphs using getdata graph digitizer shcherbak et al 2014 we complied with the following screening criteria to ensure accuracy in these analyses all data were from field experiments so laboratory experiments pot experiments experiments under rain proof shelter conditions and model simulations were excluded and data were required to include maize yield seasonal water supply and wp in the maize growth period the reported water supply values were collected to estimate wp the water supply was calculated as the sum of in season precipitation plus irrigation plus change in soil water content between sowing and harvest for at least a 1 m soil layer wp is calculated as the amount of grain produced per unit of water supply the exact locations of experimental sites were required for our analysis only experiments that reported replication of each treatment were considered and all data were treatment average across all replications sites with water tables 5 m deep were removed from the database only irrigated maize production was considered the grain yields were measured by manual harvesting and were adjusted to 14 moisture some outlier yield et and wp values were excluded from the database and the outliers were determined as records exceeding 1 5 interquartile range below the 25th percentile or above the 75th percentile kranarz et al 2009 hubert and veeken 2008 in total we included data from 2354 records found in 282 articles the data used in the meta analysis were distributed over 442 different site years in china nw n 1150 ne n 207 ncp n 996 across the database 64 of the records indicated that capillary rise from groundwater could be ignored due to the deep water tables the following data in the 442 site years were compiled from the selected publications experimental location longitude latitude experimental years experimental sites experimental treatments maize yield seasonal water supply wp and other relevant parameters to wp including seasonal precipitation amounts sp irrigation depths soil organic matter som n application amount plant density and maize cultivars seasonal average temperature st and vapor pressure deficit vpd data were derived from the agrometeorological experimental stations nearby the experimental field see supplementary dataset 2 3 data analyses 2 3 1 analyses of environmental factors water productivity wp and yield we used a linear mixed effects model with yield ln transformed water supply ln transformed and wp ln transformed as response variables

irrigation depth continuous ln transformed vpd continuous ln transformed seasonal n application amount continuous ln transformed som continuous ln transformed latitude continuous ln transformed and plant density continuous ln transformed at the study locations as independent variables we included interaction terms for some factors sp irrigation depth in the model finally we included a random intercept term for the experimental sites of studies data from previous studies i e chinese provinces prior to the analysis we standardized continuous variables using logarithmic transformations and we referenced previous studies using the rescale functions in the arm package of r software www r project org to standardize categorical variables we used the function lmer in the lme4 package of r software to fit the mixed effects model ndac et al 2018 after fitting the model we used the function dredge in the r software mumin package bartoń 2016 to perform model selection the models were ranked by their akaike s information criteria with corrections for small sample sizes aicc we followed the procedures of burnham et al 2011 to perform model averaging we extracted the coefficient for each moderator from this confidence set as the weighted average of each coefficient across models containing that moderator using the aicc to weight wi each model ndac et al 2018 because we standardized inputs for the moderators the model averaged coefficients had comparable scales and we therefore chose not to back transform the moderators to their original scales 2 3 2 analyses of management practices to identify effective crop management practices for improving maize wp and yield we pooled studies that included side by side comparisons of different crop management practices i e the treatment was the same as the control in all aspects except for the each crop management practice and calculated effect sizes for pairwise comparisons optimal irrigation vs farmer irrigation plastic mulch vs no mulch straw re incorporation vs no straw re incorporation deep tillage deep ripping vs rotary tillage no tillage vs rotary tillage ridge planting vs flat planting and polymer application vs no polymer application the farmers irrigation was specifically specified in the published paper or it was clearly explained the irrigation technology followed the local farmers methods drip irrigation and sprinkling irrigation were assigned to the optimal irrigation category the contrasting procedures were traditional irrigation the ridge planting is a catchment agriculture technology that involves building ridges and furrows in the field with crops planted in the ridge or furrows other paired management practices were also categorized based on previous peer reviewed reports the effects of different management measures on different variables x were assessed in the form of natural log of the response ratio rrs hedges et al 1999 and the detailed method referenced by zheng et al 2019 the results were estimated by r 1 100 under treatment effects huang et al 2015 xia et al 2017 if the 95 confidence intervals cis did not superimpose on zero the differences were considered significant a positive or negative value indicated an increase or decreased in the response variable under different management practices respectively prior to the analysis we checked the data assumptions of the procedures using the residuals of the fitted model kozak and piepho 2017 2 3 3 current wp and boundary function the boundary functions for wp was determined by quantile regression for the relationship between maize yield and seasonal water supply using ibm spss statistics 19 0 lin and liu 2016 grassini et al 2015 first we followed the classification concept of quantile regression and ranked yield data points based on water supply then the 95th percentile of yield data points using 20 mm class intervals were selected as the upper boundary lin and liu 2017 and finally were used to fit the boundary line the slope line of the fitted boundary function indicates the highest yield at a given seasonal water supply level it means the highest attainable wp potential the fitted boundary function was y wpp water supply x because yield does not always increase with seasonal water supply the boundary function follows a linear plateau model sadras and angus 2006 before reaching the plateau with the function was y plateau value the 95th percentile of yield as the yield plateau 3 results 3 1 current wp and boundary function the maize grain yield from 282 published articles covering 442 site years averaged 9 81 mg ha 1 fig 1 and the wp averaged 22 3 kg ha 1 mm 1 and ranged from 6 to 45 kg ha 1 mm 1 fig 1 the mean wp followed the order ne mean 25 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 95 cis 25 6 26 9 kg ha 1 mm 1 range 15 38 kg ha 1 mm 1 ncp mean 22 3 kg ha 1 mm 1 95 cis 21 7 22 5 kg ha 1 mm 1 range 6 42 kg ha 1 mm 1 nw mean 21 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 95 cis 21 2 22 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 range 7 45 kg ha 1 mm 1 fig 1 the highest wp in ne was attributed to relatively higher average yield 11 11 mg ha 1 although the grain yield of nw was also relatively high 10 71 mg ha 1 the wp was relatively low due to its relatively higher water supply mean 519 mm fig 1 we established the wp boundary function with relationship between maize yield and water supply across different agro ecological zones the boundary function for wp had slopes of 42 5 36 8 and 40 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 for nw ncp and ne respectively fig 2 this wp function proved to be a robust benchmark when compared with actual yield and water supply data and indicated a large potential for improvement of maize wp 3 2 factors and management practices influencing wp yield and et model averaged parameter estimates indicated that the standardized effect size which is defined as the effect value after standardization of the independent variable for latitude was 3 489 95 cis 4 55 to 2 427 vpd 0 405 0 562 to 0 247 n rate 0 043 0 027 to 0 06 st 1 236 0 777 1 694 the agro ecological zones 0 452 0 281 to 0 623 and the experimental year 0 026 0 020 to 0 032 these had larger effects on wp than other moderators fig 3 supplementary table 3 these four moderators had the lowest aicc values for wp according to the model selection analysis table 1 and were included in the model wp was also correlated though but not significantly with plant density maize varieties and som the responses of yield and water supply on the same moderators were not the same as wp fig 3 table 1 for example sp increased both maize yield and water supply but did not significantly affect wp similarly plant density was positively related with both yield and water supply and had no effect on wp the st increased maize yield thus improved wp but there was no significant relationship between water supply and st fig 3 supplementary table 2 the wp yield and water supply were moderately correlated with management practices fig 4 both wp and yield were increased significantly by 6 59 and 18 12 with optimal irrigation compared with traditional irrigation management polymer and ridge planting increased wp due to decreased seasonal water supply both plastic mulch and straw re incorporation significantly improved wp by 17 28 and 12 64 respectively due to markedly increasing yield and reducing water supply the deep tillage deep ripping factor had a significant effect on wp which was attributed to a large significant increase in yield 4 discussion 4 1 wp comparisons between our study and previous estimates the estimated wp between 2000 and 2018 in the northern china was 22 kg ha 1 mm 1 which is substantially higher than that determined in previous research on irrigated maize in china 17 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 deng et al 2006 in this study the wp of maize production was estimated based on data from experimental plots in general experimental plots were managed carefully under optimal conditions e g nutrient supply pest management tillage and irrigation technology which together increased the wp furthermore the introductions of new cultivars and improved management practices in recent years have improved both yield and wp zhang et al 2011a 2011b most data used in the study by deng et al 2006 were collected before 2000 whereas we used data collected after 2000 this difference in timing likely contributed to the disparity in wp estimates our estimated wp was higher than 18 kg ha 1 mm 1 of global average zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 and 19 7 kg ha 1 mm 1 of the western american maize belt average grassini et al 2011 the higher wp in china is partly explained by some field management measures such as plastic mulch and deep tillage deep ripping similar results were reported that the plastic mulch increased wp by 22 9 relative no mulching dong et al 2018 less irrigation water and low rainfall in the northern china also contributed to high wp for maize production 4 2 wp responses to environmental factors and management measures we calculated a broad range of wp values in northern china range 6 45 kg ha 1 mm 1 fig 1 and indicated a large potential for wp improvement the variations in wp between and within zones were caused by multiple factors in our study the latitude was the largest contribution to wp followed by st regions vpd som years n application plant density and variety similar research reported that the wp was correlated with latitude zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 hatfield et al 1999 reduced n application deceased yield hatfield et al 2001 ogola et al 2002 thus wp responded positively to n rate as reported in previous studies hatfield et al 2001 major increases in both wp and yield over time have been attributed to the introduction of new cultivars and optimal management practices that have increased maize yield or and lowered water supply zhang et al 2011a 2011b lu et al 2016 previous studies also reported that vpd significantly affect wp rattalino edreira et al 2018 across all management procedures fig 4 wp was positively correlated with optimal irrigation polymer plastic mulch straw re incorporation deep tillage and ridge planting for example sprinkler and drip irrigation could reduce the amount of water leached from the root zone thus increasing the water available for et and plant growth romero et al 2006 el hendawy and mohamed 2008 polymer increases water storage capacity and prevents loss of water from the rhizosphere thereby decreasing the negative effects of water stress mahalleh et al 2011 fallahi et al 2015 plastic mulch had a significant effect on maize wp because it could reduce soil evaporation and increase early season soil temperature which accelerates germination and increases yield in temperate climates zhou et al 2009 thereby significantly increasing yield and wp straw re incorporation increased both soil quality and soil water holding capacity thus improving wp fan et al 2005 wang et al 2018a 2018b ridge planting contributed to increased soil temperature which significantly increased wp he et al 2010 the ridge area was never compacted and was left undisturbed except during planting and tillage operations producing a zone with soil conditions conductive to higher soil moisture and crop yields kaspar et al 1995 relative to shallow rotary tillage deep cultivation may have alleviated the restriction imposed on root depth and root density and promoted the absorption of water and nutrients by roots bennie and botha 1986 and thus increased maize yield and wp there was no significant overall effect of no tillage on maize yield and wp which disagreed with a meta analysis by wang et al 2018a 2018b other research has indicated the effects of no tillage on wp and yield depend on climate soil properties no till duration and irrigation patterns rainfed or irrigated pittelkow et al 2015 wang et al 2018a 2018b in this study the wp boundary function had slopes of 42 5 36 8 and 40 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 in nw ncp and ne respectively previous studies reported that these values were 47 5 kg ha 1 mm 1 and even 60 5 kg ha 1 mm 1 under plastic mulch in china lin and liu 2016 the wp boundary function was reported as 49 kg ha 1 mm 1 for global maize production bastiaanssen and steduto 2017 and 37 kg ha 1 mm 1 in the us maize belt grassini et al 2009 overall our studies indicated that a large wp potential should be achievable in the future some on farm experiments indicated that the wp boundary function of chinese maize could be achieved by ridge furrow or lateral spacing with plastic mulch li et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 we expect large gains in wp through the adoption of optimal management practices management strategies that aim to increase wp must be tailored to local conditions i e climate factors soil properties and management practices passioura 1977 passioura and angus 2010 ali and talukder 2008 brauman et al 2013 4 3 limitations and uncertainties we analyzed data provided by a large number of publications that spanned multiple environments and field management practices in china to better understand the current wp status assess related environmental factors and managements practices and establish a wp function that will provide a reference value and guidance for improving practices aimed at increasing wp however our analysis also identified gaps in data and knowledge first other integrated management and climate factors that might affect wp such as integrated soil crop system management soil management and crops aboveground management and solar radiation were not taken into considered because the published data were insufficient hence in the future greater attention to experimental details and study site conditions should be provided in all published studies secondly the majority of experiments in this analysis were conducted at agricultural experiment research stations where conditions can be carefully controlled as a consequence our meta analysis did not accurately reflect the situation in farmers fields for example farmers often overuse irrigation with unsuitable irrigation methods and the crop management maybe suboptimal and thus wp is likely greater in well managed experiments than when the same practices are applied by farmers in production fields future research should focus on collecting measurements from farmers management to generate more realistic results finally there is a lack of information reported on water losses in most of studies hence we could not consider the effect of water losses on water supply and the actual water supply may have been an overestimation of the actual crop water use and the wp was been underestimated in the future more attention should be focused on measuring or estimating of water losses to improve the accuracy of future results 5 conclusions across a large set of maize experiments between 2000 and 2018 for china the mean wp was 22 kg ha 1 mm 1 wp varied with latitude vpd st n application agro ecological zone year and farming management practices we identified large potential for improving the wp and estimated the boundary function for wp has slope of 42 5 36 8 and 40 4 kg

ranked by their akaike s information criteria with corrections for small sample sizes aicc we followed the procedures of burnham et al 2011 to perform model averaging we extracted the coefficient for each moderator from this confidence set as the weighted average of each coefficient across models containing that moderator using the aicc to weight wi each model ndac et al 2018 because we standardized inputs for the moderators the model averaged coefficients had comparable scales and we therefore chose not to back transform the moderators to their original scales 2 3 2 analyses of management practices to identify effective crop management practices for improving maize wp and yield we pooled studies that included side by side comparisons of different crop management practices i e the treatment was the same as the control in all aspects except for the each crop management practice and calculated effect sizes for pairwise comparisons optimal irrigation vs farmer irrigation plastic mulch vs no mulch straw re incorporation vs no straw re incorporation deep tillage deep ripping vs rotary tillage no tillage vs rotary tillage ridge planting vs flat planting and polymer application vs no polymer application the farmers irrigation was specifically specified in the published paper or it was clearly explained the irrigation technology followed the local farmers methods drip irrigation and sprinkling irrigation were assigned to the optimal irrigation category the contrasting procedures were traditional irrigation the ridge planting is a catchment agriculture technology that involves building ridges and furrows in the field with crops planted in the ridge or furrows other paired management practices were also categorized based on previous peer reviewed reports the effects of different management measures on different variables x were assessed in the form of natural log of the response ratio rrs hedges et al 1999 and the detailed method referenced by zheng et al 2019 the results were estimated by r 1 100 under treatment effects huang et al 2015 xia et al 2017 if the 95 confidence intervals cis did not superimpose on zero the differences were considered significant a positive or negative value indicated an increase or decreased in the response variable under different management practices respectively prior to the analysis we checked the data assumptions of the procedures using the residuals of the fitted model kozak and piepho 2017 2 3 3 current wp and boundary function the boundary functions for wp was determined by quantile regression for the relationship between maize yield and seasonal water supply using ibm spss statistics 19 0 lin and liu 2016 grassini et al 2015 first we followed the classification concept of quantile regression and ranked yield data points based on water supply then the 95th percentile of yield data points using 20 mm class intervals were selected as the upper boundary lin and liu 2017 and finally were used to fit the boundary line the slope line of the fitted boundary function indicates the highest yield at a given seasonal water supply level it means the highest attainable wp potential the fitted boundary function was y wpp water supply x because yield does not always increase with seasonal water supply the boundary function follows a linear plateau model sadras and angus 2006 before reaching the plateau with the function was y plateau value the 95th percentile of yield as the yield plateau 3 results 3 1 current wp and boundary function the maize grain yield from 282 published articles covering 442 site years averaged 9 81 mg ha 1 fig 1 and the wp averaged 22 3 kg ha 1 mm 1 and ranged from 6 to 45 kg ha 1 mm 1 fig 1 the mean wp followed the order ne mean 25 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 95 cis 25 6 26 9 kg ha 1 mm 1 range 15 38 kg ha 1 mm 1 ncp mean 22 3 kg ha 1 mm 1 95 cis 21 7 22 5 kg ha 1 mm 1 range 6 42 kg ha 1 mm 1 nw mean 21 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 95 cis 21 2 22 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 range 7 45 kg ha 1 mm 1 fig 1 the highest wp in ne was attributed to relatively higher average yield 11 11 mg ha 1 although the grain yield of nw was also relatively high 10 71 mg ha 1 the wp was relatively low due to its relatively higher water supply mean 519 mm fig 1 we established the wp boundary function with relationship between maize yield and water supply across different agro ecological zones the boundary function for wp had slopes of 42 5 36 8 and 40 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 for nw ncp and ne respectively fig 2 this wp function proved to be a robust benchmark when compared with actual yield and water supply data and indicated a large potential for improvement of maize wp 3 2 factors and management practices influencing wp yield and et model averaged parameter estimates indicated that the standardized effect size which is defined as the effect value after standardization of the independent variable for latitude was 3 489 95 cis 4 55 to 2 427 vpd 0 405 0 562 to 0 247 n rate 0 043 0 027 to 0 06 st 1 236 0 777 1 694 the agro ecological zones 0 452 0 281 to 0 623 and the experimental year 0 026 0 020 to 0 032 these had larger effects on wp than other moderators fig 3 supplementary table 3 these four moderators had the lowest aicc values for wp according to the model selection analysis table 1 and were included in the model wp was also correlated though but not significantly with plant density maize varieties and som the responses of yield and water supply on the same moderators were not the same as wp fig 3 table 1 for example sp increased both maize yield and water supply but did not significantly affect wp similarly plant density was positively related with both yield and water supply and had no effect on wp the st increased maize yield thus improved wp but there was no significant relationship between water supply and st fig 3 supplementary table 2 the wp yield and water supply were moderately correlated with management practices fig 4 both wp and yield were increased significantly by 6 59 and 18 12 with optimal irrigation compared with traditional irrigation management polymer and ridge planting increased wp due to decreased seasonal water supply both plastic mulch and straw re incorporation significantly improved wp by 17 28 and 12 64 respectively due to markedly increasing yield and reducing water supply the deep tillage deep ripping factor had a significant effect on wp which was attributed to a large significant increase in yield 4 discussion 4 1 wp comparisons between our study and previous estimates the estimated wp between 2000 and 2018 in the northern china was 22 kg ha 1 mm 1 which is substantially higher than that determined in previous research on irrigated maize in china 17 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 deng et al 2006 in this study the wp of maize production was estimated based on data from experimental plots in general experimental plots were managed carefully under optimal conditions e g nutrient supply pest management tillage and irrigation technology which together increased the wp furthermore the introductions of new cultivars and improved management practices in recent years have improved both yield and wp zhang et al 2011a 2011b most data used in the study by deng et al 2006 were collected before 2000 whereas we used data collected after 2000 this difference in timing likely contributed to the disparity in wp estimates our estimated wp was higher than 18 kg ha 1 mm 1 of global average zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 and 19 7 kg ha 1 mm 1 of the western american maize belt average grassini et al 2011 the higher wp in china is partly explained by some field management measures such as plastic mulch and deep tillage deep ripping similar results were reported that the plastic mulch increased wp by 22 9 relative no mulching dong et al 2018 less irrigation water and low rainfall in the northern china also contributed to high wp for maize production 4 2 wp responses to environmental factors and management measures we calculated a broad range of wp values in northern china range 6 45 kg ha 1 mm 1 fig 1 and indicated a large potential for wp improvement the variations in wp between and within zones were caused by multiple factors in our study the latitude was the largest contribution to wp followed by st regions vpd som years n application plant density and variety similar research reported that the wp was correlated with latitude zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 hatfield et al 1999 reduced n application deceased yield hatfield et al 2001 ogola et al 2002 thus wp responded positively to n rate as reported in previous studies hatfield et al 2001 major increases in both wp and yield over time have been attributed to the introduction of new cultivars and optimal management practices that have increased maize yield or and lowered water supply zhang et al 2011a 2011b lu et al 2016 previous studies also reported that vpd significantly affect wp rattalino edreira et al 2018 across all management procedures fig 4 wp was positively correlated with optimal irrigation polymer plastic mulch straw re incorporation deep tillage and ridge planting for example sprinkler and drip irrigation could reduce the amount of water leached from the root zone thus increasing the water available for et and plant growth romero et al 2006 el hendawy and mohamed 2008 polymer increases water storage capacity and prevents loss of water from the rhizosphere thereby decreasing the negative effects of water stress mahalleh et al 2011 fallahi et al 2015 plastic mulch had a significant effect on maize wp because it could reduce soil evaporation and increase early season soil temperature which accelerates germination and increases yield in temperate climates zhou et al 2009 thereby significantly increasing yield and wp straw re incorporation increased both soil quality and soil water holding capacity thus improving wp fan et al 2005 wang et al 2018a 2018b ridge planting contributed to increased soil temperature which significantly increased wp he et al 2010 the ridge area was never compacted and was left undisturbed except during planting and tillage operations producing a zone with soil conditions conductive to higher soil moisture and crop yields kaspar et al 1995 relative to shallow rotary tillage deep cultivation may have alleviated the restriction imposed on root depth and root density and promoted the absorption of water and nutrients by roots bennie and botha 1986 and thus increased maize yield and wp there was no significant overall effect of no tillage on maize yield and wp which disagreed with a meta analysis by wang et al 2018a 2018b other research has indicated the effects of no tillage on wp and yield depend on climate soil properties no till duration and irrigation patterns rainfed or irrigated pittelkow et al 2015 wang et al 2018a 2018b in this study the wp boundary function had slopes of 42 5 36 8 and 40 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 in nw ncp and ne respectively previous studies reported that these values were 47 5 kg ha 1 mm 1 and even 60 5 kg ha 1 mm 1 under plastic mulch in china lin and liu 2016 the wp boundary function was reported as 49 kg ha 1 mm 1 for global maize production bastiaanssen and steduto 2017 and 37 kg ha 1 mm 1 in the us maize belt grassini et al 2009 overall our studies indicated that a large wp potential should be achievable in the future some on farm experiments indicated that the wp boundary function of chinese maize could be achieved by ridge furrow or lateral spacing with plastic mulch li et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 we expect large gains in wp through the adoption of optimal management practices management strategies that aim to increase wp must be tailored to local conditions i e climate factors soil properties and management practices passioura 1977 passioura and angus 2010 ali and talukder 2008 brauman et al 2013 4 3 limitations and uncertainties we analyzed data provided by a large number of publications that spanned multiple environments and field management practices in china to better understand the current wp status assess related environmental factors and managements practices and establish a wp function that will provide a reference value and guidance for improving practices aimed at increasing wp however our analysis also identified gaps in data and knowledge first other integrated management and climate factors that might affect wp such as integrated soil crop system management soil management and crops aboveground management and solar radiation were not taken into considered because the published data were insufficient hence in the future greater attention to experimental details and study site conditions should be provided in all published studies secondly the majority of experiments in this analysis were conducted at agricultural experiment research stations where conditions can be carefully controlled as a consequence our meta analysis did not accurately reflect the situation in farmers fields for example farmers often overuse irrigation with unsuitable irrigation methods and the crop management maybe suboptimal and thus wp is likely greater in well managed experiments than when the same practices are applied by farmers in production fields future research should focus on collecting measurements from farmers management to generate more realistic results finally there is a lack of information reported on water losses in most of studies hence we could not consider the effect of water losses on water supply and the actual water supply may have been an overestimation of the actual crop water use and the wp was been underestimated in the future more attention should be focused on measuring or estimating of water losses to improve the accuracy of future results 5 conclusions across a large set of maize experiments between 2000 and 2018 for china the mean wp was 22 kg ha 1 mm 1 wp varied with latitude vpd st n application agro ecological zone year and farming management practices we identified large potential for improving the wp and estimated the boundary function for wp has slope of 42 5 36 8 and 40 4 kg

10636,disposal of human excreta derived materials hedm particularly domestic wastewater presents a challenge in areas served with on site sanitation systems most particular in informal settlements the use of hedm for agricultural food production represents a couple of opportunities such as improved sanitation household food security as well as the generation of informal income in this study tomato seedlings monica cv were grown in a hydroponic system and irrigated with hedm effluents from decentralized wastewater treatment system and nitrified urine concentrate a commercial hydroponic fertilizer mixture was used concurrently as a control treatment all the treatments were applied to the plants through fertigation using a drip irrigation system plant growth plant height stem diameter leaf area index root shoot ratio and plant dry matter physiological photosynthesis and chlorophyll yield components fruit number fruit mass harvest index and crop yield leaf nutrient composition n p k mg ca cu mn fe zn and na and microbiological aerobic count coliforms and faecal coliforms parameters were measured to assess the potential of these hedms as nutrient sources for hydroponically produced tomatoes the results showed that irrigating the tomatoes with hedm increased harvest index relative to crops irrigated with a commercial hydroponic fertilizer mix tomato plants irrigated with a commercial hydroponic fertilizer mix achieved the highest growth and yield however irrigation with human excreta based sources improved plant physiological performance and leaf nutrient composition compared to crops irrigated with commercial fertilizer mix in terms of microbiological analysis tomatoes harvested from plants treated with hedm recorded the highest population of bacterial count as compared to the commercial hydroponic fertilizer mix these results showed that nutrients derived from human excreta can be a good source of nutrients for hydroponically grown tomatoes moreover this practice can effectively address the challenges of human waste disposal while at the same time providing the much needed resources for increased food production through urban agriculture however further research on the effect of heavy metals pathogens on tomato fruit quality is still needed for the adaptation of wastewater as nutrients sources for hydroponically grown tomatoes keywords urban agriculture fertilizer wastewater hydroponic system tomato 1 introduction the use of human excreta derived materials hedm for agricultural crop production has been encouraged as an ecological sanitation approach to promoting closed loop flows of resources such as nutrients from sanitation to agricultural systems this approach seeks to address the shortcomings of sanitation and food production systems by creating a paradigm shift on how human waste is perceived and managed human excreta contains most of the nutrients required for plant growth and is partially being viewed as a resource not a waste to be discarded the majority of the macronutrients are found in the urine fraction with the contribution of about 80 of nitrogen and 45 of phosphorus jönsson et al 2005 the nitrogen contained in urine is mainly in the form of ammonium with 85 100 of it being plant available as in chemical fertilizers due to its ionic form jönsson et al 2000 recycling the nutrients contained in human excreta as fertilizers for crop production can help reduce the energy and chemical costs associated with wastewater treatment likewise this can reduce the environmental burden caused by the use of non renewable resources for the production of synthetic fertilizers many studies have demonstrated the suitability and benefits of using human excreta derived materials as potential nutrients on arable land adeoluwa and cofie 2012 anderson 2015 krause and rotter 2018 this is more evident through the establishment of the decentralised system through which nutrient recovery and wastewater treatment are provided maure et al 2006 wohlsager et al 2010 if properly managed decentralised wastewater treatment systems dewats offer opportunities for the treatment of wastewater close to the source of its generation to a quality that can be discharged into local water sources and reused for agriculture without negative effects on health and environment gutterer et al 2009 the basic technical treatment of the system consists of three steps namely primary treatment sedimentation and floatation secondary treatment usually suspended bed reactors anaerobic baffled reactors and fixed bed anaerobic filters and tertiary treatment sub surface flow filters and polishing ponds the anaerobic baffle reactor abr is efficient for the removal of organic materials and suspended solids from domestic wastewater however effluents treated with this process have a high concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus accompanied by a high level of pathogenic organisms which are partially reduced during the treatment process collivignarelli et al 1990 using partially treated or raw wastewater for irrigation of agricultural crops is associated with the transfer of pathogens which may cause serious illness and other related health risks when used for human consumption dickin et al 2016 as a result control measures that can help minimize the risk of contamination of crops when domestic wastewater is used for irrigation and fertilization need to be selected and managed accordingly the selection of appropriate methods of wastewater treatment along with some control of its use and quality is reported to have the ability of minimising the health and environmental problems related to the agricultural reuse of domestic wastewater lubello et al 2004 another approach used to maximize nutrient removal and recovery is the separate collection of urine using source separation toilets such as urine diversion toilets udts these toilets enable the collection of waste components separately by allowing the collection of urine in a front end bowl and feaces in the rear ended bowl beal et al 2008 münch and dahm 2009 several studies have indicated that out of all the nutrients in municipal wastewater about 80 of n and 50 of p originates from urine making human urine a good source of fertilizer langergraber and muellegger 2005 ammonia is a volatile gas that exists in chemical equilibrium with the ammonium ion the equilibrium is ph dependent and higher ph values promote ammonia formation and thus volatilization by microbiologically transforming half of the ammonium ions into nitrate ions essentially forming ammonium nitrate solution the ammonia can be stabilized in solution this solution is basically concentrated 20 fold in an evaporator to produce a concentrated urine derived fertilizer nitrified urine concentrate nuc integrating wastewater treatment systems with plant growth systems that can allow continuous use of wastewater is one promising solution that can increase the adoption of domestic wastewater reuse this can be achieved by developing sanitation technologies for the recovery of nutrients that can be used for growing crops while at the same time providing solutions to the problems of water scarcities nutrient depletion and waste disposal wastewater hydroponic system is a concept formulated through an approach that integrates wastewater treatment and hydroponic crop production norström et al 2003 in wastewater hydroponic system nutrients which are recovered or generated through the biological breakdown of domestic organic wastes are absorbed by plants grown in a hydroponic culture system the hydroponic system component acts as a biofilter in which the nutrient rich effluents are taken up by the plants to produce biomass thus generating wastewater with a negligible amount of nitrogen and phosphorus that can be safely disposed to the environment tomato plant is mostly produced hydroponically and requires a significant amount of nutrients particularly nitrogen phosphorus potassium and calcium for crop growth and yield in hedms nitrogen phosphorus and potassium are found in high amounts compared to other elements schouw et al 2002 the fertilizer value of human urine n p k is reported to be 18 2 5 linden 1997 and the ratio for urine mixed with flush water can be 15 1 3 1 of n p k s respectively palmquist and jönsson 2004 although p n and k n ratios in urine based fertilizers are relatively lower compared to synthetic fertilizers the ionic form of both phosphorus and potassium makes it readily available for plant absorption upon application kirchmann and peterson 1995 this study aims to evaluate the effect of effluents from anaerobic baffled reactor and nitrified urine concentrate on growth and yield of hydroponically grown tomatoes 2 materials and methods 2 1 nutrient sources 2 1 1 decentralised wastewater treatment system dewats effluents the dewats effluent used for this experiment was sourced from a decentralised wastewater treatment system which is a demonstration plant situated at ethekwini municipality in durban south africa 29 46 25 648 e 30 58 28 329 s the system serves 80 households which are connected by one sewer system around newlands mashu and collects wastewater from washbasins showers kitchen sinks laundry and toilets wastes the wastewater used for this study was first treated in the plant which encompasses a sequence of a primary settling chamber anaerobic baffled reactor abr and a secondary anaerobic filter the effluent from the anaerobic baffled reactor was collected into a tank and used as a nutrient source influent and effluent wastewater samples were collected on a weekly and fortnight basis from the hydroponic treatment systems depending throughout the growing season for the purpose of characterization and performance evaluation the following parameters were determined based on standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater dissolved oxygen do ammonium nh4 n and nitrate no3 n total phosphorus po4 3 total suspended solids content tss and the levels of biochemical oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod temperatures and ph were measured on site during sample collection using handheld portable water quality measuring instruments digital thermometer wt 1 and ph meter cp 105 the efﬁciency of pollutant removal in the wastewater treatment plant were assessed on the basis of environmental protection agency epa regulations the samples were stored in a freezer at 20 c and later sent to talbot laboratories pty ltd for analysis physicochemical characteristics of the nutrient solutions used for this study wastewater abr effluents a mixture of commercial hydroponic fertilizer mix chfm and nutrified urine concentrate nuc are presented in table 1 2 1 2 nitrified urine concentrate nuc nitrified urine concentrate a fertilizer developed by researchers from the vuna valorisation of urine nutrients for africa projects was used for this study nutrients contained in the source separated urine were stabilized by means of biological processes nitrification and distillation whereby the urine is stabilized and concentrated udert and wächter 2012 the liquid was concentrated 20 fold to produce a high nutrient content fertilizer the product is reported to contain comparable amounts of nutrients with most chemical nitrogen fertilizers jönsson et al 2004 to ascertain the chemical composition of the nuc used in this study samples were sent to talbot and talbot laboratories camps drift pietermaritzburg south africa for analysis and results are also presented in table 1 2 1 3 commercial hydroponic fertilizer mix the commercial hydroponic fertilizer mix was used as an experimental control solution comprised of hygroponic and solu cal sourced from hygrotech pty ltd pietermaritzburg south africa the solution was prepared based on the recommended ratio of 600 g 490 g 1000 l of hygroponic and solu cal respectively from transplanting to first truss and 800 g 620 g from the first truss to harvesting 2 2 experimental details and procedures to investigate the suitability of human excreta for tomato production a hydroponic system designed to run three nutrients streams namely decentralized wastewater treatment system dewats effluents nitrified urine concentrate nuc commercial hydroponic fertilizer mix chfm was used each hydroponic system consisted of 150 l reservoir units and the nutrient solution for each system was contained in a 100 l container stacked on the ground at the foot of each system two weeks old tomato seedlings of cv monica were chosen for this study because they are a short season determinate type of breed the seedlings were transplanted into 30 cm polyethylene pots and the entire hydroponic system was set up in a greenhouse at newlands mashu research station under ethekwini municipality kwazulu natal south africa a pressure pump supplied the nutrient solution up through a 20 m irrigation line along the length of the benches were the pots were placed a 20 cm drip irrigation emitters 2 l h were placed and irrigation was performed at six intervals of 5 min duration daily using a timer snyder 2020 the study was arranged using a complete randomised design with three replications giving fifteen experimental units of five plants each tomato plants were irrigated with a commercial hydroponic fertilizer mix hygroponic and solu cal at the rate of 800 g 620 g 1000 l of water as recommended for hydroponic tomato production for the nuc treatment the commercial fertilizer application rate value was used as a standard as recommended by jönsson et al 2004 who proposed that urine based fertilizers contain equal amounts of nutrients compared to traditional fertilizers the urine nitrogen content was used as the determining factor for the nutrient content of nuc because nitrogen is considered a limiting factor for plant growth and the most dominant nutrient in human urine jönsson et al 2004 no specified application rate was used for the dewats effluent treatment the only effluent from the anaerobic baffled reactor component was used both as nutrient and irrigation source the experiment was allowed to run for 12 weeks before the crop was harvested 2 3 data collection plant height was measured using a measuring tape placed at the base of the stem to the tips of the leaves and stem diameter was measured at harvest using a caliper leaf area index lai was determined using an lai 2200 li 2200 li cor lincolin nebraska usa at harvest by taking five readings per plant one reading above the canopy and four readings below canopy chlorophyll concentration index cci was measured using a portable chlorophyll meter spad 502 minolta corp ramsey nj usa the chlorophyll content was taken twice at six weeks after transplanting and after flowering on the uppermost fully expanded leaf of each plant the determination of photosynthetic rate a μmol co2 m 2 s 1 was done using the li 6400 xt portable photosynthesis system li cor bioscience lincoln nebraska usa artificial saturating photosynthetic active radiation par of

6400 01 li cor biosciences lincoln ne usa the flow rate of water and relative humidity were maintained at 500 μmol and 43 respectively the leaf to air vapour pressure deficit vpd was kept at 1 7 kpa to prevent stomatal closure tomato plants were harvested at 12 weeks for all the experimental treatments roots and shoots were separated and weighed for both fresh and dry mass the roots were thoroughly rinsed with distilled water plant materials were dried in an oven at 60 c to constant weight to measure both shoot and root dry weight plant samples were then milled to 1 mm mesh wire for the analysis of shoot macro and micro nutrient the samples were sent to the soil fertility and analytical services laboratory cedara kzn department of agriculture and environmental affairs shoot mineral content were analysed using icp aes for micro and macronutrients rodda et al 2011 yield and yield components number of fruits fruit mass total yield per plant and harvest index were also measured after harvest the harvest index hi was measured by taking the ratio of fruit fresh mass to plant total fresh mass the hi was determined based on fresh mass because hi units are functional to their use as marketable units and tomato plants are marketed mostly on their fresh state 2 4 pathogenic characteristics 2 4 1 bacterial counts sample preparation five green and five red tomatoes were collected from the three different nutrient sources dewats nuc and chfm making a total of 30 tomatoes these were divided in to six batches dewatsr ripe fruit samples from decentralized wastewater treatment system dewatsg green fruit samples from decentralized wastewater treatment system nucr ripe fruit samples from nitrified urine concentrate nucg green fruit sample from nitrified urine concentrate chfmr ripe fruits samples from commercial hydroponic fertilizer mix chfmg green fruit samples from commercial hydroponic fertilizer mix the harvested fruits showed no disease symptoms wounds or any other damages and they were immediately subjected to experimentation after harvest using each batch at a time tomato fruit samples were surface sterilized by submerging them for 30 s in 70 ethanol 30 s in 1 sodium hypochlorite and triple rinsed for 30 s in sterile distilled water thereafter the samples were air dried in a laminar flow cabinet under aseptic conditions and each sample was diced into small pieces and placed in a sterile glass beaker using a flame sterilized scalpel the sample was blended using a stick blender logik ac 230 v 50hz 200 w kb until it was homogenised 2 4 2 enumeration isolation and identification of total coliforms faecal coliforms and aerobic counts enumeration was carried out by plating the aliquot and placed them in a fresh nutrient agar na macconkey mac and eosin methylene blue emb agar selective for aerobic count coliforms and faecal coliforms respectively with three replications each the plates were then incubated at 37 c for 48 h and the number of colonies formed at each plate was counted and recorded this was converted to colony forming units per ml cfu ml morphologically different colonies on na mac and emb were selected and subcultured on to fresh na using the 3 way streak method this was to better differentiate between the cultures and to ensure that the selected cultures were morphological different the plates were then appropriately labelled and incubated at 37 c for 48 h thereafter 30 glycerol was prepared by diluting 30 ml absolute glycerol in 70 ml distilled water the solution was autoclaved at 121 c for 15 min using a micropipette 1 ml aliquot was transferred into sterile 2 ml eppendorf tubes thereafter a loopful of culture was transferred from a pure culture plate into and eppendorf tube containing sterile 30 glycerol 2 5 statistical analyses data collected from measured variables were subjected to analysis of variance anova using genstat version 18 vsn international hemel hempstead uk treatment

unscrambler x v10 5 camo software as oslo science park norway to test the level of association among experimental variables 3 results 3 1 effect of nutrient source on growth plant biomass and shoot nutrient composition of hydroponically produced tomatoes both human excreta derived materials dewats effluent and nuc reported low crop growth and yield compared to the chemical hydroponic fertilizer mix tables 2 and 3 plants treated with nuc produced lower shoot dry mass 13 90 g and root dry mass 4 70 g compared to the plants treated with chfm with the mass of 44 56 g and 12 23 g respectively biomass of plants treated with dewats effluents was also lower with shoot dry mass recording 5 90 g while the root dry mass was 6 13 g however the root shoot ratio was higher in the dewats effluents

showed a higher lai 1 8 than the dewats 1 5 effluents as for shoot nutrient composition significant differences were observed between the three nutrient sources shoots of tomatoes grown in nuc had a high n p cu fe and na content and lower k ca than those grown in dewats effluents and chfm treatments tables 3 and 4 a high concentration of ca content was detected in the shoots of tomato treated

observed between the three nutrient sources treatment shoots of tomatoes grown in nuc had a high n p cu fe and na content and lower ca than those grown in dewats effluents and chfm treatments table 3 however both nuc and dewats treated plants recorded the same level of k which was significantly lower than the chfm treated plants a high rate of ca content was detected in the shoots of tomato treated with effluents from dewats treatment system compared with nuc and a similar pattern was observed on mg and zn content table 4 3 2 plant chlorophyll content index and photosynthetic rate as affected by nutrient sources significantly different response in plant physiological performance was observed in the present study as shown in fig 1 plants treated with dewats effluents had a high photosynthetic rate 22 76 μmol co2 m 2 s 1 which was comparable to the plants in the control treatment 22 40 μmol co2 m 2 s 1 on the other hand nuc treated plants had the lowest photosynthetic rate 14 46 μmol co2 m 2 s 1 the chlorophyll content index cci of the plants was significantly different among the three nutrients sources plants treated with nuc reported the highest cci 46 64 followed by the plants treated with commercial hydroponic mix 37 84 with dewats effluents treated plants recording the lowest cci 25 49 3 3 comparing the effect of dewats effluents nuc and chemical hydroponic fertilizer mix on yield and yield component parameters fig 2 indicates crop yield and yield components variables fruit mass fruit number harvest index and yield among the nutrient sources there were significant differences in fruit mass fruit number harvest index and yield across the treatments the chfm showed the highest fruit mass 108 g plant 1 fruit number 7 4 fruit plant 1 and yield 408 46 g plant 1 as compared with nuc and dewats effluents in contrast tomato plants treated with dewats effluents attained higher harvest index 0 68 than plants treated with nuc 0 51 and chfm 0 50 among the plants treated with human excreta nutrient sources the dewats effluents showed higher fruit mass harvest index and yield compared to nuc treatment 3 4 pathogen concentration on the fruits of hydroponically grown tomatoes quantification of total aerobic mesophiles total and faecal coliforms are the most important microorganisms used to assess when raw or treated wastewater is used to irrigate agricultural crops ottoson et al 2005 the impact of nutrient sources on the abundance of aerobic count total coliforms and faecal coliforms on tomato fruits at harvest was evaluated table 5 there were no significant p 0 05 differences in the abundance of aerobic count enumerated in green fruits among the treatments total coliforms and faecal coliforms were never detected for all the treatment samples except for nuc where insignificant amount were enumerated the only effect of nutrients sources on pathogenic bacteria in the fruits was found on the red fruit with high microbial load enumerated in fruits harvested from dewats treated plants compared to the other two treatments fruits harvested from dewats treatment enumerated the majority of the selected pathogenic bacteria and their frequency was comparable with the red fruit nuc treated plants showed reduced frequency and population of bacteria in the fruits for both green and red fruits the microbial load between chfm and nuc treatments were not significantly p 0 05 different for the both unripe ad ripened fruits 3 5 principal component and correlation analysis the principal component analysis was conducted to visualize the association between growth physiological yield and mineral content parameters under different nutrient sources fig 3 principal components pc 1 and pc 2 accounted for 92 of total variability among the tested parameters under different sources of nutrients pc 1 and pc 2 accounted for 57 and 35 of the total variation respectively among the nutrient sources used for this experiment dewats effluents treatment was differentiated by high photosynthetic rate root shoot ratio harvest index ca and zn nuc treatment was differentiated by high chlorophyll content index n p mn fe and na content while chfm was characterized by high shoot and root dry matter stem diameter plant height leaf area index fruit number yield and k content fig 3 4 discussion the study evaluated the use of effluents from anaerobic baffled reactor and nitrified urine concentrate as alternative nutrient sources for hydroponic production of tomatoes generally plant growth performance physiology yield and yield components of tomato plants were significantly higher in plants treated with chfm which was used as a control along with dewats effluents and nuc one reason for the observed differences in the control treatment is that the fertilizer mix used was commercially formulated to meet the nutrient requirement of tomato plants grown in a hydroponic system meanwhile the nutrients from hedms dewats effluents and nuc were not adjusted to meet the crop requirements of tomato for the dewats effluents treated plants only wastewater collected from the sewer system was used as nutrient sources whereas for the nuc treatment only nitrogen content of the fertilizer was used as a determinant for the application rate using the commercial fertilizer mix as a benchmark the use of nitrogen content as a determining factor for application rate was based on the recommendations made by jönsson et al 2004 who suggested that human urine s nitrogen content is the same as the one contained in the chemical fertilizer consequently these resulted in plants treated with commercial fertilizer mix to have a higher growth response compared to those from human excreta derived materials the reported decrease in plant growth and dry matter production on plants treated with dewats effluents compared to the other nutrients sources can be attributed to its poor supply for macronutrients n p and k which are essential for plant growth and development this was demonstrated by the lower concentration of these nutrients in the shoots of tomato plants treated with this nutrient source in addition the low chlorophyll content reported on the plants treated with this nutrient source is also indicative of low nutrient supply for the dewats effluents especially nitrogen since chlorophyll content is also used as a physiological determinant for nitrogen status of plants bojović and marković 2009 the use of chlorophyll content as a measure of nitrogen content is as a result of its critical role on the synthesis of photosynthetic proteins demotes mainard et al 2008 in addition the observed high root shoot ratio of plants treated with dewats effluents compared to chfm and nuc treated plants was also an indication for the effect of low nitrogen concentration on plant growth performance a lot of research has established that limited nitrogen in plants tends to produce more roots relative to shoots as a way of adaptation to environmental stress nacry et al 2013 agren and franklin 2003 based on the current findings these results revealed that using dewats effluents as a nutrient source exposed the plants to nutrient stress particularly n p k the main reason for poor nutrient supply is the fact that the amount of macro and micronutrients contained in wastewater is unstable they may be in excess or deficient thus limiting for plant growth almuktar et al 2015 on the other hand plants treated with this nutrient source reported a high photosynthetic rate fruit mass and harvest index the increase in fruit mass is associated with the low number of fruits per tree observed from this study this eliminated competition among fruits in terms of light water and nutrients thus increasing fruit size these results suggest that if dewats effluent is to be recommended for the production of tomatoes using the hydroponic system nutrients contained in the effluents need to be adjusted and supplemented to meet the crop s nutrient requirements contrary to dewats effluents plants treated with nuc reported improved growth performances in terms of shoot dry matter leaf area index and chlorophyll content the direct increase can be attributed to the high concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus contained in the nuc fertilizer which are necessary for plant growth and development these results corroborate those of bohdziewicz et al 2015 who reported a high chlorophyll content in onion plants irrigated with fermented urine the increase in chlorophyll content for plants treated with human urine is associated with the high nitrogen content of human urine jönsson et al 2004 however in this study plants treated with this fertilizer reported lower rates of photosynthesis as well as yield compared to the plants treated with dewats effluents and chfm the reduction in yield performance can be related to the formation of very dark green and weakened plants which further resulted in the development of bottom end rot ber as observed in this study low concentration of calcium is known as a possible secondary factor in the development of ber and this is caused by high n ca mg ca and k ca ratios in a nutrient solution for hydroponically produced tomatoes pavadikovic et al 2010 under this condition plants preferably take up nitrogen potassium and magnesium instead of calcium reducing the quality of tomatoes and yet increasing the risk of ber among the plant nutrients excess nitrogen particularly ammonium is known to be the major contributor of ber as a result of antagonistic interactions that exist for nutrient uptake taylor and locascio 2007 similar observations were found for this study in which the nuc fertilizer had a higher nh4 ca 1 234 and k ca 1 100 ratios which increased the incidence of ber yield reduction for the nuc treated plants this was further demonstrated by the high concentration of nitrogen and low concentration of calcium magnesium and potassium on tomato shoots treated with nuc compared to dewats effluents and commercial hydroponic mix moreover calcium ions are known to be less mobile within the plant vascular system therefore their limited supply in soil nutrient solution results in reduced uptake by plants barrientos priego et al 2016 the poor performance of photosynthetic rate on nuc treated plants might be the result of concentration dilution effect which results when mineral nutrient concentration increases at a faster rate than dry matter accumulation riedell 2010 the plant used more of its energy reserves on nutrient absorption than carbohydrates assimilation gill et al 2011 a similar pattern was observed in the current results in which plants from the nuc had lower dry matter production and high concentration of shoot nitrogen and phosphorus paralleled to chfm treated plants which produced higher dry matter compared to shoot nitrogen concentration plants treated with dewats effluents and nuc accumulated higher concentration of na in the shoots than plants treated with chfm the na content for human excreta derived nutrient sources may be one of the reasons which resulted in reduced plant growth due to na toxicity tester and davenport 2003 previous studies on the salinity effect of na demonstrated the dominance of na for many plant species as a reason for ion specific damage during salt stress tavakkoli et al 2010 toxicity of na affects plant metabolic processes through its ability to compete with k binding sites and crops grown under such conditions may suffer both the effect of na toxicity and low k concentration munns and tester 2008 in addition a higher concentration of na inhibits the acquisition and distribution of essential nutrients such as k ca2 and no3 maathuis 2014 in the present study the high level of sodium ion might be the cause for the low crop productivity of plants treated with these nutrient sources these results showed that the use of domestic wastewater effluent dewats for the irrigation of hydroponically grown tomatoes presents high risks of pathogen contamination contrasting results were found by oyama et al 2005 where the use of hydroponically grown tomatoes reduced the level of faecal coliforms by 73 aerobic counts showed to have dominance over faecal coliform and coliforms and their strains were detected in all the treatments however the source of infection could not be entirely established since only samples from the fruits were taken for analysis future studies need to consider sampling from the source which includes soil growth medium irrigation water leaves and the edible parts of the plants to establish the source of infection 5 conclusion the use of nitrified urine concentrates and effluents from anaerobic baffle reactor as a nutrient and water source for hydroponic tomato production can be an alternative for domestic wastewater treatment this process presents some beneficial effects on fruit growth and yield thus under dewats effluents treatment plant height photosynthetic rate fruit mass harvest index and nutrient uptake mg 2 ca 2 zn2 and fe 2 were improved compared to the control treatment plants treated with nitrified urine concentrate showed a significant increase in chlorophyll content and nutrient uptake n p cu2 mn 2 zn2 and fe 2 this study presents a new opportunity for hydroponic tomato production through the use of dewats effluent from anaerobic wastewater treatment system and human urine from nitrification and distillation process the symptoms of nitrogen deficiency on plants treated with dewats effluents is indicative that tomato plants can be used as a suitable crop for agricultural wastewater use because most of the nutrient is used by the plants for biomass production however the main setback of the proposed alternatives is the effect of these nutrient sources on yield and the presence of pathogens in this sense precaution needs to be taken when dewats effluents and nuc are used for hydroponic tomato production further clarification on the phytotoxic element accumulation dynamics inside the plant organs should be deeply investigated thus further research that will focus on nutrient balances and maximization of these nutrient sources for optimum hydroponic tomato production is required the understanding of the processes that affect nutrient transformation and availability to plants such as nutrient retention time nitrification and the role of temperature ec and ph needs to be further investigated most importantly the effect of nutrient toxicity heavy metals and pharmaceuticals on the edible parts of tomatoes is also required declaration of competing interest the authors declare

10636,disposal of human excreta derived materials hedm particularly domestic wastewater presents a challenge in areas served with on site sanitation systems most particular in informal settlements the use of hedm for agricultural food production represents a couple of opportunities such as improved sanitation household food security as well as the generation of informal income in this study tomato seedlings monica cv were grown in a hydroponic system and irrigated with hedm effluents from decentralized wastewater treatment system and nitrified urine concentrate a commercial hydroponic fertilizer mixture was used concurrently as a control treatment all the treatments were applied to the plants through fertigation using a drip irrigation system plant growth plant height stem diameter leaf area index root shoot ratio and plant dry matter physiological photosynthesis and chlorophyll yield components fruit number fruit mass harvest index and crop yield leaf nutrient composition n p k mg ca cu mn fe zn and na and microbiological aerobic count coliforms and faecal coliforms parameters were measured to assess the potential of these hedms as nutrient sources for hydroponically produced tomatoes the results showed that irrigating the tomatoes with hedm increased harvest index relative to crops irrigated with a commercial hydroponic fertilizer mix tomato plants irrigated with a commercial hydroponic fertilizer mix achieved the highest growth and yield however irrigation with human excreta based sources improved plant physiological performance and leaf nutrient composition compared to crops irrigated with commercial fertilizer mix in terms of microbiological analysis tomatoes harvested from plants treated with hedm recorded the highest population of bacterial count as compared to the commercial hydroponic fertilizer mix these results showed that nutrients derived from human excreta can be a good source of nutrients for hydroponically grown tomatoes moreover this practice can effectively address the challenges of human waste disposal while at the same time providing the much needed resources for increased food production through urban agriculture however further research on the effect of heavy metals pathogens on tomato fruit quality is still needed for the adaptation of wastewater as nutrients sources for hydroponically grown tomatoes keywords urban agriculture fertilizer wastewater hydroponic system tomato 1 introduction the use of human excreta derived materials hedm for agricultural crop production has been encouraged as an ecological sanitation approach to promoting closed loop flows of resources such as nutrients from sanitation to agricultural systems this approach seeks to address the shortcomings of sanitation and food production systems by creating a paradigm shift on how human waste is perceived and managed human excreta contains most of the nutrients required for plant growth and is partially being viewed as a resource not a waste to be discarded the majority of the macronutrients are found in the urine fraction with the contribution of about 80 of nitrogen and 45 of phosphorus jönsson et al 2005 the nitrogen contained in urine is mainly in the form of ammonium with 85 100 of it being plant available as in chemical fertilizers due to its ionic form jönsson et al 2000 recycling the nutrients contained in human excreta as fertilizers for crop production can help reduce the energy and chemical costs associated with wastewater treatment likewise this can reduce the environmental burden caused by the use of non renewable resources for the production of synthetic fertilizers many studies have demonstrated the suitability and benefits of using human excreta derived materials as potential nutrients on arable land adeoluwa and cofie 2012 anderson 2015 krause and rotter 2018 this is more evident through the establishment of the decentralised system through which nutrient recovery and wastewater treatment are provided maure et al 2006 wohlsager et al 2010 if properly managed decentralised wastewater treatment systems dewats offer opportunities for the treatment of wastewater close to the source of its generation to a quality that can be discharged into local water sources and reused for agriculture without negative effects on health and environment gutterer et al 2009 the basic technical treatment of the system consists of three steps namely primary treatment sedimentation and floatation secondary treatment usually suspended bed reactors anaerobic baffled reactors and fixed bed anaerobic filters and tertiary treatment sub surface flow filters and polishing ponds the anaerobic baffle reactor abr is efficient for the removal of organic materials and suspended solids from domestic wastewater however effluents treated with this process have a high concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus accompanied by a high level of pathogenic organisms which are partially reduced during the treatment process collivignarelli et al 1990 using partially treated or raw wastewater for irrigation of agricultural crops is associated with the transfer of pathogens which may cause serious illness and other related health risks when used for human consumption dickin et al 2016 as a result control measures that can help minimize the risk of contamination of crops when domestic wastewater is used for irrigation and fertilization need to be selected and managed accordingly the selection of appropriate methods of wastewater treatment along with some control of its use and quality is reported to have the ability of minimising the health and environmental problems related to the agricultural reuse of domestic wastewater lubello et al 2004 another approach used to maximize nutrient removal and recovery is the separate collection of urine using source separation toilets such as urine diversion toilets udts these toilets enable the collection of waste components separately by allowing the collection of urine in a front end bowl and feaces in the rear ended bowl beal et al 2008 münch and dahm 2009 several studies have indicated that out of all the nutrients in municipal wastewater about 80 of n and 50 of p originates from urine making human urine a good source of fertilizer langergraber and muellegger 2005 ammonia is a volatile gas that exists in chemical equilibrium with the ammonium ion the equilibrium is ph dependent and higher ph values promote ammonia formation and thus volatilization by microbiologically transforming half of the ammonium ions into nitrate ions essentially forming ammonium nitrate solution the ammonia can be stabilized in solution this solution is basically concentrated 20 fold in an evaporator to produce a concentrated urine derived fertilizer nitrified urine concentrate nuc integrating wastewater treatment systems with plant growth systems that can allow continuous use of wastewater is one promising solution that can increase the adoption of domestic wastewater reuse this can be achieved by developing sanitation technologies for the recovery of nutrients that can be used for growing crops while at the same time providing solutions to the problems of water scarcities nutrient depletion and waste disposal wastewater hydroponic system is a concept formulated through an approach that integrates wastewater treatment and hydroponic crop production norström et al 2003 in wastewater hydroponic system nutrients which are recovered or generated through the biological breakdown of domestic organic wastes are absorbed by plants grown in a hydroponic culture system the hydroponic system component acts as a biofilter in which the nutrient rich effluents are taken up by the plants to produce biomass thus generating wastewater with a negligible amount of nitrogen and phosphorus that can be safely disposed to the environment tomato plant is mostly produced hydroponically and requires a significant amount of nutrients particularly nitrogen phosphorus potassium and calcium for crop growth and yield in hedms nitrogen phosphorus and potassium are found in high amounts compared to other elements schouw et al 2002 the fertilizer value of human urine n p k is reported to be 18 2 5 linden 1997 and the ratio for urine mixed with flush water can be 15 1 3 1 of n p k s respectively palmquist and jönsson 2004 although p n and k n ratios in urine based fertilizers are relatively lower compared to synthetic fertilizers the ionic form of both phosphorus and potassium makes it readily available for plant absorption upon application kirchmann and peterson 1995 this study aims to evaluate the effect of effluents from anaerobic baffled reactor and nitrified urine concentrate on growth and yield of hydroponically grown tomatoes 2 materials and methods 2 1 nutrient sources 2 1 1 decentralised wastewater treatment system dewats effluents the dewats effluent used for this experiment was sourced from a decentralised wastewater treatment system which is a demonstration plant situated at ethekwini municipality in durban south africa 29 46 25 648 e 30 58 28 329 s the system serves 80 households which are connected by one sewer system around newlands mashu and collects wastewater from washbasins showers kitchen sinks laundry and toilets wastes the wastewater used for this study was first treated in the plant which encompasses a sequence of a primary settling chamber anaerobic baffled reactor abr and a secondary anaerobic filter the effluent from the anaerobic baffled reactor was collected into a tank and used as a nutrient source influent and effluent wastewater samples were collected on a weekly and fortnight basis from the hydroponic treatment systems depending throughout the growing season for the purpose of characterization and performance evaluation the following parameters were determined based on standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater dissolved oxygen do ammonium nh4 n and nitrate no3 n total phosphorus po4 3 total suspended solids content tss and the levels of biochemical oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod temperatures and ph were measured on site during sample collection using handheld portable water quality measuring instruments digital thermometer wt 1 and ph meter cp 105 the efﬁciency of pollutant removal in the wastewater treatment plant were assessed on the basis of environmental protection agency epa regulations the samples were stored in a freezer at 20 c and later sent to talbot laboratories pty ltd for analysis physicochemical characteristics of the nutrient solutions used for this study wastewater abr effluents a mixture of commercial hydroponic fertilizer mix chfm and nutrified urine concentrate nuc are presented in table 1 2 1 2 nitrified urine concentrate nuc nitrified urine concentrate a fertilizer developed by researchers from the vuna valorisation of urine nutrients for africa projects was used for this study nutrients contained in the source separated urine were stabilized by means of biological processes nitrification and distillation whereby the urine is stabilized and concentrated udert and wächter 2012 the liquid was concentrated 20 fold to produce a high nutrient content fertilizer the product is reported to contain comparable amounts of nutrients with most chemical nitrogen fertilizers jönsson et al 2004 to ascertain the chemical composition of the nuc used in this study samples were sent to talbot and talbot laboratories camps drift pietermaritzburg south africa for analysis and results are also presented in table 1 2 1 3 commercial hydroponic fertilizer mix the commercial hydroponic fertilizer mix was used as an experimental control solution comprised of hygroponic and solu cal sourced from hygrotech pty ltd pietermaritzburg south africa the solution was prepared based on the recommended ratio of 600 g 490 g 1000 l of hygroponic and solu cal respectively from transplanting to first truss and 800 g 620 g from the first truss to harvesting 2 2 experimental details and procedures to investigate the suitability of human excreta for tomato production a hydroponic system designed to run three nutrients streams namely decentralized wastewater treatment system dewats effluents nitrified urine concentrate nuc commercial hydroponic fertilizer mix chfm was used each hydroponic system consisted of 150 l reservoir units and the nutrient solution for each system was contained in a 100 l container stacked on the ground at the foot of each system two weeks old tomato seedlings of cv monica were chosen for this study because they are a short season determinate type of breed the seedlings were transplanted into 30 cm polyethylene pots and the entire hydroponic system was set up in a greenhouse at newlands mashu research station under ethekwini municipality kwazulu natal south africa a pressure pump supplied the nutrient solution up through a 20 m irrigation line along the length of the benches were the pots were placed a 20 cm drip irrigation emitters 2 l h were placed and irrigation was performed at six intervals of 5 min duration daily using a timer snyder 2020 the study was arranged using a complete randomised design with three replications giving fifteen experimental units of five plants each tomato plants were irrigated with a commercial hydroponic fertilizer mix hygroponic and solu cal at the rate of 800 g 620 g 1000 l of water as recommended for hydroponic tomato production for the nuc treatment the commercial fertilizer application rate value was used as a standard as recommended by jönsson et al 2004 who proposed that urine based fertilizers contain equal amounts of nutrients compared to traditional fertilizers the urine nitrogen content was used as the determining factor for the nutrient content of nuc because nitrogen is considered a limiting factor for plant growth and the most dominant nutrient in human urine jönsson et al 2004 no specified application rate was used for the dewats effluent treatment the only effluent from the anaerobic baffled reactor component was used both as nutrient and irrigation source the experiment was allowed to run for 12 weeks before the crop was harvested 2 3 data collection plant height was measured using a measuring tape placed at the base of the stem to the tips of the leaves and stem diameter was measured at harvest using a caliper leaf area index lai was determined using an lai 2200 li 2200 li cor lincolin nebraska usa at harvest by taking five readings per plant one reading above the canopy and four readings below canopy chlorophyll concentration index cci was measured using a portable chlorophyll meter spad 502

to prevent stomatal closure tomato plants were harvested at 12 weeks for all the experimental treatments roots and shoots were separated and weighed for both fresh and dry mass the roots were thoroughly rinsed with distilled water plant materials were dried in an oven at 60 c to constant weight to measure both shoot and root dry weight plant samples were then milled to 1 mm mesh wire for the analysis of shoot macro and micro nutrient the samples were sent to the soil fertility and analytical services laboratory cedara kzn department of agriculture and environmental affairs shoot mineral content were analysed using icp aes for micro and macronutrients rodda et al 2011 yield and yield components number of fruits fruit mass total yield per plant and harvest index were also measured after harvest the harvest index hi was measured by taking the ratio of fruit fresh mass to plant total fresh mass the hi was determined based on fresh mass because hi units are functional to their use as marketable units and tomato plants are marketed mostly on their fresh state 2 4 pathogenic characteristics 2 4 1 bacterial counts sample preparation five green and five red tomatoes were collected from the three different nutrient sources dewats nuc and chfm making a total of 30 tomatoes these were divided in to six batches dewatsr ripe fruit samples from decentralized wastewater treatment system dewatsg green fruit samples from decentralized wastewater treatment system nucr ripe fruit samples from nitrified urine concentrate nucg green fruit sample from nitrified urine concentrate chfmr ripe fruits samples from commercial hydroponic fertilizer mix chfmg green fruit samples from commercial hydroponic fertilizer mix the harvested fruits showed no disease symptoms wounds or any other damages and they were immediately subjected to experimentation after harvest using each batch at a time tomato fruit samples were surface sterilized by submerging them for 30 s in 70 ethanol 30 s in 1 sodium hypochlorite and triple rinsed for 30 s in sterile distilled water thereafter the samples were air dried in a laminar flow cabinet under aseptic conditions and each sample was diced into small pieces and placed in a sterile glass beaker using a flame sterilized scalpel the sample was blended using a stick blender logik ac 230 v 50hz 200 w kb until it was homogenised 2 4

macconkey mac and eosin methylene blue emb agar selective for aerobic count coliforms and faecal coliforms respectively with three replications each the plates were then incubated at 37 c for 48 h and the number of colonies formed at each plate was counted and recorded this was converted to colony forming units per ml cfu ml morphologically different colonies on na mac and emb were selected and subcultured on to fresh na using the 3 way streak method this was to better differentiate between the cultures and to ensure that the selected cultures were morphological different the plates were then appropriately labelled and incubated at 37 c for 48 h thereafter 30 glycerol was prepared by diluting 30 ml absolute glycerol in 70 ml distilled water the solution was autoclaved at 121 c for 15 min using a micropipette 1 ml aliquot was transferred into sterile 2 ml eppendorf tubes thereafter a loopful of culture was transferred from a pure culture plate into and eppendorf tube containing sterile 30 glycerol 2 5 statistical analyses data collected from measured variables were subjected to analysis of variance anova using genstat version 18 vsn international hemel hempstead uk treatment

nutrient composition of hydroponically produced tomatoes both human excreta derived materials dewats effluent and nuc reported low crop growth and yield compared to the chemical hydroponic fertilizer mix tables 2 and 3 plants treated with nuc produced lower shoot dry mass 13 90 g and root dry mass 4 70 g compared to the plants treated with chfm with the mass of 44 56 g and 12 23 g respectively biomass of plants treated with dewats effluents was also lower with shoot dry mass recording 5 90 g while the root dry mass was 6 13 g however the root shoot ratio was higher in the dewats effluents treatment 1 3 compared to the nuc 0 4 and chfm 0 3 treatments plants treated with human excreta derived nutrient sources obtained a lower lai than the chemical hydroponic fertilizer mix nuc treatment showed a higher lai 1 8 than the dewats 1 5 effluents as for shoot nutrient composition significant differences were observed between the three nutrient sources shoots of tomatoes grown in nuc had a high n p cu fe and na content and lower k ca than those grown in dewats effluents and chfm treatments tables 3 and 4 a high concentration of ca content was detected in the shoots of tomato treated with effluents from dewats treatment system compared with nuc and a similar pattern was observed on mg and zn content table 5 as for mineral content in the shoots significant differences p 0 05 were observed between the three nutrient sources treatment shoots of tomatoes grown in nuc had a high n p cu fe and na content and lower ca than those grown in dewats effluents and chfm treatments table 3 however both nuc and dewats treated plants recorded the same level of k which was significantly lower than the chfm treated plants a high rate of ca content was detected in the shoots of tomato treated with effluents from dewats treatment system compared with nuc and a similar pattern was observed on mg and zn content table 4 3 2 plant chlorophyll content index and photosynthetic rate as affected by nutrient sources significantly different response in plant physiological performance was observed in the present study as shown in fig 1 plants treated with dewats effluents had a high photosynthetic rate 22 76 μmol co2 m 2 s 1 which was comparable to the plants in the control treatment 22 40 μmol co2 m 2 s 1 on the other hand nuc treated plants had the lowest photosynthetic rate 14 46 μmol co2 m 2 s 1 the chlorophyll content index cci of the plants was significantly different among the three nutrients sources plants treated with nuc reported the highest cci 46 64 followed by the plants treated with commercial hydroponic mix 37 84 with dewats effluents treated plants recording the lowest cci 25 49 3 3 comparing the effect of dewats effluents nuc and chemical hydroponic fertilizer mix on yield and yield component parameters fig 2 indicates crop yield and yield components variables fruit mass fruit number harvest index and yield among the nutrient sources there were significant differences in fruit mass fruit number harvest index and yield across the treatments the chfm showed the highest fruit mass 108 g plant 1 fruit number 7 4 fruit plant 1 and yield 408 46 g plant 1 as compared with nuc and dewats effluents in contrast tomato plants treated with dewats effluents attained higher harvest index 0 68 than plants treated with nuc 0 51 and chfm 0 50 among the plants treated with human excreta nutrient sources the dewats effluents showed higher fruit mass harvest index and yield compared to nuc treatment 3 4 pathogen concentration on the fruits of hydroponically grown tomatoes quantification of total aerobic mesophiles total and faecal coliforms are the most important microorganisms used to assess when raw or treated wastewater is used to irrigate agricultural crops ottoson et al 2005 the impact of nutrient sources on the abundance of aerobic count total coliforms and faecal coliforms on tomato fruits at harvest was evaluated table 5 there were no significant p 0 05 differences in the abundance of aerobic count enumerated in green fruits among the treatments total coliforms and faecal coliforms were never detected for all the treatment samples except for nuc where insignificant amount were enumerated the only effect of nutrients sources on pathogenic bacteria in the fruits was found on the red fruit with high microbial load enumerated in fruits harvested from dewats treated plants compared to the other two treatments fruits harvested from dewats treatment enumerated the majority of the selected pathogenic bacteria and their frequency was comparable with the red fruit nuc treated plants showed reduced frequency and population of bacteria in the fruits for both green and red fruits the microbial load between chfm and nuc treatments were not significantly p 0 05 different for the both unripe ad ripened fruits 3 5 principal component and correlation analysis the principal component analysis was conducted to visualize the association between growth physiological yield and mineral content parameters under different nutrient sources fig 3 principal components pc 1 and pc 2 accounted for 92 of total variability among the tested parameters under different sources of nutrients pc 1 and pc 2 accounted for 57 and 35 of the total variation respectively among the nutrient sources used for this experiment dewats effluents treatment was differentiated by high photosynthetic rate root shoot ratio harvest index ca and zn nuc treatment was differentiated by high chlorophyll content index n p mn fe and na content while chfm was characterized by high shoot and root dry matter stem diameter plant height leaf area index fruit number yield and k content fig 3 4 discussion the study evaluated the use of effluents from anaerobic baffled reactor and nitrified urine concentrate as alternative nutrient sources for hydroponic production of tomatoes generally plant growth performance physiology yield and yield components of tomato plants were significantly higher in plants treated with chfm which was used as a control along with dewats effluents and nuc one reason for the observed differences in the control treatment is that the fertilizer mix used was commercially formulated to meet the nutrient requirement of tomato plants grown in a hydroponic system meanwhile the nutrients from hedms dewats effluents and nuc were not adjusted to meet the crop requirements of tomato for the dewats effluents treated plants only wastewater collected from the sewer system was used as nutrient sources whereas for the nuc treatment only nitrogen content of the fertilizer was used as a determinant for the application rate using the commercial fertilizer mix as a benchmark the use of nitrogen content as a determining factor for application rate was based on the recommendations made by jönsson et al 2004 who suggested that human urine s nitrogen content is the same as the one contained in the chemical fertilizer consequently these resulted in plants treated with commercial fertilizer mix to have a higher growth response compared to those from human excreta derived materials the reported decrease in plant growth and dry matter production on plants treated with dewats effluents compared to the other nutrients sources can be attributed to its poor supply for macronutrients n p and k which are essential for plant growth and development this was demonstrated by the lower concentration of these nutrients in the shoots of tomato plants treated with this nutrient source in addition the low chlorophyll content reported on the plants treated with this nutrient source is also indicative of low nutrient supply for the dewats effluents especially nitrogen since chlorophyll content is also used as a physiological determinant for nitrogen status of plants bojović and marković 2009 the use of chlorophyll content as a measure of nitrogen content is as a result of its critical role on the synthesis of photosynthetic proteins demotes mainard et al 2008 in addition the observed high root shoot ratio of plants treated with dewats effluents compared to chfm and nuc treated plants was also an indication for the effect of low nitrogen concentration on plant growth performance a lot of research has established that limited nitrogen in plants tends to produce more roots relative to shoots as a way of adaptation to environmental stress nacry et al 2013 agren and franklin 2003 based on the current findings these results revealed that using dewats effluents as a nutrient source exposed the plants to nutrient stress particularly n p k the main reason for poor nutrient supply is the fact that the amount of macro and micronutrients contained in wastewater is unstable they may be in excess or deficient thus limiting for plant growth almuktar et al 2015 on the other hand plants treated with this nutrient source reported a high photosynthetic rate fruit mass and harvest index the increase in fruit mass is associated with the low number of fruits per tree observed from this study this eliminated competition among fruits in terms of light water and nutrients thus increasing fruit size these results suggest that if dewats effluent is to be recommended for the production of tomatoes using the hydroponic system nutrients contained in the effluents need to be adjusted and supplemented to meet the crop s nutrient requirements contrary to dewats effluents plants treated with nuc reported improved growth performances in terms of shoot dry matter leaf area index and chlorophyll content the direct increase can be attributed to the high concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus contained in the nuc fertilizer which are necessary for plant growth and development these results corroborate those of bohdziewicz et al 2015 who reported a high chlorophyll content in onion plants irrigated with fermented urine the increase in chlorophyll content for plants treated with human urine is associated with the high nitrogen content of human urine jönsson et al 2004 however in this study plants treated with this fertilizer reported lower rates of photosynthesis as well as yield compared to the plants treated with dewats effluents and chfm the reduction in yield performance can be related to the formation of very dark green and weakened plants which further resulted in the development of bottom end rot ber as observed in this study low concentration of calcium is known as a possible secondary factor in the development of ber and this is caused by high n ca mg ca and k ca ratios in a nutrient solution for hydroponically produced tomatoes pavadikovic et al 2010 under this condition plants preferably take up nitrogen potassium and magnesium instead of calcium reducing the quality of tomatoes and yet increasing the risk of ber among the plant nutrients excess nitrogen particularly ammonium is known to be the major contributor of ber as a result of antagonistic interactions that exist for nutrient uptake taylor and locascio 2007 similar observations were found for this study in which the nuc fertilizer had a higher nh4 ca 1 234 and k ca 1 100 ratios which increased the incidence of ber yield reduction for the nuc treated plants this was further demonstrated by the high concentration of nitrogen and low concentration of calcium magnesium and potassium on tomato shoots treated with nuc compared to dewats effluents and commercial hydroponic mix moreover calcium ions are known to be less mobile within the plant vascular system therefore their limited supply in soil nutrient solution results in reduced uptake by plants barrientos priego et al 2016 the poor performance of photosynthetic rate on nuc treated plants might be the result of concentration dilution effect which results when mineral nutrient concentration increases at a faster rate than dry matter accumulation riedell 2010 the plant used more of its energy reserves on nutrient absorption than carbohydrates assimilation gill et al 2011 a similar pattern was observed in the current results in which plants from the nuc had lower dry matter production and high concentration of shoot nitrogen and phosphorus paralleled to chfm treated plants which produced higher dry matter compared to shoot nitrogen concentration plants treated with dewats effluents and nuc accumulated higher concentration of na in the shoots than plants treated with chfm the na content for human excreta derived nutrient sources may be one of the reasons which resulted in reduced plant growth due to na toxicity tester and davenport 2003 previous studies on the salinity effect of na demonstrated the dominance of na for many plant species as a reason for ion specific damage during salt stress tavakkoli et al 2010 toxicity of na affects plant metabolic processes through its ability to compete with k binding sites and crops grown under such conditions may suffer both the effect of na toxicity and low k concentration munns and tester 2008 in addition a higher concentration of na inhibits the acquisition and distribution of essential nutrients such as k ca2 and no3 maathuis 2014 in the present study the high level of sodium ion might be the cause for the low crop productivity of plants treated with these nutrient sources these results showed that the use of domestic wastewater effluent dewats for the irrigation of hydroponically grown tomatoes presents high risks of pathogen contamination contrasting results were found by oyama et al 2005 where the use of hydroponically grown tomatoes reduced the level of faecal coliforms by 73 aerobic counts showed to have dominance over faecal coliform and coliforms and their strains were detected in all the treatments however the source of infection could not be entirely established since only samples from the fruits were taken for analysis future studies need to consider sampling from the source which includes soil growth medium irrigation water leaves and the edible parts of the plants to establish the source of infection 5 conclusion the use of nitrified urine concentrates and effluents from anaerobic baffle reactor as a nutrient and water source for hydroponic tomato production can be an alternative for domestic wastewater treatment this process presents some beneficial effects on fruit growth and yield thus under dewats effluents treatment plant height photosynthetic rate fruit mass harvest index and nutrient uptake mg 2 ca 2 zn2 and fe 2 were improved compared to the control treatment plants treated with nitrified urine concentrate showed a significant increase in chlorophyll content and nutrient uptake n p cu2 mn 2 zn2 and fe 2 this study presents a new opportunity for hydroponic tomato production through the use of dewats effluent from anaerobic wastewater treatment system and human urine from nitrification and distillation process the symptoms of nitrogen deficiency on plants treated with dewats effluents is indicative that tomato plants can be used as a suitable crop for agricultural wastewater use because most of the nutrient is used by the plants for biomass production however the main setback of the proposed alternatives is the effect of these nutrient sources on yield and the presence of pathogens in this sense precaution needs to be taken when dewats effluents and nuc are used for hydroponic tomato production further clarification on the phytotoxic element accumulation dynamics inside the plant organs should be deeply investigated thus further research that will focus on nutrient balances and maximization of these nutrient sources for optimum hydroponic tomato production is required the understanding of the processes that affect nutrient transformation and availability to plants such as nutrient retention time nitrification and the role of temperature ec and ph needs to be further investigated most importantly the effect of nutrient toxicity heavy metals and pharmaceuticals on the edible parts of tomatoes is also required declaration of competing interest the authors declare

rhodes and samaras 1994 water management in the greenhouse production demands constant irrigation for water supply and can be used for yield quality control water stress has a strong effect upon the accumulation of capsaicinoids in c annuum fruits which is the result of competition between biosynthesis of capsaicinoids and other phenylpropanoid metabolites estrada et al 1999 the capsaicinoids in hot pepper fruit are becoming increasingly important to many industries including food e g preparing hot sauce cosmetic e g preventing hair loss shampoo and pharmaceutical industries e g muscle pain relief creams consequently there is a need for identifying production management practices as well as hot pepper cultivars to maximize capsaicinoid production an increase in capsaicinoid production in hot peppers can be accomplished by selecting varieties with high capsaicinoid content and improving production practices with increasing pressure on natural resources water availability for irrigation in agriculture may change which affects crops cultivation especially for those crops sensitive to soil water deficit therefore methods of such crops production should be improved in this study we investigated the effect of moderate drought stress that can be induced with deficit irrigation on the growth parameters yield and capsaicinoids concentration in two chilies c annuum l and c chinense jacq the two species vary in fruit size and pungency research indicates that plants respond differently on the altered water supply at the same time producers achieve higher prices not only based on yield quantity but also chili quality for which capsaicinoids are particularly important 2 materials and methods two different species of chilies capsicum annuum l var chili as rot c annuum chili as

beginning of may the plants were transplanted into a truncated pyramid shaped pots 25 cm x 25 cm x 20 cm for soil peat substrate klasmann n3 was used 2 7 kg per pot at the start of the experiment each plant was irrigated till saturation the pots were placed on 40 cm x 40 cm distance in a randomized plot 40 plants were in the experiment 10 plants were taken for each treatment 2 3 soil hydraulic characteristics field capacity is a soil water content at which gravitational flow becomes negligible e g assouline and or 2014 and is an important parameter for irrigation sheduling for determination of soil water content at field capacity five pots were filled with substrate and slowly saturated after saturation pots were weighed and put on the percolator and left to drain after outflow from the pot stopped soil volumetric water content was measured 65 4 and taken as the field capacity point for determination of soil water retention properties undisturbed soil samples were then taken from the pots with 250 cm3 probe for evaporation method schindler et al 2010 2015 schindler et al 2017 from the water retention curve van genuchten model hyprop fit software meter ums gmbh germany soil water potential at the field capacity water content was determined 2 4 irrigation treatment plants were irrigated using a drip system one dripper per plant connected to a high pressure pump during experiment soil water tension was monitored by jet fill tensiometers soilmoisture equipment santa barbara us tensiometers were placed at 45 angle so that the tip of the tensiometer was right under the plant in the center of the root system soil volumetric water content was measured with theta probe delta t uk located in the center of the root system soil tension was measured daily irrigation was initiated when soil water tension reached the designated values allowable depletion was 40 kpa for field capacity and 70 kpa for 50 field capacity deficit irrigation this corresponded to soil water content 50 for the field capacity irrigation and soil water content of 20 for deficit irrigation for c chinense jacq naga morich deficit irrigation treatment soil water potential measurements were unavailable and scheduling was based on soil water content measurements in one irrigation ratio 8 mm of water was added for field capacity treatment and 4 mm of water for deficit irrigation 2 5 plant samples 2 5 1 fruit number and weight chilies were harvested 3 times at 25 day intervals c annuum chili as rot was picked about 10 days earlier than c chinense naga morich at every harvesting yield of each individual plant was weighted in g and all fruits were counted chilies were picked only when they had variety specific color red fruits were halved placenta and seeds where removed chili pericarps taken from three fruits acquired from the same plant were lyophilized and ground to a fine powder in a mortar chilled with liquid nitrogen the fine powder samples were stored at 20 c till extraction of individual sugars organic acids total phenolic content capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin 2 5 2 plant width and height for width all experimental plants were measured from one shoot to another shoot using a measuring tape shoots were always chosen so that they were as far from each other as possible height of plants was also measured using a measuring tape plants were measured from the bottom of the steam and all the way to the very top of the plant all parameters were measured in cm 2 5 3 root system weight all over ground plant parts were cut off at the base of the plant pots were than marked and let in a cool storage house to dry out after the peat substrate dried out the pots root system was carefully removed from the pot to obtain the complete root after several washes with water length and fresh and dry root weights were measured to determine the dry weight samples were dried in an oven for 4 days at 55 c roots without peat were weighted using a scale in g 2 6 chemical analysis of fruits 2 6 1 analysis of individual sugars and organic acids individual carbohydrates and organic acids were estimated in lyophilized chili pericarp five repetitions were performed per treatment and each repetition included three fruits from the same plant all three fruits were analyzed together for each analysis 200 mg of dry mass was immersed into 8 ml of double distilled water further extraction was performed as described by slatnar et al 2012 analyses performed using a thermo finnigan surveyor hplc system thermo scientific san jose usa rezex rcm monosaccharide 30 0 78 cm thermo scientific san jose usa column and rezex roa organic acid column 30 0 78 cm phenomenex torrance usa were used for sugar and organic acid analyses instrument settings

et al 2012 the samples of 100 mg were extracted with 3 ml 80 methanol containing 3 v v formic acid in a cooled ultrasonic bath 0 c for 1 h total phenolic content of the extracts was assessed using the folin ciocalteu phenol reagent method singleton et al 1999 six milliliters of twice distilled water and 500 μl of folin ciocalteau reagent were added to 100 μl of the sample extracts and left to stand between 8 s and 8 min at room temperature 1 5 ml sodium carbonate 20 w v and 1 9 ml twice distilled water was than added the extracts were mixed and allowed to stand for 30 min at 40 c before measuring absorbance at 765 nm on a lambda bio 20 uv vis spectrophotometer perkin elmer waltham ma a mixture of water and reagents was used as a blank the total phenolic content was expressed as gallic acid equivalents gae in mg 100 g 1 dry weight dw absorptions were measured in three replications 2 6 3 determination of capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin content the extraction of chili pericarp samples for the determination of capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin was made according to the same protocol as for total phenolic capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin were analyzed on a hplc system equipped with a dad detector set on 284 nm the elution solvents were aqueous 0 1 formic acid in double distilled water a and 0 1 formic acid in acetonitrile b for capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin determination a gemini c18 phenomenex column operated at 25 c was used phenolics were identified by comparing their uv vis spectra and retention times with standards and also confirmed using a mass spectrometer thermo scientific lcq deca xp max with an electrospray interface esi operating in positive ion mode capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin contents were expressed in mg 100 g 1 dw of chili fruits 2 7 statistic analyses for the experiment an analyses of variance of the data was preformed using team r d c 2008 where signiﬁcant treatment effects were found a means comparison test was performed using least signiﬁcant difference comparisons among treatments with a signiﬁcance level of α 0 05 tukey test 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil water conditions soil water content and tension are shown in fig 2 soil water tension for field capacity irrigation was between 4 kpa to 42 kpa for the c annuum l chili as rot soil water content was between 20 and 60 fig 2 for c chinense jacq naga morich soil tension measurements at field capacity were not available but water content was similar to that of c annuum l chili as rot for deficit irrigation treatment soil water tension for the species c annuum l chili as rot was average at 65 kpa maximum at 75 kpa and c chinense jacq naga morich was average at 60 kpa maximum at 70 kpa in deficit irrigation soil water content was between 18 and 22 for c annuum l chili as rot and 20 28 for c chinense jacq naga morich strict regulation of deficit irrigation treatments was necessary to maintain soil tension above the border values otherwise the plants were under too severe drought stress soil water content was inversely proportional to soil water potential kpa if soil water content was low then soil water potential was high and vice versa fig 2 plants under deficit irrigation showed signs of drought stress when soil water tension reached or exceeded 75 kpa wilting of leaves the plants recovered as soon as water was applied this corresponds to the experience of ruiz lau et al 2011 that determined that plants recovered after added water even after severe water stress during the experiment c annuum chili as rot was irrigated with total of 478 4 mm 29 9 l and 201 6 mm 12 6 l of water per plant for field capacity and deficit irrigation respectively c chinense naga morich was irrigated with 392 mm 24 5 l and 164 8 mm 10 3 l of water per plant for field capacity and deficit treatment respectively 3 2 yield and plant parameters water deficit affected plant development and fruit production as statistically significant differences were found for all parameters average yield per plant g average fruit number per plant average plant height cm average plant width cm and average root system mass g for both c annuum chili as rot and c chinense naga morich table 1 in arid region under mulched drip irrigation a soil matric potential threshold range of 30 kpa to 40 kpa at 20 cm depth was recommended for irrigation management of chili pepper liu et al 2012 conversely gutiérrez gómez et al 2018 showed higher water use efficiency for irrigation at 70 kpa on average root system mass of c annuum chili as rot plants irrigated at field capacity had 109 5 g heavier root system mass than the plants at drought stress statistically significant differences were on average root system mass of c chinense naga morich those plants that were irrigated at field capacity had on average 192 6 g heavier root system mass than those at deficit irrigation at both species plant height and width were higher at field capacity treatments a correlation is present between yield number of fruits and plant height and width larger plants have more shoots and form more flowers and a larger leaf area which results in bigger yields due to higher photosynthetic intensity similar results regarding the effects of drought stress on plant growth and yield were reported by phimchan et al 2012 ichwan and suwignyo 2017 and jeeatida et al 2018 both growth and total dry matter accumulation in c chinense were seriously affected by a lack of water in the soil liu et al 2012 but not the fruit mass in our experiment water stress greatly influenced the yield number and fruit mass for c chinense naga morich two irrigation treatments showed statistically significant differences in the average fruit mass per plant c annuum chili as rot had 286 9 g more fruit yield per plant irrigated at field capacity 455 8 g of fruit per plant compared to plants under deficit irrigation 168 9 g of fruit per plant c chinense naga morich irrigated at filed capacity had 134 4 g higher yield per plant compared to plants under deficit irrigation table 1 comparing the average fruit number per plant showed statistically significant differences as c annuum chili as rot had 16 1 g more fruits per plant when irrigated at field capacity compared to deficit irrigation c chinense naga morich had 37 3 g less fruits per plant under deficit irrigation compared to plants irrigated at field capacity fruit number and mass of c annuum chili as rot and c chinense naga morich per picking for the two irrigation treatments are presented in tables 2 and 3 statistically significant differences were present at all treatments differences in yield started to show at the first picking and were increasing throughout the rest of all the yield harvests c chinense naga morich under deficit irrigation exposed to drought stress showed visible reaction to the stress flower dropping which subsequently affected the number of fruits at the 3rd picking 3 3 primary and secondary metabolites c annuum chili as rot had higher concentrations of glucose 13 9 g kg 1 dm fructose 28 2 g kg 1 dm and sucrose 0 4 g kg 1 dm at field capacity irrigation c chinense naga morich had higher concentrations of all three analyzed sugars 16 5 g kg 1 23 g kg 1 and 7 6 g kg 1 dm at field capacity irrigation ichwan and suwignyo 2017 tested the effects of deficit irrigation on several chili species and concluded that deficit irrigation lowers the content of individual and total sugars up to 50 in our experiment the drop was only 8 lower concentrations of sugars come as a drought response and its effect on photosynthetic activity fruits flowers and roots are significant consumers of photosynthetic metabolites such as sugars under drought stress plants are not photosynthetically active consequently sugar levels drop as their consumption is greater than their synthesis also in long lasting stress conditions plants start to transport sugars from fruits flowers and roots to other parts of the plant for cell turgor pressure maintenance and death prevention rosa et al 2009 concentration of citric acid in c annuum chili as rot was 2 g kg 1 dm higher at field capacity irrigation treatment citric acid concentration in c chinense naga morich was only 0 5 g kg 1 dm higher at field capacity irrigation timpa et al 1986 reported that citric acid concentration rises with rising drought stress as it helps overcoming the effects of stress on plants citric acid concentration content rises due to the negative effects of drought on the enzyme responsible for its decomposition el tohamy et al 2013 in our study we got different results as timpa et al 1986 and el tohamy et al 2013 since citric acid concentrations were lower at deficit irrigation treatments c annuum chili as rot fruits at field capacity irrigation had higher concentrations of quinic 215 2 g kg 1 dm shikimic 0 23 g kg 1 dm and fumaric acid 0 19 g kg 1 dm concentration of malic acid 22 9 g kg 1 dm was higher at deficit irrigation concentration of oxalic acid 0 30 g kg 1 dm was similar at both treatments for chili as rot c chinense naga morich under deficit irrigation had higher concentrations of malic 1 1 g kg 1 dm quinic 6 9 g kg 1 dm shikimic 1 3 g kg 1 dm fumaric 0 04 g kg 1 dm and oxalic acid 0 5 g kg 1 dm citric acid content was higher 0 5 g kg 1 dm at field capacity irrigation some studies reported decrease of oxalic acid concentration sariyer and oztokat kuzucu 2019 and quinic shikimic and fumaric acids rahmati et al 2015 at drought stress in presented experiment the measured values of these compounds were higher at deficit irrigation compared to field capacity irrigation the concentration of ascorbic acid in c annuum chili as rot under optimal irrigation was 136 5 mg 100 g 1 dm and under deficit irrigation 113 mg 100 g 1 dm which is 20 less statistically significant differences are present also at our second species at field capacity irrigation the concentration of ascorbic acid was 7 mg higher than at deficit irrigation which is a 10 increase our results are similar to other studies which report a drop in ascorbic acid content in stressed plants sariyer and oztokat kuzucu 2019 c annuum chili as rot under optimal irrigation had 136 5 mg 100 g 1 dm ascorbic acid and 113 mg 100 g 1 dm under deficit irrigation which is 20 less statistical significant differences are present also at our second species at field capacity irrigation the concentration of ascorbic acid was 7 mg higher than at deficit irrigation which is a 10 increase our results are similar to other studies which report a drop in ascorbic acid content in stressed plants sariyer and oztokat kuzucu 2019 total phenolic content tpc in c annuum chili as rot plants irrigated to field capacity was higher for 84 7 mg 1056 mg gae 100 g dm or 13 fig 3 similar results were reported by okunlola et al 2016 where plants from the species c annuum under deficit irrigation had lower total phenolic content c chinense naga morich had 548 8 mg gae 100 g dm lower total phenolic content at deficit irrigation 25 fig 3 which is contradictory to okunlola et al 2016 where no statistical differences were found between optimal and deficit irrigated plants cause for lower tpc is in the activity of phenylalanine ammonia lyase pal phimchan et al 2012 stated that enzyme activity of c chinense plants under deficit irrigation is equal or slightly higher so similar number of phenolic compounds are synthesized in stressful conditions such as drought stress polyphenol oxidase activity increases which accelerates the process of degradation which lowers the amount of certain phenolic compounds since pal enzyme cannot ensure enough building blocks capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin content are given in table 4 capsaicin content of c annuum chili as rot for both irrigation treatments was four times higher than that of dihydrocapsaicin both capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin contents were significantly higher at deficit irrigation the capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin content of the more pungent c chinense naga morich was lower at the at deficit irrigation treatment for 60 942 4 mg 100 g 1 and 150 8 mg 100 g 1 respectively table 4 previous research shows that capsaicinoid content increases under drought stress estrada et al 1999 relating the increase to four key enzymes of the capsaicinoid biosynthesis pathway sung et al 2005 phimchan et al 2012 determined that for more pungent cultivars capsaicinoid content either remains unaffected by the water stress or decreases on average the pungency of c annuum chili as rot pericarp was 1753 shu and 6948 shu at field capacity and deficit irrigation respectively and the pungency of c chinense naga morich pericarp was 481 321 shu and 379 520 shu at field capacity and deficit irrigation respectively 4 conclusions irrigation influenced both quantity and quality of evaluated chili species c annuum chili as rot and c annuum chili as rot had higher yield under field capacity irrigation compared to deficit treatment and grew higher and wider c annuum chili as rot had higher concentration of sucrose glucose fructose citric ascorbic quinic shikimic fumaric acid and total phenolic content at field capacity irrigation levels of malic acid capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin were higher in water stressed plants c chinense naga morich showed larger growth at field capacity irrigation treatment fruits of c chinense naga morich had higher concentrations of all three analysed sugars citric acid ascorbic acid total phenolic content capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin at optimal irrigation regime concentrations of malic quinic shikimic fumaric and oxalic acids were lower at deficit irrigation furthermore deficit irrigation increased pungency of the less pungent of evaluated species c annuum chili as rot was 1753 shu and 6948 shu at field capacity and deficit irrigation respectively whereas the pungency of c chinense naga morich decreased with deficit irrigation and was 481 321 shu and 79 520 shu at field capacity and deficit irrigation respectively recently chili trade is based not only on fruit quantity but considers also quality determined by capsaicin content the latter can be significantly influenced by irrigation as demonstrated with c annuum chili as rot future research should concentrate on other stress elicitors which are difficult to control in practice by the producers irrigation is a measure that producers should have control over as it enables

rhodes and samaras 1994 water management in the greenhouse production demands constant irrigation for water supply and can be used for yield quality control water stress has a strong effect upon the accumulation of capsaicinoids in c annuum fruits which is the result of competition between biosynthesis of capsaicinoids and other phenylpropanoid metabolites estrada et al 1999 the capsaicinoids in hot pepper fruit are becoming increasingly important to many industries including food e g preparing hot sauce cosmetic e g preventing hair loss shampoo and pharmaceutical industries e g muscle pain relief creams consequently there is a need for identifying production management practices as well as hot pepper cultivars to maximize capsaicinoid production an increase in capsaicinoid production in hot peppers can be accomplished by selecting varieties with high capsaicinoid content and improving production practices with increasing pressure on natural resources water availability for irrigation in agriculture may change which affects crops cultivation especially for those crops sensitive to soil water deficit therefore methods of such crops production should be improved in this study we investigated the effect of moderate drought stress that can be induced with deficit irrigation on the growth parameters yield and capsaicinoids concentration in two chilies c annuum l and c chinense jacq the two species vary in fruit size and pungency research indicates that plants respond differently on the altered water supply at the same time producers achieve higher prices not only based on yield quantity but also chili quality for which capsaicinoids are particularly important 2 materials and methods two different species of chilies capsicum annuum l var chili as rot c annuum chili as rot and capsicum chinense jacq var naga morich c chinense naga morich were grown under two different irrigation regimes in a pot experiment plants were placed under controlled conditions in a

the species were sown in february and kept in a greenhouse on around 25 c the plants were transplanted when they developed first three leaves into plastic containers ϕ 8 cm after two months at the beginning of may the plants were transplanted into a truncated pyramid shaped pots 25 cm x 25 cm x 20 cm for soil peat substrate klasmann n3 was used 2 7 kg per pot at the start of the experiment each plant was irrigated till saturation the pots were placed on 40 cm x 40 cm distance in a randomized plot 40 plants were in the experiment 10 plants were taken for each treatment 2 3 soil hydraulic characteristics field capacity is a soil water content at which gravitational flow becomes negligible e g assouline and or 2014 and is an important parameter for irrigation sheduling for determination of soil water content at field capacity five pots were filled with substrate and slowly saturated after saturation pots were weighed and put on the percolator and left to drain after outflow from the pot stopped soil volumetric water content was measured 65 4 and taken as the field capacity point for determination of soil water retention properties undisturbed soil samples were then taken from the pots with 250 cm3 probe for evaporation method schindler et al 2010 2015 schindler et al 2017 from the water retention curve van genuchten model hyprop fit software meter ums gmbh germany soil water potential at the field capacity water content was determined 2 4 irrigation treatment plants were irrigated using a drip system one dripper per plant connected to a high pressure pump during experiment soil water tension was monitored by jet fill tensiometers soilmoisture equipment santa barbara us tensiometers were placed at 45 angle so that the tip of the tensiometer was right under the plant in the center of the root system soil volumetric water content was measured with theta probe delta t uk located in the center of the root system soil tension was measured daily irrigation was initiated when soil water tension reached the designated values allowable depletion was 40 kpa for field capacity and 70 kpa for 50 field capacity deficit irrigation this corresponded to soil water content 50 for the field capacity irrigation and soil water content of 20 for deficit irrigation for c chinense jacq naga morich deficit irrigation treatment soil water potential measurements were unavailable and scheduling was based on soil water content measurements in one irrigation ratio 8 mm of water was added for field capacity treatment and 4 mm of water for deficit irrigation 2 5 plant samples 2 5 1 fruit number and weight chilies were harvested 3 times at 25 day intervals c annuum chili as rot was picked about 10 days earlier than c chinense naga morich at every harvesting yield of each individual plant was weighted in g and all fruits were counted chilies were picked only when they had variety specific color red fruits were halved placenta and seeds where removed chili

the bottom of the steam and all the way to the very top of the plant all parameters were measured in cm 2 5 3 root system weight all over ground plant parts were cut off at the base of the plant pots were than marked and let in a cool storage house to dry out after the peat substrate dried out the pots root system was carefully removed from the pot to obtain the complete root after several washes with water length and fresh and dry root weights were measured to determine the dry weight samples were dried in an oven for 4 days at 55 c roots without peat were weighted using a scale in g 2 6 chemical analysis of fruits 2 6 1 analysis of individual sugars and organic acids individual carbohydrates and organic acids were estimated in lyophilized chili pericarp five repetitions were performed per treatment and each repetition included three fruits from the same plant all three fruits were analyzed together for each analysis 200 mg of dry mass was immersed into 8 ml of double distilled water further extraction was performed as described by slatnar et al 2012 analyses performed using a thermo finnigan surveyor hplc system thermo scientific san jose usa rezex rcm monosaccharide 30 0 78 cm thermo scientific san jose usa column and rezex roa organic acid column 30 0 78 cm phenomenex torrance usa were used for sugar and organic acid analyses instrument settings

folin ciocalteu phenol reagent method singleton et al 1999 six milliliters of twice distilled water and 500 μl of folin ciocalteau reagent were added to 100 μl of the sample extracts and left to stand between 8 s and 8 min at room temperature 1 5 ml sodium carbonate 20 w v and 1 9 ml twice distilled water was than added the extracts were mixed and allowed to stand for 30 min at 40 c before measuring absorbance at 765 nm on a lambda bio 20 uv vis spectrophotometer perkin elmer waltham ma a mixture of water and reagents was used as a blank the total phenolic content was expressed as gallic acid equivalents gae in mg 100 g 1 dry weight dw absorptions were measured in three replications 2 6 3 determination of capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin content the extraction of chili pericarp samples for the determination of capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin was made according to the same protocol as for total phenolic capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin were analyzed on a hplc system equipped with a dad detector set on 284 nm the elution solvents were aqueous 0 1 formic acid in double distilled water a and 0 1 formic acid in acetonitrile b for capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin determination a

statistic analyses for the experiment an analyses of variance of the data was preformed using team r d c 2008 where signiﬁcant treatment effects were found a means comparison test was performed using least signiﬁcant difference comparisons among treatments with a signiﬁcance level of α 0 05 tukey test 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil water conditions soil water content and tension are shown in fig 2 soil water tension for field capacity irrigation was between 4 kpa to 42 kpa for the c annuum l chili as rot soil water content was between 20 and 60 fig 2 for c chinense jacq naga morich soil tension measurements at field capacity were not available but water content was similar to that of c annuum l chili as rot for deficit irrigation treatment soil water tension for the species c annuum l chili as rot was average at 65 kpa maximum at 75 kpa and c chinense jacq naga morich was average at 60 kpa maximum at 70 kpa in deficit irrigation soil water content was between 18 and 22 for c annuum l chili as rot and 20 28 for c chinense jacq naga morich strict regulation of deficit irrigation treatments was necessary to maintain soil tension above the border values otherwise the plants were under too severe drought stress soil water content was inversely proportional to soil water potential kpa if soil water content was low then soil water potential was high and vice versa fig 2 plants under deficit irrigation showed signs of drought stress when soil water tension reached or exceeded 75 kpa wilting of leaves the plants recovered as soon as water was applied this corresponds to the experience of ruiz lau et al 2011 that determined that plants recovered after added water even after severe water stress during the experiment c annuum chili as rot was irrigated with total of 478 4 mm 29 9 l and 201 6 mm 12 6 l of water per plant for field capacity and deficit irrigation respectively c chinense naga morich was irrigated with 392 mm 24 5 l and 164 8 mm 10 3 l of water per plant for field capacity and deficit treatment respectively 3 2 yield and plant parameters water deficit affected plant development and fruit production as statistically significant differences were found for all parameters average yield per plant g average fruit number per plant average plant height cm average plant width cm and average root system mass g for both c annuum chili as rot and c chinense naga morich table 1 in arid region under mulched drip irrigation a soil matric potential threshold range of 30 kpa to 40 kpa at 20 cm depth was recommended for irrigation management of chili pepper liu et al 2012 conversely gutiérrez gómez et al 2018 showed higher water use efficiency for irrigation at 70 kpa on average root system mass of c annuum chili as rot plants irrigated at field capacity had 109 5 g heavier root system mass than the plants at drought stress statistically significant differences were on average root system mass of c chinense naga morich those plants that were irrigated at field capacity had on average 192 6 g heavier root system mass than those at deficit irrigation at both species plant height and width were higher at field capacity treatments a correlation is present between yield number of fruits and plant height and width larger plants have more shoots and form more flowers and a larger leaf area which results in bigger yields due to higher photosynthetic intensity similar results regarding the effects of drought stress on plant growth and yield were reported by phimchan et al 2012 ichwan and suwignyo 2017 and jeeatida et al 2018 both growth and total dry matter accumulation in c chinense were seriously affected by a lack of water in the soil liu et al 2012 but not the fruit mass in our experiment water stress greatly influenced the yield number and fruit mass for c chinense naga morich two irrigation treatments showed statistically significant differences in the average fruit mass per plant c annuum chili as rot had 286 9 g more fruit yield per plant irrigated at field capacity 455 8 g of fruit per plant compared to plants under deficit irrigation 168 9 g of fruit per plant c chinense naga morich irrigated at filed capacity had 134 4 g higher yield per plant compared to plants under deficit irrigation table 1 comparing the average fruit number per plant showed statistically significant differences as c annuum chili as rot had 16 1 g more fruits per plant when irrigated at field capacity compared to deficit irrigation c chinense naga morich had 37 3 g less fruits per plant under deficit irrigation compared to plants irrigated at field capacity fruit number and mass of c annuum chili as rot and c chinense naga morich per picking for the two irrigation treatments are presented in tables 2 and 3 statistically significant differences were present at all treatments differences in yield started to show at the first picking and were increasing throughout the rest of all the yield harvests c chinense naga morich under deficit irrigation exposed to drought stress showed visible reaction to the stress flower dropping which subsequently affected the number of fruits at the 3rd picking 3 3 primary and secondary metabolites c annuum chili as rot had higher concentrations of glucose 13 9 g kg 1 dm fructose 28 2 g kg 1 dm and sucrose 0 4 g kg 1 dm at field capacity irrigation c chinense naga morich had higher concentrations of all three analyzed sugars 16 5 g kg 1 23 g kg 1 and 7 6 g kg 1 dm at field capacity irrigation ichwan and suwignyo 2017 tested the effects of deficit irrigation on several chili species and concluded that deficit irrigation lowers the content of individual and total sugars up to 50 in our experiment the drop was only 8 lower concentrations of sugars come as a drought response and its effect on photosynthetic activity fruits flowers and roots are significant consumers of photosynthetic metabolites such as sugars under drought stress plants are not photosynthetically active consequently sugar levels drop as their consumption is greater than their synthesis also in long lasting stress conditions plants start to transport sugars from fruits flowers and roots to other parts of the plant for cell turgor pressure maintenance and death prevention rosa et al 2009 concentration of citric acid in c annuum chili as rot was 2 g kg 1 dm higher at field capacity irrigation treatment citric acid concentration in c chinense naga morich was only 0 5 g kg 1 dm higher at field capacity irrigation timpa et al 1986 reported that citric acid concentration rises with rising drought stress as it helps overcoming the effects of stress on plants citric acid concentration content rises due to the negative effects of drought on the enzyme responsible for its decomposition el tohamy et al 2013 in our study we got different results as timpa et al 1986 and el tohamy et al 2013 since citric acid concentrations were lower at deficit irrigation treatments c annuum chili as rot fruits at field capacity irrigation had higher concentrations of quinic 215 2 g kg 1 dm shikimic 0 23 g kg 1 dm and fumaric acid 0 19 g kg 1 dm concentration of malic acid 22 9 g kg 1 dm was higher at deficit irrigation concentration of oxalic acid 0 30 g kg 1 dm was similar at both treatments for chili as rot c chinense naga morich under deficit irrigation had higher concentrations of malic 1 1 g kg 1 dm quinic 6 9 g kg 1 dm shikimic 1 3 g kg 1 dm fumaric 0 04 g kg 1 dm and oxalic acid 0 5 g kg 1 dm citric acid content was higher 0 5 g kg 1 dm at field capacity irrigation some studies reported decrease of oxalic acid concentration sariyer and oztokat kuzucu 2019 and quinic shikimic and fumaric acids rahmati et al 2015 at drought stress in presented experiment the measured values of these compounds were higher at deficit irrigation compared to field capacity irrigation the concentration of ascorbic acid in c annuum chili as rot under optimal irrigation was 136 5 mg 100 g 1 dm and under deficit irrigation 113 mg 100 g 1 dm which is 20 less statistically significant differences are present also at our second species at field capacity irrigation the concentration of ascorbic acid was 7 mg higher than at deficit irrigation which is a 10 increase our results are similar to other studies which report a drop in ascorbic acid content in stressed plants sariyer and oztokat kuzucu 2019 c annuum chili as rot under optimal irrigation had 136 5 mg 100 g 1 dm ascorbic acid and 113 mg 100 g 1 dm under deficit irrigation which is 20 less statistical significant differences are present also at our second species at field capacity irrigation the concentration of ascorbic acid was 7 mg higher than at deficit irrigation which is a 10 increase our results are similar to other studies which report a drop in ascorbic acid content in stressed plants sariyer and oztokat kuzucu 2019 total phenolic content tpc in c annuum chili as rot plants irrigated to field capacity was higher for 84 7 mg 1056 mg gae 100 g dm or 13 fig 3 similar results were reported by okunlola et al 2016 where plants from the species c annuum under deficit irrigation had lower total phenolic content c chinense naga morich had 548 8 mg gae 100 g dm lower total phenolic content at deficit irrigation 25 fig 3 which is contradictory to okunlola et al 2016 where no statistical differences were found between optimal and deficit irrigated plants cause for lower tpc is in the activity of phenylalanine ammonia lyase pal phimchan et al 2012 stated that enzyme activity of c chinense plants under deficit irrigation is equal or slightly higher so similar number of phenolic compounds are synthesized in stressful conditions such as drought stress polyphenol oxidase activity increases which accelerates the process of degradation which lowers the amount of certain phenolic compounds since pal enzyme cannot ensure enough building blocks capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin content are given in table 4 capsaicin content of c annuum chili as rot for both irrigation treatments was four times higher than that of dihydrocapsaicin both capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin contents were significantly higher at deficit irrigation the capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin content of the more pungent c chinense naga morich was lower at the at deficit irrigation treatment for 60 942 4 mg 100 g 1 and 150 8 mg 100 g 1 respectively table 4 previous research shows that capsaicinoid content increases under drought stress estrada et al 1999 relating the increase to four key enzymes of the capsaicinoid biosynthesis pathway sung et al 2005 phimchan et al 2012 determined that for more pungent cultivars capsaicinoid content either remains unaffected by the water stress or decreases on average the pungency of c annuum chili as rot pericarp was 1753 shu and 6948 shu at field capacity and deficit irrigation respectively and the pungency of c chinense naga morich pericarp was 481 321 shu and 379 520 shu at field capacity and deficit irrigation respectively 4 conclusions irrigation influenced both quantity and quality of evaluated chili species c annuum chili as rot and c annuum chili as rot had higher yield under field capacity irrigation compared to deficit treatment and grew higher and wider c annuum chili as rot had higher concentration of sucrose glucose fructose citric ascorbic quinic shikimic fumaric acid and total phenolic content at field capacity irrigation levels of malic acid capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin were higher in water stressed plants c chinense naga morich showed larger growth at field capacity irrigation treatment fruits of c chinense naga morich had higher concentrations of all three analysed sugars citric acid ascorbic acid total phenolic content capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin at optimal irrigation regime concentrations of malic quinic shikimic fumaric and oxalic acids were lower at deficit irrigation furthermore deficit irrigation increased pungency of the less pungent of evaluated species c annuum chili as rot was 1753 shu and 6948 shu at field capacity and deficit irrigation respectively whereas the pungency of c chinense naga morich decreased with deficit irrigation and was 481 321 shu and 79 520 shu at field capacity and deficit irrigation respectively recently chili trade is based not only on fruit quantity but considers also quality determined by capsaicin content the latter can be significantly influenced by irrigation as demonstrated with c annuum chili as rot future research should concentrate on other stress elicitors which are difficult to control in practice by the producers irrigation is a measure that producers should have control over as it enables

10638,the main aim of turfgrass fertilization is to maintain high turf quality and obtain proper turf colour fertigation has been recognized as the best fertilization method for proper turfgrass nutrition and for minimizing nitrogen leaching the aim of this study was to determine the optimum fertilizer rate and frequency for obtaining high quality turfgrass and minimizing nutrient losses using a fertigation system lysimeter experiment was conducted on perennial ryegrass and kentucky bluegrass mixture in 2016 2018 three different fertigation rate treatments were applied 60 120 and 240 kg n ha 1 npk fertigation was applied at three intervals 2 4 and 8 days between fertigation dbf a control treatment with granular fertilizers ctr was also applied the following turfgrass parameters were scored leaf texture overall appearance turf cover and turfgrass colour additionally colour was measured using a spectrophotometer the colour parameters were expressed using the cielab colour system leached water samples were taken every two weeks during the vegetation period the contents of the available forms of selected macro and microelements n p k mg ca na zn cu mn and fe were determined the fertigation parameters nutrient rate and interval between fertigation significantly affected the contents in leachate of most nutrients and metals except those of n nh4 na and zn fertigation resulted in significantly lower n no3 losses in comparison with those under ctr higher rates of nutrients in fertigation solution resulted in increased n no3 content in leachate the same effect was observed for p mg k ca and cu the fertigation interval only affected p losses the lowest p content in leachate was observed in the 2dbf treatment and the p content in leachate increased as the intervals increased the fertigation interval did not affect the leaching of any other nutrient however a significant difference in leachate content was observed between the ctr with granular fertilizers and fertigation this effect was observed for n no3 k ca mn and cu a significantly higher content of all these nutrients was observed in leachate from the ctr treatment than in that from the fertigation treatments fertigation resulted in darker grass leaves in comparison with those under ctr higher fertigation rates resulted in darker leaves with higher green hue content than those at lower rates there were no differences in colour hue in turfgrass fertigated at different time intervals turfgrass quality was affected by the fertigation rate and interval this effect was significant for overall appearance turf colour and leaf texture but not for turf cover the highest mean quality score was obtained at 240npk and the lowest was obtained at 60npk the optimal fertigation parameters for reduced nutrient losses and high turfgrass quality were calculated to be the 60npk fertigation level at a fertigation interval of 4 4 days keywords turfgrass fertigation quality colour nutrient leaching 1 introduction a typical soil proﬁle under sport turfgrass contains a sand enriched rootzone lying on a coarse textured sand or gravel two standards are widely used in natural turf sport field construction american society for testing and materials astm standard f2396 04 standard guide for construction of high performance sand based rootzones for sports fields and din 18035 4 german national standard sports grounds sports turf areas according to the astm standard sand materials should have no more than a 30 very coarse sand and gravel fraction and no more than a 15 fraction below 0 25 mm in diameter the principal motivation for having high sand content in the rootzones is to resist soil compaction from frequent foot traffic and compaction and to maintain a good aeration state these benefits contradict the main function of the rootzone which is to store water and nutrients mccoy and mccoy 2009 barton and colmer 2006 the main aim of turfgrass fertilization is to maintain high turf density and obtain proper colour without promoting excess top growth to achieve this goal the fertilization programme should be matched to the growth characteristics of the turfgrass n should be applied at a rate and frequency that matches turfgrass demand fertilizers should be applied when the turfgrass is actively growing in order to minimize n leaching chen et al 2018a the n rate applied to produce high quality turfgrass varies depending upon the species and it varies from 100 to 300 kg n ha 1 year 1 petrovic 1990 barton and colmer 2006 martin del campo et al 2019 chen et al 2018a concerns have been raised for decades that such high amounts of n must certainly result in considerable losses especially via leaching of inorganic n n applied during fertilization can either be taken up by turfgrass denitrified in soil and volatilized to gaseous n by soil microbes or be immobilized into the soil organic matter petrovic 1990 n not involved in these processes is likely to be leached nitrate leaching has long been emphasized as the primary route of n loss from turf n leaching can degrade surface water and groundwater resulting in eutrophication acidification and non potable water supplies chen et al 2018b high n rates can not only cause eutrophication but also increase the emissions of greenhouse and ozone depleting gases i e nox nh3 barton and colmer 2006 groenveld et al 2019 because sport turfgrass generally requires regular irrigation and fertilizer application n leaching is a growing problem the total loss of nutrients especially n supplied as conventional fertilizers in annual crops is estimated to be from 30 to 50 jarosiewicz and tomaszewska 2003 according to barton and colmer 2006 annual n leaching rates for turfgrass range from 0 to 160 kg n ha 1 and represent up to 30 of the fertilizer applied with n leaching can be reduced by ensuring that n is applied at a rate that the soil plant system is able to assimilate carpenter et al 1998 to date two practices have been applied in turf management to reduce n leaching from the rootzone of turfgrass they are slow release fertilizers and a process called spoon feeding carrow 1997 slow release fertilizers provide a gradual nutrient supply over a long period of time which improves the efficiency of the usage of n fertilizer the use of slow release fertilizers in agriculture is usually limited to turfgrass zhang et al 1998 and ornamental crops fernández escobar et al 2004 the second method for reducing n leaching is using a specific type of fertilization management called spoon feeding spoon feeding has become the standard means of fertilizing sand based greens and overcoming the shortcomings of their nutrient holding capacity nikolai et al 2000 fertigation is a method of fertilizer application in which fertilizer is usually incorporated within the irrigation system fertigation has been recognized as the best fertilization method for stabilizing turfgrass nitrogen nutrition and minimizing nitrogen leaching the main advantages of this application technique are the uniform distribution of the fertilizer minimal nutrient leaching and easy control of the turfgrass colour and growth rate bar yosef 1999 with fertigation compaction due to equipment travel is eliminated additionally because heavy spreader equipment is not needed equipment costs are drastically lowered bar yosef 1999 playán and faci 1997 the aforementioned methods are environmentally friendly since they prevent soluble nutrients from leaching below the root zone however in everyday practice turfgrass managers often use n application rates that are above the recommended levels which create problems related to the salinity nitrogen interaction especially for warm season grasses pompeiano et al 2014 fertigation rates that are higher than the crop needs cause nitrate leaching and may lead to water contamination bawatharani et al 2004 oenema et al 2005 lv et al 2019 which is also accompanied by an increased soil concentration of nitrate castellanos et al 2013 this situation will likely arise in shallow soils and semi arid conditions prevail during the crop season eilers et al 2007 field experiments have been conducted to understand the mechanisms involved in the movement and transformation of various nitrogen forms and to improve fertigation strategies li et al 2004 rajput and patel 2006 mathematical models have also been developed to improve fertigation management by predicting nutrient assimilation by plants and their movement in soil hydrus 2d has been used extensively for evaluating short term nitrogen fertigation strategies and the effects of soil hydraulic properties soil layering dripper discharge rates irrigation frequency and timing of nutrient applications on wetting patterns and solute distribution gardenas et al 2005 ajdary et al 2007 patel and rajput 2008 ravikumar et al 2011 mmolawa and or 2003 developed a semi analytical model for predicting the movement of nitrates under plant uptake conditions although there have been developments in fertilizer application technology the problem of nutrient losses has still not been solved satisfactorily it is extremely difficult to combine environmental protection economic rationality and high quality turf maintenance the specific texture of soil in the rootzone is also an important factor in coarse textured soils it is extremely difficult to minimize n leaching because of the high hydraulic conductivity and low water retention and cation exchange capacities barton and colmer 2006 the aim of this study was to determine the optimum fertilizer rate and schedule using a fertigation system to obtain high quality turfgrass with minimal nutrient losses it is hypothesised that i turfgrass quality depends not only on the fertilization level but also on the schedule of nutrient application and that ii nutrient leaching can be minimized without a significant deterioration in turfgrass quality 2 methods 2 1 experimental design and treatments experiment was conducted at the experimental station of department of agricultural and environmental chemistry university of

according to the national turfgrass evaluation programme national turfgrass evaluation programme inc and the united states department of agriculture usda beard 1973 the following turfgrass parameters were evaluated leaf texture overall appearance turf cover and turfgrass colour all these parameters were used to calculate the mean score of the turfgrass the lowest score 1 included factors such as broad leaves very poor turf quality low turf density and light green turf colour the highest score 9 indicates thin leaves outstanding turf quality maximum density and dark green turf colour scoring was performed throughout 2016 2017 and 2018 scoring and measurements were carried out monthly from april to november during the period of the experiment 2 3 colour measurements the leaf colour was measured using a konica minolta cm600d spectrophotometer konica minolta inc japan the transmittance of the visible spectrum 380 720 nm was measured at a wavelength interval of 10 nm the spectrophotometer had a diameter viewing area of 11 mm and a 10 observer angle three measurements were collected at three separate locations on the surface of each pot in areas free of any noticeable colour defects these readings were averaged and the colour parameters were saved the colour parameters were expressed using the commission internationale de l eclairage cielab colour system relative to the d65 illuminant standard commission internationale de l eclairage cie 1978 in this three dimensional colour space the three axes are l a and b the axis l is a measure of lightness with white at 100 and black at 0 the axes a and b are measures of the red green and yellow blue chromatic coordinates respectively a positive a or b represents a red or yellow shade respectively and a negative a or b represents a green or blue shade respectively the total colour difference δe was also calculated eq 1 1 δ e δ l 2 δ a 2 δ b 2 where δl δa and δb are the mathematical differences between the l a and b values of the fertigated turfgrass and the control turfgrass with granular fertilizer ctr 2 4 chemical analysis leached subsurface water samples were taken every two weeks during the vegetation period samples were kept in a refrigerator at 4 c and the analyses were performed within 24 h of collection the contents of the available forms of selected macro and microelements p k mg ca na zn cu mn and fe was determined after extraction with a 1 mol dm 3 nh4no3 solution for 24 h on a rotating mixer using a soil solution ratio of 1 25 gondek 2006 the mineral form of nitrogen n nh4 and n no3 in the soil material was extracted with a solution of 1 alk so4 2 12 h2o in the extracts the reduction of the n no3 mixture of metallic iron and zinc was determined using the nitrogen distillation method for the kjeltec 1026 tecator system ii apparatus foss hilleroed denmark the contents of the analysed elements in the obtained extracts were assessed using the icp aes method on an optima 7300dv perkin elmer wellesley united states oleszczuk et al 2007 the soil reference material agromat ag 2 scp science was associated with each analysed series 2 5 statistics an anova for a randomized design was performed using the statistical software package statistica v 13 3 statsoft inc tulsa ok usa to evaluate the significance of the different fertigation parameters on the nutrient losses and turfgrass parameters tables 2 and 3 the data were checked for the normality of the distribution using the shapiro wilk test the homogeneity of variance was checked using levene s test means were compared using a bonferroni test with a level of significance of p 0 05 a regression analysis was carried out to describe the relationship between the leached nutrients and the fertigation parameters to estimate the fertigation parameters for the best turfgrass quality together with reduced environmental impact an optimization problem was formulated the solver tool in excel microsoft excel with a non linear model was applied to solve this optimization problem 3 results 3 1 nutrient leaching the analysis of variance showed that fertigation parameters nutrient rates and intervals between fertigation significantly affected the content in leachate of most nutrients and metals except n nh4 na and zn table 4 different amount of nutrient and metal content in leachate was also observed in particular year of the trial fig 2 the n no3 content in the leachate solution was 16 94 mg dm 3 in 2016 it decreased in 2017 to 14 73 mg dm 3 and increased up to 24 42 mg dm 3 in 2018 similar relationship was also observed for k p and mn some metals na mg ca fe cu and zn content in leachate increased in subsequent years however amount of n nh4 in leachate presented opposite effect the total amount of leached n was significantly affected by the fertigation rate and fertigation interval however this effect was only observed for n no3 the n nh4 content in the leachate solution did not depend on the fertigation system it was connected with low n nh4 content in relation to n no3 the average amount of leached n no3 18 59 mg dm 3 was almost ten times higher than that of n nh4 2 12 mg dm 3 fertigation resulted in significantly lower n no3 losses 17 40 mg dm 3 on average in comparison with the losses from standard fertilization using granular fertilizers ctr 22 15 mg dm 3 as expected higher rates of nutrients in fertigation solution resulted in increased n no3 content in the leachate the lowest n no3 content in leachate 13 77 mg dm 3 was found in the 60npk treatment whereas this value was 24 33 mg dm 3 in the 240npk treatment the same effect was observed for p mg k ca and cu the content of other elements n nh4 na mn fe and zn in leachate were not affected by the amount of fertilizer applied during fertigation fertigation intervals only affected p losses through leaching the lowest p content in leachate was observed for the short fertigation interval 2dbf 1 07 mg dm 3 this value increased to 1 28 mg dm 3 when fertigation was applied at an 8 day interval 8dbf fertigation intervals did not affect the leaching of any other nutrient however a significant difference in leachate content was observed between ctr with granular fertilizers and fertigation notwithstanding the interval this effect was observed for n no3 k ca mn and cu for all these nutrients a significantly higher content in leachate was observed under the ctr treatment some nutrients in leachate e g n nh4 na mg fe and zn remained at the same level in all interval treatments including ctr moreover for two elements p and cu fertigation intervals interacted with the fertigation rate at lower fertigation rates 60npk and 120npk significant differences in the p and cu content of leachate between ctr and fertigation treatments were observed when the highest fertigation rate was applied 240npk these differences were not significant the regression models for fertigation parameters and n no3 and p are presented in figs 3 and 4 3 2 turfgrass colour the reflectance spectrum of the leaves after the different fertigation regimes is presented in fig 5 the changes between the different fertigation parameters appeared mainly in the wavelengths ranging from 540 to 680 nm this wavelength range corresponds with the colours green yellow orange and red in that order the fertigation rate and interval parameters significantly affected the cielab colour parameters however the interaction between these factors was not statistically significant table 2 the only significant difference in the l colour parameter was observed between ctr 42 74 and other fertigated treatments 2dbf 4dbf and 8dbf 43 92 on average table 5 this means that fertigation resulted in darker grass leaves than those under fertilization using granular fertilizers this effect was also seen in the δl parameter calculated as the difference between fertigated treatments and ctr the lowest δl value was observed for 2dbf 1 01 which means that the l value of 2db was more similar to that of ctr than that of the other treatments with longer fertigation intervals fertigation also resulted in higher green hue content a 3 99 on average in turfgrass leaves while ctr was characterized by an a value of 4 75 table 5 there were no differences in red green hue between turfgrass fertigated at different time intervals however some differences in the a parameter among fertigation intervals were not reflected in significant differences in δa but only in δe the lowest value of δe 0 87 was determined for 2dbf and was significantly lower than that for 8dbf 1 14 fertigation rates also resulted only in differences in the l and a colour parameters higher fertigation rates resulted in darker leaves than those at lower rates 240npk at 43 47 vs 60npk at 44 04 the fertilization rate also affected the red green hue the lowest value of the a colour parameter was observed for 240npk 4 50 whereas the highest red hue content was observed for 60npk 3 59 this difference was also reflected in the differential δl and δe colour parameters these parameters showed that turfgrass with higher fertigation rates 240npk presented a more pronounced difference from ctr than turfgrass with lower fertigation rates 60npk 3 3 turfgrass quality assessment turfgrass quality was affected by the fertigation rate and interval parameters table 2 however this effect was significant for overall appearance turf colour and leaf texture but not for turf cover the highest overall appearance score 7 11 was observed in the ctr treatment granular fertilizers table 6 long fertigation intervals 4dbf and 8dbf had the same overall appearance level while 2dbf resulted in a significantly lower value of 6 67 a strong effect on overall appearance was obtained when different fertigation rates were applied the overall appearance score increased from 6 17 at 60npk to 7 42 at 240npk a similar effect was also observed for turf colour only the ctr treatment resulted in a significantly higher turf colour score 7 50 all fertigation treatments resulted in the same colour score the highest turf colour score for different fertigation rates was observed for the 240npk treatment lower fertigation rates resulted in decreases in turf colour assessment to 6 29 at 60npk leaf texture was affected only by the fertigation rate in contrast to the overall appearance and turf colour features the leaf texture was better for turfgrass at lower fertigation rates 6 87 at 60npk and 6 00 at 240npk the mean score was calculated from the overall appearance turf colour and leaf texture fertigation intervals affected the mean turf score however the only significant differences were between ctr and the dbf treatments more pronounced differences were found between different fertigation rates the highest mean score was obtained for 240npk 7 17 and the lowest for 60npk 6 52 the regression model of the fertigation parameters and the mean turfgrass quality score is presented in fig 6 3 4 optimization of fertigation two regression models were used for the optimization of fertigation parameters one for the relationship between n no3 content in leachate and fertigation parameters eq 2 and one for the relationship between the mean score of turfgrass and fertigation parameters eq 3 only n no3 content was considered as a measure of nutrient losses during turfgrass fertigation n no3 is one of the most important nutrients from an environmental point of view as it makes up a high proportion of all nutrient leachate 2 m s 5 1358 0

nonlinear grg optimization procedure were a level of fertigation of 60npk and a fertigation interval of 4 4 days 4 discussion 4 1 turfgrass fertilization and nutrient losses nutrient and metal leaching from investigated turfgrass changes during three year experiment higher n no3 k and p losses in 2016 than 2017 could be ascribed to lower biomass of grass in the first initial year after turf establishing and lower nutrient uptake chen et al 2018 observed that n applied at a constant rate leads to high rates of n loss during the early development of a turf when the capacity for biotic nutrient retention via plants and microbes is relatively small the highest nutrient content in leachate in the third year of the experiment was result of mineralization process of organic matter accumulated in older turf this effect was reported by shi et al 2006 in research with turfgrass at golf courses this research indicated that the different fertigation parameters e g fertigation interval and rate have significant environmental impacts moreover fertigation parameters also influenced the quality of turfgrass according to li et al 2019 fertilization management should comply with a 4r principle the 4r principles relate to applying fertilizer at the right rate right time and right place and from the right source however this general rule should be translated into specific technologies and management practices the schedule of fertilizer applications needed to achieve quality turfgrass and minimize n leaching varies with fertilizer type for more water soluble n fertilizers lower rates and more frequent applications in comparison with those of slow release fertilizers should be used to minimize n leaching chen et al 2018a fertigation is recognized as one of the recommended methods of fertilization for environmental protection and economic reasons fertigation can significantly decrease the n leaching losses lv et al 2019 thus it prevents ecosystem eutrophication this beneficial effect for the environment is the result of effective nutrient use by plants fertigation also resulted in greater nitrate n accumulation in the top 0 60 cm soil layer in comparison with that from conventional top dressing fertilization shareef et al 2019 groenveld et al 2019 reported that nitrogen use efficiency dropped from approximately 80 to 55 with an increased fertigation rate this relationship has exponential characteristics and led to rapid drainage and gaseous emissions of nitrogen in the current research the nutrient losses increased at higher fertigation rates however this relationship was close to linear and was not exponential a fertigation system can maximize crop water and nutrient uptake while minimizing nutrient leaching this result is stronger in sandy soil than in clay soil wu et al 2019 fertigation could be the best alternative for water limited environments and sandy soil the presented results confirm this hypothesis for sandy soil the fertilization system resulted in lower nutrient losses compared with those from conventional granular fertilizers ctr according to wu et al 2019 maize fertigation increased yield and water and nutrient use efficiency a similar effect was confirmed by groenveld et al 2019 in research with vegetables on the other hand vilarrasa nogué et al 2019 in research with olive orchards observed that increasing n fertigation tended to increase oil production without increasing emissions turfgrass appears to be more susceptible to n leaching during site establishment applying n fertilizers at rates and frequencies that match turfgrass requirements can also decrease n leaching from turfgrass barton and colmer 2006 snyder et al 1980 reported that approximately 50 more n was leached from the conventionally fertilized plots than from those plots receiving n by fertigation current research confirms this statement it was found that it is possible to reduce the amount of nutrients applied without a deterioration of turfgrass quality in turfgrass management clippings strongly influence the fertilization rate and amount of nutrient leaching in the present study clippings were removed after cutting if clippings are removed more nutrients are usually required to obtain the same level of turfgrass quality kauer et al 2008 stated that plants take up approximately 5 50 of the n from decaying clippings during the growing season however kauer et al 2009 explained that the effect of the clippings on yield is caused by moisture conditions during the year the influence of the clippings is significant in those years when moisture conditions are favourable for plant growth moreover the effect of clippings on the turfgrass yield usually appeared when larger quantities of clippings were returned according to chen et al 2018 returning clippings can reduce n fertilizer requirements by 30 75 4 2 turfgrass quality response to fertigation turfgrass colour is widely considered to be the most important turf quality parameter the turf colour is determined by the dose of nitrogen iron and manganese in soils and by the plant s water uptake and genetic structure as well as various other factors for this reason almost all turf genera and varieties contain a unique green tone which changes at certain limits yilmaz 2019 this variability makes it difficult to compare the results obtained in research on different regions climates soil conditions and grass species it could be expected that reducing n leaching and maintaining n within the rooting zone will also benefit turfgrass quality according to khandan mirkohi et al 2016 the turfgrass colour and quality depend not only on fertilization levels but also on the interaction of fertilization and irrigation they also observed that the reduction in the nitrogen supply and the irrigation regime resulted in a reduction in turfgrass vegetative growth while quality traits were not affected negatively the current research has noted that the highest turf colour score was for 240npk the highest fertilization rate treatment lower rates resulted in decreases in the turf colour assessment chen et al 2018 observed that high applications of water soluble fertilizers initially tend to provide higher turfgrass growth and colour however these results are often short lived and increase n leaching 4 3 optimum fertigation scheduling in turfgrass management there is a problem with over fertilization this problem arises from the main purpose of turfgrass management practices which is turfgrass quality rather than grass yield this research provides a recommendation for fertigation parameters to obtain the best turfgrass quality with reduced nutrient losses it is difficult to compare the current results with those of other studies because there is a lack of research concerning the optimal parameters for turfgrass fertilization in the present study the optimum nitrogen rate was determined to be 60 kg n ha 1 but with a 4 4 day fertigation frequency higher rates resulted in better turfgrass quality e g colour leaf texture and overall appearance the best result was obtained at 240 kg n ha 1 however higher nutrient rates resulted in strongly increased nutrient losses other studies concerning the optimal level of nutrient application usually refer to conventional granular fertilizers in these studies recommended fertilization rates are usually significantly higher than those for fertigation systems knot et al 2017 reported in a study with urban turfgrass that it is possible to reduce the dose of n fertilization without diminishing the colour and quality of the lawn they did not find significant differences between 50 and 100 kg n ha 1 fertilization rates according to their research a further reduction is possible in a management system with clipping returning however this effect might depend on crop species climate and soil characteristics the best results for nitrogen phosphorus and potassium used in turfgrasses were reported by different authors in a wide range of doses according to the results obtained by yilmaz 2019 in a warm climate in loamy soil 300 kg n ha 1 is recommended for both environmental to prevent soil and water pollution and economic reasons yilmaz 2019 observed that turf quality rapidly increased in the range of low fertilization levels at the higher fertilization level this effect slowly disappears and above 400 kg n ha 1 turf quality starts to decrease salman and avcioglu 2010 found a very high nitrogen rate of 500 kg n ha 1 to be the optimum rate for turfgrass in a mediterranean climate on loamy soil 5 conclusions the fertigation parameters nutrient rate and intervals between fertigation significantly affected the content in leachate of most nutrients and metals except n nh4 na and zn fertigation resulted in significantly lower n no3 losses in comparison with the losses under ctr higher rates of nutrients in fertigation solution resulted in increasing n no3 content in leachate the same effect was observed for p mg k ca and cu fertigation intervals affected only p losses the lowest p content in leachate was observed in the 2dbf treatment and p losses increased at longer intervals fertigation intervals did not affect the leaching of any other nutrient however a significant difference in leachate content was observed between ctr with granular fertilizers and fertigation this effect was observed for n no3 k ca mn and cu for all these nutrients a significantly higher content in leachate was observed in the ctr treatment than in fertigation treatments fertigation resulted in darker grass leaves in comparison with those of ctr higher fertigation rates resulted in darker leaves with higher green hue contents than those at lower rates there were no differences in colour hue among turfgrass fertigated at different time intervals turfgrass quality was affected by the fertigation rate and interval parameters this effect was significant for overall appearance turf colour and leaf texture but not for turf cover the highest mean quality score was obtained for 240npk and the lowest was obtained for 60npk the optimal fertigation parameters for reduced nutrient losses and high turfgrass quality were calculated to be the 60npk fertigation level and a fertigation interval of 4 4 days it can be concluded that it is recommended to continue comparative investigations into turfgrass fertigation systems under different climate and soil conditions and with different grass mixtures declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported

10638,the main aim of turfgrass fertilization is to maintain high turf quality and obtain proper turf colour fertigation has been recognized as the best fertilization method for proper turfgrass nutrition and for minimizing nitrogen leaching the aim of this study was to determine the optimum fertilizer rate and frequency for obtaining high quality turfgrass and minimizing nutrient losses using a fertigation system lysimeter experiment was conducted on perennial ryegrass and kentucky bluegrass mixture in 2016 2018 three different fertigation rate treatments were applied 60 120 and 240 kg n ha 1 npk fertigation was applied at three intervals 2 4 and 8 days between fertigation dbf a control treatment with granular fertilizers ctr was also applied the following turfgrass parameters were scored leaf texture overall appearance turf cover and turfgrass colour additionally colour was measured using a spectrophotometer the colour parameters were expressed using the cielab colour system leached water samples were taken every two weeks during the vegetation period the contents of the available forms of selected macro and microelements n p k mg ca na zn cu mn and fe were determined the fertigation parameters nutrient rate and interval between fertigation significantly affected the contents in leachate of most nutrients and metals except those of n nh4 na and zn fertigation resulted in significantly lower n no3 losses in comparison with those under ctr higher rates of nutrients in fertigation solution resulted in increased n no3 content in leachate the same effect was observed for p mg k ca and cu the fertigation interval only affected p losses the lowest p content in leachate was observed in the 2dbf treatment and the p content in leachate increased as the intervals increased the fertigation interval did not affect the leaching of any other nutrient however a significant difference in leachate content was observed between the ctr with granular fertilizers and fertigation this effect was observed for n no3 k ca mn and cu a significantly higher content of all these nutrients was observed in leachate from the ctr treatment than in that from the fertigation treatments fertigation resulted in darker grass leaves in comparison with those under ctr higher fertigation rates resulted in darker leaves with higher green hue content than those at lower rates there were no differences in colour hue in turfgrass fertigated at different time intervals turfgrass quality was affected by the fertigation rate and interval this effect was significant for overall appearance turf colour and leaf texture but not for turf cover the highest mean quality score was obtained at 240npk and the lowest was obtained at 60npk the optimal fertigation parameters for reduced nutrient losses and high turfgrass quality were calculated to be the 60npk fertigation level at a fertigation interval of 4 4 days keywords turfgrass fertigation quality colour nutrient leaching 1 introduction a typical soil proﬁle under sport turfgrass contains a sand enriched rootzone lying on a coarse textured sand or gravel two standards are widely used in natural turf sport field construction american society for testing and materials astm standard f2396 04 standard guide for construction of high performance sand based rootzones for sports fields and din 18035 4 german national standard sports grounds sports turf areas according to the astm standard sand materials should have no more than a 30 very coarse sand and gravel fraction and no more than a 15 fraction below 0 25 mm in diameter the principal motivation for having high sand content in the rootzones is to resist soil compaction from frequent foot traffic and compaction and to maintain a good aeration state these benefits contradict the main function of the rootzone which is to store water and nutrients mccoy and mccoy 2009 barton and colmer 2006 the main aim of turfgrass fertilization is to maintain high turf density and obtain proper colour without promoting excess top growth to achieve this goal the fertilization programme should be matched to the growth characteristics of the turfgrass n should be applied at a rate and frequency that matches turfgrass demand fertilizers should be applied when the turfgrass is actively growing in order to minimize n leaching chen et al 2018a the n rate applied to produce high quality turfgrass varies depending upon the species and it varies from 100 to 300 kg n ha 1 year 1 petrovic 1990 barton and colmer 2006 martin del campo et al 2019 chen et al 2018a concerns have been raised for decades that such high amounts of n must certainly result in considerable losses especially via leaching of inorganic n n applied during fertilization can either be taken up by turfgrass denitrified in soil and volatilized to gaseous n by soil microbes or be immobilized into the soil organic matter petrovic 1990 n not involved in these processes is likely to be leached nitrate leaching has long been emphasized as the primary route of n loss from turf n leaching can degrade surface water and groundwater resulting in eutrophication acidification and non potable water supplies chen et al 2018b high n rates can not only cause eutrophication but also increase the emissions of greenhouse and ozone depleting gases i e nox nh3 barton and colmer 2006 groenveld et al 2019 because sport turfgrass generally requires regular irrigation and fertilizer application n leaching is a growing problem the total loss of nutrients especially n supplied as conventional fertilizers in annual crops is estimated to be from 30 to 50 jarosiewicz and tomaszewska 2003 according to barton and colmer 2006 annual n leaching rates for turfgrass range from 0 to 160 kg n ha 1 and represent up to 30 of the fertilizer applied with n leaching can be reduced by ensuring that n is applied at a rate that the soil plant system is able to assimilate carpenter et al 1998 to date two practices have been applied in turf management to reduce n leaching from the rootzone of turfgrass they are slow release fertilizers and a process called spoon feeding carrow 1997 slow release fertilizers provide a gradual nutrient supply over a long period of time which improves the efficiency of the usage of n fertilizer the use of slow release fertilizers in agriculture is usually limited to turfgrass zhang et al 1998 and ornamental crops fernández escobar et al 2004 the second method for reducing n leaching is using a specific type of fertilization management called spoon feeding spoon feeding has become the standard means of fertilizing sand based greens and overcoming the shortcomings of their nutrient holding capacity nikolai et al 2000 fertigation is a method of fertilizer application in which fertilizer is usually incorporated within the irrigation system fertigation has been recognized as the best fertilization method for stabilizing turfgrass nitrogen nutrition and minimizing nitrogen leaching the main advantages of this application technique are the uniform distribution of the fertilizer minimal nutrient leaching and easy control of the turfgrass colour and growth rate bar yosef 1999 with fertigation compaction due to equipment travel is eliminated additionally because heavy spreader equipment is not needed equipment costs are drastically lowered bar yosef 1999 playán and faci 1997 the aforementioned methods are environmentally friendly since they prevent soluble nutrients from leaching below the root zone however in everyday practice turfgrass managers often use n application rates that are above the recommended levels which create problems related to the salinity nitrogen interaction especially for warm season grasses pompeiano et al 2014 fertigation rates that are higher than the crop needs cause nitrate leaching and may lead to water contamination bawatharani et al 2004 oenema et al 2005 lv et al 2019 which is also accompanied by an increased soil concentration of nitrate castellanos et al 2013 this situation will likely arise in shallow soils and semi arid conditions prevail during the crop season eilers et al 2007 field experiments have been conducted to understand the mechanisms involved in the movement and transformation of various nitrogen forms and to improve fertigation strategies li et al 2004 rajput and patel 2006 mathematical models have also been developed to improve fertigation management by predicting nutrient assimilation by plants and their movement in soil hydrus 2d has been used extensively for evaluating short term nitrogen fertigation strategies and the effects of soil hydraulic properties soil layering dripper discharge rates irrigation frequency and timing of nutrient applications on wetting patterns and solute distribution gardenas et al 2005 ajdary et al 2007 patel and rajput 2008 ravikumar et al 2011 mmolawa and or 2003 developed a semi analytical model for predicting the movement of nitrates under plant uptake conditions although there have been developments in fertilizer application technology the problem of nutrient losses has still not been solved satisfactorily it is extremely difficult to combine environmental protection economic rationality and high quality turf maintenance the specific texture of soil in the rootzone is also an important factor in coarse textured soils it is extremely difficult to minimize n leaching because of the high hydraulic conductivity and low water retention and cation exchange capacities barton and colmer 2006 the aim of this study was to determine the optimum fertilizer rate and schedule using a fertigation system to obtain high quality turfgrass with minimal nutrient losses it is hypothesised that i turfgrass quality depends not only on the fertilization level but also on the schedule of nutrient application and that ii nutrient leaching can be minimized without a significant deterioration in turfgrass quality 2 methods 2 1 experimental design and treatments experiment was conducted at the experimental station of department of agricultural and environmental chemistry university of

conductivity of 0 05 μs cm 1 the turf was cut to a height of 3 5 cm when the turfgrass was 5 5 cm high and the clippings were removed 2 2 visual quality of turfgrass turfgrass quality was evaluated according to the national turfgrass evaluation programme national turfgrass evaluation programme inc and the united states department of agriculture usda beard 1973 the following turfgrass parameters were evaluated leaf texture overall appearance turf cover and turfgrass colour all these parameters were used to calculate the mean score of the turfgrass the lowest score 1 included factors such as broad leaves very poor turf quality low turf density and light green turf colour the highest score 9 indicates thin leaves outstanding turf quality maximum density and dark green turf colour scoring

to the d65 illuminant standard commission internationale de l eclairage cie 1978 in this three dimensional colour space the three axes are l a and b the axis l is a measure of lightness with white at 100 and black at 0 the axes a and b are measures of the red green and yellow blue chromatic coordinates respectively a positive a or b represents a red or yellow shade respectively and a negative a or b represents a green or blue shade respectively the total colour difference δe was also calculated eq 1 1 δ e δ l 2 δ a 2 δ b 2 where δl δa and δb are the mathematical differences between the l a and b values of the fertigated turfgrass and the control turfgrass with granular fertilizer ctr 2 4 chemical analysis leached subsurface water samples were taken every two weeks during the vegetation period samples were kept in a refrigerator at 4 c and the analyses were performed within 24 h of collection the contents of the available forms of selected macro and microelements p k mg ca na zn cu mn and fe was determined after extraction with a 1 mol dm 3 nh4no3 solution for 24 h on a rotating mixer using a soil solution ratio of 1 25 gondek 2006 the mineral form of nitrogen n nh4 and n no3 in the soil material was extracted with a solution of 1 alk so4 2 12 h2o in the extracts the reduction of the n no3 mixture of metallic iron and zinc was determined using the nitrogen distillation method for the kjeltec 1026 tecator system ii apparatus foss hilleroed denmark the contents of the analysed elements in the obtained extracts were assessed using the icp aes method on an optima 7300dv perkin elmer wellesley united states oleszczuk et al 2007 the soil reference material agromat ag 2 scp science was associated with each analysed series 2 5 statistics an anova for a randomized design was performed using the statistical software package statistica v 13 3 statsoft inc tulsa ok usa to evaluate the significance of the different fertigation parameters on the nutrient losses and turfgrass parameters tables 2 and 3 the data were checked for the normality of the distribution using the shapiro wilk test the homogeneity of variance was checked using levene s test means were compared using a bonferroni test with a level of significance of p 0 05 a regression analysis was carried out to describe the relationship between the leached nutrients and the fertigation parameters to estimate the fertigation parameters for the best turfgrass quality together with reduced environmental impact an optimization problem was formulated the solver tool in excel microsoft excel with a non linear model was applied to solve this optimization problem 3 results 3 1 nutrient leaching the analysis of variance showed that fertigation parameters nutrient rates and intervals between fertigation significantly affected the content in leachate of most nutrients and metals except n nh4 na and zn table 4 different amount of nutrient and metal content in leachate was also observed in particular year of the trial fig 2 the n no3 content in the leachate solution was 16 94 mg dm 3 in 2016 it decreased in 2017 to 14 73 mg dm 3 and increased up to 24 42 mg dm 3 in 2018 similar relationship was also observed for k p and mn some metals na mg ca fe cu and zn content in leachate increased in subsequent years however amount of n nh4 in leachate presented opposite effect the total amount of leached n was significantly affected by the fertigation rate and fertigation interval however this effect was only observed for n no3 the n nh4 content in the leachate solution did not depend on the fertigation system it was connected with low n nh4 content in relation to n no3 the average amount of leached n no3 18 59 mg dm 3 was almost ten times higher than that of n nh4 2 12 mg dm 3 fertigation resulted in significantly lower n no3 losses 17 40 mg dm 3 on average in comparison with the losses from standard fertilization using granular fertilizers ctr 22 15 mg dm 3 as expected higher rates of nutrients in fertigation solution resulted in increased n no3 content in the leachate the lowest n no3 content in leachate 13 77 mg dm 3 was found in the 60npk treatment whereas this value was 24 33 mg dm 3 in the 240npk treatment the same effect was observed for p mg k ca and cu the content of other elements n nh4 na mn fe and zn in leachate were not affected by the amount of fertilizer applied during fertigation fertigation intervals only affected p losses through leaching the lowest p content in leachate was observed for the short fertigation interval 2dbf 1 07 mg dm 3 this value increased to 1 28 mg dm 3 when fertigation was applied at an 8 day interval 8dbf fertigation intervals did not affect the leaching of any other nutrient however a significant difference in leachate content was observed between ctr with granular fertilizers and fertigation notwithstanding the interval this effect was observed for n no3 k ca mn and cu for all these nutrients a significantly higher content in leachate was observed under the ctr treatment some nutrients in leachate e g n nh4 na mg fe and zn remained at the same level in all interval treatments including ctr moreover for two elements p and cu fertigation intervals interacted with the fertigation rate at lower fertigation rates 60npk and 120npk significant differences in the p and cu content of leachate between ctr and fertigation treatments were observed when the highest fertigation rate was applied 240npk these differences were not significant the regression models for fertigation parameters and n no3 and p are presented in figs 3 and 4 3 2 turfgrass colour the reflectance spectrum of the leaves after the different fertigation regimes is presented in fig 5 the changes between the different fertigation parameters appeared mainly in the wavelengths ranging from 540 to 680 nm this wavelength range corresponds with the colours green yellow orange and red in that order the fertigation rate and interval parameters significantly affected the cielab colour parameters however the interaction between these factors was not statistically significant table 2 the only significant difference in the l colour parameter was observed between ctr 42 74 and other fertigated treatments 2dbf 4dbf and 8dbf 43 92 on average table 5 this means that fertigation resulted in darker grass leaves than those under fertilization using granular fertilizers this effect was also seen in the δl parameter calculated as the difference between fertigated treatments and ctr the lowest δl value was observed for 2dbf 1 01 which means that the l value of 2db was more similar to that of ctr than that of the other treatments with longer fertigation intervals fertigation also resulted in higher green hue content a 3 99 on average in turfgrass leaves while ctr was characterized by an a value of 4 75 table 5 there were no differences in red green hue between turfgrass fertigated at different time intervals however some differences in the a parameter among fertigation intervals were not reflected in significant differences in δa but only in δe the lowest value of δe 0 87 was determined for 2dbf and was significantly lower than that for 8dbf 1 14 fertigation rates also resulted only in differences in the l and a colour parameters higher fertigation rates resulted in darker leaves than those at lower rates 240npk at 43 47 vs 60npk at 44 04 the fertilization rate also affected the red green hue the lowest value of the a colour parameter was observed for 240npk 4 50 whereas the highest red hue content was observed for 60npk 3 59 this difference was also reflected in the differential δl and δe colour parameters these parameters showed that turfgrass with higher fertigation rates 240npk presented a more pronounced difference from ctr than turfgrass with lower fertigation rates 60npk 3 3 turfgrass quality assessment turfgrass quality was affected by the fertigation rate and interval parameters table 2 however this effect was significant for overall appearance turf colour and leaf texture but not for turf cover the highest overall appearance score 7 11 was observed in the ctr treatment granular fertilizers table 6 long fertigation intervals 4dbf and 8dbf had the same overall appearance level while 2dbf resulted in a significantly lower value of 6 67 a strong effect on overall appearance was obtained when different fertigation rates were applied the overall appearance score increased from 6 17 at 60npk to 7 42 at 240npk a similar effect was also observed for turf colour only the ctr treatment resulted in a significantly higher turf colour score 7 50 all fertigation treatments resulted in the same colour score the highest turf colour score for different fertigation rates was observed for the 240npk treatment lower fertigation rates resulted in decreases in turf colour assessment to 6 29 at 60npk leaf texture was affected only by the fertigation rate in contrast to the overall appearance and turf colour features the leaf texture was better for turfgrass at lower fertigation rates 6 87 at 60npk and 6 00 at 240npk the mean score was calculated from the overall appearance turf colour and leaf texture fertigation intervals affected the mean turf score however the only significant differences were between ctr and the dbf treatments more pronounced differences were found between different fertigation rates the highest mean score was obtained for 240npk 7 17 and the lowest for 60npk 6 52 the regression model of the fertigation parameters and the mean turfgrass quality score is presented in fig 6 3 4 optimization of fertigation two regression models were used for the optimization of fertigation parameters one for the relationship between n no3 content in leachate and fertigation parameters eq 2 and one for the relationship between the mean score of turfgrass and fertigation parameters eq 3 only n no3 content was considered as a measure of nutrient losses during turfgrass fertigation n no3 is one of the most important nutrients from an environmental point of view as it makes up a high proportion of all nutrient leachate 2 m s 5 1358 0

nonlinear grg optimization procedure were a level of fertigation of 60npk and a fertigation interval of 4 4 days 4 discussion 4 1 turfgrass fertilization and nutrient losses nutrient and metal leaching from investigated turfgrass changes during three year experiment higher n no3 k and p losses in 2016 than 2017 could be ascribed to lower biomass of grass in the first initial year after turf establishing and lower nutrient uptake chen et al 2018 observed that n applied at a constant rate leads to high rates of n loss during the early development of a turf when the capacity for biotic nutrient retention via plants and microbes is relatively small the highest nutrient content in leachate in the third year of the experiment was result of mineralization process of organic matter accumulated in older turf this effect was reported by shi et al 2006 in research with turfgrass at golf courses this research indicated that the different fertigation parameters e g fertigation interval and rate have significant environmental impacts moreover fertigation parameters also influenced the quality of turfgrass according to li et al 2019 fertilization management should comply with a 4r principle the 4r principles relate to applying fertilizer at the right rate right time and right place and from the right source however this general rule should be translated into specific technologies and management practices the schedule of fertilizer applications needed to achieve quality turfgrass and minimize n leaching varies with fertilizer type for more water soluble n fertilizers lower rates and more frequent applications in comparison with those of slow release fertilizers should be used to minimize n leaching chen et al 2018a fertigation is recognized as one of the recommended methods of fertilization for environmental protection and economic reasons fertigation can significantly decrease the n leaching losses lv et al 2019 thus it prevents ecosystem eutrophication this beneficial effect for the environment is the result of effective nutrient use by plants fertigation also resulted in greater nitrate n accumulation in the top 0 60 cm soil layer in comparison with that from conventional top dressing fertilization shareef et al 2019 groenveld et al 2019 reported that nitrogen use efficiency dropped from approximately 80 to 55 with an increased fertigation rate this relationship has exponential characteristics and led to rapid drainage and gaseous emissions of nitrogen in the current research the nutrient losses increased at higher fertigation rates however this relationship was close to linear and was not exponential a fertigation system can maximize crop water and nutrient uptake while minimizing nutrient leaching this result is stronger in sandy soil than in clay soil wu et al 2019 fertigation could be the best alternative for water limited environments and sandy soil the presented results confirm this hypothesis for sandy soil the fertilization system resulted in lower nutrient losses compared with those from conventional granular fertilizers ctr according to wu et al 2019 maize fertigation increased yield and water and nutrient use efficiency a similar effect was confirmed by groenveld et al 2019 in research with vegetables on the other hand vilarrasa nogué et al 2019 in research with olive orchards observed that increasing n fertigation tended to increase oil production without increasing emissions turfgrass appears to be more susceptible to n leaching during site establishment applying n fertilizers at rates and frequencies that match turfgrass requirements can also decrease n leaching from turfgrass barton and colmer 2006 snyder et al 1980 reported that approximately 50 more n was leached from the conventionally fertilized plots than from those plots receiving n by fertigation current research confirms this statement it was found that it is possible to reduce the amount of nutrients applied without a deterioration of turfgrass quality in turfgrass management clippings strongly influence the fertilization rate and amount of nutrient leaching in the present study clippings were removed after cutting if clippings are removed more nutrients are usually required to obtain the same level of turfgrass quality kauer et al 2008 stated that plants take up approximately 5 50 of the n from decaying clippings during the growing season however kauer et al 2009 explained that the effect of the clippings on yield is caused by moisture conditions during the year the influence of the clippings is significant in those years when moisture conditions are favourable for plant growth moreover the effect of clippings on the turfgrass yield usually appeared when larger quantities of clippings were returned according to chen et al 2018 returning clippings can reduce n fertilizer requirements by 30 75 4 2 turfgrass quality response to fertigation turfgrass colour is widely considered to be the most important turf quality parameter the turf colour is determined by the dose of nitrogen iron and manganese in soils and by the plant s water uptake and genetic structure as well as various other factors for this reason almost all turf genera and varieties contain a unique green tone which changes at certain limits yilmaz 2019 this variability makes it difficult to compare the results obtained in research on different regions climates soil conditions and grass species it could be expected that reducing n leaching and maintaining n within the rooting zone will also benefit turfgrass quality according to khandan mirkohi et al 2016 the turfgrass colour and quality depend not only on fertilization levels but also on the interaction of fertilization and irrigation they also observed that the reduction in the nitrogen supply and the irrigation regime resulted in a reduction in turfgrass vegetative growth while quality traits were not affected negatively the current research has noted that the highest turf colour score was for 240npk the highest fertilization rate treatment lower rates resulted in decreases in the turf colour assessment chen et al 2018 observed that high applications of water soluble fertilizers initially tend to provide higher turfgrass growth and colour however these results are often short lived and increase n leaching 4 3 optimum fertigation scheduling in turfgrass management there is a problem with over fertilization this problem arises from the main purpose of turfgrass management practices which is turfgrass quality rather than grass yield this research provides a recommendation for fertigation parameters to obtain the best turfgrass quality with reduced nutrient losses it is difficult to compare the current results with those of other studies because there is a lack of research concerning the optimal parameters for turfgrass fertilization in the present study the optimum nitrogen rate was determined to be 60 kg n ha 1 but with a 4 4 day fertigation frequency higher rates resulted in better turfgrass quality e g colour leaf texture and overall appearance the best result was obtained at 240 kg n ha 1 however higher nutrient rates resulted in strongly increased nutrient losses other studies concerning the optimal level of nutrient application usually refer to conventional granular fertilizers in these studies recommended fertilization rates are usually significantly higher than those for fertigation systems knot et al 2017 reported in a study with urban turfgrass that it is possible to reduce the dose of n fertilization without diminishing the colour and quality of the lawn they did not find significant differences between 50 and 100 kg n ha 1 fertilization rates according to their research a further reduction is possible in a management system with clipping returning however this effect might depend on crop species climate and soil characteristics the best results for nitrogen phosphorus and potassium used in turfgrasses were reported by different authors in a wide range of doses according to the results obtained by yilmaz 2019 in a warm climate in loamy soil 300 kg n ha 1 is recommended for both environmental to prevent soil and water pollution and economic reasons yilmaz 2019 observed that turf quality rapidly increased in the range of low fertilization levels at the higher fertilization level this effect slowly disappears and above 400 kg n ha 1 turf quality starts to decrease salman and avcioglu 2010 found a very high nitrogen rate of 500 kg n ha 1 to be the optimum rate for turfgrass in a mediterranean climate on loamy soil 5 conclusions the fertigation parameters nutrient rate and intervals between fertigation significantly affected the content in leachate of most nutrients and metals except n nh4 na and zn fertigation resulted in significantly lower n no3 losses in comparison with the losses under ctr higher rates of nutrients in fertigation solution resulted in increasing n no3 content in leachate the same effect was observed for p mg k ca and cu fertigation intervals affected only p losses the lowest p content in leachate was observed in the 2dbf treatment and p losses increased at longer intervals fertigation intervals did not affect the leaching of any other nutrient however a significant difference in leachate content was observed between ctr with granular fertilizers and fertigation this effect was observed for n no3 k ca mn and cu for all these nutrients a significantly higher content in leachate was observed in the ctr treatment than in fertigation treatments fertigation resulted in darker grass leaves in comparison with those of ctr higher fertigation rates resulted in darker leaves with higher green hue contents than those at lower rates there were no differences in colour hue among turfgrass fertigated at different time intervals turfgrass quality was affected by the fertigation rate and interval parameters this effect was significant for overall appearance turf colour and leaf texture but not for turf cover the highest mean quality score was obtained for 240npk and the lowest was obtained for 60npk the optimal fertigation parameters for reduced nutrient losses and high turfgrass quality were calculated to be the 60npk fertigation level and a fertigation interval of 4 4 days it can be concluded that it is recommended to continue comparative investigations into turfgrass fertigation systems under different climate and soil conditions and with different grass mixtures declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported

10639,the effective management of irrigation water consumption is one of the main countermeasures to combat water shortages this paper introduced an integrated approach to determine the major factors influencing irrigation water consumption in china it combined multiple linear regression and principal component analysis to analyze the relationship between irrigation water consumption and influencing factors and then applied analytic hierarchy process and cluster analysis to analyze the spatial variation in driving factors of irrigation water consumption based on statistical data from the 31 provinces of china from 2000 to 2015 the results showed that irrigation water consumption was positively affected by the planting size the ratio of surface water in water consumption rsw the planting structure the annual et0 ae and the annual average temperature aat in contrast consumption was generally negatively affected by irrigation technique economic development and annual rainfall ar the water consumption structure irrigation technique and planting structure were major influential factors in most provinces of china and there were significant differences in different regions thus regions should be restructured to be studied as subregions for the total consumption of irrigation water central china was mainly affected by the water consumption structure irrigation technique and climatic conditions and north and northwest china were hardly influenced by planting structure northeast southwest and southeastern coastal china were slightly affected by climatic conditions for the per unit area irrigation water consumption central china was mainly affected by the water consumption structure irrigation technique planting size and climatic conditions southwest south east and northeast china were mainly affected by the planting structure and planting size and northwest and north china were mainly influenced by the irrigation technique water consumption structure and planting size keywords irrigation water consumption driving force analysis regression pca model analytic hierarchy process cluster analysis 1 introduction as one of the countries with serious water resource shortages china s economic development and social security have been severely affected by increasingly serious water resource shortages which makes this topic an urgent issue that must be addressed guo and shen 2016 to solve the water crisis problem and achieve the sustainable development of water resources controlling irrigation water consumption is an effective approach because irrigation water consumption accounts for more than 60 of the country s total water consumption prc 2018 kang et al 2017 with improvements in irrigation technology the water productivity of the agricultural sector of china has continuously increased in recent years however the total amount of agricultural water has not declined as expected due to the rebound effect in agricultural water song et al 2018 this scenario means that irrigation water consumption does not simply change with a single factor but is influenced by a combination of factors therefore it is of great practical significance to analyze the driving factors and reveal the main influencing factors of irrigation water consumption numerous studies have analyzed the driving factors of irrigation water consumption and agricultural water use the impact of climate on irrigation water consumption in southern china mo et al 2017 and agricultural water use in northern china lu et al 2018 was studied doungmanee 2016 studied the nexus of agricultural water use and economic development level in 154 countries and found that the quantity of water used for agricultural purposes gradually increased with the income of that country urbanization was found to have a negative influence on agricultural water use in china by yan et al 2015 the effects of climatic and anthropogenic e g crop pattern and changes in cultivation area factors on irrigation water consumption were investigated in the urmia lake river basin taheri et al 2019 these studies indicated that irrigation water consumption was influenced by many factors such as climatic conditions planting structure and economic development level however there are generally uncertainties nonlinearity and space time variability of the impact of these factors even if the same kind of influencing factors e g economic factors dissimilar effects are showed in different regions doungmanee 2016 yan et al 2015 therefore it is necessary to select the driving factors of irrigation water consumption comprehensively and carry out quantitative analysis and spatial distribution analysis on the influencing factors of irrigation water consumption systematically as regards researches of analysis methods many scholars have carried out thorough analyses of irrigation water consumption change mechanisms in different areas using the following methods 1 regression analysis method abu madi 2009 revealed that irrigation water consumption was related to water pricing using a regression model in tulkarm district palestine the relationships between water consumption and agricultural gdp growth water structure and agricultural water saving situations were compared by adopting a multiple linear regression model in zhejiang china xu 2012 ma et al 2012 used information entropy for analysis and simulated the influencing factors by a multiple linear regression model on regional water consumption 2 grey analysis method the correlation between the agricultural water consumption and agricultural output value structure in beijing was quantitatively analyzed by the grey correlation method wang and chuan 2019 3 factor decomposition analysis method the logarithmic mean divisa index lmdi decomposition and stochastic impact by regression on population affluence and technology stirpat were employed to quantify the variation in driving factors in irrigation water demand zhao et al 2014 zou et al 2018 xie and su 2017 4 principal component analysis method principal component analysis was applied to extract the main driving factors affecting changes in irrigation water use efficiency fang et al 2017 and regional water consumption lu et al 2018 studies in various areas have shown that irrigation water consumption has changed in recent years and some studies have drawn conclusions about the main driving factors however there are certain drawbacks associated with the use of the above methods regression analysis method requires large amount of data and is prone to multicollinearity while the result of grey analysis method would be affected by the artificial weights factor decomposition analysis is mainly limited to the decomposition analysis of agricultural water resource change which is difficult to be used in the prediction principal component analysis is mainly used to extract important information and reveal the structure of data which needs to be combined with correlation analysis clustering analysis regression analysis and other methods therefore in order to analyze the numerous driving factors of irrigation water consumption the regression pca model was adopted combining multiple linear regression and principal component analysis pca the regression coefficient of the multiple linear regression model can reflect the difference among the driving factors and the regression model can be used for prediction which has guiding significance in water resources allocation in addition pca can convert the original variables to a few influencing factors that are not related to each other and eliminate multicollinearity in multiple linear regression to further analyze the spatial effect of the influencing factors the analytic hierarchy process ahp and cluster analysis were introduced to comprehensively analyze the influence of various influencing factors which provided guidance for the selection of corresponding water saving methods and efficient allocation policies of water resources in different regions this study is designed 1 to establish a regression pca model that combines principal component analysis with multiple linear regression for 31 provinces in china 2 to evaluate the relationship between irrigation water consumption and the influencing factors and 3 to compare the spatial variation in the influencing factors of irrigation water consumption to provide guidance for practical work such as the specific water supply water use planning and management the main innovation of this paper is to propose a systematic analysis method of driving force for irrigation water consumption and pay attention to the comparative study of regional differences the characteristics of each region will be illuminated to present scientific evidence about macro decision making classification guidance and planning for water resource allocation 2 materials and methodology in this work we proposed a method for driving force analysis of irrigation water consumption using multiple approaches proper irrigation water consumption indexes and driving factor indexes were selected and relative statistical data for 31 provinces in china from 2001 to 2015 were collected to establish the regression pca model to analyze the relationship between irrigation water consumption and its driving factors an analytic hierarchy process was adopted to analyze the relative importance and influence degree of various categories of driving factors then cluster analysis was used to classify the regression coefficients of the driving factors of irrigation water consumption at the provincial scale for spatial variation analysis 2 1 study area and data considering the characteristics of natural geography and human geography this study divided the 31 provinces of china into seven regions based on the natural geographical division of luo 1954 as shown in fig 1 the seven regions included east china north china northeast china central china south china southwest china and northwest china in addition northern china and southern china which were divided by the boundary of the qinling mountains and huaihe river had obvious differences in topography climate and culture making this boundary one of the most important natural geographical divisions in china the relevant data from 2000 to 2015 were collected from the water resources bulletin and statistical yearbooks of 31 provinces in china the china meteorological information center and the china water resources statistical yearbook the irrigation water consumption of 31 provinces was collected from the water resources bulletin the planting area grain yield agricultural product per capita gdp and planting structure were collected from the statistical yearbook the actual irrigation area and water saving irrigation area were collected from the china water resources statistical yearbook the meteorological data were downloaded from the china meteorological information center http data cma cn and the cumulative investment related to the reconstruction and water saving reform of large sized irrigation districts was provided by the china irrigation and drainage development center irrigation water consumption is influenced by many factors such as natural conditions irrigation technology planting size and economic development based on the statistical data from 2000 to 2015 the irrigation water consumption indexes and driving factor indexes were identified the irrigation water consumption indexes included the total consumption of irrigation water tiwc and the per unit area irrigation water consumption piwc the driving factor indexes for irrigation water consumption were divided into 6 categories the index system and the meaning of each driving factor index are shown in table 1 2 2 regression pca model a multiple linear regression model was applied to find the relationship between irrigation water consumption and its driving factors and to determine the influence of each factor on irrigation water consumption in the real world the correlations among the factors will distort the model estimation and make it difficult to driving force analysis in this paper to eliminate the multicollinearity among variables principal component analysis pca which was originally developed by pearson 1901 was introduced and combined with multiple linear regression to form a regression pca model for the driving force analysis of irrigation water consumption pca is an approach for reducing dimensionality that converts a set of correlated features using orthogonal transformation into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables without losing much information the new form of transformation called principal components is sorted from the largest possible variance to the lowest possible variance if we consider a matrix x each of the n rows represents the data of one year s 13 indicators for one province and each of the p columns provides the data of one indicator in 16 years for one province the data matrix x is shown as the following 1 x x 11 x 12 x 1 p x 21 x 22 x 2 p x n 1 x n 2 x n p in matrix x n represents the number of years 16 years and p represents the number of driving factors 13 indicators the principal components were calculated as follows 1 data standardization the original data were standardized as follows 2 x i j x i j x j σ j i 1 2 n j 1 2 p where x j and σ j are the mean and deviation of variable j respectively 2 calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix considering matrix r as the covariance matrix of matrix x the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix r were calculated based on 3 λ e r 0 where λ 1 λ 2 λn are the eigenvalues of matrix r and l 1 l 2 ln are the corresponding eigenvectors 3 calculation of the contribution rate of variance and cumulative variance these variables were calculated as follows 4 e p λ i i 1 n λ i 5 e p j 1 p λ j i 1 n λ i 4 selection of the principal component generally the principal components are extracted from the largest possible variance to the lowest until the contribution rate of the cumulative variance reaches 80 or the eigenvalue is greater than 1 in this study to avoid losing important information the cumulative contribution rate should exceed 90 when determining the number of principal components 5 calculation of the principal component score the score of variable i of principal component j was calculated as follows 6 u i j x i t l j j 1 2 k where k is the number of principal components the full principal component decomposition of x can therefore be given as 7 u x l l l 1 l k using irrigation water consumption as the dependent variable and the extracted principal component as the independent variable a multiple linear regression model was established as follows 8 y i b 0 j 1 k b j x j i ε i i 1 2 n where b0 and bj are the regression coefficients of the model which can be estimated by the least square method the regression coefficients of the original data driving factors can be converted through the principal component score as the influence of dimensionality has been eliminated through data standardization the standardized regression coefficient can be used to measure the degree to which different factors affect irrigation water consumption 2 3 analytic hierarchy process as the driving factors of the same category were not of the same importance when compared with each other the analytic hierarchy process ahp developed by saaty 1977 was adopted to analyze and determine the relative importance of various categories of driving factors and the comprehensive coefficient of various categorical driving factors was calculated in this study the hierarchical structure was divided into two layers the bottom layer was each specific driving factor and the top layer was each categorical driving factor in the same hierarchy the judgment matrix was constructed by pairwise comparison numbers 1 9 and their reciprocals were used as the scale to define the judgment matrix in table 2 considering matrix a as the judgment matrix the factors were sorted by relative weight according to the eigenvector corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue of matrix a in this paper the geometric average method was introduced to solve the weight vector as follows 9 w i j 1 n a i j 1 n i 1 n j 1 n a i j 1 n the consistency of the judgment matrix can be tested as follows 10 c r c i r i where ci is the consistency index and ri is the mean random consistency index which is shown in table 3 when cr 0 10 the consistency of the judgment matrix is acceptable otherwise the judgment matrix should be modified appropriately franek and kresta 2014 ci can be calculated as follows 11 c i λ max n n 1 where λ max represents the maximum eigenvalue of matrix a and n is the number of driving factors included in the same categorical driving factor 2 4 cluster analysis cluster analysis is a multivariate technique used to find groups of objects such that the objects in a group will be similar or related to one another and different from or unrelated to the objects in other groups tan et al 2006 in this paper the k means cluster method was introduced to classify the regression coefficients of the driving factors of irrigation water consumption at the provincial scale for analyzing the spatial variation in the driving factors of irrigation water consumption k means is a nonhierarchical method that seeks to minimize the within class sum of squares k means often begins with an initial guess of the group centroids and then iteratively searches for the solution bible et al 2013 let mj t be the centroid of the j th cluster of period t and d xj mj t denote the euclidean distance between xj and mj t then the objective is to minimize 12 d x i m j t min d x i m j t j 1 2 k i 1 2 n then xj cj depending on which centroid they are close to since the classification of period t has been made new centroids of period t 1 were calculated as follows 13 m j t 1 1 n j i 1 x i c j n j x i j 1 2 k then process it iteratively until 14 m j t 1 m j t ε j 1 2 k where ε represents the maximum permissible error 3 results and discussion 3 1 establishing the regression pca model of irrigation water consumption the extraction results of the principal components and evaluation parameters of the regression pca model of irrigation water consumption in the 31 provinces are shown in table 4 after the principal component analysis the variable space was reduced from 13 original independent variables to 4 5 linearly uncorrelated variables which solved the distortion problem caused by the high correlation observed in previous studies the cumulative contribution rate of the main factor eigenvalues for 31 provinces reached 90 which indicated that the selected principal components covered almost all the information of the indicators when establishing the regression pca model the non significant principal component factors have been removed thus only the significant factors were retained in the model the significance test parameter sig indicates that most regression models pass the significance test α 0 05 except for tiwc of guizhou shaanxi and piwc of beijing anhui shaanxi and qinghai the average adjusted r2 values of the tiwc and piwc regression pca models are 0 725 and 0 649 respectively which indicates that the changes in driving factors can explain most of the irrigation water consumption fluctuation and the tiwc regression pca model fits slightly better than the piwc regression pca model irrigation water consumption is affected by many driving factors such as natural conditions infrastructure economic development and planting size in this paper the regression pca method was used to analyze the main influencing factors of irrigation water consumption at the provincial scale which not only solved the multicollinearity problem among multiple driving factors but also illuminated how driving factors affect irrigation water consumption through regression coefficients however the linear regression model can explain only the linear relationship between the driving factors and irrigation water consumption the time span of the data in this paper is only 16 years and most driving factors are linearly related to irrigation water consumption thus this method is applicable in long term historical data analysis with obvious segmentation phenomena it is necessary to analyze the data by segmenting or selecting other nonlinear methods such as nonlinear regression and bp neural network methods liu et al 2011 sharifi and langari 2017 3 2 driving factor analysis of irrigation water consumption the regression coefficients of the tiwc regression pca model of planting size are shown in fig 2 the average regression coefficients of pa gy and aia in each province are 0 068 0 042 and 0 062 respectively which means that planting size generally has a positive effect on tiwc pa gy and aia reflect the planting size of each province to a certain extent while gy is influenced by many factors such as agricultural technology fertility varieties and water content which makes the contribution of gy on tiwc less than that of pa and aia aia was excluded from the driving factor analysis of piwc because it had been included in the calculation of piwc the average regression coefficients of pa and gy in each province are 0 032 and 0 006 respectively which means that planting size generally has a slightly positive effect on piwc however there are significant differences between the north and the south in which the planting size has a positive contribution in the south and a negative contribution in the north that the relationship between planting size and piwc varies in different regions may be related to the difference in water resources southern china which is rich in water resources mainly plants high water consuming crops such as paddy rice the relatively extensive irrigation management causes a greater water loss in a larger area resulting in a larger piwc crops with less water consumption such as wheat and maize are mainly planted in northern china moreover strict irrigation management in northern china lowers the amount of water loss in a larger area resulting in a smaller piwc feng 2013 indicated that the water efficiency of irrigation in southern provinces was significantly lower than that in northern provinces which was aligned with the results in the current study because rsw was absolutely large in southern china and varied slightly in different years to avoid amplifying the random fluctuations of the standardized driving factors over time rsw was excluded in the analysis of driving factors in provinces whose rsw values exceeded 90 on average this exclusion occurred because it was assumed that the irrigation water consumption in these provinces was hardly affected by rsw the regression coefficients of the tiwc and piwc regression pca models of water consumption structure are shown in fig 3 the average regression coefficients of rsw and rna in each province are 0 055 and 0 172 respectively the increase of rws contributed positively on tiwc in the provinces affected by rsw because the water supply for irrigation water consumption is composed of surface water and groundwater surface water which is not as easily obtained as groundwater cannot be flexibly adjusted based on the irrigation time and the amount required for the growth of the crop a large amount of water resources will be wasted during water transportation with a low irrigation water use efficiency wang and zhao 2008 thus the increase of rsw would lead to a higher irrigation water consumption most provinces in china are negatively affected by rna on tiwc and the influence is greater in southern china than in northern china from the perspective of regional economic development the benefit of water per unit volume of industry is far greater than that of agriculture thus local governments prefer to distribute the limited water resources to industrial development with the development of industry the proportion of non agricultural water use increases and the proportion of agricultural water use decreases under the limited total water resources causing tiwc to decrease the average regression coefficients of piwc of rsw and rna in each province are 0 082 and 0 175 respectively which indicates a similar influence rule consistent with that of the tiwc the regression coefficients of the tiwc and piwc regression pca models of irrigation technique are shown in fig 4 the average regression coefficients of rws of tiwc and piwc in each province are 0 092 and 0 071 respectively which shows that rws has a negative impact on irrigation water consumption in most provinces rws can reflect the water saving irrigation technology level water saving irrigation technology especially community based technologies including canal seepage control low pressure pipe irrigation sprinkler irrigation and micro irrigation technology can reduce the water loss during irrigation and enhance the irrigation water use efficiency and save water blanke et al 2007 however rws may have a positive effect on irrigation water consumption in the period of agricultural expansion when rws is increasing and the agricultural scale is expanding because in the period of agricultural expansion water saving irrigation is developing in the region and the saved irrigation water is used to expand the irrigation area which weakens the water saving effect brought by the improvement of water saving irrigation technology han 2014 this result agreed with the study by batchelor et al 2014 which found that improved efficiency productivity and profitability encouraged farmers to increase the area cropped and or to adopt multiple cropping systems with increased consumptive water use zhang and guo 2016 also determined that the water uses could be increased after improving irrigation efficiency under the condition of a limited water supply and unrestricted irrigable land the regression coefficients of the tiwc and piwc regression pca models of economic development are shown in fig 5 the average regression coefficients of ci ap and pgdp of the regression pca model in each province are 0 004 0 013 and 0 010 respectively for tiwc and 0 046 0 059 and 0 055 respectively for piwc which means that economic development generally has a negative effect on irrigation water consumption however significant differences exist in the influence of economic development on irrigation water consumption in different regions and these differences are related to the stage of agricultural development in the region modern agricultural development in china has been divided into three stages shi et al 2012 1 preliminary implementation stage of agriculture modernization the agricultural development had gradually separated from the traditional agricultural stage characterized by the stagnation of technology and the growth of production mainly relied on the growth of traditional agricultural inputs the extensive application of agricultural technology has obviously promoted agricultural development 2 basic implementation stage of agriculture modernization modernization characteristics were shown in this stage and land productivity labor productivity and resource utilization obviously increased 3 comprehensive implementation stage of agriculture modernization the agricultural economy agricultural society and natural environment entered a stage of coordinated and sustainable development in northwest and southwest china economic development has a positive influence on tiwc and piwc which indicates that the western part is in a transition period from the traditional agricultural stage to the preliminary implementation stage of agricultural modernization abundant water resources are allocated into agricultural production with the rapid development of agriculture and the irrigation technology and irrigation water use efficiency are unqualified resulting in increasing irrigation water consumption economic development has a positive influence on tiwc and a negative influence on piwc in northeast china which is in the preliminary implementation stage of agricultural modernization with developing agriculture and increasing irrigation water in addition the irrigation water use efficiency is improved and piwc is reduced with the wide application of agricultural science and technology there is a slight negative influence from economic development on the tiwc and piwc in central china indicating the transition from the preliminary implementation stage to the basic implementation stage of agricultural modernization the tiwc and piwc are decreased with slowing agricultural growth and improving irrigation water use efficiency the economic development of east and north china has a large negative impact on tiwc and piwc indicating that east and north china are in the basic implementation stage of agricultural modernization in which the irrigation water use efficiency is significantly improved resulting in a significant decline in tiwc and piwc the regression coefficients of the tiwc and piwc regression pca models of planting structure are shown in fig 6 because rpr was absolutely small in northern china and varied slightly in different years in some provinces in southern china to avoid standardized data amplifying the random fluctuations of driving factors over time rpr was excluded in the analysis of driving factors in provinces where the rpr did not reach 10 on average or where the interannual variation was less than 5 considering that the irrigation water consumption in these provinces was hardly affected by rpr the average regression coefficients of the rpr of the regression pca model in each province are 0 119 for tiwc and 0 123 for piwc which indicates that rpr has a great positive effect in most southern provinces as the proportion of high water consumption crops e g paddy rice increases the greater the irrigation water consumption will be kaneko et al 2005 it s worth noting that only prp was selected in this paper to analyze the impact of planting structure on irrigation water consumption that is the planting structure was divided into paddy rice and other upland crops without taking into account the impact of the proportion of different upland crops on irrigation water consumption this is because water used for paddy rice irrigation in china accounts for a large proportion 60 of irrigation water consumption which makes a critical contribution therefore when the method in this paper is applied to other countries or regions it is necessary to select appropriate crops to reflect the planting structure for analysis the regression coefficients of the tiwc and piwc regression pca models of climatic condition are shown in fig 7 the average regression coefficients of ar ae and aat of the regression pca model in each province are 0 092 0 050 and 0 019 respectively for tiwc and 0 072 0 028 and 0 002 respectively for piwc which means a negative influence of ar and a positive influence of ae and aat on tiwc and piwc from the analysis of the water demand mechanism precipitation as an important climatic factor will affect solar radiation air temperature air humidity and soil moisture content thus affecting the evapotranspiration of crops and irrigation water consumption less irrigation water can meet the growth demand of crops by taking advantage of rainfall as a supplementary water source in areas with sufficient and evenly distributed precipitation wang et al 2017 revealed that the irrigation requirement of rice would present a remarkable increase in nanjing and kunshan which are distributed in east china with a significant negative influence of ar due to the decrease in precipitation in addition ae is a comprehensive reflection of evaporation specifically as ae increases the amount of evaporation increases and the irrigation water consumption increases according to research of zhang et al 2016 temperature was also an important climatic factor in the interior area as a result of the insufficient rainfall and great evaporation which was consistent with the results of fig 7f in which the positive effect of temperature on piwc in northern china was greater than that in southern china it is worth noting that the difference in the temperature effect on tiwc was not obvious due to the limitations of zhang s study the lack of consideration of other socioeconomic and environmental factors affecting irrigation water consumption may result in discrepancies and tiwc was more susceptible to other non meteorological conditions 3 3 spatial variation in driving factors of irrigation water consumption to analyze the spatial effect in the driving factors of irrigation water consumption in the 31 provinces in china a comprehensive coefficient of the categorical driving factors calculated using the ahp was used to conduct clustering analysis the comprehensive coefficients and the clustering centers of categorical driving factors of tiwc are shown in fig 8 and table 5 indicating that the 31 provinces were divided into 4 categories using the k means clustering method for the categorical driving factors the first region including the 5 provinces of sichuan shaanxi jiangxi jiangsu and tianjin was mainly affected by planting size followed by climatic conditions and water consumption structure and finally economic development the second region including 10 provinces such as yunnan guangdong zhejiang and jilin was distributed in the southeastern coast southwest china and northeast china and was mainly influenced by other factors except for climatic conditions with the highest comprehensive coefficient in planting structure the third region including gansu henan hunan and shanghai distributed in central china was mainly influenced by irrigation technique followed by water consumption structure and climatic conditions and was slightly impacted by planting size and economic development the fourth region including tibet qinghai xinjiang and hebei distributed in northwest and north china was mainly influenced by other factors except for planting structure with the highest comprehensive coefficient found for irrigation technique and economic development generally water consumption structure and irrigation technique mainly affected central china and planting size mainly affected north china as the main influencing factor of tiwc which had a great influence on almost all provinces climatic conditions mainly affected central china and southwest china and economic development partly affected most provinces the comprehensive coefficients and the clustering centers of the categorical driving factors of piwc are shown in fig 9 and table 6 indicating that the 31 provinces were divided into 3 categories using the k means clustering method on categorical driving factors the first region including xinjiang qinghai shanxi and hebei was distributed in 13 provinces in northwest north and central china and this region was mainly affected by irrigation technique water consumption structure and planting size followed by economic development and climatic conditions the second region including tibet sichuan hubei and hunan was distributed in 7 provinces in southwest and central china and this region was significantly influenced by water consumption structure followed by planting size and climatic conditions the third region including yunnan guizhou and fujian was distributed in 11 provinces in southeast south east and northeast china and was mainly influenced by planting structure followed by planting size economic development and water consumption structure generally piwc was most influenced by water consumption structure in most provinces especially central china followed by planting size which mainly affected southwest east and northeast china and irrigation technique which had a negative influence in most provinces climatic conditions mainly affected central china and southwest china and economic development partly affected most provinces the influencing factors of irrigation water consumption are complex and there are significant differences in different regions therefore appropriate agricultural water management measures and policies should be implemented in each province according to the main influencing factors of irrigation water consumption in different regions with the purpose of improving the management level of irrigation water studying the development mode of water saving irrigation of each regions and promoting the realization of the sustainable utilization of water resources according to the study of zhang and guo 2016 the model consisting of the planting structure and the water resource allocation under the conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater could be used to save irrigation water in fengdong district which was aligned with the policy advocated by this study 4 conclusions based on the data of irrigation water consumption and its driving factors in china this study adopted the regression pca method to analyze the main influencing factors of irrigation water consumption and its spatial variation the results showed that planting size rsw of water consumption structure planting structure and ae and aat of climatic conditions had positive effects while irrigation technique economic development and ar of climatic conditions had negative effects on irrigation water consumption in general due to the influence of agricultural development planting structure and other factors the rules of driving factors affecting irrigation water consumption varied in each province generally irrigation water consumption was greatly influenced by the water consumption structure irrigation technique and planting structure while there were significant differences in different regions which required future sub regional studies for tiwc central china was mainly affected by water consumption structure irrigation technique and climatic conditions and north and northwest china were hardly influenced by planting structure then northeast southwest and southeast coastal china were slightly affected by climatic conditions for piwc central china was mainly affected by the water consumption structure irrigation technique planting size and climatic conditions southwest south east and northeast china were mainly affected by planting structure and planting size and northwest and north china were mainly influenced by irrigation technique water consumption structure and planting size moreover further statistical models are needed to predict the irrigation water consumption according to the major driving force and selection and improvement of models in different regions should be considered for the purpose of better allocation of water resources to local conditions in addition the annual irrigation water consumption is the main focus in the study while the change of irrigation water consumption in a year could be notable in some regions which is a huge challenge to the allocation of water resources therefore the driving force analysis of seasonal or monthly irrigation water consumption is an area

10639,the effective management of irrigation water consumption is one of the main countermeasures to combat water shortages this paper introduced an integrated approach to determine the major factors influencing irrigation water consumption in china it combined multiple linear regression and principal component analysis to analyze the relationship between irrigation water consumption and influencing factors and then applied analytic hierarchy process and cluster analysis to analyze the spatial variation in driving factors of irrigation water consumption based on statistical data from the 31 provinces of china from 2000 to 2015 the results showed that irrigation water consumption was positively affected by the planting size the ratio of surface water in water consumption rsw the planting structure the annual et0 ae and the annual average temperature aat in contrast consumption was generally negatively affected by irrigation technique economic development and annual rainfall ar the water consumption structure irrigation technique and planting structure were major influential factors in most provinces of china and there were significant differences in different regions thus regions should be restructured to be studied as subregions for the total consumption of irrigation water central china was mainly affected by the water consumption structure irrigation technique and climatic conditions and north and northwest china were hardly influenced by planting structure northeast southwest and southeastern coastal china were slightly affected by climatic conditions for the per unit area irrigation water consumption central china was mainly affected by the water consumption structure irrigation technique planting size and climatic conditions southwest south east and northeast china were mainly affected by the planting structure and planting size and northwest and north china were mainly influenced by the irrigation technique water consumption structure and planting size keywords irrigation water consumption driving force analysis regression pca model analytic hierarchy process cluster analysis 1 introduction as one of the countries with serious water resource shortages china s economic development and social security have been severely affected by increasingly serious water resource shortages which makes this topic an urgent issue that must be addressed guo and shen 2016 to solve the water crisis problem and achieve the sustainable development of water resources controlling irrigation water consumption is an effective approach because irrigation water consumption accounts for more than 60 of the country s total water consumption prc 2018 kang et al 2017 with improvements in irrigation technology the water productivity of the agricultural sector of china has continuously increased in recent years however the total amount of agricultural water has not declined as expected due to the rebound effect in agricultural water song et al 2018 this scenario means that irrigation water consumption does not simply change with a single factor but is influenced by a combination of factors therefore it is of great practical significance to analyze the driving factors and reveal the main influencing factors of irrigation water consumption numerous studies have analyzed the driving factors of irrigation water consumption and agricultural water use the impact of climate on irrigation water consumption in southern china mo et al 2017 and agricultural water use in northern china lu et al 2018 was studied doungmanee 2016 studied the nexus of agricultural water use and economic development level in 154 countries and found that the quantity of water used for agricultural purposes gradually increased with the income of that country urbanization was found to have a negative influence on agricultural water use in china by yan et al 2015 the effects of climatic and anthropogenic e g crop pattern and changes in cultivation area factors on irrigation water consumption were investigated in the urmia lake river basin taheri et al 2019 these studies indicated that irrigation water consumption was influenced by many factors such as climatic conditions planting structure and economic development level however there are generally uncertainties nonlinearity and space time variability of the impact of these factors even if the same kind of influencing factors e g economic factors dissimilar effects are showed in different regions doungmanee 2016 yan et al 2015 therefore it is necessary to select the driving factors of irrigation water consumption comprehensively and carry out quantitative analysis and spatial distribution analysis on the influencing factors of irrigation water consumption systematically as regards researches of analysis methods many scholars have carried out thorough analyses of irrigation water consumption change mechanisms in different areas using the following methods 1 regression analysis method abu madi 2009 revealed that irrigation water consumption was related to water pricing using a regression model in tulkarm district palestine the relationships between water consumption and agricultural gdp growth water structure and agricultural water saving situations were compared by adopting a multiple linear regression model in zhejiang china xu 2012 ma et al 2012 used information entropy for analysis and simulated the influencing factors by a multiple linear regression model on regional water consumption 2 grey analysis method the correlation between the agricultural water consumption and agricultural output value structure in beijing was quantitatively analyzed by the grey correlation method wang and chuan 2019 3 factor decomposition analysis method the logarithmic mean divisa index lmdi decomposition and stochastic impact by regression on population affluence and technology stirpat were employed to quantify the variation in driving factors in irrigation water demand zhao et al 2014 zou et al 2018 xie and su 2017 4 principal component analysis method principal component analysis was applied to extract the main driving factors affecting changes in irrigation water use efficiency fang et al 2017 and regional water consumption lu et al 2018 studies in various areas have shown that irrigation water consumption has changed in recent years and some studies have drawn conclusions about the main driving factors however there are certain drawbacks associated with the use of the above methods regression analysis method requires large amount of data and is prone to multicollinearity while the result of grey analysis method would be affected by the artificial weights factor decomposition analysis is mainly limited to the decomposition analysis of agricultural water resource change which is difficult to be used in the prediction principal component analysis is mainly used to extract important information and reveal the structure of data which needs to be combined with correlation analysis clustering analysis regression analysis and other methods therefore in order to analyze the numerous driving factors of irrigation water consumption the regression pca model was adopted combining multiple linear regression and principal component analysis pca the regression coefficient of the multiple linear regression model can reflect the difference among the driving factors and the regression model can be used for prediction which has guiding significance in water resources allocation in addition pca can convert the original variables to a few influencing factors that are not related to each other and eliminate multicollinearity in multiple linear regression to further analyze the spatial effect of the influencing factors the analytic hierarchy process ahp and cluster analysis were introduced to comprehensively analyze the influence of various influencing factors which provided guidance for the selection of corresponding water saving methods and efficient allocation policies of water resources in different regions this study is designed 1 to establish a regression pca model that combines principal component analysis with multiple linear regression for 31 provinces in china 2 to evaluate the relationship between irrigation water consumption and the influencing factors and 3 to compare the spatial variation in the influencing factors of irrigation water consumption to provide guidance for practical work such as the specific water supply water use planning and management the main innovation of this paper is to propose a systematic analysis method of driving force for irrigation water consumption and pay attention to the comparative study of regional differences the characteristics of each region will be illuminated to present scientific evidence about macro decision making classification guidance and planning for water resource allocation 2 materials and methodology in this work we proposed a method for driving force analysis of irrigation water consumption using multiple approaches proper irrigation water consumption indexes and driving factor indexes were selected and relative statistical data for 31 provinces in china from 2001 to 2015 were collected to establish the regression pca model to analyze the relationship between irrigation water consumption and its driving factors an analytic hierarchy process was adopted to analyze the relative importance and influence degree of various categories of driving factors then cluster analysis was used to classify the regression coefficients of the driving factors of irrigation water consumption at the provincial scale for spatial variation analysis 2 1 study area and data considering the characteristics of natural geography and human geography this study divided the 31 provinces of china into seven regions based on the natural geographical division of luo 1954 as shown in fig 1 the seven regions included east china north china northeast china central china south china southwest china and northwest china in addition northern china and southern china which were divided by the boundary of the qinling mountains and huaihe river had obvious differences in topography climate and culture making this boundary one of the most important natural geographical divisions in china the relevant data from 2000 to 2015 were collected from the water resources bulletin and statistical yearbooks of 31 provinces in china the china meteorological information center and the china water resources statistical yearbook the irrigation water consumption of 31 provinces was collected from the water resources bulletin the planting area grain yield agricultural product per capita gdp and planting structure were collected from the statistical yearbook the actual irrigation area and water saving irrigation area were collected from the china water resources statistical yearbook the meteorological data were downloaded from the china meteorological information center http data cma cn and the cumulative investment related to the reconstruction and water saving reform of large sized irrigation districts was provided by the china irrigation and drainage development center irrigation water consumption is influenced by many factors such as natural conditions irrigation technology planting size and economic development based on the statistical data from 2000 to 2015 the irrigation water consumption indexes and driving factor indexes were identified the irrigation water consumption indexes included the total consumption of irrigation water tiwc and the per unit area irrigation water consumption piwc the driving factor indexes for irrigation water consumption were divided into 6 categories the index system and the meaning of each driving factor index are shown in table 1 2 2 regression pca model a multiple linear regression model was applied to find the relationship between irrigation water consumption and its driving factors and to determine the influence of each factor on irrigation water consumption in the real world the correlations among the factors will distort the model estimation and make it difficult to driving force analysis in this paper to eliminate the multicollinearity among variables principal component analysis pca which was originally developed by pearson 1901 was introduced and combined with multiple linear regression to form a regression pca model for the driving force analysis of irrigation water consumption pca is an approach for reducing dimensionality that converts a set of correlated features using orthogonal transformation into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables without losing much information the new form of transformation called principal components is sorted from the largest possible variance to the lowest possible variance if we consider a matrix x each of the n rows represents the data of one year s 13 indicators for one province and each of the p columns provides the data of one indicator in 16 years for one province the data matrix x is shown as the following 1 x x 11 x 12 x 1 p x 21 x 22 x 2 p x n 1 x n 2 x n p in matrix x n represents the number of years 16 years and p represents the number of driving factors 13 indicators the principal components were calculated as follows 1 data standardization the original data were standardized as follows 2 x i j x i j x j σ j i 1 2 n j 1 2 p where x j and σ j are the mean and deviation of variable j respectively 2 calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix considering matrix r as the covariance matrix of matrix x the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix r were calculated based on 3 λ e r 0 where λ 1 λ 2 λn are the eigenvalues of matrix r and l 1 l 2 ln are the corresponding eigenvectors 3 calculation of the contribution rate of variance and cumulative variance these variables were calculated as follows 4 e p λ i i 1 n λ i 5 e p j 1 p λ j i 1 n λ i 4 selection of the principal component generally the principal components are extracted from the largest possible variance to the lowest until the contribution rate of the cumulative variance reaches 80 or the eigenvalue is greater than 1 in this study to avoid losing important information the cumulative contribution rate should exceed 90 when determining the number of principal components 5 calculation of the principal component score the score of variable i of principal component j was calculated as follows 6 u i j x i t l j j 1 2 k where k is the number of principal components the full principal component decomposition of x can therefore be given as 7 u x l l l 1 l k using irrigation water consumption as the dependent variable and the extracted principal component as the independent variable a multiple linear regression model was established as follows 8 y i b 0 j 1 k b j x j i ε i i 1 2 n where b0 and bj are the regression coefficients of the model which can be estimated by the least square method the regression coefficients of the original data driving factors can be converted through the principal component score as the influence of dimensionality has been eliminated through data standardization the standardized regression coefficient can be used to measure the degree to which different factors affect irrigation water consumption 2 3 analytic hierarchy process as the driving factors of the same category were not of the same importance when compared with each other the analytic hierarchy process ahp developed by saaty 1977 was adopted to analyze and determine the relative importance of various categories of driving factors and the comprehensive coefficient of various categorical driving factors was calculated in this study the hierarchical structure was divided into two layers the bottom layer was each specific driving factor and the top layer was each categorical driving factor in the same hierarchy the judgment matrix was constructed by pairwise comparison numbers 1 9 and their reciprocals were used as the scale to define the judgment matrix in table 2 considering matrix a as the judgment matrix the factors were sorted by relative weight according to the eigenvector corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue of matrix a in this paper the geometric average method was introduced to solve the weight vector as follows 9 w i j 1 n a i j 1 n i 1 n j 1 n a i j 1 n the consistency of the judgment matrix can be tested as follows 10 c r c i r i where ci is the consistency index and ri is the mean random consistency index which is shown in table 3 when cr 0 10 the consistency of the judgment matrix is acceptable otherwise the judgment matrix should be modified appropriately franek and kresta 2014 ci can be calculated as follows 11 c i λ max n n 1 where λ max represents the maximum eigenvalue of matrix a and n is the number of driving factors included in the same categorical driving factor 2 4 cluster analysis cluster analysis is a multivariate technique used to find groups of objects such that the objects in a group will be similar or related to one another and different from or unrelated to the objects in other groups tan et al 2006 in this paper the k means cluster method was introduced to classify the regression coefficients of the driving factors of irrigation water consumption at the provincial scale for analyzing the spatial variation in the driving factors of irrigation water consumption k means is a nonhierarchical method that seeks to minimize the within class sum of squares k means often begins with an initial guess of the group centroids and then iteratively searches for the solution bible et al 2013 let mj t be the centroid of the j th cluster of period t and d xj mj t denote the euclidean distance between xj and mj t then the objective is to minimize 12 d x i m j t min d x i m j t j 1 2 k i 1 2 n then xj cj depending on which centroid they are close to since the classification of period t has been made new centroids of period t 1 were calculated as follows 13 m j t 1 1 n j i 1 x i c j n j x i j 1 2 k then process it iteratively until 14 m j t 1 m j t ε j 1 2 k where ε represents the maximum permissible error 3 results and discussion 3 1 establishing the regression pca model of irrigation water consumption the extraction results of the principal components and evaluation parameters of the regression pca model of irrigation water consumption in the 31 provinces are shown in table 4 after the principal component analysis the variable space was reduced from 13 original independent variables to 4 5 linearly uncorrelated variables which solved the distortion problem caused by the high correlation observed in previous studies the cumulative contribution rate of the main factor eigenvalues for 31 provinces reached 90 which indicated that the selected principal components covered almost all the information of the indicators when establishing the regression pca model the non significant principal component factors have been removed thus only the significant factors were retained in the model the significance test parameter sig indicates that most regression models pass the significance test α 0 05 except for tiwc of guizhou shaanxi and piwc of beijing anhui shaanxi and qinghai the average adjusted r2 values of the tiwc and piwc regression pca models are 0 725 and 0 649 respectively which indicates that the changes in driving factors can explain most of the irrigation water consumption fluctuation and the tiwc regression pca model fits slightly better than the piwc regression pca model irrigation water consumption is affected by many driving factors such as natural conditions infrastructure economic development and planting size in this paper the regression pca method was used to analyze the main influencing factors of irrigation water consumption at the provincial scale which not only solved the multicollinearity problem among multiple driving factors but also illuminated how driving factors affect irrigation water consumption through regression coefficients however the linear regression model can explain only the linear relationship between the driving factors and irrigation water consumption the time span of the data in this paper is only 16 years and most driving factors are linearly related to irrigation water consumption thus this method is applicable in long term historical data analysis with obvious segmentation phenomena it is necessary to analyze the data by segmenting or selecting other nonlinear methods such as nonlinear regression and bp neural network methods liu et al 2011 sharifi and langari 2017 3 2 driving factor analysis of irrigation water consumption the regression coefficients of the tiwc regression pca model of planting size are shown in fig 2 the average regression coefficients of pa gy and aia in each province are 0 068 0 042 and 0 062 respectively which means that planting size generally has a positive effect on tiwc pa gy and aia reflect the planting size of each province to a certain extent while gy is influenced by many factors such as agricultural technology fertility varieties and water content which makes the contribution of gy on tiwc less than that of pa and aia aia was excluded from the driving factor analysis of piwc because it had been included in the calculation of piwc the average regression coefficients of pa and gy in each province are 0 032 and 0 006 respectively which means that planting size generally has a slightly positive effect on piwc however there are significant differences between the north and the south in which the planting size has a positive contribution in the south and a negative contribution in the north that the relationship between planting size and piwc varies in different regions may be related to the difference in water resources southern china which is rich in water resources mainly plants high water consuming crops such as paddy rice the relatively extensive irrigation management causes a greater water loss in a larger area resulting in a larger piwc crops with less water consumption such as wheat and maize are mainly planted in northern china moreover strict irrigation management in northern china lowers the amount of water loss in a larger area resulting in a smaller piwc feng 2013 indicated that the water efficiency of irrigation in southern provinces was significantly lower than that in northern provinces which was aligned with the results in the current study because rsw was absolutely large in southern china and varied slightly in different years to avoid amplifying the random fluctuations of the standardized driving factors over time rsw was excluded in the analysis of driving factors in provinces whose rsw values exceeded 90 on average this exclusion occurred because it was assumed that the irrigation water consumption in these provinces was hardly affected by rsw the regression coefficients of the tiwc and piwc regression pca models of water consumption structure are shown in fig 3 the average regression coefficients of rsw and rna in each province are 0 055 and 0 172 respectively the increase of rws contributed positively on tiwc in the provinces affected by rsw because the water supply for irrigation water consumption is composed of surface water and groundwater surface water which is not as easily obtained as groundwater cannot be flexibly adjusted based on the irrigation time and the amount required for the growth of the crop a large amount of water resources will be wasted during water transportation with a low irrigation water use efficiency wang and zhao 2008 thus the increase of rsw would lead to a higher irrigation water consumption most provinces in china are negatively affected by rna on tiwc and the influence is greater in southern china than in northern china from the perspective of regional economic development the benefit of water per unit volume of industry is far greater than that of agriculture thus local governments prefer to distribute the limited water resources to industrial development with the development of industry the proportion of non agricultural water use increases and the proportion of agricultural water use decreases under the limited total water resources causing tiwc to decrease the average regression coefficients of piwc of rsw and rna in each province are 0 082 and 0 175 respectively which indicates a similar influence rule consistent with that of the tiwc the regression coefficients of the tiwc and piwc regression pca models of irrigation technique are shown in fig 4 the average regression coefficients of rws of tiwc and piwc in each province are 0 092 and 0 071 respectively which shows that rws has a negative impact on irrigation water consumption in most provinces rws can reflect the water saving irrigation technology level water saving irrigation technology especially community based technologies including canal seepage control low pressure pipe irrigation sprinkler irrigation and micro irrigation technology can reduce the water loss during irrigation and enhance the irrigation water use efficiency and save water blanke et al 2007 however rws may have a positive effect on irrigation water consumption in the period of agricultural expansion when rws is increasing and the agricultural scale is expanding because in the period of agricultural expansion water saving irrigation is developing in the region and the saved irrigation water is used to expand the irrigation area which weakens the water saving effect brought by the improvement of water saving irrigation technology han 2014 this result agreed with the study by batchelor et al 2014 which found that improved efficiency productivity and profitability encouraged farmers to increase the area cropped and or to adopt multiple cropping systems with increased consumptive water use zhang and guo 2016 also determined that the water uses could be increased after improving irrigation efficiency under the condition of a limited water supply and unrestricted irrigable land the regression coefficients of the tiwc and piwc regression pca models of economic development are shown in fig 5 the average regression coefficients of ci ap and pgdp of the regression pca model in each province are 0 004 0 013 and 0 010 respectively for tiwc and 0 046 0 059 and 0 055 respectively for piwc which means that economic development generally has a negative effect on irrigation water consumption however significant differences exist in the influence of economic development on irrigation water consumption in different regions and these differences are related to the stage of agricultural development in the region modern agricultural development in china has been divided into three stages shi et al 2012 1 preliminary implementation stage of agriculture modernization the agricultural development had gradually separated from the traditional agricultural stage characterized by the stagnation of technology and the growth of production mainly relied on the growth of traditional agricultural inputs the extensive application of agricultural technology has obviously promoted agricultural development 2 basic implementation stage of agriculture modernization modernization characteristics were shown in this stage and land productivity labor productivity and resource utilization obviously increased 3 comprehensive implementation stage of agriculture modernization the agricultural economy agricultural society and natural environment entered a stage of coordinated and sustainable development in northwest and southwest china economic development has a positive influence on tiwc and piwc which indicates that the western part is in a transition period from the traditional agricultural stage to the preliminary implementation stage of agricultural modernization abundant water resources are allocated into agricultural production with the rapid development of agriculture and the irrigation technology and irrigation water use efficiency are unqualified resulting in increasing irrigation water consumption economic development has a positive influence on tiwc and a negative influence on piwc in northeast china which is in the preliminary implementation stage of agricultural modernization with developing agriculture and increasing irrigation water in addition the irrigation water use efficiency is improved and piwc is reduced with the wide application of agricultural science and technology there is a slight negative influence from economic development on the tiwc and piwc in central china indicating the transition from the preliminary implementation stage to the basic implementation stage of agricultural modernization the tiwc and piwc are decreased with slowing agricultural growth and improving irrigation water use efficiency the economic development of east and north china has a large negative impact on tiwc and piwc indicating that east and north china are in the basic implementation stage of agricultural modernization in which the irrigation water use efficiency is significantly improved resulting in a significant decline in tiwc and piwc the regression coefficients of the tiwc and piwc regression pca models of planting structure are shown in fig 6 because rpr was absolutely small in northern china and varied slightly in different years in some provinces in southern china to avoid standardized data amplifying the random fluctuations of driving factors over time rpr was excluded in the analysis of driving factors in provinces where the rpr did not reach 10 on average or where the interannual variation was less than 5 considering that the irrigation water consumption in these provinces was hardly affected by rpr the average regression coefficients of the rpr of the regression pca model in each province are 0 119 for tiwc and 0 123 for piwc which indicates that rpr has a great positive effect in most southern provinces as the proportion of high water consumption crops e g paddy rice increases the greater the irrigation water consumption will be kaneko et al 2005 it s worth noting that only prp was selected in this paper to analyze the impact of planting structure on irrigation water consumption that is the planting structure was divided into paddy rice and other upland crops without taking into account the impact of the proportion of different upland crops on irrigation water consumption this is because water used for paddy rice irrigation in china accounts for a large proportion 60 of irrigation water consumption which makes a critical contribution therefore when the method in this paper is applied to other countries or regions it is necessary to select appropriate crops to reflect the planting structure for analysis the regression coefficients of the tiwc and piwc regression pca models of climatic condition are shown in fig 7 the average regression coefficients of ar ae and aat of the regression pca model in each province are 0 092 0 050 and 0 019 respectively for tiwc and 0 072 0 028 and 0 002 respectively for piwc which means a negative influence of ar and a positive influence of ae and aat on tiwc and piwc from the analysis of the water demand mechanism precipitation as an important climatic factor will affect solar radiation air temperature air humidity and soil moisture content thus affecting the evapotranspiration of crops and irrigation water consumption less irrigation water can meet the growth demand of crops by taking advantage of rainfall as a supplementary water source in areas with sufficient and evenly distributed precipitation wang et al 2017 revealed that the irrigation requirement of rice would present a remarkable increase in nanjing and kunshan which are distributed in east china with a significant negative influence of ar due to the decrease in precipitation in addition ae is a comprehensive reflection of evaporation specifically as ae increases the amount of evaporation increases and the irrigation water consumption increases according to research of zhang et al 2016 temperature was also an important climatic factor in the interior area as a result of the insufficient rainfall and great evaporation which was consistent with the results of fig 7f in which the positive effect of temperature on piwc in northern china was greater than that in southern china it is worth noting that the difference in the temperature effect on tiwc was not obvious due to the limitations of zhang s study the lack of consideration of other socioeconomic and environmental factors affecting irrigation water consumption may result in discrepancies and tiwc was more susceptible to other non meteorological conditions 3 3 spatial variation in driving factors of irrigation water consumption to analyze the spatial effect in the driving factors of irrigation water consumption in the 31 provinces in china a comprehensive coefficient of the categorical driving factors calculated using the ahp was used to conduct clustering analysis the comprehensive coefficients and the clustering centers of categorical driving factors of tiwc are shown in fig 8 and table 5 indicating that the 31 provinces were divided into 4 categories using the k means clustering method for the categorical driving factors the first region including the 5 provinces of sichuan shaanxi jiangxi jiangsu and tianjin was mainly affected by planting size followed by climatic conditions and water consumption structure and finally economic development the second region including 10 provinces such as yunnan guangdong zhejiang and jilin was distributed in the southeastern coast southwest china and northeast china and was mainly influenced by other factors except for climatic conditions with the highest comprehensive coefficient in planting structure the third region including gansu henan hunan and shanghai distributed in central china was mainly influenced by irrigation technique followed by water consumption structure and climatic conditions and was slightly impacted by planting size and economic development the fourth region including tibet qinghai xinjiang and hebei distributed in northwest and north china was mainly influenced by other factors except for planting structure with the highest comprehensive coefficient found for irrigation technique and economic development generally water consumption structure and irrigation technique mainly affected central china and planting size mainly affected north china as the main influencing factor of tiwc which had a great influence on almost all provinces climatic conditions mainly affected central china and southwest china and economic development partly affected most provinces the comprehensive coefficients and the clustering centers of the categorical driving factors of piwc are shown in fig 9 and table 6 indicating that the 31 provinces were divided into 3 categories using the k means clustering method on categorical driving factors the first region including xinjiang qinghai shanxi and hebei was distributed in 13 provinces in northwest north and central china and this region was mainly affected by irrigation technique water consumption structure and planting size followed by economic development and climatic conditions the second region including tibet sichuan hubei and hunan was distributed in 7 provinces in southwest and central china and this region was significantly influenced by water consumption structure followed by planting size and climatic conditions the third region including yunnan guizhou and fujian was distributed in 11 provinces in southeast south east and northeast china and was mainly influenced by planting structure followed by planting size economic development and water consumption structure generally piwc was most influenced by water consumption structure in most provinces especially central china followed by planting size which mainly affected southwest east and northeast china and irrigation technique which had a negative influence in most provinces climatic conditions mainly affected central china and southwest china and economic development partly affected most provinces the influencing factors of irrigation water consumption are complex and there are significant differences in different regions therefore appropriate agricultural water management measures and policies should be implemented in each province according to the main influencing factors of irrigation water consumption in different regions with the purpose of improving the management level of irrigation water studying the development mode of water saving irrigation of each regions and promoting the realization of the sustainable utilization of water resources according to the study of zhang and guo 2016 the model consisting of the planting structure and the water resource allocation under the conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater could be used to save irrigation water in fengdong district which was aligned with the policy advocated by this study 4 conclusions based on the data of irrigation water consumption and its driving factors in china this study adopted the regression pca method to analyze the main influencing factors of irrigation water consumption and its spatial variation the results showed that planting size rsw of water consumption structure planting structure and ae and aat of climatic conditions had positive effects while irrigation technique economic development and ar of climatic conditions had negative effects on irrigation water consumption in general due to the influence of agricultural development planting structure and other factors the rules of driving factors affecting irrigation water consumption varied in each province generally irrigation water consumption was greatly influenced by the water consumption structure irrigation technique and planting structure while there were significant differences in different regions which required future sub regional studies for tiwc central china was mainly affected by water consumption structure irrigation technique and climatic conditions and north and northwest china were hardly influenced by planting structure then northeast southwest and southeast coastal china were slightly affected by climatic conditions for piwc central china was mainly affected by the water consumption structure irrigation technique planting size and climatic conditions southwest south east and northeast china were mainly affected by planting structure and planting size and northwest and north china were mainly influenced by irrigation technique water consumption structure and planting size moreover further statistical models are needed to predict the irrigation water consumption according to the major driving force and selection and improvement of models in different regions should be considered for the purpose of better allocation of water resources to local conditions in addition the annual irrigation water consumption is the main focus in the study while the change of irrigation water consumption in a year could be notable in some regions which is a huge challenge to the allocation of water resources therefore the driving force analysis of seasonal or monthly irrigation water consumption is an area
