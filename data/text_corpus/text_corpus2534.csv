aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel nanosorbent with micro and nanopores such well ordered porous network structure indicates the high surface area of the nanosorbent making it a good candidate in adsorptive coagulation process of metal qds additionally the edx analysis fig 1b confirmed the integration and uniform distribution of magcof within the hydrogel nanosorbent this is characterized by the presence of significant amounts of fe 1 98 wt and co 0 86 wt uniformly distributed over the sample fig 1b shows also the presence of high amounts of c 46 52 wt n 22 22 wt and o 22 50 wt referring to the aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel finally the edx results were also found useful in confirming the adsorptive removal of ag au qds onto magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel nanosorbent as shown in fig 1b this could be judged by high adsorbed levels of ag 16 57 wt and au 16 17 wt onto the nanosorbent moreover the tem images fig 1s supplementary information indicated the formation of nps with size ranging from 3 to 10 nm for both metals as represented in fig 1c the ft ir spectrum of magcof shows an intense peak at 565 cm 1 which is related to fe co o tetrahedral stretching 39 two additional strong stretching bands were observed at 1210 cm 1 and 1356 cm 1 due to co alkyl aryl ether and cn aromatic amine respectively upon formation of magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel nanosorbent further absorption bands were noted at 862 cm 1 1027 cm 1 and 1168 cm 1 which are corresponding to bo bond of tetrahedral borate structure and cn stretching of amine groups respectively the former confirms the initiated crosslinking by tetrahedral borate structure which is further supported by a strong absorption band at 1442 cm 1 owing to the stretching relaxation of boc 40 41 presence of amine groups could be also confirmed by a strong band at 3251 cm 1 of nh stretching the xrd technique was used to identify the synthetized hydrogel nanosorbent before and after the coagulative removal of metal qds fig 1d the xrd of cof fig 1d a exhibits two broad peaks centered at 2θ 18 96 and 43 23 the diffraction pattern of magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel fig 1d b shows several characteristic peaks at 2θ 29 86 35 28 42 79 56 62 and 62 27 which are corresponding to 220 311 400 511 and 440 facets respectively of fcc cofe2o4 j c p d s 22 1086 of a computed average size 22 13 nm scherrer equation eq 1 table 2s supplementary information following ag qds adsorption fig 1d c additional xrd peaks were revealed at 2θ 38 09 44 14 64 34 and 77 38 which are related to

adsorption and aggregation of ag qds on the nanosorbent surface au qds showed typical xrd peaks fig 1d d of gold with the 111 facet peak dominating at 2θ 37 99 j c p d s 0 004 0784 and a computed particle diameter of 15 93 nm other peaks at 2θ 44 31 64 51 and 77 51 were also noted and related to the 200 220 and 311 facets of the same crystal lattice xps analysis table 1 was utilized to confirm the chemical composition of magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel which was initially predicted from the xrd and edx results the xps results of magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel fig 2 indicate the presence of b c n and o with their characteristic peaks at 191 56 ev 285 92 ev 400 25 ev and 532 27 ev respectively furthermore c 1s peak was resolved into three well defined peaks at 284 28 ev 285 56 ev and 287 70 ev the 284 28 ev peak refers to ch and cc hydrocarbon bonds atomic 41 15 in the magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel structure while the 285 56 ev peak refers to cn bonds of the existing amine groups atomic 53 91 42 finally the 287 70 ev peak is related to coc oco and coh bonds in the agar hydrogel structure atomic 4 94 43 additionally n 1s showed two significant peaks at 399 00 ev and 399 64 ev and both are referring to cn bonds of two different amine groups 44 the first one is existing within the aminated agar hydrogel skeleton atomic 25 50 and the other is present in the magcofs structure atomic 74 50 high resolution spectrum of o 1s also revealed two distinctive peaks at 531 06 ev and 532 34 ev which are probably related to the cob linkage as also confirmed by the b 1s peak at 191 56 ev 40 while the second peak at 532 34 refers to co bonds either in the magcof network or in the aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel structure 45 3 2 coagulative removal of metal qds by magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel 3 2 1 ag au qds adsorption mechanism in general metal qds and nanoparticles removal mechanisms are complex as due to involvement of one or more of the following coagulative adsorption driving forces as chemical bonding hydrogen bonding ion exchange electrostatic interactions van der waals force hydrophobic attractions physical adsorption and aggregation 34 for ag and au qds adsorption on magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel nanosorbent hard soft acid base interaction could be a possible route between n atoms and ag au atoms to form metal ligand bonds 38 additionally coagulative adsorption mechanism could involve an electrostatic interaction between metal qds and the hydrogel via van der waal forces above all the huge and highly ordered porosity of the utilized substrate could be of great advantages in terms of surface area and exposed adsorption sites this assumption was confirmed by acquiring the surface area of magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel nanosorbent using bet method and found to correspond to 306 m2 g therefore magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel nanosorbent is expected to adsorb large amount of metal qds and it could be a competing candidate for their coagulative removal from wastewater 46 ag au qds removal through adsorption onto magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel nanosorbent can be affected by various parameters as the solution ph time of reaction quantity of magcof aminated agar fbp biochar initial metal qds dosage temperature and ionic strength 16 17 all these parameters are discussed in details in the upcoming paragraphs 3 2 2 effect of ph solution ph is an important parameter that can influence the electrostatic interaction between small metal nanoparticles and the sorbent to limit instability issues a ph range 5 11 was selected au and ag qds removal percentages fig 3a are almost steady in the ph range 5 10 with the highest value at ph 5 on the other hand removal percentage towards both metal qds were drastically droped at ph 11 the enhancement in au and ag qds adsorption of on magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel nanosorbent upon decreasing solution ph is related to the contribution of amino groups of the nanosorbent at lower ph values higher concentrations of h ions amino groups were protonated to form the corresponding positively charged ammonium cation this situation was identified to enhance the electrostatic interaction between the nanosorbent and the negatively charged particles at high ph values excess oh ions reverse the charge on the nanosorbent surface initiating repulsive forces between the similarly charged particles and nanosorbent 47 this prediction is supported by the observed hydrogel point of zero charge pzc values shown in fig 3b based on these findings the optimum ph value ph 5 was fixed for the rest of experiments 3 2 3 effect of magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel dosage on qds removal removal of metal qds was studied using nanosorbent dossage of various masses 1 30 mg the hydrogel mass was mixed with an aqueous qds solution 10 ml 50 mg l 1 through shaking 10 min for ag qds or 3 min for au qds at 298 k while maintaining the optimal solution at ph 5 as shown in fig 4 increasing the amount of hydrogel nanosorbent increased the efficiency of metal qds removal to reach 97 1 and 98 5 removal percentages at hydrogel dosage of 30 mg for ag au qds subsequently this trend is in good agreement with the increase in available adsorption sites with increasing the amount of the biosorbent 15 48 the fact that au qds removal percentage 98 5 at 30 mg hydrogel mass is higher than ag qds removal percentage may be due to au qds competitive ability to experience ion exchange interactions with the ions existing at the adsorbent surface 3 2 4 effect of shaking duration ag and au qds removal percentages were investigated by mixing magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel with an aqueous solution of qds 10 ml 50 mg l 1 and measuring the qds residual concentration at different time intervals it was observed that ag au qds removal reaches saturation after 30 min with related removal efficiencies of 97 6 and 100 respectively as shown in fig 5 metal qds removal kinetics was modeled by correlating the collected data with several kinetic models pseudo first order pseudo second order intraparticle diffusion and elvoich in lights of these studies a suitable adsorption mechanism of ag au qds onto the nanosorbent was proposed 49 the correlation coefficients r2 values summarized in table 1 indicates better fitting in case of pseudo second order model with r2 1 for the adsorptive removal of both metals 0 998 0 993 for ag and au subsequently additionally calculated qe values 121 95 mg g 1 for ag qds 125 00 mg g 1 for au qds fitted perfectly with those obtained experimentally 121 95 mg g 1 for ag qds 124 18 mg g 1 for au qds this result proposes an adsorption mechanism with a dominant chemisorption process 3 2 5 initial metal qds concentration effect and elucidation of adsorption isotherms fitting the experimental data with the main adsorption isotherms was considered to reveal the nature of sorbent adsorbent interaction and to correlate between the removal percentage and initial metal qds concentration under fixed temperature 298 k and ph 5 conditions an increase in the removal efficiency was observed upon increasing the initial metal qds concentration with maximum removal r 95 86 98 59 in case of 50 mg l 1 ag au qds subsequently fig 6 the experimental data were interpreted based on the main adsorption models langmuir eq 7 freundlich eq 9 d r eq 10 and temkin eq 12 50 table 2 the linear regression values refer that both freundlich and d r models are applicable to describe ag au qds removal process table 2 with the highest r2 values 0 928 and 0 905 in case of freundlich model as well as 0 926 and 0 902 for d r model in case of freundlich model a heterogeneous adsorption process was assumed with n values less than unity 0 278 for ag qds and 0 306 for au qds referring to a cooperative adsorption process that depends on the concentration of the adsorbate species 51 this is matching with the experimental results that showed an increase in the removal efficiencies with increasing metal qds concentrations this behavior confirms the applicability of freundlich model assuming a heterogeneous nanosorbent containing active functional groups with distinct binding energies together with adsorbate species interacting with each other 52 on the other hand the low free energy e values proposed in case of d r model 0 046 kj mol 1 for ag qds and 0 051 kj mol 1 for au qds are not compatible with a chemisorption adsorption process previously concluded from the kinetic studies additionally the small r2 values in case of langmuir model table 2 and temkin model together with the theoretical values computed from both models as qmax langmuir at temkin show the invalidity of both models in describing ag au qds removal mechanism onto the hydrogel 3 2 6 temperature effect and adsorption thermodynamics a study was performed to identify the thermodynamic parameters and the effect of reaction temperature on the interaction between metal qds and magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel the metal qds removal efficiency r was determined at temperatures ranging from 293 to 333 k it is evident that a decrease in ag au qds adsorption ability onto magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel from 95 68 to 84 98 and from 95 77 to 87 32 respectively was observed upon increasing the temperature from 293 to 333 k fig 7a additionally the van t hoff plot fig 7b confirms an exothermic adsorption process table 3 53 the computed thermodynamic parameters as the free energy change δg eq 13 enthalpy change δh and entropy change δs eq 15 were concluded for further interpretation of the coagulative adsorption mechanism table 3 process spontaneity was confirmed by the obtained negative δg while the exothermic nature of the coagulative adsorption process was predicted in terms of the observed negative δh values moreover the negative δs values reveal additional ordering in the hydrogel induced by metal qds adsorption this reveals a satisfactory interaction process for adsorptive coagulation of ag au qds onto the hydrogel without any structural variation at the solid liquid interphase additionally the increase in the negative δg values upon elevating the temperatures indicates that the recovery of ag au qds become less favorable at higher temperature the calculated thermodynamic parameters can be used further to predict the physical or chemical nature of the adsorption process 54 for example the range of δg from 2 to 29 kj mol 1 refers to an adsorption process that is driven by chemical bonding interaction for ag au qds the calculated δg values ranging between 7 34 and 9 78 kj mol 1 ag qds 7 88 and 9 83 kj mol 1 au qds confirms a chemical interaction process between the metal qds and magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel 3 2 7 effect of medium ionic strength wastewater and industrial effluents usually contain a variety of ions that strongly affect the ionic strength of the medium in order to estimate the effect of ionic strength on the performance of magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel towards ag au qds removal capacity different concentrations of nacl as interfering salt 0 20 mm were applied in this study and the results are summarized in fig 8 it is evident that upon increasing nacl concentration from 0 to 20 mm a direct increase in ag au qds adsorption efficiencies from 95 43 to 98 29 and from 93 58 to 97 57 respectively was concluded this could be related to the fact that increasing solution s ionic strength using a strong electrolyte can strongly enhance the coagulation and adsorptive removal of ag au qds in lights of the classical dlvo theory 55 nacl is not only causing ag qds and au qds to aggregate but it also compresses the electric double layer of qds minimizing the diffusion layer and thereby speeding up the diffusion process and enabling the adsorptive coagulation and removal of metal qds 56 3 2 8 procedure evaluation on natural and industrial water resources drinking water seawater and real industrial effluents were collected and utilized to test the efficacy of magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel 100 mg in metal qds removal using 30 min reaction the initial visual observation following metal qds coagulative removal was related to the sample color change from colored grey yellow red into colorless in case of ag au qds respectively this suggests that metal qds were recovered from the medium by adsorption onto the hydrogel the percentage recovery values of drinking water samples containing 30 mg l 1 of metal qds were 96 0 and 94 8 for ag and au subsequently seawater sample containing similar qds concentrations demonstrated larger recovery percentage as a result of the presence of high concentrations of ionic species as na k cl i ca2 and mg2 and which are known to increase the solution ionic strength 16 as a result the removal efficiencies for both metal qds were maximized to 99 0 furthermore the removal of metal qds from industrial wastewater samples yielded satisfactory removal efficiencies of 91 0 for ag qds and 90 0 for au qds these findings support the viability of the devised removal technique for ag au qds on industrial wastewater by the assembled magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel 3 2 9 regeneration and reusability of magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel the most important step in evaluating magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel as a potential nanosorbent from removal of ag and au qd from industrial scale is based on the evaluation of its reusability the possible desorption of ag au qds from the hydrogel and its reutilization in further recovery cycles was investigated subsequent washings with hcl 0 1 m were efficient to release metal qds fig 3s supplementary information depicts the removal efficiencies of the hydrogel during five successive adsorption desorption cycles the removal efficiencies of metal qds after the first regeneration cycle using 50 mg l 1 ag au qds were found 94 6 and 95 8 respectively after the fifth regeneration cycle there were 3 5 and 4 5 drop by providing removal efficiency values 91 3 and 91 5 for ag au qds respectively this validates the process s high efficiency in terms of nanosorbent reusability and ability to recycle noble metal qds from industrial effluent 3 3 microwave catalytic removal of doxorubicin using adsorbed ag au qds onto magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel catalytic and photocatalytic degradation processes of organic and inorganic pollutants have been widely applied in water treatment using various techniques by a variety of catalysts biocatalysts and nanocatalysts as recently reported 56 64 ag au qds contaminants recovered by adsorption onto the hydrogel nanosorbent were introduced and applied as competitive heterogeneous catalysts via microwave catalytic removal of doxorubicin dox a common chemotherapy medication used for treating several types of carcinogenic tumors breast cancer bladder cancer and leukemia 65 this environmentally friendly and sustainable chemical approach was investigated by taking into account a variety of parameters such as microwave power kps amount ph and ionic strength fig 9 depicts the degradation efficiency and kinetics of dox on various catalysts where c0 is the initial dox absorbance at maximum wavelength λmax while ct is the absorbance at different time intervals by comparison with the ps results it is clear that ag au qds alone can t compete with ps as catalysts by producing only 14 13 and 13 70 dox removal after 9 min respectively compared to ps s 41 11 removal the combined metal qds hydrogel recovered catalysts on the other hand yielded very interesting results with dox removal percentages reaching to 93 15 and 96 68 during the same reaction period and using the adsorbed ag au qds on the hydrogels subsequently this is probably because of the formation of hot spots on metal qds as a result of microwave irradiation that are capable of decomposing kps into sulfate radical anions so 4 sulfate radicals can even interact with water molecules to produce other radical species such as hydroxyl radicals oh 66 both radical species formed are strong oxidizing agents that can initiate the oxidative degradation of dox molecules 67 69 3 3 1 kinetic study for microwave catalytic removal of doxorubicin considering the excess concentration of kps dox degradation reaction was expected to proceed via a pseudo first order kinetics eq 16 fig 9 shows that the catalytic process using both metal qds were best fitted with the pseudo first order kinetic model with r2 values of 0 99 0 98 and first order rate constants of 0 3022 min 1 0 3620 min 1 for ag au qds subsequently several parameters influencing the catalytic activity microwave power ph kps o and ionic strength were also taken into account fig 10 shows the constructive effect of microwave power on the catalytic activity for both metals in particular rate constants of 0 172 min 1 to 0 295 min 1 and finally to 0 442 min 1 were observed upon using ag qds based catalyst with microwave irradiation of 180 300 and 450 watt respectively similar trend was observed for au qds based catalyst with rate constant values of 0 295 min 1 0 362 min 1 and 0 713 min 1 subsequently increasing the amount of kps also caused an enhancement in the catalytic activity of both catalysts fig 11 for example increasing the kps quantity 5 ml 7 ml and 9 ml enhanced the degradation process rate constants of 0 263 min 1 0 302 min 1 0 362 min 1 subsequently for ag qds and 0 265 min 1 0 362 min 1 0 465 min 1 for au qds it was concluded that the catalytic performance was not much affected by ionic strength of reaction solution fig 12 for example when 10 mm nacl was added the dox removal rate constant increased slightly reaching 0 408 min 1 in the case of ag qds and 0 420 min 1 in the case of au qds compared to the rate constant values in the absence of nacl 0 3022 min 1 0 3620 min 1respectively however further nacl additions did not cause a significant increase in the removal efficiency the ph of solution is one last factor to be investigated the results fig 13 for both metal qds demonstrate that in contrast to neutral and acidic conditions alkaline medium favored the dox catalytic degradation reaction low catalytic rate constant values at acidic ph values could be attributed to ag and au atoms leaching from the catalyst surface into the solution however in basic conditions ag au qds can serve as heterogeneous catalysts only if the possible oxidation of ag was avoided 70 this situation would be favored if metal qds were integrated in composite material providing sufficient oxygen storage capability such as the magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel system this is mainly related to the dual redox cycle that can maintain the catalytic performance 71 in order to assess applicability of the investigated two nanocatalysts on an industrial scale catalyst recyclability and reusability were examined by five successive cycles involving catalytic dox degradation followed by nanocatalyst regeneration fig 14 as seen the nanocatalyst performance was not severely affected after 5 successive cycles only 4 70 drop in the catalytic degradation performance in case of adsorbed au qds based catalyst and 7 44 drop in case of adsorbed ag qds based catalyst this highlights the possibility to use ag qds au qds magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel nanocatalysts in real industrial applications 4 conclusion magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel was synthesized by the chemical synthesis of magcof and followed by incorporating into aminated agar fava bean peels biochar hydrogel using borax crosslinker the chemical structure of magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel was identified using several techniques such as sem eds ft ir xrd and xps before being applied to recover ag and au qds from wastewater high removal values r 97 6 and 100 were confirmed for ag and au qds subsequently at the concluded optimum conditions 10 mg hydrogel ph 5 298 k and 30 min shaking a chemical adsorption process was predicted and found to fit well with the pseudo second order kinetic model furthermore thermodynamic studies referred to the spontaneity of the exothermic adsorption process as favored at lower temperature trials on real collected wastewater samples showed that the developed process is applicable on industrial scale with ag qds and au qds removal percentages reaching 91 0 and 90 0 respectively as a green chemical approach recovered and adsorbed metal qds onto magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel were effectively reused as heterogeneous nanocatalysts using microwave degradation of dox drug in presence of kps the two metal qds nanocatalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activities towards dox degradation reaching 93 15 and 96 68 for ag and au based catalysts respectively after only 9 min at standard conditions 180 w vkps 7 ml dox 0 50 mg l 1 and catalyst mass 5 mg both heterogeneous nanocatalysts were reusable over 5 successive catalytic cycles with only 7 44 and 4 70 drop in the catalytic degradation performance by ag and au based catalysts respectively the developed and investigated magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel was found to afford several advantages which are mainly related to the excellent reactivity towards effective adsorptive binding with both ag qds and au qds in terms of dosage reaction time and working ph range in addition the process applicability and reusability of the developed hydrogel material confirmed retaining good activities towards ag qds and au qds after 5 successive adsorption regeneration cycles with only 3 5 and 4 5 drop in their activity respectively the sustainability in this work is directly based on the successful implementation of deposited qds onto magcof aminated agar fbp biochar nanocatalyst in reductive degradation of dox drug as an example of organic pollutants declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

application and implementation of nanomaterials in a variety of disciplines 1 as a result nanoparticles have been used in several industrial and medical applications together with several environmental activities this caused a significant increase in the discharged amounts of nanomaterials as emergent contaminants into the ecosystem particularly wastewater 2 quantum dots qds are

removal of metal qds by magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel 3 2 1 ag au qds adsorption mechanism in general metal qds and nanoparticles removal mechanisms are complex as due to involvement of one or more of the following coagulative adsorption driving forces as chemical bonding hydrogen bonding ion exchange electrostatic interactions van der waals force hydrophobic attractions physical adsorption and aggregation 34 for ag and au qds adsorption on magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel nanosorbent hard soft acid base interaction could be a possible route between n atoms and ag au atoms to form metal ligand bonds 38 additionally coagulative adsorption mechanism could involve an electrostatic interaction between metal qds and the hydrogel via van der waal forces above all the huge and highly ordered porosity of the utilized substrate could be of great advantages in terms of surface area and exposed adsorption sites this assumption was confirmed by acquiring the surface area of magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel nanosorbent using bet method and found to correspond to 306 m2 g therefore magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel nanosorbent is expected to adsorb large amount of metal qds and it could be a competing candidate for their coagulative removal from wastewater 46 ag au qds removal through adsorption onto magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel nanosorbent can be affected by various parameters as the solution ph time of reaction quantity of magcof aminated agar fbp biochar initial metal qds dosage temperature and ionic strength 16 17 all these parameters are discussed in details in the upcoming paragraphs 3 2 2 effect of ph solution ph is an important parameter that can influence the electrostatic interaction between small metal nanoparticles and the sorbent to limit instability issues a ph range 5 11 was selected au and ag qds removal percentages fig 3a are almost steady in the ph range 5 10 with the highest value at ph 5 on the other hand removal percentage towards both metal qds were drastically droped at ph 11 the enhancement in au and ag qds adsorption of on magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel nanosorbent upon decreasing solution ph is related to the contribution of amino groups of the nanosorbent at lower ph values higher concentrations of h ions amino groups were protonated to form the corresponding positively charged ammonium cation this situation was identified to enhance the electrostatic interaction between the nanosorbent and the negatively charged particles at high ph values excess oh ions reverse the charge on the nanosorbent surface initiating repulsive forces between the similarly charged particles and nanosorbent 47 this prediction is supported by the observed hydrogel point of zero charge pzc values shown in fig 3b based on these findings the optimum ph value ph 5 was fixed for the rest of experiments 3 2 3 effect of magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel dosage on qds removal removal of metal qds was studied using nanosorbent dossage of various masses 1 30 mg the hydrogel mass was mixed with an aqueous qds solution 10 ml 50 mg l 1 through shaking 10 min for ag qds or 3 min for au qds at 298 k while maintaining the optimal solution at ph 5 as shown in fig 4 increasing the amount of hydrogel nanosorbent increased the efficiency of metal qds removal to reach 97 1 and 98 5 removal percentages at hydrogel dosage of 30 mg for ag au qds subsequently this trend is in good agreement with the increase in available adsorption sites with increasing the amount of the biosorbent 15 48 the fact that au qds removal percentage 98 5 at 30 mg hydrogel mass is higher than ag qds removal percentage may be due to au qds competitive ability to experience ion exchange interactions with the ions existing at the adsorbent surface 3 2 4 effect of shaking duration ag and au qds removal percentages were investigated by mixing magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel with an aqueous solution of qds 10 ml 50 mg l 1 and measuring the qds residual concentration at different time intervals it was observed that ag au qds removal reaches saturation after 30 min with related removal efficiencies of 97 6 and 100 respectively as shown in fig 5 metal qds removal kinetics was modeled by correlating the collected data with several kinetic models pseudo first order pseudo second order intraparticle diffusion and elvoich in lights of these studies a suitable adsorption mechanism of ag au qds onto the nanosorbent was proposed 49 the correlation coefficients r2 values summarized in table 1 indicates better fitting in case of pseudo second order model with r2 1 for the adsorptive removal of both metals 0 998 0 993 for ag and au subsequently additionally calculated qe values 121 95 mg g 1 for ag qds 125 00 mg g 1 for au qds fitted perfectly with those obtained experimentally 121 95 mg g 1 for ag qds 124 18 mg g 1 for au qds this result proposes an adsorption mechanism with a dominant chemisorption process 3 2 5 initial metal qds concentration effect and elucidation of adsorption isotherms fitting the experimental data with the main adsorption isotherms was considered to reveal the nature of sorbent adsorbent interaction and to correlate between the removal percentage and initial metal qds concentration under fixed temperature 298 k and ph 5 conditions an increase in the removal efficiency was observed upon increasing the initial metal qds concentration with maximum removal r 95 86 98 59 in case of 50 mg l 1 ag au qds subsequently fig 6 the experimental data were interpreted based on the main adsorption models langmuir eq 7 freundlich eq 9 d r eq 10 and temkin eq 12 50 table 2 the linear regression values refer that both freundlich and d r models are applicable to describe ag au qds removal process table 2 with the highest r2 values 0 928 and 0 905 in case of freundlich model as well as 0 926 and 0 902 for d r model in case of freundlich model a heterogeneous adsorption process was assumed with n values less than unity 0 278 for ag qds and 0 306 for au qds referring to a cooperative adsorption process that depends on the concentration of the adsorbate species 51 this is matching with the experimental results that showed an increase in the removal efficiencies with increasing metal qds concentrations this behavior confirms the applicability of freundlich model assuming a heterogeneous nanosorbent containing active functional groups with distinct binding energies together with adsorbate species interacting with each other 52 on the other hand the low free energy e values proposed in case of d r model 0 046 kj mol 1 for ag qds and 0 051 kj mol 1 for au qds are not compatible with a chemisorption adsorption process previously concluded from the kinetic studies additionally the small r2 values in case of langmuir model table 2 and temkin model together with the theoretical values computed from both models as qmax langmuir at temkin show the invalidity of both models in describing ag au qds removal mechanism onto the hydrogel 3 2 6 temperature effect and adsorption thermodynamics a study was performed to identify the thermodynamic parameters and the effect of reaction temperature on the interaction between metal qds and magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel the metal qds removal efficiency r was determined at temperatures ranging from 293 to 333 k it is evident that a decrease in ag au qds adsorption ability onto magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel from 95 68 to 84 98 and from 95 77 to 87 32 respectively was observed upon increasing the temperature from 293 to 333 k fig 7a additionally the van t hoff plot fig 7b confirms an exothermic adsorption process table 3 53 the computed thermodynamic parameters as the free energy change δg eq 13 enthalpy change δh and entropy change δs eq 15 were concluded for further interpretation of the coagulative adsorption mechanism table 3 process spontaneity was confirmed by the obtained negative δg while the exothermic nature of the coagulative adsorption process was predicted in terms of the observed negative δh values moreover the negative δs values reveal additional ordering in the hydrogel induced by metal qds adsorption this reveals a satisfactory interaction process for adsorptive coagulation of ag au qds onto the hydrogel without any structural variation at the solid liquid interphase additionally the increase in the negative δg values upon elevating the temperatures indicates that the recovery of ag au qds become less favorable at higher temperature the calculated thermodynamic parameters can be used further to predict the physical or chemical nature of the adsorption process 54 for example the range of δg from 2 to 29 kj mol 1 refers to an adsorption process that is driven by chemical bonding interaction for ag au qds the calculated δg values ranging between 7 34 and 9 78 kj mol 1 ag qds 7 88 and 9 83 kj mol 1 au qds confirms a chemical interaction process between the metal qds and magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel 3 2 7 effect of medium ionic strength wastewater and industrial effluents usually contain a variety of ions that strongly affect the ionic strength of the medium in order to estimate the effect of ionic strength on the performance of magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel towards ag au qds removal capacity different concentrations of nacl as interfering salt 0 20 mm were applied in this study and the results are summarized in fig 8 it is evident that upon increasing nacl concentration from 0 to 20 mm a direct increase in ag au qds adsorption efficiencies from 95 43 to 98 29 and from 93 58 to 97 57 respectively was concluded this could be related to the fact that increasing solution s ionic strength using a strong electrolyte can strongly enhance the coagulation and adsorptive removal of ag au qds in lights of the classical dlvo theory 55 nacl is not only causing ag qds and au qds to aggregate but it also compresses the electric double layer of qds minimizing the diffusion layer and thereby speeding up the diffusion process and enabling the adsorptive coagulation and removal of metal qds 56 3 2 8 procedure evaluation on natural and industrial water resources drinking water seawater and real industrial effluents were collected and utilized to test the efficacy of magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel 100 mg in metal qds removal using 30 min reaction the initial visual observation following metal qds coagulative removal was related to the sample color change from colored grey yellow red into colorless in case of ag au qds respectively this suggests that metal qds were recovered from the medium by adsorption onto the hydrogel the percentage recovery values of drinking water samples containing 30 mg l 1 of metal qds were 96 0 and 94 8 for ag and au subsequently seawater sample containing similar qds concentrations demonstrated larger recovery percentage as a result of the presence of high concentrations of ionic species as na k cl i ca2 and mg2 and which are known to increase the solution ionic strength 16 as a result the removal efficiencies for both metal qds were maximized to 99 0 furthermore the removal of metal qds from industrial wastewater samples yielded satisfactory removal efficiencies of 91 0 for ag qds and 90 0 for au qds these findings support the viability of the devised removal technique for ag au qds on industrial wastewater by the assembled magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel 3 2 9 regeneration and reusability of magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel the most important step in evaluating magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel as a potential nanosorbent from removal of ag and au qd from industrial scale is based on the evaluation of its reusability the possible desorption of ag au qds from the hydrogel and its reutilization in further recovery cycles was investigated subsequent washings with hcl 0 1 m were efficient to release metal qds fig 3s supplementary information depicts the removal efficiencies of the hydrogel during five successive adsorption desorption cycles the removal efficiencies of metal qds after the first regeneration cycle using 50 mg l 1 ag au qds were found 94 6 and 95 8 respectively after the fifth regeneration cycle there were 3 5 and 4 5 drop by providing removal efficiency values 91 3 and 91 5 for ag au qds respectively this validates the process s high efficiency in terms of nanosorbent reusability and ability to recycle noble metal qds from industrial effluent 3 3 microwave catalytic removal of doxorubicin using adsorbed ag au qds onto magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel catalytic and photocatalytic degradation processes of organic and inorganic pollutants have been widely applied in water treatment using various techniques by a variety of catalysts biocatalysts and nanocatalysts as recently reported 56 64 ag au qds contaminants recovered by adsorption onto the hydrogel nanosorbent were introduced and applied as competitive heterogeneous catalysts via microwave catalytic removal of doxorubicin dox a common chemotherapy medication used for treating several types of carcinogenic tumors breast cancer bladder cancer and leukemia 65 this environmentally friendly and sustainable chemical approach was investigated by taking into account a variety of parameters such as microwave power kps amount ph and ionic strength fig 9 depicts the degradation efficiency and kinetics of dox on various catalysts where c0 is the initial dox absorbance at maximum wavelength λmax while ct is the absorbance at different time intervals by comparison with the ps results it is clear that ag au qds alone can t compete with ps as catalysts by producing only 14 13 and 13 70 dox removal after 9 min respectively compared to ps s 41 11 removal the combined metal qds hydrogel recovered catalysts on the other hand yielded very interesting results with dox removal percentages reaching to 93 15 and 96 68 during the same reaction period and using the adsorbed ag au qds on the hydrogels subsequently this is probably because of the formation of hot spots on metal qds as a result of microwave irradiation that are capable of decomposing kps into sulfate radical anions so 4 sulfate radicals can even interact with water molecules to produce other radical species such as hydroxyl radicals oh 66 both radical species formed are strong oxidizing agents that can initiate the oxidative degradation of dox molecules 67 69 3 3 1 kinetic study for microwave catalytic removal of doxorubicin considering the excess concentration of kps dox degradation reaction was expected to proceed via a pseudo first order kinetics eq 16 fig 9 shows that the catalytic process using both metal qds were best fitted with the pseudo first order kinetic model with r2 values of 0 99 0 98 and first order rate constants of 0 3022 min 1 0 3620 min 1 for ag au qds subsequently several parameters influencing the catalytic activity microwave power ph kps o and ionic strength were also taken into account fig 10 shows the constructive effect of microwave power on the catalytic activity for both metals in particular rate constants of 0 172 min 1 to 0 295 min 1 and finally to 0 442 min 1 were observed upon using ag qds based catalyst with microwave irradiation of 180 300 and 450 watt respectively similar trend was observed for au qds based catalyst with rate constant values of 0 295 min 1 0 362 min 1 and 0 713 min 1 subsequently increasing the amount of kps also caused an enhancement in the catalytic activity of both catalysts fig 11 for example increasing the kps quantity 5 ml 7 ml and 9 ml enhanced the degradation process rate constants of 0 263 min 1 0 302 min 1 0 362 min 1 subsequently for ag qds and 0 265 min 1 0 362 min 1 0 465 min 1 for au qds it was concluded that the catalytic performance was not much affected by ionic strength of reaction solution fig 12 for example when 10 mm nacl was added the dox removal rate constant increased slightly reaching 0 408 min 1 in the case of ag qds and 0 420 min 1 in the case of au qds compared to the rate constant values in the absence of nacl 0 3022 min 1 0 3620 min 1respectively however further nacl additions did not cause a significant increase in the removal efficiency the ph of solution is one last factor to be investigated the results fig 13 for both metal qds demonstrate that in contrast to neutral and acidic conditions alkaline medium favored the dox catalytic degradation reaction low catalytic rate constant values at acidic ph values could be attributed to ag and au atoms leaching from the catalyst surface into the solution however in basic conditions ag au qds can serve as heterogeneous catalysts only if the possible oxidation of ag was avoided 70 this situation would be favored if metal qds were integrated in composite material providing sufficient oxygen storage capability such as the magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel system this is mainly related to the dual redox cycle that can maintain the catalytic performance 71 in order to assess applicability of the investigated two nanocatalysts on an industrial scale catalyst recyclability and reusability were examined by five successive cycles involving catalytic dox degradation followed by nanocatalyst regeneration fig 14 as seen the nanocatalyst performance was not severely affected after 5 successive cycles only 4 70 drop in the catalytic degradation performance in case of adsorbed au qds based catalyst and 7 44 drop in case of adsorbed ag qds based catalyst this highlights the possibility to use ag qds au qds magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel nanocatalysts in real industrial applications 4 conclusion magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel was synthesized by the chemical synthesis of magcof and followed by incorporating into aminated agar fava bean peels biochar hydrogel using borax crosslinker the chemical structure of magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel was identified using several techniques such as sem eds ft ir xrd and xps before being applied to recover ag and au qds from wastewater high removal values r 97 6 and 100 were confirmed for ag and au qds subsequently at the concluded optimum conditions 10 mg hydrogel ph 5 298 k and 30 min shaking a chemical adsorption process was predicted and found to fit well with the pseudo second order kinetic model furthermore thermodynamic studies referred to the spontaneity of the exothermic adsorption process as favored at lower temperature trials on real collected wastewater samples showed that the developed process is applicable on industrial scale with ag qds and au qds removal percentages reaching 91 0 and 90 0 respectively as a green chemical approach recovered and adsorbed metal qds onto magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel were effectively reused as heterogeneous nanocatalysts using microwave degradation of dox drug in presence of kps the two metal qds nanocatalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activities towards dox degradation reaching 93 15 and 96 68 for ag and au based catalysts respectively after only 9 min at standard conditions 180 w vkps 7 ml dox 0 50 mg l 1 and catalyst mass 5 mg both heterogeneous nanocatalysts were reusable over 5 successive catalytic cycles with only 7 44 and 4 70 drop in the catalytic degradation performance by ag and au based catalysts respectively the developed and investigated magcof aminated agar fbp biochar hydrogel was found to afford several advantages which are mainly related to the excellent reactivity towards effective adsorptive binding with both ag qds and au qds in terms of dosage reaction time and working ph range in addition the process applicability and reusability of the developed hydrogel material confirmed retaining good activities towards ag qds and au qds after 5 successive adsorption regeneration cycles with only 3 5 and 4 5 drop in their activity respectively the sustainability in this work is directly based on the successful implementation of deposited qds onto magcof aminated agar fbp biochar nanocatalyst in reductive degradation of dox drug as an example of organic pollutants declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

12671,the use of constructed wetlands cws has become increasingly popular in pollutant removal in combined sewer overflows while the performance in dealing with odor compounds in cws has remained an open question in this study tidal flow wetland tw iron carbon wetland iw and tidal flow iron carbon wetland tiw were parallel constructed where novel substrates modified with iron carbon and different hydrodynamics in optimizing removal efficiency were compared the degradation kinetics of geosmin gsm a typical kind of odor compounds were selected to indicate the removal efficiency the biological features in different constructed wetlands were investigated in terms of microbial community distribution functional genes and metabolic pathways in contrast to tw iw and tiw exhibited enhanced performance in degrading of gsm at the steady stage 19 74 and 23 19 of the gsm was removed in a 24 h cycle for iw and tiw respectively the degradation process followed the pseudo first order kinetics cyanobacteria which produced gsm as parts of their metabolites and flavobacterium and sphingomonas which acted as the degrader on the other hand together contributed to the variation of gsm concentration in the constructed wetlands the adding of iron carbon in the substrates increased the abundance of flavobacterium and sphingomonas while decreased the growth of cyanobacteria and weakened the biosynthetic pathway of terpenoids tidal flow further enhanced the aerobic environment of the wetland and stimulates the metabolic activities of microorganisms therefore enhanced the pathway of metabolism and degradation of odor compounds consequently such combination further favored the degradation of gsm and the final removal efficiency graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords geosmin gsm constructed wetland tidal flow iron carbon micro electrolysis metabolic pathway data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction combined sewer overflows csos as one of the main sources of exogenous pollutants discharged into the urban water environments have raised an increasing concern in the recent decades when the intensity of the rainfall exceeds its designed standard the runoff can carry a large number of pollutants contained in the surficial sediments of the soil bed and the sediments deposited at the bottom of the pipeline this process may pose potential risk to the aquatic environment among all the pollutants odor compounds are one of the main components in the overflow sewage that are responsible to the black water which decrease the transparency deteriorate the water quality and do harm to both the living environment and the mental health of human beings 1 geosmin gsm as one of the most typical odor compounds shows a strong sensory impacts and is easy to be detected i e with only 5 ng l 1 as the threshold 2 but difficult to be degraded researchers in tokyo japan reported the possible existence of odor compounds observed in field sampling taken from kanda river which was contaminated by csos 3 our team found that gsm concentration can range from 30 1 to 46 8 μg l 1 in csos through our previous study relevant studies show that the gsm concentration in north han river korea exceeded 200 ng l 1 in summer 4 in eagle creek reservoir indiana usa the gsm concentration with a maximum of 77 3 ng l 1 was observed from june to august 5 the high level of gsm contain has become a main challenge to the treatment of urban black and odorous water constructed wetlands cws has become world widely popular as a water treatment technology in the urban areas due to their environmental friendly features limited impact on the surrounding environments during construction and good operating performance low cost practical treatment efficiency and easy maintenance the application of cws has been taken as the main treatment unit for overflow pollution control in some developed countries in europe and north america 6 data showed that the removal efficiency of total suspended solids tss and chemical oxygen demand cod in the road runoff by constructed wetlands reached 91 and 95 respectively 7 however traditional cws often presented low hydraulic load and removal rate to solve these problems pioneering attempts have been made such as developing new substrate 8 optimizing hydrodynamics and operation mode 9 building multiple integrated constructed wetlands 10 for instance the dry wet hydrodynamic mode mimicking natural tidal flow was reported to enhance the oxygen transmission capacity and utilization rate 11 the application of iron carbon substrate can enhance the removal efficiency of conventional pollutants 12 the mechanism is based on the iron carbon battery primary where the electron transfer is enhanced in oxidation reduction process and the promotion of precipitation of phosphate by iron ion occurring at the anode 13 the known breadth of enhanced constructed wetlands using new substrate materials has continued to expand meanwhile changing flow conditions is now understood to effectively improve the decontamination effect on conventional pollutants however the effects of removing odor compounds study in cws are still unclear whether enhancement of the substrate or other integration methods can improve the performance in dealing with odor compounds in cws has remained an open question therefore the question to be examined in this study is that whether the synergy of tidal flow and iron carbon can improve the removal of odorants through enhancing the degradation of refractory organic substances and screening microorganisms to answer this question this study aimed to investigate a novel integrated method where the substrate was modified with iron carbon and combined with the tidal flow mode as the hydrodynamic load termed as tidal flow iron carbon wetland tiw taking the typical odor compound gsm in the overflow sewage of the drainage system in nanjing south china as the removal object the removal efficiency in the newly established system was compared with that in the conventional tidal flow wetland tw and iron carbon wetland iw multiple analyses involving degradation kinetics microbial community gene and predicted metabolic pathways were employed to interpret why the proposed tiw system in this study performed better in degrading gsm 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setups three parallel experiments were carried out in this study where different cws were investigated fig 1 each flume contained an identical tank unit for water circulation and a wetland unit different treatments the effective volume of the tank was 40 l the size of the wetland unit was the same 0 40 m 0 30 m 0 3 m the thickness of the substrate was 0 25 m for each constructed wetland on which vegetation acorus calamus was planted in a density of 10 plants m 2 the water was pumped from the bottom of the water tank into the upper wetland unit the water level in each wetland unit was kept the same the operating parameters in different wetland settings are shown in table 1 the substrate in tiw tiw was a mixture of pea gravels added with iron carbon 10 pea gravel is a kind of widely used substrate material for constructed wetlands 14 15 the half wet half dry mode i e 12 h of hydraulic retention time in total per day was selected as the experimental settings in this study and in previous studies 16 however it should be noted that the operation mode may also lead to different behavior of the system therefore the results observed in this study should be viewed with caution of its limitation in contrast iw used the same substrate as tiw but a steady flow condition was adopted where the bed was always submerged through the whole running time the same tidal flow mode was set in tw but with no addition of iron carbon in the substrate of pea gravels tidal flow was created by regulating the inlet and outlet of the water the inoculum was concentrated aerobic sludge obtained from a municipal wastewater treatment plant of nanjing china following inoculation simulated wastewater was pumped into each reactor the composition of simulated wastewater was as follows glucose 200 mg l nh4cl 25 mg l kh2po4 5 mg l fecl3 6h2o 15 mg l cuso4 5h2o 0 3 mg l mncl2 4h2o 1 2 mg l znso4 7h2o 1 2 mg l 17 the stimulated wastewater in the reactor was renewed every 2 days biofilm could be observed after about 28 days when the cultivation of biofilm was accomplished after cultivation cso water collected from the overflow drainage of a combined drainage system in nanjing china was used to carry out the experiment the properties of the influent cso water were examined before the experiments table 2 2 2 experimental procedure the water used in the experiments was replaced every operation cycle 24 h samples were taken every 4 days from the inlet and outlet in each system 100 ml for each time respectively for further examination the concentration of the targeted typical odor compound geosmin gsm along with ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and total phosphorus tp was analyzed for the inlet and outlet respectively and based on which the removal efficiency was obtained each sample was analyzed in triplicate it is worth noting that the 28 day period may not be enough to perfectly present the long term performance of the system however results from this study do reflect a unique characteristic of the removal behavior when the system finished its acclimation after 3 4 weeks of cultivation time 18 during which the removal rates of gsm variated within an acceptable range the reduction rate of nh3 n reached a level higher than 90 for all the three tests and the removal rates of tp was relatively steady this together indicated that the system was at its final stage of biofilm acclimation a 24 h of operation cycle was then selected at this stage and a time series of gsm value was obtained tested every 3 h from the water sampling of 50 ml per flume in addition the surficial sediments of the substates attached by microorganisms from the water column were sampled to analyze the microbial communities functional genes and metabolic pathways between different systems 2 3 analytical methods the determinations of nh3 n and tp were referred to the standard methods of apha 19 solid phase microextraction gas chromatography mass spectrometry spme gc ms was used to determine the odor compound 20 gsm was screened by the full scan mode and the concentration was determined by the selected ion monitor sim mode the microbial community structure analysis was determined via 16s rrna amplicon sequencing with which the microbial species and composition were identified biozeron shanghai china illumina pe250 was used for otu clustering and species annotation of the microbial samples the raw data can be accessed on ncbi accession prjna901649 id 901649 the software picrust phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states was utilized for metabolic function prediction of the bacterial community colonizing on cws picrust is a computational approach suitable for predicting the functional composition of a metagenome using marker gene such as the 16 s rrna gene of bacteria data and a database of reference genomes such as the popular kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg 21 3 results and discussion 3 1 nh3 n and tp removal efficiency the time evolution of nh3 n and tp concentration of influent and effluent with removal efficiency in tiw tw and iw is shown in fig 2 during the first 20 days the nh3 n removal efficiency in tiw and iw showed slow rise with an average of 91 48 and 90 91 respectively after 20 days tiw represented better ability to remove ammonia nitrogen 99 80 on day 28 than iw 96 15 on day 28 however ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency in tw was rather unstable which varied from 70 18 to 92 58 tiw with an average removal percentage of 89 80 showed a superior ability of reducing tp compared to the other two iw for 79 95 and tw for 71 07 tiw and iw showed good growth in removal capacity with an average of 97 84 and 86 74 on day 28 respectively while the removal efficiency of tw remained low 71 54 after 4 weeks of acclimation the three constructed wetlands showed different removal ability of the traditional pollutants represented by nh3 n and tp tiw showed great capacity for degrading both nh3 n and tp while iw was slightly weaker than the former compared to them tw was labile and less effective for the degradation of nh3 n when it had a stable but inefficient degradation ability over tp iron carbon played a role in traditional pollutants reduction iron ion and electrons that had high chemical activity could help to improve the electron transfer in the process of biological removal of nh3 n while activated carbon could adsorb nh3 n 22 and the iron ion along with the electrons would help remove tp 23 microbes adsorbed on the carbon would directly exchange electrons and energy between species 24 which conducted to nh3 n and tp removal in our wetlands nevertheless the removal efficiency of all the wetlands were much higher than other similar researches 16 25 26 the results implied that iron carbon was necessary to achieve a high removal rate while tidal flow would further round it out 3 2 gsm removal efficiency the gsm removal efficiency in each constructed wetland during 28 days was shown in fig 3 the gsm removal efficiency in tiw and iw gradually increased as the running days increased in tiw the final removal efficiency reached 22 81 23 19 in the last week 24 28 days of operation and remained stable while for iw the value fluctuated slightly within 20 28 days with an average value of 18 84 which was 5 lower than that in tiw in contrast tw was obviously less effective in removing gsm results showed that the concentration of gsm in the effluent of tw even increased after 20 days of operation indicating that the system produced more gsm rather than degrading it traditional surface flow or subsurface flow constructed wetlands perform poorly in removing gsm results from this study demonstrated that although tidal flow enhanced the oxygen mass transfer in the constructed wetlands creating an aerobic environment which ought to stimulate aerobic microorganisms to degrade more organic matters as previously thought 27 whereas the overall removal of gsm was not improved tw in our study after integrated with iron carbon modified substrate the removal efficiency for gsm was greatly improved tiw the system with only iron carbon modified substrate no tidal flow iw still performed well in gsm removal 5 less in efficiency than tiw 3 3 gsm degradation kinetics to further reveal the effect of different substrates and hydrodynamic conditions on the removal of gsm a full operation cycle 24 h was studied on day 28 the gsm removal efficiency and the kinetics of the degradation of gsm in different runs was compared in detail fig 4 tiw showed the best performance in removing gsm in the 24 h cycle while tw was the least among the three fig 4a the gsm concentration in tiw decreased from 33 89 ng l 1 to a final value of 26 03 ng l 1 with a removal efficiency of 23 19 the gsm concentration in iw changed from 34 99 ng l 1 to 28 08 ng l 1 of which the removal efficiency decreased to 19 74 compared with tiw the gsm concentration in tw showed limited variation 35 01 ng l 1 vs 33 89 ng l 1 with a removal efficiency of only 3 19 a time series of gsm concentration was presented in fig 4b which provided more details of how the concentration changed within a single cycle in short term gsm removal effects under different conditions were similar at the beginning indicated by the three lines overlapping each other in the first 3 h after that tiw performed obviously better than iw while the gsm concentration in tw gradually increased showing an opposite effect in removing gsm kinetics analysis was applied to study the process of gsm removal in tiw and iw indicating that the process was well described by the pseudo first order reaction kinetics r adjust 2 was 0 98871 and 0 9584 respectively the result was consistent with the research of gsm biodegradation by ho heofel et al 28 29 the reaction rate constants of tiw and iw were 0 078 d 1 r2 0 96 and 0 053 d 1 r2 0 97 respectively of which the degradation rate of tiw was higher after modified with iron carbon the gsm removal in tiw and iw followed the pseudo first order reaction kinetics which was quite different from the process occurring in tw without iron carbon modification this indicated that gsm in the iron carbon modified system was effectively biodegraded the reaction rate constant k in tiw was over 50 higher than that in iw and the degradation rate in tiw was higher the biological gsm removal efficiency in constructed wetland was related to the change of functional microbial community which was caused by the change of wetland microenvironment due to the addition of iron carbon substrate and the operation of tidal flow the combination of tidal flow and iron carbon modification in the substrate resulted in a higher species richness and diversity 3 4 microbial community the microbial community in tiw showed the highest chao index and shannon index chao 1040 shannon 5 19 along with the lowest simpson index 0 0178 table 3 in contrast the chao index and shannon index for the tw was much lower chao 980 shannon 4 83 compared to the values for tiw and iw this means that adding of iron carbon in the substrate largely increased the species richness and diversity microorganisms play an important role in the degradation and production of odor substances gsm is a kind of terpenoid odor substance with structure similar to biodegradable alicyclic alcohols and ketones which certain types of microorganisms such as flavobacterium and pseudomonas

degrade gsm and pseudomonas can use odor substances as a carbon source 5 ho et al proved that some species of pseudomonas and sphingomonas pseudomonas sp sphingomonas sp can also degrade gsm 28 on the

all the three cws while the relative abundance of acidobacteria in iw was twice higher than that in tiw or tw this is because an iron rich condition favored the growth of acidobacteria 32 as acidobacteria use iron ions as electron acceptors for iron reduction iron carbon substrates provide a better environment however the tidal flow mode showed a negative effect on the production of acidobacteria on the one hand low dissolved oxygen content supported an acidic environment in the submerged flow system on the other hand the absence of tidal flow disturbance in the submerged flow

both tiw and iw was significantly lower than that without iron carbon substrate tw which indicated that iron carbon substrate inhibited the present of cyanobacteria the enrichment of cyanobacteria increased the production of gsm while other microorganisms degraded gsm simultaneously although there were quite abundant bacteria degrading gsm in tw cyanobacteria as the gsm producer played such an important role that consequently the gsm removal ability was significantly weaker than that in tiw and iw analysis at the genus level showed that in tiw iw and tw fig 5 and table 4 the relative

iron carbon substrate was more beneficial to the growth of flavobacterium the abundance of some species of cyanobacteria which can produce odor substances as metabolites in tw was much higher than that of tiw and iw generally for example the abundance of leptolyngbya in tw 5 27 was even 8 9 times higher than in tiw 0 58 and iw 0 50 sphingomonas are mostly aerobic or facultative anaerobes so the aerobic environment caused by tidal flow and its oxygen enrichment in tiw and tw became more suitable for their growth and their relative abundance was higher which was related to the specific aerobic characteristics of sphingomonas iron is an essential nutrient element for aerobic microorganisms high iron content may promote the microbial metabolism process which explained the relative abundance of sphingomonas in tiw was 17 higher than in tw thus improving the microbial degradation of gsm the abundance of several cyanobacteria of different genera producing odor substances in tw is generally much higher than that in tiw and iw since there was no iron carbon substrate in tw alone it can safely come to the conclusion that iron carbon substrate might be inhibiting the growth of cyanobacteria

12671,the use of constructed wetlands cws has become increasingly popular in pollutant removal in combined sewer overflows while the performance in dealing with odor compounds in cws has remained an open question in this study tidal flow wetland tw iron carbon wetland iw and tidal flow iron carbon wetland tiw were parallel constructed where novel substrates modified with iron carbon and different hydrodynamics in optimizing removal efficiency were compared the degradation kinetics of geosmin gsm a typical kind of odor compounds were selected to indicate the removal efficiency the biological features in different constructed wetlands were investigated in terms of microbial community distribution functional genes and metabolic pathways in contrast to tw iw and tiw exhibited enhanced performance in degrading of gsm at the steady stage 19 74 and 23 19 of the gsm was removed in a 24 h cycle for iw and tiw respectively the degradation process followed the pseudo first order kinetics cyanobacteria which produced gsm as parts of their metabolites and flavobacterium and sphingomonas which acted as the degrader on the other hand together contributed to the variation of gsm concentration in the constructed wetlands the adding of iron carbon in the substrates increased the abundance of flavobacterium and sphingomonas while decreased the growth of cyanobacteria and weakened the biosynthetic pathway of terpenoids tidal flow further enhanced the aerobic environment of the wetland and stimulates the metabolic activities of microorganisms therefore enhanced the pathway of metabolism and degradation of odor compounds consequently such combination further favored the degradation of gsm and the final removal efficiency graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords geosmin gsm constructed wetland tidal flow iron carbon micro electrolysis metabolic pathway data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction combined sewer overflows csos as one of the main sources of exogenous pollutants discharged into the urban water environments have raised an increasing concern in the recent decades when the intensity of the rainfall exceeds its designed standard the runoff can carry a large number of pollutants contained in the surficial sediments of the soil bed and the sediments deposited at the bottom of the pipeline this process may pose potential risk to the aquatic environment among all the pollutants odor compounds are one of the main components in the overflow sewage that are responsible to the black water which decrease the transparency deteriorate the water quality and do harm to both the living environment and the mental health of human beings 1 geosmin gsm as one of the most typical odor compounds shows a strong sensory impacts and is easy to be detected i e with only 5 ng l 1 as the threshold 2 but difficult to be degraded researchers in tokyo japan reported the possible existence of odor compounds observed in field sampling taken from kanda river which was contaminated by csos 3 our team found that gsm concentration can range from 30 1 to 46 8 μg l 1 in csos through our previous study relevant studies show that the gsm concentration in north han river korea exceeded 200 ng l 1 in summer 4 in eagle creek reservoir indiana usa the gsm concentration with a maximum of 77 3 ng l 1 was observed from june to august 5 the high level of gsm contain has become a main challenge to the treatment of urban black and odorous water constructed wetlands cws has become world widely popular as a water treatment technology in the urban areas due to their environmental friendly features limited impact on the surrounding environments during construction and good operating performance low cost practical treatment efficiency and easy maintenance the application of cws has been taken as the main treatment unit for overflow pollution control in some developed countries in europe and north america 6 data showed that the removal efficiency of total suspended solids tss and chemical oxygen demand cod in the road runoff by constructed wetlands reached 91 and 95 respectively 7 however traditional cws often presented low hydraulic load and removal rate to solve these problems pioneering attempts have been made such as developing new substrate 8 optimizing hydrodynamics and operation mode 9 building multiple integrated constructed wetlands 10 for instance the dry wet hydrodynamic mode mimicking natural tidal flow was reported to enhance the oxygen transmission capacity and utilization rate 11 the application of iron carbon substrate can enhance the removal efficiency of conventional pollutants 12 the mechanism is based on the iron carbon battery primary where the electron transfer is enhanced in oxidation reduction process and the promotion of precipitation of phosphate by iron ion occurring at the anode 13 the known breadth of enhanced constructed wetlands using new substrate materials has continued to expand meanwhile changing flow conditions is now understood to effectively improve the decontamination effect on conventional pollutants however the effects of removing odor compounds study in cws are still unclear whether enhancement of the substrate or other integration methods can improve the performance in dealing with odor compounds in cws has remained an open question therefore the question to be examined in this study is that whether the synergy of tidal flow and iron carbon can improve the removal of odorants through enhancing the degradation of refractory organic substances and screening microorganisms to answer this question this study aimed to investigate a novel integrated method where the substrate was modified with iron carbon and combined with the tidal flow mode as the hydrodynamic load termed as tidal flow iron carbon wetland tiw taking the typical odor compound gsm in the overflow sewage of the drainage system in nanjing south china as the removal object the removal efficiency in the newly established system was compared with that in the conventional tidal flow wetland tw and iron carbon wetland iw multiple analyses involving degradation kinetics microbial community gene and predicted metabolic pathways were employed to interpret why the proposed tiw system in this study performed better in degrading gsm 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setups three parallel experiments were carried out in this study where different cws were investigated fig 1 each flume contained an identical tank unit for water circulation and a wetland unit different treatments the effective volume of the tank was 40 l the size of the wetland unit was the same 0 40 m 0 30 m 0 3 m the thickness of the substrate was 0 25 m for each constructed wetland on which vegetation acorus calamus was planted in a density of 10 plants m 2 the water was pumped from the bottom of the water tank into the upper wetland unit the water level in each wetland unit was kept the same the operating parameters in different wetland settings are shown in table 1 the substrate in tiw tiw was a mixture of pea gravels added with iron carbon 10 pea gravel is a kind of widely used substrate material for constructed wetlands 14 15 the half wet half dry mode i e 12 h of hydraulic retention time in total per day was selected as the experimental settings in this study and in previous studies 16 however it should be noted that the operation mode may also lead to different behavior of the system therefore the results observed in this study should be viewed with caution of its limitation in contrast iw used the same substrate as tiw but a steady flow condition was adopted where the bed was always submerged through the whole running time the same tidal flow mode was set in tw but with no addition of iron carbon in the substrate of pea gravels tidal flow was created by regulating the inlet and outlet of the water the inoculum was concentrated aerobic sludge obtained from a municipal wastewater treatment plant of nanjing china following inoculation simulated wastewater was pumped into each reactor the composition of simulated wastewater was as follows glucose 200 mg l nh4cl 25 mg l kh2po4 5 mg l fecl3 6h2o 15 mg l cuso4 5h2o 0 3 mg l mncl2 4h2o 1 2 mg l znso4 7h2o 1 2 mg l 17 the stimulated wastewater in the reactor was renewed every 2 days biofilm could be observed after about 28 days when the cultivation of biofilm was accomplished after cultivation cso water collected from the overflow drainage of a combined drainage system in nanjing china was used to carry out the experiment the properties of the influent cso water were examined before the experiments table 2 2 2 experimental procedure the water used in the experiments was replaced every operation cycle 24 h samples were taken every 4 days from the inlet and outlet in each system 100 ml for each time respectively for further examination the concentration of the targeted typical odor compound geosmin gsm along with ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and total phosphorus tp was analyzed for the inlet and outlet respectively and based on which the removal efficiency was obtained each sample was analyzed in triplicate it is worth noting that the 28 day period may not be enough to perfectly present the long term performance of the system however results from this study do reflect a unique characteristic of the removal behavior when the system finished its acclimation after 3 4 weeks of cultivation time 18 during which the removal rates of gsm variated within an acceptable range the reduction rate of nh3 n reached a level higher than 90 for all the three tests and the removal rates of tp was relatively steady this together indicated that the system was at its final stage of biofilm acclimation a 24 h of operation cycle was then selected at this stage and a time series of gsm value was obtained tested every 3 h from the water sampling of 50 ml per flume in addition the surficial sediments of the substates attached by microorganisms from the water column were sampled to analyze the microbial communities functional genes and metabolic pathways between different systems 2 3 analytical methods the determinations of nh3 n and tp were referred to the standard methods of apha 19 solid phase microextraction gas chromatography mass spectrometry spme gc ms was used to determine the odor compound 20 gsm was screened by the full scan mode and the concentration was determined by the selected ion monitor sim mode the microbial community structure analysis was determined via 16s rrna amplicon sequencing with which the microbial species and composition were identified biozeron shanghai china illumina pe250 was used for otu clustering and species annotation of the microbial samples the raw data can be accessed on ncbi accession prjna901649 id 901649 the software picrust phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states was utilized for metabolic function prediction of the bacterial community colonizing on cws picrust is a computational approach suitable for predicting the functional composition of a metagenome using marker gene such as the 16 s rrna gene of bacteria data and a database of reference genomes such as the popular kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg 21 3 results and discussion 3 1 nh3 n and tp removal efficiency the time evolution of nh3 n and tp concentration of influent and effluent with removal efficiency in tiw tw and iw is shown in fig 2 during the first 20 days the nh3 n removal efficiency in tiw and iw showed slow rise with an average of 91 48 and 90 91 respectively after 20 days tiw represented better ability to remove ammonia nitrogen 99 80 on day 28 than iw 96 15 on day 28 however ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency in tw was rather unstable which varied from 70 18 to 92 58 tiw with an average removal percentage of 89 80 showed a superior ability of reducing tp compared to the other two iw for 79 95 and tw for 71 07 tiw and iw showed good growth in removal capacity with an average of 97 84 and 86 74 on day 28 respectively while the removal efficiency of tw remained low 71 54 after 4 weeks of acclimation the three constructed wetlands showed different removal ability of the traditional pollutants represented by nh3 n and tp tiw showed great capacity for degrading both nh3 n and tp while iw was slightly weaker than the former compared to them tw was labile and less effective for the degradation of nh3 n when it had a stable but inefficient degradation ability over tp iron carbon played a role in traditional pollutants reduction iron ion and electrons that had high chemical activity could help to improve the electron transfer in the process of biological removal of nh3 n while activated carbon could adsorb nh3 n 22 and the iron ion along with the electrons would help remove tp 23 microbes adsorbed on the carbon would directly exchange electrons and energy between species 24 which conducted to nh3 n and tp removal in our wetlands nevertheless the removal efficiency of all the wetlands were much higher than other similar researches 16 25 26 the results implied that iron carbon was necessary to achieve a high removal rate while tidal flow would further round it out 3 2 gsm removal efficiency the gsm removal efficiency in each constructed wetland during 28 days was shown in fig 3 the gsm removal efficiency in tiw and iw gradually increased as the running days increased in tiw the final removal efficiency reached 22 81 23 19 in the last week 24 28 days of operation and remained stable while for iw the value fluctuated slightly within 20 28 days with an average value of 18 84 which was 5 lower than that in tiw in contrast tw was obviously less effective in removing gsm results showed that the concentration of gsm in the effluent of tw even increased after 20 days of operation indicating that the system produced more gsm rather than degrading it traditional surface flow or subsurface flow constructed wetlands perform poorly in removing gsm results from this study demonstrated that although tidal flow enhanced the oxygen mass transfer in the constructed wetlands creating an aerobic environment which ought to stimulate aerobic microorganisms to degrade more organic matters as previously thought 27 whereas the overall removal of gsm was not improved tw in our study after integrated with iron carbon modified substrate the removal efficiency for gsm was greatly improved tiw the system with only iron carbon modified substrate no tidal flow iw still performed well in gsm removal 5 less in efficiency than tiw 3 3 gsm degradation kinetics to further reveal the effect of different substrates and hydrodynamic conditions on the removal of gsm a full operation cycle 24 h was studied on day 28 the gsm removal efficiency and the kinetics of the degradation of gsm in different runs was compared in detail fig 4 tiw showed the best performance in removing gsm in the 24 h cycle while tw was the least among the three fig 4a the gsm concentration in tiw decreased from 33 89 ng l 1 to a final value of 26 03 ng l 1 with a removal efficiency of 23 19 the gsm concentration in iw changed from 34 99 ng l 1 to 28 08 ng l 1 of which the removal efficiency decreased to 19 74 compared with tiw the gsm concentration in tw showed limited variation 35 01 ng l 1 vs 33 89 ng l 1 with a removal efficiency of only 3 19 a time series of gsm concentration was presented in fig 4b which provided more details of how the concentration changed within a single cycle in short term gsm removal effects under different conditions were similar at the beginning indicated by the three lines overlapping each other in the first 3 h after that tiw performed obviously better than iw while the gsm concentration in tw gradually increased showing an opposite effect in removing gsm kinetics analysis was applied to study the process of gsm removal in tiw and iw indicating that the process was well described by the pseudo first order reaction kinetics r adjust 2 was 0 98871 and 0 9584 respectively the result was consistent with the research of gsm biodegradation by ho heofel et al 28 29 the reaction rate constants of tiw and iw were 0 078 d 1 r2 0 96 and 0 053 d 1 r2 0 97 respectively of which the degradation rate of tiw was higher after modified with iron carbon the gsm removal in tiw and iw followed the pseudo first order reaction kinetics which was quite different from the process occurring in tw without iron carbon modification this indicated that gsm in the iron carbon modified system was effectively biodegraded the reaction rate constant k in tiw was over 50 higher than that in iw and the degradation rate in tiw was higher the biological gsm removal efficiency in constructed wetland was related to the change of functional microbial community which was caused by the change of wetland microenvironment due to the addition of iron carbon substrate and the operation of tidal flow the combination of tidal flow and iron carbon modification in the substrate resulted in a higher species richness and diversity 3 4 microbial community the microbial community in tiw showed the highest chao index and shannon index chao 1040 shannon 5 19 along with the lowest simpson index 0 0178 table 3 in contrast the chao index and shannon index for the tw was much lower chao 980 shannon 4 83 compared to the values for tiw and iw this means that adding of iron carbon in the substrate largely increased the species richness and diversity microorganisms play an important role in the degradation and production of odor substances gsm is a kind of terpenoid odor substance with structure similar to biodegradable alicyclic alcohols and ketones which certain types of microorganisms such as flavobacterium and pseudomonas can effectively degrade 30 31 relevant studies have revealed that some strains of proteobacteria and acidobacteria showed the ability to degrade gsm 5 egashira et al found that flavobacterium can degrade gsm and pseudomonas can use odor substances as a carbon source 5 ho et al proved that some species of pseudomonas and sphingomonas pseudomonas sp sphingomonas sp can also degrade gsm 28 on the contrary leptolyngbya synechococcus chroococcidiopsis pleurocapsa and geitlerinema of cyanobacteria produce odor substances such as gsm through metabolism analysis of the microbial species abundance at the phylum level in the three wetlands showed that proteobacteria became dominant in all cases the relative abundance exceeded 50 fig 5 acidobacteria in iw shared a proportion of up to 22 while the relative abundance of acidobacteria in tiw and tw was 10 the relative abundance of cyanobacteria in tw was 16 40 significantly higher than that in tiw and iw 4 44 and 1 34 proteobacteria presented in all the three cws while the relative abundance of acidobacteria in iw was twice higher than that in tiw or tw this is because an iron rich condition favored the growth of acidobacteria 32 as

abundance of flavobacterium in tiw 28 14 and iw 41 16 was significantly higher than that in tw 15 55 sphingomonas was more dominant in tiw 27 16 followed by tw 19 54 and iw 7 97 the relative abundance of pseudomonas in tiw was 5 3 times and 8 3 times higher than that in iw and tw respectively the relative abundance of pseudomonas in tiw showed obvious advantages in our study this indicated that

suitable for microorganism growth the h2 mbfr was inoculated with 150 ml of suspended biomass from the enriched culture the reactor was run in a semi batch mode for 2 days until biomass could be observed visually on the membrane surface and the water in reactor became clear then continuous feeding began and involved four stages that had a total duration of 100 days the operating conditions for each stage are summarized in table 1 throughout the 100 days of continuous operation the influent no3 n was 10 mg l 1 and the ph in the influent was 7 0 0 5 during stage 1 the h2 mbfr was fed continuously with siz free synthetic water at a steady hydraulic retention time hrt of 48 h for 28 days in the following three stages the h2 mbfr was fed continuously with siz containing medium in

concentration of biomass was 0 325 g mlvss l 1 at last the biomass evenly distributed into six 350 ml glass bottles sealed with rubber caps and the water volume was 110 ml the initial ph of all the tests were adjusted to 7 0 0 5 via adding hcl or naoh solution to simulate the appropriate ph value for microorganisms all the tests temperature was maintained at 30 c in a constant temperature incubator hzq f160 jingbo china two bottles were only h2 but no nitrate was fed the other bottles were fed with different nitrate concentrations 1 5 or 10 mg n l 1 0 5 mg l 1 of siz was added in all tests the batch lasted for 7 days and samples were taken at 0 0 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 7 d concentrations of siz nitrate and nitrite were measured to explore if siz reduction was affected by h2 oxidizing autotrophic bacteria a series of batch tests was conducted 350 ml bottles were filled with 110 ml of medium and different h2 headspace volumes 0 10 or 20 ml and the remaining headspace was filled with n2 the initial siz was 0 5 mg l 1 in each bottle all bottles were deoxygenated with n2 gas first and then evacuated to fill the headspace with h2 and n2 the batch tests lasted for 7 d and water samples were taken at 0 0 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 7 d 2 5 analytical methods samples were stored after filtration through membrane ptfe 0 22 μm nitrate and nitrite were measured using uv spectrophotometry

spectrophotometric method 26 siz was measured using a high performance liquid chromatography hplc and siz transformation products were analyzed using a q exactive plus orbitrap mass spectrometer details of the analytical methods for siz and its possible products are in section 1 of the si 2 6 related calculations the surface loading rates slr g m 2 d 1 of electron acceptors were calculated by

and microbial community analysis to collect biofilm samples part of membrane was cut from the fiber bundles at the end of every stage as mrna degrades rapidly total rna was extracted immediately and then reverse transcribed to cdna immediately the detailed protocols were summarized in section 1 of the si nitrate is firstly reduced to nitrite by nitrate reductase which is then reduced to nitric oxide through nitrite reductase the reductases are encoded by the narg and nirk nirs genes respectively 28 these denitrification related genes were characterized by the copy number from dna and their corresponding transcription level from cdna antimicrobial resistance gene sul1 the class 1 integron integrase gene inti1 and sulfate reducing gene dsra also were characterized from dna and their corresponding transcription level from cdna the designed primer pairs and primer sequences were shown in table s1 detailed procedures for measuring dna and cdna are summarized in section 1 and table s2 in the si a 338f 806r primer pair details were shown in table s2 was employed to amplify the v3 and v4 regions of the16s rdna gene dna samples obtained above were sent to major biotech co ltd shanghai china to conduct illumina miseq sequencing and raw results were analyzed on qiime platform 29 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrate removal of the h2 mbfr fig 1 a shows concentrations of no3 and no2 across all stages for the 100 days of operation stage 1 which lasted for 28 days had only 10 mg l 1 no3 n in the influent at a surface loading of 0 042 g m 2 d 1 stage 1 gave stable no3 n removal of 94 and no nitrite was detected in the effluent in stage 2 days 29 54 0 5 mg l 1 of siz also was added into the feed denitrification in the h2 mbfr was slightly influenced 90 no3 removal without no2 accumulation in stage 3 days 55 70 the surface loadings of no3 n and siz were increased to 0 126 and 0 006 g m 2 d 1 respectively the nitrate removal efficiency slightly increased to 93 even though the no3 n and siz loadings were three times higher compared to stage 2 apparently the microorganisms had adapted to siz by stage 3 with the highest siz surface loading of 0 063 g m 2 d 1 in stage 4 days 71 100 the effluent no3 n was 0 4 mg l 1 with no nitrite detected collectively the results indicate that the input of siz at the mg l 1 level had a negligible impact on autotrophic denitrification the abundances and transcription levels of denitrification genes nirs nirk and narg genes are shown in fig 1 b the abundances of narg genes were up to 103 copies ng 1 dna the abundances of nirs genes were 105 copies ng 1 dna in all stages and of nirk genes were 104 105 104 104 copies ng 1 dna for stage 1 2 3 and 4 respectively thus the narg gene for nitrite reduction to nitric oxide were less abundant than the genes for enzymes that catalyze nitrate reduction to nitrite whether or not siz was added while siz addition had minimal influence on nirs genes copy numbers nirk increased from 1 5 104 copies ng 1 dna stage 1 to 2 3 105 copies ng 1 dna stage 2 and then decreased to 1 6 104 copies ng 1 dna stage 3 and 4 this trend suggests that the lower siz concentration 0 5 mg l 1 promoted the growth of denitrifiers containing the nirk gene while the higher concentration 5 mg l 1 may have inhibited their growth a similar pattern occurred at the transcription level although transcription levels were consistently smaller than gene levels particularly siz addition had little influence on narg nirk and nirs transcription levels indicating that the expression of enzymes key to denitrification were not affected by the input of siz this trend is reinforced by the nearly complete removal of nitrate and nitrite in all stages 3 2 sulfisoxazole removal antimicrobial resistance and sulfate reducing genes in the h2 mbfr fig 2 a shows the concentrations of siz in the influent and the effluent during stages 2 3 and 4 in stage 2 the effluent siz rapidly dropped to undetectable level 0 01 mg l 1 in stage 3 with 3 times higher surface loading siz in the effluent gradually increased to 0 06 mg l 1 within 3 days and removal efficiency was 88 increasing the influent siz concentration to 5 mg l 1 in stage 4 led to an average effluent siz concentration of 1 05 mg l 1 or 79 removal efficiency the volumetric removal rates of siz for these three stages were 0 17 mg l 1 d 1 0 44 mg l 1 d 1 and 3 98 mg l 1 d 1 respectively these removal rates are higher than those reported for conventional activated sludge and methanogenic processes removing sulfa antimicrobiotics for example kang et al 30 found the sulfamethoxazole removal rate was only 4 μg l 1 d 1 and zhang et al 24 reported 23 μg l 1 d 1 for autotrophic denitrification based on sulfur oxidation another change in stage 4 was that dissolved hydrogen sulfide was detected in the effluent for the first time when sulfate was avoided in the feed with an average concentration of 0 33 mg l 1 fig 2 a thomas et al 31 reported that in addition to sulfate organic compounds such as dimethylsulfoxide and sulfonates can be used as terminal electron acceptors for the growth of srb and form sulfide combined with the siz chemical structure the sulfide may be the reduction product of sulfate group in siz by srb the abundances of the sul1 gene for sulfonamide resistance the class 1 integron integrase gene inti1 and the sulfate reducing gene dsra are shown in fig 2 b the sul1 and inti1 genes were detected in the biofilms of stage 2 3 and 4 as the siz loading increased the abundance of sul1 increased from 3 103 copies ng 1 dna in stage 2 to 1 7 104 and 1 2 104 copies ng 1 dna in stage 3 and 4 respectively bacteria containing the sul1 gene which encodes dihydropteroate synthase can resist sulfonamides inhibition 17 increasing sul1 supports that bacteria able to resist siz increased in the biofilm the expression of sul1 in all siz addition stages further indicates that the sul1 gene may have been a means to protect the microorganisms from siz the class 1 integron integrase gene plays a major role in the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes args 32 the abundance of inti1 increased from 9 6 103 copies ng 1 dna in stage 2 to 3 7 104 and 2 5 104 copies ng 1 dna in stages 3 and 4 respectively thus inti1 was expressed with all siz additions which underscores the likely role of horizontal gene transfer the abundance of dsra gene in stages 1 2 3 and 4 were 4 9 104 4 1 104 6 4 104 and 3 4 104 copies ng 1 dna respectively which were not changed greatly since the dsra gene and its transcription product were detected at significant levels in stages 2 3 and 4 compared to stage 1 fig 2 b sulfate reducing bacteria srb were present and likely functioning in the biofilm they may have played a role in siz biotransformation particularly since the abundances of the dsra gene and its transcription product were similar to or greater than for the denitrification genes fig 1 b 3 3 effect of nitrate concentration and hydrogen volume on sulfisoxazole removal in batch experiments the effect of the nitrate concentration on siz removal was studied through batch experiments and the results are shown in fig 3 a in the absence of nitrate the siz removal efficiency was 97 after 7 d however in the presence of 10 mg n l 1 no3 only 47 of the spiked siz was removed during the 7 d batch tests even though nitrate was reduced to an undetectable level within 12 h and nitrite was not detectable fig s2 as shown in fig 3 b the total mass of available h2 was 9 8 mm and only 0 23 mm h2 was needed to remove 10 mg n l 1 no3 the remaining h2 9 6 mm was far in excess of that needed to remove all the siz 0 0016 mm h2 was needed thus h2 availability was not the factor that influenced siz removal by h2 oxidizing bacteria sulfate reduction can be inhibited by nitrate 33 and additional research is needed to explore the cause of inhibition by no3 fig 3 c explores the effect of h2 availability on siz removal efficiency in the absence of h2 the siz concentration decreased slowly and reached a plateau in four days however when h2 was added into the bottle even at a low volume 10 ml the siz concentration decreased dramatically with increasing of reaction time thus siz could be utilized by heterotrophic microorganisms but far slower than by the h2 oxidizing bacteria 3 4 sulfisoxazole transformation products to elucidate the degradation pathway for siz with h2 mbfr biomass for the h2 autotrophic conditions liquid samples from the batch tests were examined using q eplus mass spectrometry the chemical structures and the q eplus scan data of the degradation intermediates are presented in table 2 the q eplus total ion chromatogram is presented in fig s3 and fig 4 shows how the structures in table 2 form a biodegradation pathway for siz some of the intermediates had an altered isoxazole ring similar to the products of sulfamethoxazole degradation during sulfate reduction 16 and autotrophic denitrification that sulfur was used as electron donor 24 thus one of the attack sites was in the isoxazole ring we propose that ring cleavage started at the no bond with the cc and cn double bonds saturated through hydrogenation to form transformation production i i e tpi two important pathways for sulfonamide degradation were initiated by the cleavage of the sulfonamide csn bond through pathways a and b 34 tpii formed through pathway a was further hydrolyzed to form p aminobenzenesulfonic acid which also can be formed through pathway b tpiii was formed through so hydrogenation of p amino benzenesulfonic acid which can be realized by sulfate reduction bacteria consistent with the discussion in section 3 3 3 5 microbial community shaped by sulfisoxazole rarefaction analysis in the light of otus based on 97 similarity was shown in fig s4 the sequencing depth fully indicated the diversity of microbial community in the biofilm samples of all stages microbial community structure of all stages in h2 mbfr were presented in fig 5 which shows that meiothermus pseudoxanthomonas pannonibacter sulfuritalea erysipelothrix and thauera were the main known denitrifying genera 24 35 37 in stage 1 without siz the relative abundances of these denitrifiers were 79 0 3 0 36 8 6 2 and 3 respectively the abundances of these denitrifying genera were changed by siz loading meiothermus a denitrifier that can survive in extreme environments and plays a role in biofilm formation 38 maintained its dominance in all stages which implies that it is well adapted to siz stress while the relative abundance of thauera held at 1 8 3 8 throughout all stages the relative abundances of pseudoxanthomonas and pannonibacter increased dramatically to 18 3 and 17 3 respectively when the h2 mbfr received 0 5 mg l 1 of siz stage 2 but then decreased sharply to non detected when the siz loading increased further in stage 3 while siz changed the distribution among the nitrate reducing genera the total abundance of otus of denitrifiers remained a large majority with siz addition 90 89 89 and 64 respectively for stages 1 2 3 and 4 this otu stability was consistent with the good denitrification throughout h2 mbfr operation sulfate reducing bacteria srb norank f srb2 erysipelothrix and thauera were detected and remained almost unchanged in relative abundance throughout all h2 mbfr operating stages qiu et al 39 observed that biomass containing srb can biodegrade sulfamethoxazole more efficiently than denitrifying biomass combined with the information of sulfide production and the presence of dsra gene section 3 2 the phylogenetic information here suggest that srb also utilized siz as electron acceptor besides h2 srb has the ability to grow on a number of organic compounds such as ethanol lactate even aromatic compounds combined with section 3 3 the results in fig 5 b support that heterotrophic srb also may have been active in metabolizing siz or its breakdown products as an electron acceptor electron donor or both 4 conclusion this study documented siz biotransformation in a h2 based mbfr carrying out autotrophic denitrification the presence of siz added at 5 mg l 1 had minimal influence on denitrification performance although 10 mg n l 1of nitrate could inhibit siz removal high siz removal rate at 3 98 mg l 1 d 1 was obtained three transformation products were identified and all were formed via hydrogenation reduction reactions the presence of siz shaped the microbial communities on the one hand the relative abundance of denitrifiers decreased from 89 to 64 with the highest siz surface loading rate on the other hand denitrification was stable throughout h2 mbfr operation which should make the h2 mbfr a promising technology to remove nitrate and siz simultaneously srb were present in all stages as the biofilms had relatively high abundances of the dsra gene and its transcription products compared to stage 1 while sulfide was generated in the final stage srb appeared to make a big difference in siz removal in the h2 mbfr perhaps as an electron acceptor electron donor or both

12672,sulfisoxazole siz a common antimicrobial prescribed for treating infections in livestock is frequently detected in surface water and groundwater along with nitrate the interactions of siz biotransformation and nitrate removal were investigated in a h2 based membrane biofilm reactor h2 mbfr through long term reactor operation augmented by short term batch experiments in serum bottles denitrification in the h2 mbfr was not influenced by siz when its input concentration was 5 mg l 1 although siz removal was inhibited by nitrate transformation products identified by mass spectrometry

and microbial community analysis to collect biofilm samples part of membrane was cut from the fiber bundles at the end of every stage as mrna degrades rapidly total rna was extracted immediately and then reverse transcribed to cdna immediately the detailed protocols were summarized in section 1 of the si nitrate is firstly reduced to nitrite by nitrate reductase which is then reduced to nitric oxide through nitrite reductase the reductases are encoded by the narg and nirk nirs genes respectively 28 these denitrification related genes were characterized by the copy number from dna and their corresponding transcription level from cdna antimicrobial resistance gene sul1 the class 1 integron integrase gene inti1 and sulfate reducing gene dsra also were characterized from dna and their corresponding transcription level from cdna the designed primer pairs and primer sequences were shown in table s1 detailed procedures for measuring dna and cdna are summarized in section 1 and table s2 in the si a 338f 806r primer pair details were shown in table s2 was employed to amplify the v3 and v4 regions of the16s rdna gene dna samples obtained above were sent to major biotech co ltd shanghai china to conduct illumina miseq sequencing and raw results were analyzed on qiime platform 29 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrate removal of the h2 mbfr fig 1 a shows concentrations of no3 and no2 across all stages for the 100 days of operation stage 1 which lasted for 28 days had only 10 mg l 1 no3 n in the influent at a surface loading of 0 042 g m 2 d 1 stage 1 gave stable no3 n removal of 94 and no nitrite was detected in the effluent in stage 2 days 29 54 0 5 mg l 1 of siz also was added into the feed denitrification in the h2 mbfr was slightly influenced 90 no3 removal without no2 accumulation in stage 3 days 55 70 the surface loadings of no3 n and siz were increased to 0 126 and 0 006 g m 2 d 1 respectively the nitrate removal efficiency slightly increased to 93 even though the no3 n and siz loadings were three times higher compared to stage 2 apparently the microorganisms had adapted to siz by stage 3 with the highest siz surface loading of 0 063 g m 2 d 1 in stage 4 days 71 100 the effluent no3 n was 0 4 mg l 1 with no nitrite detected collectively the results indicate that the input of siz at the mg l 1 level had a negligible impact on autotrophic denitrification the abundances and transcription levels of denitrification genes nirs nirk and narg genes are shown in fig 1 b the abundances of narg genes were up to 103 copies ng 1 dna the abundances of nirs genes were 105 copies ng 1 dna in all stages and of nirk genes were 104 105 104 104 copies ng 1 dna for stage 1 2 3 and 4 respectively thus the narg gene for nitrite reduction to nitric oxide were less abundant than the genes for enzymes that catalyze nitrate reduction to nitrite whether or not siz was added while siz addition had minimal influence on nirs genes copy numbers nirk increased from 1 5 104 copies ng 1 dna stage 1 to 2 3 105 copies ng 1 dna stage 2 and then decreased to 1 6 104 copies ng 1 dna stage 3 and 4 this trend suggests that the lower siz concentration 0 5 mg l 1 promoted the growth of denitrifiers containing the nirk gene while the higher concentration 5 mg l 1 may have inhibited their growth a similar pattern occurred at the transcription level although transcription levels were consistently smaller than gene levels particularly siz addition had little influence on narg nirk and nirs transcription levels indicating that the expression of enzymes key to denitrification were not affected by the input of siz this trend is reinforced by the nearly complete removal of nitrate and nitrite in all stages 3 2 sulfisoxazole removal antimicrobial resistance and sulfate reducing genes in the h2 mbfr fig 2 a shows the concentrations of siz in the influent and the effluent during stages 2 3 and 4 in stage 2 the effluent siz rapidly dropped to undetectable level 0 01 mg l 1 in stage 3 with 3 times higher surface loading siz in the effluent gradually increased to 0 06 mg l 1 within 3 days and removal efficiency was 88 increasing the influent siz concentration to 5 mg l 1 in stage 4 led to an average effluent siz concentration of 1 05 mg l 1 or 79 removal efficiency the volumetric removal rates of siz for these three stages were 0 17 mg l 1 d 1 0 44 mg l 1 d 1 and 3 98 mg l 1 d 1 respectively these removal rates are higher than those reported for conventional activated sludge and methanogenic processes removing sulfa antimicrobiotics for example kang et al 30 found the sulfamethoxazole removal rate was only 4 μg l 1 d 1 and zhang et al 24 reported 23 μg l 1 d 1 for autotrophic denitrification based on sulfur oxidation another change in stage 4 was that dissolved hydrogen sulfide was detected in the effluent for the first time when sulfate was avoided in the feed with an average concentration of 0 33 mg l 1 fig 2 a thomas et al 31 reported that in addition to sulfate organic compounds such as dimethylsulfoxide and sulfonates can be used as terminal electron acceptors for the growth of srb and form sulfide combined with the siz chemical structure the sulfide may be the reduction product of sulfate group in siz by srb the abundances of the sul1 gene for sulfonamide resistance the class 1 integron integrase gene inti1 and the sulfate reducing gene dsra are shown in fig 2 b the sul1 and inti1 genes were detected in the biofilms of stage 2 3 and 4 as the siz loading increased the abundance of sul1 increased from 3 103 copies ng 1 dna in stage 2 to 1 7 104 and 1 2 104 copies ng 1 dna in stage 3 and 4 respectively bacteria containing the sul1 gene which encodes dihydropteroate synthase can resist sulfonamides inhibition 17 increasing sul1 supports that bacteria able to resist siz increased in the biofilm the expression of sul1 in all siz addition stages further indicates that the sul1 gene may have been a means to protect the microorganisms from siz the class 1 integron integrase gene plays a major role in the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes args 32 the abundance of inti1 increased from 9 6 103 copies ng 1 dna in stage 2 to 3 7 104 and 2 5 104 copies ng 1 dna in stages 3 and 4 respectively thus inti1 was expressed with all siz additions which underscores the likely role of horizontal gene transfer the abundance of dsra gene in stages 1 2 3 and 4 were 4 9 104 4 1 104 6 4 104 and 3 4 104 copies ng 1 dna respectively which were not changed greatly since the dsra gene and its transcription product were detected at significant levels in stages 2 3 and 4 compared to stage 1 fig 2 b sulfate reducing bacteria srb were present and likely functioning in the biofilm they may have played a role in siz biotransformation particularly since the abundances of the dsra gene and its transcription product were similar to or greater than for the denitrification genes fig 1 b 3 3 effect of nitrate concentration and hydrogen volume on sulfisoxazole removal in batch experiments the effect of the nitrate concentration on siz removal was studied through batch experiments and the results are shown in fig 3 a in the absence of nitrate the siz removal efficiency was 97 after 7 d however in the presence of 10 mg n l 1 no3 only 47 of the spiked siz was removed during the 7 d batch tests even though nitrate was reduced to an undetectable level within 12 h and nitrite was not detectable fig s2 as shown in fig 3 b the total mass of available h2 was 9 8 mm and only 0 23 mm h2 was needed to remove 10 mg n l 1 no3 the remaining h2 9 6 mm was far in excess of that needed to remove all the siz 0 0016 mm h2 was needed thus h2 availability was not the factor that influenced siz removal by h2 oxidizing bacteria sulfate reduction can be inhibited by nitrate 33 and additional research is needed to explore the cause of inhibition by no3 fig 3 c explores the effect of h2 availability on siz removal efficiency in the absence of h2 the siz concentration decreased slowly and reached a plateau in four days however when h2 was added into the bottle even at a low volume 10 ml the siz concentration decreased dramatically with increasing of reaction time thus siz could be utilized by heterotrophic microorganisms but far slower than by the h2 oxidizing bacteria 3 4 sulfisoxazole transformation products to elucidate the degradation pathway for siz with h2 mbfr biomass for the h2 autotrophic conditions liquid samples from the batch tests were examined using q eplus mass spectrometry the chemical structures and the q eplus scan data of the degradation intermediates are presented in table 2 the q eplus total ion chromatogram is presented in fig s3 and fig 4 shows how the structures in table 2 form a biodegradation pathway for siz some of the intermediates had an altered isoxazole ring similar to the products of sulfamethoxazole degradation during sulfate reduction 16 and autotrophic denitrification that sulfur was used as electron donor 24 thus one of the attack sites was in the isoxazole ring we propose that ring cleavage started at the no bond with the cc and cn double bonds saturated through hydrogenation to form transformation production i i e tpi two important pathways for sulfonamide degradation were initiated by the cleavage of the sulfonamide csn bond through pathways a and b 34 tpii formed through pathway a was further hydrolyzed to form p aminobenzenesulfonic acid which also can be formed through pathway b tpiii was formed through so hydrogenation of p amino benzenesulfonic acid which can be realized by sulfate reduction bacteria consistent with the discussion in section 3 3 3 5 microbial community shaped by sulfisoxazole rarefaction analysis in the light of otus based on 97 similarity was shown in fig s4 the sequencing depth fully indicated the diversity of microbial community in the biofilm samples of all stages microbial community structure of all stages in h2 mbfr were presented in fig 5 which shows that meiothermus pseudoxanthomonas pannonibacter sulfuritalea erysipelothrix and thauera were the main known denitrifying genera 24 35 37 in stage 1 without siz the relative abundances of these denitrifiers were 79 0 3 0 36 8 6 2 and 3 respectively the abundances of these denitrifying genera were changed by siz loading meiothermus a denitrifier that can survive in extreme environments and plays a role in biofilm formation 38 maintained its dominance in all stages which implies that it is well adapted to siz stress while the relative abundance of thauera held at 1 8 3 8 throughout all stages the relative abundances of pseudoxanthomonas and pannonibacter increased dramatically to 18 3 and 17 3 respectively when the h2 mbfr received 0 5 mg l 1 of siz stage 2 but then decreased sharply to non detected when the siz loading increased further in stage 3 while siz changed the distribution among the nitrate reducing genera the total abundance of otus of denitrifiers remained a large majority with siz addition 90 89 89 and 64 respectively for stages 1 2 3 and 4 this otu stability was consistent with the good denitrification throughout h2 mbfr operation sulfate reducing bacteria srb norank f srb2 erysipelothrix and thauera were detected and remained almost unchanged in relative abundance throughout all h2 mbfr operating stages qiu et al 39 observed that biomass containing srb can biodegrade sulfamethoxazole more efficiently than denitrifying biomass combined with the information of sulfide production and the presence of dsra gene section 3 2 the phylogenetic information here suggest that srb also utilized siz as electron acceptor besides h2 srb has the ability to grow on a number of organic compounds such as ethanol lactate even aromatic compounds combined with section 3 3 the results in fig 5 b support that heterotrophic srb also may have been active in metabolizing siz or its breakdown products as an electron acceptor electron donor or both 4 conclusion this study documented siz biotransformation in a h2 based mbfr carrying out autotrophic denitrification the presence of siz added at 5 mg l 1 had minimal influence on denitrification performance although 10 mg n l 1of nitrate could inhibit siz removal high siz removal rate at 3 98 mg l 1 d 1 was obtained three transformation products were identified and all were formed via hydrogenation reduction reactions the presence of siz shaped the microbial communities on the one hand the relative abundance of denitrifiers decreased from 89 to 64 with the highest siz surface loading rate on the other hand denitrification was stable throughout h2 mbfr operation which should make the h2 mbfr a promising technology to remove nitrate and siz simultaneously srb were present in all stages as the biofilms had relatively high abundances of the dsra gene and its transcription products compared to stage 1 while sulfide was generated in the final stage srb appeared to make a big difference in siz removal in the h2 mbfr perhaps as an electron acceptor electron donor or both

the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction discharge of hazardous materials containing pollutants over permitted limits has caused environmental damage for years 1 5 these hazardous materials natural or man made threaten human health due to their toxicity 6 these include dyes heavy metals herbicides and pesticides these environmental contaminants caused chronic disorders and slowed learning capability and development in children analytical science focuses on the efficient elimination of food and environmental contaminants 7 identifying the optimal treatment strategy for removing dyes from wastewaters and enhancing treated wastewater quality requires knowledge of wastewater composition source and procedure 8 trace amounts of pollutants have been removed from wastewaters employing innovative treatment methods these techniques are for example chemical precipitation electro dialysis 9 electrochemical reaction 10 ion exchange 11 coagulation flocculation 12 membrane filtration 13 and reverse osmosis 14 although each of these techniques possesses several limitations like generation of excess sludge high capital or working costs and low efficiency these are unseemly in use by small scale industries 15 adsorption is preferred over alternative methods because it is efficient fast and responsive to toxic pollutants 16 18 additionally it has cheap start up costs produces nontoxic byproducts and is comparatively easy in terms of activity and treatment unit design additionally it has cheap start up costs produces nontoxic byproducts and is comparatively easy in terms of activity and treatment unit design 19 20 adsorbent nature and type have an impact on adsorption efficiency both inorganic and organic materials can detoxify wastewater scientists have concentrated on alumina 21 activated carbon 22 agricultural solid wastes 23 bacterial biomass 24 clays 25 industrial by products 26 peat 27 polysaccharides 28 silica gel 29 and zeolites 30 an ideal adsorbent for dye evacuation should have the accompanying properties appropriate pore size and volume compatibility cost effectiveness ease of regeneration easy accessibility environmentally friendly large surface area high adsorption capacity high selectivity and mechanical stability 31 thus scientists have focused on creating materials dependent on characteristic polymers to serve as an alternative adsorbent with low cost and improved adsorption capacity 32 the hydrocolloids or natural gums known as polysaccharides are a large class of glycosidic bonded carbohydrate polymers that come from naturally occurring sources animal polysaccharides plant polysaccharides and microbial polysaccharides are the three main categories of polysaccharides in recent years gum polysaccharides have been investigated for drug delivery systems emulsifiers stabilizers and thickeners in cosmetics lithography pharmaceuticals and textiles 33 34 since gum polysaccharides have multiple functionalities in their chemical structure hydrogels based on gums adsorb pollutants from aqueous solutions such as dyes heavy metal ions and oils 35 36 the fundamental benefit of employing hydrogels derived of gum polysaccharides as adsorbents is that they are environmentally friendly other benefits include responsiveness to pollutant nature with the exception of chitosan most gum polysaccharides are anionic which means that removing effectively cationic pollutants like cationic dyes e g malachite green methylene blue rhodamine b 37 and heavy metal cations like cu2 hg2 cd2 pb2 38 39 however chemically modified gum polysaccharides likewise exhibit potential for removing anionic pollutants specifically anionic dyes e g methyl orange and congo red 40 42 hydrogel investigation has been ongoing for several decades and by purifying wastewater the science may accomplish the promise of a world without drought 43 44 in wastewater treatment hydrogels have shown predominant effectiveness in the adsorptive evacuation of various sorts of inorganic and organic pollutants 45 46 in numerous research hydrogels have evidently outcompeted the traditional adsorbents particularly adsorption capacity 47 three dimensional polymeric networks termed hydrogels which are water retentive without dissolving 48 hydrogels have been altered to get more functional features in the desired applications such as high durability high rate of absorption less residual content maximum equilibrium swelling odorless photo stability and porosity 49 50 hydrogels are physically and chemically stable flexible polymeric network multi functional and reusable in nature 51 although the various adsorption approaches have set up hydrogels for the efficient cleaning of water these materials still need to be improved in terms of solid mechanical characteristics and degradability under various dynamic conditions 52 after acknowledging several research efforts in this area we can list the best qualities of hydrogels in conjunction with recent advances in material science 53 54 the characteristics of various gum polysaccharides several polymerization processes adsorbents for removing inorganic and organic pollutants from wastewater and aqueous solutions are the main themes of this paper many reviews on the theme of designing adsorbents for wastewater treatment have been delivered during the past decade by scientists from a wide variety of disciplines chemists environmental engineers materials physics however there are fewer publications focused to assessing major innovations in natural gums based hydrogels as adsorbents for wastewater treatment showing that this topic still has research gaps therefore we seek to consolidate the prior research findings in this topic the novelty of this article provides a more in depth analysis of natural gum based hydrogels as adsorbents for wastewater treatment taking into account the structural variety of these hydrogels first it is shown that natural gum based hydrogels are used to make adsorbents later the various polymerization methods employed for hydrogel cross linking are discussed then some important measuring techniques for the adsorption of hydrogels are described finally knowledge gaps regarding natural gum based hydrogels as adsorbents for the removal of inorganic and organic pollutants from wastewater and aqueous solutions are briefly debated the current review will provide a systematic and robust framework for rationally preparing natural gum based hydrogel adsorbents for wastewater treatment furthermore the current review will spark interdisciplinary debates that will revolutionize the use of hydrogels based on natural gums as wastewater adsorbents 1 1 principle this review concentrated on characterizing hydrogels made from antimicrobial gum that act as adsorbents for organic and inorganic pollutants this rigorous reproducible and explicit review followed three steps 1 screening 2 selection and 3 categorization of the literature 1 1 1 screening the scopus web of science wos and multidisciplinary databases were utilized to gather papers published from 2012 to 2022 relevant articles appeared in the adsorptive removal the author then added demanding keywords such as water pollutants traditional methods adsorptive removal waterborne diseases polysaccharide chemically modified surface of polysaccharide keywords search as shown in table 1 to focus the search results we found nearly a thousand papers 1 1 2 selection after the process of filtering the literature the collected articles were also evaluated papers that were directly connected to wastewater detoxification and contained keywords in the main text excluding references were chosen furthermore extensive parameter listings methodology descriptions and outcome discussions were included in peer reviewed papers for future research finally approximately 300 publications were chosen for this assessment 1 1 3 categorization of the literature the extra papers were divided into three categories 1 gum based hydrogels as adsorbents preparation and design principles 2 gum based hydrogel adsorption characteristics and 3 potential and difficulties of gum based hydrogels as adsorbents 2 structure and functional properties of gum polysaccharides natural gums are heterogeneous polymers of monosaccharides linked by glycosidic linkages that can form either gel or viscous solution natural gums can be hydrolyzed to create monosaccharide or oligosaccharide components such arabinose galactose glucuronic acid and xylose composition of monosaccharide units type of bonding and polymerization extent govern soluble nature fluidity gelation power and surface qualities natural gums are eco friendly abundant cheap and biocompatible but their limited mechanical strength limits their usage in industrial applications attributed to the prevalence of different functional groups they are amenable to being transformed into more robust materials hydrogels are more mechanically stable than native gums while yet being biodegradable as natural gums there is such a wide variety of natural gums that has been explored for hydrogels appropriate for wastewater purification systems that it would take more than a book to cover them all 55 thus interest has been drawn to the most recent research and exploitations of these systems the different gum polysaccharides as well as their structural properties are discussed here 2 1 gum arabic gum arabic ga is a branching polysaccharide with metal cations calcium potassium and magnesium and a complex polymer structure 56 the molecular structure contains 1 3 β d galactopyranosyl units and side chains composed of five to two 1 3 linked β d galactopyranosyl units as lateral chains joined to the dorsum through 1 6 linkages both the main and the side chains contain units of α l rhamnopyranosyl α l arabinofuranosyl βd glucuronopyranosyl and 4 o methyl β d glucuronopyranosyl units the last two being the end terminal units 57 table 2 a demonstrates the molecular structure of gum arabic even at high gum concentrations ga has a minimal viscosity and its capacity to interface with various molecules primarily proteins minerals and polyphenols depends on its distinctive structural characteristics carbohydrate protein macrostructure in a recent study temperature and ph responsive hydrogels were developed using gum arabic with aam utilized for the purification of salt water 58 gum arabic and fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticle based adsorbents were used to remove cu2 from aqueous solution using this gum arabic based magnetic adsorbent 200 mg l 1 cu2 solutions adsorb in 2 min the adsorption rapidly occurs on the exterior of the adsorbent because the adsorption sites are available at the external surface of adsorbent 59 2 2 guar gum gg guar gum occurs in the endosperm of cyamopsis tetragonolobus linn seeds leguminosae 60 it comprises predominantly high molecular weight polysaccharide structurally composed of galactan and mannan units connected through glycosidic linkages 61 table 2 b depicts the molecular structure of gg gg is composed of 1 4 diequatorially connected β d mannopyranosyl units linked with the side chains of 1 6 αd galactopyranosyl units guar gum is also known as guarina glucotard clusterbean calcutta lucern gum cyamposis cyamopsis gum and guyarem guar gum is non ionic and cheap it s easy to adapt to a specific contaminant cross linked or grafted guar gum hydrogels can trap heavy metals in aqueous solutions the cluster of polymers that contains or is sorbed with metal particles is laid down and isolated in very little amounts guar gum functions as an adsorbent for both inorganic and organic pollutants 62 when it comes to removing various harmful metal cations from aqueous solutions such as pb2 cu2 and methylene blue guar gum hydrogels have good adsorption capabilities 2 3 gum ghatti ggh gum ghatti ggh is a complex anionic polysaccharide that is produced by anogeissus latifolia s exudation tree which belongs to the combretaceae family 63 the primary molecular structure table 2 c of gg contains l arabinose d galactose d mannose d glucoronic acid and d xylose in the molar proportion of 48 29 10 10 5 64 it has primary chain of 1 6 connected β d galactopyranose units linked to alternating 4 o subsituted and 2 o subsituted α d mannopyranose units with the side chain of single l arabinofuranose units 65 the primary benefit of the hydrogels synthesized with gum ghatti is that they are entirely biodegradable 66 they are also very adsorbent l arabinose is present as a result in the ggg main chain its hydrogels can adsorb pb2 and cu2 gum ghatti based hydrogels and nanocomposites were used with fe3o4 to eliminate cationic dyes mb rb mg and mv and heavy metal cations pb2 and cu2 from aqueous solutions 67 69 compared to hydrogels made from other gum polysaccharides those made from gum ghatti show greater cationic impurity adsorption capabilities 2 4 gum karaya gk the complex molecule known as sterculia gum or gum karaya sterculia urens is made up of a partly acetylated acidic polysaccharide that is produced as a calcium and magnesium salt from sterculia urens tree exudates 70 71 gk molecular structure is depicted in table 2 d the main structure chain is a rhamnogalacturonan consisting of α 1 4 linked d galacturonic acid and α 1 2 linked l rhamnose residues and is associated with the side chain made up of 1 2 linked β d galactose or 1 3 linked β d glucuronic acid to the galacturonic acid unit where one portion of the rhamnose moieties of the main chain is substituted by 1 4 linked β d galactose 72 galactose 13 26 and rhamnose 15 30 make up the majority of the sugar residues in gum karaya which is significantly more than in other exudate gums however compared to other exudate gums the protein level 1 is somewhat lower another component contains 8 of acetyl groups and 40 of uronic acid residues gum karaya has a weak solubility in water and its swelling properties are brought on by the high acetyl concentration but to produce dispersions the gum swells up to many times its original weight 2 5 tragacanth gum tg tragacanth gum is heterocyclic polysaccharide with a spheroidal molecular shape natural calcium magnesium and potassium salt that is slightly acidic it is a profoundly branched dried exudates obtained from different astragalus species however tragacanth gum is primarily composed of two fractions tragacanthin a water soluble component and tragacanthic acid also known as bassorin a water insoluble component though having a gelling capability because of swelling 73 74 the molecular structure presented in table 2 e comprises of a primary chain of repeating 1 6 linked d galactosyl backbones with l arabinose side chains joined by 1 2 1 3 and or 1 5 linkages in contrast tragacanthic acid which is consists of d galacturonic acid d galactose l fucose d xylose l arabinose and l rhamnose it has a 1 4 linked α d galactopyranosyl backbone chain with randomly subbed xylosyl branches linked at the c 3 position of the galacturonic acid residues 75 76 tragacanth gum molecules have primary and secondary hydroxyl and carboxylic acid groups which offer areas for reactions with monomers and

polysaccharides effective biodegradable materials for the elimination of organic and inorganic pollutants are antimicrobial gum polysaccharides these materials need to be modified in order to get around various downsides they have like dropping in viscosity when stored microbial contamination thickening and an unregulated rate of hydration 115 116 these modifications can be done via carboxymethylation carbamoylethylation cross linking or grafting of vinyl monomers onto polysaccharides which yield a customized material for the required application certain modifications such as carboxymethylation and carbamoylethylation by substitution of scarce free oh groups rises the aqueous solubility of gums 117 it ought to be noticed that several old materials vie effectively today after almost a century of efforts to replace them carboxymethylation of gums enhance their hydrophilicity solution clarity and solubility in aqueous systems various procedures could change polymer molecular interactions fundamentally two procedures are accessible as the physical approach and chemical approach physical technique uses gamma radiation dry heat 118 microwave radiation 119 uv radiation 120 121 and saturated steam to contact polymers molecularly whereas in chemical approach polymers are treated with chemicals such as aldehydes borax epichlorohydrin enolates or glutaraldehyde one of the best methods for cross linking is temperature since it avoids using potentially toxic chemicals in large scale production as well as a wide range of approaches and methodologies in their use 122 table 3 shows examples of modified gums grafting of acrylic acid or its derivatives on gums has been utilized for modifying the swelling characteristics chemical modification of guar gum 123 and gum arabic 124 and other gums through grafting has gotten impressive consideration for bestowing new functional groups for various applications grafting of gums with ions or other polymers requires accessibility of coo as well as ch2oh functional groups in the gum the most significant benefit of grafted gums is the ability to tailor the resulting molecule to produce matrices with a specific characteristic the grafted molecule could be chosen such that it doesn t solubilize while the gum solubilizes at a specific ph gum cross linking needs the presence of active functional groups in their basic structural components 125 subsequently gums for instance guar gum sterculia gum that have free alcoholic and or carboxylic units appear to be a good choice for modification by cross linking 4 antimicrobial activity of gum polysaccharides due to the wide range of infections and diseases the presence of hazardous microbes in the context of human health has become a major issue rapid antibiotic resistance makes the problem worse 136 the effects of microbial contamination adhesion persistence and colonization on surfaces are now harmful to society and public health materials with antimicrobial activity are being investigated for the elimination of pollutants as a means of resolving these problems 137 although antimicrobial materials can prevent or eliminate the bacteria on their surface or in their immediate environment they have severe clinical shortcomings including inadequate antimicrobial effectiveness problems with microbial resistance and difficulty working in a dynamic environment for this a variety of antimicrobial agents are employed an antimicrobial agent could be antiviral antifungal or antibacterial each one acts to inhibit the infection via a different way of action antimicrobial action can be explained as a collective term for all active principles agents that prevent the formation of microbial colonies inhibit the growth of bacteria and may destroy microorganisms consequently to fulfill the challenges in environmental applications there is a need for durable and effective antibacterial materials wide ranging uses for antimicrobial polymers exist in the realm of pollution elimination due to biocidal diffusion microbes are quickly able to develop resistance to traditional antimicrobials which can lead to environmental pollution and human toxicity these issues with microbial contamination can be addressed by antimicrobial polymeric materials because of their features such as enhancing antimicrobial efficacy and lowering residual toxicity their adaptable macromolecular chemistry facilitates the tailoring of polymer physicochemical properties to be used in pollutants removal 138 polymeric materials antibacterial capabilities can be enhanced chemically or by adding inorganic organic antimicrobial agents 137 139 gum polysaccharides have been combined with various nano fillers including metals and metal oxides such as au ag ag2o cuo tio2 mgo and zno as well as carbon and organic based nano fillers for use in a variety of applications including the biomedical environmental and textile industries 140 142 potential applications in the removal of pollutants have been attracted by antimicrobial nano fillers incorporated into gum polysaccharide matrices 142 antibacterial silver nanoparticles ag nps have received much interest for removing pollutants due to their unique activity against microbial attacks and long shelf life however there is a lot of interest in using ag nps with controlled size and shape to enhance the antibacterial property effective frameworks for the generation of uniformly dispersed size controlled ag nps are polymeric hydrogels for the synthesis of hydrogels the appropriate polymers and co monomers have been used and their physico chemical characteristics were precisely influenced not only by controlling ag nps size and shape in the presence of reducing agents but also by controlling ag np release at the site of action an antibacterial modified tg graphene oxide composite hydrogel has been synthesized and used as an adsorbent for the removal of pb 2 cd 2 and ag from wastewater hydrogel containing ag nps has been exploited to investigate antibacterial activity against gram positive staphylococcus aureus bacterium according to the findings under similar circumstances the silver nanocomposite hydrogel had a greater inhibitory effect 14 0 mm than the h6 hydrogel 9 0 mm fig 1 a the presence of nanosize ag nps in the hydrogel matrix which may diffuse out and interact with the lipid layer of bacterial cell membranes may be the cause of this improved antibacterial activity 143 sharma et al 144 have successfully synthesized gum acacia poly acrylamide ipn acrylic acid based nanocomposite hydrogels as prepared hydrogels were tested against three bacterial strains staphylococcus aureus escherichia coli pseudomonas aeruginosa for their antibacterial fig 1 b properties different levels of antibacterial activity were seen with both bacteria and fungi in the produced hydrogels in comparison to semi ipn ipn nanocomposite hydrogels demonstrated significant potential for preventing bacterial growth variable antibacterial action of hydrogels may be due to differences in cell wall of bacteria peptidoglycan and fungi chitin glucans mucopolysaccharides as well as cell wall composition of gram negative p aeruginosa and e coli and gram positive s aureus antimicrobial activities of gums having propitious sorption properties for organic inorganic pollutants are summarized in table 4 5 hydrogels hydrogels are macromolecular network structures that can imbibe expand and retain water without disintegrating these structures can be generated from hydrophilic polymers that are either naturally occurring or synthetically produced the degree of cross connecting and hydrophilic functionality that is present in the structure of the hydrogels is what gives them their resistance to dissolution and swelling capabilities 153 polymer hydrophilicity allows hydrogels to absorb water and the cross linking that exists between the various polymer networks ensures that the hydrogels are resistant to disintegrating fluid additionally plays a significant job in shaping some of the peculiar characteristics of hydrogels 154 there are a lot of different materials both naturally occurring and man made that satisfy the requirements of hydrogels on the other hand researchers are becoming familiar with new approaches and methods in order to create hydrogels with significantly improved biocompatibility mechanical properties super porous nature hybrid hydrogels grafted hydrogels and high stability fast response triblock copolymers imitating hydrogels have a bright future 5 1 classification of hydrogels the hydrogels types and classification are comprehensive and thus can be classified on myriad bases such as their sources of origin natural or synthetic origins 155 their configurations physical structure and chemical composition amorphous crystalline or semi crystalline its synthetic composition type such as interpenetrating polymeric hydrogel ipn homo polymeric and copolymeric its physical appearance and the nature of crosslinking junctions chemical or physical apart from this classification some other categories are also possible 156 the interactions among the polymer webs in the hydrogel is the root of another class a chemical or permanent hydrogel is attained when the interaction among polymer web or network is covalently crosslinked though the formation of molecular interactions and or secondary forces including hydrogen bonding hydrophobic interaction and ionic contact are linked to the reversible or physical type of hydrogel hydrogel which is derived from a single kind of monomer elementary unit of any polymer are referred as homopolymeric hydrogels homopolymeric hydrogels form crosslinked chemical conformation based on their monomer nature and polymerization technique copolymeric hydrogels consist of monomeric units each with a hydrophilic component these monomeric units can be arranged in a number of distinct patterns such as an alternating or block configuration or in a randomly arranged chain of polymer webs an innovative class of hydrogel known as interpenetrating polymeric hydrogel ipn is obtained when two independent components natural or synthetic crosslink in network formation hydrogels may exist in ionic or neutral form depending upon the charge present on the crosslinked chains 157 5 2 methods for hydrogels preparation there are many different approaches to creating hydrogels due to the concept of crosslinking polymer chain molecules the polymer chains may be cross linked by the use of a crosslinker the use of chemical modification the application of grafting or even through the application of high energy radiation such as gamma or ultraviolet rays using a conservative and efficient radical polymerization process hollow core shell particles and hydrogels with a variety of compositions morphologies and sizes are produced hydrogels can be made more useful by increasing the activity of functional groups either within or on their surface there are two sorts of crosslinking techniques used by different researchers or scientists to create hydrogels chemical crosslinking and physical crosslinking in spite of the fact that physical interactions take place between the polymer chains that make up hydrogel chemical methods can form covalent bonds between hydrogel polymer chains each cross linking technique has advantages and disadvantages of its own it is interesting to note that hydrogels developed using covalent crosslinking techniques tend to be more brittle than those created using mild physical crosslinking techniques these hydrogels are stabilized by weak connections between networks of polymer molecules such as hydrogen bonds hydrophobic interactions or ionic interactions 158 fig 2 shows hydrogel synthesis scheme 5 2 1 chemical methods physically crosslinked hydrogels have the advantage of forming gels devoid of any chemical modification or crosslinking agents but they also have limitations the main problem which is closely related to several other features is the mechanical strength of hydrogels permanent covalent connections are associated in chemical crosslinking leading to more stable hydrogels with increased mechanical strength although chemical cross linkers may introduce toxicity issues 5 2 1 1 crosslinking previously in chemical cross linked hydrogel various cross linkers namely glutaraldehyde ga epichlorohydrin ech adipic acid dihydrazide aad polyethylene glycol peg in situ generated cross linker and polyaldehydes pahs are extensively employed to attain cross linked hydrogel networks of several natural polymers 159 160 in attempt to develop this type of cross link a new molecule that possesses reactive functionality is inserted in between the polymeric chains this enables for the cross link to be established in addition covalent linkages can be generated between polymer chains through the reaction of functional groups such as an amine carboxylic acid reaction an isocyanate oh nh2 reaction or the production of a schiff base 161 aldehydes including formaldehyde acetaldehyde and glutaraldehyde are often utilized as crosslinkers in hydrogel crosslinking other aldehydes may also be used however glutaraldehyde causes to increase the toxicity of hydrogel constraining their application in order to fix such concerns researchers in situ produced a unique biocompatible cross linker that utilized polysaccharide as its basic material this biocompatible cross linker was found to be a superior replacement for chemical cross linker in the production of biocompatible hydrogels it has been suggested that the formation of dialdehyde groups from polysaccharide by periodate oxidation is a secure and effective biocompatible cross linker 162 163 monitoring the level of oxidation is one way to exercise control over the degree of cross linking that occurs condensation crosslinks two functional group containing molecules this process also produces other byproducts like water in addition to the big molecules chemically cross linked gels can also be formed from low molecular weight monomers by radical polymerization in the presence of a cross linking agent this is one of the enzyme catalyzed cross linking reaction is indeed a unique in situ hydrogel fabrication technique that replaces traditional cross linking techniques mostly used for synthesizing hydrogels this is a very efficient system even under benign circumstances that causes the gel to form quickly this system can be epitomized by using the free radical initiator such as ammonium persulfate aps or potassium persulfate kps in the synthesis of hydrogel 164 165 radiation cross linking is one of the additional types of chemical cross linking enzyme catalyzed cross linking reaction is another new technology for in situ hydrogel fabrication that offers an inventive replacement for traditional cross linking techniques microbial transglutaminases enzyme that catalyzes the amide bond formation between γ carboxamide group and the primary amine groups has been extensively explored in hydrogel preparation 166 167 enzyme cross linking is beneficial for natural polysaccharides that cannot withstand strong chemical conditions 168 5 2 1 2 grafting hydrogels developed by bulk polymerization typically have a weak structural foundation grafting a hydrogel onto a more durable substrate improves its mechanical characteristics grafting involves covalently polymerizing a polymer s backbone or adding a monomer to it 169 either use of such chemical reagents or high energy radiation treatment will activate the polymer chains chemical grafting involves chemical initiators such potassium persulfate benzoyl peroxide etc to activate polymer chains whereas irradiation grafting uses high energy radiation γ radiation to produce a free radical followed by polymerization via free radical polymerization 83 170 as a result when functional monomer is grafted onto activated polymer chains branching and cross linking occur one of the most significant ways to improve natural gums qualities and broaden the scope of their applications is by chemical alteration which is accomplished through grafting starch has been used and exploited as a superabsorbent hydrogel by grafting it with hydrophilic monomers like acrylic acid acrylamide and acrylonitrile 171 172 173 sadeghi and co workers developed the vinylic monomers acrylamide acrylic acid and methacrylic acid grafted κ carrageenan based superabsorbent hydrogel and investigated the consequence environment parameters such as salinity and ph on the swelling capacity the swelling degree exhibits maximum water absorbency at ph 8 with ph sensitivity they found that in highly basic and saline solution the charge screening effect took over and reduced swelling 174 a variety of polymeric supports have been used for the synthesis of hydrogel by grafting techniques 175 5 2 2 physical methods physical crosslinking comprises of numerous physical interactions between polymer networks such as hydrogen bonding hydrophobic interaction ionic interaction and stereo complex formation resulting in hydrogel formation 153 due to the lack of an external crosslinker physical crosslinking methods in hydrogel chemistry have developed into a significant tool in recent years the absence of crosslinker in polysaccharide gum based hydrogels sustains their biocompatibility and low toxicity thus upholding the benefits of their usage reversible hydrogel is provided via physical crosslinking but there may be structural flaws or non homogeneity as a result of free chain ends literature suggests that few methods are employed to achieve physically crosslinked hydrogels are described below 5 2 2 1 complex coacervation polyanionic and polycationic polymers form coacervate gel this approach allows inversely charged polymers to aggregate into complex structures depending on solution concentration and ph 176 lalevee et al developed highly stretchable hydrogels based on chitosan and hyaluronic acid through complex coacervation 177 in mechanical properties the fragile at ph pka of chitosan amine groups state of hydrogel changes to strong and flexible at ph pka of hyaluronic acid carboxylic groups hydrogel when there are salt ions na k and so forth stable gels form in aggregates because of repulsion of sulfonic group so3 5 2 2 2 freeze thawing in particular biocompatible and non toxic polysaccharides based gels has been synthesized by freeze thaw technique 178 in this method polymers freeze at extremely low temperatures before melting at ambient temperature which leads to formation of microcrystals in the structure of hydrogels the final property of the hydrogel can be achieved by various parameters such as freezing timing changing the ph temperature thawing rate and thawing cycle count however by treating the gels to repeated freeze thaw cycles or by lowering the temperature to 80 c the gels tensile strength can be increased 5 2 2 3 hydrogen bonding hydrogen bonding interactions may create physically crosslinked gel like structures the best example of such hydrogel is investigated by chen et al which shows formation of stronger hydrogen bonding between poly vinyl alcohol pva and tannic acid ta 179 the strong h bonding acts as permanent and robust cross links between pva and ta moreover the weaker h bonding between pva chains as reversible or temporary cross links 5 2 2 4 hydrophobic interaction the generation of crosslinked bonds with hydrophobic interaction is a more effective and superior method for the synthesis of hydrogels at high temperatures hydrophobic interactions take place in amphiphilic polymer solutions this method involves mixing hydrophobic monomers like blocks and hydrogels to hydrophobic monomers improve the hydrogel stability researchers have established that hydrophobic bonds between hydrophobic chains function as reversible crosslinks and can effectively eliminate crack energy 180 the energy dissipation due to these reversible crosslinking prevents hydrogel fracture as a result by adding hydrophobic monomers chains become more entangled and disperse energy more evenly when load is applied 181 5 2 2 5 ionic crosslinking or ionic interaction hydrogel formed by the crosslinking of di tri valent counter ions of ionic polysaccharides fall in this class this approach illustrates the notion of gelling a polyelectrolyte solution by adding conjugated ions with oppositely charged non uniformity in the structure makes it harder to control the gelation frequency which is a significant disadvantage although hydrogel can be crosslinked at ambient temperature under mild conditions or physiological ph hydrogels therefore are frequently used as the matrix for the encapsulation of living cells 182 counterions like calcium ions can crosslink sodium alginate kuo et al developed alginate hydrogel by ion crosslinking of calcium carbonate caco3 calcium chloride dihydrate cacl2 2h2o and calcium sulfate dihydrate caso4 2h2o along with d glucono δ lactone 183 as the concentration of counter ions and temperature rise the gelation degree becomes low at greater alginate concentrations mechanically stronger hydrogel with uniform structure through slow gelation 6 investigation and measurement techniques for hydrogels adsorption capabilities 6 1 hydrogel swelling measurement hydrogel effectiveness depends on the water absorption thus influences the pollutants adsorption the hydrogel s ability to absorb more water improves the adsorption of contaminants however the mechanical strength of the hydrogel is diminished with excessive swelling it is simple for contaminants to enter hydrogels when they are transported by water the most popular method for calculating hydrogel swelling is weight measurement with this method a particular amount of hydrogel wdry is submerged in deionized water and deionized water is released over a predetermined period of time frames filter paper absorbs the water on the surface and wwet weighed this method continues until water absorption stabilizes differences in dry and wet hydrogel weights are used to calculate the equilibrium water absorption quantity as mentioned in eq 1 184 1 water uptake w wet w dry w dry 100 crosslinker ph and temperature are the most influential factors in water absorption of hydrogel 6 2 analyzing and evaluating the adsorption of contaminants by hydrogel the fact that a quantitative analysis of the hydrogels adsorption rate proves their use makes it important a metal ion or dye solution is kept in contact with the hydrogels in a batch condition at a predefined concentration to determine the adsorption capacity until to the equilibrium adsorption amount is reached visible spectrophotometry is used to determine the concentration of contaminants still present in the solution as one of several parameters the subsequent relationships are utilized to determine the removal efficiency r retention capacity qr equilibrium adsorption

is the weight of dry hydrogel 185 the amount of adsorbent concentration contact time temperature ph and ionic strength of the contaminating solution are all factors that affect the hydrogels ability to absorb contaminants adsorption kinetics is an essential part of the adsorbent design process high adsorption capacity and high adsorption rate are required of an adsorbent for industrial usage the amount of contaminant adsorption is evaluated at timed intervals and the adsorption rate is calculated by fitting the data to various models standard models for studying hydrogels adsorption of contaminants include elovich 186 intraparticle diffusion ipd 187 pseudo second order pso 188 and pseudo first order pfo 189 table 5 demonstrates the linear and nonlinear forms of these models in order to understand the kinetic model controlling the process it is necessary to first understand the adsorption mechanism as shown in table 5 it is quite evident that the pseudo second order which describes adsorption by electrostatic interaction governs a major percentage of the adsorption process by hydrogels as the adsorption process reaches equilibrium distribution of adsorbed molecules in the solid and liquid phases are shown by adsorption isotherms 190 the adsorption isotherm is estimated at constant temperature by calculating the equilibrium adsorption capacity and equilibrium concentrations typically isotherms are employed to examine the adsorption process comprising freundlich 191 langmuir 192 redlich peterson 193 and temkin 194 where r2 linear regression coefficient decides the governing model table 6 shows the mathematical equation for these isotherms if linearly and non linearly the most well known isotherm is langmuir isotherm due to its consistency with experimental data table 6 the feasibility and mechanism of the adsorption process are determined by the investigation of thermodynamic parameter variation during the adsorption process the standard enthalpy change h standard entropy change s and standard free gibbs energy of g which are given by the accompanying relationship are the thermodynamic parameters 6 ln k c h rt s r 7 g h t s in the above relations r is gas constant t is absolute temperature and kc is equilibrium constant s and h are obtained by the intercept and slope of the lnkc versus 1 t plot respectively 195 the g determines the feasibility of the process whereas negative g value shows the spontaneity of adsorption process positive and negative values of h shows endothermic and exothermic adsorption processes respectively the increase in randomness at the interface between the gel and the polluted solution throughout the adsorption process is determined by positive values of s 196 197 6 3 determination of the adsorption mechanism by hydrogels although it is a difficult and complex task to describe the heavy metals and dyes adsorption mechanism by hydrogels it s crucial to study how heavy metals and dyes are removed from adsorbents many scientists suggest that the greater part of adsorption mechanism of heavy metals and dyes onto the hydrogels depends upon their chemical structure and their interactions such as complexation ion exchange electrostatic interaction hydrogen bonding hydrophobic interaction and the combination of several suggested mechanisms 198 nh2 groups of chitosan are responsible for adsorption of ny dye and cu 2 by chitosan montmorillonite hydrogel 199 at ph 5 6 ny dye adsorbs to hydrogel electrostatically because nh2 groups are in protonated structure nh3 as ph rises nh3 groups convert to nh2 groups as nitrogen atoms donate its electron lone pair with ny dye and cu 2 200 pb 2 adsorption process on sodium alginate carboxymethyl cellulose gel beads includes 1

carboxylate groups on hydrogel and cationic dye may account for the adsorption of methyl blue mb on sodium alginate cl poly acrylic tio2 hydrogel 202 different techniques were recommended to regulate adsorption system for example ftir xrd sem edx and xps examining the results of the experiments both before and after the contaminants are adsorbed reveals details concerning the adsorption mechanism 6 4 study of the regeneration and reusability of hydrogels the most important characteristics of a hydrogel for any application are its recuperative and reuse properties in addition to requiring recovery a hydrogel is likely to have a high rate of absorption and capacity in order to be economically cheap usually acid or alkaline solutions are used to regenerate hydrogels 198 key factors in hydrogel regeneration include selecting the appropriate solution volume concentration and optimum time the quantitative estimation of desorption efficiency is achieved by the associated relationships

concentration of the contaminated solution v r is volume of the regeneration solution v is volume of the feed solution q e is the adsorption capacity and q is the desorption capacity to examine the hydrogels reusability adsorption and desorption tests should be performed in multiple successive cycles 128 203 7 applications of gum based hydrogels as adsorbents hydrogels adaptability and versatility make them useful in many situations and contexts due to their water content hydrogels are flexible enough for industrial use fig 3 illustrates a few of the approaches in which hydrogels can be placed to use 7 1 adsorption of heavy metal ions apparently low quantities of heavy metal cations in water can have negative impacts on both human health and aquatic life 204 205 the primary causes of hazardous heavy metals presence in surface waterways are untreated industrial effluents and soil erosion 206 207 in the past few years different methods such as membrane separation electrochemical treatment coagulation and flocculation have been used to remove dangerous heavy metals from polluted water sources in the past few years different methods such as membrane separation ion exchange electrochemical treatment coagulation and flocculation have been used to remove dangerous heavy metals from polluted water sources however the adsorption approach has drawn a lot of attention due to its ease of use low cost and ability to remove even extremely small amounts of harmful heavy metals from wastewaters 208 210 toward this path adsorbents based on antimicrobial biopolymers got extraordinary consideration due to their earth favorable nature high adsorption efficiency and low costs gum polysaccharide based adsorbents have been extensively used to remove

effluents from the textile industry are full of poisonous dyes which have an adverse effect on both human health and oceanic biota s ability to photosynthesize synthetic dyes have mutagenic hazardous and carcinogenic properties 239 due to their high water solvency dyes are largely nondegradable and cannot be broken down in sludge processing facilities 240 242 hydrogels composed of gum polysaccharides are promising adsorbents that have been used to clean up wastewater 243 hydrogels based on gums like guar xanthan gum ghatti and gum karaya have recently been used to remove different dyes from wastewater anionic functional groups such as hydroxyl and carboxylic acid groups are present in the majority of gum polysaccharides they consequently absorb cationic dyes like rhb mv and mb even very high concentrations of cationic dyes can be removed by hydrogels made from natural gums 33 71 low dye concentrations exhibited chemical sorption high concentrations demonstrated physical

pesticides organophosphorus pesticides opps have become one of the most often used pesticides in agriculture during the past few decades mostly since strict restrictions on organochloride pesticides in the 1970s 281 282 opps were widely used due to their outstanding efficacy against a variety of pests and ectoparasites including flies lice and fleas accessibility and relatively low cost 281 while using these pesticides carelessly have environmental and health consequences by contaminating water supplies soil and agricultural products they do have the benefit of increasing crop productivity 283 recent studies have identified several opps effects as being mutagenic carcinogenic and neurotoxic 284 insecticides containing chlorpyrifos or o diethyl o 3 5 6 trichloro 2 pyridyl phosphorothioate are widely used in agriculture cities and homes 285 chlorpyrifos like other opps irreversibly inhibits the cetylcholinesterase acetylcholine is a chemical that sends messages between nerve cells in the brain and the rest of the body as a result acetylcholinesterase inhibition impairs the proper functioning of both the human and animal neurological systems 286 287 additionally the outcomes of recent investigations have revealed that they might adversely affect the differentiation and replication of brain cells 288 dna synthesis 289 and altering normal cellular growth and differentiation by inducing intracellular oxidative stress in certain tissues 290 291 as a consequence it is important to address this insecticide s removal from contaminated water for environmental and human health numerous types of adsorbents like metal oxide nanoparticles polymer based nanocomposites activated carbon have been utilized as adsorbents to remove opps among these adsorbents antimicrobial gum based hydrogel adsorbents have also been studied these include the development of zinc silver implanted montmorillonite integrated chitosan and ggh nanocomposites for the removal of dichlorvos from water 292 at ph 7 and ph 9 ggh and cs based nanocomposites absorbed the maximum dichlorvos at 30 c dichlorvos removal from all composites was greatest below this temperature activity may have diminished due to a lack of attraction force ggh cs and lactic acid modified montmorillonite cuo composites remove dichlorvos 293 at basic ph lactic acid and cs composites were more effective at adsorbing dichlorvos though when the ph increased the degree of dichlorvos adsorption by ggh composites decreased with increasing ph cs and lactic acid composites anionic surface charge became more evident increasing interaction between cationic dichlorvos and anionic composites and adsorption the hydronium ions h3o on the ggh composite surface are present at lower ph levels and strengthen the electrostatic interaction leading to greater adsorption for cs ggh and lactic acid composites the adsorption equilibrium of dichlorvos was attained after 5 5 and 12 h respectively after dichlorvos was quickly removed the rate eventually decreased the quantity of active sites on the composites initially increased and subsequently declined the greatest adsorption was seen in all of the composites at 30 c and then dropped past the ideal threshold the reduction in available active sites or the attractive forces among dichlorvos and composites may be the cause of the decreased adsorption above the optimal temperature cs lactic acid and ggh composites all showed the greatest levels of adsorption at concentrations of dichlorvos of 80 60 and 40 mg l 1 respectively the availability of sufficient pesticides supports the adsorption at a specific concentration however owing to the advent of an equilibrium between pesticides and composites there is no discernible improvement in adsorption beyond this concentration thakur et al 294 developed bentonite incorporated salg dextrin cl paa hydrogel matrix paraquat an extremely hazardous herbicide can be removed with this hydrogel composite fig 6 a the

hydrogel was used to adsorb crude oil from aqueous solution for the adsorption of oil from aqueous solutions the effects of ph contact time acrylic acid and glutaraldehyde concentration were studied compared to other hydrogels made with different amounts of acrylic acid the one made with 40 acrylic acid had a big advantage when it came to absorbing crude oil the maximum adsorption occurs in an acidic environment which can be explained by the fact that an acidic environment causes oil to become unstable and that gum tragacanth has a physiochemical effect that appears to demulsify the emulsion increase droplets size and thus improve oil adsorption 307 saruchi et al 308 developed a novel hydrogel of gum tragacanth acrylic acid methylmethacrylate gt g poly aa mma using glutaraldehyde

and used it to remove bpa from aqueous solutions grafting of carboxymethyl β cyclodextrin polymer onto magnetic nanoparticle surface leads to an improvement of the adsorption capacity of fe3o4

researchers have paid a lot of attention to natural gums as intriguing rare materials to create adsorbents for wastewater treatment because of their superior adsorption efficiency low cost nontoxicity biocompatibility biodegradability and biological activity yet there are numerous research uncertainties and gaps in the future additional pertinent research will be required to fill these knowledge gaps natural gum based hydrogel is being used in lab studies to simulate wastewater treatment but the real wastewater treatment frequently deviates greatly from the lab simulated wastewater treatment for instance actual wastewater generally contains a variety of contaminants metals dyes phenols pharmaceuticals and oils this suggests that forthcoming studies of natural gum based adsorbents would examine how well they remove many pollutants rather than just one additionally it is crucial to remove these various pollutants at the same time it is possible to reuse both the adsorbents and the contaminants that have been absorbed second adsorbent performance can be greatly impacted by differences in temperature and ph between the laboratory and the natural environment a simple approach to predicting the best conditions and applicability of natural gum based adsorbents underneath the real wastewater treatment system is to fit the properties of the real contaminant removal environment and laboratory adsorption data into machine learning models third natural gum based adsorbent manufacturing procedures require improvement since many synthesizing processes are restricted to labs and difficult to industrialize it is required to develop a method that is not only quick and simple but also economical and effective in the construction of polysaccharide based wastewater adsorbents overall manufacturing operation expenses extensive production pollutant resource recycling reuse adaptation to complicated situations and wasted adsorbent management ought to be subjected to rigorous industrial applications of natural gum based adsorbents 9 conclusion water pollution is a major cause of worry for everyone the treatment of wastewater prior to its release is of the utmost importance yet providing a universal technique for eliminating all contaminants from wastewater remains difficult the use of antimicrobial gums for pollutants removal is alluring because they are biocompatible capable of chemical modifications conceivably biodegradable and scarcely with any special cases economical promptly accessible and non toxic still they have problems like low surface area and weak mechanical strength that make them difficult to use in different industrial applications the text reviews the most up to date natural gum based hydrogels this review examines the different types of natural gum based hydrogels used to make adsorbents the methods of crosslinking principles of adsorbent design and the technical feasibility of using natural gum based hydrogels as adsorbents to remove pollutants from wastewater natural gums based hydrogels carry the potential in wastewater adsorption to eradicate organic inorganic pollutants recent work has shown that hydrogels made from natural gums have a lot of potential used in proper cleaning the property profile and adsorption performance of composites of hydrogels based on natural gums with other nanofillers were significantly enhanced hydrogels made from natural gums are quite effective at absorbing pollutants but they still need work in the areas of mechanical strength recycling structural integrity and pollution selectivity the fundamental problem of employing natural gums based hydrogels as adsorbents in water purification is their restricted adsorption toward charged pollutants i e either cationic or anionic hence it is necessary to design hydrogels based on natural gums that can simultaneously adsorb cationic and anionic pollutants hydrogels can be synthesized or developed to address this issue i by utilizing two distinct types of natural gums i e a cationic and an anionic gum ii functionalizing natural gums before hydrogel synthesis adds desirable groups to the polymer backbone and iii synthesis of hydrogels from anionic natural gums with cationic monomers and cationic natural gums with anionic monomers in this manner it can be concluded that further investigation emphases on the intrinsic interaction of nanofiller with antimicrobial gum polysaccharide are vital to explore more viable applications in the future declaration of competing interest none

the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction discharge of hazardous materials containing pollutants over permitted limits has caused environmental damage for years 1 5 these hazardous materials natural or man made threaten human health due to their toxicity 6 these include dyes heavy metals herbicides and pesticides these environmental contaminants caused chronic disorders and slowed learning capability and development in children analytical science focuses on the efficient elimination of food and environmental contaminants 7 identifying the optimal treatment strategy for removing dyes from wastewaters and enhancing treated wastewater quality requires knowledge of wastewater composition source and procedure 8 trace amounts of pollutants have been removed from wastewaters employing innovative treatment methods these techniques are for example chemical precipitation electro dialysis 9 electrochemical reaction 10 ion exchange 11 coagulation flocculation 12 membrane filtration 13 and reverse osmosis 14 although each of these techniques possesses several limitations like generation of excess sludge high capital or working costs and low efficiency these are unseemly in use by small scale industries 15 adsorption is preferred over alternative methods because it is efficient fast and responsive to toxic pollutants 16 18 additionally it has cheap start up costs produces nontoxic byproducts and is comparatively easy in terms of activity and treatment unit design additionally it has cheap start up costs produces nontoxic byproducts and is comparatively easy in terms of activity and treatment unit design 19 20 adsorbent nature and type have an impact on adsorption efficiency both inorganic and organic

of glycosidic bonded carbohydrate polymers that come from naturally occurring sources animal polysaccharides plant polysaccharides and microbial polysaccharides are the three main categories of polysaccharides in recent years gum polysaccharides have been investigated for drug delivery systems emulsifiers stabilizers and thickeners in cosmetics lithography pharmaceuticals and textiles 33 34 since gum polysaccharides have multiple functionalities in their chemical structure hydrogels based on gums adsorb pollutants from aqueous solutions such as dyes heavy metal ions and oils 35 36 the fundamental benefit of employing hydrogels derived of gum polysaccharides as adsorbents is that they are environmentally friendly other benefits include responsiveness to pollutant nature with the exception of chitosan most gum polysaccharides are anionic which means that removing effectively cationic pollutants like cationic dyes e g malachite green methylene blue rhodamine b 37 and heavy metal cations like cu2 hg2 cd2 pb2 38 39 however chemically modified gum polysaccharides likewise exhibit potential for removing anionic pollutants specifically anionic dyes e g methyl orange and

arabinose galactose glucuronic acid and xylose composition of monosaccharide units type of bonding and polymerization extent govern soluble nature fluidity gelation power and surface qualities natural gums are eco friendly abundant cheap and biocompatible but their limited mechanical strength limits their usage in industrial applications attributed to the prevalence of different functional groups they are amenable to being transformed into more robust materials hydrogels are more mechanically stable than native gums while yet being biodegradable as natural gums there is such a wide variety of

polysaccharides effective biodegradable materials for the elimination of organic and inorganic pollutants are antimicrobial gum polysaccharides these materials need to be modified in order to get around various downsides they have like dropping in viscosity when stored microbial contamination thickening and an unregulated rate of hydration 115 116 these modifications can be done via carboxymethylation carbamoylethylation cross linking or grafting of vinyl monomers onto polysaccharides which yield a customized material for the required application certain modifications such as carboxymethylation and carbamoylethylation by substitution of scarce free oh groups rises the aqueous solubility of gums 117 it ought to be noticed that several old materials vie effectively today after almost a century of efforts to replace them carboxymethylation of gums enhance their hydrophilicity solution clarity and solubility in aqueous systems various procedures could change polymer molecular interactions fundamentally two procedures are accessible as the physical approach and chemical approach physical technique uses gamma radiation dry heat 118 microwave radiation 119 uv radiation 120 121 and saturated steam to contact polymers molecularly whereas in chemical approach polymers are treated with chemicals such as aldehydes borax epichlorohydrin enolates or glutaraldehyde one of the best methods for cross linking is temperature since it avoids using potentially toxic chemicals in large scale production as well as a wide range of approaches and methodologies in their use 122 table 3 shows examples of modified gums grafting of acrylic acid or its derivatives on gums has been utilized for modifying the swelling characteristics chemical modification of guar gum 123 and gum arabic 124 and other gums through grafting has gotten impressive consideration for bestowing new functional groups for various applications grafting of gums with ions or other polymers requires accessibility of coo as well as ch2oh functional groups in the gum the most significant benefit of grafted gums is the ability to tailor the resulting molecule to produce matrices with a specific characteristic the grafted molecule could be chosen such that it doesn t solubilize while the gum solubilizes at a specific ph gum cross linking needs the presence of active functional groups in their basic structural components 125 subsequently gums for instance guar gum sterculia gum that have free alcoholic and or carboxylic units appear to be a good choice for modification by cross linking 4 antimicrobial activity of gum polysaccharides due to the wide range of infections and diseases the presence of hazardous microbes in the context of human health has become a major issue rapid antibiotic resistance makes the problem worse 136 the effects of microbial contamination adhesion persistence and colonization on surfaces are now harmful to society and public health materials with antimicrobial activity are being investigated for the elimination of pollutants as a means of resolving these problems 137 although antimicrobial materials can prevent or eliminate the bacteria on their surface or in their immediate environment they have severe clinical shortcomings including inadequate antimicrobial effectiveness problems with microbial resistance and difficulty working in a dynamic environment for this a variety of antimicrobial agents are employed an antimicrobial agent could be antiviral antifungal or antibacterial each one acts to inhibit the infection via a different way of action antimicrobial action can be explained as a collective term for all active principles agents that prevent the formation of microbial colonies inhibit the growth of bacteria and may destroy microorganisms consequently to fulfill the challenges in environmental applications there is a need for durable and effective antibacterial materials wide ranging uses for antimicrobial polymers exist in the realm of pollution elimination due to biocidal diffusion microbes are quickly able to develop resistance to traditional antimicrobials which can lead to environmental pollution and human toxicity these issues with microbial contamination can be addressed by antimicrobial polymeric materials because of their features such as enhancing antimicrobial efficacy and lowering residual toxicity their adaptable macromolecular chemistry facilitates the tailoring of polymer physicochemical properties to be used in pollutants removal 138 polymeric materials antibacterial capabilities can be enhanced chemically or by adding inorganic organic antimicrobial agents 137 139 gum polysaccharides have been combined with various nano fillers including metals and metal oxides such as au ag ag2o cuo tio2 mgo and zno as well as carbon and organic based nano fillers for use in a variety of applications including the biomedical environmental and textile industries 140 142 potential applications in the removal of pollutants have been attracted by antimicrobial nano fillers incorporated into gum polysaccharide matrices 142 antibacterial silver nanoparticles ag nps have received much interest for removing pollutants due to their unique activity against microbial attacks and long shelf life however there is a lot of interest in using ag nps with controlled size and shape to enhance the antibacterial property effective frameworks for the generation of uniformly dispersed size controlled ag nps are polymeric hydrogels for the synthesis of hydrogels the appropriate polymers and co monomers have been used and their physico chemical characteristics were precisely influenced not only by controlling ag nps size and shape in the presence of reducing agents but also by controlling ag np release at the site of action an antibacterial modified tg graphene oxide composite hydrogel has been synthesized and used as an adsorbent for the removal of pb 2 cd 2 and ag from wastewater hydrogel containing ag nps has been exploited to investigate antibacterial activity against gram positive staphylococcus aureus bacterium according to the findings under similar circumstances the silver nanocomposite hydrogel had a greater inhibitory effect 14 0 mm than the h6 hydrogel 9 0 mm fig 1 a the presence of nanosize ag nps in the hydrogel matrix which may diffuse out and interact with the lipid layer of bacterial cell membranes may be the cause of this improved antibacterial activity 143 sharma et al 144 have successfully synthesized gum acacia poly acrylamide ipn acrylic acid based nanocomposite hydrogels as prepared hydrogels were tested against three bacterial strains staphylococcus aureus escherichia coli pseudomonas aeruginosa for their antibacterial fig 1 b properties different levels of antibacterial activity were seen with both bacteria and fungi in the produced hydrogels in comparison to semi ipn ipn nanocomposite hydrogels demonstrated significant potential for preventing bacterial growth variable antibacterial action of hydrogels may be due to differences in cell wall of bacteria peptidoglycan and fungi chitin glucans mucopolysaccharides as well as cell wall composition of gram negative p aeruginosa and e coli and gram positive s aureus antimicrobial activities of gums having propitious sorption properties for organic inorganic pollutants are summarized in table 4 5 hydrogels hydrogels are macromolecular network structures that can imbibe expand and retain water without disintegrating these structures can be generated from hydrophilic polymers that are either naturally occurring or synthetically produced the degree of cross connecting and hydrophilic functionality that is present in the structure of the hydrogels is what gives them their resistance to dissolution and swelling capabilities 153 polymer hydrophilicity allows hydrogels to absorb water and the cross linking that exists between the various polymer networks ensures that the hydrogels are resistant to disintegrating fluid additionally plays a significant job in shaping some of the peculiar characteristics of hydrogels 154 there are a lot of different materials both naturally occurring and man made that satisfy the requirements of hydrogels on the other hand researchers are becoming familiar with new approaches and methods in order to create hydrogels with significantly improved biocompatibility mechanical properties super porous nature hybrid hydrogels grafted hydrogels and high stability fast response triblock copolymers imitating hydrogels have a bright future 5 1 classification of hydrogels the hydrogels types and classification are comprehensive and thus can be classified on myriad bases such as their sources of origin natural or synthetic origins 155 their configurations physical structure and chemical composition amorphous crystalline or semi crystalline its synthetic composition type such as interpenetrating polymeric hydrogel ipn homo polymeric and copolymeric its physical appearance and the nature of crosslinking junctions chemical or physical apart from this classification some other categories are also possible 156 the interactions among the polymer webs in the hydrogel is the root of another class a chemical or permanent hydrogel is attained when the interaction among polymer web or network is covalently crosslinked though the formation of molecular interactions and or secondary forces including hydrogen bonding hydrophobic interaction and ionic contact are linked to the reversible or physical type of hydrogel hydrogel which is derived from a single kind of monomer elementary unit of any polymer are referred as homopolymeric hydrogels homopolymeric hydrogels form crosslinked chemical conformation based on their monomer nature and polymerization technique copolymeric hydrogels consist of monomeric units each with a hydrophilic component these monomeric units can be arranged in a number of distinct patterns such as an alternating or block configuration or in a randomly arranged chain of polymer webs an innovative class of hydrogel known as interpenetrating polymeric hydrogel ipn is obtained when two independent components natural or synthetic crosslink in network formation hydrogels may exist in ionic or neutral form depending upon the charge present on the crosslinked chains 157 5 2 methods for hydrogels preparation there are many different approaches to creating hydrogels due to the concept of crosslinking polymer chain molecules the polymer chains may be cross linked by the use of a crosslinker the use of chemical modification the application of grafting or even through the application of high energy radiation such as gamma or ultraviolet rays using a conservative and efficient radical polymerization process hollow core shell particles and hydrogels with a variety of compositions morphologies and sizes are produced hydrogels can be made more useful by increasing the activity of functional groups either within or on their surface there are two sorts of crosslinking techniques used by different researchers or scientists to create hydrogels chemical crosslinking and physical crosslinking in spite of the fact that physical interactions take place between the polymer chains that make up hydrogel chemical methods can form covalent bonds between hydrogel polymer chains each cross linking technique has advantages and disadvantages of its own it is interesting to note that hydrogels developed using covalent crosslinking techniques tend to be more brittle than those created using mild physical crosslinking techniques these hydrogels are stabilized by weak connections between networks of polymer molecules such as hydrogen bonds hydrophobic interactions or ionic interactions 158 fig 2 shows hydrogel synthesis scheme 5 2 1 chemical methods physically crosslinked hydrogels have the advantage of forming gels devoid of any chemical modification or crosslinking agents but they also have limitations the main problem which is closely related to several other features is the mechanical strength of hydrogels permanent covalent connections are associated in chemical crosslinking leading to more stable hydrogels with increased mechanical strength although chemical cross linkers may introduce toxicity issues 5 2 1 1 crosslinking previously in chemical cross linked hydrogel various cross linkers namely glutaraldehyde ga epichlorohydrin ech adipic acid dihydrazide aad polyethylene glycol peg in situ generated cross linker and polyaldehydes pahs are extensively employed to attain cross linked hydrogel networks of several natural polymers 159 160 in attempt to develop this type of cross link a new molecule that possesses reactive functionality is inserted in between the polymeric chains this enables for the cross link to be established in addition covalent linkages can be generated between polymer chains through the reaction of functional groups such as an amine carboxylic acid reaction an isocyanate oh nh2 reaction or the production of a schiff base 161 aldehydes including formaldehyde acetaldehyde and glutaraldehyde are often utilized as crosslinkers in hydrogel crosslinking other aldehydes may also be used however glutaraldehyde causes to increase the toxicity of hydrogel constraining their application in order to fix such concerns researchers in situ produced a unique biocompatible cross linker that utilized polysaccharide as its basic material this biocompatible cross linker was found to be a superior replacement for chemical cross linker in the production of biocompatible hydrogels it has been suggested that the formation of dialdehyde groups from polysaccharide by periodate oxidation is a secure and effective biocompatible cross linker 162 163 monitoring the level of oxidation is one way to exercise control over the degree of cross linking that occurs condensation crosslinks two functional group containing molecules this process also produces other byproducts like water in addition to the big molecules chemically cross linked gels can also be formed from low molecular weight monomers by radical polymerization in the presence of a cross linking agent this is one of the enzyme catalyzed cross linking reaction is indeed a unique in situ hydrogel fabrication technique that replaces traditional cross linking techniques mostly used for synthesizing hydrogels this is a very efficient system even under benign circumstances that causes the gel to form quickly this system can be epitomized by using the free radical initiator such as ammonium persulfate aps or potassium persulfate kps in the synthesis of hydrogel 164 165 radiation cross linking is one of the additional types of chemical cross linking enzyme catalyzed cross linking reaction is another new technology for in situ hydrogel fabrication that offers an inventive replacement for traditional cross linking techniques microbial transglutaminases enzyme that catalyzes the amide bond formation between γ carboxamide group and the primary amine groups has been extensively explored in hydrogel preparation 166 167 enzyme cross linking is beneficial for natural polysaccharides that cannot withstand strong chemical conditions 168 5 2 1 2 grafting hydrogels developed by bulk polymerization typically have a weak structural foundation grafting a hydrogel onto a more durable substrate improves its mechanical characteristics grafting involves covalently polymerizing a polymer s backbone or adding a monomer to it 169 either use of such chemical reagents or high energy radiation treatment will activate the polymer chains chemical grafting involves chemical initiators such potassium persulfate benzoyl peroxide etc to activate polymer chains whereas irradiation grafting uses high energy radiation γ radiation to produce a free radical followed by polymerization via free radical polymerization 83 170 as a result when functional monomer is grafted onto activated polymer chains branching and cross linking occur one of the most significant ways to improve natural gums qualities and broaden the scope of their applications is by chemical alteration which is accomplished through grafting starch has been used and exploited as a superabsorbent hydrogel by grafting it with hydrophilic monomers like acrylic acid acrylamide and acrylonitrile 171 172 173 sadeghi and co workers developed the vinylic monomers acrylamide acrylic acid and methacrylic acid grafted κ carrageenan based superabsorbent hydrogel and investigated the consequence environment parameters such as salinity and ph on the swelling capacity the swelling degree exhibits maximum water absorbency at ph 8 with ph sensitivity they found that in highly basic and saline solution the charge screening effect took over and reduced swelling 174 a variety of polymeric supports have been used for the synthesis of hydrogel by grafting techniques 175 5 2 2 physical methods physical crosslinking comprises of numerous physical interactions between polymer networks such as hydrogen bonding hydrophobic interaction ionic interaction and stereo complex formation resulting in hydrogel formation 153 due to the lack of an external crosslinker physical crosslinking methods in hydrogel chemistry have developed into a significant tool in recent years the absence of crosslinker in polysaccharide gum based hydrogels sustains their biocompatibility and low toxicity thus upholding the benefits of their usage reversible hydrogel is provided via physical crosslinking but there may be structural flaws or non homogeneity as a result of free chain ends literature suggests that few methods are employed to achieve physically crosslinked hydrogels are described below 5 2 2 1 complex coacervation polyanionic and polycationic polymers form coacervate gel this approach allows inversely charged polymers to aggregate into complex structures depending on solution concentration and ph 176 lalevee et al developed highly stretchable hydrogels based on chitosan and hyaluronic acid through complex coacervation 177 in mechanical properties the fragile at ph pka of chitosan amine groups state of hydrogel changes to strong and flexible at ph pka of hyaluronic acid carboxylic groups hydrogel when there are salt ions na k and so forth stable gels form in aggregates because of repulsion of sulfonic group so3 5 2 2 2 freeze thawing in particular biocompatible and non toxic polysaccharides based gels has been synthesized by freeze thaw technique 178 in this method polymers freeze at extremely low temperatures before melting at ambient temperature which leads to formation of microcrystals in the structure of hydrogels the final property of the hydrogel can be achieved by various parameters such as freezing timing changing the ph temperature thawing rate and thawing cycle count however by treating the gels to repeated freeze thaw cycles or by lowering the temperature to 80 c the gels tensile strength can be increased 5 2 2 3 hydrogen bonding hydrogen bonding interactions may create physically crosslinked gel like structures the best example of such hydrogel is investigated by chen et al which shows formation of stronger hydrogen bonding between poly vinyl alcohol pva and tannic acid ta 179 the strong h bonding acts as permanent and robust cross links between pva and ta moreover the weaker h bonding between pva chains as reversible or temporary cross links 5 2 2 4 hydrophobic interaction the generation of crosslinked bonds with hydrophobic interaction is a more effective and superior method for the synthesis of hydrogels at high temperatures hydrophobic interactions take place in amphiphilic polymer solutions this method involves mixing hydrophobic monomers like blocks and hydrogels to hydrophobic monomers improve the hydrogel stability researchers have established that hydrophobic bonds between hydrophobic chains function as reversible crosslinks and can effectively eliminate crack energy 180 the energy dissipation due to these reversible crosslinking prevents hydrogel fracture as a result by adding hydrophobic monomers chains become more entangled and disperse energy more evenly when load is applied 181 5 2 2 5 ionic crosslinking or ionic interaction hydrogel formed by the crosslinking of di tri valent counter ions of ionic polysaccharides fall in this class this approach illustrates the notion of gelling a polyelectrolyte solution by adding conjugated ions with oppositely charged non uniformity in the structure makes it harder to control the gelation frequency which is a significant disadvantage although hydrogel can be crosslinked at ambient temperature under mild conditions or physiological ph hydrogels therefore are frequently used as the matrix for the encapsulation of living cells 182 counterions like calcium ions can crosslink sodium alginate kuo et al developed alginate hydrogel by ion crosslinking of calcium carbonate caco3 calcium chloride dihydrate cacl2 2h2o and calcium sulfate dihydrate caso4 2h2o along with d glucono δ lactone 183 as the concentration of counter ions and temperature rise the gelation degree becomes low at greater alginate concentrations mechanically stronger hydrogel with uniform structure through slow gelation 6 investigation and measurement techniques for hydrogels adsorption capabilities 6 1 hydrogel swelling measurement hydrogel effectiveness depends on the water absorption thus influences the pollutants adsorption the hydrogel s ability to absorb more water improves the adsorption of contaminants however the mechanical strength of the hydrogel is diminished with excessive swelling it is simple for contaminants to enter hydrogels when they are transported by water the most popular method for calculating hydrogel swelling is weight measurement with this method a particular amount of hydrogel wdry is submerged in deionized water and deionized water is released over a predetermined period of time frames filter paper absorbs the water on the surface and wwet weighed this method continues until water absorption stabilizes differences in dry and wet hydrogel weights are used to calculate the equilibrium water absorption quantity as mentioned in eq 1 184 1 water uptake w wet w dry w dry 100 crosslinker ph and temperature are the most influential factors in water absorption of hydrogel 6 2 analyzing and evaluating the adsorption of contaminants by hydrogel the fact that a quantitative analysis of the hydrogels adsorption rate proves their use makes it important a metal ion or dye solution is kept in contact with the hydrogels in a batch condition at a predefined concentration to determine the adsorption capacity until to the equilibrium adsorption amount is reached visible spectrophotometry is used to determine the concentration of contaminants still present in the solution as one of several parameters the subsequent relationships are utilized to determine the removal efficiency r retention capacity qr equilibrium adsorption

the polymer amount of metal ion in feed 100 in the relationships mentioned above c e is the contaminant s ultimate concentration c o is its initial concentration v is the volume of the solution and w is the weight of dry hydrogel 185 the amount of adsorbent concentration contact time temperature ph and ionic strength of the contaminating solution are all factors that affect the hydrogels ability to absorb contaminants adsorption kinetics is an essential part of the adsorbent design process high adsorption capacity and high adsorption rate are required of an adsorbent for industrial usage the amount of contaminant adsorption is evaluated at timed intervals and the adsorption rate is calculated by fitting the data to various models standard models for studying hydrogels adsorption of contaminants include elovich 186 intraparticle diffusion ipd 187 pseudo second order pso 188 and pseudo first order pfo 189 table 5 demonstrates the linear and nonlinear forms of these models in order to understand the kinetic model controlling the process it is necessary to first understand the adsorption mechanism as shown in table 5 it is quite evident that the pseudo second order which describes adsorption by electrostatic interaction governs a major percentage of the adsorption process by hydrogels as the adsorption process reaches equilibrium distribution of adsorbed molecules in the solid and liquid phases are shown by adsorption isotherms 190 the adsorption isotherm is estimated at constant temperature by calculating the equilibrium adsorption capacity and equilibrium concentrations typically isotherms are employed to examine the adsorption process comprising freundlich 191 langmuir 192 redlich peterson 193 and temkin 194 where r2 linear regression coefficient decides the governing model table 6 shows the mathematical equation for these isotherms if linearly and non linearly the most well known isotherm is langmuir isotherm due to its consistency with experimental data table 6 the feasibility and mechanism of the adsorption process are determined by the investigation of thermodynamic parameter variation during the adsorption process the standard enthalpy change h standard entropy change s and standard free gibbs energy of g which are given by the accompanying relationship are the thermodynamic parameters 6 ln k c h rt s r 7 g h t s in the above relations r is gas constant t is absolute temperature and kc is equilibrium constant s and h are obtained by the intercept and slope of the lnkc versus 1 t plot respectively 195 the g determines the feasibility of the process whereas negative g value shows the spontaneity of adsorption process positive and negative values of h shows endothermic and exothermic adsorption processes respectively the increase in randomness at the interface between the gel and the polluted solution throughout the adsorption process is determined by positive values of s 196 197 6 3 determination of the adsorption mechanism by hydrogels although it is a difficult and complex task to describe the heavy metals and dyes adsorption mechanism by hydrogels it s crucial to study how heavy metals and dyes are removed from adsorbents many scientists suggest that the greater part of adsorption mechanism of heavy metals and dyes onto the hydrogels depends upon their chemical structure and their interactions such as complexation ion exchange electrostatic interaction hydrogen bonding hydrophobic interaction and the combination of several suggested mechanisms 198 nh2 groups of chitosan are responsible for adsorption of ny dye and cu 2 by chitosan montmorillonite hydrogel 199 at ph 5 6 ny dye adsorbs to hydrogel electrostatically because nh2 groups are in protonated structure nh3 as ph rises nh3 groups convert to nh2 groups as nitrogen atoms donate its electron lone pair with ny dye and cu 2 200 pb 2 adsorption process on sodium alginate carboxymethyl cellulose gel beads includes 1 electrostatic interaction the surface of the gel bead is negatively charged while the heavy metal ions that cause pollution are positively charged 2 complexation given that o in oh and coo of gel beads could impart its lone pair electron to pb 2 particles 201 hydrogen bonding attraction between imines groups rch nr of dye and hydroxyl groups oh of hydrogel and electrostatic contact between carboxylate groups on hydrogel and cationic dye may account for the adsorption of methyl blue mb on sodium alginate cl poly acrylic tio2 hydrogel 202 different techniques were recommended to regulate adsorption system for example ftir xrd sem edx and xps examining the results of the experiments both before and after the contaminants are adsorbed reveals details concerning the adsorption mechanism 6 4 study of the regeneration and reusability of hydrogels the most important characteristics of a hydrogel for any application are its recuperative and reuse properties in addition to requiring recovery a hydrogel is likely to have a high rate of absorption and capacity in order to be economically cheap usually acid or alkaline solutions are used to regenerate hydrogels 198 key factors in hydrogel regeneration include selecting the appropriate solution volume concentration and optimum time the quantitative estimation of desorption efficiency is achieved by the associated relationships 8 desorption efficiency mdesorbed msorbed 100 c r v r c o c e v 100 9 desorption ratio q q e in the above relations m desorbed is the quantity of desorbed pollutant from hydrogel m sorbed is the

concentration of the contaminated solution v r is volume of the regeneration solution v is volume of the feed solution q e is the adsorption capacity and q is the desorption capacity to examine the hydrogels reusability adsorption and desorption tests should be performed in multiple successive cycles 128 203 7 applications of gum based hydrogels as adsorbents hydrogels adaptability and versatility make them useful in many situations and contexts due to their water content hydrogels are flexible enough for industrial use fig 3 illustrates a few of the approaches in which hydrogels can be placed to use 7 1 adsorption of heavy metal ions apparently low quantities of heavy metal cations in water can have negative impacts on both human health and aquatic life 204 205 the primary causes of hazardous heavy metals presence in surface waterways are untreated industrial effluents and soil erosion 206 207 in the past few years different methods such as membrane separation electrochemical treatment coagulation and flocculation have been used to remove dangerous heavy metals from polluted water sources in the past few years different methods such as membrane separation ion exchange electrochemical treatment coagulation and flocculation have been used to remove dangerous heavy metals from polluted water sources however the adsorption approach has drawn a lot of attention due to its ease of use low cost and ability to remove even extremely small amounts of harmful heavy metals from wastewaters 208 210 toward this path adsorbents based on antimicrobial biopolymers got extraordinary consideration due to their earth favorable nature high adsorption efficiency and low costs gum polysaccharide based adsorbents have been extensively used to remove

whole temperature range this suggests that monolayer chemisorption is most common on the structurally stable gtiniamsa surface ma et al 212 developed a double network hydrogel adsorbent named rh cts pam with macroporous structure and high buried water content this hydrogel was employed to remove toxic pb 2 cu 2 and cd 2 in individual and multicomponent systems fig 4 c in individual systems the initial concentration of 200 mg pb 2 cu 2 cd 2 l achieved with the theoretical qmax of 374 32 196 68 and 268 98 mg g respectively in 10 min while in multicomponent systems pb 2 cu 2 and cd 2 showed lower adsorption rates and capacities than in individual systems according to the authors findings the adsorption process was dominated by oxygen and nitrogen containing functional groups primarily by chemical interaction with a tiny amount of physical interaction recently orange peel biochar based hydrogel composite namely guar gum acrylamide orange peel biochar ggamb hydrogel has been prepared and employed for uranium vi decontamination fig 4 d the uranium vi uptake was studied as a function of solutions ph ggamb dose temperature uranium vi concentration and contact time equilibrium adsorption was noted at 150 min and qe of uranium vi followed langmuir isotherm model with qmax of 263 2 mg g 1 adsorption mechanism shows that amide and hydroxyl groups are mainly responsible for uranium uptake via the electrostatic interaction mechanism and chemical coordinate bonding 213 the capacity of guar gum treated with salicylhydrazine to remove ni 2 co 2 and cr 3 from aqueous solutions is shown by ma et al 214 the nanocomposite s large specific surface area and hydrophobicity guaranteed its good sorption capacity and ease of separation the sorption equilibrium data were successfully agreed upon with the langmuir model and exceptionally high qe values of 1272 4 748 86 and 521 81 mg g for ni 2 cr 3 and co 2 respectively were obtained 7 2 adsorption of dyes the effluents from the textile industry are full of poisonous dyes which have an adverse effect on both human health and oceanic biota s ability to photosynthesize synthetic dyes have mutagenic hazardous and carcinogenic properties 239 due to their high water solvency dyes are largely nondegradable and cannot be broken down in sludge processing facilities 240 242 hydrogels composed of gum polysaccharides are promising adsorbents that have been used to clean up wastewater 243 hydrogels based on gums like guar xanthan gum ghatti and gum karaya have recently been used to remove different dyes from wastewater anionic functional groups such as hydroxyl and carboxylic acid groups are present in the majority of gum polysaccharides they consequently absorb cationic dyes like rhb mv and mb even very high concentrations of cationic dyes can be removed by hydrogels made from natural gums 33 71 low dye concentrations exhibited chemical sorption high concentrations demonstrated physical sorption metal oxides and nanoparticles such as fe3o4 sio2 tio2 graphene and carbon nanotubes increase the adsorption capabilities of natural gum hydrogels mittal et al 244 modified gk cl p aa co aam sio2 based hydrogel nanocomposites were used for the adsorption of mb from aqueous solution the prepared hydrogel exhibited enhanced surface area 299 78 m2 g 1 after incorporation of sio2 particles

shows mb removal by gk cl p aa co aam nanocomposite hydrogel significant surface area and chemical structural functionalities gave the hydrogel nanocomposite high adsorption ability some natural gum based hydrogel as adsorbents for anionic and cationic dyes are recorded in table 8 in another study the adsorption capability of new magnetic poly vinyl alcohol modified gum katira graphene oxide hydrogel beads to remove both cationic crystal violet cv and anionic congo red cr dyes was tested glutaraldehyde ga was used as a crosslinker and it was reported that on increasing the concentration of ga the solubility decreased while the mechanical stability of the as prepared hydrogel composites was enhanced adsorption isotherms are found to be well explained through the langmuir adsorption isotherm with qmax of 94 0 and 101 74 mg g for cv and cr respectively the as synthesized hydrogel can also adsorb heavy metal ions such as pb 2 and cu 2 from wastewater with excellent qmax values of 81 78 and 69 67 mg g respectively 128 chaudhary et al 246 has also been studied for the removal of both cationic auramine o auro and anionic eriochrome black t ebt dyes fig 5 b for this they have prepared a hybrid material i e gum xanthan psyllium hybrid backbone graft co polymerized with polyacrylic acid co polyitaconic acid gp cl p aa co it hydrogel and used it as an adsorbent the dye removal efficiency of 90 53 for ebt and 95 63 for aur o onto the gp cl p aa co it was reported at an initial dye concentration of 30 and 15 mgl 1 for ebt and auro respectively with gp cl p aa co it dose of 600 mg within a time duration of 5 h and 323 k temperature adsorption mechanism study showed that adsorption of cationic aur o dye onto the surface of gp cl p aa co it undergoes via electrostatic interaction dipole dipole hydrogen bonding and cation cation exchange fig 5 b while adsorption of anionic ebt onto the surface of gp cl p aa co it majorly occurred by dipole dipole hydrogen bonding followed by electrostatic interactions fig 5 b very recently wen and co workers 247 have successfully synthesized a novel polymethacryloyl hydrazone modified guar gum adsorption material gsa gsa exhibited an abundant porous structure and was found to be an excellent adsorbent for the selective adsorption of cationic dyes methylene blue mb malachite green mg with high qmax of

glutaraldehyde cross linked chitosan alginate composite cs f an g al were also employed to sequestrate bg dye with the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity qmax of 235 82 mg g 249 7 3 adsorption of pesticides organophosphorus pesticides opps have become one of the most often used pesticides in agriculture during the past few decades mostly since strict restrictions on organochloride pesticides in the 1970s 281 282 opps were widely used due to their outstanding efficacy against a variety of pests and ectoparasites including flies lice and fleas accessibility and relatively low cost 281 while using these pesticides carelessly have environmental and health consequences by contaminating water supplies soil and agricultural products they do have the benefit of increasing crop productivity 283 recent studies have identified several opps effects as being mutagenic carcinogenic and neurotoxic 284 insecticides containing chlorpyrifos or o diethyl o 3 5 6 trichloro 2 pyridyl phosphorothioate are widely used in agriculture cities and homes 285 chlorpyrifos like other opps irreversibly inhibits the cetylcholinesterase acetylcholine is a chemical that sends messages between nerve cells in the brain and the rest of the body as a result acetylcholinesterase inhibition impairs the proper functioning of both the human and animal neurological systems 286 287 additionally the outcomes of recent investigations have revealed that they might adversely affect the differentiation and replication of brain cells 288 dna synthesis 289 and altering normal cellular growth and differentiation by inducing intracellular oxidative stress in certain tissues 290 291 as a consequence it is important to address this insecticide s removal from contaminated water for environmental and human health numerous types of adsorbents like metal oxide nanoparticles polymer based nanocomposites activated carbon have been utilized as adsorbents to remove opps among these adsorbents antimicrobial gum based hydrogel adsorbents have also been studied these include the development of zinc silver implanted montmorillonite integrated chitosan and ggh nanocomposites for the removal of dichlorvos from water 292 at ph 7 and ph 9 ggh and cs based nanocomposites absorbed the maximum dichlorvos at 30 c dichlorvos removal from all composites was greatest below this temperature activity may have diminished due to a lack of attraction force ggh cs and lactic acid modified montmorillonite cuo composites remove dichlorvos 293 at basic ph lactic acid and cs composites were more effective at adsorbing dichlorvos though when the ph increased the degree of dichlorvos adsorption by ggh composites decreased with increasing ph cs and lactic acid composites anionic surface charge became more evident increasing interaction between cationic dichlorvos and anionic composites and adsorption the hydronium ions h3o on the ggh composite surface are present at lower ph levels and strengthen the electrostatic interaction leading to greater adsorption for cs ggh and lactic acid composites the adsorption equilibrium of dichlorvos was attained after 5 5 and 12 h respectively after dichlorvos was quickly removed the rate eventually decreased the quantity of active sites on the composites initially increased and subsequently declined the greatest adsorption was seen in all of the composites at 30 c and then dropped past the ideal threshold the reduction in available active sites or the attractive forces among dichlorvos and composites may be the cause of the decreased adsorption above the optimal temperature cs lactic acid and ggh composites all showed the greatest levels of adsorption at concentrations of dichlorvos of 80 60 and 40 mg l 1 respectively the availability of sufficient pesticides supports the adsorption at a specific concentration however owing to the advent of an equilibrium between pesticides and composites there is no discernible improvement in adsorption beyond this concentration thakur et al 294 developed bentonite incorporated salg dextrin cl paa hydrogel matrix paraquat an extremely hazardous herbicide can be removed with this hydrogel composite fig 6 a the maximum measured removal capacities were 76 923 mg g for salg dextrin cl paa and 90 909 mg g for sa dextrin cl paa bentonite the langmuir isotherm and pseudo second order pso models best describe

organophosphorus pesticide opp chlorpyrifos from aqueous solutions fig 6 b experimental adsorption data were well understood by the langmuir isotherm model and excellent qmax of the ag g pao cufe2o4 for chlorpyrifos was found 769 23 mg g authors hypothesised that electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding were primarily responsible for the chlorpyrifos s adsorptive attachment to the ag g pao cufe2o4 hydrogel biosorbents 295 the removal of another opp i e diazinon was studied using biocomposites of chitosan and carbon nanotube cnt named chn cnt crosslinked with glutaraldehyde this study shows that the incorporation of mwcnt into chitosan increases the mechanical properties of the as prepared biocomposites results showed that chn cnt could remove 82 5 of the diazinon at an initial concentration of 5 mg l a low amount of 0 5 g l of chn cnt dose a contact time of 60 min and ph 5 5 further results indicated that the adsorption isotherm was well explained by the sips isotherm model where the heterogeneity factor n 0 66 indicated heterogeneous adsorption characteristics with a qmax of 222 86 mg g the chn cnt gels were reused after many adsorption desorption cycles 296 the removal of 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid from aqueous solution was studied by using chitosan based hydrogel cbh and chitosan magnetite based composite hydrogel cmch as adsorbent by batch method adsorption

capacities were 75 29 and 45 33 mg g for chitosan based hydrogel and chitosan magnetite based composite hydrogel respectively besides a thermodynamic study showed that the removal of 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid is an endothermic process also the authors studied the removal of 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid using as prepared hydrogels from real world samples such as fortified lake water samples and claimed that hydrogels showed excellent removal behavior they reported that in real world samples hydrogen bonding occurs between 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and hydrogel materials 297 sharma et al 257 used guar gum crosslinked soya lecithin nanohydrogel sheets gg crosslinked sy nhs to remove thiophanate methyl fungicide from aqueous solution guar gum and soy lecithin were used as the biopolymers for the development of nanohydrogel sheets because of their non toxic nature ease of availability low cost and important features the authors stated that good adsorption findings were attained due to the presence of highly reactive functional groups on the surface of gg crosslinked sy nhs the adsorption isotherm data demonstrated the langmuir adsorption isotherm for thiophanate methyl onto the gg crosslinked sy nhs with qmax of 59 205 mg g in another study chitin based nanohydrogel namely chitin cl poly acrylamide co itaconic acid nanohydrogel was successfully developed and employed to sequestrate atrazine from wastewater atrazine adsorption over prepared nanohydrogels were accomplished at a neutral ph in 180 min the nanohydrogel showed qmax of about 204 08 mg g 1 and sorption process was justified by the langmuir isotherm and pseudo second order kinetic models the maximum interactions between the nanohydrogel and atrazine occurred at ph 7 where the surface of the nanohydrogel is positively charged and atrazine is negatively charged authors claimed that chitin cl poly acrylamide co itaconic acid nanohydrogel can be successfully used upto 6th

implying a monolayer of po4 3 zonatto et al 301 prepared arabic gum based hydrogel for adsorption application and controlled release of nutrients such as potassium phosphate and ammonia increasing initial material concentration increases potassium phosphate and ammonia adsorption capabilities contributory explanations included the existence of active sites on the hydrogel network nutrient size and ionic charge the electrostatic interactions lewis acid base interaction and ligand exchange all were significant contributors to the adsorption process dai et al 302 have synthesized a

magnetization intensity and good stability were all displayed by m iacbs in the ph range of 4 to 8 the langmuir model was followed by the beads phosphate adsorption demonstrating that monolayer adsorption was predominant the fitting generated a maximum phosphate adsorption capacity of 18 5 mg g the adsorption mechanism in effective removal of phosphate from water by m iacbs is due to ligand exchange and electrostatic attraction fig 7 c in order to remove nitrate sulphate and phosphate the effectiveness of an aqueous extract of powdered guar gum seed cyamopsis tetragonoloba duckweed fronds spirodela polyrhiza and indian plum leaves ziziphus mauritiana was investigated by pandey and co workers 304 authors claimed that he crude extract of guar gum seed indian plum leaves and

of oils in recent decades oil leakage incidences recurrently occur such incidence releases the oil into ecosystem which endanger the human life and causing irreversible long term harm to natural ecosystems significant research has been put into developing gum based hydrogel as adsorbents to solve the petroleum pollution 305 for instance ramakrishnan and co workers 306 developed a lightweight conjugate sponge containing sa and kg which effectively remove crude oil with maximum adsorption capacity value of 28 5 g g from water fig 8 a the synthesized sa kg bio based adsorbent showed excellent reusability structural stability and mechanical integrity with 90 diesel adsorption efficiency after ten regeneration cycles a greener option for cleaning up oil spills in water is provided by the biodegradable sponge made from renewable resources which degrades 92 in 28 days and eliminates secondary pollution from sponge disposal in another study gum tragacanth acrylic acid based hydrogel was used to adsorb crude oil from aqueous solution for the adsorption of oil from aqueous solutions the effects of ph contact time acrylic acid and glutaraldehyde concentration were studied compared to other hydrogels made with different amounts of acrylic acid the one made with 40 acrylic acid had a big advantage when it came to absorbing crude oil the maximum adsorption occurs in an acidic environment which can be explained by the fact that an acidic environment causes oil to become unstable and that gum tragacanth has a physiochemical effect that appears to demulsify the emulsion increase droplets size and thus improve oil adsorption 307 saruchi et al 308 developed a novel hydrogel of gum tragacanth acrylic acid methylmethacrylate gt g poly aa mma using glutaraldehyde as crosslinker gt g poly aa mma was exploited to adsorb crude oil from aqueous solution the effects of parametric adjustment in the gt g poly aa mma dosage 1 5 g contact time 0 150 min crude oil concentration 5 25 g l ph 3 7 and 10 agitation speed 100 500 rpm and temperature 20 80 c on the adsorption of crude oil were investigated adsorption isotherm study revealed that the adsorption of crude oil onto the gt g poly aa mma followed langmuir isotherm there are three steps involved in the oil adsorption onto the gt g poly aa mma adsorbent oil molecules first diffuse onto the adsorbent surface then into its pores and finally onto the interior surface of gt g poly aa mma the first steps of the adsorption process depend on the amount of contact time and crude oil present the last phase which determines the pace is a rather quick procedure scheverín and co workers 309 synthesized gum arabic concentration 15 and 50 w w based hydrogels incorporated with magnetic nanoparticles and

dyeing gas paint paper pesticides pulp and resin industries the presence of phenols in water deteriorates the amphibian climate low amounts of these pollutants are dangerous for instance phenolic

adsorption process the adsorption by the r g ch beads followed the pseudo second order and the langmuir isotherm models with maximum adsorption capacities of 188 6 and 99 mg g for phenol and 4 chlorophenol respectively badruddoza et al 327 have synthesized a magnetic cellulose gum based hydrogel material namely carboxymethyl β cyclodextrin polymer modified magnetic nanocomposites cm β cd and used it to remove bpa from aqueous solutions grafting of carboxymethyl β cyclodextrin polymer onto magnetic nanoparticle surface leads to an improvement of the adsorption capacity of fe3o4 nanoparticles due to robust complexation of the multiple oh and cooh groups in carboxymethyl β cyclodextrin polymer with the hydrophobic cavity of organic contaminants through host guest interactions

researchers have paid a lot of attention to natural gums as intriguing rare materials to create adsorbents for wastewater treatment because of their superior adsorption efficiency low cost nontoxicity biocompatibility biodegradability and biological activity yet there are numerous research uncertainties and gaps in the future additional pertinent research will be required to fill these knowledge gaps natural gum based hydrogel is being used in lab studies to simulate wastewater treatment but the real wastewater treatment frequently deviates greatly from the lab simulated wastewater treatment for instance actual wastewater generally contains a variety of contaminants metals dyes phenols pharmaceuticals and oils this suggests that forthcoming studies of natural gum based adsorbents would examine how well they remove many pollutants rather than just one additionally it is crucial to remove these various pollutants at the same time it is possible to reuse both the adsorbents and the contaminants that have been absorbed second adsorbent performance can be greatly impacted by differences in temperature and ph between the laboratory and the natural environment a simple approach to predicting the best conditions and applicability of natural gum based adsorbents underneath the real wastewater treatment system is to fit the properties of the real contaminant removal environment and laboratory adsorption data into machine learning models third natural gum based adsorbent manufacturing procedures require improvement since many synthesizing processes are restricted to labs and difficult to industrialize it is required to develop a method that is not only quick and simple but also economical and effective in the construction of polysaccharide based wastewater adsorbents overall manufacturing operation expenses extensive production pollutant resource recycling reuse adaptation to complicated situations and wasted adsorbent management ought to be subjected to rigorous industrial applications of natural gum based adsorbents 9 conclusion water pollution is a major cause of worry for everyone the treatment of wastewater prior to its release is of the utmost importance yet providing a universal technique for eliminating all contaminants from wastewater remains difficult the use of antimicrobial gums for pollutants removal is alluring because they are biocompatible capable of chemical modifications conceivably biodegradable and scarcely with any special cases economical promptly accessible and non toxic still they have problems like low surface area and weak mechanical strength that make them difficult to use in different industrial applications the text reviews the most up to date natural gum based hydrogels this review examines the different types of natural gum based hydrogels used to make adsorbents the methods of crosslinking principles of adsorbent design and the technical feasibility of using natural gum based hydrogels as adsorbents to remove pollutants from wastewater natural gums based hydrogels carry the potential in wastewater adsorption to eradicate organic inorganic pollutants recent work has shown that hydrogels made from natural gums have a lot of potential used in proper cleaning the property profile and adsorption performance of composites of hydrogels based on natural gums with other nanofillers were significantly enhanced hydrogels made from natural gums are quite effective at absorbing pollutants but they still need work in the areas of mechanical strength recycling structural integrity and pollution selectivity the fundamental problem of employing natural gums based hydrogels as adsorbents in water purification is their restricted adsorption toward charged pollutants i e either cationic or anionic hence it is necessary to design hydrogels based on natural gums that can simultaneously adsorb cationic and anionic pollutants hydrogels can be synthesized or developed to address this issue i by utilizing two distinct types of natural gums i e a cationic and an anionic gum ii functionalizing natural gums before hydrogel synthesis adds desirable groups to the polymer backbone and iii synthesis of hydrogels from anionic natural gums with cationic monomers and cationic natural gums with anionic monomers in this manner it can be concluded that further investigation emphases on the intrinsic interaction of nanofiller with antimicrobial gum polysaccharide are vital to explore more viable applications in the future declaration of competing interest none 
12674,nanofiltration nf membranes have been extensively employed for the treatment of textile wastewater to produce clean water due to their capability of retaining small organic molecules in this study zwitterionic loose nanofiltration z nf membranes have been successfully fabricated by the rapid co deposition of dopamine and diamine zwitterion z dnma via covalent bonds the fabricated z nf membranes show improved hydrophilicity and enhanced fouling resistant ability due to the incorporation of the zwitterionic functionality following the systematic investigation on the ratio between dopamine and z dnma as well as the co deposition time the identified optimum membrane z nf3 exhibits a high pure water permeability pwp of 32 0 lmh bar 1 and high organic dye rejections of 99 7 and 98 6 for congo red cr and methyl blue mb respectively in addition the fouling experiments of z nf3 show that the flux recovery ratios frrs for the filtration of bovine serum albumin bsa sodium alginate naalg and cr are 99 1 92 0 and 82 2 respectively along with lower irreversible fouling ratios rir and higher reversible fouling ratios rr values compared to those of the control membrane the high pwp and high rejections to organic dyes coupled with its superior fouling resistant performance indicate its great potential for practical applications in the treatment of textile wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords nanofiltration membrane dye separation dopamine zwitterion fouling resistance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water scarcity exacerbated by climate change and anthropogenic pollution is threating the ecological system human health and sustainable development of human society 1 2 especially the pollution caused by the organic dyes from printing and dyeing industry is becoming increasingly severe 3 printing and dyeing industry as one of the most polluting industries produces a massive amount of wastewater containing organic dyes annually causing severe impacts on the aquatic ecosystem and chronic toxicity to human body 4 therefore the highly efficient and effective technologies for the production of clean water are intensively required the conventional methods including adsorption flocculation and coagulation have been widely used for wastewater treatment 5 8 however these methods generally require additional reagents and exhibit low sensitivity with extensive energy consumption for instance electrocoagulation processes require the energy consumption of 2 24 kwh kg 1 cod chemical oxygen demand removed 9 apart from them membrane separation technologies as emerging alternative approaches have attracted tremendous attention for the pretreatment of wastewater desalination of seawater and production of potable water due to their versatile properties including low energy consumption e g 3 4 kwh m 3 for the desalination with reverse osmosis membranes high separation efficiency and selectivity easy scale up and no phase transfer 10 11 nanofiltration nf membranes as one of the pressure driven separation technologies are capable of retaining small organic molecules showing great merits in the treatment of wastewater from textile industry 12 the state of the art nanofiltration membranes are thin film composite tfc membranes fabricated through the classical interfacial polymerization however the current tfc membranes often suffer from relatively low permeability and fouling propensity which mainly result from the dense thin film selective layer and its inherently hydrophobic property respectively over the development of the past decades significant progress has been achieved towards enhancing the membrane permeability selectivity and fouling resistant ability among them incorporating nanomaterials within the thin film selective layer is one of the most attractive strategies for nf membrane fabrication to date numerous nanomaterials have been developed to enhance nf membrane performance including carbon based nanomaterials graphene oxide reduced graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes plant based nanomaterials cellulose nanocrystals and cellulose nanofibers and other types of nanomaterials mxene nanosheets covalent organic frameworks and metal organic frameworks these nanomaterials can be incorporated into thin film layer during the interfacial polymerization 13 or pre loading on the supporting layer before the interfacial polymerization as an interlayer to form a sandwich structure 14 15 or coating on the porous supporting membrane directly to fabricate nf membranes 16 17 despite the progress the limited permeability and compromised selectivity are still the restricting factors for the membranes by these strategies for practical applications due to the incompatibility between the nanomaterials and polymer matrices to tackle this an improved alternative strategy is to construct the thin film selective layer with a loose structure by employing the unique mussel inspired chemistry in this regard tremendous achievements have been made since its first report on membrane surface modification with this unique strategy in 2007 18 dopamine as the most representative building block in the mussel inspired chemistry has been extensively employed for the surface coating engineering including filtration membranes biomedicines electronics and batteries 19 22 based on the previous researches the functionality of mussel inspired chemistry is ascribed to the abundant 3 4 dihydroxy l phenylalanine in mussel foot proteins which involves covalent polymerization and non covalent self assembly under mild oxidative conditions 18 23 24 in addition to the essential catechol structure for mussel inspired chemistry amine groups are also vital to facilitate the formation of covalent polymerization via michael addition reaction and schiff base reaction 25 the increased proportion of covalent bonds in the coating layer can enhance the stability and hydrophilicity simultaneously which are conducive to the membrane performance on the basis of this understanding numerous derivatives with a similar catechol structure from dopamine and their co deposition with other amine abundant polymers e g polyethylenimine have been proposed for the fabrication of loose nf membranes including catechol tannic acid gallic acid and epigallocatechin gallate 26 30 however the time consuming polymerization process and the limited hydrophilicity of coating layer still impede their applications in the fabrication of membranes tackling these challenges different strategies have been developed to accelerate the oxidation and polymerization speed including the use of copper sulfate hydrogen peroxide potassium persulfate and uv irradiation 31 35 in addition to improving the polymerization efficiency co depositions of dopamine with other zwitterions without amine functionalization via non covalent assembly have been reported to improve the hydrophilicity of coating layer 36 however the non covalent assembly process of dopamine and zwitterions can not only decrease the polymerization efficiency but also the coating layer stability recently a few studies on the covalent grafting of amine functionalized zwitterions with polydopamine via a rapid co deposition for the surface modification of ultrafiltration membranes have been reported to improve fouling resistant ability 37 38 however this has not yet been attempted thus far for loose nf membranes on the basis of the earlier studies we hypothesize that the co deposition of dopamine with diamine zwitterions via covalent polymerization is also a promising strategy for the fabrication of loose nf membranes of improved performance herein we propose a rapid bio inspired strategy to construct a thin film selective layer by the co deposition of a diamine zwitterionic monomer z dnma with dopamine via covalent bonds z dnma is conveniently synthesized by the protection of amine group from 3 3 diamino n methyldipropylamine dnma and the ring open reaction of tertiary amine group in dnma with 1 3 propane sultone followed by the de protection of amine group 39 the two primary amine groups from z dnma are able to form covalent bonds with polydopamine via michael addition reaction and schiff base reaction during the rapid co deposition of cuso4 h2o2 triggered polymerization the fabricated loose nf membranes with the incorporated zwitterionic structure from z dnma show enhanced surface hydrophilicity an optimization of the co deposition parameters has been undertaken to obtain the optimum loose nf membrane with superior fouling resistant performance towards both typical hydrophobic contaminants e g proteins and organic molecules e g organic dyes the promising results obtained in this study including pure water permeability pwp dye rejection and fouling resistant performance indicate its potential application not only in the fabrication of membranes for the treatment of wastewater from textile industries but also the surface functionalization in other engineering areas via this rapid covalent co deposition

at 40 c for 8 h after that the mixture was washed with di water followed by evaporation of chloroform to obtain z dnma boc the final compound z dnma was obtained by the de protection of z dnma boc in hcl aqueous solution 4 0 m at room temperature the mixture was washed with acetonitrile to remove impurities followed by the freeze drying to obtain the final solid z dnma 2 3 membrane fabrication zwitterionic loose nf z nf membranes were fabricated by a rapid co deposition of dopamine and z dnma or dnma via cuso4 h2o2 trigged oxidation firstly a pes ultrafiltration membrane was immersed in di water for at least 24 h in order to get the membrane surface completely wetted then the wetted membrane was fixed into the lab designed framework which only allows the top surface of pes ultrafiltration membrane to contact with the following co deposition solution of dopamine and diamine monomers dnma or z dnma the co deposition solution was prepared by adding dopamine 2 0 mg ml 1 into a tris hcl buffer solution 50 mm ph 8 5 followed by the addition of a different amount of z dnma or dnma considering that the prepared diamine zwitterion z dnma is a hydrochloride shown in fig 1a the dissociated hcl may cause a ph deviation of tris hcl buffer solution therefore a proper tuning of ph to 8 5 was performed by adding a diluted hcl 0 5 m or naoh 0 5 m aqueous solution afterwards cuso4 5 mm and h2o2 19 6 mm were added into the co deposition solution sequentially 31 the final solution was poured into the framework with a pes ultrafiltration membrane and shaken on a shaker under

12 mw 0 557 mw 35 000 where r is the stoke radius mw is the molecular weight of pegs the pore size distribution is determined by the following equation 40 2 dr r p d r p 1 r p ln σ p 2 π exp ln r p lnμ p 2 2 ln σ p 2 where rp is the stoke radius of peg μp is the mean effective pore radius σp is the geometric standard deviation the mwco is defined as the molecular weight of peg having a rejection

c p c f 100 where cp and cf are peg concentrations in the permeate and feed solutions respectively 2 5 membrane separation performance all membrane separation performance tests were conducted at 6 0 bar using a stirred dead end filtration cell at a stirring speed 350 rpm the effective area of membrane filtration was 12 56 cm2 the nf membranes were compacted at 7 0 bar with di water for around half an hour to reach a steady state before each testing in this study a series of dye and salt solutions at a concentration of 100 ppm and 1 g l 1 respectively was employed as feed solutions if there

of filtration with different model foulants which were bsa 1 0 g l 1 in pbs buffer solution at ph 7 4 naalg 1 0 g l 1 and cr 100 ppm respectively firstly pwp was recorded as the original permeability j 0 for 0 5 h then di water was replaced with a corresponding model foulant the filtration permeability j 1 was recorded every 5 0 min for 1 0 h the normalized flux j 1 j 0 was employed to quantify the fouling resistant ability during the filtration process after 1 0 h of filtration the fouled membrane was cleaned by hydraulic wash with di water for 2 0 h followed by the measurement of pwp again j 2 this whole process was repeated three times flux recovery ratio frr reversible fouling ratio rr and irreversible fouling ratio rir are calculated according to the following equations 6 frr j 2 j 0 100 7 r r j 2 j 1 j 0 100 8 r ir j 0 j 2 j 0 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis and characterization of z dnma the diamine zwitterion z dnma is synthesized herein according to a previously reported study with some modifications 39 as shown in fig 1a the two primary amine groups in dnma are firstly protected with boc butyloxycarbonyl to obtain dnma boc to prevent from the reaction of these primary amine groups with 1 3 propane sultone in the next step then the boc protected zwitterionic structure z dnma boc is formed by the ring open reaction of dnma boc and 1 3 propane sultone the subsequent de protection of z dnma boc under hcl aqueous solution renders z dnma in the hydrochloride form the chemical structures of dnma and the synthesized z dnma have been characterized with 1h nmr spectroscopy fig 1b shows the 1h nmr spectrum of dnma where the singlet peak c at 2 11 ppm s 3h is ascribed to the methyl group next to the tertiary amine group the triplet peaks a and b at 2 53 ppm t 4h and 2 34 ppm t 4h and multiplet peak d at 1 53 ppm m 4h are attributed to the methylene group next to the tertiary amine group the methylene group next to the primary amine group and the middle methylene group respectively fig s1 shows the 1h nmr spectrum of dnma boc therein the singlet peak at 1 37 ppm s 18h is ascribed to methyl groups on tert butyloxycarbonyl boc indicating the successful protection of the primary amine group as shown in fig 1c after the introduction of zwitterionic moiety into dnma one can see that all the 1h nmr peaks seen in dnma shift to the relatively lower fields higher chemical shifts in the spectrum of z dnma due to the formation of the quaternary ammonium group in z dnma in addition the new peaks at 3 47 ppm 2 92 ppm and 2 11 ppm integrated with peak d are ascribed to the three methylene groups in the 1 3 propane sultone moiety therefore these 1h nmr results demonstrate the successful synthesis of z dnma 3 2 fabrication and characterization of loose nf membranes loose nf membranes have been fabricated by a rapid co deposition of dopamine with z dnma or dnma via cuso4 h2o2 trigged oxidation which can accelerate the polymerization rate and reduce the coating time 31 fig 2 shows the water contact angle wca of the fabricated membranes one can see that the pristine pes membrane has a relatively high wca value of around 80 due to the inherent hydrophobicity of pes after the deposition of polydopamine or co deposition of polydopamine with diamine monomers dnma and z dnma wca decreases dramatically to less than 55 among the membranes other than pes nf0 has a relatively high wca 49 6 value due to the limited hydrophilicity of polydopamine with the co deposition of dopamine and dnma at a mole ratio of 1 1 nf3 shows a slightly higher wca 53 1 compared to nf0 49 6 however z nf3 prepared at the same mass ratio but with z dnma z dnma dopamine 1 1 shows a much lower wca 30 0 meanwhile prepared at the reduced z dnma dopamine mole ratio of 1 0 5 z nf2 shows an increased wca of 42 8 compared to z nf3 these results indicate the successful formation of the coating layer and the enhanced hydrophilicity after the co deposition with z dnma surface elemental compositions of loose nf membranes have been characterized with xps as shown in fig 3 all three membranes nf0 nf3 and z nf3 show the characteristic peak of n 1s originating from dopamine and diamine monomers and the peak of cu 2p due to the trace amount of cu2 residual on the membrane surface by the chelation with the amine group from dopamine 33 in addition one can observe that all three membranes show the peak of s 2p resulting from the pes substrate the pristine pes membrane has a sulfur content of around 5 41 as shown in table 1 nf0 shows a decreased sulfur content of 3 4 after the sole coating of dopamine indicating the formation of polydopamine layer on the pes surface compared to nf0 z nf3 shows an increased sulfur content of 4 2 due to the co deposition of dopamine and sulfur containing z dnma furthermore as shown in table 1 the increased n c ratios of nf3 and z nf3 also indicate the successful incorporation of both diamine monomers dnma and z dnma the surface morphologies of the pristine pes ultrafiltration membrane and the fabricated membranes have been characterized with sem and afm as shown in fig 4a the sem image of pristine pes membrane shows a relatively smooth surface compared to the pes membrane one can observe the obvious grainy surfaces after the deposition of dopamine and diamine monomers due to the formation of polydopamine aggregates fig 4b e in addition nf3 and z nf3 fig 4c e show increased quantities of polydopamine aggregates than nf0 fig 4b which is mainly ascribed to the addition of diamine monomers since extra amine functional groups can facilitate the polymerization of dopamine by the formation of covalent bonds 25 as shown in fig 4e z nf3 fabricated from the co deposition solution with a highest diamine monomer content exhibits the coarsest surface among all membranes which further indicates the significance of diamine monomers for the formation of dopamine coating layer the afm images from fig 4a e show that the pristine pes has the lowest surface roughness ra 6 59 nm among all membranes nf0 possesses the highest surface roughness with ra of 16 74 nm while other modified membranes have relatively lower surface roughness this is mainly ascribed to the addition of amine monomers and the formation of covalent bonds 24 the increased portion of covalent bonds can effectively reduce the size of polydopamine aggregates thus produce a relatively smooth surface 3 3 separation performance of loose nf membranes the separation performance of the fabricated loose nf membranes including pwp and the filtration performance of bsa aqueous solution has been systematically investigated as shown in fig 5a the pristine pes ultrafiltration membrane shows the highest pwp 54 4 lmh bar 1 after the deposition of dopamine nf0 shows a decreased pwp of 47 8 lmh bar 1 due to the formation of polydopamine coating layer on the pes membrane compared to nf0 with a single component polydopamine coating loose nf membranes fabricated with the co deposition of dopamine and z dnma also show decreased pwps which are mainly caused by the formation of crosslinked zwitterionic networks via covalent bonding as shown in fig 1d specifically pwp decreases from 42 9 lmh bar 1 for z nf1 to 32 0 lmh bar 1 for z nf3 with the increase of z dnma concentration indicating the formation of the denser coating layer in addition compared to nf3 z nf3 prepared at the identical diamine monomer concentration shows a relatively higher pwp 32 0 lmh bar 1 mwco results in fig s2 show that nf3 has a lowest value 1850 da while z nf2 and z nf3 have relatively higher mwcos of 3692 and 2166 da respectively in addition with the increased ratio of z dnma dopamine from 0 5 z nf2 to 1 0 z nf3 mwco decreases from 3692 da to 1850 da as shown in fig s3 pore size distribution gets narrowed with the increased ratio of z dnma dopamine the decreased mwco and narrowed pore size distribution are mainly ascribed to the increased content of z dnma which facilitates the formation of covalent bonds in the coating layer fig 5b shows the bsa filtration performance of loose nf membranes including the normalized permeability for 0 5 h filtration and flux recovery ratio frr after a hydraulic washing with di water for around 2 h it shows that the pes membrane has the lowest normalized permeability and frr 64 4 among all membranes due to the inherent hydrophobicity of pes after the polydopamine coating nf0 exhibits a slightly enhanced frr of 67 1 despite that the polydopamine coating helps improve the fouling resistant ability to some extent the limited hydrophilicity still restricts its further application in the modification of membrane surface with the incorporation of z dnma on can observe that the normalized permeability increases dramatically from around 50 to 70 while frr increases significantly from around 70 to 95 in addition with the increase of z dnma concentration the normalized permeability and frr increase gradually from 72 4 to 75 2 and 87 5 to 97 7 respectively furthermore nf3 fabricated from dnma shows the lower normalized permeability and frr compared to z nf3 69 7 vs 75 2 85 5 vs 97 7 respectively indicating the enhanced fouling resistant ability with the incorporation of z dnma in addition to the impact of diamine monomer concentration the effect of the co deposition time on the membrane performance has also been conducted under the z dnma dopamine molar ratio of 1 1 which was used for the fabrication of z nf3 as shown in fig 5c with the coating time reduced from 60 min to 30 min pwp increases from 32 0 lmh bar 1 to 42 5 lmh bar 1 however the normalized permeability and frr decrease from 75 2 to 61 7 and 97 7 to 79 2 respectively therefore on the basis of the above filtration performance for all nf membranes it can be concluded that the covalent incorporation of z dnma into polydopamine coating endows the nf membranes with increased pwp and enhanced fouling resistant ability in consequence z nf3 has been chosen as the optimum membrane for the following experiments given its high pwp and superior fouling resistant ability to further investigate the filtration performance of the optimum membrane z nf3 three organic dyes cr mb and og with different molecular sizes have been chosen as the model contaminants the detailed information of these three dyes is presented in table s1 as shown in fig 6a the pristine pes ultrafiltration membrane shows much lower rejections to all three dyes cr 93 2 mb 75 7 and og 26 4 while nf3 and z nf3 exhibit enhanced rejections to all three dyes with cr and mb high dye rejections of 99 and 98 respectively have been achieved however with og the dye rejection decreases to around 65 for both nf membranes due to the smaller molecular size of og compared to cr and mb 42 the obtained dye rejections for all membranes especially towards cr are higher than the theoretical values calculated from mwco which are mainly ascribed to the aggregate formation of dye molecules in aqueous solutions 43 44 fig 6b shows that the normalized permeabilities of z nf3 towards all three dyes are appreciably higher than the corresponding ones of nf3 similarly as shown in fig 6c z nf3 also exhibits enhanced frrs compared to the corresponding ones of nf3 especially the frr for cr is dramatically improved from 59 0 for nf3 to 80 8 for z nf3 due to the formation of the hydration layer with the enhanced membrane surface hydrophilicity 45 46 in addition to the filtration of dyes inorganic salts nacl na2so4 mgcl2 and mgso4 have also been used to investigate membrane separation performance of z nf3 as shown in fig s4 the membrane exhibits relatively low rejections to inorganic slats which follow the order of na2so4 mgso4 mgcl2 nacl due to the larger molecular sizes of divalent anions all above results indicate the great potential of z dnma in the construction of fouling resistant membrane surface for the removal of organic dyes 3 4 fouling resistant performance a comparison of the fouling resistant performance between z nf3 and nf3 has been undertaken by undertaking three cycles of filtration of cr 100 ppm bsa 1 0 g l 1 and naalg 1 0 g l 1 to further verify the superior performance of z nf3 as shown in fig 7a both membranes show an obvious permeability decrease in the first cycle due to the concentration polarization and deposition of cr molecules on the membrane surface then it is followed by a relatively slower decrease in subsequent cycles which is mainly ascribed to the deposition of cr molecules on the membrane surface 40 47 after the hydraulic washing with di water for 2 h the frrs are 52 5 and 82 2 for nf3 and z nf3 respectively for the first cycle fig 7b for the following two cycles frr of z nf3 decreases to 74 8 and 71 9 while frrs of nf3 decreases to 43 3 and 41 9 after three cycles of cr filtration the frr value of z nf3 is 71 6 higher than that of nf3 demonstrating the superior fouling resistance of z nf3 to organic dyes furthermore as shown in fig 7c and d z nf3 has a much higher rr and lower rir values compared to those of nf3 for all three cycles which further confirms the enhanced fouling resistance fig 8 shows the fouling resistant performance after three cycles of filtration of bsa solution with the introduction of the zwitterionic moiety in z nf3 one can see a mild decrease in permeability compared to nf3 due to the increased hydrophilicity of membrane surface after the cleaning of membrane surface frr of the first cycle reaches an ultrahigh level of 99 1 while frr of nf3 is only 84 0 during the three cycles of filtration frr of z nf3 decreases slightly from 99 1 to 95 3 demonstrating its superior stability and reusability fig 8b as shown in fig 8c and d rr and rir for bsa fouling follow the same pattern with the cr filtration indicating its superior fouling resistant ability for hydrophobicity contaminants in addition to the filtration of cr and bsa naalg as another typical contaminant has also been employed in order to fully investigate the fouling resistant performance of z nf3 as shown in fig 9a it follows the similar trend observed above in the case with cr and bsa for the three cycles of filtration fig 9b shows the frr values of z nf3 and nf3 one can see that the pristine nf3 has a lower frr 87 7 compared to z nf3 92 0 for the initial cycle and it dramatically decreases to 75 5 in the third cycle while the frr of z nf3 can still maintain at 84 5 the higher rr in fig 9c and lower rir in fig 9d further demonstrate the enhanced fouling resistant ability of z nf3 to naalg relative to nf3 based on the above results with the three model contaminants cr bsa and naalg it can be concluded that after the introduction of the zwitterionic moiety in z nf3 the fouling resistant ability has been significantly improved towards both hydrophobic contaminants and the deposition of textile organic molecules to highlight the excellent performance of z nf3 fabricated in this study a comparison of the performance in terms of pwp and dye rejection is made see table 2 in reference to reported nf membranes fabricated via various methodologies including the conventional interfacial polymerization polydopamine deposition dopamine involved layer by layer process and dopamine rapid deposition though the nf membranes prepared via the conventional interfacial polymerization generally possess relatively higher dye rejections their pwps are much lower compared to z nf3membrane in this study in addition some of the reported nf membranes fabricated with dopamine deposition also show lower pwps for instance the membrane ga pei fabricated with the co deposition of gallic acid and branched polyethylenimine has a pwp of 8 3 lmh bar 1 with a low azithromycin ah molecular weight 749 0 g mol 1 rejection 96 2 other nf membranes spei10k pei and ta ja 2 pan have comparable pwps and dye rejections as z nf3 in this study however the layer by layer methodology used their fabrication involves intricate processes furthermore the reported membrane rd 1s prepared from a similar rapid deposition non covalent deposition shows a lower pwp and also a lower dye rejection this comparison indicates the superior performance of z nf3 for the potential applications in the treatment of dye contaminated wastewater from textile industries 4 conclusions in summary zwitterionic loose nf membranes have been facilely fabricated through the rapid co deposition of dopamine and diamine zwitterion z dnma by cuso4 h2o2 triggered polymerization the selective layer of z nf membranes is constructed by the covalent bonding of dopamine and z dnma via michael addition reaction and schiff base reaction through the investigation on the effects of the co deposition parameters including the ratio between dopamine and z dnma as well as the co deposition time the optimum membrane z nf3 identified herein shows enhanced hydrophilicity wca of 30 0 a high pwp of 32 0 lmh bar 1 with superior organic dye rejections to cr 99 7 and mb 98 6 the fouling experiments with three cycles of filtration of three model contaminants cr bsa and naalg confirm that z nf3 has an outstanding fouling resistant ability and excellent stability frrs for the first cycle filtration of bsa naalg and cr are 99 1 92 0 and 82 2 respectively with a lower irreversible fouling ratio rir and higher reversible fouling ratio rr values compared to those of the control membrane nf3 the high pwp and high rejection to organic dyes coupled with its superior fouling resistant performance highlight its great potential for applications in the treatment of textile

12674,nanofiltration nf membranes have been extensively employed for the treatment of textile wastewater to produce clean water due to their capability of retaining small organic molecules in this study zwitterionic loose nanofiltration z nf membranes have been successfully fabricated by the rapid co deposition of dopamine and diamine zwitterion z dnma via covalent bonds the fabricated z nf membranes show improved hydrophilicity and enhanced fouling resistant ability due to the incorporation of the zwitterionic functionality following the systematic investigation on the ratio between dopamine and z dnma as well as the co deposition time the identified optimum membrane z nf3 exhibits a high pure water permeability pwp of 32 0 lmh bar 1 and high organic dye rejections of 99 7 and 98 6 for congo red cr and methyl blue mb respectively in addition the fouling experiments of z nf3 show that the flux recovery ratios frrs for the filtration of bovine serum albumin bsa sodium alginate naalg and cr are 99 1 92 0 and 82 2 respectively along with lower irreversible fouling ratios rir and higher reversible fouling ratios rr values compared to those of the control membrane the high pwp and high rejections to organic dyes coupled with its superior fouling resistant performance indicate its great potential for practical applications in the treatment of textile wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords nanofiltration membrane dye separation dopamine zwitterion fouling resistance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water scarcity exacerbated by climate change and anthropogenic pollution is threating the ecological system human health and sustainable development of human society 1 2 especially the pollution caused by the organic dyes from printing and dyeing industry is becoming increasingly severe 3 printing and dyeing industry as one of the most polluting industries produces a massive amount of wastewater containing organic dyes annually causing severe impacts on the aquatic ecosystem and chronic toxicity to human body 4 therefore the highly efficient and effective technologies for the production of clean water are intensively required the conventional methods including adsorption flocculation and coagulation have been widely used for wastewater treatment 5 8 however these methods generally require additional reagents and exhibit low sensitivity with extensive energy consumption for instance electrocoagulation processes require the energy consumption of 2 24 kwh kg 1 cod chemical oxygen demand removed 9 apart from them membrane separation technologies as emerging alternative approaches have attracted tremendous attention for the pretreatment of wastewater desalination of seawater and production of potable water due to their versatile properties including low energy consumption e g 3 4 kwh m 3 for the desalination with reverse osmosis membranes high separation efficiency and selectivity easy scale up and no phase transfer 10 11 nanofiltration nf membranes as one of the pressure driven separation technologies are capable of retaining small organic molecules showing great merits in the treatment of wastewater from textile industry 12 the state of the art nanofiltration membranes are thin film composite tfc membranes fabricated through the classical interfacial polymerization however the current tfc membranes often suffer from relatively low permeability and fouling propensity which mainly result from the dense thin film selective layer and its inherently hydrophobic property respectively over the development of the past decades significant progress has been achieved towards enhancing the membrane permeability selectivity and fouling resistant ability among them incorporating nanomaterials within the thin film selective layer is one of the most attractive strategies for nf membrane fabrication to date numerous nanomaterials have been developed to enhance nf membrane performance including carbon based nanomaterials graphene oxide reduced graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes plant based nanomaterials cellulose nanocrystals and cellulose nanofibers and other types of nanomaterials mxene nanosheets covalent organic frameworks and metal organic frameworks these nanomaterials can be incorporated into thin film layer during the interfacial polymerization 13 or pre loading on the supporting layer before the interfacial polymerization as an interlayer to form a sandwich structure 14 15 or coating on the porous supporting membrane directly to fabricate nf membranes 16 17 despite the progress the limited permeability and compromised selectivity are still the restricting factors for the membranes by these strategies for practical applications due to the incompatibility between the nanomaterials and polymer matrices to tackle this an improved alternative strategy is to construct the thin film selective layer with a loose structure by employing the unique mussel inspired chemistry in this regard tremendous achievements have been made since its first report on membrane surface modification with this unique strategy in 2007 18 dopamine as the most representative building block in the mussel inspired chemistry has been extensively employed for the surface coating engineering including filtration membranes biomedicines electronics and batteries 19 22 based on the previous researches the functionality of mussel inspired chemistry is ascribed to the abundant 3 4 dihydroxy l phenylalanine in mussel foot proteins which involves covalent polymerization and non covalent self assembly under mild oxidative conditions 18 23 24 in addition to the essential catechol structure for mussel inspired chemistry amine groups are also vital to facilitate the formation of covalent polymerization via michael addition reaction and schiff base reaction 25 the increased proportion of covalent bonds in the coating layer can enhance the stability and hydrophilicity simultaneously which are conducive to the membrane performance on the basis of this understanding numerous derivatives with a similar catechol structure from dopamine and their co deposition with other amine abundant polymers e g polyethylenimine have been proposed for the fabrication of loose nf membranes including catechol tannic acid gallic acid and epigallocatechin gallate 26 30 however the time consuming polymerization process and the limited hydrophilicity of coating layer still impede their applications in the fabrication of membranes tackling these challenges different strategies have been developed to accelerate the oxidation and polymerization speed including the use of copper sulfate hydrogen peroxide potassium persulfate and uv irradiation 31 35 in addition to improving the polymerization efficiency co depositions of dopamine with other zwitterions without amine functionalization via non covalent assembly have been reported to improve the hydrophilicity of coating layer 36 however the non covalent assembly process of dopamine and zwitterions can not only decrease the polymerization efficiency but also the coating layer stability recently a few studies on the covalent grafting of amine functionalized zwitterions with polydopamine via a rapid co deposition for the surface modification of ultrafiltration membranes have been reported to improve fouling resistant ability 37 38 however this has not yet been attempted thus far for loose nf membranes on the basis of the earlier studies we hypothesize that the co deposition of dopamine with diamine zwitterions via covalent polymerization is also a promising strategy for the fabrication of loose nf membranes of improved performance herein we propose a rapid bio inspired strategy to construct a thin film selective layer by the co deposition of a diamine zwitterionic monomer z dnma with dopamine via covalent bonds z dnma is conveniently synthesized by the protection of amine group from 3 3 diamino n methyldipropylamine dnma and the ring open reaction of tertiary amine group in dnma with 1 3 propane sultone followed by the de protection of amine group 39 the two primary amine groups from z dnma are able to form covalent bonds with polydopamine via michael addition reaction and schiff base reaction during the rapid co deposition of cuso4 h2o2 triggered polymerization the fabricated loose nf membranes with the incorporated zwitterionic structure from z dnma show enhanced surface hydrophilicity an optimization of the co deposition parameters has been undertaken to obtain the optimum loose nf membrane with superior fouling resistant performance towards both typical hydrophobic contaminants e g proteins and organic molecules e g organic dyes the promising results obtained in this study including pure water permeability pwp dye rejection and fouling resistant performance indicate its potential application not only in the fabrication of membranes for the treatment of wastewater from textile industries but also the surface functionalization in other engineering areas via this rapid covalent co deposition

in dcm 40 ml followed by the addition of boc 2o 44 mmol 9 6 g in dcm 40 ml the mixture was extracted with di water after 12 h of stirring at room temperature dnma boc was obtained as a white solid after evaporating dcm subsequently 1 3 propane sultone 7 0 mmol 0 85 g in chloroform 10 ml was added dropwise into the solution of dnma boc 5 8 mmol 2 0 g in chloroform 10 ml the mixture was stirred at 40 c for 8 h after that the mixture was washed with di water followed by evaporation of chloroform to obtain z dnma boc the final compound z dnma was obtained by the de protection of z dnma boc in hcl aqueous solution 4 0 m at room temperature the mixture was washed with acetonitrile to remove impurities followed by the freeze drying to obtain the final solid z dnma 2 3 membrane fabrication zwitterionic loose nf z nf membranes were fabricated by a rapid co deposition of dopamine and z dnma or dnma via cuso4 h2o2 trigged oxidation firstly a pes ultrafiltration membrane was immersed in di water for at least 24 h in order to get the membrane surface completely wetted then the wetted membrane was fixed into the lab designed framework which only allows the top surface of pes ultrafiltration membrane to contact with the following co deposition solution of dopamine and diamine monomers dnma or z dnma the co deposition solution was prepared by adding dopamine 2 0 mg ml 1 into a tris hcl buffer solution 50 mm ph 8 5 followed by the addition of a different amount of z dnma or dnma considering that the prepared diamine zwitterion z dnma is a hydrochloride shown in fig 1a the dissociated hcl may cause a ph deviation of tris hcl buffer solution therefore a proper tuning of ph to 8 5 was performed by adding a diluted hcl 0 5 m or naoh 0 5 m aqueous solution afterwards cuso4 5 mm and h2o2 19 6 mm were added into the co deposition solution sequentially 31 the final solution was poured into the framework with a pes ultrafiltration membrane and shaken on a shaker under a constant shaking rate of 40 rpm for 1 h if there is no addition illustration the z nf membranes fabricated with z dnma at the z dnma dopamine molar ratios of 0 2 1 0 5 1 and 1 1 were denoted as z nf1 z nf2 and z nf3 respectively while membranes fabricated from the pristine dnma were donated as nf in addition the membrane fabricated with dopamine 2 0 mg ml 1 with no diamine monomers was denoted as nf0 2 4 characterization the chemical structures of dnma and z dnma were characterized with 1h nuclear magnetic resonance 1h nmr bruker 300 mhz water contact angle wca measurements were performed

performed by measuring the rejections of pegs 1 0 g l 1 of different molecular weights 1000 1500 4000 and 6000 da the mean effective pore radius μp is the solute geometric radius when the rejection r 50 while geometric standard deviation σp is the ratio of stoke radius when rejection r 84 13 to that of r 50 the stoke radii of pegs are calculated according to the following equation 40 1 r 16 73 10 12 mw 0 557 mw 35 000 where r is the stoke radius mw is the molecular weight of pegs the pore size distribution is determined by the following equation 40 2 dr r p d r p 1 r p ln σ p 2 π exp ln r p lnμ p 2 2 ln σ p 2 where rp is the stoke radius of peg μp is the mean effective pore radius σp is the geometric standard deviation the mwco is defined as the molecular weight of peg having a rejection of 90 peg concentrations in permeate and feed solutions were determined by the total organic carbon analyzer toc l shimadzu kyoto japan the peg rejection is determined by the following equation 3 r 1 c p c f 100 where cp and cf are peg concentrations in the permeate and feed solutions respectively 2 5 membrane separation performance all membrane separation performance tests were conducted at 6 0 bar using a stirred dead end filtration cell at a stirring speed 350 rpm the effective area of membrane filtration was 12 56 cm2 the nf membranes were compacted at 7 0 bar with di water for around half an hour to reach a steady state before each testing in this study a series of dye and salt solutions at a concentration of 100 ppm and 1 g l 1 respectively was employed as feed solutions if there was no additional illustration the loose nf membrane pure water permeability p lmh bar 1 is calculated by using the following equation 4 p v a t p where v is the volume l of the permeate a is the effective filtration area m2 t is the operation time h and δp is the trans membrane pressure bar the solute rejection r is calculated according to 5 r 1 c p c f 100 where c p and cf are solute concentrations of the permeate and feed dye solutions respectively dye concentration was determined with a uv vis spectrophotometer agilent cary 8454 while salt concentration was measured by using a conductivity meter oakton conductivity meter con 11 series vernon hills il usa 2 6 fouling resistant performance the fouling resistance performance tests were carried out at 6 0 bar with three cycles of filtration with different model foulants which were bsa 1 0 g l 1 in pbs buffer solution at ph 7 4 naalg 1 0 g l 1 and cr 100 ppm respectively firstly pwp was recorded as the original permeability j 0 for 0 5 h then di water was replaced with a corresponding model foulant the filtration permeability j 1 was recorded every 5 0 min for 1 0 h the normalized flux j 1 j 0 was employed to quantify the fouling resistant ability during the filtration process after 1 0 h of filtration the fouled membrane was cleaned by hydraulic wash with di water for 2 0 h followed by the measurement of pwp again j 2 this whole process was repeated three times flux recovery ratio frr reversible fouling ratio rr and irreversible fouling ratio rir are calculated according to the following equations 6 frr j 2 j 0 100 7 r r j 2 j 1 j 0 100 8 r ir j 0 j 2 j 0 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis and characterization of z dnma the diamine zwitterion z dnma is synthesized herein according to a previously reported study with some modifications 39 as shown in fig 1a the two primary amine groups in dnma are firstly protected with boc butyloxycarbonyl to obtain dnma boc to prevent from the reaction of these primary amine groups with 1 3 propane sultone in the next step then the boc protected zwitterionic structure z dnma boc is formed by the ring open reaction of dnma boc and 1 3 propane sultone the subsequent de protection of z dnma boc under hcl aqueous solution renders z dnma in the hydrochloride form the chemical structures of dnma and the synthesized z dnma have been characterized with 1h nmr spectroscopy fig 1b shows the 1h nmr spectrum of dnma where the singlet peak c at 2 11 ppm s 3h is ascribed to the methyl group next to the tertiary amine group the triplet peaks a and b at 2 53 ppm t 4h and 2 34 ppm t 4h and multiplet peak d at 1 53 ppm m 4h are attributed to the methylene group next to the tertiary amine group the methylene group next to the primary amine group and the middle methylene group respectively fig s1 shows the 1h nmr spectrum of dnma boc therein the singlet peak at 1 37 ppm s 18h is ascribed to methyl groups on tert butyloxycarbonyl boc indicating the successful protection of the primary amine group as shown in fig 1c after the introduction of zwitterionic moiety into dnma one can see that all the 1h nmr peaks seen in dnma shift to the relatively lower fields higher chemical shifts in the spectrum of z dnma due to the formation of the quaternary ammonium group in z dnma in addition the new peaks at 3 47 ppm 2 92 ppm and 2 11 ppm integrated with peak d are ascribed to the three methylene groups in the 1 3 propane sultone moiety therefore these 1h nmr results demonstrate the successful synthesis of z dnma 3 2 fabrication and characterization of loose nf membranes loose nf membranes have been fabricated by a rapid co deposition of dopamine with z dnma or dnma via cuso4 h2o2 trigged oxidation which can accelerate the polymerization rate and reduce the coating time 31 fig 2 shows the water contact angle wca of the fabricated membranes one can see that the pristine pes membrane has a relatively high wca value of around 80 due to the inherent hydrophobicity of pes after the deposition of polydopamine or co deposition of polydopamine with diamine monomers dnma and z dnma wca decreases dramatically to less than 55 among the membranes other than pes nf0 has a relatively high wca 49 6 value due to the limited hydrophilicity of polydopamine with the co deposition of dopamine and dnma at a mole ratio of 1 1 nf3 shows a slightly higher wca 53 1 compared to nf0 49 6 however z nf3 prepared at the same mass ratio but with z dnma z dnma dopamine 1 1 shows a much lower wca 30 0 meanwhile prepared at the reduced z dnma dopamine mole ratio of 1 0 5 z nf2 shows an increased wca of 42 8 compared to z nf3 these results indicate the successful formation of the coating layer and the enhanced hydrophilicity after the co deposition with z dnma surface elemental compositions of loose nf membranes have been characterized with xps as shown in fig 3 all three membranes nf0 nf3 and z nf3 show the characteristic peak of n 1s originating from dopamine and diamine monomers and the peak of cu 2p due to the trace amount of cu2 residual on the membrane surface by the chelation with the amine group from dopamine 33 in addition one can observe that all three membranes show the peak of s 2p resulting from the pes substrate the pristine pes membrane has a sulfur content of around 5 41 as shown in table 1 nf0 shows a decreased sulfur content of 3 4 after the sole coating of dopamine indicating the formation of polydopamine layer on the pes surface compared to nf0 z nf3 shows an increased sulfur content of 4 2 due to the co deposition of dopamine and sulfur containing z dnma furthermore as shown in table 1 the increased n c ratios of nf3 and z nf3 also indicate the successful incorporation of both diamine monomers dnma and z dnma the surface morphologies of the pristine pes ultrafiltration membrane and the fabricated membranes have been characterized with sem and afm as shown in fig 4a the sem image of pristine pes membrane shows a relatively smooth surface compared to the pes membrane one can observe the obvious grainy surfaces after the deposition of dopamine and diamine monomers due to the formation of polydopamine aggregates fig 4b e in addition nf3 and z nf3 fig 4c e show increased quantities of polydopamine aggregates than nf0 fig 4b which is mainly ascribed to the addition of diamine monomers since extra amine functional groups can facilitate the polymerization of dopamine by the formation of covalent bonds 25 as shown in fig 4e z nf3 fabricated from the co deposition solution with a highest diamine monomer content exhibits the coarsest surface among all membranes which further indicates the significance of diamine monomers for the formation of dopamine coating layer the afm images from fig 4a e show that the pristine pes has the lowest surface roughness ra 6 59 nm among all membranes nf0 possesses the highest surface roughness with ra of 16 74 nm while other modified membranes have relatively lower surface roughness this is mainly ascribed to the addition of amine monomers and the formation of covalent bonds 24 the increased portion of covalent bonds can effectively reduce the size of polydopamine aggregates thus produce a relatively smooth surface 3 3 separation performance of loose nf membranes the separation performance of the fabricated loose nf membranes including pwp and the filtration performance of bsa aqueous solution has been systematically investigated as shown in fig 5a the pristine pes ultrafiltration membrane shows the highest pwp 54 4 lmh bar 1 after the deposition of dopamine nf0 shows a decreased pwp of 47 8 lmh bar 1 due to the formation of polydopamine coating layer on the pes membrane compared to nf0 with a single component polydopamine coating loose nf membranes fabricated with the co deposition of dopamine and z dnma also show decreased pwps which are mainly caused by the formation of crosslinked zwitterionic networks via covalent bonding as shown in fig 1d specifically pwp decreases from 42 9 lmh bar 1 for z nf1 to 32 0 lmh bar 1 for z nf3 with the increase of z dnma concentration indicating the formation of the denser coating layer in addition compared to nf3 z nf3 prepared at the identical diamine monomer concentration shows a relatively higher pwp 32 0 lmh bar 1 mwco results in fig s2 show that nf3 has a lowest value 1850 da while z nf2 and z nf3 have relatively higher mwcos of 3692 and 2166 da respectively in addition with the increased ratio of z dnma dopamine from 0 5 z nf2 to 1 0 z nf3 mwco decreases from 3692 da to 1850 da as shown in fig s3 pore size distribution gets narrowed with the increased ratio of z dnma dopamine the decreased mwco and narrowed pore size distribution are mainly ascribed to the increased content of z dnma which facilitates the formation of covalent bonds in the coating layer fig 5b shows the bsa filtration performance of loose nf membranes including the normalized permeability for 0 5 h filtration and flux recovery ratio frr after a hydraulic washing with di water for around 2 h it shows that the pes membrane has the lowest normalized permeability and frr 64 4 among all membranes due to the inherent hydrophobicity of pes after the polydopamine coating nf0 exhibits a slightly enhanced frr of 67 1 despite that the polydopamine coating helps improve the fouling resistant ability to some extent the limited hydrophilicity still restricts its further application in the modification of membrane surface with the incorporation of z dnma on can observe that the normalized permeability increases dramatically from around 50 to 70 while frr increases significantly from around 70 to 95 in addition with the increase of z dnma concentration the normalized permeability and frr increase gradually from 72 4 to 75 2 and 87 5 to 97 7 respectively furthermore nf3 fabricated from dnma shows the lower normalized permeability and frr compared to z nf3 69 7 vs 75 2 85 5 vs 97 7 respectively indicating the enhanced fouling resistant ability with the incorporation of z dnma in addition to the impact of diamine monomer concentration the effect of the co deposition time on the membrane performance has also been conducted under the z dnma dopamine molar ratio of 1 1 which was used for the fabrication of z nf3 as shown in fig 5c with the coating time reduced from 60 min to 30 min pwp increases from 32 0 lmh bar 1 to 42 5 lmh bar 1 however the normalized permeability and frr decrease from 75 2 to 61 7 and 97 7 to 79 2 respectively therefore on the basis of the above filtration performance for all nf membranes it can be concluded that the covalent incorporation of z dnma into polydopamine coating endows the nf membranes with increased pwp and enhanced fouling resistant ability in consequence z nf3 has been chosen as the optimum membrane for the following experiments given its high pwp and superior fouling resistant ability to further investigate the filtration performance of the optimum membrane z nf3 three organic dyes cr mb and og with different molecular sizes have been chosen as the model contaminants the detailed information of these three dyes is presented in table s1 as shown in fig 6a the pristine pes ultrafiltration membrane shows much lower rejections to all three dyes cr 93 2 mb 75 7 and og 26 4 while nf3 and z nf3 exhibit enhanced rejections to all three dyes with cr and mb high dye rejections of 99 and 98 respectively have been achieved however with og the dye rejection decreases to around 65 for both nf membranes due to the smaller molecular size of og compared to cr and mb 42 the obtained dye rejections for all membranes especially towards cr are higher than the theoretical values calculated from mwco which are mainly ascribed to the aggregate formation of dye molecules in aqueous solutions 43 44 fig 6b shows that the normalized permeabilities of z nf3 towards all three dyes are appreciably higher than the corresponding ones of nf3 similarly as shown in fig 6c z nf3 also exhibits enhanced frrs compared to the corresponding ones of nf3 especially the frr for cr is dramatically improved from 59 0 for nf3 to 80 8 for z nf3 due to the formation of the hydration layer with the enhanced membrane surface hydrophilicity 45 46 in addition to the filtration of dyes inorganic salts nacl na2so4 mgcl2 and mgso4 have also been used to investigate membrane separation performance of z nf3 as shown in fig s4 the membrane exhibits relatively low rejections to inorganic slats which follow the order of na2so4 mgso4 mgcl2 nacl due to the larger molecular sizes of divalent anions all above results indicate the great potential of z dnma in the construction of fouling resistant membrane surface for the removal of organic dyes 3 4 fouling resistant performance a comparison of the fouling resistant performance between z nf3 and nf3 has been undertaken by undertaking three cycles of filtration of cr 100 ppm bsa 1 0 g l 1 and naalg 1 0 g l 1 to further verify the superior performance of z nf3 as shown in fig 7a both membranes show an obvious permeability decrease in the first cycle due to the concentration polarization and deposition of cr molecules on the membrane surface then it is followed by a relatively slower decrease in subsequent cycles which is mainly ascribed to the deposition of cr molecules on the membrane surface 40 47 after the hydraulic washing with di water for 2 h the frrs are 52 5 and 82 2 for nf3 and z nf3 respectively for the first cycle fig 7b for the following two cycles frr of z nf3 decreases to 74 8 and 71 9 while frrs of nf3 decreases to 43 3 and 41 9 after three cycles of cr filtration the frr value of z nf3 is 71 6 higher than that of nf3 demonstrating the superior fouling resistance of z nf3 to organic dyes furthermore as shown in fig 7c and d z nf3 has a much higher rr and lower rir values compared to those of nf3 for all three cycles which further confirms the enhanced fouling resistance fig 8 shows the fouling resistant performance after three cycles of filtration of bsa solution with the introduction of the zwitterionic moiety in z nf3 one can see a mild decrease in permeability compared to nf3 due to the increased hydrophilicity of membrane surface after the cleaning of membrane surface frr of the first cycle reaches an ultrahigh level of 99 1 while frr of nf3 is only 84 0 during the three cycles of filtration frr of z nf3 decreases slightly from 99 1 to 95 3 demonstrating its superior stability and reusability fig 8b as shown in fig 8c and d rr and rir for bsa fouling follow the same pattern with the cr filtration indicating its superior fouling resistant ability for hydrophobicity contaminants in addition to the filtration of cr and bsa naalg as another typical contaminant has also been employed in order to fully investigate the fouling resistant performance of z nf3 as shown in fig 9a it follows the similar trend observed above in the case with cr and bsa for the three cycles of filtration fig 9b shows the frr values of z nf3 and nf3 one can see that the pristine nf3 has a lower frr 87 7 compared to z nf3 92 0 for the initial cycle and it dramatically decreases to 75 5 in the third cycle while the frr of z nf3 can still maintain at 84 5 the higher rr in fig 9c and lower rir in fig 9d further demonstrate the enhanced fouling resistant ability of z nf3 to naalg relative to nf3 based on the above results with the three model contaminants cr bsa and naalg it can be concluded that after the introduction of the zwitterionic moiety in z nf3 the fouling resistant ability has been significantly improved towards both hydrophobic contaminants and the deposition of textile organic molecules to highlight the excellent performance of z nf3 fabricated in this study a comparison of the performance in terms of pwp and dye rejection is made see table 2 in reference to reported nf membranes fabricated via various methodologies including the conventional interfacial polymerization polydopamine deposition dopamine involved layer by layer process and dopamine rapid deposition though the nf membranes prepared via the conventional interfacial polymerization generally possess relatively higher dye rejections their pwps are much lower compared to z nf3membrane in this study in addition some of the reported nf membranes fabricated with dopamine deposition also show lower pwps for instance the membrane ga pei fabricated with the co deposition of gallic acid and branched polyethylenimine has a pwp of 8 3 lmh bar 1 with a low azithromycin ah molecular weight 749 0 g mol 1 rejection 96 2 other nf membranes spei10k pei and ta ja 2 pan have comparable pwps and dye rejections as z nf3 in this study however the layer by layer methodology used their fabrication involves intricate processes furthermore the reported membrane rd 1s prepared from a similar rapid deposition non covalent deposition shows a lower pwp and also a lower dye rejection this comparison indicates the superior performance of z nf3 for the potential applications in the treatment of dye contaminated wastewater from textile industries 4 conclusions in summary zwitterionic loose nf membranes have been facilely fabricated through the rapid co deposition of dopamine and diamine zwitterion z dnma by cuso4 h2o2 triggered polymerization the selective layer of z nf membranes is constructed by the covalent bonding of dopamine and z dnma via michael addition reaction and schiff base reaction through the investigation on the effects of the co deposition parameters including the ratio between dopamine and z dnma as well as the co deposition time the optimum membrane z nf3 identified herein shows enhanced hydrophilicity wca of 30 0 a high pwp of 32 0 lmh bar 1 with superior organic dye rejections to cr 99 7 and mb 98 6 the fouling experiments with three cycles of filtration of three model contaminants cr bsa and naalg confirm that z nf3 has an outstanding fouling resistant ability and excellent stability frrs for the first cycle filtration of bsa naalg and cr are 99 1 92 0 and 82 2 respectively with a lower irreversible fouling ratio rir and higher reversible fouling ratio rr values compared to those of the control membrane nf3 the high pwp and high rejection to organic dyes coupled with its superior fouling resistant performance highlight its great potential for applications in the treatment of textile
