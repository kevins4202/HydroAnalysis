15600,contamination by nanoplastics in urban water has aroused increasing concern the impact of nanoplastic exposure on the wastewater treatment process in the long term is still unclear this study investigated the effect of continuous nanoplastic exposure r1 0 r2 10 r3 100 and r4 1000 μg l on the nitrification and denitrification processes for over 200 days in a sequencing batch reactor sbr the results revealed that nanoplastic exposure does not demonstrate significant inhibition of total nitrogen removal the ammonia oxidation rate 19 24 0 01 mgn gmlvss h p 0 05 and denitrification rate 11 78 0 11 mgn gmlvss h p 0 05 in r4 was significantly lower than the control r1 0 μg l the maximal reaction velocities of n2o reduction vmax were improved after long term exposure to nanoplastics in high concentrations the r3 demonstrated the highest vmax value six times higher than r4 and approximately 20 times higher than r1 and r2 the microbial structure largely varied with the exposure to nanoplastics where the exposure to a high concentration largely suppressed the nitrifier and selectively enriched the denitrifier the percentage of the top 20 genera of denitrifiers increased from 31 76 to 63 42 and the nitrifiers decreased from an initial 12 40 to 2 83 for r4 the predominant genera were found to be thauera azoarcus and defluviicoccus in r4 and r3 which indicated their tolerance to nanoplastics the function prediction results indicated that the membrane transport function was significantly enhanced and the lipid metabolism function was significantly reduced in r4 as compared with the control r1 p 0 05 this may be attributed to the adsorption of nanoplastics on bacteria observation under a scan electronic microscope demonstrated that the nanoplastics were firmly attached to the microbe surface and aggregated in activated sludge at high nanoplastics dosed reactor these results deepen the understanding of the effect of nanoplastics on the urban wastewater treatment process and provide valuable information for the management of nanoplastic contamination in urban wastewater keywords nanoplastics urban wastewater nitrification denitrification nitrous oxide microbial mechanism data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the contamination of urban water by nanoplastics has aroused worldwide attention kumar et al 2021 mitrano et al 2019 most of the studies have focused on contamination in the aquatic ecosystem shen et al 2019 koelmans et al 2015 cai et al 2021 whereas its occurrence and effect on urban wastewater treatment plants wwtps have rarely been reported studies on nanoplastics are limited due to the controversy regarding their definition and their accurate detection sobhani et al 2020 mohana et al 2021 delgado gallardo et al 2021 the most widely accepted definition of nanoplastics is that they are plastics with sizes of 1 1000 nm junaid and wang 2021 mitrano et al 2021 hartmann et al 2019 wwtps are an important source of nanoplastics where the microplastics are broken into nanoplastics enfrin et al 2019 it is also an important sink considering domestic sewage brings a large number of nanoplastics into wwtps such as those released from personal care products ppcps enfrin et al 2020 ali et al 2021 hernandez et al 2017 the fate of nanoplastics in wwtps is complicated including but not limited to 1 them being newly produced from microplastics through weathering processes such as breaking hydrolysis degradation oxidation and so forth mohana et al 2021 kim et al 2020 2 participating in the nitrification and denitrification process with activated sludge besseling et al 2019 reported that the concentration of nanoplastics could be 1014 times higher than the concentration of microplastics the role of nanoplastics in the wastewater nitrogen cycling process is not clear yet studies focusing on the effect of nanoplastics on the wastewater nitrification and denitrification process is limited earlier literature has investigated the effect of nanoplastics on nitrogen removal in a constructed wetland system it was reported that polystyrene nanoplastics with concentrations of 1 and 10 mg l have an insignificant effect on cod removal but significantly inhibit total nitrogen tn removal 7 15 the high abundance of polystyrene nanoplastics could probably produce reactive oxygen species ros and lead to oxidative stress in the system as implied by the researchers xu and tsang 2022 the major functional bacteria related to nitrogen cycling in the system were also negatively affected by polystyrene nanoplastics ma et al 2022b another study that investigated the concentrations of polystyrene nanoplastics at 0 10 and 1000 μg l also reported a decrease in tn removal 29 5 40 6 accompanied by a decrease in the relative abundance of nitrifiers and denitrifiers yang et al 2020b recent studies have compared the effect of microplastics and nanoplastics on nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment where it was only hindered by nanoplastics due to their characteristics the removal of nh4 n was decreased by 24 48 at nanoplastic concentrations of 1000 μg l zhou et al 2022a yang et al 2022 compared the exposure of nanoplastics to wetland systems of different sizes and concentrations where the ammonia removal was decreased by 7 6 71 2 it may be concluded that the long term exposure to nanoplastics decreased the microbial richness and diversity the ros oxidation stress is the most widely accepted explanation for nanoparticle toxicity mechanism and engineered nanoparticles wang and chen 2016 ma et al 2021 revealed the negative impact and toxic mechanism of nanoplastics on nitrogen cycling in wetlands by metagenomic and enzyme activity analysis it was revealed that high concentrations of nanoplastics significantly suppressed nitrifying enzyme activities the overproduction of ros and antioxidant system variation in macrophytes and microbes are the primary reasons for the toxic mechanism of nanoplastics the toxic impact of nanoplastics and microbial mechanisms on nitrogen removal in domestic wastewater treatment is therefore unclear nitrous oxide n2o is a potent greenhouse gas ghg and also an important intermediate in the nitrogen cycling process ni et al 2013 desloover et al 2012 wwtps are an important hotspot for n2o emission considering n2o is an obligatory byproduct of the heterotrophic denitrification and autotrophic nitrification process foley et al 2010 law et al 2012 although the effect of nanoplastics on n2o emission has rarely been reported the engineered nanoparticles inhibition to n2o emission has been widely studied it was reported that the nitrification process is susceptible to silver nanoparticles and that the denitrification process is related to the size of nanoparticles mcgee 2020 zheng et al 2017 found that the effect of silver nanoparticles on nitrifier n2o production was that of low dose stimulation and high dose inhibition the production of n2o could even be enhanced by over 100 when compared with a control it was suggested that the nitric oxide reductase gene expression was up regulated with the treatment of low dose silver nanoparticles the dose of silver nanoparticles to the nitrification activity and the molecular underpinning was additionally highlighted ye et al 2020 suggested that zno nanoparticles have stronger inhibition of the denitrification process than the nitrification process where the removal of tn and n2o emissions were reduced since the characteristics of nanoplastics are distinguished from engineered nanoparticles due to the high particle heterogeneity composition and morphologies they should be distinct from nanoparticles gigault et al 2021 the effect of nanoplastics on nitrogen cycling and n2o emission in wastewater treatment should therefore be studied this study aims to investigate the effect of long term exposure to nanoplastics on the nitrification and denitrification processes in wastewater treatment the sequencing batch reactor sbr with different doses of nanoplastics in the influent was operated continuously where the nh4 n removal no3 n production and tn removal were detected the n2o reduction rate and the kinetic and production potential under various influent dosages of nanoplastics were analyzed the changes in the microbial community and functional gene abundance variation in each system were also analyzed and compared the results of this study could potentially deepen the understanding of the effect and microbial mechanism of nanoplastics on the nitrogen removal process during wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 setup and operation of the reactors this study used four lab scale sbrs with

decant 1 min and settling 40 min and effluent decanting 12 min the sludge retention time srt was maintained at 15 days for each reactor with 80 ml of mixed liquor wasted per day a magnetic stirrer with 250 rpm was controlled for providing mixing except for the settling and decanting process wang et al 2014 the ph was controlled by a ph controller where it was maintained at 7 0 7 2 using a 1 m nahco3 solution the dissolved oxygen do was maintained above 2 0 mg l during the aeration process and below 0 5 mg l during the anaerobic stage by the do controller the feed water used was simulated wastewater with chemical oxygen demand cod of approximately 450 mg l and nh4 n at 50 mg l the detailed composition of the feed water is listed in table s1 and table s2 besides this separated feed water with different concentrations of nanoplastics 0 10 100 1000 μg l was prepared for each reactor the polystyrene nanoplastics 100 nm 5 w v used were purchased from sigma aldrich shanghai china the polystyrene suspension was diluted progressively to 100 times the designed concentration with milliq water and then diluted to the designed concentration with the simulated wastewater before use the reactors were stably operated for over 200 days during this study 2 2 water quality analysis and denitrification rate assay the nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations in the influent and effluent of the four parallel reactors were analyzed twice a day the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n c were analyzed using spectrophotometric methods the variations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations during a typical cycle in each reactor were measured per month the denitrification rate of the reactors with various nanoplastics added was detected after 120 days of operation and conducted once per two weeks the denitrification rate assay was conducted in a 0 2 l working volume system the feed water used in this assay had an initial no3 n at 100 mg l and cod at 400 mg l table s3 the mixed sludge of volume 0 2 l was collected from each reactor centrifuged at 3000 rpm to remove the supernatant washed with milliq water and centrifuged at 3000 rpm this process was repeated thrice to reduce the interference of experimental error the washed activated sludge from each reactor was mixed with the feed water and then swept with pure n2 99 99 for two minutes to maintain anaerobic condition the systems were then sealed and mixed using a magnetic stirrer this assay was conducted for 120 min and the water sample was collected for 20 min the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n no3 n mlss and mlvss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids were measured after the experiment the mlss and mlvss were measured following standard methods apha et al 2012 the specific denitrification rate was calculated as the ratio of the no3 n reduction rate to the concentration of mlvss unit mg no3 n g mlvss h 2 3 n2o respiration experiment the n2o consumption kinetics of the activated sludge from each sbr with various doses of nanoplastic culture was estimated using a lab scale microrespiration system unisense denmark this system was equipped with a clark type n2o microsensor a microchamber with a volume of 6 ml and a magnetic stirrer installed in the sensor stand online monitoring of dissolved n2o concentration was available with a laptop connected fig s1 a volume of 15 ml of mixed activated sludge from each sbr was collected and washed thrice with milliq water after which10 μl of this mixture was injected into the microchamber with the addition of synthetic water carbon source was provided detail in table s4 the synthetic water was swept with pure n2 99 99 purity xiangyun industry wuhan china before being filled into the microchamber sodium acetate was used as a carbon source where the excess concentration was prepared as synthetic water to control the n2o as the sole limiting substrate the stoichiometric relation between n2o and sodium acetate was assessed using eqs 1 and 2 zhou et al 2021 approximately 20 μl of concentrated n2o solution 25 mmol l was injected into the chamber the n2o solution was then spiked to adjust the initial n2o concentration at 800 μmol l a glass coated stirrer bar was stirred at 400 rpm to provide mixing during the experiments the n2o concentration was recorded for the mixture sludge from each sbr respectively 1 4 n 2 o c h 3 co o 4 n 2 c o 2 hc o 3

the reactor was stable in effluent nitrogen removal performance phase ii the four reactors had been operated for 107 days and the effluent nitrogen removal was stable phase iii the four reactors were operated for 163 days with stable effluent nitrogen removal were analyzed through illumine miseq sequencing the mixture activated sludge in phase i ii and iii of each sbr were then collected the dna was extracted using the dneasy powersoil kit qiagen hilden germany high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna was conducted following previous literature deng et al 2020 the nitrifying and denitrifying functional gene abundance were determined following previous studies using real time quantitative pcr deng et al 2020 the functional genes determined were amoa nxra narg napa norb nirk nirs nosz clade i and nosz clade ii 2 5 characterization of nanoplastics the nanoplastics in each reactor were sampled at phase iii and characterized under a scanning electron microscope sem tescan mira3 czech republic and confocal laser scanning microscope clsm tcs sp8 leica germany the nanoplastic samples were presented on monocrystalline silicon and dried for 24 h before sem analysis the activated sludge with the cultured nanoplastics was pretreated before observation under sem subsequently 20 ml of the activated sludge mixture was collected from each sbr and centrifuged for 10 min at 8000 rpm the supernatants were discharged and 2 5 glutaraldehyde was then added to provide immobilization for the activated sludge the immobilized sludge was stored in a 4 c refrigerator for 24 h and then centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was then discarded a phosphate buffer 0 1 m ph at 7 4 was prepared and used for washing the sludge three times different mass fraction ethanol 30 50 70 90 and 100 was then used for sludge washing to achieve sludge dewatering through gradually mixing and centrifugation the treated sludge was then freeze dried for 24 h before observation under sem the physical connection between bacteria and nanoplastics was further observed under sem using a pure bacteria experiment a pure strain of isolated denitrification bacteria pseudomonas was cultured for 12 h and nanoplastics were mixed with logarithmic growth phase bacteria to achieve an exposure nanoplastic concentration of 10 mg l and then co cultured for 12 h a pure bacteria mixture was then prepared to follow the same procedure for activated sludge as described above li et al 2019 the activated sludge collected from each sbr was also pretreated before the clsm assay the mixed activated sludge 1 ml each was washed thrice with a phosphate buffer 0 1 m the supernatant was discarded and then re suspended with did p chlorobenzene sulfonate absin shanghai china which is a specific cell membrane fluorescent dye the cell density was maintained at around 1 106 cell ml incubated at 37 c for 20 min and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was discarded and mixed with 37 c preheated phosphate buffer to re suspended the cell the sample was then ready to be observed by clsm yang et al 2020b 2 6 statistical analysis all the experiments were conducted in triplicate in this study the statistically significant difference between the sbrs with the various concentrations of nanoplastics added and the blank set was determined by one way analysis of variance anova among these the p 0 05 was considered statistically significant the statistically significant difference in the microbial community structure was analyzed using welch s t test method the metabolic pathways in each reactor were predicted using faprotax and tax4fun and analyzed using the r with package microeco liu et al 2021a the variation between the groups was analyzed using stamp parks et al 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrogen removal performance in sbrs the nitrogen removal performance by the sbrs was analyzed with various concentrations of dosed polystyrene nanoplastics the total removal of inorganic nitrogen was 81 75 4 16 83 06 4 59 83 58 5 15 and 82 43 5 63 for r1 0 μg l r2 10 μg l r3 100 μg l and r4 1000 μg l after 213 days of operation with continuous exposure of polystyrene nanoplastics respectively fig s2 the removal performance between each reactor did not demonstrate a significant difference even after long term exposure to nanoplastics in a typical cycle ammonia reduction was slightly delayed in r4 1000 μg l and nitrite accumulation was slightly increased in r3 100 μg l fig 1 the corresponding ammonia oxidation rate and nitrite accumulation were then calculated in the typical cycle the ammonia oxidation rate with the addition of nanoplastics r2 r3 r4 was significantly lower than the blank set r1 p 0 05 the ammonia oxidation rate was 21 91 0 05 mgn gmlvss h for r1 and 19 24 0 01 mgn gmlvss h for r4 the nitrate accumulation rate was 13 29 0 06 mgn gmlvss h for r1 and 11 93 0 04 mgn gmlvss h for r4 the denitrification rate was 18 23 0 26 mgn gmlvss h for r1 and 11 78 0 11 mgn gmlvss h for r4 the nitrate accumulation and denitrification rates were significantly lower in r3 and r4 as compared with r1 p 0 05 this suggests that the removal of the total inorganic nitrogen was not affected in the four sbrs with various concentrations of nanoplastics while the corresponding ammonia oxidation ability and denitrification rate in each reactor was inhibited due to nanoplastic exposure in the literature polystyrene nanoplastics suppressed the removal of tn by 29 5 40 6 in a constructed wetland it is reported that nanoplastics can penetrate the cell membrane and thus destroy the membrane integrity and ros balance accompanied with the reduction of enzyme activities and functional gene abundance yang et al 2020b meanwhile it was also reported that nanoplastics inhibit the root activity by 26 3 and 44 7 leading to a decrease in the nitrogen uptake by the plants in the wetland however whether the removal of nitrogen is attributed to plant absorption or microbiological process nitrification and denitrification has not yet been clarified nanoparticles have also been reported to be toxic to tn removal where 7 4 12 1 of the average tn removal reduction was obtained with the concentration of zno nanoparticles at 25 and 50 mg l ye et al 2020 short term 24 h exposure of silver nanoparticles at 2 and 5 mg l also demonstrated significant inhibition to the denitrification rate due to the damage to cell structure affecting the cell growth zheng et al 2018 it was also reported that nanoparticles could affect the expression of key functional genes and proteins involved in the nitrification and denitrification process and thereby the related enzyme activities this confirmed nanoplastic toxicity to the nitrification and denitrification process while its impact on the biological nitrogen removal may be varied the concentration and characteristics of nanoplastics may be a vital factor affecting the removal efficiency of biological nitrogen 3 2 n2o reduction potential in sbrs the n2o reduction rate was assayed using a micro respiration system where the n2o reduction followed a logarithmic curve for activated sludge collected from all reactors fig 2a d the slope was determined to be 134 4 117 5 226 2 and 267 5 unitless for r1 to r4 respectively this indicated that the n2o reduction rate was probably increased with the increase in nanoplastic concentration the n2o respiration rate was significantly different in each reactor fig 2e p 0 05 the n2o reduction was also fitted to an allosteric sigmoidal kinetic model where the maximum specific respiration rate was calculated fig s3 the maximal reaction velocities of n2o reduction vmax were 2 16 0 25 1 53 0 41 36 43 2 86 6 81 2 54 μmol mg mlvss l s for r1 to r4 respectively fig 2f the vmax in r3 was significantly higher than other three reactors p 0 05 this may be related to the dominant nitrification and denitrification bacteria cultured in each reactor with exposure to different doses of nanoplastics the functional gene closely correlated with n2o generation and reduction including nirs nirk nosz clade i nosz clade ii and amoa were then quantified the vmax value was positively correlated with nirs and nirs nirk abundance p 0 01 fig s4 which implied that the n2o reduction rate in each sbr with nanoplastic exposure was attributed to the nirs type bacteria meanwhile the nirs nirk noszi noszii indicates that the n2o production potential was positively correlated with nirs noszi noszii this also indicated that the nirs type denitrifier was a dominant contributor to n2o production the genera which have high relative abundance in the sbr thauera top 1 and azoarcus top 5 are nirs type denitrifiers su et al 2021 this suggests that nirs type bacteria could be more tolerant to long term exposure to nanoplastics the n2o reduction slope was negatively correlated with napa and noszi abundance p 0 05 implying that napa type bacteria were not the dominant denitrifier and that the noszi type bacteria cooperated with the napa type bacteria in the system 3 3 effects of nanoplastics on activated sludge microbes the conjunction of nanoplastics with the activated sludge in each reactor was observed under sem and clsm in this study to evaluate the effect of long time exposure of polystyrene nanoplastics to cells fig 3 the pure nanoplastics observed under sem are presented shown in fig 3a the aggregation of nanoplastics on the surface of activated sludge was observed under a concentration 1000 μg l fig 3b this phenomenon was not observed in the other reactors where the concentration of nanoplastics was not higher than 100 μg l the aggregates of activated sludge and nanoplastics from sbrs were difficult to be distinguished and observed under sem pure bacteria were used for sem observations to further observe whether nanoplastics could damage the cell membrane or enter the cell it was clear that nanoplastics were attached to the surface of the pseudomonas however no damage to the cell was observed figs 3c and d s5 the nanoplastic size was much smaller than the microorganism but larger than the phospholipid bilayer gap microorganisms can ingest the nanoplastics by active endocytosis yang et al 2020a canton and battaglia 2012 clsm was used to further check whether the nanoplastics entered the cell membrane the activated sludge from r1 to r4 with various dosages of nanoplastics was observed separately figs 3e h s6 even mixing of nanoplastics with the activated sludge was observed where the green color indicates nanoplastics and the red color indicates the cell membrane the addition of a higher concentration of nanoplastics resulted in a higher fluorescence response in the clsm field the aggregates under the clsm field were a mixture of the cell membrane nanoplastics and extracellular polymeric substances eps the nanoplastics entering into or damaging the cell membrane were not observed under the clsm which may be due to the size of the nanoplastics earlier work reported that nanoplastic exposure could cause allergic and nonallergic inflammation of cells leading to the generation of ros simon et al 2000 yang et al 2020b according to yang et al 2020b nanoplastics at concentrations of 1000 μg l could result in an accumulation of ros thereby causing lipid peroxidation of the cell membrane and damage to the cell integrity this was not observed in pure bacteria sem however the actual situation of bacteria in activated sludge could be varied the nitrogen metabolism related enzymes are located at the periplasm or phospholipid bilayer membrane damage to the membrane integrity could affect the performance of nitrogen removal in microbes han et al 2016 the internalization of nanoplastics with bacteria in activated sludge could therefore induce the overproduction of ros and cause microbial nitrogen metabolism dysfunction 3 4 microbial community changes by nanoplastics the structure of the microbial community and diversity of microorganisms were characterized in different stages during the reactor operation the raw reads of the activated sludge from all the sbrs were randomly trimmed down to 38 065 from 66 891 sequences to avoid a sampling bias the rarefaction curve and coverages value 0 999 of the sequencing results indicated that the present work demonstrated a sufficient depth of sequencing fig s7 fig s8 the alpha diversity indexes demonstrated no significant difference in each sbr table s5 the shared amplicon sequence variants asvs of the four sbrs in phase ii were 174 and 134 in phase iii r4 406 unique asvs in phase ii and 101 in phase iii demonstrated more unique asvs in phase ii while r3 77 unique asvs in phase ii and 255 in phase iii demonstrated more unique asvs in phase iii fig 4a b the microbial community in the activated sludge in each sbr in a different phase was demonstrated at the phylum fig 4c and genus level fig 4d proteobacteria and bacteroidota were the dominant phyla in all stages with or without doses of nanoplastics p 0 0001 fig 4c the relative abundance of proteobacteria and the dosage of nanoplastics was in non linear correlation in phase ii r 2 0 9840 and iii r 2 0 9989 meanwhile the relative abundance of bacteroidota and nanoplastic dosage were in exponential correlation in phase iii r 2 0 9996 this implied that the long term exposure of nanoplastics was selectively culturing the microbe community in the sbr system of this study the relative abundance of proteobacteria was found to exponentially increase with the addition of nanoplastics fig 4c the proteobacteria were determined to be the primary microbes for nitrogen removal the nitrogen removal performance of this study was therefore not affected yang et al 2020b he et al 2016 the relative abundance of proteobacteria in phase iii was 35 01 42 98 70 72 and 81 58 in r1 to r4 respectively this suggested that polystyrene nanoplastics used in this study enhanced the abundance of the nitrogen removal related bacteria proteobacteria a view of the top 20 predominant genera in each sbr of each stage fig 4d the relative abundance of the denitrification bacteria increased with the increase in nanoplastic dose swb02 cheng et al 2022 acinetobacter wang et al 2022a b defluviicoccus tayà et al 2011 azoarcus liu et al 2022 candidatus competibacter zhao et al 2019 ns9 marine group bucci et al 2021 thauera liu et al 2022 and plta13 ma et al 2022a are the denitrification bacteria which were determined to be the top 20 genera across all sbrs in this study the total relative abundance of the denitrification bacteria for phase ii was 41 49 42 10 49 51 and 68 97 from r1 to r4 respectively and 52 63 47 21 57 32 and 63 42 for phase iii from r1 to r4 respectively this indicates that nanoplastics have selectively accumulated denitrification bacteria in the sbrs thauera liu et al 2022 was found to be the predominant genera in r4 nanoplastics 1000 μg l where it increased from 7 01 phase i to 59 99 phase ii to 38 28 phase iii the predominant denitrification genera were varied in each reactor ns9 marine group 28 86 in r2 defluviicoccus 18 17 and azoarcus 21 34 in r3 and thauera 38 28 and azoarcus 15 21 in r4 among these defluviicoccus genera can reduce nitrate but cannot reduce nitrite this perfectly elucidates the high n2o reduction rate in r3 as discussed in section 3 3 fig 2f the total relative abundance of the nitrification bacteria was decreased with the increase in the concentration of nanoplastics fig 4e the nitrification related genera in the top 20 genera were found to be acinetobacter wang et al 2022a b nitrospira yuan et al 2020 olb12 li et al 2022 966 1 cao et al 2021 pseudomonas gao et al 2022 a0839 rodriguez sanchez et al 2019 nitrosomonas chang et al 2019 and chryseolinea fan et al 2021 across all sbrs the total relative abundance of the nitrification genera was determined to be 21 78 13 69 11 41 and 3 98 from r1 to r4 in phase ii and the value was decreased to 10 55 7 54 3 69 and 2 83 from r1 to r4 in phase iii respectively this indicated inhibition of the activity of nitrification bacteria due to nanoplastics as reported by earlier literature liu et al 2021b yang et al 2020b ali et al 2021 zhou et al 2022a nanoplastics can inhibit the activity of nitrifying bacteria by suppressing the activities of the nitrifying enzyme ma et al 2021 found that 10 mg l of polystyrene nanoplastics significantly suppressed the nitrifying enzymes including ammonia monooxygenase hydroxylamine dehydrogenase and nitrite oxidoreductase the functional genes related to the nitrification process including ammonia oxidation amoa in each sbr were quantified figs 4f s9 the abundance of amoa was observed to continuously decrease from phase i to phase iii consistent with the results of the nitrifier relative abundance this further verified the inhibition effect of nitrifiers due to nanoplastic exposure the nanoplastic abundance was negatively correlated with the nirk abundance p 0 05 fig s4 indicating that nanoplastics inhibited the nirk type denitrifier wu et al 2020 the significant difference in the microbial community structure was analyzed with the addition of various nanoplastics r2 to r4 and the control reactor r1 fig 5 ketobacter and pelagibius an et al 2021 was significantly higher in r1 control as compared with r2 while terrimonas denitrifier liu et al 2020 was significantly higher in r2 p 0 05 fig 5a this implied the reduction of the nitrifier and increase in denitrifier relative abundance in r2 as compared with the control ketobacter pelagibius and bradymonadales consume organic matters zhang et al 2022 genera were significantly higher in r1 as compared with r3 while steroidobacter denitrifier huang et al 2019 and sh3 11 pedosphaeraceae denitrifier hatamoto et al 2022 were significantly higher in r3 p 0 05 fig 5b the abundance of nitrifiers and organic degradation related genera was reduced and the abundance of denitrifiers were selectively improved in r3 100 μg l as compared with the control sphingosinicella organic degradation dai et al 2022 37 13 chitinophagales pseudomonas and lysobacter genera were significantly higher in r1 as compared with r4 while mlel 8 denitrifier zhou et al 2022b was significantly higher in r4 p 0 05 fig 5c at the phylum level latescibacterota planctomycetota and proteobacteria were significantly lower in r1 control while acidobacteriota was significantly higher in r1 as compared with r4 p 0 05 fig 5d this implied that with the addition of nanoplastics and with its operation for around 200 days the microbial community in the sbrs demonstrated a significant difference as compared with the control reactor in general there was a significant increase in the relative abundance of the denitrifier and a significant decrease in the organic matter degradation genera and nitrifier abundance this also indicated the selectivity of nanoplastics to the microbes in the biological nitrogen removal process faprotax and tax4fun were used to predict the metabolic processes of the microorganisms fig 6 the results implied that although aerobic chemoheterotrophy was dominant in all reactors only r4 demonstrated a significant difference in metabolic function as compared with the control set r1 fig 6a nitrogen and nitrate respiration were significantly increased in r4 as compared with the control r1 p 0 05 fig 6c this was consistent with the increase in the abundance of the denitrification related genera as discussed above lipid metabolism was significantly reduced p 0 05 in r4 as compared with the control r1 indicating that the lipid metabolism function was inhibited with the high concentration of nanoplastics added in wastewater treatment fig 6b d earlier literature also reported the inhibition of lipid metabolism enzymes by exposure to nanoplastics li et al 2021 the high concentration of nanoplastics could also destroy the cell membrane and resulted in a suppression of the lipid metabolism function yang et al 2020b meanwhile the membrane transport function demonstrated a higher percentage in r4 15 94 0 77 as compared with other reactors significantly higher than r2 p 0 05 this implied that nanoplastics selectively enhanced the membrane transport function of the microbes in sbrs the cooperative and competitive interactions among all the microbes at the genus level were illustrated by the co occurrence network fig 7 table s6 there were 535 edges and 194 nodes including 1059 positive correlations and 11 negative correlations this implied a strong positive correlation between the genera in the sbrs seven main modules were closely correlated occupying 11 34 11 34 8 25 8 25 4 64 5 15 and 4 64 respectively the bacteria and their primary function in a dominant module comprising bacteria belonging to the top 20 genera of relative abundance were checked and listed fig 7 table s7 for example the nitrification bacteria nitriliruptoraceae denitrification bacteria methylophaga and organic removal bacteria at s16 gammaproteobacteria were positively correlated showing intimate cooperation and small world properties bla et al 2019 chen et al 2021 obscuribacteraceae cyanobacteria phyla demonstrated a competitive correlation between plasticicumulans able to use various organic carbon sources comamonas denitrifier dechloromonas denitrifier and chryseolinea nitrifier cai et al 2020 bai et al 2022 a predominant module green color in fig 7 comprising nitrification bacteria denitrification genera phosphorus metabolism plastic degradation aeromicrobium organics removal and other common functions of the wastewater treatment process was positively correlated showing close cooperation wang et al 2022a b 4 implications of this work nanoplastic contamination has caused increasing concern followed by the high attention to microplastic contamination study although the toxicity impact of engineered nanoparticles on the wastewater treatment process has been studied over the last decade brar et al 2010 choi and hu 2009 the effect and microbial mechanism of nanoplastics on the removal of biological nutrients from wastewater have rarely been reported nanoplastics have been reported as being neither engineered nanoparticles nor microplastics its effect on the wastewater treatment process could therefore be varied according to both gigault et al 2021 the impact of nanoplastics on microbial processes could result from both their size and their physical and chemical characteristics earlier literature has highlighted the possibility of the high amount of nanoplastics entering wastewater treatment plants its effect on the biological nutrient removal and microbial community structure therefore is of concern this study to the best of our knowledge revealed for the first time the impact and microbial mechanism of the long term exposure of nanoplastics on the wastewater treatment process the results indicated that with over 200 days of exposure the total nitrogen removal was not affected by the input of the highest concentration of nanoplastics at 1000 μg l where the nanoplastics concentration could be accumulated in the system a have a higher actual value however the microbial community was largely changed and the microbial function was also significantly varied this implied a strong selectivity of the nanoplastics especially when it was exposed at high concentrations such as 1000 μg l the impact on the microbial community after a five or 10 year exposure to nanoplastics in addition to the corresponding total nitrogen removal performance is still unclear with increasing nanoplastics entering sewers due to human activities the stress on the wastewater treatment plants should be of concern at the same time the material and size of the nanoplastics could vary in the actual system the impact of the long term exposure to the biological nitrogen removal process is of concern the existence of other organic pollutants biopolymers and their effect on the stability and actual concentration of nanoplastics could additionally affect the treatment process the adsorption absorption suspension agglomeration and settling of the nanoplastics with the particles in the actual system during biological nitrogen removal are worth further investigation this study highlights the effects of nanoplastics in the wastewater treatment process providing critical information for the management of urban wastewater treatment plants 5 conclusion this study investigated the effect and microbial mechanism of nanoplastics on the biological nitrogen removal in the wastewater treatment process the exposure to polystyrene nanoplastics for over 200 days at concentrations of 0 to 1000 μg l did not demonstrate a significant impact on the total nitrogen removal meanwhile the ammonia oxidation rate and nitrate reduction rate were significantly inhibited with high concentrations of nanoplastics 100 and 1000 μg l the n2o respiration rate was logarithmically correlated with time where a higher rate occurred with the higher abundance of nanoplastics the maximal reaction velocities of n2o vmax demonstrated the highest value in r3 due to the predominance of defluviicoccus genera in r3 the predominant genera varied in each sbr with the different concentrations of nanoplastics exposure the relative abundance of the nitrification genera decreased with the increase in the concentration of nanoplastics while the denitrification genera percentage was largely increased with the improvement in nanoplastics concentration the lipid metabolism function was significantly suppressed and membrane transport function was significantly enhanced with nanoplastics at 1000 μg l as compared with the control set indicating selective culturing of nanoplastics to microorganisms during wastewater treatment the continuous exposure of polystyrene nanoplastics demonstrated no impact on the total removal of nitrogen however this indicated a strong selectivity of the microbes in the system the long term impact of nanoplastics on the selective culturing of microbes in wastewater treatment systems should therefore be taken into consideration declaration of competing interest

15600,contamination by nanoplastics in urban water has aroused increasing concern the impact of nanoplastic exposure on the wastewater treatment process in the long term is still unclear this study investigated the effect of continuous nanoplastic exposure r1 0 r2 10 r3 100 and r4 1000 μg l on the nitrification and denitrification processes for over 200 days in a sequencing batch reactor sbr the results revealed that nanoplastic exposure does not demonstrate significant inhibition of total nitrogen removal the ammonia oxidation rate 19 24 0 01 mgn gmlvss h p 0 05 and denitrification rate 11 78 0 11 mgn gmlvss h p 0 05 in r4 was significantly lower than the control r1 0 μg l the maximal reaction velocities of n2o reduction vmax were improved after long term exposure to nanoplastics in high concentrations the r3 demonstrated the highest vmax value six times higher than r4 and approximately 20 times higher than r1 and r2 the microbial structure largely varied with the exposure to nanoplastics where the exposure to a high concentration largely suppressed the nitrifier and selectively enriched the denitrifier the percentage of the top 20 genera of denitrifiers increased from 31 76 to 63 42 and the nitrifiers decreased from an initial 12 40 to 2 83 for r4 the predominant genera were found to be thauera azoarcus and defluviicoccus in r4 and r3 which indicated their tolerance to nanoplastics the function prediction results indicated that the membrane transport function was significantly enhanced and the lipid metabolism function was significantly reduced in r4 as compared with the control r1 p 0 05 this may be attributed to the adsorption of nanoplastics on bacteria observation under a scan electronic microscope demonstrated that the nanoplastics were firmly attached to the microbe surface and aggregated in activated sludge at high nanoplastics dosed reactor these results deepen the understanding of the effect of nanoplastics on the urban wastewater treatment process and provide valuable information for the management of nanoplastic contamination in urban wastewater keywords nanoplastics urban wastewater nitrification denitrification nitrous oxide microbial mechanism data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the contamination of urban water by nanoplastics has aroused worldwide attention kumar et al 2021 mitrano et al 2019 most of the studies have focused on contamination in the aquatic ecosystem shen et al 2019 koelmans et al 2015 cai et al 2021 whereas its occurrence and effect on urban wastewater treatment plants wwtps have rarely been reported studies on nanoplastics are limited due to the controversy regarding their definition and their accurate detection sobhani et al 2020 mohana et al 2021 delgado gallardo et al 2021 the most widely accepted definition of nanoplastics is that they are plastics with sizes of 1 1000 nm junaid and wang 2021 mitrano et al 2021 hartmann et al 2019 wwtps are an important source of nanoplastics where the microplastics are broken into nanoplastics enfrin et al 2019 it is also an important sink considering domestic sewage brings a large number of nanoplastics into wwtps such as those released from personal care products ppcps enfrin et al 2020 ali et al 2021 hernandez et al 2017 the fate of nanoplastics in wwtps is complicated including but not limited to 1 them being newly produced from microplastics through weathering processes such as breaking hydrolysis degradation oxidation and so forth mohana et al 2021 kim et al 2020 2 participating in the nitrification and denitrification process with activated sludge besseling et al 2019 reported that the concentration of nanoplastics could be 1014 times higher than the concentration of microplastics the role of nanoplastics in the wastewater nitrogen cycling process is not clear yet studies focusing on the effect of nanoplastics on the wastewater nitrification and denitrification process is limited earlier literature has investigated the effect of nanoplastics on nitrogen removal in a constructed wetland system it was reported that polystyrene nanoplastics with concentrations of 1 and 10 mg l have an insignificant effect on cod removal but significantly inhibit total nitrogen tn removal 7 15 the high abundance of polystyrene nanoplastics could probably produce reactive oxygen species ros and lead to oxidative stress in the system as implied by the researchers xu and tsang 2022 the major functional bacteria related to nitrogen cycling in the system were also negatively affected by polystyrene nanoplastics ma et al 2022b another study that investigated the concentrations of polystyrene nanoplastics at 0 10 and 1000 μg l also reported a decrease in tn removal 29 5 40 6 accompanied by a decrease in the relative abundance of nitrifiers and denitrifiers yang et al 2020b recent studies have compared the effect of microplastics and nanoplastics on nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment where it was only hindered by nanoplastics due to their characteristics the removal of nh4 n was decreased by 24 48 at nanoplastic concentrations of 1000 μg l zhou et al 2022a yang et al 2022 compared the exposure of nanoplastics to wetland systems of different sizes and concentrations where the ammonia removal was decreased by 7 6 71 2 it may be concluded that the long term exposure to nanoplastics decreased the microbial richness and diversity the ros oxidation stress is the most widely accepted explanation for nanoparticle toxicity mechanism and engineered nanoparticles wang and chen 2016 ma et al 2021 revealed the negative impact and toxic mechanism of nanoplastics on nitrogen cycling in wetlands by metagenomic and enzyme activity analysis it was revealed that high concentrations of nanoplastics significantly suppressed nitrifying enzyme activities the overproduction of ros and antioxidant system variation in macrophytes and microbes are the primary reasons for the toxic mechanism of nanoplastics the toxic impact of nanoplastics and microbial mechanisms on nitrogen removal in domestic wastewater treatment is therefore unclear nitrous oxide n2o is a potent greenhouse gas ghg and also an important intermediate in the nitrogen cycling process ni et al 2013 desloover et al 2012 wwtps are an important hotspot for n2o emission considering n2o is an obligatory byproduct of the heterotrophic denitrification and autotrophic nitrification process foley et al 2010 law et al 2012 although the effect of nanoplastics on n2o emission has rarely been reported the engineered nanoparticles inhibition to n2o emission has been widely studied it was reported that the nitrification process is susceptible to silver nanoparticles and that the denitrification process is related to the size of nanoparticles mcgee 2020 zheng et al 2017 found that the effect of silver nanoparticles on nitrifier n2o production was that of low dose stimulation and high dose inhibition the production of n2o could even be enhanced by over 100 when compared with a control it was suggested that the nitric oxide reductase gene expression was up regulated with the treatment of low dose silver nanoparticles the dose of silver nanoparticles to the nitrification activity and the molecular underpinning was additionally highlighted ye et al 2020 suggested that zno nanoparticles have stronger inhibition of the denitrification process than the nitrification process where the removal of tn and n2o emissions were reduced since the characteristics of nanoplastics are distinguished from engineered nanoparticles due to the high particle heterogeneity composition and morphologies they should be distinct from nanoparticles gigault et al 2021 the effect of nanoplastics on nitrogen cycling and n2o emission in wastewater treatment should therefore be studied this study aims to investigate the effect of long term exposure to nanoplastics on the nitrification and denitrification processes in wastewater treatment the sequencing batch reactor sbr with different doses of nanoplastics in the influent was operated continuously where the nh4 n removal no3 n production and tn removal were detected the n2o reduction rate and the kinetic and production potential under various influent dosages of nanoplastics were analyzed the changes in the microbial community and functional gene abundance variation in each system were also analyzed and compared the results of this study could potentially deepen the understanding of the effect and microbial mechanism of nanoplastics on the nitrogen removal process during wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 setup and operation of the reactors this study used four lab scale sbrs with

nahco3 solution the dissolved oxygen do was maintained above 2 0 mg l during the aeration process and below 0 5 mg l during the anaerobic stage by the do controller the feed water used was simulated wastewater with chemical oxygen demand cod of approximately 450 mg l and nh4 n at 50 mg l the detailed composition of the feed water is listed in table s1 and table s2 besides this separated feed water with different concentrations of nanoplastics 0 10 100 1000 μg l was prepared for each reactor the polystyrene nanoplastics 100 nm 5 w v used were purchased from sigma aldrich shanghai china the polystyrene suspension was diluted progressively to 100 times the designed concentration with milliq water and then diluted to the designed concentration with the simulated wastewater before use the reactors were stably operated for over 200 days during this study 2 2 water quality analysis and denitrification rate assay the nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations in the influent and effluent of the four parallel reactors were analyzed twice a day the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n c were analyzed using spectrophotometric methods the variations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations during a typical cycle in each reactor were measured per month the denitrification rate of the reactors with various nanoplastics added was detected after 120 days of operation and conducted once per two weeks the denitrification rate assay was conducted in a 0 2 l working volume system the feed water used in this assay had an initial no3 n at 100 mg l and cod at 400 mg l table s3 the mixed sludge of volume 0 2 l was collected from each reactor centrifuged at 3000 rpm to remove the supernatant washed with milliq water and centrifuged at 3000 rpm this process was repeated thrice to reduce the interference of experimental error the washed activated sludge from each reactor was mixed with the feed water and then swept with pure n2 99 99 for two minutes to maintain anaerobic condition the systems were then sealed and mixed using a magnetic stirrer this assay was conducted for 120 min and the water sample was collected for 20 min the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n no3 n mlss and mlvss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids were measured after the experiment the mlss and mlvss were measured following standard methods apha et al 2012 the specific denitrification rate was calculated as the ratio of the no3 n reduction rate to the concentration of mlvss unit mg no3 n g mlvss h 2 3 n2o respiration experiment the n2o consumption kinetics of the activated sludge from each sbr with various doses of nanoplastic culture was estimated using a lab scale microrespiration system unisense denmark this system was equipped with a clark type n2o microsensor a microchamber with a volume of 6 ml and a magnetic stirrer installed in the sensor stand online monitoring of dissolved n2o concentration was available with a laptop connected fig s1 a volume of 15 ml of mixed activated sludge from

table s4 the synthetic water was swept with pure n2 99 99 purity xiangyun industry wuhan china before being filled into the microchamber sodium acetate was used as a carbon source where the excess concentration was prepared as synthetic water to control the n2o as the sole limiting substrate the stoichiometric relation between n2o and sodium acetate was assessed using eqs 1 and 2 zhou et al 2021 approximately 20 μl of concentrated n2o solution 25 mmol l was injected into the chamber the n2o solution was then spiked to adjust the initial n2o concentration at 800 μmol l a glass coated stirrer bar was stirred at 400 rpm to provide mixing during the experiments the n2o concentration was recorded for the mixture sludge from each sbr respectively 1 4 n 2 o c h 3 co o 4 n 2 c o 2 hc o 3

i and nosz clade ii 2 5 characterization of nanoplastics the nanoplastics in each reactor were sampled at phase iii and characterized under a scanning electron microscope sem tescan mira3 czech republic and confocal laser scanning microscope clsm tcs sp8 leica germany the nanoplastic samples were presented on monocrystalline silicon and dried for 24 h before sem analysis the activated sludge with the cultured nanoplastics was pretreated before observation under sem subsequently 20 ml of the activated sludge mixture was collected from each sbr and centrifuged for 10 min at 8000 rpm the supernatants were discharged and 2 5 glutaraldehyde was then added to provide immobilization for the activated sludge the immobilized sludge was stored in a 4 c refrigerator for 24 h and then centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was then discarded a phosphate buffer 0 1 m ph at 7 4 was prepared and used for washing the sludge three times different mass fraction ethanol 30 50 70 90 and 100 was then used for sludge washing to achieve sludge dewatering through gradually mixing and centrifugation the treated sludge was then freeze dried for 24 h before observation under sem the physical connection between bacteria and nanoplastics was further observed under sem using a pure bacteria experiment a pure strain of isolated denitrification bacteria pseudomonas was cultured for 12 h and nanoplastics were mixed with logarithmic growth phase bacteria to achieve an exposure nanoplastic concentration of 10 mg l and then co cultured for 12 h a pure bacteria mixture was then prepared to follow the same procedure for activated sludge as described above li et al 2019 the activated sludge collected from each sbr was also pretreated before the clsm assay the mixed activated sludge 1 ml each was washed thrice with a phosphate buffer 0 1 m the supernatant was discarded and then re suspended with did p chlorobenzene sulfonate absin shanghai china which is a specific cell membrane fluorescent dye the cell density was maintained at around 1 106 cell ml incubated at 37 c for 20 min and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was discarded and mixed with 37 c preheated phosphate buffer to re suspended the cell the sample was then ready to be observed by clsm yang et al 2020b 2 6 statistical analysis all the experiments were conducted in triplicate in this study the statistically significant difference between the sbrs with the various concentrations of nanoplastics added and the blank set was determined by one way analysis of variance anova among these the p 0 05 was considered statistically significant the statistically significant difference in the microbial community structure was analyzed using welch s t test method the metabolic pathways in each reactor were predicted using faprotax and tax4fun and analyzed using the r with package microeco liu et al 2021a the variation between the groups was analyzed using stamp parks et al 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrogen removal performance in sbrs the nitrogen removal performance by the sbrs was analyzed with various concentrations of dosed polystyrene nanoplastics the total removal of inorganic nitrogen was 81 75 4 16 83 06 4 59 83 58 5 15 and 82 43 5 63 for r1 0 μg l r2 10 μg l r3 100 μg l and r4 1000 μg l after 213 days of operation with continuous exposure of polystyrene nanoplastics respectively fig s2 the removal performance between each reactor did not demonstrate a significant difference even after long term exposure to nanoplastics in a typical cycle ammonia reduction was slightly delayed in r4 1000 μg l and nitrite accumulation was slightly increased in r3 100 μg l fig 1 the corresponding ammonia oxidation rate and nitrite accumulation were then calculated in the typical cycle the ammonia oxidation rate with the addition of nanoplastics r2 r3 r4 was significantly lower than the blank set r1 p 0 05 the ammonia oxidation rate was 21 91 0 05 mgn gmlvss h for r1 and 19 24 0 01 mgn gmlvss h for r4 the nitrate accumulation rate was 13 29 0 06 mgn gmlvss h for r1 and 11 93 0 04 mgn gmlvss h for r4 the denitrification rate was 18 23 0 26 mgn gmlvss h for r1 and 11 78 0 11 mgn gmlvss h for r4 the nitrate accumulation and denitrification rates were significantly lower in r3 and r4 as compared with r1 p 0 05 this suggests that the removal of the total inorganic nitrogen was not affected in the four sbrs with various concentrations of nanoplastics while the corresponding ammonia oxidation ability and denitrification rate in each reactor was inhibited due to nanoplastic exposure in the literature polystyrene nanoplastics suppressed the removal of tn by 29 5 40 6 in a constructed wetland it is reported that nanoplastics can penetrate the cell membrane and thus destroy the membrane integrity and ros balance accompanied with the reduction of enzyme activities and functional gene abundance yang et al 2020b meanwhile it was also reported that nanoplastics inhibit the root activity by 26 3 and 44 7 leading to a decrease in the nitrogen uptake by the plants in the wetland however whether the removal of nitrogen is attributed to plant absorption or microbiological process nitrification and denitrification has not yet been clarified nanoparticles have also been reported to be toxic to tn removal where 7 4 12 1 of the average tn removal reduction was obtained with the concentration of zno nanoparticles at 25 and 50 mg l ye et al 2020 short term 24 h exposure of silver nanoparticles at 2 and 5 mg l also demonstrated significant inhibition to the denitrification rate due to the damage to cell structure affecting the cell growth zheng et al 2018 it was also reported that nanoparticles could affect the expression of key functional genes and proteins involved in the nitrification and denitrification process and thereby the related enzyme activities this confirmed nanoplastic toxicity to the nitrification and denitrification process while its impact on the biological nitrogen removal may be varied the concentration and characteristics of nanoplastics may be a vital factor affecting the removal efficiency of biological nitrogen 3 2 n2o reduction potential in sbrs the n2o reduction rate was assayed using a micro respiration system where the n2o reduction followed a logarithmic curve for activated sludge collected from all reactors fig 2a d the slope was determined to be 134 4 117 5 226 2 and 267 5 unitless for r1 to r4 respectively this indicated that the n2o reduction rate was probably increased with the increase in nanoplastic concentration the n2o respiration rate was significantly different in each reactor fig 2e p 0 05 the n2o reduction was also fitted to an allosteric sigmoidal kinetic model where the maximum specific respiration rate was calculated fig s3 the maximal reaction velocities of n2o reduction vmax were 2 16 0 25 1 53 0 41 36 43 2 86 6 81 2 54 μmol mg mlvss l s for r1 to r4 respectively fig 2f the vmax in r3 was significantly higher than other three reactors p 0 05 this may be related to the dominant nitrification and denitrification bacteria cultured in each reactor with exposure to different doses of nanoplastics the functional gene closely correlated with n2o generation and reduction including nirs nirk nosz clade i nosz clade ii and amoa were then quantified the vmax value was positively correlated with nirs and nirs nirk abundance p 0 01 fig s4 which implied that the n2o reduction rate in each sbr with nanoplastic exposure was attributed to the nirs type bacteria meanwhile the nirs nirk noszi noszii indicates that the n2o production potential was positively correlated with nirs noszi noszii this also indicated that the nirs type denitrifier was a dominant contributor to n2o production the genera which have high relative abundance in the sbr thauera top 1 and azoarcus top 5 are nirs type denitrifiers su et al 2021 this suggests that nirs type bacteria could be more tolerant to long term exposure to nanoplastics the n2o reduction slope was negatively correlated with napa and noszi abundance p 0 05 implying that napa type bacteria were not the dominant denitrifier and that the noszi type bacteria cooperated with the napa type bacteria in the system 3 3 effects of nanoplastics on activated sludge microbes the conjunction of nanoplastics with the activated sludge in each reactor was observed under sem and clsm in this study to evaluate the effect of long time exposure of polystyrene nanoplastics to cells fig 3 the pure nanoplastics observed under sem are presented shown in fig 3a the aggregation of nanoplastics on the surface of activated sludge was observed under a concentration 1000 μg l fig 3b this phenomenon was not observed in the other reactors where the concentration of nanoplastics was not higher than 100 μg l the aggregates of activated sludge and nanoplastics from sbrs were difficult to be distinguished and observed under sem pure bacteria were used for sem observations to further observe whether nanoplastics could damage the cell membrane or enter the cell it was clear that nanoplastics were attached to the surface of the pseudomonas however no damage to the cell was observed figs 3c and d s5 the nanoplastic size was much smaller than the microorganism but larger than the phospholipid bilayer gap microorganisms can ingest the nanoplastics by active endocytosis yang et al 2020a canton and battaglia 2012 clsm was used to further check whether the nanoplastics entered the cell membrane the activated sludge from r1 to r4 with various dosages of nanoplastics was observed separately figs 3e h s6 even mixing of nanoplastics with the activated sludge was observed where the green color indicates nanoplastics and the red color indicates the cell membrane the addition of a higher concentration of nanoplastics resulted in a higher fluorescence response in the clsm field the aggregates under the clsm field were a mixture of the cell membrane nanoplastics and extracellular polymeric substances eps the nanoplastics entering into or damaging the cell membrane were not observed under the clsm which may be due to the size of the nanoplastics earlier work reported that nanoplastic exposure could cause allergic and nonallergic inflammation of cells leading to the generation of ros simon et al 2000 yang et al 2020b according to yang et al 2020b nanoplastics at concentrations of 1000 μg l could result in an accumulation of ros thereby causing lipid peroxidation of the cell membrane and damage to the cell integrity this was not observed in pure bacteria sem however the actual situation of bacteria in activated sludge could be varied the nitrogen metabolism related enzymes are located at the periplasm or phospholipid bilayer membrane damage to the membrane integrity could affect the performance of nitrogen removal in microbes han et al 2016 the internalization of nanoplastics with bacteria in activated sludge could therefore induce the overproduction of ros and cause microbial nitrogen metabolism dysfunction 3 4 microbial community changes by nanoplastics the structure of the microbial community and diversity of microorganisms were characterized in different stages during the reactor operation the raw reads of the activated sludge from all the sbrs were randomly trimmed down to 38 065 from 66 891 sequences to avoid a sampling bias the rarefaction curve and coverages value 0 999 of the sequencing results indicated that the present work demonstrated a sufficient depth of sequencing fig s7 fig s8 the alpha diversity indexes demonstrated no significant difference in each sbr table s5 the shared amplicon sequence variants asvs of the four sbrs in phase ii were 174 and 134 in phase iii r4 406 unique asvs in phase ii and 101 in phase iii demonstrated more unique asvs in phase ii while r3 77 unique asvs in phase ii and 255 in phase iii demonstrated more unique asvs in phase iii fig 4a b the microbial community in the activated sludge in each sbr in a different phase was demonstrated at the phylum fig 4c and genus level fig 4d proteobacteria and bacteroidota were the dominant phyla in all stages with or without doses of nanoplastics p 0 0001 fig 4c the relative abundance of proteobacteria and the dosage of nanoplastics was in non linear correlation in phase ii r 2 0 9840 and iii r 2 0 9989 meanwhile the relative abundance of bacteroidota and nanoplastic dosage were in exponential correlation in phase iii r 2 0 9996 this implied that the long term exposure of nanoplastics was selectively culturing the microbe community in the sbr system of this study the relative abundance of proteobacteria was found to exponentially increase with the addition of nanoplastics fig 4c the proteobacteria were determined to be the primary microbes for nitrogen removal the nitrogen removal performance of this study was therefore not affected yang et al 2020b he et al 2016 the relative abundance of proteobacteria in phase iii was 35 01 42 98 70 72 and 81 58 in r1 to r4 respectively this suggested that polystyrene nanoplastics used in this study enhanced the abundance of the nitrogen removal related bacteria proteobacteria a view of the top 20 predominant genera in each sbr of each stage fig 4d the relative abundance of the denitrification bacteria increased with the increase in nanoplastic dose swb02 cheng et al 2022 acinetobacter wang et al 2022a b defluviicoccus tayà et al 2011 azoarcus liu et al 2022 candidatus competibacter zhao et al 2019 ns9 marine group bucci et al 2021 thauera liu et al 2022 and plta13 ma et al 2022a are the denitrification bacteria which were determined to be the top 20 genera across all sbrs in this study the total relative abundance of the denitrification bacteria for phase ii was 41 49 42 10 49 51 and 68 97 from r1 to r4 respectively and 52 63 47 21 57 32 and 63 42 for phase iii from r1 to r4 respectively this indicates that nanoplastics have selectively accumulated denitrification bacteria in the sbrs thauera liu et al 2022 was found to be the predominant genera in r4 nanoplastics 1000 μg l where it increased from 7 01 phase i to 59 99 phase ii to 38 28 phase iii the predominant denitrification genera were varied in each reactor ns9 marine group 28 86 in r2 defluviicoccus 18 17 and azoarcus 21 34 in r3 and thauera 38 28 and azoarcus 15 21 in r4 among these defluviicoccus genera can reduce nitrate but cannot reduce nitrite this perfectly elucidates the high n2o reduction rate in r3 as discussed in section 3 3 fig 2f the total relative abundance of the nitrification bacteria was decreased with the increase in the concentration of nanoplastics fig 4e the nitrification related genera in the top 20 genera were found to be acinetobacter wang et al 2022a b nitrospira yuan et al 2020 olb12 li et al 2022 966 1 cao et al 2021 pseudomonas gao et al 2022 a0839 rodriguez sanchez et al 2019 nitrosomonas chang et al 2019 and chryseolinea fan et al 2021 across all sbrs the total relative abundance of the nitrification genera was determined to be 21 78 13 69 11 41 and 3 98 from r1 to r4 in phase ii and the value was decreased to 10 55 7 54 3 69 and 2 83 from r1 to r4 in phase iii respectively this indicated inhibition of the activity of nitrification bacteria due to nanoplastics as reported by earlier literature liu et al 2021b yang et al 2020b ali et al 2021 zhou et al 2022a nanoplastics can inhibit the activity of nitrifying bacteria by suppressing the activities of the nitrifying enzyme ma et al 2021 found that 10 mg l of polystyrene nanoplastics significantly suppressed the nitrifying enzymes including ammonia monooxygenase hydroxylamine dehydrogenase and nitrite oxidoreductase the functional genes related to the nitrification process including ammonia oxidation amoa in each sbr were quantified figs 4f s9 the abundance of amoa was observed to continuously decrease from phase i to phase iii consistent with the results of the nitrifier relative abundance this further verified the inhibition effect of nitrifiers due to nanoplastic exposure the nanoplastic abundance was negatively correlated with the nirk abundance p 0 05 fig s4 indicating that nanoplastics inhibited the nirk type denitrifier wu et al 2020 the significant difference in the microbial community structure was analyzed with the addition of various nanoplastics r2 to r4 and the control reactor r1 fig 5 ketobacter and pelagibius an et al 2021 was significantly higher in r1 control as compared with r2 while terrimonas denitrifier liu et al 2020 was significantly higher in r2 p 0 05 fig 5a this implied the reduction of the nitrifier and increase in denitrifier relative abundance in r2 as compared with the control ketobacter pelagibius and bradymonadales consume organic matters zhang et al 2022 genera were significantly higher in r1 as compared with r3 while steroidobacter denitrifier huang et al 2019 and sh3 11 pedosphaeraceae denitrifier hatamoto et al 2022 were significantly higher in r3 p 0 05 fig 5b the abundance of nitrifiers and organic degradation related genera was reduced and the abundance of denitrifiers were selectively improved in r3 100 μg l as compared with the control sphingosinicella organic degradation dai et al 2022 37 13 chitinophagales pseudomonas and lysobacter genera were significantly higher in r1 as compared with r4 while mlel 8 denitrifier zhou et al 2022b was significantly higher in r4 p 0 05 fig 5c at the phylum level latescibacterota planctomycetota and proteobacteria were significantly lower in r1 control while acidobacteriota was significantly higher in r1 as compared with r4 p 0 05 fig 5d this implied that with the addition of nanoplastics and with its operation for around 200 days the microbial community in the sbrs demonstrated a significant difference as compared with the control reactor in general there was a significant increase in the relative abundance of the denitrifier and a significant decrease in the organic matter degradation genera and nitrifier abundance this also indicated the selectivity of nanoplastics to the microbes in the biological nitrogen removal process faprotax and tax4fun were used to predict the metabolic processes of the microorganisms fig 6 the results implied that although aerobic chemoheterotrophy was dominant in all reactors only r4 demonstrated a significant difference in metabolic function as compared with the control set r1 fig 6a nitrogen and nitrate respiration were significantly increased in r4 as compared with the control r1 p 0 05 fig 6c this was consistent with the increase in the abundance of the denitrification related genera as discussed above lipid metabolism was significantly reduced p 0 05 in r4 as compared with the control r1 indicating that the lipid metabolism function was inhibited with the high concentration of nanoplastics added in wastewater treatment fig 6b d earlier literature also reported the inhibition of lipid metabolism enzymes by exposure to nanoplastics li et al 2021 the high concentration of nanoplastics could also destroy the cell membrane and resulted in a suppression of the lipid metabolism function yang et al 2020b meanwhile the membrane transport function demonstrated a higher percentage in r4 15 94 0 77 as compared with other reactors significantly higher than r2 p 0 05 this implied that nanoplastics selectively enhanced the membrane transport function of the microbes in sbrs the cooperative and competitive interactions among all the microbes at the genus level were illustrated by the co occurrence network fig 7 table s6 there were 535 edges and 194 nodes including 1059 positive correlations and 11 negative correlations this implied a strong positive correlation between the genera in the sbrs seven main modules were closely correlated occupying 11 34 11 34 8 25 8 25 4 64 5 15 and 4 64 respectively the bacteria and their primary function in a dominant module comprising bacteria belonging to the top 20 genera of relative abundance were checked and listed fig 7 table s7 for example the nitrification bacteria nitriliruptoraceae denitrification bacteria methylophaga and organic removal bacteria at s16 gammaproteobacteria were positively correlated showing intimate cooperation and small world properties bla et al 2019 chen et al 2021 obscuribacteraceae cyanobacteria phyla demonstrated a competitive correlation between plasticicumulans able to use various organic carbon sources comamonas denitrifier dechloromonas denitrifier and chryseolinea nitrifier cai et al 2020 bai et al 2022 a predominant module green color in fig 7 comprising nitrification bacteria denitrification genera phosphorus metabolism plastic degradation aeromicrobium organics removal and other common functions of the wastewater treatment process was positively correlated showing close cooperation wang et al 2022a b 4 implications of this work nanoplastic contamination has caused increasing concern followed by the high attention to microplastic contamination study although the toxicity impact of engineered nanoparticles on the wastewater treatment process has been studied over the last decade brar et al 2010 choi and hu 2009 the effect and microbial mechanism of nanoplastics on the removal of biological nutrients from wastewater have rarely been reported nanoplastics have been reported as being neither engineered nanoparticles nor microplastics its effect on the wastewater treatment process could therefore be varied according to both gigault et al 2021 the impact of nanoplastics on microbial processes could result from both their size and their physical and chemical characteristics earlier literature has highlighted the possibility of the high amount of nanoplastics entering wastewater treatment plants its effect on the biological nutrient removal and microbial community structure therefore is of concern this study to the best of our knowledge revealed for the first time the impact and microbial mechanism of the long term exposure of nanoplastics on the wastewater treatment process the results indicated that with over 200 days of exposure the total nitrogen removal was not affected by the input of the highest concentration of nanoplastics at 1000 μg l where the nanoplastics concentration could be accumulated in the system a have a higher actual value however the microbial community was largely changed and the microbial function was also significantly varied this implied a strong selectivity of the nanoplastics especially when it was exposed at high concentrations such as 1000 μg l the impact on the microbial community after a five or 10 year exposure to nanoplastics in addition to the corresponding total nitrogen removal performance is still unclear with increasing nanoplastics entering sewers due to human activities the stress on the wastewater treatment plants should be of concern at the same time the material and size of the nanoplastics could vary in the actual system the impact of the long term exposure to the biological nitrogen removal process is of concern the existence of other organic pollutants biopolymers and their effect on the stability and actual concentration of nanoplastics could additionally affect the treatment process the adsorption absorption suspension agglomeration and settling of the nanoplastics with the particles in the actual system during biological nitrogen removal are worth further investigation this study highlights the effects of nanoplastics in the wastewater treatment process providing critical information for the management of urban wastewater treatment plants 5 conclusion this study investigated the effect and microbial mechanism of nanoplastics on the biological nitrogen removal in the wastewater treatment process the exposure to polystyrene nanoplastics for over 200 days at concentrations of 0 to 1000 μg l did not demonstrate a significant impact on the total nitrogen removal meanwhile the ammonia oxidation rate and nitrate reduction rate were significantly inhibited with high concentrations of nanoplastics 100 and 1000 μg l the n2o respiration rate was logarithmically correlated with time where a higher rate occurred with the higher abundance of nanoplastics the maximal reaction velocities of n2o vmax demonstrated the highest value in r3 due to the predominance of defluviicoccus genera in r3 the predominant genera varied in each sbr with the different concentrations of nanoplastics exposure the relative abundance of the nitrification genera decreased with the increase in the concentration of nanoplastics while the denitrification genera percentage was largely increased with the improvement in nanoplastics concentration the lipid metabolism function was significantly suppressed and membrane transport function was significantly enhanced with nanoplastics at 1000 μg l as compared with the control set indicating selective culturing of nanoplastics to microorganisms during wastewater treatment the continuous exposure of polystyrene nanoplastics demonstrated no impact on the total removal of nitrogen however this indicated a strong selectivity of the microbes in the system the long term impact of nanoplastics on the selective culturing of microbes in wastewater treatment systems should therefore be taken into consideration declaration of competing interest

15601,microplastics mps are emerging as anthropogenic vectors for the colonization and transportation of microbial communities in aquatic ecosystems however the composition of the microbiome and its environmental risk on field mps at watershed scale has rarely been explored here geographical distributions of microbiome antibiotic resistance genes args and virulence factors vfs on field mps at watershed scale were characterized and their potential environmental risks were evaluated based on the data from metagenomic analyzes the succession of microbial communities on mps was observed along the watershed and some args and vfs were significantly enriched on mps in urban region in comparison with rural region potential environmental risk of mps conducted by projection pursuit regression model in midstream peri urban region and downstream urban region were significantly higher than that in upstream rural region and exhibit close relationships with mps concentration and water velocity furthermore our source tracking results demonstrated that the microbiome args and vfs in urban region mps were largely derived from rural region mps our results caution us that special attention should be paid to the risks posed by mps in urban water bodies and highlight the threat of mps from rural upstream areas graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords field microplastics microbiome antibiotic resistance genes virulence factors environmental risk data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microplastics mps have aroused extensive interest as rapidly proliferating anthropogenic contaminants because of their wide distribution in various environments including marine environment lakes rivers sediments air soil and inhabiting organisms selonen et al 2020 wang et al 2020 wright et al 2020 according to an empirical model approximately 2 4 million tons of plastic waste enters the ocean through rivers every year lebreton et al 2017 resulting in severe oceanic plastic pollution seltenrich 2015 once mps enter the river a stable matrix for microorganisms and new ecological niches termed as plastisphere are generated zettler et al 2013 extensive studies have revealed the occurrence functioning metabolism and spread of bacterial and fungal communities on riverine plastisphere using 16s 18s and its methods amaral zettler et al 2020 dąbrowska 2021 currently with the extensive use of high throughput sequencing hts based metagenomic analysis in the plastispheres zettler et al 2013 an unprecedented broad overview of the diversity and abundance of genetic elements and comprehensive awareness of microbial function and metabolism were brought to the forefront li et al 2020 furthermore the exchange of the antibiotic resistome ar between the plastisphere and surrounding water has been also reported based on hts yang et al 2020 however majority of the previous studies focused on the constituents of the plastispheres using in situ incubation experiments yang et al 2020 li et al 2021 to date the sources of microorganisms and genetic elements and the environmental risks of field mps have not been studied in detail recently several studies have attempted source tracking for the microbiome in the plastisphere but failed to obtain desirable results source tracker a bayesian algorithm is a tool for tracking the probable source of microbial taxa knights et al 2011 it could detect less than 10 of microorganisms in urban region plastic debris that were derived from upstream sources xue et al 2020 to overcome the limitations of source tracker such as its reliance on indicator species and only reflecting a specific environmental condition simpson et al 2002 feast fast expectation maximization for microbial source tracking shenhav et al 2019 was recently used for source tracking of in situ incubated riverine mps by which less than 40 of sources were detected li et al 2022 due to the immobility of mps microorganisms and genetic elements in the plastisphere during in situ incubation they cannot be transported and transmitted along the river which may account for the low contribution rates detected above nevertheless a large number of mps are transported and transmitted along the river providing greater opportunities for the transmissions and propagation of pathogens and args dann et al 2016 hurley et al 2018 liu et al 2020 therefore there is an urgent need for exploring sources and potential environmental risks of the microbiomes args and virulence factors vfs on field mps the study site was a watershed located 22 12 23 9 n 106 23 108 24 e at the sino vietnam border having two tributaries with a total length of 350 km this watershed originates from baise city china flowing through chongzuo city to nanning city china which are the upstream reaches of the pearl river south china the pearl river delta where the river flows is one of the most economically developed and densely populated areas in china based on metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatics analyzes of the microbiome args and vfs in the plastisphere the objectives of this study were to 1 determine the distribution patterns of the microbiome args and vfs on field mps along the watershed 2 analyze source of the microbiome and genetic elements in the plastisphere and 3 evaluate the potential environmental risk of field mps 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling a total of 22 different sampling locations were selected from the upstream 10 sites rural region midstream 4 sites peri

pursuit regression ppr model was used to synthetically assess the potential environmental risk of mps based on args and vfs from metagenomics this model was established according to our previous study using matlab 2013 zhu et al 2019 3 results 3 1 microbial taxa on mps along the watershed a total of 2484 million raw reads were generated from 22 river water samples corresponding to 15 5 million non redundant genes among all non redundant genes approximately 13 8 million were assigned to bacterial taxa 3099 to fungal taxa and 3823 to viral taxa in general the four most dominant bacterial phyla were proteobacteria actinobacteria acidobacteria and chloroflexi accounting for 44 8 24 7 9 2 and 6 1 of the total bacterial abundance respectively fig 1c fungi were dominated by the phyla ascomycota basidiomycota and mucoromycota accounting for 51 5 20 6 and 17 3 of the fungal abundance respectively uroviricota was the most dominant phylum in the viral population accounting for 95 2 of the viral abundance the microbial communities at phylum level were similar with previous results yang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 li et al 2022 pcoa of microbial taxa showed that the microbiomes on mps were clustered geographically particularly the significantly different distribution patterns of the microbiomes between upstream rural region and downstream urban region mps fig 1b moreover the relative abundance of some microbial phyla actinobacteria ascomycota and uroviricota significantly increased from upstream to urban regions p 0 05 fig 1c the relative abundances of the 20 most abundant bacterial species and 20 most abundant fungal species were much higher on mps collected from rural regions figs s1a and 1b whereas the 20 most abundant viral species were much higher on mps from urban regions compared to other reaches fig s1c additionally bacterial communities anosim r 0 199 p 0 05 fig s2a and viral communities anosim r 0 303 p 0 001 fig s2c at the species level showed statistical differences among different reaches whereas there was no significant difference in fungal communities anosim r 0 11 p 0 05 fig s2b however the composition of microbial communities and their total abundance on mps clearly varied between the sampling sites figs s3 and s4 furthermore the lefse lda results showed that 11 187 bacterial species 19 33 fungal species and 12 32 viral species were selectively enriched on mps collected from different reaches fig s5 venn diagram revealed that all the mp samples shared 25 390 bacterial species 233 fungal species and 68 viral species accounting for 81 7 62 6 and 10 7 of the total species detected respectively fig 1d the specific and shared bacteria fungi and viruses detected on mps at the species level are shown in figs s6 s7 and s8 respectively among the fungal population 46 species were found exclusively in the peri urban region samples accounting for 12 4 of the total fungal species detected dominated by verruconis gallopava corynespora cassiicola pezoloma ericae and colletotrichum shisoi fig s7 a total of 446 viral species were found only in the urban region samples accounting for 70 3 of the viral species detected these were dominated by nostoc phage n1 arthrobacter phage zartrosa streptomyces phage wakanda and arthrobacter phage faja figs 1d and s8 these results suggest that there could be a specific fungal source in rural regions and a specific viral source in urban regions 3 2 antibiotic resistance genes args on mps along the watershed to investigate the abundance and diversity of args non redundant genes from the 22 sampling sites were annotated based on the card database a total of 317 arg types consisting of 1211 subtypes including multidrug 43 58 tetracycline 10 88 mlsb 10 77 and glycopeptide 8 71 fig 2 a were detected on mps these classes of antibiotics commonly administered to humans and animals represent all major resistance mechanisms antibiotic efflux 62 1 antibiotic target alteration 19 2 antibiotic target protection 10 7 antibiotic target replacement 4 1 and antibiotic inactivation 3 8 although there was no significant difference in the relative gene copies of args and the number of arg subtypes detected on mps from different sampling sites arg profiles indicated distinct spatial clustering from rural to urban regions similar to the microbial community profiles fig 2b the distribution of args showed significant differences between rural and urban regions p 0 05 while non significant differences between peri urban and the other two regions p 0 05 suggesting that peri urban acts as a transition zone from rural to urban regions shannon indices of args detected on mps from different reaches demonstrated an increasing diversity of args from rural to urban regions fig 2c the args common in all samples with the top 50 relative abundances are shown in figs s9 and s10 among them the genes macb mls teta 58 tetracycline nova aminocoumarin bcra peptide and evgs multidrug were consistently detected in high abundance however the volcano plot revealed differences in arg profiles between rural and peri urban regions fourteen arg subtypes displayed significant differences and all were enriched in the peri urban region fig 2d notably the richness of oxa 205 in the peri urban region was 39 times higher than that in the rural region p 0 01 comparison of arg profiles from rural and urban regions revealed 47 arg subtypes that were significantly different of which 27 were enriched in the urban regions fig 2e the subtypes vanrn and srt 2 were 1 47 times and 1 44 times enriched in peri urban regions while they were 1 84 times and 1 83 times enriched in urban regions compared to the subtypes in rural regions respectively however the rest of the 25 arg subtypes demonstrated significant enrichment in the urban regions but not in the peri urban regions the increasing trend of enrichment of args on mps along the watershed signifies the increasing environmental risk of the plastisphere as the river flows down 3 3 virulence factors vfs on mps along the watershed a total of 397 vfs with four main vf types including offensive vfs nonspecific vfs defensive vfs and regulatory vfs were found in all samples among them the dominant vf subtypes were iron uptake system adherence secretion system regulation toxin and antiphagocytosis accounting for 23 5 20 3 13 2 10 5 10 and 9 9 of the total vf abundance respectively fig s11 no obvious differences were obtained for the number of vfs and relative copies of vfs detected on mps among difference sites p 0 05 fig 3 a however the pcoa of the vf profiles showed that the samples clustered geographically fig 3b volcano plot showed two vfs that significantly different between the rural and peri urban regions and were enriched in the peri urban regions fig 3d specifically there were 25 vfs significantly different between rural and urban regions 10 of which were enriched in urban regions fig 3e among them the relative abundance of mu toxin and mgtc in urban regions were 3 and 2 4 times higher than rural regions the mgtc is a vf in salmonella helping in the pathogen survival within the host oliveira et al 2003 mu toxin is one of the main components of c perfringens toxin complex zukaite and biziulevicius 2000 also enterobactin an archetype of microbial iron transport raymond et al 2003 was 1 8 times more abundant in peri urban regions than in rural regions interestingly the significantly enriched patterns of vfs in peri urban and urban regions showed a similar spatial distribution pattern with args profiles r2 0 24 p 0 01 fig 3c 3 4 co occurrence patterns among args vfs and the microbiome the co occurrence patterns of args vfs and their potential microbial hosts on mps were explored by network analysis p 0 01 pearson s correlation coefficient r2 0 7 fig 4 a and b notably dehalococcoidia bacterium was the only bacterial species in the rural region that showed positive correlations with one arg and three vfs detected fig 4a however 14 bacterial species were significantly positively correlated with both args and vfs in urban regions notably rhodopirellula sp was significantly positively correlated with nine args and one vf fig 4b the variation in the relative abundance of the 15 potential bacterial hosts carrying both args and vfs on mps from each sampling site is shown in fig 4c dehalococcoidia bacterium was detected in all three reaches indicating a widespread risk notably the relative abundance of majority of the potential bacterial hosts reached a maximum in the urban regions especially at sampling sites cz 1 cz 2 and cz 3 this could be an important reason for the significant enrichment of specific args and vfs in the plastisphere of urban regions 3 5 source tracker analysis of the microbiome args and vfs on mps along the watershed to evaluate the risk of mps functioning as carriers of the microbiome args and vfs laganà et al 2019 feast a source tracking approach was used to decipher the relationship between each sampling site and its rural region fig 5 the total contribution ratios of rural regions were 0 10 0 65 0 12 0 79 0 13 0 77 0 36 0 95 and 0 27 0 78 for the bacteria fungi viruses args and vfs in each sampling site respectively indicating that the microbiome args and vfs on urban region mps were largely derived from rural region mps tables s5 9 a similar geographical distribution pattern of the contribution ratios of rural regions was observed for bacteria fungi viruses args and vfs fig 5 in general the contribution ratio from rural to urban regions increased as the river flowed down however the highest contribution ratios were observed in the sampling sites of dt 2 and lz 1 which could be attributed to the high river velocity and short sampling interval table s1 furthermore the unknown part could be explained by the exchange of the plastispheres with the surrounding environment during mps transport from rural to urban regions jacquin et al 2019 and the anthropogenic implications from rural regions li et al 2022 overall these results revealed that mps as carrier rafts could transport the microbiome args and vfs for long distances along the river resulting in the upstream plastispheres that shape the abundance and structure of the microbiome args and vfs on mps in urban region 3 6 potential environmental risk of mps args and vfs are two important factors with potentially environmental risks so all the 317 args and 397 vfs detected on mps in this study were used to comprehensively evaluate the potentially environmental risk of mps by projecting high dimensional data into low dimensional space ppr model has a great ability to decipher the intrinsic law of high dimensional data e g hundreds of args and vfs in this study all the detected args and vfs were incorporated into the ppr model to comprehensively evaluate the potential environmental risk of mps fig 6 depicts the projected values of mps detected in the rural peri urban and urban regions based on 100 randomized trials compared to rural regions a significantly higher potential environmental risk of mps was observed in both peri urban p 0 001 and urban regions p 0 001 however the difference between peri urban and urban regions p 0 05 was not significant fig 6a the projected values of mps were concentrated below 0 5 in rural regions whereas in peri urban and urban regions they were concentrated to more than 1 5 times indicating that the potential environmental risk of mps in peri urban and urban regions was much higher than that in rural regions to further explore the factors influencing the potential environmental risk of mps linear regression analysis was performed between the ppr model derived projected values and mp concentration antibiotic concentration and water velocity a significant positive correlation p 0 023 r 0 49 was observed between the projected values and mps concentration fig 6c in contrast the projected values were significantly negatively correlated with water velocity p 0 008 r 0 56 fig 6d 4 discussion in this study a total of 317 args and 397 vfs were detected on field mps along the watershed both args and vfs on field mps showed significant geographical distribution patterns from rural to urban regions the diversity of args significantly increased with the increase of urbanization notably 14 args and 27 args were significantly enriched in peri urban and urban regions in comparison with the rural region for example the relative abundance of oxa 205 in peri urban was 39 times higher than rural region which was first found in in 671 a novel class 1 integron in a clinical pseudomonas aeruginosa krasauskas et al 2015 once pathogens e g pseudomonas aeruginosa carrying the oxa 205 gene infect humans it will cause the failure of β lactam antibiotics treatments in clinic a previous study also found the oxa 205 gene in activated sludge from wastewater treatment plants suggesting the risk of this vf spreading through the environment zhang et al 2021 unfortunately many args to vancomycin e g vanrn vano vanxi etc were significantly enriched on mps of peri urban and urban regions although vancomycin is considered as the last line of defense available in the clinic for treating multidrug resistant bacterial infections nicolaou and christopher 2002 the vfs on field mps showed similar geographical patterns to args and parts of vfs were significantly enriched in peri urban and urban mps for example the relative abundance of mgtc gene of urban region was 2 4 times higher than that of rural region and this gene could help in the pathogen e g salmonella survival within the host oliveira et al 2003 moreover salmonella is one of the most important foodborne pathogens efsa ecdc 2017 therefore significant enrichment of these args and vfs carried by field mps in rivers will pose a serious threat to the environmental safety and human health another important finding is the significant co occurrence patterns among args vfs and bacteria on field mps especially in the urban region fig 4b this suggests that some args and vfs may be located in the same host bacteria and the colonization of these host bacteria on field mps would result in a multiplied risk of environmental transmission a total of 15 potential host bacteria with co occurrences of args and vfs were identified from urban region much higher than rural region fig 4a and b moreover we also found that the relative abundance of the potential host bacteria was much higher on mps of urban regions than those of rural and peri urban regions fig 4c more importantly some potential host bacteria of both args and vfs are typical pathogens for human and aquatic organisms liang et al 2020 for instance roseomonas sp enriched in urban mps can cause bacteremia or catheter related infections in cancer patients de et al 2004 betaproteobacteria bacterium also enriched in the mps in urban regions can cause the epitheliocystis disease in fish gills elena et al 2012 in addition numerous pathogens were also detected on mps of peri urban and urban regions corresponding to different types of hosts e g house mice humans and roundworms table s10 kaur et al 2022 the reason why vfs and args are so scary is that one can make humans and animals sick and the other can develop resistance for antibiotic treatments ben et al 2019 bondarczuk et al 2016 therefore we used the ppr model to explore the potential risk of field mps based on all the args and vfs detected the results showed that mps in peri urban and urban regions had higher potential environmental risk in comparisons to rural regions and the projection values had significantly positive correlations with mps concentration fig 6a and c one possible reason for the higher potential risk in urban region is the large scale of production and usage of plastic products including plastic bags disposable tableware and synthetic fabrics which causes a great deal of input of mps into the urban river xu et al 2021 in addition polypropylene one of the most commonly used plastics e g medical mask beverage bottle was much more in urban regions than that in rural regions table s2 which may be related to higher population density and more plastic use in urban regions we also found some args e g beta lactam and vfs e g martx enriched in rural regions in comparison with urban regions figs 2e and 3e which all associated with livestock or fish farming in rural regions zhu et al 2013 carmona salido et al 2021 we also compared the composition of plastispheres in this study with those from previous in situ incubation experiments and found significant differences in the abundance and diversity of the microbiome and ars on the mps text s3 field studies consistently exhibited more diverse mp characteristics than in situ incubation tables s2 s4 and s5 and different microbial taxa display distinct selective colonization on different types of mps mp as a raft carries args and vfs from upstream to downstream in the watershed exacerbating the potential environmental risk of the plastisphere overall it is essential to accurately evaluate the distribution patterns and environmental risks of mps in the field rather than in situ incubation experiments source tracker is a useful tool for analyzing the sources of pollutants in the environment xue et al 2020 nevertheless various factors e g spatiotemporal variability environmental complexity and inherent method limitation confounded accurate source tracking in previous studies and the traditional source tracker method has limitation of distinguishing the sources of similar materials li et al 2020 in this study we used the newly established feast method for community based microbial source tracking based on metagenome data to overcome the above limitations shenhav et al 2019 our results clearly demonstrated that bacteria fungi viruses args and vfs on mps at each sampling site were largely derived from the plastisphere in rural regions fig 5 providing further evidence for the dissemination of field mps along the watershed dann et al 2016 carrying microbes and harmful genetic elements guo et al 2012 turner and holmes 2015 moreover unknown sources from anthropogenic implications or the exchange of plastispheres including horizontal gene transfer with the surrounding environment may be another important source of microbes and harmful genetic elements jacquin et al 2019 li et al 2022 5 conclusion currently comprehensive relevant data for evaluating the potential environmental risk of mps at the watershed scale are lacking this study revealed that urbanization increases the environmental risks of mps through args and vfs mps in urban regions of the watershed harbor abundant specific args and vfs compared to those in rural regions the ppr model predicted that mps in peri urban and urban regions had a higher potential environmental risk and displayed a significantly positive correlation with mps concentration the relative abundance of potential bacterial hosts with the co occurrence of args and vfs is higher in urban regions than in the peri urban and rural regions thus posing a higher potential microbiological risk furthermore source tracking results unraveled that the microbiome args and vfs on mps at each sampling site are largely derived from the rural region mps demonstrating that as a carrier raft mps could carry and spread pathogens and genetic elements with high environmental risk among different sites linking the

15601,microplastics mps are emerging as anthropogenic vectors for the colonization and transportation of microbial communities in aquatic ecosystems however the composition of the microbiome and its environmental risk on field mps at watershed scale has rarely been explored here geographical distributions of microbiome antibiotic resistance genes args and virulence factors vfs on field mps at watershed scale were characterized and their potential environmental risks were evaluated based on the data from metagenomic analyzes the succession of microbial communities on mps was observed along the watershed and some args and vfs were significantly enriched on mps in urban region in comparison with rural region potential environmental risk of mps conducted by projection pursuit regression model in midstream peri urban region and downstream urban region were significantly higher than that in upstream rural region and exhibit close relationships with mps concentration and water velocity furthermore our source tracking results demonstrated that the microbiome args and vfs in urban region mps were largely derived from rural region mps our results caution us that special attention should be paid to the risks posed by mps in urban water bodies and highlight the threat of mps from rural upstream areas graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords field microplastics microbiome antibiotic resistance genes virulence factors environmental risk data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microplastics mps have aroused extensive interest as rapidly proliferating anthropogenic contaminants because of their wide distribution in various environments including marine environment lakes rivers sediments air soil and inhabiting organisms selonen et al 2020 wang et al 2020 wright et al 2020 according to an empirical model approximately 2 4 million tons of plastic waste enters the ocean through rivers every year lebreton et al 2017 resulting in severe oceanic plastic pollution seltenrich 2015 once mps enter the river a stable matrix for microorganisms and new ecological niches termed as plastisphere are generated zettler et al 2013 extensive studies have revealed the occurrence functioning metabolism and spread of bacterial and fungal communities on riverine plastisphere using 16s 18s and its methods amaral zettler et al 2020 dąbrowska 2021 currently with the extensive use of high throughput sequencing hts based metagenomic analysis in the plastispheres zettler et al 2013 an unprecedented broad overview of the diversity and abundance of genetic elements and comprehensive awareness of microbial function and metabolism were brought to the forefront li et al 2020 furthermore the exchange of the antibiotic resistome ar between the plastisphere and surrounding water has been also reported based on hts yang et al 2020 however majority of the previous studies focused on the constituents of the plastispheres using in situ incubation experiments yang et al 2020 li et al 2021 to date the sources of microorganisms and genetic elements and the environmental risks of field mps have not been studied in detail recently several studies have attempted source tracking for the microbiome in the plastisphere but failed to obtain desirable results source tracker a bayesian algorithm is a tool for tracking the probable source of microbial taxa knights et al 2011 it could detect less than 10 of microorganisms in urban region plastic debris that were derived from upstream sources xue et al 2020 to overcome the limitations of source tracker such as its reliance on indicator species and only reflecting a specific environmental condition simpson et al 2002 feast fast expectation maximization for microbial source tracking shenhav et al 2019 was recently used for source tracking of in situ incubated riverine mps by which less than 40 of sources were detected li et al 2022 due to the immobility of mps microorganisms and genetic elements in the plastisphere during in situ incubation they cannot be transported and transmitted along the river which may account for the low contribution rates detected above nevertheless a large number of mps are transported and transmitted along the river providing greater opportunities for the transmissions and propagation of pathogens and args dann et al 2016 hurley et al 2018 liu et al 2020 therefore there is an urgent need for exploring sources and potential environmental risks of the microbiomes args and virulence factors vfs on field mps the study site was a watershed located 22 12 23 9 n 106 23 108 24 e at the sino vietnam border having two tributaries with a total length of 350 km this watershed originates from baise city china flowing through chongzuo city to nanning city china which are the upstream reaches of the pearl river south china the pearl river delta where the river flows is one of the most economically developed and densely populated areas in china based on metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatics analyzes of the microbiome args and vfs in the plastisphere the objectives of this study were to 1 determine the distribution patterns of the microbiome args and vfs on field mps along the watershed 2 analyze source of the microbiome and genetic elements in the plastisphere and 3 evaluate the potential environmental risk of field mps 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling a total of 22 different sampling locations were selected from the upstream 10 sites rural region midstream 4 sites peri urban region and downstream 8 sites urban region regions of the watershed fig 1 a detailed information for each sampling site is provided in table s1 the sampling time was from january 10 to 17th 2022

abundance and characteristics of the detected mps are shown in table s2 2 3 dna extraction and metagenomic analysis all the collected mps were used to extract dna in each sampling sites the fast dna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals santa ana usa was used to extract total genomic dna from the abovementioned pbs samples section 2 2 according to the manufacturer s instructions ultraviolet absorbance nd1000 nanodrop usa was used to check the quality of dna on agarose gel while the quantifluor dsdna kit promega was used to check the purity and concentration of dna in a 96 well microplate reader spectramax m5 usa dna was diluted to 50 ng μl using sterile water to obtain optimal results using covaris m220 and nextflex rapid dna seq bioscientific austin tx usa paired end library was constructed while dna was fragmented to an average size of approximately 300 base pairs bp illumina novaseq illumina inc san diego ca usa was used to perform paired end sequencing based on the standard protocols proposed by shanghai majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd fastp https github com opengene fastp was used for the quality filtering of raw fastq files the original sequencing data contain splice sequences low quality bases too short length bases and n bases n represents uncertain base information which will affect the quality of subsequent analysis therefore reads with lengths less than 50 bp

pursuit regression ppr model was used to synthetically assess the potential environmental risk of mps based on args and vfs from metagenomics this model was established according to our previous study using matlab 2013 zhu et al 2019 3 results 3 1 microbial taxa on mps along the watershed a total of 2484 million raw reads were generated from 22 river water samples corresponding to 15 5 million non redundant genes among all non redundant genes approximately 13 8 million were assigned to bacterial taxa 3099 to fungal taxa and 3823 to viral taxa in general the four most dominant bacterial phyla were proteobacteria actinobacteria acidobacteria and chloroflexi accounting for 44 8 24 7 9 2 and 6 1 of the total bacterial abundance respectively fig 1c fungi were dominated by the phyla ascomycota basidiomycota and mucoromycota accounting for 51 5 20 6 and 17 3 of the fungal abundance respectively uroviricota was the most dominant phylum in the viral population accounting for 95 2 of the viral abundance the microbial communities at phylum level were similar with previous results yang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 li et al 2022 pcoa of microbial taxa showed that the microbiomes on mps were clustered geographically particularly the significantly different distribution patterns of the microbiomes between upstream rural region and downstream urban region mps fig 1b moreover the relative abundance of some microbial phyla actinobacteria ascomycota and uroviricota significantly increased from upstream to urban regions p 0 05 fig 1c the relative abundances of the 20 most abundant bacterial species and 20 most abundant fungal species were much higher on mps collected from rural regions figs s1a and 1b whereas the 20 most abundant viral species were much higher on mps from urban regions compared to other reaches fig s1c additionally bacterial communities anosim r 0 199 p 0 05 fig s2a and viral communities anosim r 0 303 p 0 001 fig s2c at the species level showed statistical differences among different reaches whereas there was no significant difference in fungal communities anosim r 0 11 p 0 05 fig s2b however the composition of microbial communities and their total abundance on mps clearly varied between the sampling sites figs s3 and s4 furthermore the lefse lda results showed that 11 187 bacterial species 19 33 fungal species and 12 32 viral species were selectively enriched on mps collected from different reaches fig s5 venn diagram revealed that all the mp samples shared 25 390 bacterial species 233 fungal species and 68 viral species accounting for 81 7 62 6 and 10 7 of the total species detected respectively fig 1d the specific and shared bacteria fungi and viruses detected on mps at the species level are shown in figs s6 s7 and s8 respectively among the fungal population 46 species were found exclusively in the peri urban region samples accounting for 12 4 of the total fungal species detected dominated by verruconis gallopava corynespora cassiicola pezoloma ericae and colletotrichum shisoi fig s7 a total of 446 viral species were found only in the urban region samples accounting for 70 3 of the viral species detected these were dominated by nostoc phage n1 arthrobacter phage zartrosa streptomyces phage wakanda and arthrobacter phage faja figs 1d and s8 these results suggest that there could be a specific fungal source in rural regions and a specific viral source in urban regions 3 2 antibiotic resistance genes args on mps along the watershed to investigate the abundance and diversity of args non redundant genes from the 22 sampling sites were annotated based on the card database a total of 317 arg types consisting of 1211 subtypes including multidrug 43 58 tetracycline 10 88 mlsb 10 77 and glycopeptide 8 71 fig 2 a were detected on mps these classes of antibiotics commonly administered to humans and animals represent all major resistance mechanisms antibiotic efflux 62 1 antibiotic target alteration 19 2 antibiotic target protection 10 7 antibiotic target replacement 4 1 and antibiotic inactivation 3 8 although there was no significant difference in the relative gene copies of args and the number of arg subtypes detected on mps from different sampling sites arg profiles indicated distinct spatial clustering from rural to urban regions similar to the microbial community profiles fig 2b the distribution of args showed significant differences between rural and urban regions p 0 05 while non significant differences between peri urban and the other two regions p 0 05 suggesting that peri urban acts as a transition zone from rural to urban regions shannon indices of args detected on mps from different reaches demonstrated an increasing diversity of args from rural to urban regions fig 2c the args common in all samples with the top 50 relative abundances are shown in figs s9 and s10 among them the genes macb mls teta 58 tetracycline nova aminocoumarin bcra peptide and evgs multidrug were consistently detected in high abundance however the volcano plot revealed differences in arg profiles between rural and peri urban regions fourteen arg subtypes displayed significant differences and all were enriched in the peri urban region fig 2d notably the richness of oxa 205 in the peri urban region was 39 times higher than that in the rural region p 0 01 comparison of arg profiles from rural and urban regions revealed 47 arg subtypes that were significantly different of which 27 were enriched in the urban regions fig 2e the subtypes vanrn and srt 2 were 1 47 times and 1 44 times enriched in peri urban regions while they were 1 84 times and 1 83 times enriched in urban regions compared to the subtypes in rural regions respectively however the rest of the 25 arg subtypes demonstrated significant enrichment in the urban regions but not in the peri urban regions the increasing trend of enrichment of args on mps along the watershed signifies the increasing environmental risk of the plastisphere as the river flows down 3 3 virulence factors vfs on mps along the watershed a total of 397 vfs with four main vf types including offensive vfs nonspecific vfs defensive vfs and regulatory vfs were found in all samples among them the dominant vf subtypes were iron uptake system adherence secretion system regulation toxin and antiphagocytosis accounting for 23 5 20 3 13 2 10 5 10 and 9 9 of the total vf abundance respectively fig s11 no obvious differences were obtained for the number of vfs and relative copies of vfs detected on mps among difference sites p 0 05 fig 3 a however the pcoa of the vf profiles showed that the samples clustered geographically fig 3b volcano plot showed two vfs that significantly different between the rural and peri urban regions and were enriched in the peri urban regions fig 3d specifically there were 25 vfs significantly different between rural and urban regions 10 of which were enriched in urban regions fig 3e among them the relative abundance of mu toxin and mgtc in urban regions were 3 and 2 4 times higher than rural regions the mgtc is a vf in salmonella helping in the pathogen survival within the host oliveira et al 2003 mu toxin is one of the main components of c perfringens toxin complex zukaite and biziulevicius 2000 also enterobactin an archetype of microbial iron transport raymond et al 2003 was 1 8 times more abundant in peri urban regions than in rural regions interestingly the significantly enriched patterns of vfs in peri urban and urban regions showed a similar spatial distribution pattern with args profiles r2 0 24 p 0 01 fig 3c 3 4 co occurrence patterns among args vfs and the microbiome the co occurrence patterns of args vfs and their potential microbial hosts on mps were explored by network analysis p 0 01 pearson s correlation coefficient r2 0 7 fig 4 a and b notably dehalococcoidia bacterium was the only bacterial species in the rural region that showed positive correlations with one arg and three vfs detected fig 4a however 14 bacterial species were significantly positively correlated with both args and vfs in urban regions notably rhodopirellula sp was significantly positively correlated with nine args and one vf fig 4b the variation in the relative abundance of the 15 potential bacterial hosts carrying both args and vfs on mps from each sampling site is shown in fig 4c dehalococcoidia bacterium was detected in all three reaches indicating a widespread risk notably the relative abundance of majority of the potential bacterial hosts reached a maximum in the urban regions especially at sampling sites cz 1 cz 2 and cz 3 this could be an important reason for the significant enrichment of specific args and vfs in the plastisphere of urban regions 3 5 source tracker analysis of the microbiome args and vfs on mps along the watershed to evaluate the risk of mps functioning as carriers of the microbiome args and vfs laganà et al 2019 feast a source tracking approach was used to decipher the relationship between each sampling site and its rural region fig 5 the total contribution ratios of rural regions were 0 10 0 65 0 12 0 79 0 13 0 77 0 36 0 95 and 0 27 0 78 for the bacteria fungi viruses args and vfs in each sampling site respectively indicating that the microbiome args and vfs on urban region mps were largely derived from rural region mps tables s5 9 a similar geographical distribution pattern of the contribution ratios of rural regions was observed for bacteria fungi viruses args and vfs fig 5 in general the contribution ratio from rural to urban regions increased as the river flowed down however the highest contribution ratios were observed in the sampling sites of dt 2 and lz 1 which could be attributed to the high river velocity and short sampling interval table s1 furthermore the unknown part could be explained by the exchange of the plastispheres with the surrounding environment during mps transport from rural to urban regions jacquin et al 2019 and the anthropogenic implications from rural regions li et al 2022 overall these results revealed that mps as carrier rafts could transport the microbiome args and vfs for long distances along the river resulting in the upstream plastispheres that shape the abundance and structure of the microbiome args and vfs on mps in urban region 3 6 potential environmental risk of mps args and vfs are two important factors with potentially environmental risks so all the 317 args and 397 vfs detected on mps in this study were used to comprehensively evaluate the potentially environmental risk of mps by projecting high dimensional data into low dimensional space ppr model has a great ability to decipher the intrinsic law of high dimensional data e g hundreds of args and vfs in this study all the detected args and vfs were incorporated into the ppr model to comprehensively evaluate the potential environmental risk of mps fig 6 depicts the projected values of mps detected in the rural peri urban and urban regions based on 100 randomized trials compared to rural regions a significantly higher potential environmental risk of mps was observed in both peri urban p 0 001 and urban regions p 0 001 however the difference between peri urban and urban regions p 0 05 was not significant fig 6a the projected values of mps were concentrated below 0 5 in rural regions whereas in peri urban and urban regions they were concentrated to more than 1 5 times indicating that the potential environmental risk of mps in peri urban and urban regions was much higher than that in rural regions to further explore the factors influencing the potential environmental risk of mps linear regression analysis was performed between the ppr model derived projected values and mp concentration antibiotic concentration and water velocity a significant positive correlation p 0 023 r 0 49 was observed between the projected values and mps concentration fig 6c in contrast the projected values were significantly negatively correlated with water velocity p 0 008 r 0 56 fig 6d 4 discussion in this study a total of 317 args and 397 vfs were detected on field mps along the watershed both args and vfs on field mps showed significant geographical distribution patterns from rural to urban regions the diversity of args significantly increased with the increase of urbanization notably 14 args and 27 args were significantly enriched in peri urban and urban regions in comparison with the rural region for example the relative abundance of oxa 205 in peri urban was 39 times higher than rural region which was first found in in 671 a novel class 1 integron in a clinical pseudomonas aeruginosa krasauskas et al 2015 once pathogens e g pseudomonas aeruginosa carrying the oxa 205 gene infect humans it will cause the failure of β lactam antibiotics treatments in clinic a previous study also found the oxa 205 gene in activated sludge from wastewater treatment plants suggesting the risk of this vf spreading through the environment zhang et al 2021 unfortunately many args to vancomycin e g vanrn vano vanxi etc were significantly enriched on mps of peri urban and urban regions although vancomycin is considered as the last line of defense available in the clinic for treating multidrug resistant bacterial infections nicolaou and christopher 2002 the vfs on field mps showed similar geographical patterns to args and parts of vfs were significantly enriched in peri urban and urban mps for example the relative abundance of mgtc gene of urban region was 2 4 times higher than that of rural region and this gene could help in the pathogen e g salmonella survival within the host oliveira et al 2003 moreover salmonella is one of the most important foodborne pathogens efsa ecdc 2017 therefore significant enrichment of these args and vfs carried by field mps in rivers will pose a serious threat to the environmental safety and human health another important finding is the significant co occurrence patterns among args vfs and bacteria on field mps especially in the urban region fig 4b this suggests that some args and vfs may be located in the same host bacteria and the colonization of these host bacteria on field mps would result in a multiplied risk of environmental transmission a total of 15 potential host bacteria with co occurrences of args and vfs were identified from urban region much higher than rural region fig 4a and b moreover we also found that the relative abundance of the potential host bacteria was much higher on mps of urban regions than those of rural and peri urban regions fig 4c more importantly some potential host bacteria of both args and vfs are typical pathogens for human and aquatic organisms liang et al 2020 for instance roseomonas sp enriched in urban mps can cause bacteremia or catheter related infections in cancer patients de et al 2004 betaproteobacteria bacterium also enriched in the mps in urban regions can cause the epitheliocystis disease in fish gills elena et al 2012 in addition numerous pathogens were also detected on mps of peri urban and urban regions corresponding to different types of hosts e g house mice humans and roundworms table s10 kaur et al 2022 the reason why vfs and args are so scary is that one can make humans and animals sick and the other can develop resistance for antibiotic treatments ben et al 2019 bondarczuk et al 2016 therefore we used the ppr model to explore the potential risk of field mps based on all the args and vfs detected the results showed that mps in peri urban and urban regions had higher potential environmental risk in comparisons to rural regions and the projection values had significantly positive correlations with mps concentration fig 6a and c one possible reason for the higher potential risk in urban region is the large scale of production and usage of plastic products including plastic bags disposable tableware and synthetic fabrics which causes a great deal of input of mps into the urban river xu et al 2021 in addition polypropylene one of the most commonly used plastics e g medical mask beverage bottle was much more in urban regions than that in rural regions table s2 which may be related to higher population density and more plastic use in urban regions we also found some args e g beta lactam and vfs e g martx enriched in rural regions in comparison with urban regions figs 2e and 3e which all associated with livestock or fish farming in rural regions zhu et al 2013 carmona salido et al 2021 we also compared the composition of plastispheres in this study with those from previous in situ incubation experiments and found significant differences in the abundance and diversity of the microbiome and ars on the mps text s3 field studies consistently exhibited more diverse mp characteristics than in situ incubation tables s2 s4 and s5 and different microbial taxa display distinct selective colonization on different types of mps mp as a raft carries args and vfs from upstream to downstream in the watershed exacerbating the potential environmental risk of the plastisphere overall it is essential to accurately evaluate the distribution patterns and environmental risks of mps in the field rather than in situ incubation experiments source tracker is a useful tool for analyzing the sources of pollutants in the environment xue et al 2020 nevertheless various factors e g spatiotemporal variability environmental complexity and inherent method limitation confounded accurate source tracking in previous studies and the traditional source tracker method has limitation of distinguishing the sources of similar materials li et al 2020 in this study we used the newly established feast method for community based microbial source tracking based on metagenome data to overcome the above limitations shenhav et al 2019 our results clearly demonstrated that bacteria fungi viruses args and vfs on mps at each sampling site were largely derived from the plastisphere in rural regions fig 5 providing further evidence for the dissemination of field mps along the watershed dann et al 2016 carrying microbes and harmful genetic elements guo et al 2012 turner and holmes 2015 moreover unknown sources from anthropogenic implications or the exchange of plastispheres including horizontal gene transfer with the surrounding environment may be another important source of microbes and harmful genetic elements jacquin et al 2019 li et al 2022 5 conclusion currently comprehensive relevant data for evaluating the potential environmental risk of mps at the watershed scale are lacking this study revealed that urbanization increases the environmental risks of mps through args and vfs mps in urban regions of the watershed harbor abundant specific args and vfs compared to those in rural regions the ppr model predicted that mps in peri urban and urban regions had a higher potential environmental risk and displayed a significantly positive correlation with mps concentration the relative abundance of potential bacterial hosts with the co occurrence of args and vfs is higher in urban regions than in the

15602,anaerobic technology is extensively applied in the treatment of industrial organic wastewater but high salinity always triggers microbial cell dehydration causing the failure of the anaerobic process in this work betaine one kind of compatible solutes which could balance the osmotic pressure of anaerobic biomass was exogenously added for enhancing the anaerobic reduction of nitrobenzene nb at high salinity only 100 mg l 1 betaine dosing could significantly promote the removal efficiency of nb within 35 h at 9 salinity 36 92 4 02 without betaine and 72 94 6 57 with betaine the relieving effects on salt stress could be observed in the promotion of more extracellular polymeric substances eps secretion with betaine addition additionally the oxidation reduction potential orp as well as the electron transfer system ets value was increased with betaine addition which was reflected in the improvement of system removal efficiency and enzyme activity microbial community analysis demonstrated that bacillus and clostridiisalibacter which were positively correlated with the stability of the anaerobic process were enriched with betaine addition at high salinity metagenomic analysis speculated that the encoding genes for salt tolerance kdpb oada beta opud epsp epsh and nb degradation nfsa wrba ccda menc obtained higher relative abundance with betaine addition under high salt environment which might be the key to improving salt tolerance of anaerobic biomass the long term assessment demonstrated that exogenous addition betaine played an important role in maintaining the stability of the anaerobic system which would be a potential strategy to achieve a high efficiency anaerobic process under high salinity conditions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords high salinity anaerobic reduction betaine extracellular polymeric substances salt tolerance mechanism data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction during the past few decades industrial activities such as pharmaceuticals textile dyes and pesticides production generated a large amount of industrial wastewater containing a high concentration of organic matter and salts in which salinities ranged from 1 to 20 mao et al 2022 guo et al 2020a in general high salt wastewater refers to the wastewater with a total salt content of more than 1 w v nacl song et al 2021 at present many technologies such as advanced oxidation and ion exchange had been successfully applied to the treatment of high salt wastewater however the high cost and operational complexity had become technical bottlenecks aher et al 2017 biological treatment had been widely used as a cost effective treatment method while anaerobic biological treatment was more conducive to the removal of refractory organic contaminants nonetheless high salt concentration always triggers cell dehydration causing the failure of the anaerobic process bremer and krämer 2019 there are two main strategies for microbes to be subject to osmoregulation one is called the salt in strategy the other is the compatible solute strategy hu et al 2020 with respect to the salt in strategy inorganic ions k and cl are accumulated and then pumped into the cell membrane to help microbes adapt to salt fluctuation sudmalis et al 2018a this process usually requires the participation of enzymes like ribokinase and atpase and more energetically cost bremer and krämer 2019 besides it frequently occurs in extremely halophilic archaea as to compatible solutes strategy it is the most commonly used strategy by microbes to maintain the cell turgor pressure by reducing the osmotic pressure difference between the inside and outside of the cells various types of molecules can be used as compatible solutes like trehalose betaine ectoine and glutamic acid which are considered as highly water soluble organic osmolytes sudmalis et al 2018a most of microbes can synthesize compatible solutes however in extreme environments 1 salinity cells prefer to absorb compatible solutes from the environment rather than synthesize them song et al 2020 exogenous addition of compatible solutes might be a potential strategy to achieve a high efficiency anaerobic process under high salinity conditions among the various kinds of compatible solutes betaine is of considerable industrial importance due to its function of osmotic regulation zhu et al 2020 liu et al 2014 demonstrated that betaine was the most effective compatible solutes among betaine trehalose and ectoine which did great importance in alleviating salt toxicity in anammox process it has been proved that exogenously added betaine could remarkably improve cell growth of rhodococcus sp hx 2 and degradation efficiency of diesel oil at 10 salinity in which the expression of betaine transporter encoding genes h0 h1 h3 h5 and synthesis genes betb would be induced by saline stress hu et al 2020 in addition to balancing the osmotic pressure betaine possessed the ability to protect intracellular enzymes and organelles under saline stress zuo et al 2021 studies also found that betaine would be able to modify gene expression and activity of several enzymes in animals plants and microorganisms because betaine is now known to be involved in a large number of cellular and biochemical processes figueroa soto and valenzuela soto 2018 however the combined effect of saline stress and betaine addition on the anaerobic process for the removal of refractory organic contaminants has yet to be fully elucidated meanwhile previously reported studies merely focused on the performance of pollutant removal but overlooked the microbial metabolism and genetic expression influenced by salinity and betaine in this study betaine was exogenously added to balance the osmotic pressure of anaerobic biomass nitrobenzene nb was chosen as the model pollutant for its wide application and high biotoxicity lu et al 2021 due to the strong electron affinity of the nitro group nb was resistant to biological oxidation therefore nb was usually removed through anaerobic process in which nb could be reductively transformed into less toxic aniline an with organic substances serving as electron donors as the salinity in the general industrial wastewater containing nb usually ranged from 3 to 10 zheng et al 2009 it is essential to investigate the effects of high salinity on the biodegradation of nb the main objectives were as followed 1 exploring the effects of betaine on nb biodegradation and microbial metabolism with betaine addition at high salinity 2 assessing the succession dynamics of the microbial community and functional genes in the presence of betaine at high salinity 3 proposing the possible enhancing mechanism for nb degradation with betaine addition at high salinity 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and inoculation all chemicals used in this study were purchased from aladdin shanghai china including nitrobenzene nb 98 which were all analytically pure the anaerobic sludge used in batch experiments was obtained from a local wastewater treatment plant of a chemical factory liaoyang liaoning province china the anaerobic sludge in the following batch experiments was acclimated to its corresponding salt concentration for 30 days to achieve optimal degradation performance 2 2 experimental design to evaluate the effects of betaine on nb biodegradation at different salinities batch experiments were conducted in 100 ml serum bottles with 1 15 0 05 g volatile suspended solids vss per liter of acclimatized anaerobic sludge the components of the synthetic wastewater were as followed nahco3 1 5 g l 1 kh2po4 0 22 g l 1 mgso4 7h2o 0 05 g l 1 nh4cl 1 02 g l 1 and cacl2 0 05 g l 1 sudmalis et al 2018b and 500 mg l 1 glucose was used as the electron donor according to zhang et al 2019a while the concentration of nb was 100 mg l 1 whereas the control group was the one without betaine addition and the experimental group was the one with 100 mg l 1 betaine addition after being purged into n2 and then sealed with stoppers all the bottles were put into the shaker and ultimately conducted at 35 c 180 rpm the effect of high salinity on nb degradation was investigated with salt concentrations varying from 0 to 12 w v calculated by nacl besides the betaine addition was studied at 0 to 250 mg l 1 when the salinity was maintained at 9 all batch experiments ran for 72 h and all experiments were carried out in triplicates two cylindrical up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors made of plexiglass with an inner diameter of 6 cm a height of 35 cm and an effective volume of about 1 1 l were designed for long term operation the biomass was the same as that used in the batch experiments the hydraulic retention time hrt and operating temperature was maintained at 20 h and 35 1 c respectively the influent salinity was increased gradually as the following levels step by step 0 1 5 3 4 5 and 6 and 100 mg l 1 betaine was continually added during the whole long term operation the composition of synthetic wastewater is the same as the batch test while the content of nb is 400 mg l 1 and the group without betaine addition was r while with 100 mg l 1 betaine addition was r 2 3 analytical methods before analyzing all the water samples were passed through 0 22 μm filter membrane and each measurement was conducted in triplicates nb and aniline an concentrations were measured by using high performance liquid chromatography hplc waters 2695 america according to zhang et al 2019b the method for hplc ms was depicted in the text s1 the calculation formula for nb removal efficiency and an formation efficiency was described in text s2 the morphology of anaerobic sludge under different salt concentrations was observed by a cold field emission scanning electron microscopy sem s 4800 ii fesem hitachi japan for batch experiment sludge samples with without 100 mg l 1 betaine addition at 0 and 9 salinity were collected after 35 h inoculation for ets eps orp and relative enzyme activity characterizations the uv visible spectrophotometer uv vis lambda 25 perkinelmer america and orp measuring instrument orp fe20k mettle switzerland were used to detect electron transport system ets and oxidation reduction potential orp respectively the extracellular polymeric substances eps extraction was according to su et al 2019 and the components of eps including protein pn as well as polysaccharides ps were measured by uv vis according to zhang et al 2017 the enzyme activities of nitroreductases nrs and nad p h were detected by jlc a701 48t and jlca880 48t shanghai jingkang biology engineering co ltd respectively 2 4 dna extraction and high throughput sequencing the microbial community structure in the anaerobic sludge at different salinities with or without betaine addition after a multi cycle operation for 30 days was analyzed through high throughput sequencing four sludge samples were collected for dna extraction whose sample names were as followed 0 salinity c 0 salinity with betaine addition g 9 salinity s 9 salinity with betaine addition sg the methods of genomic dna extraction and pcr amplification were according to shi et al 2020 primer pairs 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 were used for the amplification of the hypervariable region v3 v4 of the bacterial 16s rrna gene the sequencing platform was the illumina miseq platform and the sequences obtained were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus with 97 similarity wang et al 2020a 2 5 metagenomic sequencing to analyze the metagenomic of anaerobic sludge with or without betaine addition s and sg at high salinity of 9 the extracted dna was fragmented to an average size of about 400 bp using covaris m220 gene company limited china for paired end library construction which was constructed using nextflextm rapid dna seq bioo scientific austin tx usa the related genes were estimated via the cluster of the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genome kegg database which were annotated by diamond http www diamondsearch org index php version 0 8 35 with an e value cutoff of 1e 5 buchfink et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 nb biodegradation and an formation with betaine addition the effect of betaine on nb biodegradation and an formation at high salinity conditions was evaluated fig 1 under anaerobic conditions nb could be reductively transformed into an with nitrosobenzene and hydroxylaminibenzene as the intermediates through an anaerobic reductive process fig s1 lu et al 2021 it could be observed that the nb removal efficiency as well as an formation efficiency were 97 09 2 90 and 79 54 5 03 respectively within 35 h under 0 salinity without betaine addition and a slight promotion of nb reduction and an formation with betaine addition at salinity of 0 was also observed which might be due to the fact that betaine could also act as the carbon and nitrogen source for some certain microorganisms zhu et al 2020 with the increase in salt concentration the nb removal efficiency and an formation efficiency significantly decreased to 36 92 4 02 and 36 07 2 82 at salinity of 9 without betaine addition moreover due to the strong inhibition of salinity on methanogens there was almost no biogas detected in the batch experiments the similar result was reported by xiao et al 2016 which showed a significant decrease in methane production when the salinity increased to 4 however nb removal and an formation increased significantly in the group with betaine addition for instance at salinity of 9 the addition of betaine resulted in nb removal and an formation efficiency of 72 94 6 57 and 65 16 0 33 respectively it should be noted that when the salinity increased from 0 to 6 the efficiencies of nb removal and an formation with betaine addition experienced only a slight decrease from 99 63 3 31 and 83 88 2 59 to 97 78 1 28 and 77 68 2 26 respectively indicating that the addition of betaine could ameliorate the harmful effect of salt stress on nb reduction high osmotic pressure might cause cell dehydration structural damage and enzyme activity inhibition singh 2015 the deterioration of nb biodegradation as well as an formation along with the salinity increasing suggested that the microbial activity and microbial cell structure might have been severely affected gao et al 2019 indicated that the salinity up to 3 5 might cause the failure of nitrification and the microbial activities of nitrite oxidation bacteria nob and ammonia oxidation bacteria aob were severely inhibited nevertheless the addition of betaine might alleviate this inhibition via balancing osmotic pressure and stabilizing cell structure zhao et al 2014 betaine 0 250 mg l 1 was added exogenously to nb degradation medium with 9 salinity to investigate the effect on nb degradation as shown in fig 2 at the beginning of the reaction about 23 h nb was partially removed but there was no an produced it might be that the eps secreted by the cells engulfed nb resulting in a decrease in the concentration of nb instead of being degraded after 30 h the production efficiency of an had been significantly increased and the group added with betaine had an obvious promotion effect actually the an formation efficiency with 0 mg l 1 betaine was 15 01 2 79 at 47 h while it was 72 31 3 63 in the group with 100 mg l 1 betaine added however the efficiency dropped by 6 when the dosage of betaine was 250 mg l 1 hence the optimal dosage of betaine selected in this experiment was 100 mg l 1 this data indicated that only a bit of betaine could achieve a more ideal osmotic pressure relief effect which was consistent with the previous study zuo et al 2021 furthermore betaine might be degraded by fermentation reduction or oxidation reactions to produce dimethylglycine trimethylamine or acetate etc shao et al 2018 as a result part of the betaine would be probably consumed and involved in the nb reduction as the additional electron donor which needs a further investigation 3 2 effects of betaine on microbial metabolism at high salinity 3 2 1 eps secretion eps a complex mixture that is mainly made of polysaccharides ps and proteins pn is considered to secrete in large quantities under unfavorable conditions such as high salt environments gagliano et al 2020 it is believed to increase microbial resistance to toxic substances and maintain cell viability laspidou and rittmann 2002 in the above experiment it was speculated that the addition of betaine under high salt conditions would promote eps secretion therefore the concentration of polysaccharides and proteins in varied types of eps including soluble microbial products smps loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps ren et al 2021 was detected in fig 3 the smps are soluble cellular components secreted by cells which contained large amounts of small negatively charged particles ramesh et al 2006 as illustrated in fig 3a from 0 to 9 salinity smps exhibited a sharp upward trend as whole and it was mainly the contribution of pn the pn content of the control group increased from 98 21 7 42 mg g 1 mlvss to 204 97 13 98 mg g 1 mlvss which showed a two fold increase this might be due to the fact that the high concentration of na weakened the adsorption bridging action within the polymer and resulted in the floc decomposed causing more eps content to be released from the sludge floc into the solution luo et al 2015 moreover compared with the control group the addition of betaine increased the pn concentration at 0 and 9 salinity by 3 38 0 48 mg g 1 mlvss and 50 9 9 96 mg g 1 mlvss respectively previous studies had found that certain functional groups contained in pn could effectively bind to metals hou et al 2020 this result revealed that betaine might be able to achieve the effect of relieving osmolality by promoting pn secretion to bind to positively charged na however as the salinity continued to increase to 12 smps decreased to 135 56 7 02 mg pn g 1 mlvss and 191 22 7 438 mg pn g 1 mlvss without and with betaine addition respectively it was probably due to the microorganism being seriously inhibited which could not secrete more smps under the extremely high salt concentration lb eps is loosely wrapped around the microbial cell protecting itself against the harsh environment yan et al 2016 in the control group the concentration of pn and ps were from 22 67 0 74 mg g 1 mlvss and 1 89 0 44 mg g 1 mlvss to 48 49 0 77 mg g 1 mlvss 6 49 0 48 mg g 1 mlvss with salinity increasing from 0 to 9 respectively fig 3b while as the salinity continued to rise to 12 pn and ps concentrations showed a sharp decline which was 32 46 1 35 mg g 1 mlvss and 5 82 0 30 mg g 1 mlvss respectively this was mainly caused by the shedding of partial lb eps zhao et al 2016 it was also worth noting that the ratio of pn to ps pn ps showed a continuous downward trend with the salinity increasing from 0 to 12 which was consistent with wang et al 2015 a lower pn ps value indicated that the hydroxyl concentration was relatively high which resulted in the destruction of hydrogen bonds in the pn and caused a relatively loose structure of the pn concomitantly more hydrophobic groups were exposed due to the loose protein structure which facilitated the aggregation of sludge wang et al 2020b moreover sem analysis fig s2 also showed that the microbial cell surface was covered with an abundance of floccules after betaine addition at salinity of 9 which could wreathe cells well and protect them from osmotic pressure hu et al 2020 these results revealed that betaine could achieve the purpose of resisting osmotic pressure by compacting pn structure to ensure a tightly bound of the flocs compared with smps and lb eps tb eps played a more important role in the aggregation of sludge liu et al 2010 as illustrated in fig 3c with the salt concentration increasing the total amounts of tb eps showed a deeply downward trend which was from 24 26 0 96 mg g 1 mlvss at 0 salinity to 11 54 1 01 mg g 1 mlvss at 12 salinity in the control group indicating that high salinity made a negative effect on sludge aggregation interestingly compared with the control group the tb eps content after betaine addition increased by 1 71 0 03 mg g 1 mlvss and 2 83 0 11 mg g 1 mlvss under 0 and 12 salinity respectively which indicated that betaine could alleviate flocs destruction caused by osmotic pressure corsino et al 2017 demonstrated that the decrease of pn in tb eps was associated with a reduction in microbial metabolic activity showing that high salt would inhibit the metabolic activity of microorganisms while the addition of betaine could alleviate this inhibitory effect 3 2 2 redox activity oxidation reduction potential orp is an important index that affects the anaerobic metabolic pathways the process of nb anaerobic reduction is based on oxidation reduction reactions in which nb acts as a final electron acceptor therefore anaerobic condition with low redox potential is required for effective nb removal yurtsever et al 2016 the orp values in the anaerobic system with or without betaine under different salinities were presented in fig 4 a with the increase in salt concentration orp values in both anaerobic systems with or without betaine showed upward trends which indicated the inhibition effect of high salinity on anaerobic metabolic activity specifically when the salinity increased from 0 to 9 the orp in the control anaerobic system increased from 190 12 73 mv to 141 20 51 mv while for the anaerobic system with betaine addition the orp only slightly increased from 200 24 75 mv to 185 0 71 mv which showed that the addition of compatible solutes could improve the adaptability of microorganisms to osmotic pressure hu et al 2020 lower orp could create a better reduction environment which was more conducive to the reduction of nb ou et al 2015 to further explore the electron transport performance in the anaerobic system the electron transfer system ets was investigated fig 4b generally the ets activity shrank throughout the increasing salinity stage and the value of the anaerobic system with betaine addition was always higher than that of the control system p 0 05 for instance the maximum value of ets appeared with betaine addition at salinity of 3 was 11596 46 246 μg ml 1 min 1 comparatively the ets activity of the group without betaine was only 6788 77 245 μg ml 1 min 1 showing a decrease of 41 45 these results could demonstrate that the addition of betaine was beneficial to maintaining the stability of enzyme system gioacchino et al 2020 and improved the metabolic activity of the entire system moreover betaine could be used by microorganisms as an intermediate to produce supernumerary electron donors which would enhance the electron transfer rate in key metabolism su et al 2021 3 2 3 key enzymes activities the efficiency of nb anaerobic reduction fundamentally depends on the microbial activity which could be commonly reflected by the corresponding enzyme activities the relative activities of nitroreductases nrs and nad p h which were correlated to nb biotransformation as well as microbial metabolism were illustrated in fig 4c it has been reported that nrs could promote the reduction of nitro groups to hydroxylamines or amines in the presence of electron donors zhou et al 2020 nad p h is an intermediate product of microbial metabolism which can create a reducing environment and facilitate the reduction of nb zee et al 2001 the nrs and nad p h activity in the control anaerobic system at salinity of 0 was set to 100 to make it easy to compare the results the relative activity of nrs and nad p h in the control and betaine added system had no remarkable difference at salinity of 0 p 0 05 indicating that the influence of betaine on the microbial activity was rather weak at salinity of 0 after the salinity was increased to 9 the relative activities of nrs and nad p h observably decreased from 100 0 16 and 100 0 44 at salinity of 0 to 83 32 0 47 and 80 30 2 20 at salinity of 9 respectively however for the anaerobic system with betaine addition the relative activities of nrs and nad p h only slightly decreased to 96 29 1 89 and 96 35 3 34 which indicated that the expression of nrs and synthesis nad p h could be efficiently promoted by betaine under high salinity conditions these results indicated that betaine would be helpful for microorganisms to resist environmental stress and maintain key enzyme activities lu et al 2006 3 3 succession dynamics of the microbial community 16s rrna based illumina high throughput sequencing was employed to detect the abundance and diversity of the microbial community under different salinities as shown in table s1 the diversity of microbial community in s and sg was relatively low as compared to c and g probably due to the inhibition of high salinity it should be noted that much higher shannon index and lower simpson index were observed with betaine addition under 9 salinity which suggested the development of a stable community in sg a four set of venn diagram analysis fig s3a was used to make the distribution of otus under various conditions more visible the sum of otus in the four samples were 937 928 812 and 797 respectively only 32 79 of the otus were found as shared otus which meant that most of the otus disappeared as the salt concentration increased moreover the principal component analysis pca fig s3b revealed that the microbial community structure deviated greatly with the salt concentration increasing from 0 to 9 meanwhile the addition of betaine under high salt conditions 9 salinity would also cause the deviation of the biological community structure in contrast betaine addition almost had no significant effects on the biological community structure with 0 mg l 1 salt concentration the above results indicated that only when high salt and betaine were present at the same time the microbial community structure changed significantly for further comprehensive characterization of the variation of microbial community a taxonomic analysis at levels of phylum and genus had been detected at phylum level fig 5 a most of the bacterial phyla declined under high salinity which belonged to proteobacteria decreased from 11 81 to 4 73 patescibacteria decreased from 6 28 to 1 83 desulfobacterota decreased from 2 34 to 0 09 acidobacteriota decreased from 1 29 to 0 07 these phyla were corresponding to nitrogen removal zhang et al 2021 kristensen et al 2021 anaerobic ammonia oxidation hosokawa et al 2021 and removal of short chain fatty acids scfa hao et al 2020 in the process of wastewater treatment however as salinity raised from 0 to 9 the abundance of firmicutes and halanaerobiaeota increased from 34 69 and 0 to 44 36 and 3 89 respectively in particular the abundance of firmicutes with betaine addition under 9 salinity increased from 44 36 to 50 86 previous studies had shown that firmicutes was positively correlated with the stability of the anaerobic digestion process in high salinity condition briones et al 2014 christman et al 2020 also found firmicutes and halanaerobiaeota in a high salinity oil reservoir more comprehensive differences in microbial functional structure could be achieved at genus level fig 5b more than 25 known genera were detected in s and sg under high salinity condition the relative abundance of the genus trichococcus bacteroidetes vadinha17 tm7a denitratisoma decreased when salinity increased from 0 to 9 trichococcus one facultative anaerobic species that used sugars and organic acids as substrates pikuta et al 2006 was significantly inhibited due to the negative effect of high salinity with a lower abundance of 2 04 s and 0 21 sg compared with that without salinity 23 55 for c and 20 67 for g bacteroidetes vadinha17 was responsible to hydrolyze proteins and amino acids into lactic and propionic acids wang et al 2021 and its richness in c g s sg was 12 70 13 69 10 25 and 9 11 respectively in addition some genera including clostridium sensu stricto 1 bacillus halolactibacillus clostridiisalibacter bacteroides proteiniclasticum thiobacillus aminicenantales increased significantly with the increase in salinity from 0 to 9 for instance clostridium and bacillus played an important role in the production of anaerobic fermentation acids and they could greatly adapt to hyperosmotic condition lloret et al 2013 in addition the abundance of bacillus significantly increased from 6 99 to 12 87 with betaine addition at 9 salinity which was correlated with the finding that betaine could promote gene expression involved in bacillus growth rath et al 2020 similarly the relative abundance of clostridiisalibacter increased from 3 77 for s to 9 22 for sg clostridiisalibacter was found as a moderately halophilic bacterial which could greatly degrade azo dyes by breaking the azo bond into an and benzene under saline alkaline environments guo et al 2020b the enrichment of bacillus and clostridiisalibacter in sg would contribute to the high removal efficiency of nb for the anaerobic system with betaine addition 3 4 functional potential of betaine under high salinity based on metagenomic analysis to explore the potential of betaine in improving the salt tolerance function of microorganisms samples from 9 salinity with or without betaine addition sg s were selected for metagenomic sequencing among these samples about 230 572 unique genes were screened out compared to the group without betaine addition s the relative abundance of the kegg pathways associated with cellular processes genetic information processing human diseases organismal systems showed a significant increase in the betaine addition group gs p 0 05 fig s4 the functional genes encoding key enzymes involved in nb degradation and salt tolerance mechanism were identified and classified according to kegg orthology databases genes involved in salt tolerance like k transport kdpb na transport oada nata and rnf betaine synthesizing and absorbing beta puta opud and prox eps secretion glmm epsp and epsh nb reduction nfsa wrba nnrd and trmfo and electron transfer ccda cobs fixc fcca and menc were significantly affected by betaine under high salinity table 1 at the initial stage of osmotic pressure accumulation the response of cells to balance osmotic pressure was absorbing k from the outside accompanied by the extruding of na hu et al 2020 rath et al 2020 it was found that potassium transporting atpase atp binding subunit encoded by kdpb and oxaloacetate decarboxylase na extruding subunit alpha encoded by oada had a higher expression possibility in sg which were 0 14 vs 0 21 and 0 23 vs 0 32 respectively table 1 kdp is one of the existing k transport systems where kdpb can hydrolyze atp to release energy sato et al 2014 and oad is the first enzyme to feature the na transport decarboxylase family xu et al 2020 thus when cells were stressed by osmotic pressure they firstly absorbed potassium ions through k transporter to balance the extracellular na pressure and the addition of betaine accelerated the speed of potassium uptake and sodium removal as k inside the cell was enriched to a certain level organisms preferred to uptake betaine from the outside through glycine betaine transporter rather than synthesize it via precursor choline here there could be also a weak expression of the enzyme associated with betaine synthesis like choline dehydrogenase encoded by beta and proline dehydrogenase encoded by puta breisch et al 2021 pastor and maloy 1995 and the addition of betaine seemed to enhance this expression 3 45e 03 vs 0 03 0 vs 0 01 moreover the addition of betaine also might stimulate the expression of betaine absorption channel encoded by opud belonging to the betaine choline carnitine transporter bcct family gregory et al 2020 and glycine betaine proline transport system substrate binding protein encoded by prox which increased from 0 15 and 0 04 in s to 0 38 and 0 14 in sg after firstly absorbing synthesizing betaine cell would excrete the k to the outside again whatmore et al 1990 this was a protective mechanism that prevented the formation of high ion concentrations in cells rath et al 2020 however such betaine transporter would also carry na into the cell causing further osmotic stress to overcome such difficulties cells would transport na to the outside through the atp binding cassette abc transporter encoded by nata wei et al 1999 the stabilizing effects of betaine on enzymes was consistent with the enzyme activity measured in fig 4c moreover the salt tolerance strategies mentioned above were accompanied by the secretion of eps phosphoglucomutase encoded by glmm was usually considered as the key enzyme for polysaccharide secretion in bacillus licheniformis chen et al 2016 which played an important role in eps secretion its value rose with betaine addition from 0 02 to 0 18 which was consistent with the results in fig 3 at the same time the gene encoding glycosyltransferase was one of the essential genes associated with extracellular polysaccharide synthesis sun and zhang 2021 and there were many kinds of glycosyltransferases in this study upregulation of gene encoding 3 phosphoshikimate 1 carboxyvinyltransferase encoded by epsp and heptosyltransferase ii encoded by epsh liu et al 2017 haft et al 2006 were monitored these involved genes all showed a significant upward trend in the sg group in addition downregulation of the d lactate dehydrogenase cytochrome gene encoded by dldh was detected in sg according to the current knowledge lactate dehydrogenase ldh was considered as an indicator of damage to cells wan et al 2016 thus betaine protecting cells in a hypertonic environment could be a logical explanation for the downregulation in sg compared with s in anaerobic process nb was first reduced to nitrosobenzene under the catalytic action of nitroreductase nrs encoded by nfsa valiauga et al 2017 and then reduced to hydroxylaminibenzene and an in sequence under the catalysis of nad p h dehydrogenase encoded by wrba compared to s betaine addition resulted in significant upregulation of genes encoding in these enzymes in sg 0 95 vs 1 2 and 1 13 vs 1 32 besides other genes associated with nb degradation like nnrd and trmfo also tended to be upregulated by the addition of betaine cytochrome c acted as a conductive biological component that facilitated extracellular electron transfer eet in which quinones and flavins assisted the eet process as electron shuttles min et al 2021 it was worth noting that the genes associated with electron transport were also higher due to betaine addition which was consistent with fig 4a in detail cytochrome c type biogenesis protein encoded by ccda bushweller 2020 decreased in sg which was 0 61 compared to 0 91 in s other relative genes involved in c type cytochromes and electron shuttles like cobs and menc were all upregulated to varying degrees in the sg group overall the results indicated that microorganisms balanced osmotic pressure by taking up synthesizing compatible solutes which had a considerable positive effect on promoting eps secretion stabilizing enzyme activity and enhancing electron transport efficiency thereby accelerating biodegradation of organic pollutants in high salt environments 3 5 nb biodegradation under long term salinity exposure to investigate the long term effect of betaine addition on microorganisms two uasb reactors were continuously operated for 70 days fig 6 during the initial stage 0 1 5 salinity both r and r system were gradually stabilized exhibiting 100 nb removal efficiency when the salinity was increased to 3 nb removal efficiency and an formation efficiency showed a slight downward trend in r and r system specifically nb removal efficiency and an formation efficiency in r were from 99 01 and 42 95 on day 29 to 84 79 and 30 53 on day 42 respectively which proved that 3 salinity had a slight negative impact on microorganisms it was worth noting that the addition of betaine played a significant positive role on nb reduction when the salinity was over 3 nb removal efficiency and an formation efficiency in r were from 99 19 and 52 26 on day 29 to 96 68 and 44 55 on day 42 respectively it was mainly due to that betaine could quickly balance osmotic pressure to stabilize the anaerobic system however a remarkable reduction of nb removal was observed when the salinity was increased to 6 in r system which was only 64 63 and 14 55 of nb removal efficiency and an formation efficiency on day 70 respectively expectedly the enhancement of nb removal could be facilitated by the addition of betaine on day 70 nb removal efficiency and an formation efficiency was 73 29 and 19 95 in r respectively these results showed that when the salt concentration was low the equilibrium osmotic pressure could be repaired by the microorganisms themselves as the salt concentration gradually increased betaine could play an active role in rapidly balancing the osmotic pressure and maintaining the stability of the reactor he et al 2019 it was worth noting that the mitigating effect of betaine on high salinity stress during long term operation was relatively weaker by comparison with that in the batch experiments which was mainly due to the gradual adaptation of microorganisms to high salinity wang et al 2017 3 6 mechanism for enhanced nb removal with betaine addition at high salinity based on the above research the possible mechanism of betaine addition on promoting anaerobic reduction of nb at high salinity was purposed fig 7 in the anaerobic system for nb degradation when microorganisms were faced with osmotic pressure changes they would first quickly achieve osmotic pressure balance in vivo by absorbing k as well as draining na typical genes like kdpb and oada hou et al 2022 and then synthesized absorbed compatible solutes to continue to balance osmotic pressure typical gene like beta and opud however microorganisms preferred to uptake betaine from the outside through glycine betaine transporter rather than synthesize it via precursor choline by adding betaine it was found that a small amount of betaine could alleviate the negative effects of high salt on nb removal typical genes like nfsa and wrba by stabilizing the cellular structure and providing a desirable reduction environment on the one hand excess na preferred to bind to enzyme proteins and replace the calcium ions song et al 2021 ismail et al 2010 while betaine stimulated the secretion of more eps typical genes like epsp and epsh especially pn by binding to monovalent cations such as na and making the flocs integrate more tightly to compete with hypersaline environments on the other hand betaine would enhance microbial metabolic activity to improve the status of microorganisms in a high salt condition corsino et al 2017 furthermore betaine changed the microbial community and enriched the abundance of anaerobic microbes like firmicutes and bacillus notably some genes related to salt tolerance such as nata prox glmm nnrd ccda cobs and menc were upregulated as well as a consequence effective improvement of nb removal in high salt environments was obtained with a small amount of betaine addition to date the use of compatible solutes like betaine to overcome salinity inhibition in anaerobic process is still in its infancy level the drawback of this strategy is that exogenous addition of compatible solutes would increase the operating cost when treating high salinity organic wastewater with regard to the common strategies for the biological treatment of saline organic wastewater one is the gradual adaptation of biomass to high salinity and the other is the bioaugmentation strategy through using halophilic microbes as the inocula however these above strategies usually need to take a considerable amount of time for the acclimation or incubation of specific microbes moreover in some industries like petroleum textile and leather industries salinity and toxicity might suddenly increase during a short period which could seriously limit the application of common biological treatment method conversely the application of compatible solutes could be a potential strategy to overcome high salinity inhibition on anaerobic process during sudden increase of salinity therefore compatible solutes could be added to anaerobic system to reduce the acclimatization time of anaerobic biomass to salinity vyrides 2015 4 conclusion in this study betaine was added into anaerobic system for the enhancement of nb reduction under hypersaline environments 3 12 salinity betaine addition 100 mg l 1 could effectively promote eps secretion enhance electron transport efficiency and stabilize enzyme activity thereby accelerating biodegradation of nb in high salt environments at genus level some halophilic bacteria like bacillus and clostridiisalibacter were enriched under high salt conditions in addition possible enhancing mechanism for nb degradation with betaine addition at high salinity was also revealed by using metagenomic analysis genes involved in salt tolerance like k na transport betaine synthesizing and absorbing eps secretion as well as nb reduction and electron transfer were upregulated after betaine addition under high salinity furthermore exogenous addition betaine played an important role in maintaining the stability of the anaerobic system with long term salt exposure which would be a potential strategy to achieve high efficiency anaerobic process under high salinity

15602,anaerobic technology is extensively applied in the treatment of industrial organic wastewater but high salinity always triggers microbial cell dehydration causing the failure of the anaerobic process in this work betaine one kind of compatible solutes which could balance the osmotic pressure of anaerobic biomass was exogenously added for enhancing the anaerobic reduction of nitrobenzene nb at high salinity only 100 mg l 1 betaine dosing could significantly promote the removal efficiency of nb within 35 h at 9 salinity 36 92 4 02 without betaine and 72 94 6 57 with betaine the relieving effects on salt stress could be observed in the promotion of more extracellular polymeric substances eps secretion with betaine addition additionally the oxidation reduction potential orp as well as the electron transfer system ets value was increased with betaine addition which was reflected in the improvement of system removal efficiency and enzyme activity microbial community analysis demonstrated that bacillus and clostridiisalibacter which were positively correlated with the stability of the anaerobic process were enriched with betaine addition at high salinity metagenomic analysis speculated that the encoding genes for salt tolerance kdpb oada beta opud epsp epsh and nb degradation nfsa wrba ccda menc obtained higher relative abundance with betaine addition under high salt environment which might be the key to improving salt tolerance of anaerobic biomass the long term assessment demonstrated that exogenous addition betaine played an important role in maintaining the stability of the anaerobic system which would be a potential strategy to achieve a high efficiency anaerobic process under high salinity conditions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords high salinity anaerobic reduction betaine extracellular polymeric substances salt tolerance mechanism data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction during the past few decades industrial activities such as pharmaceuticals textile dyes and pesticides production generated a large amount of industrial wastewater containing a high concentration of organic matter and salts in which salinities ranged from 1 to 20 mao et al 2022 guo et al 2020a in general high salt wastewater refers to the wastewater with a total salt content of more than 1 w v nacl song et al 2021 at present many technologies such as advanced oxidation and ion exchange had been successfully applied to the treatment of high salt wastewater however the high cost and operational complexity had become technical bottlenecks aher et al 2017 biological treatment had been widely used as a cost effective treatment method while anaerobic biological treatment was more conducive to the removal of refractory organic contaminants nonetheless high salt concentration always triggers cell dehydration causing the failure of the anaerobic process bremer and krämer 2019 there are two main strategies for microbes to be subject to osmoregulation one is called the salt in strategy the other is the compatible solute strategy hu et al 2020 with respect to the salt in strategy inorganic ions k and cl are accumulated and then pumped into the cell membrane to help microbes adapt to salt fluctuation sudmalis et al 2018a this process usually requires the participation of enzymes like ribokinase and atpase and more energetically cost bremer and krämer 2019 besides it frequently occurs in extremely halophilic archaea as to compatible solutes strategy it is the most commonly used strategy by microbes to maintain the cell turgor pressure by reducing the osmotic pressure difference between the inside and outside of the cells various types of molecules can be used as compatible solutes like trehalose betaine ectoine and glutamic acid which are considered as highly water soluble organic osmolytes sudmalis et al 2018a most of microbes can synthesize compatible solutes however in extreme environments 1 salinity cells prefer to absorb compatible solutes from the environment rather than synthesize them song et al 2020 exogenous addition of compatible solutes might be a potential strategy to achieve a high efficiency anaerobic process under high salinity conditions among the various kinds of compatible solutes betaine is of considerable industrial importance due to its function of osmotic regulation zhu et al 2020 liu et al 2014 demonstrated that betaine was the most effective compatible solutes among betaine trehalose and ectoine which did great importance in alleviating salt toxicity in anammox process it has been proved that exogenously added betaine could remarkably improve cell growth of rhodococcus sp hx 2 and degradation efficiency of diesel oil at 10 salinity in which the expression of betaine transporter encoding genes h0 h1 h3 h5 and synthesis genes betb would be induced by saline stress hu et al 2020 in addition to balancing the osmotic pressure betaine possessed the ability to protect intracellular enzymes and organelles under saline stress zuo et al 2021 studies also found that betaine would be able to modify gene expression and activity of several enzymes in animals plants and microorganisms because betaine is now known to be involved in a large number of cellular and biochemical processes figueroa soto and valenzuela soto 2018 however the combined effect of saline stress and betaine addition on the anaerobic process for the removal of refractory organic contaminants has yet to be fully elucidated meanwhile previously reported studies merely focused on the performance of pollutant removal but overlooked the microbial metabolism and genetic expression influenced by salinity and betaine in this study betaine was exogenously added to balance the osmotic pressure of anaerobic biomass nitrobenzene nb was chosen as the model pollutant for its wide application and high biotoxicity lu et al 2021 due to the strong electron affinity of the nitro group nb was resistant to biological oxidation therefore nb was usually removed through anaerobic process in which nb could be reductively transformed into less toxic aniline an with organic substances serving as electron donors as the salinity in the general industrial wastewater containing nb usually ranged from 3 to 10 zheng et al 2009 it is essential to investigate the effects of high salinity on the biodegradation of nb the main objectives were as followed 1 exploring the effects of betaine on nb biodegradation and microbial metabolism with betaine addition at high salinity 2 assessing the succession dynamics of the microbial community and functional genes in the presence of betaine at high salinity 3 proposing the possible enhancing mechanism for nb degradation with betaine addition at high salinity 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and inoculation all chemicals used in this study were purchased from aladdin shanghai china including nitrobenzene nb 98 which were all analytically pure the anaerobic sludge used in batch experiments was obtained from a local wastewater treatment plant of a chemical factory liaoyang liaoning province china the anaerobic sludge in the following batch experiments was acclimated to its corresponding salt concentration for 30 days to achieve optimal degradation performance 2 2 experimental design to evaluate the effects of betaine on nb biodegradation at different salinities batch experiments were conducted in 100 ml serum bottles with 1 15 0 05 g volatile suspended solids vss per liter of acclimatized anaerobic sludge the components of the synthetic wastewater were as followed nahco3 1 5 g l 1 kh2po4 0 22 g l 1 mgso4 7h2o 0 05 g l 1 nh4cl 1 02 g l 1 and cacl2 0 05 g l 1 sudmalis et al 2018b and 500 mg l 1 glucose was used as the electron donor according to zhang et al 2019a while the concentration of nb was 100 mg l 1 whereas the control group was the one without betaine addition and the experimental group was the one with 100 mg l 1 betaine addition after being purged into n2 and then sealed with stoppers all the bottles were put into the shaker and ultimately conducted at 35 c 180 rpm the effect of high salinity on nb degradation was investigated with salt concentrations varying from 0 to 12 w v calculated by nacl besides the betaine addition was studied at 0 to 250 mg l 1 when the salinity was maintained at 9 all batch experiments ran for 72 h and all experiments were carried out in triplicates two cylindrical up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors made of plexiglass with an inner diameter of 6 cm a height of 35 cm and an effective volume of about 1 1 l were designed for long term operation the biomass was the same as that used in the batch experiments the hydraulic retention time hrt and operating temperature was maintained at 20 h and 35 1 c respectively the influent salinity was increased gradually as the following levels step by step 0 1 5 3 4 5 and 6 and 100 mg l 1 betaine was continually added during the whole long term operation the composition of synthetic wastewater is the same as the batch test while the content of nb is 400 mg l 1 and the group without betaine addition was r while with 100 mg l 1 betaine addition was r 2 3 analytical methods before analyzing all the water samples were passed through 0 22 μm filter membrane and each measurement was conducted in triplicates nb and aniline an concentrations were measured by using high performance liquid chromatography hplc waters 2695 america according to zhang et al 2019b the method for hplc ms was depicted in the text s1 the calculation formula for nb removal efficiency and an formation efficiency was described in text s2 the morphology of anaerobic sludge under different salt concentrations was observed by a cold field emission scanning electron microscopy sem s 4800 ii fesem hitachi japan for batch experiment sludge samples with without 100 mg l 1 betaine addition at 0 and 9 salinity were collected after 35 h inoculation for ets eps orp and relative enzyme activity characterizations the uv visible spectrophotometer uv vis lambda 25 perkinelmer america and orp measuring instrument orp fe20k mettle switzerland were used to detect electron transport system ets and oxidation reduction potential orp respectively the extracellular polymeric substances eps extraction was according to su et al 2019 and the components of eps including protein pn as well as polysaccharides ps were measured by uv vis according to zhang et al 2017 the enzyme activities of nitroreductases nrs and nad p h were detected by jlc a701 48t and jlca880 48t shanghai jingkang biology engineering co ltd respectively 2 4 dna extraction and high throughput sequencing the microbial community structure in the anaerobic sludge at different salinities with or without betaine addition after a multi cycle operation for 30 days was analyzed through high throughput sequencing four sludge samples were collected for dna extraction whose sample names were as followed 0 salinity c 0 salinity with betaine addition g 9 salinity s 9 salinity with betaine addition sg the methods of genomic dna extraction and pcr amplification were according to shi et al 2020 primer pairs 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 were used for the amplification of the hypervariable region v3 v4 of the bacterial 16s rrna gene the sequencing platform was the illumina miseq platform and the sequences obtained were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus with 97 similarity wang et al 2020a 2 5 metagenomic sequencing to analyze the metagenomic of anaerobic sludge with or without betaine addition s and sg at high salinity of 9 the extracted dna was fragmented to an average size of about 400 bp using covaris m220 gene company limited china for paired end library construction which was constructed using nextflextm rapid dna seq bioo scientific austin tx usa the related genes were estimated via the cluster of the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genome kegg database which were annotated by diamond http www diamondsearch org index php version 0 8 35 with an e value cutoff of 1e 5 buchfink et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 nb biodegradation and an formation with betaine addition the effect of betaine on nb biodegradation and an formation at high salinity conditions was evaluated fig 1 under anaerobic conditions nb could be reductively transformed into an with nitrosobenzene and hydroxylaminibenzene as the intermediates through an anaerobic reductive process fig s1 lu et al 2021 it could be observed that the nb removal efficiency as well as an formation efficiency were 97 09 2 90 and 79 54 5 03 respectively within 35 h under 0 salinity without betaine addition and a slight promotion of nb reduction and an formation with betaine addition at salinity of 0 was also observed which might be due to the fact that betaine could also act as the carbon and nitrogen source for some certain microorganisms zhu et al 2020 with the increase in salt concentration the nb removal efficiency and an formation efficiency significantly decreased to 36 92 4 02 and 36 07 2 82 at salinity of 9 without betaine addition moreover due to the strong inhibition of salinity on methanogens there was almost no biogas detected in the batch experiments the similar result was reported by xiao et al 2016 which showed a significant decrease in methane production when the salinity increased to 4 however nb removal and an formation increased significantly in the group with betaine addition for instance at salinity of 9 the addition of betaine resulted in nb removal and an formation efficiency of 72 94 6 57 and 65 16 0 33 respectively it should be noted that when the salinity increased from 0 to 6 the efficiencies of nb removal and an formation with betaine addition experienced only a slight decrease from 99 63 3 31 and 83 88 2 59 to 97 78 1 28 and 77 68 2 26 respectively indicating that the addition of betaine could ameliorate the harmful effect of salt stress on nb reduction high osmotic pressure might cause cell dehydration structural damage and enzyme activity inhibition singh 2015 the deterioration of nb biodegradation as well as an formation along with the salinity increasing suggested that the microbial activity and microbial cell structure might have been severely affected gao et al 2019 indicated that the salinity up to 3 5 might cause the failure of nitrification and the microbial activities of nitrite oxidation bacteria nob and ammonia oxidation bacteria aob were severely inhibited nevertheless the addition of betaine might alleviate this inhibition via balancing osmotic pressure and stabilizing cell structure zhao et al 2014 betaine 0 250 mg l 1 was added exogenously to nb degradation medium with 9 salinity to investigate the effect on nb degradation as shown in fig 2 at the beginning of the reaction about 23 h nb was partially removed but there was no an produced it might be that the eps secreted by the cells engulfed nb resulting in a decrease in the concentration of nb instead of being degraded after 30 h the production efficiency of an had been significantly increased and the group added with betaine had an obvious promotion effect actually the an formation efficiency with 0 mg l 1 betaine was 15 01 2 79 at 47 h while it was 72 31 3 63 in the group with 100 mg l 1 betaine added however the efficiency dropped by 6 when the dosage of betaine was 250 mg l 1 hence the optimal dosage of betaine selected in this experiment was 100 mg l 1 this data indicated that only a bit of betaine could achieve a more ideal osmotic pressure relief effect which was consistent with the previous study zuo et al 2021 furthermore betaine might be degraded by fermentation reduction or oxidation reactions to produce dimethylglycine trimethylamine or acetate etc shao et al 2018 as a result part of the betaine would be probably consumed and involved in the nb reduction as the additional electron donor which needs a further investigation 3 2 effects of betaine on microbial metabolism at high salinity 3 2 1 eps secretion eps a complex mixture that is mainly made of polysaccharides ps and proteins pn is considered to secrete in large quantities under unfavorable conditions such as high salt environments gagliano et al 2020 it is believed to increase microbial resistance to toxic substances and maintain cell viability laspidou and rittmann 2002 in the above experiment it was speculated that the addition of betaine under high salt conditions would promote eps secretion therefore the concentration of polysaccharides and proteins in varied types of eps including soluble microbial products smps loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps ren et al 2021 was detected in fig 3 the smps are soluble cellular components secreted by cells which contained large amounts of small negatively charged particles ramesh et al 2006 as illustrated in fig 3a from 0 to 9 salinity smps exhibited a sharp upward trend as whole and it was mainly the contribution of pn the pn content of the control group increased from 98 21 7 42 mg g 1 mlvss to 204 97 13 98 mg g 1 mlvss which showed a two fold increase this might be due to the fact that the high concentration of na weakened the adsorption bridging action within the polymer and resulted in the floc decomposed causing more eps content to be released from the sludge floc into the solution luo et al 2015 moreover compared with the control group the addition of betaine increased the pn concentration at 0 and 9 salinity by 3 38 0 48 mg g 1 mlvss and 50 9 9 96 mg g 1 mlvss respectively previous studies had found that certain functional groups contained in pn could effectively bind to metals hou et al 2020 this result revealed that betaine might be able to achieve the effect of relieving osmolality by promoting pn secretion to bind to positively charged na however as the salinity continued to increase to 12 smps decreased to 135 56 7 02 mg pn g 1 mlvss and 191 22 7 438 mg pn g 1 mlvss without and with betaine addition respectively it was probably due to the microorganism being seriously inhibited which could not secrete more smps under the extremely high salt concentration lb eps is loosely wrapped around the microbial cell protecting itself against the harsh environment yan et al 2016 in the control group the concentration of pn and ps were from 22 67 0 74 mg g 1 mlvss and 1 89 0 44 mg g 1 mlvss to 48 49 0 77 mg g 1 mlvss 6 49 0 48 mg g 1 mlvss with salinity increasing from 0 to 9 respectively fig 3b while as the salinity continued to rise to 12 pn and ps concentrations showed a sharp decline which was 32 46 1 35 mg g 1 mlvss and 5 82 0 30 mg g 1 mlvss respectively this was mainly caused by the shedding of partial lb eps zhao et al 2016 it was also worth noting that the ratio of pn to ps pn ps showed a continuous downward trend with the salinity increasing from 0 to 12 which was consistent with wang et al 2015 a lower pn ps value indicated that the hydroxyl concentration was relatively high which resulted in the destruction of hydrogen bonds in the pn and caused a relatively loose structure of the pn concomitantly more hydrophobic groups were exposed due to the loose protein structure which facilitated the aggregation of sludge wang et al 2020b moreover sem analysis fig s2 also showed that the microbial cell surface was covered with an abundance of floccules after betaine addition at salinity of 9 which could wreathe cells well and protect them from osmotic pressure hu et al 2020 these results revealed that betaine could achieve the purpose of resisting osmotic pressure by compacting pn structure to ensure a tightly bound of the flocs compared with smps and lb eps tb eps played a more important role in the aggregation of sludge liu et al 2010 as illustrated in fig 3c with the salt concentration increasing the total amounts of tb eps showed a deeply downward trend which was from 24 26 0 96 mg g 1 mlvss at 0 salinity to 11 54 1 01 mg g 1 mlvss at 12 salinity in the control group indicating that high salinity made a negative effect on sludge aggregation interestingly compared with the control group the tb eps content after betaine addition increased by 1 71 0 03 mg g 1 mlvss and 2 83 0 11 mg g 1 mlvss under 0 and 12 salinity respectively which indicated that betaine could alleviate flocs destruction caused by osmotic pressure corsino et al 2017 demonstrated that the decrease of pn in tb eps was associated with a reduction in microbial metabolic activity showing that high salt would inhibit the metabolic activity of microorganisms while the addition of betaine could alleviate this inhibitory effect 3 2 2 redox activity oxidation reduction potential orp is an important index that affects the anaerobic metabolic pathways the process of nb anaerobic reduction is based on oxidation reduction reactions in which nb acts as a final electron acceptor therefore anaerobic condition with low redox potential is required for effective nb removal yurtsever et al 2016 the orp values in the anaerobic system with or without betaine under different salinities were presented in fig 4 a with the increase in salt concentration orp values in both anaerobic systems with or without betaine showed upward trends which indicated the inhibition effect of high salinity on anaerobic metabolic activity specifically when the salinity increased from 0 to 9 the orp in the control anaerobic system increased from 190 12 73 mv to 141 20 51 mv while for the anaerobic system with betaine addition the orp only slightly increased from 200 24 75 mv to 185 0 71 mv which showed that the addition of compatible solutes could improve the adaptability of microorganisms to osmotic pressure hu et al 2020 lower orp could create a better reduction environment which was more conducive to the reduction of nb ou et al 2015 to further explore the electron transport performance in the anaerobic system the electron transfer system ets was investigated fig 4b generally the ets activity shrank throughout the increasing salinity stage and the value of the anaerobic system with betaine addition was always higher than that of the control system p 0 05 for instance the maximum value of ets appeared with betaine addition at salinity of 3 was 11596 46 246 μg ml 1 min 1 comparatively the ets activity of the group without betaine was only 6788 77 245 μg ml 1 min 1 showing a decrease of 41 45 these results could demonstrate that the addition of betaine was beneficial to maintaining the stability of enzyme system gioacchino et al 2020 and improved the metabolic activity of the entire system moreover betaine could be used by microorganisms as an intermediate to produce supernumerary electron donors which would enhance the electron transfer rate in key metabolism su et al 2021 3 2 3 key enzymes activities the efficiency of nb anaerobic reduction fundamentally depends on the microbial activity which could be commonly reflected by the corresponding enzyme activities the relative activities of nitroreductases nrs and nad p h which were correlated to nb biotransformation as well as microbial metabolism were illustrated in fig 4c it has been reported that nrs could promote the reduction of nitro groups to hydroxylamines or amines in the presence of electron donors zhou et al 2020 nad p h is an intermediate product of microbial metabolism which can create a reducing environment and facilitate the reduction of nb zee et al 2001 the nrs and nad p h activity in the control anaerobic system at salinity of 0 was set to 100 to make it easy to compare the results the relative activity of nrs and nad p h in the control and betaine added system had no remarkable difference at salinity of 0 p 0 05 indicating that the influence of betaine on the microbial activity was rather weak at salinity of 0 after the salinity was increased to 9 the relative activities of nrs and nad p h observably decreased from 100 0 16 and 100 0 44 at salinity of 0 to 83 32 0 47 and 80 30 2 20 at salinity of 9 respectively however for the anaerobic system with betaine addition the relative activities of nrs and nad p h only slightly decreased to 96 29 1 89 and 96 35 3 34 which indicated that the expression of nrs and synthesis nad p h could be efficiently promoted by betaine under high salinity conditions these results indicated that betaine would be helpful for microorganisms to resist environmental stress and maintain key enzyme activities lu et al 2006 3 3 succession dynamics of the microbial community 16s rrna based illumina high throughput sequencing was employed to detect the abundance and diversity of the microbial community under different salinities as shown in table s1 the diversity of microbial community in s and sg was relatively low as compared to c and g probably due to the inhibition of high salinity it should be noted that much higher shannon index and lower simpson index were observed with betaine addition under 9 salinity which suggested the development of a stable community in sg a four set of venn diagram analysis fig s3a was used to make the distribution of otus under various conditions more visible the sum of otus in the four samples were 937 928 812 and 797 respectively only 32 79 of the otus were found as shared otus which meant that most of the otus disappeared as the salt concentration increased moreover the principal component analysis pca fig s3b revealed that the microbial community structure deviated greatly with the salt concentration increasing from 0 to 9 meanwhile the addition of betaine under high salt conditions 9 salinity would also cause the deviation of the biological community structure in contrast betaine addition almost had no significant effects on the biological community structure with 0 mg l 1 salt concentration the above results indicated that only when high salt and betaine were present at the same time the microbial community structure changed significantly for further comprehensive characterization of the variation of microbial community a taxonomic analysis at levels of phylum and genus had been detected at phylum level fig 5 a most of the bacterial phyla declined under high salinity which belonged to proteobacteria decreased from 11 81 to 4 73 patescibacteria decreased from 6 28 to 1 83 desulfobacterota decreased from 2 34 to 0 09 acidobacteriota decreased from 1 29 to 0 07 these phyla were corresponding to nitrogen removal zhang et al 2021 kristensen et al 2021 anaerobic ammonia oxidation hosokawa et al 2021 and removal of short chain fatty acids scfa hao et al 2020 in the process of wastewater treatment however as salinity raised from 0 to 9 the abundance of firmicutes and halanaerobiaeota increased from 34 69 and 0 to 44 36 and 3 89 respectively in particular the abundance of firmicutes with betaine addition under 9 salinity increased from 44 36 to 50 86 previous studies had shown that firmicutes was positively correlated with the stability of the anaerobic digestion process in high salinity condition briones et al 2014 christman et al 2020 also found firmicutes and halanaerobiaeota in a high salinity oil reservoir more comprehensive differences in microbial functional structure could be achieved at genus level fig 5b more than 25 known genera were detected in s and sg under high salinity condition the relative abundance of the genus trichococcus bacteroidetes vadinha17 tm7a denitratisoma decreased when salinity increased from 0 to 9 trichococcus one facultative anaerobic species that used sugars and organic acids as substrates pikuta et al 2006 was significantly inhibited due to the negative effect of high salinity with a lower abundance of 2 04 s and 0 21 sg compared with that without salinity 23 55 for c and 20 67 for g bacteroidetes vadinha17 was responsible to hydrolyze proteins and amino acids into lactic and propionic acids wang et al 2021 and its richness in c g s sg was 12 70 13 69 10 25 and 9 11 respectively in addition some genera including clostridium sensu stricto 1 bacillus halolactibacillus clostridiisalibacter bacteroides proteiniclasticum thiobacillus aminicenantales increased significantly with the increase in salinity from 0 to 9 for instance clostridium and bacillus played an important role in the production of anaerobic fermentation acids and they could greatly adapt to hyperosmotic condition lloret et al 2013 in addition the abundance of bacillus significantly increased from 6 99 to 12 87 with betaine addition at 9 salinity which was correlated with the finding that betaine could promote gene expression involved in bacillus growth rath et al 2020 similarly the relative abundance of clostridiisalibacter increased from 3 77 for s to 9 22 for sg clostridiisalibacter was found as a moderately halophilic bacterial which could greatly degrade azo dyes by breaking the azo bond into an and benzene under saline alkaline environments guo et al 2020b the enrichment of bacillus and clostridiisalibacter in sg would contribute to the high removal efficiency of nb for the anaerobic system with betaine addition 3 4 functional potential of betaine under high salinity based on metagenomic analysis to explore the potential of betaine in improving the salt tolerance function of microorganisms samples from 9 salinity with or without betaine addition sg s were selected for metagenomic sequencing among these samples about 230 572 unique genes were screened out compared to the group without betaine addition s the relative abundance of the kegg pathways associated with cellular processes genetic information processing human diseases organismal systems showed a significant increase in the betaine addition group gs p 0 05 fig s4 the functional genes encoding key enzymes involved in nb degradation and salt tolerance mechanism were identified and classified according to kegg orthology databases genes involved in salt tolerance like k transport kdpb na transport oada nata and rnf betaine synthesizing and absorbing beta puta opud and prox eps secretion glmm epsp and epsh nb reduction nfsa wrba nnrd and trmfo and electron transfer ccda cobs fixc fcca and menc were significantly affected by betaine under high salinity table 1 at the initial stage of osmotic pressure accumulation the response of cells to balance osmotic pressure was absorbing k from the outside accompanied by the extruding of na hu et al 2020 rath et al 2020 it was found that potassium transporting atpase atp binding subunit encoded by kdpb and oxaloacetate decarboxylase na extruding subunit alpha encoded by oada had a higher expression possibility in sg which were 0 14 vs 0 21 and 0 23 vs 0 32 respectively table 1 kdp is one of the existing k transport systems where kdpb can hydrolyze atp to release energy sato et al 2014 and oad is the first enzyme to feature the na transport decarboxylase family xu et al 2020 thus when cells were stressed by osmotic pressure they firstly absorbed potassium ions through k transporter to balance the extracellular na pressure and the addition of betaine accelerated the speed of potassium uptake and sodium removal as k inside the cell was enriched to a certain level organisms preferred to uptake betaine from the outside through glycine betaine transporter rather than synthesize it via precursor choline here there could be also a weak expression of the enzyme associated with betaine synthesis like choline dehydrogenase encoded by beta and proline dehydrogenase encoded by puta breisch et al 2021 pastor and maloy 1995 and the addition of betaine seemed to enhance this expression 3 45e 03 vs 0 03 0 vs 0 01 moreover the addition of betaine also might stimulate the expression of betaine absorption channel encoded by opud belonging to the betaine choline carnitine transporter bcct family gregory et al 2020 and glycine betaine proline transport system substrate binding protein encoded by prox which increased from 0 15 and 0 04 in s to 0 38 and 0 14 in sg after firstly absorbing synthesizing betaine cell would excrete the k to the outside again whatmore et al 1990 this was a protective mechanism that prevented the formation of high ion concentrations in cells rath et al 2020 however such betaine transporter would also carry na into the cell causing further osmotic stress to overcome such difficulties cells would transport na to the outside through the atp binding cassette abc transporter encoded by nata wei et al 1999 the stabilizing effects of betaine on enzymes was consistent with the enzyme activity measured in fig 4c moreover the salt tolerance strategies mentioned above were accompanied by the secretion of eps phosphoglucomutase encoded by glmm was usually considered as the key enzyme for polysaccharide secretion in bacillus licheniformis chen et al 2016 which played an important role in eps secretion its value rose with betaine addition from 0 02 to 0 18 which was consistent with the results in fig 3 at the same time the gene encoding glycosyltransferase was one of the essential genes associated with extracellular polysaccharide synthesis sun and zhang 2021 and there were many kinds of glycosyltransferases in this study upregulation of gene encoding 3 phosphoshikimate 1 carboxyvinyltransferase encoded by epsp and heptosyltransferase ii encoded by epsh liu et al 2017 haft et al 2006 were monitored these involved genes all showed a significant upward trend in the sg group in addition downregulation of the d lactate dehydrogenase cytochrome gene encoded by dldh was detected in sg according to the current knowledge lactate dehydrogenase ldh was considered as an indicator of damage to cells wan et al 2016 thus betaine protecting cells in a hypertonic environment could be a logical explanation for the downregulation in sg compared with s in anaerobic process nb was first reduced to nitrosobenzene under the catalytic action of nitroreductase nrs encoded by nfsa valiauga et al 2017 and then reduced to hydroxylaminibenzene and an in sequence under the catalysis of nad p h dehydrogenase encoded by wrba compared to s betaine addition resulted in significant upregulation of genes encoding in these enzymes in sg 0 95 vs 1 2 and 1 13 vs 1 32 besides other genes associated with nb degradation like nnrd and trmfo also tended to be upregulated by the addition of betaine cytochrome c acted as a conductive biological component that facilitated extracellular electron transfer eet in which quinones and flavins assisted the eet process as electron shuttles min et al 2021 it was worth noting that the genes associated with electron transport were also higher due to betaine addition which was consistent with fig 4a in detail cytochrome c type biogenesis protein encoded by ccda bushweller 2020 decreased in sg which was 0 61 compared to 0 91 in s other relative genes involved in c type cytochromes and electron shuttles like cobs and menc were all upregulated to varying degrees in the sg group overall the results indicated that microorganisms balanced osmotic pressure by taking up synthesizing compatible solutes which had a considerable positive effect on promoting eps secretion stabilizing enzyme activity and enhancing electron transport efficiency thereby accelerating biodegradation of organic pollutants in high salt environments 3 5 nb biodegradation under long term salinity exposure to investigate the long term effect of betaine addition on microorganisms two uasb reactors were continuously operated for 70 days fig 6 during the initial stage 0 1 5 salinity both r and r system were gradually stabilized exhibiting 100 nb removal efficiency when the salinity was increased to 3 nb removal efficiency and an formation efficiency showed a slight downward trend in r and r system specifically nb removal efficiency and an formation efficiency in r were from 99 01 and 42 95 on day 29 to 84 79 and 30 53 on day 42 respectively which proved that 3 salinity had a slight negative impact on microorganisms it was worth noting that the addition of betaine played a significant positive role on nb reduction when the salinity was over 3 nb removal efficiency and an formation efficiency in r were from 99 19 and 52 26 on day 29 to 96 68 and 44 55 on day 42 respectively it was mainly due to that betaine could quickly balance osmotic pressure to stabilize the anaerobic system however a remarkable reduction of nb removal was observed when the salinity was increased to 6 in r system which was only 64 63 and 14 55 of nb removal efficiency and an formation efficiency on day 70 respectively expectedly the enhancement of nb removal could be facilitated by the addition of betaine on day 70 nb removal efficiency and an formation efficiency was 73 29 and 19 95 in r respectively these results showed that when the salt concentration was low the equilibrium osmotic pressure could be repaired by the microorganisms themselves as the salt concentration gradually increased betaine could play an active role in rapidly balancing the osmotic pressure and maintaining the stability of the reactor he et al 2019 it was worth noting that the mitigating effect of betaine on high salinity stress during long term operation was relatively weaker by comparison with that in the batch experiments which was mainly due to the gradual adaptation of microorganisms to high salinity wang et al 2017 3 6 mechanism for enhanced nb removal with betaine addition at high salinity based on the above research the possible mechanism of betaine addition on promoting anaerobic reduction of nb at high salinity was purposed fig 7 in the anaerobic system for nb degradation when microorganisms were faced with osmotic pressure changes they would first quickly achieve osmotic pressure balance in vivo by absorbing k as well as draining na typical genes like kdpb and oada hou et al 2022 and then synthesized absorbed compatible solutes to continue to balance osmotic pressure typical gene like beta and opud however microorganisms preferred to uptake betaine from the outside through glycine betaine transporter rather than synthesize it via precursor choline by adding betaine it was found that a small amount of betaine could alleviate the negative effects of high salt on nb removal typical genes like nfsa and wrba by stabilizing the cellular structure and providing a desirable reduction environment on the one hand excess na preferred to bind to enzyme proteins and replace the calcium ions song et al 2021 ismail et al 2010 while betaine stimulated the secretion of more eps typical genes like epsp and epsh especially pn by binding to monovalent cations such as na and making the flocs integrate more tightly to compete with hypersaline environments on the other hand betaine would enhance microbial metabolic activity to improve the status of microorganisms in a high salt condition corsino et al 2017 furthermore betaine changed the microbial community and enriched the abundance of anaerobic microbes like firmicutes and bacillus notably some genes related to salt tolerance such as nata prox glmm nnrd ccda cobs and menc were upregulated as well as a consequence effective improvement of nb removal in high salt environments was obtained with a small amount of betaine addition to date the use of compatible solutes like betaine to overcome salinity inhibition in anaerobic process is still in its infancy level the drawback of this strategy is that exogenous addition of compatible solutes would increase the operating cost when treating high salinity organic wastewater with regard to the common strategies for the biological treatment of saline organic wastewater one is the gradual adaptation of biomass to high salinity and the other is the bioaugmentation strategy through using halophilic microbes as the inocula however these above strategies usually need to take a considerable amount of time for the acclimation or incubation of specific microbes moreover in some industries like petroleum textile and leather industries salinity and toxicity might suddenly increase during a short period which could seriously limit the application of common biological treatment method conversely the application of compatible solutes could be a potential strategy to overcome high salinity inhibition on anaerobic process during sudden increase of salinity therefore compatible solutes could be added to anaerobic system to reduce the acclimatization time of anaerobic biomass to salinity vyrides 2015 4 conclusion in this study betaine was added into anaerobic system for the enhancement of nb reduction under hypersaline environments 3 12 salinity betaine addition 100 mg l 1 could effectively promote eps secretion enhance electron transport efficiency and stabilize enzyme activity thereby accelerating biodegradation of nb in high salt environments at genus level some halophilic bacteria like bacillus and clostridiisalibacter were enriched under high salt conditions in addition possible enhancing mechanism for nb degradation with betaine addition at high salinity was also revealed by using metagenomic analysis genes involved in salt tolerance like k na transport betaine synthesizing and absorbing eps secretion as well as nb reduction and electron transfer were upregulated after betaine addition under high salinity furthermore exogenous addition betaine played an important role in maintaining the stability of the anaerobic system with long term salt exposure which would be a potential strategy to achieve high efficiency anaerobic process under high salinity

15603,due to the covid 19 pandemic the worldwide biocides application has been increased which will eventually result in enhanced residuals in treated wastewater at the same time chlorine disinfection of secondary effluents and hospital wastewaters has been intensified with respect to predicted elevated exposure in wastewater the chlorination kinetics transformation pathways and toxicity evolution were investigated in this study for two typical isothiazolinone biocides methyl isothiazolinone mit and chloro methyl isothiazolinone cmit second order rate constants of 0 13 m 1 s 1 1 95 105 m 1 s 1 and 5 14 105 m 1 s 1 were determined for the reaction of mit with hocl cl2o and cl2 respectively while reactivity of cmit was around 1 2 orders of magnitude lower while chlorination of isothiazolinone biocides at ph 7 1 was dominated by cl2o oxidation acidic ph and elevated cl concentration favored free active chlorine fac speciation into cl2 and increased overall isothiazolinone removal regardless of the dominant fac species the elimination of mit and cmit resulted in an immediate loss of acute toxicity under all experimental conditions which was attributed to a preferential attack at the s atom resulting in subsequent formation of sulfoxides and sulfones and eventually an s elimination however chlorination of isothiazolinone biocides in secondary effluent only achieved 10 elimination at typical disinfection chlorine exposure 200 mg l 1 min but was predicted to be remarkably increased by acidizing solution to ph 5 5 alternative measures might be needed to minimize the discharge of

households hora et al 2020 lee et al 2021 thereafter inducing elevated contaminant concentration and related risks during epidemics also chlorination may become more important to prevent the

eliminate numerous organic compounds e g phenols estradiol and pesticides hu et al 2003 deborde et al 2008 de barros et al 2021 xu et al 2021 in circumneutral solution hocl and ocl are the dominant fac species fig s1 among which hocl dominantly responses to pathogen inactivation because it can much more rapidly react with peptides and proteins in microorganisms albrich et al 1981 sivey et al 2013 lu et al 2022 hocl was also reported as most relevant species for the transformation of recalcitrant organic pollutants such as prometryn sotalol and antipyrine cai et al 2013 khalit et al 2017 hu et al 2021b the reactivity of isothiazolinone biocides with hocl and ocl has not been previously reported with varying solution ph and cl concentration however fac also speciates into other

studies highlighted the important roles of cl2o and cl2 for the transformation of heterocyclic nitrogen compounds cai et al 2013 phenols lau et al 2016 and cyclic alkenes lau et al 2019 contribution of cl2 can be most relevant at elevated cl concentrations in acidic solution cherney et al 2006 it was clearly illustrated as the main contributor to the transformation of recalcitrant amide containing compounds with the reactivity being 4 5 orders of magnitude higher than for hocl dodd et al 2007 though cl2o shows lower redox potential 0 80 v than hocl 1 50 v and cl2 1 40 v crittenden et al 2012 sivey et al observed that it was 6 and 7 orders of magnitude more reactive to dimethenamid and aromatic esters sivey et al 2010 sivey et al 2012 the considerably faster reaction of cl2o to some organic chemicals compared to hocl may relate to the distinct reaction patterns as implied by the correlations between reactivity constant and hammett constant lau et al 2016 it was proposed that reactions of cl2o can result in the formation of organic radicals and secondary reactive chlorine species cl and clo renard et al 1976 isothiaozolinone biocides contain a n and s heterocyclic ring and have not been investigated for their reactivities with cl2 and cl2o in different water matrices e g ph chlorides and dissolved organic matter in addition to the chlorination kinetics the preferential reactive sites chlorination products and effects of chlorination on toxicity are also unknown for isothiaozolinone biocides as the more intensive application of biocides coincides with more stringent requirements for chlorination in some countries research is needed to determine the kinetics for the reaction of isothiazolinone compounds with fac quantify contribution of individual fac species and identify representative chlorination pathways this study aims to assess the chlorination kinetics of representative isothiazolinone biocides mit and cmit in various matrix backgrounds ph chloride and real secondary effluent including the reactivities and contributions of individual fac species and the transformation pathway since the evolution of biological activity e g estrogenic activity and acute toxicity of target pollutants is a serious concern for chlorination hu et al 2003 huang et al 2020 and might be affected by the different reaction mechanisms of most dominant fac species gao et al 2018 prasse et al 2020 we further investigated the effect of chlorination in different water matrices on acute toxicity of isothiazolinone compounds and transformation products tps 2 materials and experiments 2 1 chemicals and materials selected isothiazolinone biocides mit 98 purity and cmit 98 purity naocl solution with a mass ratio of 10 and methanol with hplc grade were purchased from j k scientific ltd beijing china secondary effluent was collected from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp in beijing and filtered by 0 45 µm for chlorination experiments the general water quality parameters of the secondary effluent are listed in table s1 ultrapure water was produced by the millipore milli q integral 5 water purification system merck germany 2 2 chlorination experiments an fac stock solution 2 g l 1 cl2 equivalent was prepared by diluting the 10 naocl solution the chlorination experiments were conducted by spiking specific volumes of fac stock into mit 15 2 µm or cmit 8 4 µm solutions buffered by 10 mm nah2po4 2h2o resulting in initial fac doses fac 0 of 0 2 3 7 mm the applied molar concentration of fac 0 was ten times higher than biocide concentration and thus assumed as constant during the chlorination to evaluate the adsorbable organic chlorine aocl during chlorination the concentrations of both biocides and chlorines was increased by ten times for chlorination experiments the solution ph was adjusted to 5 4 8 5 with naoh 5 m the exact fac at the beginning of the experiment was measured by the colorimetric method with dpd reagent on a photometer hi93711 hanna usa aliquots were sampled after specific reaction times and residual fac was quenched by na2s2o3 for analyses of biocides and adsorbable organic chloride aocl identification of transformation products tps and luminescent bacteria toxicity measurement the chlorination experiments were also conducted under various conditions of varying added chloride cl added solution ph values and secondary effluent of wwtp 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 biocide concentration the mit and cmit concentrations were determined by a shimadzu hplc lc20at kyoto japan with a photo diode array detector spd20 kyoto

total and extracted ions mass to charge m z and the mass spectra were analyzed with the xcalibur software 2 3 3 toxicity evaluation the acute toxicity of mit and cmit before and after chlorination was assessed by the luminesce inhibition to photobacterium phosphoreum t3 the luminesce inhibition was measured at various dilution times for each sample and acute toxicity was quantitatively expressed as the dilution times that induced 20 ld 20 and 50 ld 50 of luminesce inhibitions for mit and cmit respectively the ld 20 was selected for mit because the luminesce inhibition by mit was relatively low especially after chlorination in comparison to luminesce inhibition which depends on the range of the toxicity dose response ld 50 or ld 20 can provide a valid toxicity assessment at any biocide concentration the details of the toxicity evaluation are described in text s2 2 3 4 adsorbable organic chloride aocl the aocl were measured using a multi x 2500 aox analyzer analytik jena germany after adsorption onto an activated carbon column and washing by sodium nitrate to remove inorganic chloride the activated carbon was burned in oxygen and the generated hcl was adsorbed by 14 ml water chloride in the final solution was determined by the micro coulomb titration method 3 results and discussion 3 1 chlorination kinetics 3 1 1 influence of fac dose the chlorination of mit and cmit followed pseudo first order kinetics fig s2 and eq 4 because the fac concentration was at least one order of magnitude higher than biocides and was almost constant during the reaction thus the reaction order was determined as 1 in biocides to verify the fac related reaction order n the chlorination kinetics of mit and cmit were evaluated at various fac doses at ph 6 6 and 7 1 the observed kinetic constants k obs of mit and cmit obviously increased with increasing fac dose at ph 6 6 and ph 7 1 fig 1 a the increase of k obs however did not linearly correlate with fac dose indicating that the reaction does not follow second order kinetics and the order n relative to fac is higher than 1 by plotting the logarithmic curves between k obs and fac doses following eq 5 the values of fac related reaction order n at ph 7 1 were fitted as 1 76 0 05 and 1 91 0 07 for mit and cmit respectively fig 1 b in comparison to hocl cl2o and cl2 ocl is much less reactive to organic pollutants gallard et al 2002 choe et al 2021 in this study the k obs at ph 7 1 was already considerably lower than at ph 6 6 which confirmed the much lower reactivity of ocl to isothiazolinone biocides thus hocl cl2o and cl2 were proposed as the main facs contributing to the degradation of biocides eq s13 s15 and ocl neglected for the degradation kinetics described in eq 5 considering the speciation of fac in eq 2 3 the cl2o and cl2 in eq 5 can be expressed as a function of hocl text s1 eq 6 4 d p d t k p fac fac n p k p hocl hocl p k p cl 2 o c l 2 o p k p cl 2 c l 2 p 5 k obs k p fac fac n k p hocl hocl k p cl 2 o c l 2 o k p cl 2 c l 2 6 k obs k p hocl hocl k p cl 2 o k 2 1 8 k p cl 2 k 3 hocl 2 where p fac hocl cl2o and cl2 are respectively the concentration of isothiazolinone biocide mit or cmit fac hocl cl2o and cl2 m k p i is the second order rate constant between biocide and overall fac or a certain species m 1 s 1 k obs is the observed pseudo first order kinetic constant of biocide s 1 equation 6 can well fit the experimental results in fig 1 a which indicates that an oxidation of biocides by cl2o or cl2 results in 2 orders relative to general fac and an overall third order kinetics at circumneutral ph therefore the fitted n values in fig 1 b demonstrate that either cl2o or cl2 or both of them played important roles during the chlorination of isothiazolinone biocides while hocl contributed to a lesser extent 3 1 2 influence of solution ph and chloride the k obs of mit and cmit dramatically decreased by orders of magnitude with increasing ph an increase of ph from 5 4 to 8 2 resulted in a decrease of k obs from 4 94 10 3 to 2 72 10 5 s 1 for mit and from 6 84 10 4 to 1 62 10 5 s 1 for cmit fig 2 the speciation of isothiazolinone biocides is insignificant within the ph range of this study due to the low pka values of mit 2 03 0 2 and cmit 4 06 0 4 ye et al 2020 this can also be evidenced by the stable uv absorbance at 272 nm in the ph range of 4 9 fig s3 in contrast the speciation of fac is highly ph dependent as quantitatively described by the equilibrium equations text s1 and fig s1 the concentrations of cl2o and cl2 decreased by 2 and 3 orders of magnitude respectively with increasing ph from 5 4 to 8 2 which was identical to the dramatical decrease of k obs thus the strong dependence of k obs on ph can be mainly attributed to fac speciation the addition of cl added increased the k obs of both mit and cmit fig 2 especially under acidic solutions in the presence of cl added fac speciation to cl2 according to eq 3 is enhanced which is most relevant at acidic ph fig s1 enhanced chlorination of isothiazolinone biocides by addition of cl at acidic ph indicates that the oxidation of mit and cmit is dominated by the reaction with cl2 3 1 4 reactivities and contributions of fac species to elucidate the contribution of different fac species the second order rate constants of mit and cmit reacting with individual fac species i e hocl cl2o and cl2 were quantified following a modified process from previous studies lau et al 2019 li et al 2020 we applied a stepwise procedure by first fitting rate constants with hocl and cl2o from experiments at ph 7 1 limited speciation to cl2 followed by quantification of cl2 rate constants from experiments with cl added and several iterations of refitting determined constants see text s3 for details the second order rate constants of mit reacting with hocl cl2o and cl2 were 0 13 1 95 105 and 5 14 105 m 1 s 1 respectively the second order rate constants of cmit reacting with hocl cl2o and cl2 were 0 054 5 70 104 and 7 59 104 m 1 s 1 respectively compared to mit cmit generally showed 1 2 orders of magnitude lower rate constants which may closely relate to the decrease of nucleophilicity by electrophilic cl substitute this can be rationalized by the higher mulliken charge of the s atom in cmit than mit from the gauss simulation table s3 ye et al 2020 compared to other oxidative species e g oh so4 and o3 in table s2 hocl was least reactive to isothiazolinone biocides which was consistent to previously reported 3 4 orders of magnitude lower rate constants for chlorine than ozone deborde et al 2008 cl2 and cl2o were around 6 orders of magnitude more reactive than hocl which is similar to results from previous studies with chlorophenols aliphatic or aromatic alkenes fig s5 sivey et al 2010 gao et al 2018 with the fitted second order rate constants the chlorination kinetics of isothiazolinone biocides were well simulated under various ph values and cl added concentrations fig 2 the contribution of each fac species to the chlorination of biocides can be quantified as the ratio of rate constant of each fac species to total k obs text s3 the contribution of each fac at different conditions and water matrices i e fac dose ph and cl added is shown in fig 3 and fig s6 under neutral ph 7 1 without cl added cl2o oxidation was dominant contributing by more than 75 to the chlorination of both mit and cmit the increase of fac dose further promoted the cl2o oxidation performance under these conditions fig 3a the increase of cl added at circumneutral ph mainly prompted the cl2 oxidation resulting in equal contribution of cl2 and cl2o at cl added of 12 2 mm fig s6 with the solution ph decreased to 5 4 highest k obs values of 4 9 10 3 s 1 and 6 8 10 4 s 1 were observed for mit and cmit respectively all fac species showed higher oxidation rates at lower ph for the degradation of mit and cmit among which cl2o and hocl were the main reactive species at ph 6 5 and cl2 oxidation was most relevant at ph 6 5 fig 3c speciation of hocl to cl2 according to eq 3 under these conditions can be explained by the inherently existing cl in the applied naocl molar ratio of cl to fac was 1 8 in this study notably further added cl amplified the promotion on k obs by cl2 oxidation fig 3d at cl added of 24 4 mm the cl2 oxidation contributed to more 90 of the k obs at acidic ph 5 4 although the cl2o and hocl oxidation did not change compared to neutral ph fig s6 the cl2 oxidation is more important at acidic ph with cl added because both cl and h favor the conversion of hocl to cl2 which is the most reactive fac species to isothiazolinone biocides 3 2 changes of acute toxicity the luminescence inhibition on p phosphoreum t3 bacterium was evaluated to indicate the toxicity evolution under conditions representing cl2o dominated transformation ph 7 1 without cl added comparable cl2o and cl2 transformation ph 5 4 without cl added and cl2 dominated transformation ph 5 4 with cl added of 24 4 mm of biocides the influence of fac residual on luminescent bacterium was excluded by adding na2s2o3 as the quencher which did not affect the luminescence intensity of bacterium the results from luminescence inhibition tests for the chlorinated mit and cmit are shown in fig s7 and s8 as function of the dilution rates the changes of 1 ld 50 and 1 ld 20 were used to quantitatively indicate the acute toxicity evolution during chlorination of mit and cmit respectively the acute toxicity decreased during chlorination with the most rapid rate being observed at ph 5 4 with cl added of 24 4 mm fig s9 the decrease in toxicity in all experiments was proportional to the reduction of mit or cmit concentrations as shown in fig 4 these results indicate that both clo2 and cl2 oxidation efficiently detoxify the isothiazolinone biocides via transformation of parent pollutants without generating toxic tps to further verify the potential toxicity of tps we followed a concept described by mestankova et al 2016 to plot the luminescence inhibition as a function of biocide concentration by transferring the diluted times into biocide concentration residual biocide concentration dilution times fig s10 and s11 if the tps were toxic to luminescent bacterium the curve would shift to left and result in lower ld 20 for mit and ld 50 for cmit the luminescence inhibition of samples before and after chlorination showed strong agreement which further approve that the tps were not toxic or much less toxic than parent isothiazolinone biocides based on all experimental data an lc 20 of 2 2 µm and an ld 50 of 0 30 µm were determined for mit and cmit respectively isothiazolinone is a group of broad spectrum biocides that shows antimicrobial activity by conjugating with the s atom of proteins in bacterium fungus and algae the disulfide bonds s s can inhibit the synthesis of enzymes or adenosine triphosphate morley et al 1998 the observed simultaneous decrease of acute toxicity to bacterium with transformation of the parent compounds therefore indicates that initial attack of fac occurs at the s atom of the isothiazolinone acid 3 3 adsorbable organic chloride aocl the chlorination increased the aocl for mit but decreased the aocl for cmit fig s12 suggesting that both cl addition e g through substitution reaction of fac and cl abstraction played roles during the chlorination of isothiazolinone biocides the decrease of aocl during the chlorination of cmit by 50 however indicated more prominent cl abstraction than cl addition this is confirmed with results from mit which showed only slight cl addition to 10 of initial mit it should be noted however that cl addition might be underestimated from these results because polar tps do potentially not adsorb to activated carbon the major transformation reactions are discussed in more detailed in section 3 4 the faster aocl increase for mit or decrease for cmit in acidic solution ph 5 4 than in neutral solution ph 7 1 is related to reaction kinetics because no differences can be observed when changes of aocl are illustrated as the functions of mit or cmit eliminations fig 5 notably the cl addition at acidic ph 5 4 reduced the aocl elimination for cmit fig 5b which may result from faster cl addition slower cl abstraction or both in addition the cl addition at acidic ph 5 4 hardly influenced the aocl increase for mit fig 5a indicating that cl addition was hardly changed by altering cl2o to cl2 oxidation thus cl abstraction reactions are proposed to be less important during cl2 oxidation compared to reactions with cl2o which is dominant in experiments without cl addition and at neutral ph 3 4 chlorination products 3 4 1 transformation products tps the chlorination eliminated less than 8 2 of the dissolved organic carbon at full elimination of parent isothiazolinone biocides suggesting that most mit and cmit were transformed into organic tps in hplc orbitrap ms measurements six tps from mit and four tps from cmit were detected in esi mode fig s13 while no tps were found in esi mode similar tps were identified under ph 5 4 and 7 1 though the dominant reactive species altered from cl2o to cl2 the chemical formulas of tps were assigned with high resolution mass spectra and chlorine isotopic patterns 35cl 37cl 3 1 of extracted peaks tables s3 and s4 although a final confirmation of the exact chemical structures of tps was not possible without chemical standards the chemical structures of tps were proposed based on corresponding mass spectra of fragment ions ms ms spectra fig s14 s23 none of the detected tps from cmit showed the expected cl abstraction suggested from aocl analyses the inconsistent results between tp identification and aocl measurements indicates that detailed elucidation of the chlorination of cmit needs further research because either total organic chloride does not fully adsorp to activated carbon or relevant tps escape detection in hplc ms measurements tps from mit represent observed changes in aocl while tps from cmit are characterized by abstraction of sulfur 3 of 6 detected products from mit still contained the s atom the main chlorination pathways of mit and cmit are proposed in fig 6 based on the immediate loss of acute toxicity the s atom of isothiazolinone acid can be interpreted as the reactive site of chlorination the s atom of mit is more electron donative than cmit because the cl substitute in cmit decreased the electron density in the isothiazolinone ring the relatively lower electron density at the s atom of cmit has been confirmed with dft calculation table s2 ye et al 2020 and also explains the faster chlorination kinetics observed for mit we therefore propose that the s atom of mit undergoes sulfoxide formation via chloro substitution and hydrolysis according to previous studies deborde et al 2008 which results in the subsequent formation of a sulfoxide tp 132 and a sulfone tp 148 the sulfone group might be further substituted leading to the desulfurized tp 120 sulfoxide and sulfone intermediates were not detected during chlorination of cmit this might be explained by kinetics of individual reactions leading to slow formation but fast chlorination of these intermediates however direct desulfurization of cmit to form tp 120 can also not be excluded tp 120 would further undergo chloro substitution on n atom to form tp 156 or tp 142 with methyl group eliminated which was also observed during the cl2o and cl2 oxidation of organic n atoms freeman et al 1968 further chlorination also induced carboxylation to tp 186 for cmit and hydroxylation leading to tp 166 and tp 170 for mit other tps with lower molecular weight and without chloro substitution were not identified and involved in the proposed chlorination pathway 3 4 2 toxicity of tps besides the inhibition of luminescent bacterium for the cocktails of chlorinated mit or cmit the 96 hour toxicity of the proposed tps to different aquatic species e g fish daphnid and green algae was predicted with the ecosar program as shown in fig s24 in most cases tps were predicted to be less toxic than mit or cmit especially desulfurized tps e g tp 120 tp 156 and tp 142 were 2 4 orders of magnitude less toxic than their parents mit and cmit exceptions included an enhanced toxicity of tp 170 to green algae compared to mit and increased toxicity of tp 186 to fish and daphnid compared to mit and cmit higher toxicity for tp 186 and tp 170 may be related to the dichloro moieties and needs further clarifications 3 5 chlorination in the secondary effluent of wwtp the chlorination kinetics of mit and cmit in secondary effluent of wwtp 8 5 mg c l 1 with an initial fac dose of 0 60 mm are shown in fig s25 the chlorination of secondary effluent was characterized by rapid consumption of fac within few minutes followed by quite stable chlorine concentration with a fac residual of around 0 22 mm thus the elimination of mit and cmit can be well predicted with the kinetics model proposed in eq 6 by considering the fac residual as steady state fac concentration throughout chlorination fig s25 a to further imply the fate of isothiazolinone biocides the experimental results were plotted as a function of fac exposure ct value in fig 7 ultrahigh ct values of 1000 and 4000 mg l 1 min were required to eliminate the biocides mit and cmit in secondary effluent cl 3 0 mm by more than 30 respectively cl2 oxidation dominated the mit elimination and cl2o oxidation dominated the cmit elimination fig s25 b to elucidate the biocide removal at conditions representing the disinfection requirement of hospital wastewater during covid 19 pandemic in china the kinetic model was at neutral ph 7 0 with cl 3 0 mm and fac residual of 0 09 mm at a typical ct value for example 200 mg l 1 min the elimination of biocides was lower than 10 fig 7 elevated fac residual and increased cl concentration to 10 mm which would represent brine treatment do not considerably increase removal of biocides at neutral ph remarkably higher elimination efficiency can only be expected for disinfection in acid solution as predicted for ph 5 5 as an adjustment to acidic ph and spiking of elevated chloride concentration is not feasible for most wastewater applications an effective removal of biocides can only be expected in exceptional cases and alternative measures are needed to improve removal of elevated biocide concentrations 4 conclusions the reaction of free active chlorine species with isothiazolinone biocides resulted in an immediate loss of acute toxicity to bacterium which was attributed to a direct attack at the s atom of the isothiazolinone ring detected transformation products with sulfoxide and sulfone moieties and eventually a loss of the sulfur supports this assumption a decrease of aocl during chlorination of cmit also indicated a certain relevance of chloro abstraction reactions but resulting tps escaped detection toxicity prediction with the ecosar program confirmed that most detected chlorination products are considerably less toxic than parent biocides the chlorination of isothiazolinone biocides is highly favored at acidic ph and in the presence of cl because fac speciates into the more reactive cl2o and cl2 cl2o and cl2 showed 6 orders of magnitude higher second order rate constants than of hocl for the reaction with analyzed isothiazolinone biocides the chlorination kinetics of mit and cmit were successfully predicted by a model consisting of hocl cl2o and cl2 oxidation under various matrix conditions the model confirmed that the chlorination of isothiazolinone at circumneutral ph is mainly attributed to cl2o oxidation 75 while cl2 was most relevant at lower ph and increasing cl concentration experiments and modeling in secondary effluent however only showed considerable biocide removal of 30 with elevated ct of 1000 and 4000 mg l 1 min little isothiazolinone biocide elimination of 10 can be expected at typical applications with around 200 mg l 1 min these results indicate that contribution of chlorination to biocide mitigation is limited and alternative measures might be needed to minimize the discharge of these toxic chemicals into the aquatic environment declaration of competing interest

15603,due to the covid 19 pandemic the worldwide biocides application has been increased which will eventually result in enhanced residuals in treated wastewater at the same time chlorine disinfection of secondary effluents and hospital wastewaters has been intensified with respect to predicted elevated exposure in wastewater the chlorination kinetics transformation pathways and toxicity evolution were investigated in this study for two typical isothiazolinone biocides methyl isothiazolinone mit and chloro methyl isothiazolinone cmit second order rate constants of 0 13 m 1 s 1 1 95 105 m 1 s 1 and 5 14 105 m 1 s 1 were determined for the reaction of mit with hocl cl2o and cl2 respectively while reactivity of cmit was around 1 2 orders of magnitude lower while chlorination of isothiazolinone biocides at ph 7 1 was dominated by cl2o oxidation acidic ph and elevated cl concentration favored free active chlorine fac speciation into cl2 and increased overall isothiazolinone removal regardless of the dominant fac species the elimination of mit and cmit resulted in an immediate loss of acute toxicity under all experimental conditions which was attributed to a preferential attack at the s atom resulting in subsequent formation of sulfoxides and sulfones and eventually an s elimination however chlorination of isothiazolinone biocides in secondary effluent only achieved 10 elimination at typical disinfection chlorine exposure 200 mg l 1 min but was predicted to be remarkably increased by acidizing solution to ph 5 5 alternative measures might be needed to minimize the discharge of

al 2012 sivey et al observed that it was 6 and 7 orders of magnitude more reactive to dimethenamid and aromatic esters sivey et al 2010 sivey et al 2012 the considerably faster reaction of cl2o to some organic chemicals compared to hocl may relate to the distinct reaction patterns as implied by the correlations between reactivity constant and hammett constant lau et al 2016 it was proposed that reactions of cl2o can result in the formation of organic radicals and secondary reactive chlorine species cl and clo renard et al 1976 isothiaozolinone biocides contain a n and s heterocyclic ring and have not been investigated for their reactivities with cl2 and cl2o in different water matrices e g ph chlorides and dissolved organic matter in addition to the chlorination kinetics the preferential reactive sites chlorination products and effects of chlorination on toxicity are also unknown for isothiaozolinone biocides as the more intensive application of biocides coincides with more stringent requirements for chlorination in some countries research is needed to determine the kinetics for the reaction of isothiazolinone compounds with fac quantify contribution of individual fac species and identify representative chlorination pathways this study aims to assess the chlorination kinetics of representative isothiazolinone biocides mit and cmit in various matrix backgrounds ph chloride and

acute toxicity of target pollutants is a serious concern for chlorination hu et al 2003 huang et al 2020 and might be affected by the different reaction mechanisms of most dominant fac species gao et

experiments 2 1 chemicals and materials selected isothiazolinone biocides mit 98 purity and cmit 98 purity naocl solution with a mass ratio of 10 and methanol with hplc grade were purchased from j k

stock solution 2 g l 1 cl2 equivalent was prepared by diluting the 10 naocl solution the chlorination experiments were conducted by spiking specific volumes of fac stock into mit 15 2 µm or cmit 8 4 µm solutions buffered by 10 mm nah2po4 2h2o resulting in initial fac doses fac 0 of 0 2 3 7 mm the applied molar concentration of fac 0 was ten times higher than biocide concentration and thus assumed as constant during the chlorination to evaluate the adsorbable organic chlorine aocl during chlorination the concentrations of both biocides and chlorines was increased by ten times for chlorination experiments the solution ph was adjusted to 5 4 8 5 with naoh 5 m the exact fac at the beginning of the experiment was measured by the colorimetric method with dpd reagent on a photometer hi93711

total and extracted ions mass to charge m z and the mass spectra were analyzed with the xcalibur software 2 3 3 toxicity evaluation the acute toxicity of mit and cmit before and after chlorination was assessed by the luminesce inhibition to photobacterium phosphoreum t3 the luminesce inhibition was measured at various dilution times for each sample and acute toxicity was quantitatively expressed as the dilution times that induced 20 ld 20 and 50 ld 50 of luminesce inhibitions for mit and cmit respectively the ld 20 was selected for mit because the luminesce inhibition by mit was relatively low especially after chlorination in comparison to luminesce inhibition which depends on the range of the toxicity dose response ld 50 or ld 20 can provide a valid toxicity assessment at any biocide concentration the details of the toxicity evaluation are described in text s2 2 3 4 adsorbable organic chloride aocl the aocl were measured using a multi x 2500 aox analyzer analytik jena germany after adsorption onto an activated carbon column and washing by sodium nitrate to remove inorganic chloride the activated carbon was burned in oxygen and the generated hcl was adsorbed by 14 ml water chloride in the final solution was determined by the micro coulomb titration method 3 results and discussion 3 1 chlorination kinetics 3 1 1 influence of fac dose the chlorination of mit and cmit followed pseudo first order kinetics fig s2 and eq 4 because the fac concentration was at least one order of magnitude higher than biocides and was almost constant during the reaction thus the reaction order was determined as 1 in biocides to verify the fac related reaction order n the chlorination kinetics of mit and cmit were evaluated at various fac doses at ph 6 6 and 7 1 the observed kinetic constants k obs of mit and cmit obviously increased with increasing fac dose at ph 6 6 and ph 7 1 fig 1 a the increase of k obs however did not linearly correlate with fac dose indicating that the reaction does not follow second order kinetics and the order n relative to fac is higher than 1 by plotting the logarithmic curves between k obs and fac doses following eq 5 the values of fac related reaction order n at ph 7 1 were fitted as 1 76 0 05 and 1 91 0 07 for mit and cmit respectively fig 1 b in comparison to hocl cl2o and cl2 ocl is much less reactive to organic pollutants gallard et al 2002 choe et al 2021 in this study the k obs at ph 7 1 was already considerably lower than at ph 6 6 which confirmed the much lower reactivity of ocl to isothiazolinone biocides thus hocl cl2o and cl2 were proposed as the main facs contributing to the degradation of biocides eq s13 s15 and ocl neglected for the degradation kinetics described in eq 5 considering the speciation of fac in eq 2 3 the cl2o and cl2 in eq 5 can be expressed as a function of hocl text s1 eq 6 4 d p d t k p fac fac n p k p hocl hocl p k p cl 2 o c l 2 o p k p cl 2 c l 2 p 5 k obs k p fac fac n k p hocl hocl k p cl 2 o c l 2 o k p cl 2 c l 2 6 k obs k p hocl hocl k p cl 2 o k 2 1 8 k p cl 2 k 3 hocl 2 where p fac hocl cl2o and cl2 are respectively the concentration of isothiazolinone biocide mit or cmit fac hocl cl2o and cl2 m k p i is the second order rate constant between biocide and overall fac or a certain species m 1 s 1 k obs is the observed pseudo first order kinetic constant of biocide s 1 equation 6 can well fit the experimental results in fig 1 a which indicates that an oxidation of biocides by cl2o or cl2 results in 2 orders relative to general fac and an overall third order kinetics at circumneutral ph therefore the fitted n values in fig 1 b demonstrate that either cl2o or cl2 or both of them played important roles during the chlorination of isothiazolinone biocides while hocl contributed to a lesser extent 3 1 2 influence of solution ph and chloride the k obs of mit and cmit dramatically decreased by orders of magnitude with increasing ph an increase of ph from 5 4 to 8 2 resulted in a decrease of k obs from 4 94 10 3 to 2 72 10 5 s 1 for mit and from 6 84 10 4 to 1 62 10 5 s 1 for cmit fig 2 the speciation of isothiazolinone biocides is insignificant within the ph range of this study due to the low pka values of mit 2 03 0 2 and cmit 4 06 0 4 ye et al 2020 this can also be evidenced by the stable uv absorbance at 272 nm in the ph range of 4 9 fig s3 in contrast the speciation of fac is highly ph dependent as quantitatively described by the equilibrium equations text s1 and fig s1 the concentrations of cl2o and cl2 decreased by 2 and 3 orders of magnitude respectively with increasing ph from 5 4 to 8 2 which was identical to the dramatical decrease of k obs thus the strong dependence of k obs on ph can be mainly attributed to fac speciation the addition of cl added increased the k obs of both mit and cmit fig 2 especially under acidic solutions in the presence of cl added fac speciation to cl2 according to eq 3 is enhanced which is most relevant at acidic ph fig s1 enhanced chlorination of isothiazolinone biocides by addition of cl at acidic ph indicates that the oxidation of mit and cmit is dominated by the reaction with cl2 3 1 4 reactivities and contributions of fac species to elucidate the contribution of different fac species the second order rate constants of mit and cmit reacting with individual fac species i e hocl cl2o and cl2 were quantified following a modified process from previous studies lau et al 2019 li et al 2020 we applied a stepwise procedure by first fitting rate constants with hocl and cl2o from experiments at ph 7 1 limited speciation to cl2 followed by quantification of cl2 rate constants from experiments with cl added and several iterations of refitting determined constants see text s3 for details the second order rate constants of mit reacting with hocl cl2o and cl2 were 0 13 1 95 105 and 5 14 105 m 1 s 1 respectively the second order rate constants of cmit reacting with hocl cl2o and cl2 were 0 054 5 70 104 and 7 59 104 m 1 s 1 respectively compared to mit cmit generally showed 1 2 orders of magnitude lower rate constants which may closely relate to the decrease of nucleophilicity by electrophilic cl substitute this can be rationalized by the higher mulliken charge of the s atom in cmit than mit from the gauss simulation table s3 ye et al 2020 compared to other oxidative species e g oh so4 and o3 in table s2 hocl was least reactive to isothiazolinone biocides which was consistent to previously reported 3 4 orders of magnitude lower rate constants for chlorine than ozone deborde et al 2008 cl2 and cl2o were around 6 orders of magnitude more reactive than hocl which is similar to results from previous studies with chlorophenols aliphatic or aromatic alkenes fig s5 sivey et al 2010 gao et al 2018 with the fitted second order rate constants the chlorination kinetics of isothiazolinone biocides were well simulated under various ph values and cl added concentrations fig 2 the contribution of each fac species to the chlorination of biocides can be quantified as the ratio of rate constant of each fac species to total k obs text s3 the contribution of each fac at different conditions and water matrices i e fac dose ph and cl added is shown in fig 3 and fig s6 under neutral ph 7 1 without cl added cl2o oxidation was dominant contributing by more than 75 to the chlorination of both mit and cmit the increase of fac dose further promoted the cl2o oxidation performance under these conditions fig 3a the increase of cl added at circumneutral ph mainly prompted the cl2 oxidation resulting in equal contribution of cl2 and cl2o at cl added of 12 2 mm fig s6 with the solution ph decreased to 5 4 highest k obs values of 4 9 10 3 s 1 and 6 8 10 4 s 1 were observed for mit and cmit respectively all fac species showed higher oxidation rates at lower ph for the degradation of mit and cmit among which cl2o and hocl were the main reactive species at ph 6 5 and cl2 oxidation was most relevant at ph 6 5 fig 3c speciation of hocl to cl2 according to eq 3 under these conditions can be explained by the inherently existing cl in the applied naocl molar ratio of cl to fac was 1 8 in this study notably further added cl amplified the promotion on k obs by cl2 oxidation fig 3d at cl added of 24 4 mm the cl2 oxidation contributed to more 90 of the k obs at acidic ph 5 4 although the cl2o and hocl oxidation did not change compared to neutral ph fig s6 the cl2 oxidation is more important at acidic ph with cl added because both cl and h favor the conversion of hocl to cl2 which is the most reactive fac species to isothiazolinone biocides 3 2 changes of acute toxicity the luminescence inhibition on p phosphoreum t3 bacterium was evaluated to indicate the toxicity evolution under conditions representing cl2o dominated transformation ph 7 1 without cl added comparable cl2o and cl2 transformation ph 5 4 without cl added and cl2 dominated transformation ph 5 4 with cl added of 24 4 mm of biocides the influence of fac residual on luminescent bacterium was excluded by adding na2s2o3 as the quencher which did not affect the luminescence intensity of bacterium the results from luminescence inhibition tests for the chlorinated mit and cmit are shown in fig s7 and s8 as function of the dilution rates the changes of 1 ld 50 and 1 ld 20 were used to quantitatively indicate the acute toxicity evolution during chlorination of mit and cmit respectively the acute toxicity decreased during chlorination with the most rapid rate being observed at ph 5 4 with cl added of 24 4 mm fig s9 the decrease in toxicity in all experiments was proportional to the reduction of mit or cmit concentrations as shown in fig 4 these results indicate that both clo2 and cl2 oxidation efficiently detoxify the isothiazolinone biocides via transformation of parent pollutants without generating toxic tps to further verify the potential toxicity of tps we followed a concept described by mestankova et al 2016 to plot the luminescence inhibition as a function of biocide concentration by transferring the diluted times into biocide concentration residual biocide concentration dilution times fig s10 and s11 if the tps were toxic to luminescent bacterium the curve would shift to left and result in lower ld 20 for mit and ld 50 for cmit the luminescence inhibition of samples before and after chlorination showed strong agreement which further approve that the tps were not toxic or much less toxic than parent isothiazolinone biocides based on all experimental data an lc 20 of 2 2 µm and an ld 50 of 0 30 µm were determined for mit and cmit respectively isothiazolinone is a group of broad spectrum biocides that shows antimicrobial activity by conjugating with the s atom of proteins in bacterium fungus and algae the disulfide bonds s s can inhibit the synthesis of enzymes or adenosine triphosphate morley et al 1998 the observed simultaneous decrease of acute toxicity to bacterium with transformation of the parent compounds therefore indicates that initial attack of fac occurs at the s atom of the isothiazolinone acid 3 3 adsorbable organic chloride aocl the chlorination increased the aocl for mit but decreased the aocl for cmit fig s12 suggesting that both cl addition e g through substitution reaction of fac and cl abstraction played roles during the chlorination of isothiazolinone biocides the decrease of aocl during the chlorination of cmit by 50 however indicated more prominent cl abstraction than cl addition this is confirmed with results from mit which showed only slight cl addition to 10 of initial mit it should be noted however that cl addition might be underestimated from these results because polar tps do potentially not adsorb to activated carbon the major transformation reactions are discussed in more detailed in section 3 4 the faster aocl increase for mit or decrease for cmit in acidic solution ph 5 4 than in neutral solution ph 7 1 is related to reaction kinetics because no differences can be observed when changes of aocl are illustrated as the functions of mit or cmit eliminations fig 5 notably the cl addition at acidic ph 5 4 reduced the aocl elimination for cmit fig 5b which may result from faster cl addition slower cl abstraction or both in addition the cl addition at acidic ph 5 4 hardly influenced the aocl increase for mit fig 5a indicating that cl addition was hardly changed by altering cl2o to cl2 oxidation thus cl abstraction reactions are proposed to be less important during cl2 oxidation compared to reactions with cl2o which is dominant in experiments without cl addition and at neutral ph 3 4 chlorination products 3 4 1 transformation products tps the chlorination eliminated less than 8 2 of the dissolved organic carbon at full elimination of parent isothiazolinone biocides suggesting that most mit and cmit were transformed into organic tps in hplc orbitrap ms measurements six tps from mit and four tps from cmit were detected in esi mode fig s13 while no tps were found in esi mode similar tps were identified under ph 5 4 and 7 1 though the dominant reactive species altered from cl2o to cl2 the chemical formulas of tps were assigned with high resolution mass spectra and chlorine isotopic patterns 35cl 37cl 3 1 of extracted peaks tables s3 and s4 although a final confirmation of the exact chemical structures of tps was not possible without chemical standards the chemical structures of tps were proposed based on corresponding mass spectra of fragment ions ms ms spectra fig s14 s23 none of the detected tps from cmit showed the expected cl abstraction suggested from aocl analyses the inconsistent results between tp identification and aocl measurements indicates that detailed elucidation of the chlorination of cmit needs further research because either total organic chloride does not fully adsorp to activated carbon or relevant tps escape detection in hplc ms measurements tps from mit represent observed changes in aocl while tps from cmit are characterized by abstraction of sulfur 3 of 6 detected products from mit still contained the s atom the main chlorination pathways of mit and cmit are proposed in fig 6 based on the immediate loss of acute toxicity the s atom of isothiazolinone acid can be interpreted as the reactive site of chlorination the s atom of mit is more electron donative than cmit because the cl substitute in cmit decreased the electron density in the isothiazolinone ring the relatively lower electron density at the s atom of cmit has been confirmed with dft calculation table s2 ye et al 2020 and also explains the faster chlorination kinetics observed for mit we therefore propose that the s atom of mit undergoes sulfoxide formation via chloro substitution and hydrolysis according to previous studies deborde et al 2008 which results in the subsequent formation of a sulfoxide tp 132 and a sulfone tp 148 the sulfone group might be further substituted leading to the desulfurized tp 120 sulfoxide and sulfone intermediates were not detected during chlorination of cmit this might be explained by kinetics of individual reactions leading to slow formation but fast chlorination of these intermediates however direct desulfurization of cmit to form tp 120 can also not be excluded tp 120 would further undergo chloro substitution on n atom to form tp 156 or tp 142 with methyl group eliminated which was also observed during the cl2o and cl2 oxidation of organic n atoms freeman et al 1968 further chlorination also induced carboxylation to tp 186 for cmit and hydroxylation leading to tp 166 and tp 170 for mit other tps with lower molecular weight and without chloro substitution were not identified and involved in the proposed chlorination pathway 3 4 2 toxicity of tps besides the inhibition of luminescent bacterium for the cocktails of chlorinated mit or cmit the 96 hour toxicity of the proposed tps to different aquatic species e g fish daphnid and green algae was predicted with the ecosar program as shown in fig s24 in most cases tps were predicted to be less toxic than mit or cmit especially desulfurized tps e g tp 120 tp 156 and tp 142 were 2 4 orders of magnitude less toxic than their parents mit and cmit exceptions included an enhanced toxicity of tp 170 to green algae compared to mit and increased toxicity of tp 186 to fish and daphnid compared to mit and cmit higher toxicity for tp 186 and tp 170 may be related to the dichloro moieties and needs further clarifications 3 5 chlorination in the secondary effluent of wwtp the chlorination kinetics of mit and cmit in secondary effluent of wwtp 8 5 mg c l 1 with an initial fac dose of 0 60 mm are shown in fig s25 the chlorination of secondary effluent was characterized by rapid consumption of fac within few minutes followed by quite stable chlorine concentration with a fac residual of around 0 22 mm thus the elimination of mit and cmit can be well predicted with the kinetics model proposed in eq 6 by considering the fac residual as steady state fac concentration throughout chlorination fig s25 a to further imply the fate of isothiazolinone biocides the experimental results were plotted as a function of fac exposure ct value in fig 7 ultrahigh ct values of 1000 and 4000 mg l 1 min were required to eliminate the biocides mit and cmit in secondary effluent cl 3 0 mm by more than 30 respectively cl2 oxidation dominated the mit elimination and cl2o oxidation dominated the cmit elimination fig s25 b to elucidate the biocide removal at conditions representing the disinfection requirement of hospital wastewater during covid 19 pandemic in china the kinetic model was at neutral ph 7 0 with cl 3 0 mm and fac residual of 0 09 mm at a typical ct value for example 200 mg l 1 min the elimination of biocides was lower than 10 fig 7 elevated fac residual and increased cl concentration to 10 mm which would represent brine treatment do not considerably increase removal of biocides at neutral ph remarkably higher elimination efficiency can only be expected for disinfection in acid solution as predicted for ph 5 5 as an adjustment to acidic ph and spiking of elevated chloride concentration is not feasible for most wastewater applications an effective removal of biocides can only be expected in exceptional cases and alternative measures are needed to improve removal of elevated biocide concentrations 4 conclusions the reaction of free active chlorine species with isothiazolinone biocides resulted in an immediate loss of acute toxicity to bacterium which was attributed to a direct attack at the s atom of the isothiazolinone ring detected transformation products with sulfoxide and sulfone moieties and eventually a loss of the sulfur supports this assumption a decrease of aocl during chlorination of cmit also indicated a certain relevance of chloro abstraction reactions but resulting tps escaped detection toxicity prediction with the ecosar program confirmed that most detected chlorination products are considerably less toxic than parent biocides the chlorination of isothiazolinone biocides is highly favored at acidic ph and in the presence of cl because fac speciates into the more reactive cl2o and cl2 cl2o and cl2 showed 6 orders of magnitude higher second order rate constants than of hocl for the reaction with analyzed isothiazolinone biocides the chlorination kinetics of mit and cmit were successfully predicted by a model consisting of hocl cl2o and cl2 oxidation under various matrix conditions the model confirmed that the chlorination of isothiazolinone at circumneutral ph is mainly attributed to cl2o oxidation 75 while cl2 was most relevant at lower ph and increasing cl concentration experiments and modeling in secondary effluent however only showed considerable biocide removal of 30 with elevated ct of 1000 and 4000 mg l 1 min little isothiazolinone biocide elimination of 10 can be expected at typical applications with around 200 mg l 1 min these results indicate that contribution of chlorination to biocide mitigation is limited and alternative measures might be needed to minimize the discharge of these toxic chemicals into the aquatic environment declaration of competing interest

15604,in this study a novel wastewater treatment process combining sequencing batch reactor constructed wetland and microalgal membrane photobioreactor bcm process was proposed and its performance on removal transformation and toxicity reduction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs was intensively explored satisfactory pahs removal 90 58 97 50 was achieved and molecular weight had significant impact on the removal pathways of different pahs adsorption dominated the removal of high molecular weight pahs while the contribution ratio of microbial degradation increased with the decrease of molecular weight of pahs more importantly it was reported for the first time that substituted pahs spahs produced by microbial degradation of pahs would lead to increased toxicity during the bcm process high pahs 75 37 88 52 and spahs removal 99 56 100 00 were achieved in the microalgae unit due to its abundant cytochrome p450 enzyme which decreased the bacterial toxicity by 90 93 and genotoxicity by 93 08 indicating that microalgae played significance important role in ensuring water security in addition the high quantitative relationship r2 0 98 between pahs spahs and toxicity exhibited by regression model analysis proved that more attention should be paid to the ecotoxicity of derivatives of refractory organic matters in wastewater treatment plants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons wastewater treatment ecotoxicity water quality security data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction in recent years the hybrid system that combines biological treatment and constructed wetlands has been regarded as a promising technology and widely used in domestic wastewater due to its low operation cost and consistent effluent quality nas et al 2020 wan et al 2019 however existing studies only focus on conventional pollutants such as nitrogen and phosphorous wang and tian 2021 and little attention have been paid to the removal of emerging trace pollutants which played a more important role in the wastewater toxicity than conventional pollutants maletic et al 2019 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs which are mainly produced by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and organic matters are typical emerging trace pollutants because of its significant mutagenesis carcinogenicity and toxicity lu et al 2022 as reported previously plentiful pahs 400 7200 ng l existed in the domestic wastewater of china sun et al 2018 however pahs are difficult to be degraded in wastewater treatment plants wwtps due to its hydrophobicity and stable property it was reported that the removal efficiency of pahs in secondary treatment of traditional wwtps was 45 82 qiao et al 2017 therefore it is critical to improve pahs removal efficiency of domestic wastewater with the growing concern about water security and increasing demand of wastewater reuse derivatives and hazards produced during biological or ecological treatment of refractory organic pollutants such as pahs have been the focus of research in recent years zhang et al 2022 substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons spahs such as nitrated pahs npahs were reported to be generated due to the microbial transformation process and have received widespread attention due to their relatively high toxicity in comparison to their corresponding pahs zhao et al 2019 for example previous studies found that 1 nitropyrene 1 np a typical npah possessed higher carcinogenicity and genotoxicity than their parent pahs due to the presence of nitro groups alves et al 2016 bandowe and meusel 2017 spahs were widespread in the effluent of wwtps 126 15 2 ng l due to the microbial transformation of pahs qiao et al 2014 which implied that the effluent of wwtps possessed the risk of increased toxicity recently physicochemical techniques such as advanced oxidation have been utilized to remove spahs forsey et al 2010 however the problem of high operation cost limited their practical application thus it is important to improve biological and ecological combination process so as to reduce the effluent toxicity and ensure water security microalgae have promising application potential in wastewater treatment because of their higher nutrients demand during biomass growth when compared with heterotrophic bacteria and the production of high value products liu et al 2021a previous studies found that microalgal membrane photobioreactor mbpr was a feasible technology to treat wastewater which could achieve excellent performance for removal of nitrogen 96 and phosphorus 85 through assimilation of microalgae lee et al 2018 in addition microalgae also have unique advantages in removing refractory organic matters and their derivatives hena et al 2021 nguyen et al 2021 the cytochrome p450 enzyme cyp 450 of microalgae could convert refractory organic matters and their derivatives into hydrophilic compounds through inserting pro electronics group e g cooh and then the hydrophilic compounds could be further transformed to less toxic compounds by electrophilic addition and epoxidation zhou et al 2022 recently it has been proved that microalgae could achieve 100 b a p removal and 99 8 1 methylphenanthrene removal through microbial degradation and biosorption garcía de llasera et al 2016 luo et al 2020 therefore it is promising to integrate microalgal technology to wastewater treatment process to reduce the effluent toxicity of wastewater treatment process and ensure water security in this study a novel biological constructed wetland microalgal wastewater treatment system bcm system was established for efficient pahs removal to ensure the effluent security the purpose of this study was 1 to investigate the potential removal of nutrients and pahs in the bcm system 2 to elucidate the pahs transformation and dynamic of toxicity in the bcm system 3 to illustrate the mechanism of pah risk prevention and control in the bcm system through stoichiometric analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment system configuration two parallel bcm systems each composed of sequencing batch reactor sbr followed by vertical flow constructed wetland vfcw and microalgal membrane photobioreactor mbpr were built at shandong university qingdao china fig 1 indicates the schematic diagram of the system the sbr possessed a working volume of 4 l and had a diameter of 10 cm and a height of 60 cm a sludge outlet was positioned at the bottom of the reactor and an effluent outlet was constructed at 25 cm height from the bottom of the reactor the lab scale vfcw located behind the sbr was 32 cm in diameter and 70 cm in height vfcw was filled with three substrate layers which consisted of bottom layer of 5 cm quartz sand 1 3 cm in diameter as the supporting layer middle layer of 50 cm zeolite 4 8 mm in diameter and a surface layer of 5 cm washed sand 1 mm in diameter a vertically perforated pvc pipe was inserted into the vfcw in order to measure various physical and chemical parameters in situ iris pseudacorus was chosen as the plant species of vfcw and was planted at a density of 100 rhizomes m2 mbpr was the final process of bcm system which was 15 cm in diameter and 40 cm in height chlorella vulgaris was selected as algae species a membrane module consisting polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf hollow fiber membranes with a pore size of 0 04 μm was added based on luo et al 2018 a magnetic stirrer was prepared below the device to mix microalgae culture to boost the growth of microalgae 2 2 operation of experiment system the total experimental period was divided into two periods i e start up and stabilized period the domestication and culture process for the plants and microorganisms was performed for approximately one month during the start up period the synthetic wastewater was prepared in a storage tank 80 l and introduced into the sbr using a peristaltic pump during the whole experiment period sbr was operated at a volumetric exchange ratio of 50 with a cycle of 4 h resulting in a hydraulic retention time hrt of 8 h the procedure of each cycle was consisted of 30 min for filling 120 min for aeration to maintain dissolved oxygen do concentration at 0 5 1 0 mg l 30 min for settling and 30 min for discharging effluent the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss of the sbr was maintained at 2500 3000 mg l and the ph of the sbr was 7 0 8 0 afterward the effluent of sbr was induced into a settling tank and then pumped continuously into the vfcw at hrt of 2 days the effluent of vfcw was then routed into the mbpr and finally pumped out from hollow fiber membranes through a pump the initial microalgae density of mbpr was 5 105 cells ml and mpbr was illuminated by fluorescence lamps that caused average light intensity on mpbr surface was approximately 85 μmol m2s the hrt of mbpr was 2 days luo et al 2018 microalgae was drained periodically to maintain the algal density at 106 cells ml in mbpr and sludge retention time srt of mbpr was 18 days due to the growth of microalgae the ph of mbpr was slightly alkaline ph 8 0 9 5 the synthetic wastewater per liter was consisted of sucrose 267 38 mg nh4 2so4 169 75 mg and kh2po4 21 97 mg to create a concentration of organic matter cod of 300 mg l ammonia nitrogen nh4 n of 40 mg l and total phosphorus tp of 5 mg l additionally 1 ml trace element table s1 was added per liter wastewater in order to better simulate the actual wastewater situation and to more realistically evaluate the effectiveness of the technology a mixture of several pahs including naphthalene nap acenaphthene ace pyrene pyr benzo k fluoranthene b k f and benzo a pyrene b a p was selected in this study as targeted pollutants referring to previously reported pahs concentration in wwtps fatone et al 2011 qiao et al 2014 the concentration of 5 kinds of pahs was determined as nap 0 63 μg l ace 0 28 μg l pyr 0 11 μg l b k f 0 08 μg l b a p 0 06 μg l the detailed information about physical and chemical properties of pahs are shown in table s2 2 3 sampling and analysis 2 3 1 physicochemical parameters the influent and effluent of sbr vfcw and mbpr were collected every 2 days and then filtered by 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane with syringe cod nh4 n nitrate no3 n nitrite no2 n total nitrogen tn and tp concentrations were determined based on the standard methods apha 2012 immediately after sampling all samples were measured in triplicate do ph meter hq 40d hach usa was utilized in situ to measure the do concentration and ph 2 3 2 pahs and spahs measurement the effluent from sbr vfcw and mbpr was sampled every 4 days to measure the concentration of pahs and spahs pahs in water samples were extracted by solid phase extraction dichloromethane methanol and ultrapure water were added successively to realize the activation of c18 extraction membrane liu et al 2021b water samples 200 ml with surrogate p terphenyl d14 and 2 fluobiphenyl were passed through a c18 extraction membrane using a solid phase extractor extrapid then the organic phase was eluted with dichloromethane for 20 min and concentrated to 1 ml by automatic parallel concentrator lab tech china for further determination polyurethane foam puf was utilized to measure the pahs concentration in the gas sample produced by each reactor puf was first pre cleaned by soaking in dichloromethane and then was extracted by using dichloromethane and hexane saber et al 2021 finally the extracted organic phase was concentrated to 1 ml for measurement sludge and microalgae samples 50 ml were collected during the operation period in polytetrafluoroethylene tube and freeze dried for 48 h afterward dichloromethane 50 ml was added and placed in an ultrasonic water bath to shake for 1 h before being concentrated to 1 ml for measurement plant and substrate samples were sampled after the experiment and then washed and freeze dried 48 h before being measured the further detection method of pahs concentration in the substrate and plant was based on kang et al 2019 pahs and spahs concentrations were quantified by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms shimadzu japan qp2020 under selected ion monitor sim mode with the internal standard method the internal standard was decachlorobiphenyl and surrogate were p terphenyl d14 and 2 fluobiphenyl the comprehensive detection procedure and method was described in qiao et al 2013 the concentration of pahs and spahs measured in all samples were higher than limits of quantification loq and the detection method could achieve excellent recovery for pahs and spahs and ensure the accuracy of experimental data detailed in supporting information content s1 mass balance was used to evaluate the removal capability and removal mechanism of the whole system for pahs which was carried out by using the concentration of pahs detected in water substrates plants sludges microalgae and gas samples the detailed mass balance calculation was shown in the supporting information content s2 2 3 3 physiological indicators before and after the experiment the activated sludge plant and microalgae were sampled the stress level of sludge plant and microalgae was evaluated by the measurement of antioxidant enzyme sod and cat activity the detailed measurement method was described in carias et al 2008 feng et al 2022 the maximum fluorescence of photosystem ii fv fm was measured by the chlorophyll fluorescence instrument walz junior pam germany additionally the cyp 450 enzyme concentration was measured based on previous studies ning and wang 2012 2 3 4 toxicity assays toxicity of the effluent from sbr vfcw and mbpr was measured every 4 days after adding pahs by v fischeri nrrl b 1177 sredlova et al 2020 the bacterial suspension 20 μl was added to 180 μl samples and bioluminescence inhibition was measured after exposure for 15 min the mixture of 3 sodium chloride solution and bacterial solution was used as a negative control the relative intensity of the luminescence in samples r and negative control r0 was measured to calculate the potential luminescence inhibition i of the water samples according to eq 1 1 i r 0 r r 0 in order to evaluate the genotoxicity of water samples sos umu tests were performed using salmonella typhimurium ta1535 psk1002 without s9 activation 4 nitroquinoline n oxide 4 nqo and 1 dmso were set as a positive and negative control in the sos umu test respectively tang et al 2020 the absorbance at 420 nm and 600 nm was measured using a microplate meter to calculate the ir of the water sample which was based on previous reports zhang et al 2017 in addition to determine the carcinogenic potential of pah the toxic equivalent concentration teqb a p of 5 pahs was calculated based on its toxicity relative to b a p using the relative toxic equivalent factor tef described by berardi et al 2019 the calculation equation was based on the eq 2 2 te q b a p c tef where c depicts the concentration of each pah μg l and the tef represents the toxic equivalency factor for each compound table s2 2 3 5 microbial analysis to assess the microbial community of sbr and vfcw activated sludges and substrate samples were collected at the end of the experiment and analyzed with illumina high throughput sequencing analysis conducted by novogene co ltd beijing china the detailed procedures are illustrated in the supporting information content s3 2 3 6 statistical analyses pearson correlation coefficients and stepwise regression models were calculated to evaluate the relationship and quantitative response relationships between toxicity and pahs and spahs concentration using spss statistics 25 0 when the p value was less than 0 05 significant data difference was considered 3 results and discussion 3 1 pollutants removal performance the overall pollutant performance cod nh4 n tn and tp in the bcm system is shown in fig 2 the effluent cod concentration of sbr vfcw and mbpr was 106 34 9 87 22 95 3 05 mg l and 10 69 1 37 mg l respectively fig 2a organics were removed efficiently by substrate adsorption and microbial degradation in vfcw the results of eem fig s1 revealed that the easily biodegradable organic matter was efficiently removed after the treatment of vfcw and the effluent of vfcw showed poorer biodegradability than that of sbr detailed in supporting information content s4 microalgae were autotrophic organisms and their organics removal mechanism was differed from that of bacteria microalgae could remove organics through assimilation and biosorption rather than microbial degradation abdel raouf et al 2012 al jabri et al 2021 therefore mbpr could further remove the refractory organic matter and then decrease the cod the whole system achieved efficient removal of organic matters due to the microbial degradation by microorganism and assimilation by microalgae in terms of nh4 n the nh4 n removal efficiency of sbr was only 41 49 7 47 which was lower than other studies 71 20 85 70 cai et al 2022 it could be calculated that ammonia oxidation rate was 0 91 1 33 mg nh4 n g mlss 1 h 1 which was also lower than previous studies 5 28 to 18 25 mg nh4 n g mlss 1 h 1 shao et al 2017 nitrification was an aerobic process which was generally believed that could be occurred smoothly when do concentration was greater than 1 5 mg l lu et al 2020 however do concentration was controlled at 0 5 1 0 mg l in sbr of the present study therefore nitrification was inhibited and thus led to the restricted nh4 removal in sbr nh4 n was effectively removed in vfcw and the effluent nh4 n was 7 87 1 42 mg l zeolite in the substrate could remove nh4 n from wastewater by adsorption and cation exchange han et al 2019 more importantly zeolite with high ion exchange and adsorption capacity improves the adhesion of nh4 n to substrate microbial membrane and further enhances the nitrification he et al 2017 thus vfcw possessed excellent nh4 n removal efficiency throughout the experimental period no2 and no3 were below 0 1 mg l in sbr and mbpr with no obvious fluctuation and the effluent no2 and no3 of vfcw were enhanced due to improved ammonia nitrogen oxidation fig s2 as shown in fig 2c the effluent tn of the vfcw and mbpr was 9 80 1 08 mg l and 1 15 0 23 mg l respectively in addition the effluent tp concentrations of vfcw and mbpr was 1 11 0 16 mg l and 0 05 0 01 mg l respectively it could be noted that mbpr performed excellent tn and tp removal which was also reported by wang et al 2015 and sukacova et al 2015 based on the previous analysis of eem the effluent of vfcw was mainly refractory organic matters that are difficult for microorganism to utilize additionally the average cod concentration was low 22 95 mg l making physicochemical removal uneconomical microalgae could mainly rely on assimilation rather than microbial degradation to achieve efficient nitrogen and phosphorus removal even if the influent cod concentration was low and was mainly composed of refractory organic matters abdel raouf et al 2012 previous studies also reported that microalgae could reach uptake capacities of 1 0 g n m 2 d 1 and 0 13 g p m 2 d 1 even without organic sources boelee et al 2011 therefore it is economical and effective to remove nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater using microalgae even when carbon sources are scarce and low bioavailability which is promising in the wastewater treatment 3 2 pahs removal and transformation fig 3 a shows the effluent concentration of five kinds of pahs at each stage of the bcm system specifically it could be obtained from fig 3a that the combined sbr and vfcw stage mainly achieved efficient degradation of low molecular weight lwh pahs nap ace pyr 60 60 82 61 however the removal efficiency of hwh pahs b k f and b a p was lower 51 63 55 60 previous studies also proved that the removal of lwh pahs 78 16 3 13 was higher than that of hwh 45 06 10 81 in the biological treatment zhou et al 2022 this was because hwh pahs possessed higher hydrophobicity and stability than lwh pahs which was difficult for the biodegradation specifically the removal efficiency of b a p in sbr was only 9 92 this was because b a p tended to retain their conjugated ring systems and was difficult to be biodegraded zhao et al 2019 also reported that the sbr only possessed 8 68 removal efficiency of hwh pahs mbpr showed excellent pahs removal especially the hwh pahs 64 82 73 59 this was not only because the presence of sbr and vfcw reduced the pollution load of pahs laying the foundation for mbpr to efficiently degrade pahs but more importantly microalgae could efficiently degrade hwh pahs through microbial degradation and biosorption which was also proved by previous study garcia de llasera et al 2016 the influent of mbpr with or without light during the hrt 2d was explored and no significant difference in pahs removal was obtained fig s3 hence photolysis was considered to be neglectable in pahs removal in this study similar phenomenon has also been reported in previous studies nguyen et al 2021 xiong et al 2017 to sum up the whole system obtained efficient removal 90 58 97 50 of 5 kinds of pahs as previously reported the removal efficiency of pahs was only 72 after the treatment of wwtps ozaki et al 2015 which was lower than the removal efficiency reported in this study these results demonstrated that bcm process achieves better pahs removal efficiency and has promising prospect in the engineering application the results of gc ms chromatogram fig s4 showed that 2 methylnaphthanlene 2 mn 2 6 dimethylnaphthalene 2 6 dmn and 1 np were existed in the effluent of vfcw besides the 5 kinds of pahs nap ace pyr b k f and b a p the intermediate of b k f and b a p was not detected because b k f and b a p are more stable and less biodegradable than nap ace and pyr 2 mn was the highest concentration of spahs in the effluent of vfcw fig 3b which was because nap was the most easily biodegradable among the 5 kinds of pahs previous studies also showed that 2 mn was the dominant spah in the effluent of wwtps qiao et al 2014 microalgae could achieve excellent spahs removal 99 56 100 00 which was also proved by the results of gc ms chromatogram fig s4 the cyp 450 enzyme content of microalgae was 2 82 and 1 92 times that of the microorganisms in sbr and vfcw fig s5 theoretical calculations confirmed that active sites lys69 trp96 gln397 and arg398 of cyp 450 enzyme in microalgae could interact with spahs through intermolecular hydrogen bond and π π bond sureshkumar et al 2018 hence mbpr could achieve efficient spahs removal by abundant cyp 450 enzymes sod and cat are key enzymes for stress resistance in microorganisms and plants which could remove reactive oxygen species ros such as superoxide hydrogen peroxide bhaduri and fulekar 2012 it could be obtained from fig 4 that sod and cat enzyme activities of activated sludge were significantly increased after pahs addition the existence of pahs could cause activated sludges produce more ros which induced to increase sod and cat enzyme activities to protect microorganisms themselves from stress however sod and cat enzyme activity of plants were decreased significantly after pahs addition fig 4 this might because the formation of spahs in vfcw which are more hazardous than parent pahs section 3 4 thus the increased toxicity made ros concentration too high to be regulated by antioxidant enzyme system of plants and led to oxidative stress and serious membrane damage microalgae could produce more antioxidative peptides than plants due to the high growth rate and biomass and thus very resistant to chemical stressors günerken et al 2019 li et al 2006 therefore oxidative stress was not occurred in microalgae and sod and cat enzyme activity of microalgae were improved after pahs addition fv fm also known as the maximum photochemical quantum yield of ps ii reflects the maximum photosynthetic efficiency the fv fm of plant fig 4 was decreased while microalgae showed no significant changes after the addition of pahs this result also proved that plants were under oxidative stress and influenced photosynthesis while microalgae were not be influenced which was consistent to the result of enzyme activity 3 3 pahs removal mechanisms in order to reveal the pahs removal mechanism in the bcm system mass balance of 5 kinds of pahs removal was carried out hydrolysis is a time consuming process and pahs were considered stable under environmental conditions and resistant to hydrolysis hena et al 2021 and hence the hydrolysis was not considered in this study sbr mainly relies on microbial degradation and biosorption to remove pahs while volatilization was also involved therefore pahs removal at sbr stage can be composed of microbial degradation biosorption and gas escape vfcw was subsurface flow and composed of opaque materials and thus the photolysis was also negligible lu et al 2022 hence pahs removal at vfcw stage can be composed of plant uptake substrate absorption microbial degradation and gas escape microalgae could remove pahs by microbial degradation biosorption photolysis and volatilization wang et al 2017 photolysis had little effect on pahs removals according to former analysis in this study therefore microbial degradation biosorption and gas escape were composed of the removal of pahs at mbpr stage fig 5 a shows the mass balance of 5 kinds of pahs removal at each stage which exhibited that microbial degradation was the dominant removal mechanism of lwh pahs at sbr vfcw and mbpr similar as previous studies saber et al 2021 however with the increase of molecular weight the proportion of microbial degradation gradually decreased this was because the resistance of pahs to microbial degradation increased directly with increasing molecular weight and octanol water partition coefficient zhang et al 2012 the dominant removal pathway of hwh pahs was different in different reactor biosorption was the main hwh pahs removal mechanism in sbr and mbpr while microbial degradation and substrate adsorption dominated the hwh pahs removal mechanism in vfcw microbial analysis fig s6 showed that pseudoxanthomonas and rhodococcus two important pahs degrading bacteria were obtained in both sbr and vfcw lu et al 2022 ma et al 2022 furthermore the relative abundance of pseudoxanthomonas and rhodococcus in vfcw 2 33 0 13 was higher than that of sbr 1 19 0 05 indicating that vfcw could transform more pahs by microorganisms compared with sbr because of the low value of henry coefficient h c value 2 2 10 16 4 8 10 4 the contribution ratio of hmw pahs through gas emission was zero which was similar to the results of previous report zhang et al 2012 the h c values of lwh pahs was higher 0 002 0 021 as a result the contribution ratio of gas emission of pahs is high 1 50 4 78 in addition biosorption of sbr and mbpr and substrate adsorption of vfcw were attributed to the sorption mechanism the contribution ratio of sorption was increased with the increase of molecular weight for example the adsorption contribution ratio of b k f 62 90 was higher than that of nap 32 55 fig 5b for hwh pahs the contribution ratios of adsorption microbial degradation and plant uptake were 53 69 62 90 29 52 33 69 7 58 12 62 respectively for lwh pahs the contribution ratios of adsorption microbial degradation and plant uptake were 32 56 38 41 54 99 58 01 4 42 4 93 respectively therefore adsorption dominated the hwh pahs removal while microbial degradation was the main removal mechanism for lwh pahs 3 4 dynamics of toxicity in order to explore the dynamics of toxicity in the bcm system the toxicity test of luminescent bacteria was carried out it could be seen from fig 6 a that the influent possessed high inhibition rate which was attributed to the existence of 5 kinds of pahs pahs could react with the original form of fluorescein mononucleotide fmwh2 of luciferase in luminescent bacteria to produce hydrogen thereby inactivating luciferase and showing strong luminescence inhibition thomulka et al 1993 after the treatment of the whole system the effluent luminescent bacteria inhibition rate was only 5 16 indicating the excellent guarantee of water security compared with luminescent bacteria toxicity which only reflects the cytotoxicity of non specific bacteria tang and escher 2014 genotoxicity could better characterize the degree of mutagenic and carcinogenic effects of pollutants on cells it could be seen from fig 6b that the mbpr effluent inhibition rate of sos umu genotoxicity was only 4 73 which eliminated the 94 33 inhibition rate compared with the influent this result also proved that the whole system achieved efficient genotoxicity reduction overall the whole system achieved efficient toxicity reduction and guaranteed water security notably fig 3a exhibits the teqb a p of each stage which showed teqb a p was reduced by 40 from sbr to vfcw however the luminescent bacteria inhibition rate only decreased by 11 98 and the sos umu inhibition rate increased by 5 17 instead of decrease this meant the toxicity was not solely determined by pahs it could be obtained from section 3 2 that the effluent of vfcw existed the spahs due to the biological transformation which possessed higher toxicity than corresponding pahs qiao et al 2014 therefore it was reasonable to speculate that spahs existed in the effluent of vfcw caused the surge of effluent toxicity of vfcw in addition toxicity tests also showed that spahs had a stronger influence on genotoxicity than luminescent bacteria toxicity this result implied that the effect of spahs on genotoxicity was greater than that of luminescent bacteria toxicity sos umu genotoxicity bacteria was salmonella typhimurium ta1535 psk1002 which was highly sensitive to aromatic amines and nitroaromatic hydrocarbons han et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 therefore more attentions should be paid to spahs concentrations in future studies to eliminate water genotoxicity and ensure water security pearson correlation was applied to explore the association between pahs spahs and toxicity it could be seen from fig 7 a that there was a weak correlation between b a p concentrations and the toxicity of luminescent bacteria r 0 33 table s4 as for sos umu genotoxicity fig 7b and table s5 except the b a p possessed a correlation r 0 33 with toxicity b k f also correlated r 0 51 to be noted although nap ace and pyr concentrations were higher than that of b k f and b a p in the vfcw effluent nap ace and pyr did not correlate with luminescent bacteria toxicity and sos umu genotoxicity this was because the toxicity of b k f and b a p was higher than that of nap ace and pyr which could be proved through the value of tef table s2 spah concentrations had a significant effect on toxicity based on the results of toxicity thus pahs and spahs were both used to investigate the association with toxicity fig 7c shows that the toxicity of luminescent bacteria not only possessed a weak correlation with b a p r 0 33 but also had a strong correlation with 1 np r 0 73 table s6 when considering spahs 2 mn r 0 48 and 1 np r 0 76 were both discovered to have a correlation with sos umu genotoxicity fig 7d overall there is a certain correlation between spahs and toxicity therefore the concentration of spahs must be taken into consideration in order to reasonably explain the water toxicity pyr exhibited weaker carcinogenicity than b a p however it was interesting to found that 1 np a corresponding npah of pyr had a higher correlation with luminescent bacteria toxicity r 0 73 and sos umu genotoxicity r 0 76 than that of b a p fig s7 the reason was that the presence of electronegative atoms in 1 np molecules might make them more interactive and toxic achten and andersson 2015 previous reports revealed that the mutagenicity of 1 np detected in salmonella typhimurium ta98 strain was 200 times higher than that of b a p in the absence of exogenous metabolic enzymes i e s9 rosenkranz and mermelstein 1985 additionally principal component analysis pca was utilized to further identify the main contribution factor about toxicity fig 7e and f results showed that 1 np possessed the main contribution to both luminescent bacteria toxicity and sos umu genotoxicity this also implied that 1 np was the main contribution factor about toxicity which was consistent with the result of correlation analysis to further quantify the relative contribution of pahs and spahs to toxicity a series of stepwise regression models were developed and applied in this study 5 kinds of pahs nap ace pyr b k f and b a p and 3 kinds of spahs 2 mn 2 6 dmn and 1 np were used as variables to associate with toxicity luminescent bacteria toxicity and sos umu genotoxicity it could be seen from table 1 that the stepwise regression model between toxicity and pahs concentration was established in eqs 3 and 6 however when only 5 kinds of pahs concentrations were considered the luminescent bacterial toxicity and sos umu genotoxicity fitted poorly with r2 equals 0 31 and 0 46 respectively low r2 value resulted in a lack of rational explanation for these two equations which was needed to reexamine stepwise regression analysis in further stepwise regression analyses spah concentrations were added to improve the associations between toxicity and pahs and spahs eqs 5 and 8 revealed the stepwise regression model between toxicity and pahs and spahs it could be obtained that the luminescent bacterial toxicity and sos umu genotoxicity fitted well when considering the spah concentrations with r2 equals 0 90 and 0 98 respectively the value of r2 was significantly improved compared with the equations that only considered pahs which suggested that toxicity could be reasonably explained when in view of spahs therefore the concentration of spahs particularly the concentration of 1 np should be paid attention to ensure water quality safety besides pahs to the best of our knowledge previous studies just unilaterally considered changes of spah concentration and toxicity and the quantitative contribution of pahs and spahs to toxicity has not been thoroughly discussed or explored 4 conclusions this study investigated the occurrence and fate of pahs in a novel bcm wastewater treatment system satisfactory nitrogen and phosphorous removal were achieved and more importantly the pahs removal efficiency could reach 90 58 97 50 microbial biodegradation was the main pathway to remove lwh pahs while adsorption dominated the removal of hwh pahs spahs i e 2 mn 2 6 dmn and 1 np appeared in the effluent of vfcw due to microbial degradation which led to increased toxicity of vfcw effluent especially the genotoxicity the toxicity of vfcw effluent was significantly reduced after the effective biosorption and biodegradation of spahs by mbpr furthermore correlation and stepwise regression analyses showed that both pahs and spahs should be taken into consideration to ensure the water quality safety and special attention should be paid to 1 np which was strongly associated with toxicity dynamics during wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

15604,in this study a novel wastewater treatment process combining sequencing batch reactor constructed wetland and microalgal membrane photobioreactor bcm process was proposed and its performance on removal transformation and toxicity reduction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs was intensively explored satisfactory pahs removal 90 58 97 50 was achieved and molecular weight had significant impact on the removal pathways of different pahs adsorption dominated the removal of high molecular weight pahs while the contribution ratio of microbial degradation increased with the decrease of molecular weight of pahs more importantly it was reported for the first time that substituted pahs spahs produced by microbial degradation of pahs would lead to increased toxicity during the bcm process high pahs 75 37 88 52 and spahs removal 99 56 100 00 were achieved in the microalgae unit due to its abundant cytochrome p450 enzyme which decreased the bacterial toxicity by 90 93 and genotoxicity by 93 08 indicating that microalgae played significance important role in ensuring water security in addition the high quantitative relationship r2 0 98 between pahs spahs and toxicity exhibited by regression model analysis proved that more attention should be paid to the ecotoxicity of derivatives of refractory organic matters in wastewater treatment plants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons wastewater treatment ecotoxicity water quality security data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction in recent years the hybrid system that combines biological treatment and constructed wetlands has been regarded as a promising technology and widely used in domestic wastewater due to its low operation cost and consistent effluent quality nas et al 2020 wan et al 2019 however existing studies only focus on conventional pollutants such as nitrogen and phosphorous wang and tian 2021 and little attention have been paid to the removal of emerging trace pollutants which played a more important role in the wastewater toxicity than conventional pollutants maletic et al 2019 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs which are mainly produced by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and organic matters are typical emerging trace pollutants because of its significant mutagenesis carcinogenicity and toxicity lu et al 2022 as reported previously plentiful pahs 400 7200 ng l existed in the domestic wastewater of china sun et al 2018 however pahs are difficult to be degraded in wastewater treatment plants wwtps due to its hydrophobicity and stable property it was reported that the removal efficiency of pahs in secondary treatment of traditional wwtps was 45 82 qiao et al 2017 therefore it is critical to improve pahs removal efficiency of domestic wastewater with the growing concern about water security and increasing demand of wastewater reuse derivatives and hazards produced during biological or ecological treatment of refractory organic pollutants such as pahs have been the focus of research in recent years zhang et al 2022 substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons spahs such as nitrated pahs npahs were reported to be generated due to the microbial transformation process and have received widespread attention due to their relatively high toxicity in comparison to their corresponding pahs zhao et al 2019 for example previous studies found that 1 nitropyrene 1 np a typical npah possessed higher carcinogenicity and genotoxicity than their parent pahs due to the presence of nitro groups alves et al 2016 bandowe and meusel 2017 spahs were widespread in the effluent of wwtps 126 15 2 ng l due to the microbial transformation of pahs qiao et al 2014 which implied that the effluent of wwtps possessed the risk of increased toxicity recently physicochemical techniques such as advanced oxidation have been utilized to remove spahs forsey et al 2010 however the problem of high operation cost limited their practical application thus it is important to improve biological and ecological combination process so as to reduce the effluent toxicity and ensure water security microalgae have promising application potential in wastewater treatment because of their higher nutrients demand during biomass growth when compared with heterotrophic bacteria and the production of high value products liu et al 2021a previous studies found that microalgal membrane photobioreactor mbpr was a feasible technology to treat wastewater which could achieve excellent performance for removal of nitrogen 96 and phosphorus 85 through assimilation of microalgae lee et al 2018 in addition microalgae also have unique advantages in removing refractory organic matters and their derivatives hena et al 2021 nguyen et al 2021 the cytochrome p450 enzyme cyp 450 of microalgae could convert refractory organic matters and their derivatives into hydrophilic compounds through inserting pro electronics group e g cooh and then the hydrophilic compounds could be further transformed to less toxic compounds by electrophilic addition and epoxidation zhou et al 2022 recently it has been proved that microalgae could achieve 100 b a p removal and 99 8 1 methylphenanthrene removal through microbial degradation and biosorption garcía de llasera et al 2016 luo et al 2020 therefore it is promising to integrate microalgal technology to wastewater treatment process to reduce the effluent toxicity of wastewater treatment process and ensure water security in this study a novel biological constructed wetland microalgal wastewater treatment system bcm system was established for efficient pahs removal to ensure the effluent security the purpose of this study was 1 to investigate the potential removal of nutrients and pahs in the bcm system 2 to elucidate the pahs transformation and dynamic of toxicity in the bcm system 3 to illustrate the mechanism of pah risk prevention and control in the bcm system through stoichiometric analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment system configuration two parallel bcm systems each composed of sequencing batch reactor sbr followed by vertical flow constructed wetland vfcw and microalgal membrane photobioreactor mbpr were built at shandong university qingdao china fig 1 indicates the schematic diagram of the system the sbr possessed a working volume of 4 l and had a diameter of 10 cm and a height of 60 cm a sludge outlet was positioned at the bottom of the reactor and an effluent outlet was constructed at 25 cm height from the bottom of the reactor the lab scale vfcw located behind the sbr was 32 cm in diameter and 70 cm in height vfcw was filled with three substrate layers which consisted of bottom layer of 5 cm quartz sand 1 3 cm in diameter as the supporting layer middle layer of 50 cm zeolite 4 8 mm in diameter and a surface layer of 5 cm washed sand 1 mm in diameter a vertically perforated pvc pipe was inserted into the vfcw in order to measure various physical and chemical parameters in situ iris pseudacorus was chosen as the plant species of vfcw and was planted at a density of 100 rhizomes m2 mbpr was the final process of bcm system which was 15 cm in diameter and 40 cm in height chlorella vulgaris was selected as algae species a membrane module consisting polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf hollow fiber membranes with a pore size of 0 04 μm was added based on luo et al 2018 a magnetic stirrer was prepared below the device to mix microalgae culture to boost the growth of microalgae 2 2 operation of experiment system the total experimental period was divided into two periods i e start up and stabilized period the domestication and culture process for the plants and microorganisms was performed for approximately one month during the start up period the synthetic wastewater was prepared in a storage tank 80 l and introduced into the sbr using a peristaltic pump during the whole experiment period sbr was operated at a volumetric exchange ratio of 50 with a cycle of 4 h resulting in a hydraulic retention time hrt of 8 h the procedure of each cycle was consisted of 30 min for filling 120 min for aeration to maintain dissolved oxygen do concentration at 0 5 1 0 mg l 30 min for settling and 30 min for discharging effluent the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss of the sbr was maintained at 2500 3000 mg l and the ph of the sbr was 7 0 8 0 afterward the effluent of sbr was induced into a settling tank and then pumped continuously into the vfcw at hrt of 2 days the effluent of vfcw was then routed into the mbpr and finally pumped out from hollow fiber membranes through a pump the initial microalgae density of mbpr was 5 105 cells ml and mpbr was illuminated by fluorescence lamps that caused average light intensity on mpbr surface was approximately 85 μmol m2s the hrt of mbpr was 2 days luo et al 2018 microalgae was drained periodically to maintain the algal density at 106 cells ml in mbpr and sludge retention time srt of mbpr was 18 days due to the growth of microalgae the ph of mbpr was slightly alkaline ph 8 0 9 5 the synthetic wastewater per liter was consisted of sucrose 267 38 mg nh4 2so4 169 75 mg and kh2po4 21 97 mg to create a concentration of organic matter cod of 300 mg l ammonia nitrogen nh4 n of 40 mg l and total phosphorus tp of 5 mg l additionally 1 ml trace element table s1 was added per liter wastewater in order to better simulate the actual wastewater situation and to more realistically evaluate the effectiveness of the technology a mixture of several pahs including naphthalene nap acenaphthene ace pyrene pyr benzo k fluoranthene b k f and benzo a pyrene b a p was selected in this study as targeted pollutants referring to previously reported pahs concentration in wwtps fatone et al 2011 qiao et al 2014 the concentration of 5 kinds of pahs was determined as nap 0 63 μg l ace 0 28 μg l pyr 0 11 μg l b k f 0 08 μg l b a p 0 06 μg l the detailed information about physical and chemical properties of pahs are shown in table s2 2 3 sampling and analysis 2 3 1 physicochemical parameters the influent and effluent of sbr vfcw and mbpr were collected every 2 days and then filtered by 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane with syringe cod nh4 n nitrate no3 n nitrite no2 n total nitrogen tn and tp concentrations were determined based on the standard methods apha 2012 immediately after sampling all samples were measured in triplicate do ph meter hq 40d hach usa was utilized in situ to measure the do concentration and ph 2 3 2 pahs and spahs measurement the effluent from sbr vfcw and mbpr was sampled every 4 days to measure the concentration of pahs and spahs pahs in water samples were extracted by solid phase extraction dichloromethane methanol and ultrapure water were added successively to realize the activation of c18 extraction membrane liu et al 2021b water samples 200 ml with surrogate p terphenyl d14 and 2 fluobiphenyl were passed through a c18 extraction membrane using a solid phase extractor extrapid then the organic phase was eluted with dichloromethane for 20 min and concentrated to 1 ml by automatic parallel concentrator lab tech china for further determination polyurethane foam puf was utilized to measure the pahs concentration in the gas sample produced by each reactor puf was first pre cleaned by soaking in dichloromethane and then was extracted by using dichloromethane and hexane saber et al 2021 finally the extracted organic phase was concentrated to 1 ml for measurement sludge and microalgae samples 50 ml were collected during the operation period in polytetrafluoroethylene tube and freeze dried for 48 h afterward dichloromethane 50 ml was added and placed in an ultrasonic water bath to shake for 1 h before being concentrated to 1 ml for measurement plant and substrate samples were sampled after the experiment and then washed and freeze dried 48 h before being measured the further detection method of pahs concentration in the substrate and plant was based on kang et al 2019 pahs and spahs concentrations were quantified by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms shimadzu japan qp2020 under selected ion monitor sim mode with the internal standard method the internal standard was decachlorobiphenyl and surrogate were p terphenyl d14 and 2 fluobiphenyl the comprehensive detection procedure and method was described in qiao et al 2013 the concentration of pahs and spahs measured in all samples were higher than limits of quantification loq and the detection method could achieve excellent recovery for pahs and spahs and ensure the accuracy of experimental data detailed in supporting information content s1 mass balance was used to evaluate the removal capability and removal mechanism of the whole system for pahs which was carried out by using the concentration of pahs detected in water substrates plants sludges microalgae and gas samples the detailed mass balance calculation was shown in the supporting information content s2 2 3 3 physiological indicators before and after the experiment the activated sludge plant and microalgae were sampled the stress level of sludge plant and microalgae was evaluated by the measurement of antioxidant enzyme sod and cat activity the detailed measurement method was described in carias et al 2008 feng et al 2022 the maximum fluorescence of photosystem ii fv fm was measured by the chlorophyll fluorescence instrument walz junior pam germany additionally the cyp 450 enzyme concentration was measured based on previous studies ning and wang 2012 2 3 4 toxicity assays toxicity of the effluent from sbr vfcw and mbpr was measured every 4 days after adding pahs by v fischeri nrrl b 1177 sredlova et al 2020 the bacterial suspension 20 μl was added to 180 μl samples and bioluminescence inhibition was measured after exposure for 15 min the mixture of 3 sodium chloride solution and bacterial solution was used as a negative control the relative intensity of the luminescence in samples r and negative control r0 was measured to calculate the potential luminescence inhibition i of the water samples according to eq 1 1 i r 0 r r 0 in order to evaluate the genotoxicity of water samples sos umu tests were performed using salmonella typhimurium ta1535 psk1002 without s9 activation 4 nitroquinoline n oxide 4 nqo and 1 dmso were set as a positive and negative control in the sos umu test respectively tang et al 2020 the absorbance at 420 nm and 600 nm was measured using a microplate meter to calculate the ir of the water sample which was based on previous reports zhang et al 2017 in addition to determine the carcinogenic potential of pah the toxic equivalent concentration teqb a p of 5 pahs was calculated based on its toxicity relative to b a p using the relative toxic equivalent factor tef described by berardi et al 2019 the calculation equation was based on the eq 2 2 te q b a p c tef where c depicts the concentration of each pah μg l and the tef represents the toxic equivalency factor for each compound table s2 2 3 5 microbial analysis to assess the microbial community of sbr and vfcw activated sludges and substrate samples were collected at the end of the experiment and analyzed with illumina high throughput sequencing analysis conducted by novogene co ltd beijing china the detailed procedures are illustrated in the supporting information content s3 2 3 6 statistical analyses pearson correlation coefficients and stepwise regression models were calculated to evaluate the relationship and quantitative response relationships between toxicity and pahs and spahs concentration using spss statistics 25 0 when the p value was less than 0 05 significant data difference was considered 3 results and discussion 3 1 pollutants removal performance the overall pollutant performance cod nh4 n tn and tp in the bcm system is shown in fig 2 the effluent cod concentration of sbr vfcw and mbpr was 106 34 9 87 22 95 3 05 mg l and 10 69 1 37 mg l respectively fig 2a organics were removed efficiently by substrate adsorption and microbial degradation in vfcw the results of eem fig s1 revealed that the easily biodegradable organic matter was efficiently removed after the treatment of vfcw and the effluent of vfcw showed poorer biodegradability than that of sbr detailed in supporting information content s4 microalgae were autotrophic organisms and their organics removal mechanism was differed from that of bacteria microalgae could remove organics through assimilation and biosorption rather than microbial degradation abdel raouf et al 2012 al jabri et al 2021 therefore mbpr could further remove the refractory organic matter and then decrease the cod the whole system achieved efficient removal of organic matters due to the microbial degradation by microorganism and assimilation by microalgae in terms of nh4 n the nh4 n removal efficiency of sbr was only 41 49 7 47 which was lower than other studies 71 20 85 70 cai et al 2022 it could be calculated that ammonia oxidation rate was 0 91 1 33 mg nh4 n g mlss 1 h 1 which was also lower than previous studies 5 28 to 18 25 mg nh4 n g mlss 1 h 1 shao et al 2017 nitrification was an aerobic process which was generally believed that could be occurred smoothly when do concentration was greater than 1 5 mg l lu et al 2020 however do concentration was controlled at 0 5 1 0 mg l in sbr of the present study therefore nitrification was inhibited and thus led to the restricted nh4 removal in sbr nh4 n was effectively removed in vfcw and the effluent nh4 n was 7 87 1 42 mg l zeolite in the substrate could remove nh4 n from wastewater by adsorption and cation exchange han et al 2019 more importantly zeolite with high ion exchange and adsorption capacity improves the adhesion of nh4 n to substrate microbial membrane and further enhances the nitrification he et al 2017 thus vfcw possessed excellent nh4 n removal efficiency throughout the experimental period no2 and no3 were below 0 1 mg l in sbr and mbpr with no obvious fluctuation and the effluent no2 and no3 of vfcw were enhanced due to improved ammonia nitrogen oxidation fig s2 as shown in fig 2c the effluent tn of the vfcw and mbpr was 9 80 1 08 mg l and 1 15 0 23 mg l respectively in addition the effluent tp concentrations of vfcw and mbpr was 1 11 0 16 mg l and 0 05 0 01 mg l respectively it could be noted that mbpr performed excellent tn and tp removal which was also reported by wang et al 2015 and sukacova et al 2015 based on the previous analysis of eem the effluent of vfcw was mainly refractory organic matters that are difficult for microorganism to utilize additionally the average cod concentration was low 22 95 mg l making physicochemical removal uneconomical microalgae could mainly rely on assimilation rather than microbial degradation to achieve efficient nitrogen and phosphorus removal even if the influent cod concentration was low and was mainly composed of refractory organic matters abdel raouf et al 2012 previous studies also reported that microalgae could reach uptake capacities of 1 0 g n m 2 d 1 and 0 13 g p m 2 d 1 even without organic sources boelee et al 2011 therefore it is economical and effective to remove nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater using microalgae even when carbon sources are scarce and low bioavailability which is promising in the wastewater treatment 3 2 pahs removal and transformation fig 3 a shows the effluent concentration of five kinds of pahs at each stage of the bcm system specifically it could be obtained from fig 3a that the combined sbr and vfcw stage mainly achieved efficient degradation of low molecular weight lwh pahs nap ace pyr 60 60 82 61 however the removal efficiency of hwh pahs b k f and b a p was lower 51 63 55 60 previous studies also proved that the removal of lwh pahs 78 16 3 13 was higher than that of hwh 45 06 10 81 in the biological treatment zhou et al 2022 this was because hwh pahs possessed higher hydrophobicity and stability than lwh pahs which was difficult for the biodegradation specifically the removal efficiency of b a p in sbr was only 9 92 this was because b a p tended to retain their conjugated ring systems and was difficult to be biodegraded zhao et al 2019 also reported that the sbr only possessed 8 68 removal efficiency of hwh pahs mbpr showed excellent pahs removal especially the hwh pahs 64 82 73 59 this was not only because the presence of sbr and vfcw reduced the pollution load of pahs laying the foundation for mbpr to efficiently degrade pahs but more importantly microalgae could efficiently degrade hwh pahs through microbial degradation and biosorption which was also proved by previous study garcia de llasera et al 2016 the influent of mbpr with or without light during the hrt 2d was explored and no significant difference in pahs removal was obtained fig s3 hence photolysis was considered to be neglectable in pahs removal in this study similar phenomenon has also been reported in previous studies nguyen et al 2021 xiong et al 2017 to sum up the whole system obtained efficient removal 90 58 97 50 of 5 kinds of pahs as previously reported the removal efficiency of pahs was only 72 after the treatment of wwtps ozaki et al 2015 which was lower than the removal efficiency reported in this study these results demonstrated that bcm process achieves better pahs removal efficiency and has promising prospect in the engineering application the results of gc ms chromatogram fig s4 showed that 2 methylnaphthanlene 2 mn 2 6 dimethylnaphthalene 2 6 dmn and 1 np were existed in the effluent of vfcw besides the 5 kinds of pahs nap ace pyr b k f and b a p the intermediate of b k f and b a p was not detected because b k f and b a p are more stable and less biodegradable than nap ace and pyr 2 mn was the highest concentration of spahs in the effluent of vfcw fig 3b which was because nap was the most easily biodegradable among the 5 kinds of pahs previous studies also showed that 2 mn was the dominant spah in the effluent of wwtps qiao et al 2014 microalgae could achieve excellent spahs removal 99 56 100 00 which was also proved by the results of gc ms chromatogram fig s4 the cyp 450 enzyme content of microalgae was 2 82 and 1 92 times that of the microorganisms in sbr and vfcw fig s5 theoretical calculations confirmed that active sites lys69 trp96 gln397 and arg398 of cyp 450 enzyme in microalgae could interact with spahs through intermolecular hydrogen bond and π π bond sureshkumar et al 2018 hence mbpr could achieve efficient spahs removal by abundant cyp 450 enzymes sod and cat are key enzymes for stress resistance in microorganisms and plants which could remove reactive oxygen species ros such as superoxide hydrogen peroxide bhaduri and fulekar 2012 it could be obtained from fig 4 that sod and cat enzyme activities of activated sludge were significantly increased after pahs addition the existence of pahs could cause activated sludges produce more ros which induced to increase sod and cat enzyme activities to protect microorganisms themselves from stress however sod and cat enzyme activity of plants were decreased significantly after pahs addition fig 4 this might because the formation of spahs in vfcw which are more hazardous than parent pahs section 3 4 thus the increased toxicity made ros concentration too high to be regulated by antioxidant enzyme system of plants and led to oxidative stress and serious membrane damage microalgae could produce more antioxidative peptides than plants due to the high growth rate and biomass and thus very resistant to chemical stressors günerken et al 2019 li et al 2006 therefore oxidative stress was not occurred in microalgae and sod and cat enzyme activity of microalgae were improved after pahs addition fv fm also known as the maximum photochemical quantum yield of ps ii reflects the maximum photosynthetic efficiency the fv fm of plant fig 4 was decreased while microalgae showed no significant changes after the addition of pahs this result also proved that plants were under oxidative stress and influenced photosynthesis while microalgae were not be influenced which was consistent to the result of enzyme activity 3 3 pahs removal mechanisms in order to reveal the pahs removal mechanism in the bcm system mass balance of 5 kinds of pahs removal was carried out hydrolysis is a time consuming process and pahs were considered stable under environmental conditions and resistant to hydrolysis hena et al 2021 and hence the hydrolysis was not considered in this study sbr mainly relies on microbial degradation and biosorption to remove pahs while volatilization was also involved therefore pahs removal at sbr stage can be composed of microbial degradation biosorption and gas escape vfcw was subsurface flow and composed of opaque materials and thus the photolysis was also negligible lu et al 2022 hence pahs removal at vfcw stage can be composed of plant uptake substrate absorption microbial degradation and gas escape microalgae could remove pahs by microbial degradation biosorption photolysis and volatilization wang et al 2017 photolysis had little effect on pahs removals according to former analysis in this study therefore microbial degradation biosorption and gas escape were composed of the removal of pahs at mbpr stage fig 5 a shows the mass balance of 5 kinds of pahs removal at each stage which exhibited that microbial degradation was the dominant removal mechanism of lwh pahs at sbr vfcw and mbpr similar as previous studies saber et al 2021 however with the increase of molecular weight the proportion of microbial degradation gradually decreased this was because the resistance of pahs to microbial degradation increased directly with increasing molecular weight and octanol water partition coefficient zhang et al 2012 the dominant removal pathway of hwh pahs was different in different reactor biosorption was the main hwh pahs removal mechanism in sbr and mbpr while microbial degradation and substrate adsorption dominated the hwh pahs removal mechanism in vfcw microbial analysis fig s6 showed that pseudoxanthomonas and rhodococcus two important pahs degrading bacteria were obtained in both sbr and vfcw lu et al 2022 ma et al 2022 furthermore the relative abundance of pseudoxanthomonas and rhodococcus in vfcw 2 33 0 13 was higher than that of sbr 1 19 0 05 indicating that vfcw could transform more pahs by microorganisms compared with sbr because of the low value of henry coefficient h c value 2 2 10 16 4 8 10 4 the contribution ratio of hmw pahs through gas emission was zero which was similar to the results of previous report zhang et al 2012 the h c values of lwh pahs was higher 0 002 0 021 as a result the contribution ratio of gas emission of pahs is high 1 50 4 78 in addition biosorption of sbr and mbpr and substrate adsorption of vfcw were attributed to the sorption mechanism the contribution ratio of sorption was increased with the increase of molecular weight for example the adsorption contribution ratio of b k f 62 90 was higher than that of nap 32 55 fig 5b for hwh pahs the contribution ratios of adsorption microbial degradation and plant uptake were 53 69 62 90 29 52 33 69 7 58 12 62 respectively for lwh pahs the contribution ratios of adsorption microbial degradation and plant uptake were 32 56 38 41 54 99 58 01 4 42 4 93 respectively therefore adsorption dominated the hwh pahs removal while microbial degradation was the main removal mechanism for lwh pahs 3 4 dynamics of toxicity in order to explore the dynamics of toxicity in the bcm system the toxicity test of luminescent bacteria was carried out it could be seen from fig 6 a that the influent possessed high inhibition rate which was attributed to the existence of 5 kinds of pahs pahs could react with the original form of fluorescein mononucleotide fmwh2 of luciferase in luminescent bacteria to produce hydrogen thereby inactivating luciferase and showing strong luminescence inhibition thomulka et al 1993 after the treatment of the whole system the effluent luminescent bacteria inhibition rate was only 5 16 indicating the excellent guarantee of water security compared with luminescent bacteria toxicity which only reflects the cytotoxicity of non specific bacteria tang and escher 2014 genotoxicity could better characterize the degree of mutagenic and carcinogenic effects of pollutants on cells it could be seen from fig 6b that the mbpr effluent inhibition rate of sos umu genotoxicity was only 4 73 which eliminated the 94 33 inhibition rate compared with the influent this result also proved that the whole system achieved efficient genotoxicity reduction overall the whole system achieved efficient toxicity reduction and guaranteed water security notably fig 3a exhibits the teqb a p of each stage which showed teqb a p was reduced by 40 from sbr to vfcw however the luminescent bacteria inhibition rate only decreased by 11 98 and the sos umu inhibition rate increased by 5 17 instead of decrease this meant the toxicity was not solely determined by pahs it could be obtained from section 3 2 that the effluent of vfcw existed the spahs due to the biological transformation which possessed higher toxicity than corresponding pahs qiao et al 2014 therefore it was reasonable to speculate that spahs existed in the effluent of vfcw caused the surge of effluent toxicity of vfcw in addition toxicity tests also showed that spahs had a stronger influence on genotoxicity than luminescent bacteria toxicity this result implied that the effect of spahs on genotoxicity was greater than that of luminescent bacteria toxicity sos umu genotoxicity bacteria was salmonella typhimurium ta1535 psk1002 which was highly sensitive to aromatic amines and nitroaromatic hydrocarbons han et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 therefore more attentions should be paid to spahs concentrations in future studies to eliminate water genotoxicity and ensure water security pearson correlation was applied to explore the association between pahs spahs and toxicity it could be seen from fig 7 a that there was a weak correlation between b a p concentrations and the toxicity of luminescent bacteria r 0 33 table s4 as for sos umu genotoxicity fig 7b and table s5 except the b a p possessed a correlation r 0 33 with toxicity b k f also correlated r 0 51 to be noted although nap ace and pyr concentrations were higher than that of b k f and b a p in the vfcw effluent nap ace and pyr did not correlate with luminescent bacteria toxicity and sos umu genotoxicity this was because the toxicity of b k f and b a p was higher than that of nap ace and pyr which could be proved through the value of tef table s2 spah concentrations had a significant effect on toxicity based on the results of toxicity thus pahs and spahs were both used to investigate the association with toxicity fig 7c shows that the toxicity of luminescent bacteria not only possessed a weak correlation with b a p r 0 33 but also had a strong correlation with 1 np r 0 73 table s6 when considering spahs 2 mn r 0 48 and 1 np r 0 76 were both discovered to have a correlation with sos umu genotoxicity fig 7d overall there is a certain correlation between spahs and toxicity therefore the concentration of spahs must be taken into consideration in order to reasonably explain the water toxicity pyr exhibited weaker carcinogenicity than b a p however it was interesting to found that 1 np a corresponding npah of pyr had a higher correlation with luminescent bacteria toxicity r 0 73 and sos umu genotoxicity r 0 76 than that of b a p fig s7 the reason was that the presence of electronegative atoms in 1 np molecules might make them more interactive and toxic achten and andersson 2015 previous reports revealed that the mutagenicity of 1 np detected in salmonella typhimurium ta98 strain was 200 times higher than that of b a p in the absence of exogenous metabolic enzymes i e s9 rosenkranz and mermelstein 1985 additionally principal component analysis pca was utilized to further identify the main contribution factor about toxicity fig 7e and f results showed that 1 np possessed the main contribution to both luminescent bacteria toxicity and sos umu genotoxicity this also implied that 1 np was the main contribution factor about toxicity which was consistent with the result of correlation analysis to further quantify the relative contribution of pahs and spahs to toxicity a series of stepwise regression models were developed and applied in this study 5 kinds of pahs nap ace pyr b k f and b a p and 3 kinds of spahs 2 mn 2 6 dmn and 1 np were used as variables to associate with toxicity luminescent bacteria toxicity and sos umu genotoxicity it could be seen from table 1 that the stepwise regression model between toxicity and pahs concentration was established in eqs 3 and 6 however when only 5 kinds of pahs concentrations were considered the luminescent bacterial toxicity and sos umu genotoxicity fitted poorly with r2 equals 0 31 and 0 46 respectively low r2 value resulted in a lack of rational explanation for these two equations which was needed to reexamine stepwise regression analysis in further stepwise regression analyses spah concentrations were added to improve the associations between toxicity and pahs and spahs eqs 5 and 8 revealed the stepwise regression model between toxicity and pahs and spahs it could be obtained that the luminescent bacterial toxicity and sos umu genotoxicity fitted well when considering the spah concentrations with r2 equals 0 90 and 0 98 respectively the value of r2 was significantly improved compared with the equations that only considered pahs which suggested that toxicity could be reasonably explained when in view of spahs therefore the concentration of spahs particularly the concentration of 1 np should be paid attention to ensure water quality safety besides pahs to the best of our knowledge previous studies just unilaterally considered changes of spah concentration and toxicity and the quantitative contribution of pahs and spahs to toxicity has not been thoroughly discussed or explored 4 conclusions this study investigated the occurrence and fate of pahs in a novel bcm wastewater treatment system satisfactory nitrogen and phosphorous removal were achieved and more importantly the pahs removal efficiency could reach 90 58 97 50 microbial biodegradation was the main pathway to remove lwh pahs while adsorption dominated the removal of hwh pahs spahs i e 2 mn 2 6 dmn and 1 np appeared in the effluent of vfcw due to microbial degradation which led to increased toxicity of vfcw effluent especially the genotoxicity the toxicity of vfcw effluent was significantly reduced after the effective biosorption and biodegradation of spahs by mbpr furthermore correlation and stepwise regression analyses showed that both pahs and spahs should be taken into consideration to ensure the water quality safety and special attention should be paid to 1 np which was strongly associated with toxicity dynamics during wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or
