study region the marqués de comillas region mdc 16 54 n 92 05 w southeast mexico fig 1 covers an area of 2008 km2 average annual precipitation is about 3000 mm with a three month dry season february april less than 60 mm month 1 and with an average monthly temperature of 22 c martínez ramos et al 2009 before 1970 mdc was completely covered by old growth forest later mdc was part of the mexican federal government s land distribution program tarrío garcía and concheiro bórquez 2006 the region experienced immigration from different states of mexico many groups of peasants and indigenous people from different states and also from guatemala de vos and marion 2015 arrived to start or continue their farming activities they were grouped into ejidos communities with a relative degree of institutional organization alcorn and toledo 1995 federal incentives during the 1970s 80 s promoted cattle pastures and staple crops and more recently palm oil production carabias et al 2015 currently 70 of the region is covered livestock pastures crop fields such as maize bean chili palm oil plantations and patches of secondary and old growth forest zermeño hernández et al 2016 however given that the ejidos are mostly constituted by people with the same place of origin and are therefore rather homogeneous the differences between ejidos are large and are reflected in the different agricultural production characteristics associated with the customs of the inhabitants berget et al 2021 lohbeck et al 2022 wies et al 2022 2 2 interviews and farming systems characterization sixty two interviews were conducted in the mdc in five ejidos with different origin groups at least eleven interviews were conducted in each ejido representing more than 9 of the total number of farmers in the sample and 9 5 of the total area of the ejidos to characterize the tfs we designed a semi structured interview aiming to describe the whole farm land uses and the main drivers and farm functioning incurred the most frequent land uses on the farms were maize cropping cattle ranching and remaining forest areas followed by bean palm oil and maize cropping for silage fig s1 and table s1 for each crop we asked about the main drivers behind inputs and outputs when we visited the farmers and carried out interviews we toured the countryside together with the farmer while asking the questions this tour served us to visually check the information they provided and to georeference the vertices of the farm to check the extents they indicated 2 2 1 model based farm construction for each community we modelled a typical farm first we counted current activities in farms grouped into ejido we considered activities practiced by five or more farmers supplementary material fig s1 land uses for each typical farm are shown in table s1 inputs outputs and management decisions for land uses are detailed in figure s2 for cattle production we collected data pertaining to herd structure meat production body weight dry matter intake dmi labor input and sanitary and reproductive management for the cropping activity we collected inputs seeds fertilizers herbicides and insecticides and outputs grain or fruit yields and estimated manure also we registered forage species and utilization to estimate grass productivity and labor costs subsidies and allocation for cattle production parameters to estimate dmi capacity metabolizable energy me and crude protein cp requirements per animal type in the herd were obtained from nrc standards nrc 2001 nutrient requirements for maintenance growth and meat production were obtained from nrc 2001 as well 2 3 data analysis 2 3 1 description of the model we used the farmdesign model to explore trade offs or synergies between optimization objectives as influenced by management choices about areas of agricultural land uses and conservation areas and amounts of inputs like agrochemicals and external feed for livestock farmdesign algorithm uses a pareto based version of the evolutionary algorithm of differential evolution de storn and price 1997 the de algorithm generates two populations of solutions which represent the decision variables that indicate the management choices the opportunity space created by these populations is diverse the variety in the decision variables genotypes creates diversity in landscape performance that is measured by the indicators phenotypes the first population of parents serves as the result set that is iteratively improved while the second population consists of competitors that are generated by uniform cross over of three selected parent solutions in each iteration the parameters of the de algorithm are the probability of cross over cr 0 85 and the amplitude of mutation f 0 15 each population consisted of 1000 solutions the solutions in both populations are ranked using the principle of pareto optimality groot et al 2012 and the euclidean distance between the solutions in the opportunity space is calculated from the normalized indicator values which serves to quantify a crowding metric the pareto principle allows to evaluate all objectives simultaneously without weighing groot and rossing 2011 after the ranking the selection process is conducted by pairwise comparison solutions in the result set population are replaced by individuals from the competitor population if the latter has a better pareto rank or is positioned in a less crowded part of the opportunity space the rank based selection results in movement of the parent population in the direction of the trade off frontier or surface while the crowd based selection ensures spread along the frontier or surface this process was conducted for 1000 iterations the model requires information to describe the biophysical environment socioeconomics production costs of activities and labor type and crop products agronomic inputs and outputs herd composition and products production costs and outputs manure types and degradation rates external sources of mineral nutrients through animal food or fertilizers and physical assets a static farm balance model calculates a large range of indicators pertaining to nutrient and organic matter flows and balances herd feed consumption and energy and protein balance manure balance labor balance and economic results the model can be downloaded freely from https fse models gitlab io compass farmdesign we considered the amount of inputs and the agricultural and conservation areas as decision variables for exploration decision variables must be set within coherent ranges also land use area constraints must be set for farm functioning i e land use areas cannot exceed the farm size model outcomes can serve as objectives that can be either minimized or maximized 2 3 2 decision variables we considered decision variables for crops including pastures for cattle and forest areas and agrochemicals amounts fertilizers and pesticides moreover we added decision variables to modify the destination of products such as maize grain from crop to animal feed or self consumption table 1 2 3 3 constraints and objectives adjustments in decision variables lead to changes in model outcomes outcomes can be selected as constraints that should be within a given range or as objectives that can be minimized or maximized important constraints relate to the feed balance the deviation between demand and supply of energy and protein should be within narrow ranges to allow the production levels to be defined by animal numbers and corresponding productivity moreover the dry matter dm supply to the animals cannot exceed the intake capacity another important constraint was the maximum conservation area which could not exceed the total farming area minimum area for maize and beans required for self consumption was also specified an overview of selected constraints and their allowed ranges for the farm in la victoria is presented in table 1 see variables and constraints information of completing farms in table s3 finally we selected six common objectives for the five farms following the research question of the study the main objectives were to maximize economic profits considered as an integrator of total agricultural production and conservation forest areas then agricultural production had to include sustainable intensification practices as alternative managements that would allow for an easier transition to improved smallholders farming systems the common objectives for all tfs were maximizing economic profits maximizing forest conservation areas maximizing feed protein self supply maximizing land use evenness minimizing agrochemical use herbicides insecticides minimizing variable costs for analyzing the initial farm situations and those optimized in the conservation production trade off frontier we categorized farms according to their potential to improve their initial situations in the solutions plot of the maximization of forest areas and economic profits figs 1k 2k s3k s4k s5k we considered the visual euclidean distance between the coordinates position of the initial status black triangle and one situation which improved both conservation and production chosen from the improved solution frontier red diamond we tagged farms with low potential to those with short distances sj and lv and farms with high potential to those with large distance qu zpo and ra 2 4 statistical analyses and software we used r software http www r project org and rstudio http www rstudio com interface for data analysis in particular we performed principal component analysis with factominer package lê et al 2008 to identify associations between optimization objectives and decision variables then we plotted correlation graphs with ggplot2 package wickham et al 2019 3 results 3 1 trade offs and synergies objectives exploration and farm configuration associated drivers figs 1 and 2 show the relations between the six objectives for the san jose sj low income and la victoria lv high income farms the principal component analyses fig 3 indicate the relations between decision variables and objectives in sj solutions yielded a trade off between forest conservation and economic profits figs 1k and 3a the latter was driven by larger maize areas associated to higher pesticides use figs 1g and 3a moreover there was a synergetic relation between minimizing variable costs driven by the pollinasa external feed figs 1a and 3a and maximizing protein self supply which was associated to an increase in pasture area figs 1d f and 3a solutions with larger pasture areas therefore had lower variable costs fig 1a and consequently higher profits increasing land use evenness would require a reduction in pasture area and an increase in pollinasa imports leading to higher variable costs and lower feed self supply fig 1b c the original situation for pesticides appeared in the optimized frontier fig 1g j positively driven by maize areas increasing pesticides pressure and negatively by forest areas synergetic improvements relative to the original situation that reduced variable costs and increased land use evenness protein self supply and forests areas were found with intermediate pasture areas 15 ha and low pollinasa use fig 1 solutions between black lines in la victoria farm lv there was a trade off between economic profits and forest areas too fig 2k increasing palm oil areas determined higher economic profits but with higher variable costs associated to higher pesticide use figs 2a 2g and 3b on the other hand higher land use evenness forest areas and protein self supply could be reached by decreasing palm oil and increasing pastures areas figs 2b f k and 3b in quiringuicharo farm qu economic profits positively correlated with greater maize and beans areas but negatively with forest pastures and land use evenness in this farm no pesticides were used and all protein in animal feeds were produced on farm therefore pesticides use was equal to zero and protein self supply was fully covered fig 3c simulation solutions compared to the original farm configuration showed a great potential for maximizing economic profits and increasing forest areas for conservation presumably due to its large total extension figs 3c and s2 for reforma agraria ra farm economic profits correlated positively with greater beans areas and land use evenness and negatively with forest areas figs 3d and s3 higher variable costs correlated with higher pesticides use in the maize crops and negatively with increasing pastures figs 3d and s3 though the protein self supply was satisfied 100 in this farm by increasing maize silage areas it would be possible to decrease variable costs increasing economic profits fig s3d and s3k this farm showed a great potential to increase forest areas by decreasing beans and increasing maize silage areas fig s3k in zamora pico de oro farm zpo the trade off between pastures and pollinasa figs s4a f drove variable costs land use evenness and protein self supply increasing pastures areas increased the protein self supply increasing the pollinasa feed increased land use evenness but also variable costs palm oil and maize areas were positively correlated with pesticides figs s4g j and 3e finally there was a trade off between forest areas and economic profits profits were positively correlated with increasing mahogany and palm oil areas and higher pesticides use figs s4k g and 3e 3 2 analyzing the initial situations and those optimized in the conservation production trade off frontier tfs differed from each other when considering the pathways from their initial farm situations to those states that simultaneously improve forest conservation and profitability both low and high income tfs showed low and high potential to increase conservation areas and or increase economic profits see the distances between black triangles with red diamonds in figs 1k 2k s3k s4k s5k and table 2 for tfs with low potential improving the conservation production antagonism meant a penalization in sustainable intensification objectives such as decreasing protein self supply 19 and 51 5 for sj and lv and increasing variable costs 15 for both table 2 it is necessary to highlight that in sj a low income farm the total volume of pesticides used is only 10 of the application in lv due to the smaller land size 24 0 vs 61 5 ha moreover sj is characterized by the livestock traditional maize system unlike lv that mainly produces livestock palm oil with high input rates tfs with high potential for conservation and production i e qu ra similar to qu and therefore not included in table 2 and zpo showed that increasing conservation areas and increasing economic profits simultaneously could be achieved through maintaining or improving the sustainable intensification objectives for qu low income increasing maize for grains maize for silage 2 4 to 13 ha table 2 and beans areas could increase crop diversity land use evenness and economic profits from 113 to 281 us yr 1 159 while pastures areas could be released for conservation 53 to 2 ha table 2 a larger amount of maize silage for feed could compensate the reduction in pasture area resulting in maintaining protein self supply table 2 in high income tfs of zpo decreasing the palm oil area 11 to 1 5 ha 86 and increasing the mahogany area 4 times a high value afforestation may enable an increase of 56 in conservation areas from 14 5 to 22 6 ha and economic profits from 3083 to 5226 us yr 1 70 moreover reducing palm oil production would decrease pesticide use and variable costs table 2 4 discussion 4 1 strategies associated to relieve the trade off between conservation and agricultural production we explored potential alternative farm configurations and management strategies in tfs that could contribute to maximize conservation areas and sustainable intensification production the trade offs between obtaining higher profits versus conserving forest were clear across all tfs figs 1k 2k s 6 however farm modeling using pareto based multi objective optimization yielded alternative solutions that could overcome this trend increasing conservation areas and incomes decreasing the local pressure of agricultural expansion on the remaining tropical rainforest patches regarding objectives and decision variables for all farms the objective of increasing forest areas was not mainly determined by some land use area or management except for lv where forest areas correlated with beans and lemon crop areas fig 3b on the other hand increasing economic profits was associated with particular crops managements depending on each tfs configuration fig 3 hence conservation and production objectives seem to be reachable through different strategies that increase the unit of agricultural product per area i e intensifying the production areas in that regard initial farm configurations determined particular pathways for intensifying through increasing external inputs e g in sj or through sustainable practices e g in qu 4 2 multi objective optimization for conservation production issues for natural resource management and production groot et al 2010 2007 applied the landscape images model to spatial planning to reconcile crop yields nutrient losses and natural hedgerows structure one highlight was that to improve hedgerow cohesion it would be necessary to replace longitudinal to transversal hedgerow positions incurring new costs of implementation in our case for those farms which had more potential to increase forest areas qu ra and zpo fragments could be established strategically in the systems to for example reduce erosion in plots with high slopes or leave streams covered to prevent them from drying out grimaldi et al 2014 strategic allocation of forest regeneration patches does not require financial investment and could increase long term returns by taking advantage of the regulation in ecosystem services that natural fragments could provide decocq et al 2016 todman et al 2019 evaluated agricultural landscapes with different crop managements and their potential negative impacts on the environment greenhouse gas emissions with a multi objective optimization algorithm they found that in the best soils expected to produce high yields management strategies still have a great potential to improve environmental and economical outcomes although these results were counterintuitive and good for discussion amongst stakeholders similarly we found alternative configurations to maintain forest patches despite the strong trade off between forest areas and economic profits also multi objective simulation highlighted different land use practices for each farm that could increase economic profits per hectare releasing areas for forest 4 3 contributions to the land sharing vs land sparing debate various studies have provided theoretical and practical support to the idea that increasing yields per hectare is an effective tool to release land for conservation land sparing approach folberth et al 2020 phalan et al 2016 on the other hand there are studies that show that simplified high yield crop systems are the main causes of tropical deforestation byerlee et al 2014 meyfroidt et al 2014 richards et al 2012 for a land sparing strategy to be successful in our case tfs with higher input production and economic benefit should allow a larger proportion of forest areas however in contrast tfs with the highest income and pesticides use table s4 lv and zpo showed low percentage of forest cover the lowest for the case of zpo compared to those tfs with the smallest areas sj and ra with 24 and 43 5 ha respectively and intermediate economic profits per ha table s4 these relatively small tfs with low pesticides use showed the largest proportions of forest areas hence land sparing in human modified tropical landscapes with high yielding activities using high external inputs may produce high economic incomes but may not guarantee the forest conservation moreover these activities lead to dominance of monocultures and increased pesticides use and associated negative externalities for the environment 4 4 multi objective optimizations in mexican farming systems few studies in mexico have been performed with multi objective models to evaluate alternative solutions in farming systems flores sánchez et al 2015 evaluated alternative solutions with farmdesign in smaller farms 1 to 4 ha in the state of guerrero unlike our study the authors simulated new alternatives fertilization and soil endowments and animal husbandry to evaluate ex ante improvements in farms economy soil conditions and labor cortez arriola et al 2016 using farmdesign applied comparable principles of sustainable intensification to dairy farms they found synergies between increasing economic incomes and decreasing feed costs similarly lv and zpo farms showed negative correlations between external feeds maize or pollinasa and economic profits fig 3 in the former studies of flores sanchez et al 2015 and cortez arriola et al 2016 an important additional objective was to improve organic matter balance which we did not consider although it could have improved the insights on long term sustainability of alternative managements 4 5 practical implications and recommendations producing food in areas of great importance for biodiversity conservation is an issue that has recently gained much attention from world society however many inhabitants of these places face economic pressures and lack of support to be able to produce without falling into simplified extensive crops meyfroidt et al 2014 as our study shows there are no general land use configurations nor managements to be implemented in all tfs since each farm characteristics determine the multi objective optimization and outcomes our results support the ideas proposed by cunningham et al 2013 in their position paper that highlights that intensification and conservation of systems is possible as long as site specific conditions are considered therefore the analysis of particular cases at least at ejido level as done in this study is necessary to improve the agricultural production and forest conservation through sustainable practices it is worth noticing that due to the way farmdesign is structured forests and agricultural activities were only considered as independent areas without considering the ecological processes which could be interacting with each other nutrients and water cycling soil degradation conservation and the dynamics of flora and fauna population these interactions could modify the expected estimated modeling results alamgir et al 2016 duflot et al 2022 the multi objective optimization model proved to be a great tool to better represent the local land use and management complexities in tfs we demonstrate that there is potential in tfs to conserve the forest and increase agricultural production simultaneously through sustainable intensification practices for some of the farms depending on their initial configurations since there were no general alternative solutions for all farms the analysis of individual farms or at least typical farms from typological groups emerges as a fundamental aspect in a context where public policies tend to be general and with top down applications our results provide evidence that highlights the importance of considering farm singularities

april less than 60 mm month 1 and with an average monthly temperature of 22 c martínez ramos et al 2009 before 1970 mdc was completely covered by old growth forest later mdc was part of the mexican federal government s land distribution program tarrío garcía and concheiro bórquez 2006 the region experienced immigration from different states of mexico many groups of peasants and indigenous people from different states and also from guatemala de vos and marion 2015 arrived to start or continue their farming activities they were grouped into ejidos communities with a relative degree of institutional organization alcorn and toledo 1995 federal incentives during the 1970s 80 s promoted cattle pastures and staple crops and more recently palm oil production carabias et al 2015 currently 70 of the region is covered livestock pastures crop fields such as maize bean chili palm oil plantations and patches of secondary and old growth forest zermeño hernández et al 2016 however given that the ejidos are mostly constituted by people with the same place of origin and are therefore rather homogeneous the differences between ejidos are large and are reflected in the different agricultural production characteristics associated with the customs of the inhabitants berget et al 2021 lohbeck et al 2022 wies et al 2022 2 2 interviews and farming systems characterization sixty two interviews were conducted in the mdc in five ejidos with different origin groups at least eleven interviews were conducted in each ejido representing more than 9 of the total number of farmers in the sample and 9 5 of the total area of the ejidos to characterize the tfs we designed a semi structured interview aiming to describe the whole farm land uses and the main drivers and farm functioning incurred the most frequent land uses on the farms were maize cropping cattle ranching and remaining forest areas followed by bean palm oil and maize cropping for silage fig s1 and table s1 for each crop we asked about the main drivers behind inputs and outputs when we visited the farmers and carried out interviews we toured the countryside together with the farmer while asking the questions this tour served us to visually check the information they provided and to georeference the vertices of the farm to check the extents they indicated 2 2 1 model based farm construction for each community we modelled a typical farm first we counted current activities in farms grouped into ejido we considered activities practiced by five or more farmers supplementary material fig s1 land uses for each typical farm are shown in table s1 inputs outputs and management decisions for land uses are detailed in figure s2 for cattle production we collected data pertaining to herd structure meat production body weight dry matter intake dmi labor input and sanitary and reproductive management for the cropping activity we collected inputs seeds fertilizers herbicides and insecticides and outputs grain or fruit yields and estimated manure also we registered forage species and utilization to estimate grass productivity and labor costs subsidies and allocation for cattle production parameters to estimate dmi capacity metabolizable energy me and crude protein cp requirements per animal type in the herd were obtained from nrc standards nrc 2001 nutrient requirements for maintenance growth and meat production were obtained from nrc 2001 as well 2 3 data analysis 2 3 1 description of the model we used the farmdesign model to explore trade offs or synergies between optimization objectives as influenced by management choices about areas of agricultural land uses and conservation areas and amounts of inputs like agrochemicals and external feed for livestock farmdesign algorithm uses a pareto based version of the evolutionary algorithm of differential evolution de storn and price 1997 the de algorithm generates two populations of solutions which represent the decision variables that indicate the management choices the opportunity space created by these populations is diverse the variety in the decision variables genotypes creates diversity in landscape performance that is measured by the indicators phenotypes the first population of parents serves as the result set that is iteratively improved while the second population consists of competitors that are generated by uniform cross over of three selected parent solutions in each iteration the parameters of the de algorithm are the probability of cross over cr 0 85 and the amplitude of mutation f 0 15 each population consisted of 1000 solutions the solutions in both populations are ranked using the principle of pareto optimality groot et al 2012 and the euclidean distance between the solutions in the opportunity space is calculated from the normalized indicator values which serves to quantify a crowding metric the pareto principle allows to evaluate all objectives simultaneously without weighing groot and rossing 2011 after the ranking the selection process is conducted by pairwise comparison solutions in the result set population are replaced by individuals from the competitor population if the latter has a better pareto rank or is positioned in a less crowded part of the opportunity space the rank based selection results in movement of the parent population in the direction of the trade off frontier or surface while the crowd based selection ensures spread along the frontier or surface this process was conducted for 1000 iterations the model requires information to describe the biophysical environment socioeconomics production costs of activities and labor type and crop products agronomic inputs and outputs herd composition and products production costs and outputs manure types and degradation rates external sources of mineral nutrients through animal food or fertilizers and physical assets a static farm balance model calculates a large range of indicators pertaining to nutrient and organic matter flows and balances herd feed consumption and energy and protein balance manure balance labor balance and economic results the model can be downloaded freely from https fse models gitlab io compass farmdesign we considered the amount of inputs and the agricultural and conservation areas as decision variables for exploration decision variables must be set within coherent ranges also land use area constraints must be set for farm functioning i e land use areas cannot exceed the farm size model outcomes can serve as objectives that can be either minimized or maximized 2 3 2 decision variables we considered decision variables for crops including pastures for cattle and forest areas and agrochemicals amounts fertilizers and pesticides moreover we added decision variables to modify the destination of products such as maize grain from crop to animal feed or self consumption table 1 2 3 3 constraints and objectives adjustments in decision variables lead to changes in model outcomes outcomes can be selected as constraints that should be within a given range or as objectives that can be minimized or maximized important constraints relate to the feed balance the deviation between demand and supply of energy and protein should be within narrow ranges to allow the production levels to be defined by animal numbers and corresponding productivity moreover the dry matter dm supply to the animals cannot exceed the intake capacity another important constraint was the maximum conservation area which could not exceed the total farming area minimum area for maize and beans required for self consumption was also specified an overview of selected constraints and their allowed ranges for the farm in la victoria is presented in table 1 see variables and constraints information of completing farms in table s3 finally we selected six common objectives for the five farms following the research question of the study the main objectives were to maximize economic profits considered as an integrator of total agricultural production and conservation forest areas then agricultural production had to include sustainable intensification practices as alternative managements that would allow for an easier transition to improved smallholders farming systems the common objectives for all tfs were maximizing economic profits maximizing forest conservation areas maximizing feed protein self supply maximizing land use evenness minimizing agrochemical use herbicides insecticides minimizing variable costs for analyzing the initial farm situations and those optimized in the conservation production trade off frontier we categorized farms according to their potential to improve their initial situations in the solutions plot of the maximization of forest areas and economic profits figs 1k 2k s3k s4k s5k we considered the visual euclidean distance between the coordinates position of the initial status black triangle and one situation which improved both conservation and production chosen from the improved solution frontier red diamond we tagged farms with low potential to those with short distances sj and lv and farms with high potential to those with large distance qu zpo and ra 2 4 statistical analyses and software we used r software http www r project org and rstudio http www rstudio com interface for data analysis in particular we performed principal component analysis with factominer package lê et al 2008 to identify associations between optimization objectives and decision variables then we plotted correlation graphs with ggplot2 package wickham et al 2019 3 results 3 1 trade offs and synergies objectives exploration and farm configuration associated drivers figs 1 and 2 show the relations between the six objectives for the san jose sj low income and la victoria lv high income farms the principal component analyses fig 3 indicate the relations between decision variables and objectives in sj solutions yielded a trade off between forest conservation and economic profits figs 1k and 3a the latter was driven by larger maize areas associated to higher pesticides use figs 1g and 3a moreover there was a synergetic relation between minimizing variable costs driven by the pollinasa external feed figs 1a and 3a and maximizing protein self supply which was associated to an increase in pasture area figs 1d f and 3a solutions with larger pasture areas therefore had lower variable costs fig 1a and consequently higher profits increasing land use evenness would require a reduction in pasture area and an increase in pollinasa imports leading to higher variable costs and lower feed self supply fig 1b c the original situation for pesticides appeared in the optimized frontier fig 1g j positively driven by maize areas increasing pesticides pressure and negatively by forest areas synergetic improvements relative to the original situation that reduced variable costs and increased land use evenness protein self supply and forests areas were found with intermediate pasture areas 15 ha and low pollinasa use fig 1 solutions between black lines in la victoria farm lv there was a trade off between economic profits and forest areas too fig 2k increasing palm oil areas determined higher economic profits but with higher variable costs associated to higher pesticide use figs 2a 2g and 3b on the other hand higher land use evenness forest areas and protein self supply could be reached by decreasing palm oil and increasing pastures areas figs 2b f k and 3b in quiringuicharo farm qu economic profits positively correlated with greater maize and beans areas but negatively with forest pastures and land use evenness in this farm no pesticides were used and all protein in animal feeds were produced on farm therefore pesticides use was equal to zero and protein self supply was fully covered fig 3c simulation solutions compared to the original farm configuration showed a great potential for maximizing economic profits and increasing forest areas for conservation presumably due to its large total extension figs 3c and s2 for reforma agraria ra farm economic profits correlated positively with greater beans areas and land use evenness and negatively with forest areas figs 3d and s3 higher variable costs correlated with higher pesticides use in the maize crops and negatively with increasing pastures figs 3d and s3 though the protein self supply was satisfied 100 in this farm by increasing maize silage areas it would be possible to decrease variable costs increasing economic profits fig s3d and s3k this farm showed a great potential to increase forest areas by decreasing beans and increasing maize silage areas fig s3k in zamora pico de oro farm zpo the trade off between pastures and pollinasa figs s4a f drove variable costs land use evenness and protein self supply increasing pastures areas increased the protein self supply increasing the pollinasa feed increased land use evenness but also variable costs palm oil and maize areas were positively correlated with pesticides figs s4g j and 3e finally there was a trade off between forest areas and economic profits profits were positively correlated with increasing mahogany and palm oil areas and higher pesticides use figs s4k g and 3e 3 2 analyzing the initial situations and those optimized in the conservation production trade off frontier tfs differed from each other when considering the pathways from their initial farm situations to those states that simultaneously improve forest conservation and profitability both low and high income tfs showed low and high potential to increase conservation areas and or increase economic profits see the distances between black triangles with red diamonds in figs 1k 2k s3k s4k s5k and table 2 for tfs with low potential improving the conservation production antagonism meant a penalization in sustainable intensification objectives such as decreasing protein self supply 19 and 51 5 for sj and lv and increasing variable costs 15 for both table 2 it is necessary to highlight that in sj a low income farm the total volume of pesticides used is only 10 of the application in lv due to the smaller land size 24 0 vs 61 5 ha moreover sj is characterized by the livestock traditional maize system unlike lv that mainly produces livestock palm oil with high input rates tfs with high potential for conservation and production i e qu ra similar to qu and therefore not included in table 2 and zpo showed that increasing conservation areas and increasing economic profits simultaneously could be achieved through maintaining or improving the sustainable intensification objectives for qu low income increasing maize for grains maize for silage 2 4 to 13 ha table 2 and beans areas could increase crop diversity land use evenness and economic profits from 113 to 281 us yr 1 159 while pastures areas could be released for conservation 53 to 2 ha table 2 a larger amount of maize silage for feed could compensate the reduction in pasture area resulting in maintaining protein self supply table 2 in high income tfs of zpo decreasing the palm oil area 11 to 1 5 ha 86 and increasing the mahogany area 4 times a high value afforestation may enable an increase of 56 in conservation areas from 14 5 to 22 6 ha and economic profits from 3083 to 5226 us yr 1 70 moreover reducing palm oil production would decrease pesticide use and variable costs table 2 4 discussion 4 1 strategies associated to relieve the trade off between conservation and agricultural production we explored potential alternative farm configurations and management strategies in tfs that could contribute to maximize conservation areas and sustainable intensification production the trade offs between obtaining higher profits versus conserving forest were clear across all tfs figs 1k 2k s 6 however farm modeling using pareto based multi objective optimization yielded alternative solutions that could overcome this trend increasing conservation areas and incomes decreasing the local pressure of agricultural expansion on the remaining tropical rainforest patches regarding objectives and decision variables for all farms the objective of increasing forest areas was not mainly determined by some land use area or management except for lv where forest areas correlated with beans and lemon crop areas fig 3b on the other hand increasing economic profits was associated with particular crops managements depending on each tfs configuration fig 3 hence conservation and production objectives seem to be reachable through different strategies that increase the unit of agricultural product per area i e intensifying the production areas in that regard initial farm configurations determined particular pathways for intensifying through increasing external inputs e g in sj or through sustainable practices e g in qu 4 2 multi objective optimization for conservation production issues for natural resource management and production groot et al 2010 2007 applied the landscape images model to spatial planning to reconcile crop yields nutrient losses and natural hedgerows structure one highlight was that to improve hedgerow cohesion it would be necessary to replace longitudinal to transversal hedgerow positions incurring new costs of implementation in our case for those farms which had more potential to increase forest areas qu ra and zpo fragments could be established strategically in the systems to for example reduce erosion in plots with high slopes or leave streams covered to prevent them from drying out grimaldi et al 2014 strategic allocation of forest regeneration patches does not require financial investment and could increase long term returns by taking advantage of the regulation in ecosystem services that natural fragments could provide decocq et al 2016 todman et al 2019 evaluated agricultural landscapes with different crop managements and their potential negative impacts on the environment greenhouse gas emissions with a multi objective optimization algorithm they found that in the best soils expected to produce high yields management strategies still have a great potential to improve environmental and economical outcomes although these results were counterintuitive and good for discussion amongst stakeholders similarly we found alternative configurations to maintain forest patches despite the strong trade off between forest areas and economic profits also multi objective simulation highlighted different land use practices for each farm that could increase economic profits per hectare releasing areas for forest 4 3 contributions to the land sharing vs land sparing debate various studies have provided theoretical and practical support to the idea that increasing yields per hectare is an effective tool to release land for conservation land sparing approach folberth et al 2020 phalan et al 2016 on the other hand there are studies that show that simplified high yield crop systems are the main causes of tropical deforestation byerlee et al 2014 meyfroidt et al 2014 richards et al 2012 for a land sparing strategy to be successful in our case tfs with higher input production and economic benefit should allow a larger proportion of forest areas however in contrast tfs with the highest income and pesticides use table s4 lv and zpo showed low percentage of forest cover the lowest for the case of zpo compared to those tfs with the smallest areas sj and ra with 24 and 43 5 ha respectively and intermediate economic profits per ha table s4 these relatively small tfs with low pesticides use showed the largest proportions of forest areas hence land sparing in human modified tropical landscapes with high yielding activities using high external inputs may produce high economic incomes but may not guarantee the forest conservation moreover these activities lead to dominance of monocultures and increased pesticides use and associated negative externalities for the environment 4 4 multi objective optimizations in mexican farming systems few studies in mexico have been performed with multi objective models to evaluate alternative solutions in farming systems flores sánchez et al 2015 evaluated alternative solutions with farmdesign in smaller farms 1 to 4 ha in the state of guerrero unlike our study the authors simulated new alternatives fertilization and soil endowments and animal husbandry to evaluate ex ante improvements in farms economy soil conditions and labor cortez arriola et al 2016 using farmdesign applied comparable principles of sustainable intensification to dairy farms they found synergies between increasing economic incomes and decreasing feed costs similarly lv and zpo farms showed negative correlations between external feeds maize or pollinasa and economic profits fig 3 in the former studies of flores sanchez et al 2015 and cortez arriola et al 2016 an important additional objective was to improve organic matter balance which we did not consider although it could have improved the insights on long term sustainability of alternative managements 4 5 practical implications and recommendations producing food in areas of great importance for biodiversity conservation is an issue that has recently gained much attention from world society however many inhabitants of these places face economic pressures and lack of support to be able to produce without falling into simplified extensive crops meyfroidt et al 2014 as our study shows there are no general land use configurations nor managements to be implemented in all tfs since each farm characteristics determine the multi objective optimization and outcomes our results support the ideas proposed by cunningham et al 2013 in their position paper that highlights that intensification and conservation of systems is possible as long as site specific conditions are considered therefore the analysis of particular cases at least at ejido level as done in this study is necessary to improve the agricultural production and forest conservation through sustainable practices it is worth noticing that due to the way farmdesign is structured forests and agricultural activities were only considered as independent areas without considering the ecological processes which could be interacting with each other nutrients and water cycling soil degradation conservation and the dynamics of flora and fauna population these interactions could modify the expected estimated modeling results alamgir et al 2016 duflot et al 2022 the multi objective optimization model proved to be a great tool to better represent the local land use and management complexities in tfs we demonstrate that there is potential in tfs to conserve the forest and increase agricultural production simultaneously through sustainable intensification practices for some of the farms depending on their initial configurations since there were no general alternative solutions for all farms the analysis of individual farms or at least typical farms from typological groups emerges as a fundamental aspect in a context where public policies tend to be general and with top down applications our results provide evidence that highlights the importance of considering farm singularities

24151,extensive kiwifruit farming patterns worldwide are generating increasing environmental stress and thus hindering their sustainability comprehensive performance based on resource efficiency and resource structure pollutant emissions impact and carbon emission is still not clear for this planting system therefore this study proposes a comprehensive evaluation of kiwifruit planting systems by combining emergy analysis with carbon emission accounting method the proposed approach not only considers the resource efficiency and resource structure of this planting system as well as its carbon emission intensity but also describe tradeoffs among emergy sustainability pollutant emissions impacts and carbon emission intensity using the proposed index co benefit index cbi finally four kiwifruit planting systems from china kiwifruit planting system in sichuan province scps and kiwifruit planting system in shaanxi sxps italy kiwifruit planting system in italy itps and iran kiwifruit planting system in iran irps as case studies are investigated using the presented approach the study results show that 1 carbon emission intensity co2 eq kg product embodies trends of sxps 0 16 itps 0

resources especially labor and services l s and chemical fertilizers 4 results of co benefit index reflect the trends of irps scps itps sxps accordingly some targeted measures are proposed for scps sxps and itps considering low sustainability level it is urgent for the four kiwifruit planting systems to further improve their utilization rate of chemical fertilizer and resource structure in the future keywords kiwifruit planting emergy analysis indicators pollutant emissions impacts carbon emission co benefit index 1 introduction kiwifruit as one kind of nutrient dense fruit has a reputation for promoting good health due to exceptionally high content of vitamin c and an array of other nutrients dietary fiber potassium vitamin e and folate etc as well as various bioactive components richardson et al 2018 as a primitive antioxidant it can neutralizes free radicals to avoid or reduce cell damages and related illness mostashari rad et al 2021 currently china produces about half of the total kiwifruit output in the world fao the food and agriculture organization 2021 but only 1 of which is exported therein shaanxi and sichuan provinces are the top two production areas in this country shaanxi statistical bureau 2021 china economic information network 2023 other countries with high production capacity of kiwifruit besides china include italy iran etc fao 2021 most of which is destined for export related resources and environmental issues have been more concerned in kiwifruit planting high kiwifruit yields in many countries are mainly sustained by large amounts of agricultural materials such as fertilizers pesticides and fossil resources etc which also aggravates pollutant emissions impacts abdi et al 2012 and global warming due to rising carbon emissions kouchaki penchah et al 2016 kiwi planting could adversely affect local groundwater and air quality lu et al 2016 found that the nitrate n accumulation in the 0 100 cm and 0 200 cm soil layers in kiwi orchards were 466 and 793 kg n ha 1 in the yujiahe catchment of shaanxi china respectively which poses a great risk for nitrate leaching and subsequent groundwater pollution gao et al 2021 revealed that intensive kiwi orchards caused higher n surplus in orchards than croplands 1206 vs 282 kg ha 1 yr 1 and the nitrate concentrations of 97 of groundwater samples exceeded the who standard in the northern slope region of the qinling mountains china nikkhah et al 2016 revealed that the amounts of air pollutant emissions of nh3 nox and so2 reached 2 00 0 30 and 0 15 kg t 1 kiwifruit respectively in guilan province iran based on a life cycle assessment li 2022 found that volatilization amount of 11 57 13 98 kg nh3 hm 2 in kiwi orchards in zhouzhi county s yujia river catchment in the middle of northern slope region of the qinling mountains meanwhile greenhouse effect derived from kiwi planting industry has been concerned some scholars have quantified carbon emissions of kiwi planting systems in some specific regions in several countries using life cycle assessment therein carbon source t co2 eq t 1 kiwifruit related studies include the packaging and transport of kiwifruit in new zealand ranging from 0 33 to 0 67 delivered to a store of japan and germany robertson et al 2014 0 14 0 22 in the bay of plenty new zealand müller et al 2015 0 15 0 32 in guilan province iran nikkhah et al 2016 mostashari rad et al 2020 0 11 0 14 a deliciosa in piedmont in italy baudino et al 2017 0 14 in campania southern italy pergola et al 2022 etc and all these issues will hinder sustainable kiwifruit production in the future browne et al 2011 related methods including life cycle assessment lca energy flow analysis efa and economic analysis eca etc have been adopted for the performance evaluation of cropping systems therein lca focuses on assessing the inputs outputs and potential environmental impacts of a product system over its life cycle for example lca was used for the environmental assessment of peach orchards in italy ingrao et al 2015 it revealed that there are multiple opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions from these orchards bacenetti et al 2016 assessed the environmental performance of organic rice cultivation in the pavia region northern italy using the lca to highlight the main environmental hotspots of organic rice planting in this area fusi et al 2014 applied the lca to assessment of the environmental consequences of rice production in vercelli district piedmont region northern italy to optimize different straw management strategies lca can evaluate the environmental impact of a product during its life cycle from resource and energy consumption and environmental emissions but it ignores the environmental contribution to social economy and it cannot evaluate the contribution of human labor to the crop production efa can describe the energy efficiency of a system during the course of energy conversion yuan and peng 2017 examined the trends of energy inputs and outputs in crop production in china from 1991 to 2012 using efa the study showed that china s government should increase investment in technology development and technological innovation adopt new policies to optimize the structure of crop production so as to promote the sustainable cropping system in the country montemurro et al 2020 compared different management strategies in a four year organic cropping system by efa two different living mulches with no till and green manure were compared with a cropping system without cover crop their results indicated that the introduction of the cover crop as living mulch combined with no till could be a powerful tool to enhance the sustainability without compromising the crop yields however efa only considers the flow and transformation of energy but ignore the contribution of natural inputs and the quality differences of different resources and energy sources which could reduce completeness of the analysis results eca measures the economic value of goods labor and services in the social economy in terms of their monetary value which mainly focuses on human contributions this method is often combined with lca to evaluate performance of systems for example chen et al 2021 used lca and eca to estimate the environmental impacts and economic benefit of three typical rice field rotation systems it was found that fertilizer diesel water electricity and fodder should be emphasized and related measures should be taken to improve resource use efficiency and reduce environmental emissions however eca could not provide complete policy making information due to ignorance of the environmental contribution to social economy compared with the abovementioned methods advantages of emergy analysis ema lies in 1 adopting a unified unit of measurement solar energy joules sej 2 considering the environmental contribution to social economy and 3 distinguishing quality differences of diverse resources and energy sources as well as labor and service odum 1988 therefore it can provide more complete information for decision making so far ema has been widely applied to evaluation of environmental sustainability of agricultural farming systems for example zhuang et al 2022 used ema to evaluate china s staple crop production systems wheat maize and rice and concluded that china has great potential to improve the sustainability of its staple crops production based on provincial data in china in 2016 zhao et al 2019 used this approach to analyze the environmental performance of the cucumber production system it was found that improving resource use efficiency using more clean energy sources and increasing mechanization would promote sustainable development of this cropping system xu et al 2021 used lca and ema to evaluate the tea production system in china and found that this system is a highly polluting industry its environmental impact can be greatly reduced by improving fertilizer use efficiency adopting new varieties and using renewable energy sources houshyar et al 2018 explored the environmental impacts of wheat and maize cropping systems through ema they found that the environmental loading rate of the maize production is much higher than that of wheat production zhang et al 2016 used ema to explore the integrated performance of crop systems in china it was found that from 2000 to 2010 crop production efficiency of china was improved slightly but its environmental load increased significantly to compare the sustainability levels of different agricultural practices from ecological and economic perspectives liu et al 2019a used ema to conduct a comprehensive assessment of straw repatriation and straw free maize soybean rotation systems in the central loess plateau region and they found that labor and renewable resource inputs have the main effects on the sustainability of crop production in china emergy accounting is also commonly used for comparisons of environmental performance among cropping systems of different countries for example ali et al 2019 compared the environmental stresses of crop production in pakistan and india using ema the main findings indicate that purchased renewable inputs e g irrigation water and purchased non renewable inputs e g agricultural labor are the largest contributors to total inputs in both countries and that india is more productive than pakistan although ema has been widely used to assess the sustainability of various crop production systems no studies have been found to assess the sustainability of kiwifruit farming systems using this approach which is not beneficial for this farming system to improve its comprehensive performance due to lacking full decision making information furthermore classic ema mainly concentrates on resource structure and resource efficiency of the system in study however it cannot provide pollutants impacts on human and the environment as well as carbon footprint related information which have been paid more attention to in the background of increasingly strict environmental supervision and carbon neutrality requirements therefore ema needs to be improved to integrate pollutant emissions impacts in its accounting framework zhang et al 2009 2018 meanwhile this method should be supplemented using carbon emission amounting method to provide carbon footprint related information pan et al 2022 in recent years due to the increase in kiwifruit output related resources and environmental issues have attracted the attention of several scholars around the world for example nikkhah et al 2016 applied lca and cobb douglas to investigate the environmental impacts of kiwifruit production in guilan province iran the results showed that the greatest environmental impact of this fruit production was eutrophication and that urea fertilization had a statistically significantly negative impact on kiwifruit yield nabavi pelesaraei et al 2016 used an artificial neural network approach to predict and conduct a sensitivity analysis of energy inputs and greenhouse gas emissions in three groups of kiwifruit orchards with different sizes in guilan province iran the results showed that diesel and nitrogen fertilizer were the most sensitive inputs for kiwifruit production and ghg emissions mohammadi et al 2010 used efa to examine the energy flows of inputs and outputs used in kiwifruit production it was found that energy inputs of human labor irrigation water total fertilizer and machinery contributed significantly to yield therein human labor energy had the highest impact on kiwifruit production however the abovementioned studies only focus on one single aspect e g energy inputs environmental impacts or greenhouse gas emissions which can lead to an incomplete information for policy making in addition to this existing studies have mainly focused on the environmental impact of kiwifruit cultivation however few studies have considered the environmental contribution to this cropping system and also not carried out comparison of comprehensive performance of different kiwifruit cropping systems based on their resource efficiency and resource structure pollutant emissions impacts and carbon emissions and all these should be fully investigated so as to provide more complete information for decision making for sustainable kiwifruit planting in the future for meeting increasingly strict environmental supervision and carbon emission regulation to attain full decision making information it is necessary to consider resource efficiency pollutant emissions impacts and ghg emissions simultaneously when comparing the comprehensive performance of different kiwifruit cropping systems to this end this study proposed a performance evaluation approach to compare the resource efficiency and resource structure pollution emissions impacts and ghg emission intensity as well as comprehensive performance using ema and greenhouse gas emission accounting methods as well as one compound index co benefit index cbi four kiwifruit planting systems from china iran and italy as study cases were evaluated using the presented approach the novelty of this study lies in 1 constructing one comprehensive performance evaluation approach for planting systems based on resources utilization and environmental emissions impacts as well as their relationship which can not only provide single information on resource structure and resource efficiency pollutant emissions impacts and carbon footprint but also give an overall conclusion for final decision making through integrating those single information and 2 providing beneficial suggestions for improving resource and environmental performance of kiwifruit farming as well as overall conclusions for final decision making the paper is structured as follows following section 1 section 2 describes the four study cases section 3 introduces the research approach and data sources section 4 presents the main results and carries out related discussions and section 5 makes policy recommendations finally the main conclusions are summarized in section 6 2 introduction of the study cases china has produced about 50 of the total kiwifruit output in the world during 2010 2020 fig 1 therein shaanxi and sichuan provinces contributes 51 39 and 17 70 to the output of this country shaanxi statistical bureau 2021 china economic information network 2023 besides china italy and iran are also two of countries with high production capacity of kiwifruit and they contribute 11 77 and 6 69 to total output in the world in the year 2020 respectively fig 1 therein the two districts considered in the two countries are the main kiwi planting areas so the four kiwi planting systems in the three countries have good representativeness and their locations are shown in fig 2 moreover detailed information on the four cases is introduced as follows 2 1 kiwi planting system in sichuan province scps scps is located in pujiang county between 103 19 103 41 e and 30 05 30 20 n sichuan province china this county belongs to the sichuan basin central subtropical monsoon humid climate zone wang et al 2020 the annual average temperature was 17 2 the annual average radiation is 86 02 kcal cm2 and the annual average rainfall was 1181 4 mm he 2019 these climate conditions are conducive for kiwifruit planting pujiang kiwifruit is a specialty of pujiang county sichuan province and it is also a national geographical indication product in china on december 23 2019 pujiang kiwifruit was selected as one of the top 100 iconic brands of china s agricultural products in 2016 planting area of kiwifruit in this county was 5 0 103 hectares its total output reached 5 7 104 tons and realized economic output of about 6 0 108 yuan wang and jiang 2017 generally pujiang kiwifruit planting system is representative in the world according to its output 2 2 kiwi planting system in shaanxi sxps sxps is located in zhouzhi county between the 107 39 108 37 e and 33 42 34 14 n shaanxi province china this county belongs to temperate sub humid continental monsoon climate with annual radiation of 109 68 kcal cm2 annual sunshine time of 1993 7 h and annual sunshine percentage of 41 the annual average temperature is 13 2 the annual average precipitation is 674 3 mm and the annual average wind speed is 1 3 m s this county was regarded as the kiwifruit hometown in china and certified as green food by the china green food development center according to local statistical data about 60 percent of fresh kiwifruit and 80 percent of dry kiwifruit comes from this county respectively in china therefore sxps still has very good representativeness in the world 2 3 kiwi planting system in iran irps iran ranks the seventh in the world according to its kiwifruit output guilan province is the second largest producer of kiwifruit in iran nabavi pelesaraei et al 2016 here irps is located in talesh city 37 33 38 16 n and 48 32 49 03 e guilan province iran the guilan province is located in the northern region of iran south of the caspian sea and it is one of the most important agricultural provinces in iran zareiforoush et al 2010 the annual average temperature and rainfall in talesh city is 19 c and 1585 mm respectively the annual average radiation is 752 71 kcal cm2 and the annual average wind speed is 2 64 m s the agricultural sector provides approximately 48 percent of direct employment in this city ministry of jihad e agriculture of iran 2014 2 4 kiwi planting system in italy itps italy is one of the main kiwifruit producers in the world testolin and ferguson 2009 itps is located in the piedmont region of northwest italy 44 40 n and 07 59 e with the annual average precipitation of 950 mm the annual average temperature of 11 9 c the annual average radiation of 121 63 kcal cm2 and the annual average wind speed of 1 3 m s to ease comparisons here one hectare of kiwifruit cultivation area is chosen the study did not make differences among diverse kiwifruit varieties because individual orchards tend to grow several kiwifruit varieties e g red heart yellow heart simultaneously and cannot attain related accurate data 3 methods 3 1 ema emergy theory was founded by odum in the 1980s odum 1988 liu et al 2019b and ema is an effective method to evaluate the resource efficiency and resource structure of a system through its extended analysis boundary from the environmental system to social economic system and thus it establishes a link between the human social system and the environment fang et al 2017 since any energy source on earth is derived from solar energy the solar energy joule is regarded as a metric to calculate the amount of solar energy contained in the energy flowing or stored by matter zhang et al 2016 the true value and contribution of different types and hierarchical levels of energy sources in the eco economic system can be measured and compared based on emergy as a result ema provides uniform metric for describing the flow of energy matter and currency in the system for objective evaluation of its environmental performance the emergy value of one resource or energy source is calculated by multiplying its quantity by the corresponding unit emergy value uev uev expressing solar emergy needed to provide 1 g j or of a product or service is a key parameter of the approach the emergy baseline as the basis for all emergy accounting is a reference in the process of emergy evaluation and it is the sum of the annual energy inputs of solar radiation energy tidal energy and geothermal energy on the earth brown and ulgiati 2016 at present five emergy baselines have emerged in emergy related research brown et al 2016 to keep consistence of results in a study this paper adopts the latest emergy baseline i e 12 0e 24 sej yr 1 brown et al 2016 here the emergy evaluation starts from agricultural materials and labor entering into the kiwifruit planting systems and ends with the products leaving the systems 3 1 1 system description of one kiwifruit planting system and its emergy flows fig 3 shows the emergy flow of one kiwifruit planting system its total emergy input comes from local renewable resources r1 such as sunlight wind and rain local non renewable resources n imported renewable resources f1r such as renewable part of investment and operating cost irc for l s and imported non renewable resources f1n such as electricity gasoline diesel nitrogen fertilizer phosphate fertilizer potash fertilizer compound fertilizer organic fertilizer insecticide fungicide plastic bagging mechanical equipment non renewable part of irc the proportion of renewable and nonrenewable parts of irc is approximately 0 02 and 0 98 respectively the national environmental accounting database https www emergy nead com home outputs include products y kiwifruit and pollutant emissions w such as so2 nox and nh3 and ghg emissions pollutant emissions could require ecological services r2 to dilute them to acceptable levels when they exceed local environmental capacity meanwhile they may also cause economic losses f2 before reaching their acceptable levels due to harming human health land occupation adversely affecting biodiversity 3 1 2 calculating pollutant emissions impacts to calculate pollutant emissions impacts amount of pollutant emissions should be firstly quantified and it can be calculated using eq 1 1 w i i 1 n a l i e f i where wi is the amount of the i th pollutant emission kg ali is amount of i th agricultural material efi is the emission factor of i th agricultural material as shown in table 1 in this study we used the method proposed by zhang et al 2009 to assess the impact of pollutant emissions 1 quantifying extra ecological services for diluting pollutant emissions ecological services are environmental self purification involving a series of physical chemical and biological processes zhang et al 2009 here due to the lack of other basic data only the dilution function provided by the atmospheric environment and the water bodies are considered in the process of crop planting some pollutants derived from use of a large number of chemical fertilizers pesticides etc will be discharged into the environment to make those emitted pollutants meet the relevant environmental quality standards the extra ecological service will be needed to dilute them the ecological services of diluting air and water pollutants are calculated using eq 2 2 m i d w i c i where mi refers to the amount of air or water needed for diluting pollutants kg d represents the density of air or water 1 23 kg m3 for air and 1 00e 03 kg m3 for water wi stands for the annual emission amount of the i th pollutant kg ci is the environmentally acceptable concentration of the i th pollutant next the emergy of the ecological service can be calculated using eqs 3 and 4 for diluting air pollutants and water pollutants respectively 3 r w air 1 2 m air v 2 t r air 4 r w water m water t r water where rw air rw water is the emergy of the ecological service used to dilute an air pollutant and one water pollutant sej yr respectively v stands for the annual mean wind speed m s from local meteorological statistic data trair denotes the uev of wind energy which equals to 1 91e 03 sej j ulgiati and brown 2002 based on the baseline 12 0e 24 sej yr trwater denotes the uev of surface runoff in china which equals to 2 85e 07 sej kg corrected to the baseline 12 0e 24 sej yr considering that one ecological service can dilute different types of pollutants in a given medium at the same time the sum of the maximum values of the two ecological services is taken as the emergy value of the final ecological service required as shown in eq 5 5 r 2 m a x r w a i r m a x r w w a t e r 2 quantifying emergy loss resulting from pollutant emissions pollutant emissions could harm the ecosystem and human health before they attain related environmental quality standards these potential losses mainly derive from the loss of natural capital by damaging biodiversity and economic losses by affecting human health f2 and land occupation zhang et al 2009 due to the lack of specific ecological parameters this study does not consider the damage caused by pollutants to the ecosystem and land occupation but only quantifies the impact of air pollutants on human health the disability adjusted life year daly can be used to measure the damage of pollutants to human health and it is a widely used method to evaluate human health risks and the quantification method is shown in eq 6 according to ref zhang et al 2018 6 f 2 i 1 n m i d a l y i τ h where f2 refers to the emergy loss in support of the affected human health sej yr i denotes the i th pollutant in the study mi refers to the mass of the i th pollutant kg yr daly stands for the eco indicator 99 impact factor yr kg of emissions and τh represents the annual emergy use per capita in a country or region and it can be quantified using eq 7 and related parameters can be calculated using eqs 8 and 9 7 τ h r e m 2020 g d p 2020 p o p 2020 8 r e m 2020 r e m 2015 i g d p 2020 i g d p 2015 g d p 2020 g d p 2015 9 r e m 2015 t e u 2015 g d p 2015 where rem2020 and rem2015 stands for

79e 11 sej cny τh 2 00e 16 sej person yr finally the total pollutant emissions impact tei can be summarized as sum of r2 and f2 3 1 3 the corresponding emergy based indicators the emergy based indicators reflect the resource structure and resource efficiency and can be used to compare the performance of systems from different perspectives according to the characteristics of the research systems the adopted indicators are depicted as follows 1 uev the indicator is equal to the total emergy input divided by the output of the product and it reflects the resource efficiency of the production system for different processes with the same similar products or services the lower the uev value the higher the resource efficiency pulselli et al 2011 and this indicator can be calculated using eq 10 10 uev n r 1 f 1 r f 1 n y where uev is the unit emergy value of the product service sej kg n is the emergy of local nonrenewable inputs sej yr r1 is the emergy of local renewable inputs sej yr f1r is the emergy of purchased renewable inputs sej yr f1n is the emergy of purchased nonrenewable inputs sej yr y is annual product yield kg 2 renewability percent r this indicator equals to the ratio of renewable input to total emergy input the larger indicator value means the more reasonable resource structure and thus can reduce the environmental load of the system and it can be calculated using eq 11 11 r r 1 f 1 r n r 1 f 1 r f 1 n 100 3 emergy yield ratio eyr eyr is defined as the ratio of total emergy input to imported emergy the larger indicator value reflects the stronger competitiveness ability or better economic benefit of the system and it can be calculated using eq 12 12 eyr n r 1 f 1 r f 1 n f 1 r f 1 n 4 environmental loading ratio elr elr is the ratio of the total emergy of non renewable inputs to the total emergy of renewable inputs and it indicates the potential pressure on the environment a bigger indicator value indicates a larger pressure on the environment and it can be quantified by using the eq 13 13 elr n f 1 n r 1 f 1 r 5 emergy sustainable index esi the esi is defined as the ratio of the eyr to the elr which reflects the output per unit of environmental load when esi 1 the system is unsustainable in the long run when 1 esi 5 the system is sustainable in the medium term when 5 esi 10 the system is sustainable in the long run when esi 10 the system is underdeveloped it can be quantified using eq 14 14 esi eyr rlr 6 pollution emissions impact intensity pei sej t product extra ecological services and adverse emissions impacts on human and the environment will potentially influence the comprehensive performance of one system here the indicator pei was proposed to describe the environmental impact of the kiwifruit planting systems this indicator is defined as the total pollutant emissions impact tei sej yr shown in eq 15 divided by the annual product output y t product yr as shown in eq 16 the larger indicator value means the stronger pollutants impact intensity 15 t e i r 2 f 2 16 p e i t e i y 3 2 carbon emissions as for carbon emissions here co2 and n2o released during the course of agricultural raw materials production indirect carbon emissions and the kiwifruit planting direct carbon emissions are considered therein carbon dioxide is the main contributor to greenhouse effect safa and samarasinghe 2012 one policy option that could reduce carbon emissions from agriculture is to promote commodities with the lowest intensity of carbon emissions to examine this option it is essential to estimate carbon emission per unit of product as proposed by verge et al 2009 in this study direct carbon emissions are from planting stage such as labor fuel combustion nitrogen fertilizer use etc indirect carbon emissions come from the transportation and storage of agricultural materials and their production processes mostashari rad et al 2019 carbon emissions are calculated by multiplying the amount of one kind of input item by its related emission factor as shown in table 2 the specific accounting methods for indirect and direct carbon emissions are described as follows 3 2 1 carbon emission amounting 1 indirect carbon emissions in this study indirect carbon emissions are mainly from agricultural materials production it can be calculated using eq 17 17 c e i d i 1 n a l i d c e c i d where ceid is the carbon emission of i th agricultural material production kg co2 eq alid is amount of i th agricultural material used kwh for electricity kg for chemical fertilizers pesticide and fuels cecid is the carbon emission factor of i th agricultural material production as shown in table 2 2 direct carbon emissions in this study direct carbon emission sources including diesel gasoline combustion labor activities nitrogen fertilizer application and organic fertilizer application and it can be computed using eq 18 18 c e d i 1 m a l d i c e c d i where ced is the carbon emission from crop planting kg co2 eq ald i is amount of i th agricultural material used cecd i is the carbon emission factor of i th agricultural material used in crop production as shown in table 2 finally the annual carbon emissions was obtained by summing the direct and indirect carbon emissions according to eq 19 19 c e t c e i d c e d 3 2 2 carbon emission intensity here the indicator i e carbon emission intensity cei kg co2 eq kg is proposed to describe carbon emission per unit product output and it is defined as total carbon emissions co2 equivalent divided by annual kiwifruit output and it can be calculated using eq 20 20 c e i i c e t i y i where ceii refers to carbon emission intensity of the i th planting system kg co2 eq kg ceti refers to the annual carbon emission from the i th planting system co2 eq yr yi stands for annual product output of the i th planting system t product yr the smaller index value means the lower carbon emission intensity of a system 3 3 co benefit index to promote comprehensive performance of agricultural production a planting system should have higher environmental sustainability level esi lower pollutant emissions impact intensity pei and smaller carbon emission intensity ceuy based on average level of this industry which can be described using the index co benefit index cbi therefore this index is positively related to esi but negatively related to pei and cei to normalize indicator values measured in different units average value of each indicator of an industry is adopted as a reference value of this industry and then cbi can be calculated through eq 21 21 c b i i e s i i e s i a v p e i i p e i a v c e i i c e i a v where esii peii and ceii refer to indicator values of emergy sustainability index pollutant emissions impact intensity and carbon emission intensity of the i th system respectively esiav peiav and ceiav refer to average indicator values of emergy sustainability index pollutant emissions impact intensity and carbon emission intensity of the production systems in study accordingly here referring to average indicator values of the four planting systems this index is affected by resource structure and efficiency cultivation management levels etc the larger index value of cbi means the higher co benefit degree of the i th system among its resource efficiency and resource structure its pollutant control and carbon emission reduction based on the average level of this industry to further investigate the degree of influence of one indicator on the cbi the id indicator is proposed and it is calculated using eq 22 according to ref cao et al 2022 22 i d i c b i i b c b i i a c b i i b where idi refers to the degree of influence of the i th indicator on the cbi cbii b and cbii a represents the indicator value of the cbi before and after considering the i th indicator respectively the larger the id indicator value the larger the contribution of one indicator to the cbi when the value of id 0 the larger the absolute value of id the greater the adverse influence of an indicator on the cbi when the value of id 0 and it indicates no effect of an indicator on the cbi when the value of id 0 3 4 data sources and statistical tools among the four cases the basic data of sxps came from ref wang 2018 the basic data of scps were collected through our field survey the basic data of itps derived from ref cerutti et al 2013 and the basic data of irps were referred to ref mostashari rad et al 2020 the corresponding unit emergy values were cited from related references shown in supplementary materials sms and they were all corrected to the baseline 12 0e24 sej yr microsoft excel 2021 was used for data processing and charting and emergy flow diagrams were accomplished in microsoft powerpoint 2021 4 results and discussions 4 1 emergy flows to refine the body text detailed statistic information of emergy evaluation of the four cases were given in sms4 7 and their emergy flows were summarized in fig 4 for sxps total emergy input is 4 01e 16 sej yr 1 to which local renewable input local nonrenewable input purchased renewable input and purchased nonrenewable input contributes 1 40 2 02 7 30 and 89 28 respectively furthermore purchased renewable input mainly comes from farmyard manure fym 5 98 followed by operating costs 0 87 purchased nonrenewable input is mainly derived from operating costs 42 88 followed by compound fertilizer 38 64 investment costs 3 49 and fym 2 82 orderly for scps total emergy input is 2 61e 16 sej yr 1 to which local renewable input local nonrenewable input purchased renewable input and purchased nonrenewable input contributes 2 93 6 00 3 91 and 87 16 respectively furthermore purchased renewable input mainly derived from organic fertilizer 2 04 followed by operating costs 1 15 and irrigation water 0 52 purchased nonrenewable input is mainly derived from operating costs 56 22 followed by compound fertilizer 15 37 organic fertilizer 8 15 and investment costs 5 35 orderly for itps total emergy input is 1 99e 16 sej yr 1 to which local renewable input local nonrenewable input purchased renewable input and purchased nonrenewable input contributes 3 25 3 68 5 75 and 87 32 respectively furthermore purchased renewable input mainly comes from organic fertilizer 4 51 followed by irrigation water 0 68 and operating costs 0 25 for purchased nonrenewable input compound fertilizer contributes the largest 34 01 to it followed by organic fertilizer 18 06 operating costs 12 04 plastic 7 22 and investment costs 7 02 accordingly for irps total emergy input is 1 27e 16 sej yr 1 to which local renewable input local nonrenewable input purchased renewable input and purchased nonrenewable input contributes 6 03 1 60 6 11 and 86 26 respectively furthermore purchased renewable input is mainly composed of fym 3 68 followed by irrigation water 1 06 and operating costs 1 02 for purchased nonrenewable input contribution of operating costs is the largest 50 19 followed by investment costs 11 01 nitrogen fertilizer 9 83 phosphate fertilizer 4 32 diesel 2 78 and machinery 2 69 orderly as shown in table 3 total emergy input shows trends of sxps scps itps irps compared with irps total emergy input of sxps scps and itps increases by 2 16 times 1 06 times and 56 69 respectively which means much higher emergy intensity of the two kiwifruit planting systems in china generally purchased nonrenewable resources more than 86 was the highest among the four systems which illustrated the high dependence of kiwifruit planting systems on this kind of resources also illustrated by lu et al 2009 among the four systems share of f1n follows trends of sxps itps scps irps sxps has the largest percentage of purchased non renewable resources mainly due to high chemical fertilizer inputs especially compound fertilizer inputs and high labor inputs to pursue high yield in this region local growers could overuse chemical fertilizers irps has the smallest share of f1n among the four systems showing its lowest dependence on purchased nonrenewable resources especially chemical fertilizers and labor inputs here the difference in total emergy inputs between sxps and scps is mainly due to the higher use of fertilizers and pesticides in shaanxi than that in sichuan some scholars found that the amount of fertilizer applied varied widely and unevenly among different kiwifruit orchards in shaanxi generally overuse of fertilization was serious and more than 90 of farmers applied unreasonable amounts of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium fertilizers in this region lai et al 2011 in addition lu 2017 found that the average amount of chemical fertilizer used in kiwifruit orchards in shaanxi province was more than twice the recommended amount with more than 80 of orchards applying excessive amounts of nitrogen and more than 50 of orchards applying excessive amounts of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers this shows that excessive fertilizer use is a common problem in the management of kiwifruit orchards in shaanxi due to the lack of a reasonable and efficient fertilization method that can guide farmers in nutrient management meanwhile it is found that two kiwifruit planting systems from china have much smaller share of machinery input relative to italy and iran 0 35 and 0 24 for scps and sxps vs 3 65 and 2 69 for itps and irps respectively showing lower level of mechanization of chinese kiwifruit planting as for labor input its share follows trends of scps 62 83 irps 62 42 sxps 47 31 itps 19 45 meaning much higher labor intensity in kiwifruit planting in china and iran china s shaanxi and sichuan provinces are more densely populated areas where more farmers have been engaged in kiwifruit cultivation with small scale those farmers carry out planting activities on their fields basically through manual operations as a result all these result in the low level of mechanization and the high labor intensity although the iranian kiwifruit planting has higher share of labor input its absolute emergy amount of labor input is much smaller than that of the two systems in china because the former has much lower total emergy input than the latter 4 2 pollution emissions impacts as shown in table 3 for extra ecological services among the four cases sxps ranks the first followed by scps and itps and irps ranks the last for the four cases the extra ecological services are mainly used to dilute total phosphorus discharged in water body followed by total nitrogen discharged in water body as shown in table 4 the emergy losses show trends of sxps itps irps scps for the four systems the emergy losses were mainly caused by nh3 emission followed by co2 and other air emissions have little contribution so nh3 and co2 should be emphasized for the four systems as shown in fig 5 sxps had the highest emissions impact 7 16e 15 sej yr of which the ecological services and emergy losses accounted for 97 86 and 2 14 respectively the total emissions impact of itps was 3 14e 15 sej yr of which 97 71 and 2 29 were ecological services and emergy losses respectively the total emissions impact of scps was 1 86e 15 sej yr of which 97 52 and 2 48 were ecological services and emergy value losses respectively the lowest emission impact was found in irps 5 88e 14 sej yr therein ecological services and emergy loss contribute 91 75 and 8 25 respectively generally the pollution emissions impacts of the four systems are mainly from ecological services mainly used for diluting total phosphorus discharged in water body therefore the key to reduce the extra ecological service is to improve the utilization efficiency of p fertilizer in terms of emergy losses nh3 was the largest contributor in the four systems sxps 87 58 scps 75 16 itps 81 89 and irps 51 55 followed by co 12 48 in sxps 23 97 in scps 17 83 in itps and 27 84 in irps therein nh3 emission mainly comes from the nitrogen fertilizers used in the kiwifruit planting so more attention should be paid to the efficient use of nitrogen fertilizers comparatively speaking sxps has the highest emissions impact among the four systems because it uses the most fertilizer compared to the other three systems irps on the other hand uses the least n fertilizer and thus has the lowest emissions impact the results show that emissions impacts mainly derive from the improper use of chemical fertilizers therefore to reduce the impact of emissions improving fertilizer utilization efficiency while ensuring kiwifruit yield is the key issue 4 3 greenhouse gasses emissions as shown in fig 6 sxps has the largest total carbon emission with 4542 10 kg co2 eq ha followed by itps 3043 13 co2 eq ha scps 2642 63 kg co2 eq ha and irps 2398 67 kg co2 eq ha orderly compared with irps sxps and itps as well as scps rises by 89 36 26 87 and 10 17 respectively for sxps its carbon emissions are mainly from fertilizer 58 90 followed by labor 29 19 electricity 5 42 etc for scps labor produces the most carbon emissions 56 59 followed by fertilizer 26 29 electricity 9 31 and gasoline combustion 4 93 and others in itps fertilizers 38 56 is the largest contributor to total carbon emissions flowed by pesticides 33 12 labor 15 88 and electricity 10 32 and others accordingly irps has the lowest carbon emissions which are mainly from labor 42 20 followed by fertilizers 31 86 diesel combustion 13 06 and electricity 11 28 in order in a word carbon emissions mainly come from the use of fertilizers and labor in kiwifruit cropping systems here carbon emissions per unit land are comparable to related studies such as 3 75 4 25 t co2 eq ha in italy rossi et al 2021 3 95 5 38 t co2 eq ha in new zealand müller et al 2015 as shown in fig 7 and the cei results show the same trend as the total carbon emissions per area with the highest carbon emission intensity appearing in sxps 0 16 followed by itps 0 15 and scps 0 12 and irps ranks the last 0 11 compared with irps cei value of sxps itps and scps rises by 45 45 36 36 and 9 09 respectively as two of main carbon emission sources fertilizers and labor should be paid more attention to in kiwifruit planting in the future especially for china here the presented indicator values are close to related research such as 0 13 0 16 kg co2 eq kg fruit in italy baudino et al 2017 meanwhile this study shows that in terms of carbon emission intensity the kiwifruit planting in italy has no advantages compared with iran and china and it also has the worst overall ranking among the major fruit production in this country cerutti et al 2013 4 4 emergy based indicators emergy indicator values of the four systems were exhibited in fig 8 in terms of the indicator uev irps had the highest resource efficiency 2 09e 11sej kg followed by scps 4 32e 11sej kg and sxps 7 49e 11sej kg and the resource efficiency of itps 8 10e 11sej kg is the lowest the highest resource efficiency of irps is mainly derived from its lowest total emergy input per unit of area in contrast the lowest kiwifruit yield per unit area adversely affects resource efficiency of itps for the indicator r irps performs the best with 12 14 followed by itps 9 00 and sxps 8 70 scps 6 84 has the worst resource structure because this system has much bigger share of economic input than the other three systems operation cost furthermore it is found that most of renewable input is derived from imported inputs especially for sxps and itps results of eyr reflect that scps had the highest economic benefit or competition ability 1 10 followed by irps 1 08 and itps 1 07 and sxps has the lowest economic benefit or competition ability 1 04 however the differences among the four kiwifruit planting systems only range between 2 88 5 77 relative to sxps generally they have low economic benefit due to high dependence on imported resources 91 for the elr indicator it follows trends of scps 13 65 sxps 10 48 itps 10 09 irps 7 26 and the differences among the four kiwifruit planting systems alter between 38 90 88 04 relative to irps therein scps has the highest environmental load mainly due to the highest share of purchased non renewable inputs in contrast irps has the lowest environmental load mainly due to its smallest share of purchased nonrenewable resources regarding the index esi the irps has the highest sustainability level 0 15 followed by itps 0 11 sxps 0 10 and scps ranks the last 0 08 mainly stemming from its highest environmental load however all the four systems are not sustainable in the long term mainly due to their high dependence on non renewable resources the results from the indicator pei illustrate that sxps has the largest pollutant emissions impact per unit product 2 54e 14 sej t followed by itps 1 58e 14 sej t and scps 8 29e 13 sej t and irps ranks the last 2 56e 13 sej t the differences among the other three kiwifruit planting systems range between 2 23 times 8 92 times relative to irps moreover it was found that total phosphorus discharge from the fertilizer used in the four systems is the main contributor to their pollutant emissions impact especially compound fertilizer for sxps according to the ratio of pei to uev it is found that pollutant emissions have the largest adverse impact on sxps followed by itps and scps and the irps ranks the last consequently low resource efficiency of agricultural materials especially chemical fertilizers not only raises economic cost of kiwifruit planting due to resources waste but also incurs adverse environmental impacts 4 5 cbi as shown in fig 9 the values of cbi follow trends of irps scps itps sxps cbi value of irps scps and itps is 21 70 times 3 32 times and 1 85 times that of sxps respectively so the synergy degree of irps is much larger than the other three systems which is derived from its highest sustainability level and its lowest pollutant emissions impact intensity in the four systems sxps has the lowest synergy degree 0 21 because it has the highest carbon emission intensity and the highest pollutant emissions impact intensity mainly rooting in the high share of chemical fertilizers the results of id table 8 show that in the irps pei contributes the largest to cbi followed by esi and cei regarding the scps the largest contribution to the cbi is pei followed by cei while esi has an obvious negative impact on the index value for the itps and sxps the largest negative impact on cbi comes from pei followed by cei and esi has slightly adverse impact on this index to strengthen the comprehensive performance improvement of the resource efficiency and resource structure should be further concerned for the scps itps and sxps should firstly emphasize its pollutant emission control and then carbon emission reduction generally irps has highest synergy degree among its emergy sustainability pollutant control and carbon emission reduction due to the lowest use of nonrenewable resources in terms of total amount and resource structure which shows the importance of improving the efficiency of agricultural materials use and resource structure and this system sets a good example for the other three planting systems for improving their comprehensive performance in the future 4 6 sensitivity analysis of emergy evaluation in the process of emergy evaluation the accuracy and representativeness of unit emergy values often affect the evaluation results in this study those uevs were cited from related databases and references however some uevs could not completely match different countries and regions which could bring some uncertainty to confirm the reliability of the study results this study implements sensitivity analysis through focusing on the impacts of main input categories on the emergy flows according to the structure of the emergy flows the top three emergy inputs in sxps scps and titps are operating cost compound fertilizer and organic fertilizer and the top three emergy inputs in irps are operating cost investment cost and nitrogen fertilizer this was done by assuming that the value of one of the three main inputs changing between 10 and 10 for each system and holding the other inputs constant and then comparing related indicator values with the baseline ones to observe their change scopes as shown in sm tables 8 11 increasing the emergy input of one of main items decreases the emergy yield ratio and enhances the environmental load rate thus weakens the emergy sustainability index in contrast decreasing the emergy input of one of main items raises the emergy yield ratio and reduces the environmental load rate thus enhances the emergy sustainability index however when the main items emergy inputs alter from 10 to 10 change rates of indicator values range between 7 33 7 33 4 62 5 27 4 22 4 22 and 4 99 5 63 respectively therefore changes of emergy inputs of main items have limited impacts on main emergy indicator values and thus the evaluation results can act as a reference for subsequent decision making 5 discussions and policy suggestions this study discovers that scps should properly enhance resource efficiency and improve resource structure and sxps and itps should pay special attention to environmental emissions to raise comprehensive performance of kiwifruit planting industry the following measures are presented for scps its resource structure of agricultural materials should be adjusted to raise its emergy sustainability the research results show that its low emergy sustainability level mainly roots in its high share of purchased non renewable input 87 16 mainly from operation cost 64 47 followed by compound fertilizer 17 63 furthermore 83 42 of the operation cost is derived from labor cost so it is necessary to reduce share of labor cost through raising mechanization level those agricultural machineries with low economic cost for precise fertilization irrigation and pesticide application are still lacking peng et al 2022 and related research and development should be promoted in the future in addition considering the lower share of organic fertilizers in the scps compared to the other systems shown in sm tables 4 7 raising share of organic fertilizers and or fym can also improve its resource structure and soil fertility and thus reduce the environmental load and enhance carbon sink mostashari rad et al 2020 and the following measures could be considered including 1 promoting the use of straw as fertilizer through improving the government led establishment of infrastructure related to straw collection storage and utilization ren et al 2019 and 2 extension of the application of livestock and poultry manure this measure not only can reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and improve the quality of soil but also mitigate environmental pollution from livestock and poultry breeding industry zhang et al 2021 related publicity efforts can be taken to promote the use of farmyard manure including raising farmers awareness through training field trips and distribution of pamphlets bagheri et al 2019 increasing temporary subsidies for growers who use manure formulating related integrated planning through combining kiwifruit planting with livestock breeding etc for sxps environmental emissions should be further reduced to raise their comprehensive performance the study illustrates that the factors hindering its synergy degree mainly come from pollutant emissions impacts followed by carbon emissions therein pollutant emissions impacts are mainly from total phosphorus discharged in water body and hu 2017 thought the fertilization amount of p fertilizer in this region could be reduced by about 96 through scientific fertilization methods carbon emissions of this system mainly derived from compound fertilizer 58 90 followed by labor 29 19 to reduce carbon emissions sxps should take following measures firstly its amount of organic fertilizers could be raised by about 2 times hu 2017 based on the existing level secondly local government departments should take active measures to guide kiwifruit growers to scientifically use fertilizers jia et al 2013 finally this system could mitigate carbon emissions from labor use through its raising mechanization level for itps it should also cut its environmental emissions for improving comprehensive performance the main factors affecting its synergy degree are rooted in pollutant emissions impacts followed by carbon emissions therein its pollutant emissions impacts mainly derive from total phosphorus discharged in water body and its carbon emissions are mainly caused by compound fertilizer and pesticides therefore besides controlling total phosphorus discharged and carbon emissions from compound fertilizer carbon emissions from pesticides should be emphasized in the future finally the kiwi planting industry still needs to further enhance its sustainability in the future although some differences exist among performance indicators of the four kiwi planting systems they are not sustainable in the long run due to great dependence on purchased non renewable inputs especially chemical fertilizers and labor cost and low utilization rate of fertilizers besides the abovementioned measures other measures could be also considered in the future these measures include developing special fertilizers for kiwifruit planting for raising utilization rate of fertilizers cultivation of new kiwifruit varieties for improving the economic benefit baudino et al 2017 intensive management for strengthening the comprehensive performance etc therein intensive management related measures include 1 enlarging scale of kiwi planting through merging those small scale orchards based on local related integrated planning of kiwifruit planting with livestock breeding 2 introduction of some advanced intelligent systems for insect prevention and control irrigation and fertilization etc and 3 developing a set of life cycle based integrated management software through considering resource and environmental as well as economic performances for optimizing the operation and management seidel sterzik et al 2018 soltanali et al 2017 6 conclusion this study compared the comprehensive performance of four kiwifruit planting systems in the three countries using the proposed integrated approach the main findings are summarized as follows 1 carbon emission intensity embodies trends of sxps 0 16 itps 0 15 scps 0 12 irps 0 11 for sxps and itps fertilizer is the largest contributor to carbon emissions however labor contributes the most to carbon emissions for scps and irps 2 sxps has the largest pollutant emissions impact per unit product 2 54e 14 sej t followed by itps 1 58e 14 sej t and scps 8 29e 13 sej t and irps ranks the last 2 56e 13 sej t which mainly comes from total phosphorus discharged into water body followed by nh3 emitted in the air 3 emergy sustainability reveals trends of irps itps sxps scps mainly due to different environmental load rates which depends on share of nonrenewable resources generally the four systems are not sustainable in the long term due to their high dependence on nonrenewable resources especially l s and chemical fertilizers 4 results of co benefit index reflect that irps has the best comprehensive performance due to its highest resource efficiency and reasonable resource structure followed by scps itps and sxps accordingly in summary improvement of utilization efficiency of chemical fertilizers and resource structure are urgent for kiwifruit planting the innovation of this study is to establish an integrated approach for comparing the comprehensive performance of kiwifruit planting systems by combining emergy sustainability index pollutant emissions impact and carbon emission intensity and it can also act as one of decision making tools for other crop production systems however emergy loss from solid wastes disposal and pollutant emissions impacts on biotic components have been neglected due to the lack of relevant basic data which could influence the study results to some degrees in addition although related suggestions proposed by this study can address corresponding issues discovered their comprehensive impacts on kiwifruit planting systems are not very clear all these issues still need further investigation in the future credit authorship contribution statement qiuwen

24151,extensive kiwifruit farming patterns worldwide are generating increasing environmental stress and thus hindering their sustainability comprehensive performance based on resource efficiency and resource structure pollutant emissions impact and carbon emission is still not clear for this planting system therefore this study proposes a comprehensive evaluation of kiwifruit planting systems by combining emergy analysis with carbon emission accounting method the proposed approach not only considers the resource efficiency and resource structure of this planting system as well as its carbon emission intensity but also describe tradeoffs among emergy sustainability pollutant emissions impacts and carbon emission intensity using the proposed index co benefit index cbi finally four kiwifruit planting systems from china kiwifruit planting system in sichuan province scps and kiwifruit planting system in shaanxi sxps italy kiwifruit planting system in italy itps and iran kiwifruit planting system in iran irps as case studies are investigated using the presented approach the study results show that 1 carbon emission intensity co2 eq kg product embodies trends of sxps 0 16 itps 0 15 scps 0 12 irps 0 11 2 pollutant emissions impact intensity follows the trends of sxps 2 54e 14 itps 1 58e 14 scps 8 29e 13 irps 2 56e 13 in units of sej t product 3 environmental sustainability reveals trends of irps itps sxps scps mainly due to different environmental load rates generally the four systems are not sustainable in the long term due to their high dependence on nonrenewable resources especially labor and services l s and chemical fertilizers 4 results of co benefit index reflect the trends of irps scps itps sxps accordingly some targeted measures are proposed for scps sxps and itps considering low sustainability level it is urgent for the four kiwifruit planting systems to further improve their utilization rate of chemical fertilizer and resource structure in the future keywords kiwifruit planting emergy analysis indicators pollutant emissions impacts carbon emission co benefit index 1 introduction kiwifruit as one kind of nutrient dense fruit has a reputation for promoting good health due to exceptionally high content of vitamin c and an array of other nutrients dietary fiber potassium vitamin e and folate etc as well as various bioactive components richardson et al 2018 as a primitive antioxidant it can neutralizes free radicals to avoid or reduce cell damages and related illness mostashari rad et al 2021 currently china produces about half of the total kiwifruit output in the world fao the food and agriculture organization 2021 but only 1 of which is exported therein shaanxi and sichuan provinces are the top two production areas in this country shaanxi statistical bureau 2021 china economic information network 2023 other countries with high production capacity of kiwifruit besides china include italy iran etc fao 2021 most of which is destined for export related resources and environmental issues have been more concerned in kiwifruit planting high kiwifruit yields in many countries are mainly sustained by large amounts of agricultural materials such as fertilizers pesticides and fossil resources etc which also aggravates pollutant emissions impacts abdi et al 2012 and global warming due to rising carbon emissions kouchaki penchah et al 2016 kiwi planting could adversely affect local groundwater and air quality lu et al 2016 found that the nitrate n accumulation in the 0 100 cm and 0 200 cm soil layers in kiwi orchards were 466 and 793 kg n ha 1 in the yujiahe catchment of shaanxi china respectively which poses a great risk for nitrate leaching and subsequent groundwater pollution gao et al 2021 revealed that intensive kiwi orchards caused higher n surplus in orchards than croplands 1206 vs 282 kg ha 1 yr 1 and the nitrate concentrations of 97 of groundwater samples exceeded the who standard in the northern slope region of the qinling mountains china nikkhah et al 2016 revealed that the amounts of air pollutant emissions of nh3 nox and so2 reached 2 00 0 30 and 0 15 kg t 1 kiwifruit respectively in guilan province iran based on a life cycle assessment li 2022 found that volatilization amount of 11 57 13 98 kg nh3 hm 2 in kiwi orchards in zhouzhi county s yujia river catchment in the middle of northern slope region of the qinling mountains meanwhile greenhouse effect derived from kiwi planting industry has been concerned some scholars have quantified carbon emissions of kiwi planting systems in some specific regions in several countries using life cycle assessment therein carbon source t co2 eq t 1 kiwifruit related studies include the packaging and transport of kiwifruit in new zealand ranging from 0 33 to 0 67 delivered to a store of japan and germany robertson et al 2014 0 14 0 22 in the bay of plenty new zealand müller et al 2015 0 15 0 32 in guilan province iran nikkhah et al 2016 mostashari rad et al 2020 0 11 0 14 a deliciosa in piedmont in italy baudino et al 2017 0 14 in campania southern italy pergola et al 2022 etc and all these issues will hinder sustainable kiwifruit production in the future browne et al 2011 related methods including life cycle assessment lca energy flow analysis efa and economic analysis eca etc have been adopted for the performance evaluation of cropping systems therein lca focuses on assessing the inputs outputs and potential environmental impacts of a product system over its life cycle for example lca was used for the environmental assessment of peach orchards in italy ingrao et al 2015 it revealed that there are multiple opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions from these orchards bacenetti et al 2016 assessed the environmental performance of organic rice cultivation in the pavia region northern italy using the lca to highlight the main environmental hotspots of organic rice planting in this area fusi et al 2014 applied the lca to assessment of the environmental consequences of rice production in vercelli district piedmont region northern italy to optimize different straw management strategies lca can evaluate the environmental impact of a product during its life cycle from resource and energy consumption and environmental emissions but it ignores the environmental contribution to social economy and it cannot evaluate the contribution of human labor to the crop production efa can describe the energy efficiency of a system during the course of energy conversion yuan and peng 2017 examined the trends of energy inputs and outputs in crop production in china from 1991 to 2012 using efa the study showed that china s government should increase investment in technology development and technological innovation adopt new policies to optimize the structure of crop production so as to promote the sustainable cropping system in the country montemurro et al 2020 compared different management strategies in a four year organic cropping system by efa two different living mulches with no till and green manure were compared with a cropping system without cover crop their results indicated that the introduction of the cover crop as living mulch combined with no till could be a powerful tool to enhance the sustainability without compromising the crop yields however efa only considers the flow and transformation of energy but ignore the contribution of natural inputs and the quality differences of different resources and energy sources which could reduce completeness of the analysis results eca measures the economic value of goods labor and services in the social economy in terms of their monetary value which mainly focuses on human contributions this method is often combined with lca to evaluate performance of systems for example chen et al 2021 used lca and eca to estimate the environmental impacts and economic benefit of three typical rice field rotation systems it was found that fertilizer diesel water electricity and fodder should be emphasized and related measures should be taken to improve resource use efficiency and reduce environmental emissions however eca could not provide complete policy making information due to ignorance of the environmental contribution to social economy compared with the abovementioned methods advantages of emergy analysis ema lies in 1 adopting a unified unit of measurement solar energy joules sej 2 considering the environmental contribution to social economy and 3 distinguishing quality differences of diverse resources and energy sources as well as labor and service odum 1988 therefore it can provide more complete information for decision making so far ema has been widely applied to evaluation of environmental sustainability of agricultural farming systems for example zhuang et al 2022 used ema to evaluate china s staple crop production systems wheat maize and rice and concluded that china has great potential to improve the sustainability of its staple crops production based on provincial data in china in 2016 zhao et al 2019 used this approach to analyze the environmental performance of the cucumber production system it was found that improving resource use efficiency using more clean energy sources and increasing mechanization would promote sustainable development of this cropping system xu et al 2021 used lca and ema to evaluate the tea production system in china and found that this system is a highly polluting industry its environmental impact can be greatly reduced by improving fertilizer use efficiency adopting new varieties and using renewable energy sources houshyar et al 2018 explored the environmental impacts of wheat and maize cropping systems through ema they found that the environmental loading rate of the maize production is much higher than that of wheat production zhang et al 2016 used ema to explore the integrated performance of crop systems in china it was found that from 2000 to 2010 crop production efficiency of china was improved slightly but its environmental load increased significantly to compare the sustainability levels of different agricultural practices from ecological and economic perspectives liu et al 2019a used ema to conduct a comprehensive assessment of straw repatriation and straw free maize soybean rotation systems in the central loess plateau region and they found that labor and renewable resource inputs have the main effects on the sustainability of crop production in china emergy accounting is also commonly used for comparisons of environmental performance among cropping systems of different countries for example ali et al 2019 compared the environmental stresses of crop production in pakistan and india using ema the main findings indicate that purchased renewable inputs e g irrigation water and purchased non renewable inputs e g agricultural labor are the largest contributors to total inputs in both countries and that india is more productive than pakistan although ema has been widely used to assess the sustainability of various crop production systems no studies have been found to assess the sustainability of kiwifruit farming systems using this approach which is not beneficial for this farming system to improve its comprehensive performance due to lacking full decision making information furthermore classic ema mainly concentrates on resource structure and resource efficiency of the system in study however it cannot provide pollutants impacts on human and the environment as well as carbon footprint related information which have been paid more attention to in the background of increasingly strict environmental supervision and carbon neutrality requirements therefore ema needs to be improved to integrate pollutant emissions impacts in its accounting framework zhang et al 2009 2018 meanwhile this method should be supplemented using carbon emission amounting method to provide carbon footprint related information pan et al 2022 in recent years due to the increase in kiwifruit output related resources and environmental issues have attracted the attention of several scholars around the world for example nikkhah et al 2016 applied lca and cobb douglas to investigate the environmental impacts of kiwifruit production in guilan province iran the results showed that the greatest environmental impact of this fruit production was eutrophication and that urea fertilization had a statistically significantly negative impact on kiwifruit yield nabavi pelesaraei et al 2016 used an artificial neural network approach to predict and conduct a sensitivity analysis of energy inputs and greenhouse gas emissions in three groups of kiwifruit orchards with different sizes in guilan province iran the results showed that diesel and nitrogen fertilizer were the most sensitive inputs for kiwifruit production and ghg emissions mohammadi et al 2010 used efa to examine the energy flows of inputs and outputs used in kiwifruit production it was found that energy inputs of human labor irrigation water total fertilizer and machinery contributed significantly to yield therein human labor energy had the highest impact on kiwifruit production however the abovementioned studies only focus on one single aspect e g energy inputs environmental impacts or greenhouse gas emissions which can lead to an incomplete information for policy making in addition to this existing studies have mainly focused on the environmental impact of kiwifruit cultivation however few studies have considered the environmental contribution to this cropping system and also not carried out comparison of comprehensive performance of different kiwifruit cropping systems based on their resource efficiency and resource structure pollutant emissions impacts and carbon emissions and all these should be fully investigated so as to provide more complete information for decision making for sustainable kiwifruit planting in the future for meeting increasingly strict environmental supervision and carbon emission regulation to attain full decision making information it is necessary to consider resource efficiency pollutant emissions impacts and ghg emissions simultaneously when comparing the comprehensive performance of different kiwifruit cropping systems to this end this study proposed a performance evaluation approach to compare the resource efficiency and resource structure pollution emissions impacts and ghg emission intensity as well as comprehensive performance using ema and greenhouse gas emission accounting methods as well as one compound index co benefit index cbi four kiwifruit planting systems from china iran and italy as study cases were evaluated using the presented approach the novelty of this study lies in 1 constructing one comprehensive performance evaluation approach for planting systems based on resources utilization and environmental emissions impacts as well as their relationship which can not only provide single information on resource structure and resource efficiency pollutant emissions impacts and carbon footprint but also give an overall conclusion for final decision making through integrating those single information and 2 providing beneficial suggestions for improving resource and environmental performance of kiwifruit farming as well as overall conclusions for final decision making the paper is structured as follows following section 1 section 2 describes the four study cases section 3 introduces the research approach and data sources section 4 presents the main results and carries out related discussions and section 5 makes policy recommendations finally the main conclusions are summarized in section 6 2 introduction of the study cases china has produced about 50 of the total kiwifruit output in the world during 2010 2020 fig 1 therein shaanxi and sichuan provinces contributes 51 39 and 17 70 to the output of this country shaanxi statistical bureau 2021 china economic information network 2023 besides china italy and iran are also two of countries with high production capacity of kiwifruit and they contribute 11 77 and 6 69 to total output in the world in the year 2020 respectively fig 1 therein the two districts considered in the two countries are the main kiwi planting areas so the four kiwi planting systems in the three countries have good representativeness and their locations are shown in fig 2 moreover detailed information on the four cases is introduced as follows 2 1 kiwi planting system in sichuan province scps scps is located in pujiang county between 103 19 103 41 e and 30 05 30 20 n sichuan province china this county belongs to the sichuan basin central subtropical monsoon humid climate zone wang et al 2020 the annual average temperature was 17 2 the annual average radiation is 86 02 kcal cm2 and the annual average rainfall was 1181 4 mm he 2019 these climate conditions are conducive for kiwifruit planting pujiang kiwifruit is a specialty of pujiang county sichuan province and it is also a national geographical indication product in china on december 23 2019 pujiang kiwifruit was selected as one of the top 100 iconic brands of china s agricultural products in 2016 planting area of kiwifruit in this county was 5 0 103 hectares its total output reached 5 7 104 tons and realized economic output of about 6 0 108 yuan wang and jiang 2017 generally pujiang kiwifruit planting system is representative in the world according to its output 2 2 kiwi planting system in shaanxi sxps sxps is located in zhouzhi county between the 107 39 108 37 e and 33 42 34 14 n shaanxi province china this county belongs to temperate sub humid continental monsoon climate with annual radiation of 109 68 kcal cm2 annual sunshine time of 1993 7 h and annual sunshine percentage of 41 the annual average temperature is 13 2 the annual average precipitation is 674 3 mm and the annual average wind speed is 1 3 m s this county was regarded as the kiwifruit hometown in china and certified as green food by the china green food development center according to local statistical data about 60 percent of fresh kiwifruit and 80 percent of dry kiwifruit comes from this county respectively in china therefore sxps still has very good representativeness in the world 2 3 kiwi planting system in iran irps iran ranks the seventh in the world according to its kiwifruit output guilan province is the second largest producer of kiwifruit in iran nabavi pelesaraei et al 2016 here irps is located in talesh city 37 33 38 16 n and 48 32 49 03 e guilan province iran the guilan province is located in the northern region of iran south of the caspian sea and it is one of the most important agricultural provinces in iran zareiforoush et al 2010 the annual average temperature and rainfall in talesh city is 19 c and 1585 mm respectively the annual average radiation is 752 71 kcal cm2 and the annual average wind speed is 2 64 m s the agricultural sector provides approximately 48 percent of direct employment in this city ministry of jihad e agriculture of iran 2014 2 4 kiwi planting system in italy itps italy is one of the main kiwifruit producers in the world testolin and ferguson 2009 itps is located in the piedmont region of northwest italy 44 40 n and 07 59 e with the annual average precipitation of 950 mm the annual average temperature of 11 9 c the annual average radiation of 121 63 kcal cm2 and the annual average wind speed of 1 3 m s to ease comparisons here one hectare of kiwifruit cultivation area is chosen the study did not make differences among diverse kiwifruit varieties because individual orchards tend to grow several kiwifruit varieties e g red heart yellow heart simultaneously and cannot attain related accurate data 3 methods 3 1 ema emergy theory was founded by odum in the 1980s odum 1988 liu et al 2019b and ema is an effective method to evaluate the resource efficiency and resource structure of a system through its extended analysis boundary from the environmental system to social economic system and thus it establishes a link between the human social system and the environment fang et al 2017 since any energy source on earth is derived from solar energy the solar energy joule is regarded as a metric to calculate the amount of solar energy contained in the energy flowing or stored by matter zhang et al 2016 the true value and contribution of different types and hierarchical levels of energy sources in the eco economic system can be measured and compared based on emergy as a result ema provides uniform metric for describing the flow of energy matter and currency in the system for objective evaluation of its environmental performance the emergy value of one resource or energy source is calculated by multiplying its quantity by the corresponding unit emergy value uev uev expressing solar emergy needed to provide 1 g j or of a product or service is a key parameter of the approach the emergy baseline as the basis for all emergy accounting is a reference in the process of emergy evaluation and it is the sum of the annual energy inputs of solar radiation energy tidal energy and geothermal energy on the earth brown and ulgiati 2016 at present five emergy baselines have emerged in emergy related research brown et al 2016 to keep consistence of results in a study this paper adopts the latest emergy baseline i e 12 0e 24 sej yr 1 brown et al 2016 here the emergy evaluation starts from agricultural materials and labor entering into the kiwifruit planting systems and ends with the products leaving the systems 3 1 1 system description of one kiwifruit planting system and its emergy flows fig 3 shows the emergy flow of one kiwifruit planting system its total emergy input comes from local renewable resources r1 such as sunlight wind and rain local non renewable resources n imported renewable resources f1r such as renewable part of investment and operating cost irc for l s and imported non renewable resources f1n such as electricity gasoline diesel nitrogen fertilizer phosphate fertilizer potash fertilizer compound fertilizer organic fertilizer insecticide fungicide plastic bagging mechanical equipment non renewable part of irc the proportion of renewable and nonrenewable parts of irc is approximately 0 02 and 0 98 respectively the national environmental accounting database https www emergy nead com home outputs include products y kiwifruit and pollutant emissions w such as so2 nox and nh3 and ghg emissions pollutant emissions could require ecological services r2 to dilute them to acceptable levels when they exceed local environmental capacity meanwhile they may also cause economic losses f2 before reaching their acceptable levels due to harming human health land occupation adversely affecting biodiversity 3 1 2 calculating pollutant emissions impacts to calculate pollutant emissions impacts amount of pollutant emissions should be firstly quantified and it can be calculated using eq 1 1 w i i 1 n a l i e f i where wi is the amount of the i th pollutant emission kg ali is amount of i th agricultural material efi is the emission factor of i th agricultural material as shown in table 1 in this study we used the method proposed by zhang et al 2009 to assess the impact of pollutant emissions 1 quantifying extra ecological services for diluting pollutant emissions ecological services are environmental self purification involving a series of physical chemical and biological processes zhang et al 2009 here due to the lack of other basic data only the dilution function provided by the atmospheric environment and the water bodies are considered in the process of crop planting some pollutants derived from use of a large number of chemical fertilizers pesticides etc will be discharged into the environment to make those emitted pollutants meet the relevant environmental quality standards the extra ecological service will be needed to dilute them the ecological services of diluting air and water pollutants are calculated using eq 2 2 m i d w i c i where mi refers to the amount of air or water needed for diluting pollutants kg d represents the density of air or water 1 23 kg m3 for air and 1 00e 03 kg m3 for water wi stands for the annual emission amount of the i th pollutant kg ci is the environmentally acceptable concentration of the i th pollutant next the emergy of the ecological service can be calculated using eqs 3 and 4 for diluting air pollutants and water pollutants respectively 3 r w air 1 2 m air v 2 t r air 4 r w water m water t r water where rw air rw water is the emergy of the ecological service used to dilute an air pollutant and one water pollutant sej yr respectively v stands for the annual mean wind speed m s from local meteorological statistic data trair denotes the uev of wind

baseline 12 0e 24 sej yr considering that one ecological service can dilute different types of pollutants in a given medium at the same time the sum of the maximum values of the two ecological services is taken as the emergy value of the final ecological service required as shown in eq 5 5 r 2 m a x r w a i r m a x r w w a t e r 2 quantifying emergy loss resulting from pollutant emissions pollutant emissions could harm the ecosystem and human health before they attain related environmental quality standards these potential losses mainly derive from the loss of natural capital by damaging biodiversity and economic losses by affecting human health f2 and land occupation zhang et al 2009 due to the lack of specific ecological parameters this study does not consider the damage caused by pollutants to the ecosystem and land occupation but only quantifies the impact of air pollutants on human health the disability adjusted life year daly can be used to measure the damage of pollutants to human health and it is a widely used method to evaluate human health risks and the quantification method is shown in eq 6 according to ref zhang et al 2018 6 f 2 i 1 n m i d a l y i τ h where f2 refers to the emergy loss in support of the affected human health sej yr i denotes the i th pollutant in the study mi refers to the mass of the i th pollutant kg yr daly stands for the eco

79e 11 sej cny τh 2 00e 16 sej person yr finally the total pollutant emissions impact tei can be summarized as sum of r2 and f2 3 1 3 the corresponding emergy based indicators the emergy based indicators reflect the resource structure and resource efficiency and can be used to compare the performance of systems from different perspectives according to the characteristics of the research systems the adopted indicators are depicted as follows 1 uev the indicator is equal to the total emergy input divided by the output of the product and it reflects the resource efficiency of the production system for different processes with the same similar products or services the lower the uev value the higher the resource efficiency pulselli et al 2011 and this indicator can be calculated using eq 10 10 uev n r 1 f 1 r f 1 n y where uev is the unit emergy value of the product service sej kg n is the emergy of local nonrenewable inputs sej yr r1 is the emergy of local renewable inputs sej yr f1r is the emergy of purchased renewable inputs sej yr f1n is the emergy of purchased nonrenewable inputs sej yr y is annual product yield kg 2 renewability percent r this indicator equals to the ratio of renewable input to total emergy input the larger indicator value means the more reasonable resource structure and thus can reduce the environmental load of the system and it can be calculated using eq 11 11 r r 1 f 1 r n r 1 f 1 r f 1 n 100 3 emergy yield ratio eyr eyr is defined as the ratio of total emergy input to imported emergy the larger indicator value reflects the stronger competitiveness ability or better economic benefit of the system and it can be calculated using eq 12 12 eyr n r 1 f 1 r f 1 n f 1 r f 1 n 4 environmental loading ratio elr elr is the ratio of the total emergy of non renewable inputs to the total emergy of renewable inputs and it indicates the potential pressure on the environment a bigger indicator value indicates a larger pressure on the environment and it can be quantified by using the eq 13 13 elr n f 1 n r 1 f 1 r 5 emergy sustainable index esi the esi is defined as the ratio of the eyr to the elr which reflects the output per unit of environmental load when esi 1 the system is unsustainable in the long run when 1 esi 5 the system is sustainable in the medium term when 5 esi 10 the system is sustainable in the long run when esi 10 the system is underdeveloped it can be quantified using eq 14 14 esi eyr rlr 6 pollution emissions impact intensity pei sej t product extra ecological services and adverse emissions impacts on human and the environment will potentially influence the comprehensive performance of one system here the indicator pei was proposed to describe the environmental impact of the kiwifruit planting systems this indicator is defined as the total pollutant emissions impact tei sej yr shown in eq 15 divided by the annual product output y t product yr as shown in eq 16 the larger indicator value means the stronger pollutants impact intensity 15 t e i r 2 f 2 16 p e i t e i y 3 2 carbon emissions as for carbon emissions here co2 and n2o released during the course of agricultural raw materials production indirect carbon emissions and the kiwifruit planting direct carbon emissions are considered therein carbon dioxide is the main contributor to greenhouse effect safa and samarasinghe 2012 one policy option that could reduce carbon emissions from agriculture is to promote commodities with the lowest intensity of carbon emissions to examine this option it is essential to estimate carbon emission per unit of product as proposed by verge et al 2009 in this study direct carbon emissions are from planting stage such as labor fuel combustion nitrogen fertilizer use etc indirect carbon emissions come from the transportation and storage of agricultural materials and their production processes mostashari rad et al 2019 carbon emissions are calculated by multiplying the amount of one kind of input item by its related emission factor as shown in table 2 the specific accounting methods for indirect and direct carbon emissions are described as follows 3 2 1 carbon emission amounting 1 indirect carbon emissions in this study indirect carbon emissions are mainly from agricultural materials production it can be calculated using eq 17 17 c e i d i 1 n a l i d c e c i d where ceid is the carbon emission of i th agricultural material production kg co2 eq alid is amount of i th agricultural material used kwh for electricity kg for chemical fertilizers pesticide and fuels cecid is the carbon emission factor of i th agricultural material production as shown in table 2 2 direct carbon emissions in this study direct carbon emission sources including diesel gasoline combustion labor activities nitrogen fertilizer application and organic fertilizer application and it can be computed using eq 18 18 c e d i 1 m a l d i c e c d i where ced is the carbon emission from crop planting kg co2 eq ald i is amount of i th agricultural material used cecd i is the carbon emission factor of i th agricultural material used in crop production as shown in table 2 finally the annual carbon emissions was obtained by summing the direct and indirect carbon emissions according to eq 19 19 c e t c e i d c e d 3 2 2 carbon emission intensity here the indicator i e carbon emission intensity cei kg co2 eq kg is proposed to describe carbon emission per unit product output and it is defined as total carbon emissions co2 equivalent divided by annual kiwifruit output and it can be calculated using eq 20 20 c e i i c e t i y i where ceii refers to carbon emission intensity of the i th planting system kg co2 eq kg ceti refers to the annual carbon emission from the i th planting system co2 eq yr yi stands for annual product output of the i th planting system t product yr the smaller index value means the lower carbon emission intensity of a system 3 3 co benefit index to promote comprehensive performance of agricultural production a planting system should have higher environmental sustainability level esi lower pollutant emissions impact intensity pei and smaller carbon emission intensity ceuy based on average level of this industry which can be described using the index co benefit index cbi therefore this index is positively related to esi but negatively related to pei and cei to normalize indicator values measured in different units average value of each indicator of an industry is adopted as a reference value of this industry and then cbi can be calculated through eq 21 21 c b i i e s i i e s i a v p e i i p e i a v c e i i c e i a v where esii peii and ceii refer to indicator values of emergy sustainability index pollutant emissions impact intensity and carbon emission intensity of the i th system respectively esiav peiav and ceiav refer to average indicator values of emergy sustainability index pollutant emissions impact intensity and carbon emission intensity of the production systems in study accordingly here referring to average indicator values of the four planting systems this index is affected by resource structure and efficiency cultivation management levels etc the larger index value of cbi means the higher co benefit degree of the i th system among its resource efficiency and resource structure its pollutant control and carbon emission reduction based on the average level of this industry to further investigate the degree of influence of one indicator on the cbi the id indicator is proposed and it is calculated using eq 22 according to ref cao et al 2022 22 i d i c b i i b c b i i a c b i i b where idi refers to the degree of influence of the i th indicator on the cbi cbii b and cbii a represents the indicator value of the cbi before and after considering the i th indicator respectively the larger the id indicator value the larger the contribution of one indicator to the cbi when the value of id 0 the larger the absolute value of id the greater the adverse influence of an indicator on the cbi when the value of id 0 and it indicates no effect of an indicator on the cbi when the value of id 0 3 4 data sources and statistical tools among the four cases the basic data of sxps came from ref wang 2018 the basic data of scps were collected through our field survey the basic data of itps derived from ref cerutti et al 2013 and the basic data of irps were referred to ref mostashari rad et al 2020 the corresponding unit emergy values were cited from related references shown in supplementary materials sms and they were all corrected to the baseline 12 0e24 sej yr microsoft excel 2021 was used for data processing and charting and emergy flow diagrams were accomplished in microsoft powerpoint 2021 4 results and discussions 4 1 emergy flows to refine the body text detailed statistic information of emergy evaluation of the four cases were given in sms4 7 and their emergy flows were summarized in fig 4 for sxps total emergy input is 4 01e 16 sej yr 1 to which local renewable input local nonrenewable input purchased renewable input and purchased nonrenewable input contributes 1 40 2 02 7 30 and 89 28 respectively furthermore purchased renewable input mainly comes from farmyard manure fym 5 98 followed by operating costs 0 87 purchased nonrenewable input is mainly derived from operating costs 42 88 followed by compound fertilizer 38 64 investment costs 3 49 and fym 2 82 orderly for scps total emergy input is 2 61e 16 sej yr 1 to which local renewable input local nonrenewable input purchased renewable input and purchased nonrenewable input contributes 2 93 6 00 3 91 and 87 16 respectively furthermore purchased renewable input mainly derived from organic fertilizer 2 04 followed by operating costs 1 15 and irrigation water 0 52 purchased nonrenewable input is mainly derived from operating costs 56 22 followed by compound fertilizer 15 37 organic fertilizer 8 15 and investment costs 5 35 orderly for itps total emergy input is 1 99e 16 sej yr 1 to which local renewable input local nonrenewable input purchased renewable input and purchased nonrenewable input contributes 3 25 3 68 5 75 and 87 32 respectively furthermore purchased renewable input mainly comes from organic fertilizer 4 51 followed by irrigation water 0 68 and operating costs 0 25 for purchased nonrenewable input compound fertilizer contributes the largest 34 01 to it followed by organic fertilizer 18 06 operating costs 12 04 plastic 7 22 and investment costs 7 02 accordingly for irps total emergy input is 1 27e 16 sej yr 1 to which local renewable input local nonrenewable input purchased renewable input and purchased nonrenewable input contributes 6 03 1 60 6 11 and 86 26 respectively furthermore purchased renewable input is mainly composed of fym 3 68 followed by irrigation water 1 06 and operating costs 1 02 for purchased nonrenewable input contribution of operating costs is the largest 50 19 followed by investment costs 11 01 nitrogen fertilizer 9 83 phosphate fertilizer 4 32 diesel 2 78 and machinery 2 69 orderly as shown in table 3 total emergy input shows trends of sxps scps itps irps compared with irps total emergy input of sxps scps and itps increases by 2 16 times 1 06 times and 56 69 respectively which means much higher emergy intensity of the two kiwifruit planting systems in china generally purchased nonrenewable resources more than 86 was the highest among the four systems which illustrated the high dependence of kiwifruit planting systems on this kind of resources also illustrated by lu et al 2009 among the four systems share of f1n follows trends of sxps itps scps irps sxps has the largest percentage of purchased non renewable resources mainly due to high chemical fertilizer inputs especially compound fertilizer inputs and high labor inputs to pursue high yield in this region local growers could overuse chemical fertilizers irps has the smallest share of f1n among the four systems showing its lowest dependence on purchased nonrenewable resources especially chemical fertilizers and labor inputs here the difference in total emergy inputs between sxps and scps is mainly due to the higher use of fertilizers and pesticides in shaanxi than that in sichuan some scholars found that the amount of fertilizer applied varied widely and unevenly among different kiwifruit orchards in shaanxi generally overuse of fertilization was serious and more than 90 of farmers applied unreasonable amounts of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium fertilizers in this region lai et al 2011 in addition lu 2017 found that the average amount of chemical fertilizer used in kiwifruit orchards in shaanxi province was more than twice the recommended amount with more than 80 of orchards applying excessive amounts of nitrogen and more than 50 of orchards applying excessive amounts of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers this shows that excessive fertilizer use is a common problem in the management of kiwifruit orchards in shaanxi due to the lack of a reasonable and efficient fertilization method that can guide farmers in nutrient management meanwhile it is found that two kiwifruit planting systems from china have much smaller share of machinery input relative to italy and iran 0 35 and 0 24 for scps and sxps vs 3 65 and 2 69 for itps and irps respectively showing lower level of mechanization of chinese kiwifruit planting as for labor input its share follows trends of scps 62 83 irps 62 42 sxps 47 31 itps 19 45 meaning much higher labor intensity in kiwifruit planting in china and iran china s shaanxi and sichuan provinces are more densely populated areas where more farmers have been engaged in kiwifruit cultivation with small scale those farmers carry out planting activities on their fields basically through manual operations as a result all these result in the low level of mechanization and the high labor intensity although the iranian kiwifruit planting has higher share of labor input its absolute emergy amount of labor input is much smaller than that of the two systems in china because the former has much lower total emergy input than the latter 4 2 pollution emissions impacts as shown in table 3 for extra ecological services among the four cases sxps ranks the first followed by scps and itps and irps ranks the last for the four cases the extra ecological services are mainly used to dilute total phosphorus discharged in water body followed by total nitrogen discharged in water body as shown in table 4 the emergy losses show trends of sxps itps irps scps for the four systems the emergy losses were mainly caused by nh3 emission followed by co2 and other air emissions have little contribution so nh3 and co2 should be emphasized for the four systems as shown in fig 5 sxps had the highest emissions impact 7 16e 15 sej yr of which the ecological services and emergy losses accounted for 97 86 and 2 14 respectively the total emissions impact of itps was 3 14e 15 sej yr of which 97 71 and 2 29 were ecological services and emergy losses respectively the total emissions impact of scps was 1 86e 15 sej yr of which 97 52 and 2 48 were ecological services and emergy value losses respectively the lowest emission impact was found in irps 5 88e 14 sej yr therein ecological services and emergy loss contribute 91 75 and 8 25 respectively generally the pollution emissions impacts of the four systems are mainly from ecological services mainly used for diluting total phosphorus discharged in water body therefore the key to reduce the extra ecological service is to improve the utilization efficiency of p fertilizer in terms of emergy losses nh3 was the largest contributor in the four systems sxps 87 58 scps 75 16 itps 81 89 and irps 51 55 followed by co 12 48 in sxps 23 97 in scps 17 83 in itps and 27 84 in irps therein nh3 emission mainly comes from the nitrogen fertilizers used in the kiwifruit planting so more attention should be paid to the efficient use of nitrogen fertilizers comparatively speaking sxps has the highest emissions impact among the four systems because it uses the most fertilizer compared to the other three systems irps on the other hand uses the least n fertilizer and thus has the lowest emissions impact the results show that emissions impacts mainly derive from the improper use of chemical fertilizers therefore to reduce the impact of emissions improving fertilizer utilization efficiency while ensuring kiwifruit yield is the key issue 4 3 greenhouse gasses emissions as shown in fig 6 sxps has the largest total carbon emission with 4542 10 kg co2 eq ha followed by itps 3043 13 co2 eq ha scps 2642 63 kg co2 eq ha and irps 2398 67 kg co2 eq ha orderly compared with irps sxps and itps as well as scps rises by 89 36 26 87 and 10 17 respectively for sxps its carbon emissions are mainly from fertilizer 58 90 followed by labor 29 19 electricity 5 42 etc for scps labor produces the most carbon emissions 56 59 followed by fertilizer 26 29 electricity 9 31 and gasoline combustion 4 93 and others in itps fertilizers 38 56 is the largest contributor to total carbon emissions flowed by pesticides 33 12 labor 15 88 and electricity 10 32 and others accordingly irps has the lowest carbon emissions which are mainly from labor 42 20 followed by fertilizers 31 86 diesel combustion 13 06 and electricity 11 28 in order in a word carbon emissions mainly come from the use of fertilizers and labor in kiwifruit cropping systems here carbon emissions per unit land are comparable to related studies such as 3 75 4 25 t co2 eq ha in italy rossi et al 2021 3 95 5 38 t co2 eq ha in new zealand müller et al 2015 as shown in fig 7 and the cei results show the same trend as the total carbon emissions per area with the highest carbon emission intensity appearing in sxps 0 16 followed by itps 0 15 and scps 0 12 and irps ranks the last 0 11 compared with irps cei value of sxps itps and scps rises by 45 45 36 36 and 9 09 respectively as two of main carbon emission sources fertilizers and labor should be paid more attention to in kiwifruit planting in the future especially for china here the presented indicator values are close to related research such as 0 13 0 16 kg co2 eq kg fruit in italy baudino et al 2017 meanwhile this study shows that in terms of carbon emission intensity the kiwifruit planting in italy has no advantages compared with iran and china and it also has the worst overall ranking among the major fruit production in this country cerutti et al 2013 4 4 emergy based indicators emergy indicator values of the four systems were exhibited in fig 8 in terms of the indicator uev irps had the highest resource efficiency 2 09e 11sej kg followed by scps 4 32e 11sej kg and sxps 7 49e 11sej kg and the resource efficiency of itps 8 10e 11sej kg is the lowest the highest resource efficiency of irps is mainly derived from its lowest total emergy input per unit of area in contrast the lowest kiwifruit yield per unit area adversely affects resource efficiency of itps for the indicator r irps performs the best with 12 14 followed by itps 9 00 and sxps 8 70 scps 6 84 has the worst resource structure because this system has much bigger share of economic input than the other three systems operation cost furthermore it is found that most of renewable input is derived from imported inputs especially for sxps and itps results of eyr reflect that scps had the highest economic benefit or competition ability 1 10 followed by irps 1 08 and itps 1 07 and sxps has the lowest economic benefit or competition ability 1 04 however the differences among the four kiwifruit planting systems only range between 2 88 5 77 relative to sxps generally they have low economic benefit due to high dependence on imported resources 91 for the elr indicator it follows trends of scps 13 65 sxps 10 48 itps 10 09 irps 7 26 and the differences among the four kiwifruit planting systems alter between 38 90 88 04 relative to irps therein scps has the highest environmental load mainly due to the highest share of purchased non renewable inputs in contrast irps has the lowest environmental load mainly due to its smallest share of purchased nonrenewable resources regarding the index esi the irps has the highest sustainability level 0 15 followed by itps 0 11 sxps 0 10 and scps ranks the last 0 08 mainly stemming from its highest environmental load however all the four systems are not sustainable in the long term mainly due to their high dependence on non renewable resources the results from the indicator pei illustrate that sxps has the largest pollutant emissions impact per unit product 2 54e 14 sej t followed by itps 1 58e 14 sej t and scps 8 29e 13 sej t and irps ranks the last 2 56e 13 sej t the differences among the other three kiwifruit planting systems range between 2 23 times 8 92 times relative to irps moreover it was found that total phosphorus discharge from the fertilizer used in the four systems is the main contributor to their pollutant emissions impact especially compound fertilizer for sxps according to the ratio of pei to uev it is found that pollutant emissions have the largest adverse impact on sxps followed by itps and scps and the irps ranks the last consequently low resource efficiency of agricultural materials especially chemical fertilizers not only raises economic cost of kiwifruit planting due to resources waste but also incurs adverse environmental impacts 4 5 cbi as shown in fig 9 the values of cbi follow trends of irps scps itps sxps cbi value of irps scps and itps is 21 70 times 3 32 times and 1 85 times that of sxps respectively so the synergy degree of irps is much larger than the other three systems which is derived from its highest sustainability level and its lowest pollutant emissions impact intensity in the four systems sxps has the lowest synergy degree 0 21 because it has the highest carbon emission intensity and the highest pollutant emissions impact intensity mainly rooting in the high share of chemical fertilizers the results of id table 8 show that in the irps pei contributes the largest to cbi followed by esi and cei regarding the scps the largest contribution to the cbi is pei followed by cei while esi has an obvious negative impact on the index value for the itps and sxps the largest negative impact on cbi comes from pei followed by cei and esi has slightly adverse impact on this index to strengthen the comprehensive performance improvement of the resource efficiency and resource structure should be further concerned for the scps itps and sxps should firstly emphasize its pollutant emission control and then carbon emission reduction generally irps has highest synergy degree among its emergy sustainability pollutant control and carbon emission reduction due to the lowest use of nonrenewable resources in terms of total amount and resource structure which shows the importance of improving the efficiency of agricultural materials use and resource structure and this system sets a good example for the other three planting systems for improving their comprehensive performance in the future 4 6 sensitivity analysis of emergy evaluation in the process of emergy evaluation the accuracy and representativeness of unit emergy values often affect the evaluation results in this study those uevs were cited from related databases and references however some uevs could not completely match different countries and regions which could bring some uncertainty to confirm the reliability of the study results this study implements sensitivity analysis through focusing on the impacts of main input categories on the emergy flows according to the structure of the emergy flows the top three emergy inputs in sxps scps and titps are operating cost compound fertilizer and organic fertilizer and the top three emergy inputs in irps are operating cost investment cost and nitrogen fertilizer this was done by assuming that the value of one of the three main inputs changing between 10 and 10 for each system and holding the other inputs constant and then comparing related indicator values with the baseline ones to observe their change scopes as shown in sm tables 8 11 increasing the emergy input of one of main items decreases the emergy yield ratio and enhances the environmental load rate thus weakens the emergy sustainability index in contrast decreasing the emergy input of one of main items raises the emergy yield ratio and reduces the environmental load rate thus enhances the emergy sustainability index however when the main items emergy inputs alter from 10 to 10 change rates of indicator values range between 7 33 7 33 4 62 5 27 4 22 4 22 and 4 99 5 63 respectively therefore changes of emergy inputs of main items have limited impacts on main emergy indicator values and thus the evaluation results can act as a reference for subsequent decision making 5 discussions and policy suggestions this study discovers that scps should properly enhance resource efficiency and improve resource structure and sxps and itps should pay special attention to environmental emissions to raise comprehensive performance of kiwifruit planting industry the following measures are presented for scps its resource structure of agricultural materials should be adjusted to raise its emergy sustainability the research results show that its low emergy sustainability level mainly roots in its high share of purchased non renewable input 87 16 mainly from operation cost 64 47 followed by compound fertilizer 17 63 furthermore 83 42 of the operation cost is derived from labor cost so it is necessary to reduce share of labor cost through raising mechanization level those agricultural machineries with low economic cost for precise fertilization irrigation and pesticide application are still lacking peng et al 2022 and related research and development should be promoted in the future in addition considering the lower share of organic fertilizers in the scps compared to the other systems shown in sm tables 4 7 raising share of organic fertilizers and or fym can also improve its resource structure and soil fertility and thus reduce the environmental load and enhance carbon sink mostashari rad et al 2020 and the following measures could be considered including 1 promoting the use of straw as fertilizer through improving the government led establishment of infrastructure related to straw collection storage and utilization ren et al 2019 and 2 extension of the application of livestock and poultry manure this measure not only can reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and improve the quality of soil but also mitigate environmental pollution from livestock and poultry breeding industry zhang et al 2021 related publicity efforts can be taken to promote the use of farmyard manure including raising farmers awareness through training field trips and distribution of pamphlets bagheri et al 2019 increasing temporary subsidies for growers who use manure formulating related integrated planning through combining kiwifruit planting with livestock breeding etc for sxps environmental emissions should be further reduced to raise their comprehensive performance the study illustrates that the factors hindering its synergy degree mainly come from pollutant emissions impacts followed by carbon emissions therein pollutant emissions impacts are mainly from total phosphorus discharged in water body and hu 2017 thought the fertilization amount of p fertilizer in this region could be reduced by about 96 through scientific fertilization methods carbon emissions of this system mainly derived from compound fertilizer 58 90 followed by labor 29 19 to reduce carbon emissions sxps should take following measures firstly its amount of organic fertilizers could be raised by about 2 times hu 2017 based on the existing level secondly local government departments should take active measures to guide kiwifruit growers to scientifically use fertilizers jia et al 2013 finally this system could mitigate carbon emissions from labor use through its raising mechanization level for itps it should also cut its environmental emissions for improving comprehensive performance the main factors affecting its synergy degree are rooted in pollutant emissions impacts followed by carbon emissions therein its pollutant emissions impacts mainly derive from total phosphorus discharged in water body and its carbon emissions are mainly caused by compound fertilizer and pesticides therefore besides controlling total phosphorus discharged and carbon emissions from compound fertilizer carbon emissions from pesticides should be emphasized in the future finally the kiwi planting industry still needs to further enhance its sustainability in the future although some differences exist among performance indicators of the four kiwi planting systems they are not sustainable in the long run due to great dependence on purchased non renewable inputs especially chemical fertilizers and labor cost and low utilization rate of fertilizers besides the abovementioned measures other measures could be also considered in the future these measures include developing special fertilizers for kiwifruit planting for raising utilization rate of fertilizers cultivation of new kiwifruit varieties for improving the economic benefit baudino et al 2017 intensive management for strengthening the comprehensive performance etc therein intensive management related measures include 1 enlarging scale of kiwi planting through merging those small scale orchards based on local related integrated planning of kiwifruit planting with livestock breeding 2 introduction of some advanced intelligent systems for insect prevention and control irrigation and fertilization etc and 3 developing a set of life cycle based integrated management software through considering resource and environmental as well as economic performances for optimizing the operation and management seidel sterzik et al 2018 soltanali et al 2017 6 conclusion this study compared the comprehensive performance of four kiwifruit planting systems in the three countries using the proposed integrated approach the main findings are summarized as follows 1 carbon emission intensity embodies trends of sxps 0 16 itps 0 15 scps 0 12 irps 0 11 for sxps and itps fertilizer is the largest contributor to carbon emissions however labor contributes the most to carbon emissions for scps and irps 2 sxps has the largest pollutant emissions impact per unit product 2 54e 14 sej t followed by itps 1 58e 14 sej t and scps 8 29e 13 sej t and irps ranks the last 2 56e 13 sej t which mainly comes from total phosphorus discharged into water body followed by nh3 emitted in the air 3 emergy sustainability reveals trends of irps itps sxps scps mainly due to different environmental load rates which depends on share of nonrenewable resources generally the four systems are not sustainable in the long term due to their high dependence on nonrenewable resources especially l s and chemical fertilizers 4 results of co benefit index reflect that irps has the best comprehensive performance due to its highest resource efficiency and reasonable resource structure followed by scps itps and sxps accordingly in summary improvement of utilization efficiency of chemical fertilizers and resource structure are urgent for kiwifruit planting the innovation of this study is to establish an integrated approach for comparing the comprehensive performance of kiwifruit planting systems by combining emergy sustainability index pollutant emissions impact and carbon emission intensity and it can also act as one of decision making tools for other crop production systems however emergy loss from solid wastes disposal and pollutant emissions impacts on biotic components have been neglected due to the lack of relevant basic data which could influence the study results to some degrees in addition although related suggestions proposed by this study can address corresponding issues discovered their comprehensive impacts on kiwifruit planting systems are not very clear all these issues still need further investigation in the future credit authorship contribution statement qiuwen

24152,as climate change unravels ecosystems are facing a warming of the climate and an increase in extreme heat events that are unprecedented in recent geological history we know very little of the ability of oceanic phytoplankton communities key players in the regulation of earth s climate by the oceans to adapt to these changes quantifying the resilience of phytoplankton communities to environmental stressors by means of adaptive evolution is however crucial to accurately predict the response of marine ecosystems to climate change in this work we use an eco evolutionary model to simulate the adaptive response of marine phytoplankton to temperature changes in an initially temperate oligotrophic water column by exploring a wide range of scenarios of phytoplankton adaptive capacity we find that phytoplankton can adapt to temperature increases even very large ones as long as they occur over the time scale of a century however when rapid and extreme events of temperature change are considered the phytoplankton adaptive capacity breaks down in a number of our scenarios in which primary productivity plummets as a result this suggests that current earth system models assuming perfect phytoplankton adaptatedness to temperature might be overestimating the phytoplankton s resilience to climate change keywords marine phytoplankton adaptation climate change resilience primary productivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction 1 1 phytoplankton adaptation and climate change the photosynthetic release of dioxygen and fixation of carbon and other essential elements n p fe si by marine microbial communities as they produce biomass is a core component of the biogeochemical machinery regulating the chemistry of the atmosphere and oceans thereby affecting the climate of our planet field et al 1998 henson et al 2011 in turn the oceanic environment nutrients availability temperature ph etc determines the functioning of phytoplankton communities as phytoplankton acclimates and evolutionarily adapts to the spatial and temporal variability of environmental conditions litchman et al 2012 as climate changes and will keep changing in the next hundreds of years phytoplankton will face one of the most rapid and diverse environmental shift in the history of our planet bopp et al 2013 combining global secular trends of ocean warming acidification stratification and desertification to ever more frequent extreme events e g burger et al 2022 gruber et al 2021 this raises the questions of the ability of marine phytoplankton to evolutionarily adapt to such changes and of the potential implications regarding the continued role of oceans in climate regulation the extent of the phytoplankton ability to adapt to environmental changes is currently unknown but expected to be substantial experimental and in situ observations irwin et al 2015 o donnell et al 2019 padfield et al 2016 tend to suggest that this process can operate in a matter of years a single liter of oceanic water in the euphotic zone contains 106 to 109 phytoplankton cells flombaum et al 2013 reproducing approximately once a day ward et al 2017 as the environment changes the large pool of phytoplankton individuals and their rapid generation time allow advantageous phenotypes either already present or rapidly appearing through mutations we here use this term in a broad sense to include any mechanisms generating intergenerational phenotypic diversity e g genetic mutations epigenetic recombination to take over communities through selective sweeps yet will adaptive processes be sufficiently rapid to mitigate the potential deleterious effect of climate change on phytoplankton communities given how arduous monitoring evolutionary processes in natural systems is and how little we know about the adaptive properties of the phytoplankton as a result it is for now difficult to answer this question with certainty and to infer how important phytoplankton adaptation to climate change is for the evolution of ocean biogeochemistry yet what we cannot measure in situ we can model in silico as a first step toward answering these questions we use an ocean model explicitly accounting for the adaptive evolution of the physiological properties of marine phytoplankton under climate change we explore a wide range of assumptions regarding the adaptive properties of phytoplankton communities and focus specifically on the adaptive response of the phytoplankton to temperature changes 1 2 phytoplankton and temperature the response of phytoplankton communities to temperature changes involves two main mechanisms eppley 1972 grimaud et al 2017 norberg 2004 fig 1 a and s1 at the scale of individual cells growth is typically maximized for a given temperature the optimal growth temperature t o p t above and below which growth drops to zero the drop being much swifter towards warmer temperatures see supplementary discussion the resulting thermal reaction norm represents the thermal niche of an individual phytoplankton cell or in other words the physiological ability of this individual to tolerate or acclimate to grimaud et al 2017 temperature changes every one of these thermal reaction norms can be placed under an increasing power law envelope this so called eppley envelope from the pioneering work of richard eppley 1972 thus describes the maximum growth rate achievable by any phytoplankton population given a specific temperature note that here we use the term population to designate a group of phytoplankton individuals having the same value of the trait t o p t in a phytoplankton community composed of several competing phytoplankton populations and in the absence of any other selection pressure one would expect that the phytoplankton population achieving maximal growth given the temperature of the local environment i e the population whose thermal reaction norm is equal for the temperature of the system to the eppley envelope fig 1a would outcompete the others in the long run the eppley envelope is therefore the optimal evolutionary response of a phytoplankton community to a temperature change norberg 2004 the eppley envelop is consequently often interpreted as the result of selection operating instantaneously on an infinite standing diversity perfect species sorting following lourens baas becking s motto everything is everywhere but the environment selects baas becking 1934 following litchman et al 2012 we define adaptation as natural selection operating on a phenotypically diverse community when the source of diversity is mutation as is ultimately always the case in biological systems it follows that the eppley envelop alternatively corresponds to the result of an instantaneous adaptive process of mutation selection i e perfect adaptation depending on the assumption made on whether phytoplankton communities can evolutionarily adapt or not to temperature changes the predicted change in phytoplankton growth in response to a temperature increase therefore switches from one extreme to the other fig 1b when assuming that phytoplankton communities can adapt perfectly and instantaneously to temperature fluctuations the growth rate is expected to increase exponentially with temperature henceforward we will call this scenario the darwinian demon scenario from law 1979 by contrast when assuming that phytoplankton communities cannot adapt the phytoplankton response to the temperature change relies solely on its physiology and the growth rate swiftly drops to 0 as temperature increases toward and beyond the tolerance threshold see supplementary discussion and supplementary table 1 we will call this second scenario the darwinian dummy scenario which of these two extreme and opposite scenarios is more realistic is expected to depend mostly on the time scale of the temperature change considered the physiological response of the phytoplankton spans over the lifetime of individuals few hours to few days ward et al 2017 evolutionary adaptation on the other hand is a multigenerational process that requires phytoplankton populations carrying newly adapted traits to progressively take over the community replacing through competitive exclusion older less adapted populations most global scale models of marine ecosystems assume that the temperature dependence of phytoplankton growth rate follows an eppley envelope regardless of the time scale of the temperature change considered e g anderson et al 2021 henson et al 2021 in other words and while it is often not interpreted as such e g henson et al 2021 state that in their models phytoplankton do not evolve or adapt to changing conditions those models de facto simulate a perfect thermal adaptation by phytoplankton communities is phytoplankton thermal adaptation close to being perfect in natural systems the relatively good match between the experimentally evaluated thermal norms of phytoplankton populations and in situ temperatures grimaud et al 2015 thomas et al 2012 constitutes indirect evidence of the ability of phytoplankton communities to adapt to some extent to temperature this does not provide however information on how rapidly adaptation occurs monitoring of shifts in the thermal niche of phytoplankton communities in situ and in laboratory experiments of artificial selection suggests that adaptation occurs over a few hundreds of generations one year to a few years depending on the taxa considered o donnell et al 2019 padfield et al 2016 still it remains unclear what the actual mechanisms involved in the observed shift in functional composition are e g does it rely on species sorting on a preexisting standing variation or on selection upon a de novo diversity generated through mutations collins et al 2014 litchman et al 2012 furthermore it is unclear whether general evolutionary properties of phytoplankton communities can be inferred from those observations although few ocean ecosystem models explicitly account for the thermal adaptation of the phytoplankton but see demory et al 2019 grimaud et al 2015 le gland et al 2021 ward et al 2021 see ward et al 2019 for a review of the approaches used to model evolution in ocean ecosystems none of them addresses the question of the evolutionary response of phytoplankton communities to changing temperatures and of the characteristic time scale of this process here we use an eco evolutionary model explicitly reproducing the functional shift in phytoplankton communities as a result of a mutation selection process to evaluate the phytoplankton response to long term secular trend of global warming and short term extreme events temperature changes we do so in the context of an initially temperate tropical water column exploring a wide range of assumptions regarding the adaptive capacity of the phytoplankton in order to address the lack of experimental constraints the goal is to ask depending on the assumptions of the evolutionary model how will phytoplankton activity change in response to temperature changes how reliant on evolutionary adaptation is that change how wrong are we when we assume perfect and instantaneous adaptation 2 methods 2 1 model we use the same setup of 1d model of water column as in le gland et al 2021 which resolves the vertical physics vertical mixing by turbulent diffusion of a temperate subtropical system similar to that of the bermudas durand et al 2001 saba et al 2010 this marine biogeochemical model resolves the dynamics of several plankton populations phytoplankton and zooplankton and of the concentration of dissolved and particulate forms of elements carbon nitrogen phosphorous iron essential to phytoplankton growth phytoplankton consumes these elements following a monod formulation monod 1949 and is itself consumed by zooplankton a recycling term then closes the ecosystem and the biomass lost to grazing or plankton death is recirculated in the system as dissolved and particulate organic elements see le gland et al 2021 for details the relevance of our model is that contrary to most ocean ecosystem models it simulates the variation of the functional composition of the phytoplankton community through time as the result of natural selection our approach is based on the spead model le gland et al 2021 itself adapted from the darwin model developed in follows et al 2007 that simulates adaptive evolution by means of trait diffusion instead of simulating the dynamics of a single phytoplankton population with fixed traits as most models do we simulate the dynamics of the abundance of 50 ecotypes p i each characterized by a specific thermal niche i e by a specific temperature of optimal growth t o p t i ranging from 18 to 50 34 c fig 1 both the empirically grounded parametrization of the thermal niche and the range of thermal optima explored are discussed in the supplementary materials each of these ecotypes grows and dies depending on the match of its thermal niche to the environmental temperature at each division event a mutation can occur so that the produced offspring ends up with a thermal niche different from that of its ancestor i e belongs to another ecotypes this process is driven by a key parameter of the model ν which is the probability of mutation per division or mutation rate see le gland et al 2021 merico et al 2014 smith et al 2016 and supplementary materials for further details this parameter determines the ability of the phytoplankton to generate functional diversity through mutation a necessary condition to darwinian evolution finally individuals are moved around within the water column through vertical mixing to summarize the functional composition of the phytoplankton community i e the biomass distribution amongst the 50 functional types varies as the combined result of three explicitly simulated mechanisms i mutations continuously introducing functional diversity in the community ii vertical mixing redistributing functional diversity throughout the column and iii competitive sorting selecting within the available functional diversity the ecotypes that are the most adapted to the local environmental conditions the first two mechanisms tend to increase phenotypic diversity in the community the third mechanism tends to drive it down note that our modeling approach typically results in trait distributions being characterized by very long tails i e many non viable ecotypes are unrealistically maintained in the system at infinitesimal levels by the mutational process to prevent this from happening we add an allee effect allee et al 1949 to our model below a certain biomass threshold chosen to affect only infinitesimally scarce ecotypes the biomass specific growth rate of phytoplankton ecotypes steeply decreases with biomass the main motivation for this strong assumption is therefore to counter an unrealistic feature of continuous population models their inability to model extinction see supplementary materials for more discussion and justification finally note that this type of approach is known to be sensitive to the number of functional types included when this number is too low sauterey et al 2017 we verified that it was not the case by doubling the number of types in the model 100 functional types with thermal optima still ranging from 18 to 50 34 c in some of our scenarios and obtained quantitatively equivalent results see the supplementary materials 2 2 steady state and regimes of climate change we study the predictions of the model in two types of environmental context first we consider the characteristics of the seasonal equilibrium of a temperate oligotrophic system similar to that of the bermudas the system alternates between two seasons a warm and nutrient depleted summer during which the water column is strongly stratified from april to october and a cold and nutrient rich winter during which the stratification of the water column breaks down from november to march fig 2 a and b second we evaluate the changes occurring to the system when it is subject to a regime shift due to climate change modeled as an increase of the average temperature and or of the amplitude of the seasonal temperature variation over 100 years the average temperature increases considered are 2 4 and 10 c applied uniformly over the water column while the amplitude of the seasonal variation in surface temperatures is increased from 8 c to 18 c these changes operate linearly over 100 years note that in order to artificially isolate the effect of regimes of temperature changes on the ecophysiology of the phytoplankton the changes in temperature do not feed back onto the physics and chemistry of the water column nutrient concentrations and the stratification profile of the water column remain the same as temperature changes while they would be expected to vary with temperature in an actual water column to assess whether such feedbacks could modify our predictions we evaluated the effect of a drop in nutrient supply due to thermal stratification by decreasing the total nutrient mass in the system in some of the scenarios described above see discussion and supplementary material 2 3 evolutionary scenarios we consider 5 evolutionary scenarios the first one is the darwinian demon scenario there is only one type of phytoplankton whose growth rate is always maximal i e follows the eppley envelope for any given temperature in other words the thermal trait t o p t of this darwinian demon is always equal to the evolutionary optimum noted t o p t that maximizes growth given the local temperature see supplementary materials and fig s1b on how we evaluate t o p t the second scenario is the darwinian dummy there is also only one population of phytoplankton but its thermal niche is now fixed to make it well adapted to the systems initial average surface temperature then in the three remaining scenarios we run the eco evolutionary spead model considering a high an intermediate and a low value of mutation rate ν 10 2 10 5 10 10 respectively in the absence of empirical constraints regarding what phytoplankton mutation rates are in natural systems those values have been chosen based on preliminary simulations to explore a range as wide as possible higher mutation rates become detrimental to phytoplankton mean reproduction rates and adaptive capacity as they result in too many suboptimal types being maintained in the community chen et al 2019 le gland et al 2021 on the other end of the spectrum lower mutation rates do not allow any diversity to be maintained as mutants are rapidly eliminated by the allee effect data not shown we initialize the simulation with a phytoplankton community composed of a single phytoplankton population characterized by the same thermal niche as the darwinian dummy in order for the mutational process to be the only source of the emergent functional diversity the coexistence of multiple ecotypes with different thermal niches in the phytoplankton community 2 4 functional composition and maladaptation at each depth z in the water column we use the biomass weighted average optimal growth temperature in the phytoplankton community t o p t z i t o p t z p i z i p i z as an indicator of the dominant trait in the community in the darwinian demon scenario t o p t z t o p t z with t o p t z varying in the water column following the environmental temperature t z see supplementary materials and fig s1b in the darwinian dummy scenario t o p t z always corresponds to prescribed and fixed t o p t of the phytoplankton community the absolute difference between t o p t z and the optimal value of the trait t o p t z of the darwinian demon i e the value of t o p t that maximizes growth given the temperature at z is then used to evaluate the maladaptation m z of the phytoplankton community to its environmental conditions with m z t o p t z t o p t z the unit of maladaptation is therefore the c thereafter we more specifically focus on the average trait and maladaptation of the phytoplankton at the surface t o p t 0 and m 0 respectively where most of the primary productivity pp occurs 3 results 3 1 eco evolutionary response of the phytoplankton to seasonal changes first we simulate the seasonal dynamics at equilibrium of our temperate tropical ecosystem in the five scenarios described above darwinian demon perfect and instantaneous adaptation darwinian dummy no adaptation and high intermediate and low mutation rates in the darwinian demon scenario biomass production is high during the late winter bloom and drops during the summer fig 2c and d the water column stratifies during the summer the nutrient supply to the surface drops and nutrients in the first 50 m are depleted by phytoplankton consumption fig 2b biomass production during the summer is then limited by the nutrient availability in the darwinian dummy scenario the dynamics of biomass production is similar except that the drop in productivity during the summer is much more pronounced fig 2c and d the biomass production in the darwinian dummy scenario is approximately 15 lower than in the darwininian demon scenario annually and up to 33 lower during the summer in that case the dip in production is not the result of a drop in nutrient availability as the nitrate concentration in the mixed layer increases as the summer progresses fig 2b instead it is due to surface temperature surpassing the fixed thermal tolerance of the darwinian dummy therefore restricted to deeper regions of the water column 50 m where cooler temperatures prevail throughout the year fig 2a and d in other words when the phytoplankton cannot adapt to temperature the thermal niche of the phytoplankton is in addition to nutrient availability a determining factor of biomass production this confinement of phytoplankton populations to their environmental thermal niche is called environmental filtering vallina et al 2017 as higher adaptive capacities of the phytoplankton are considered the phytoplankton is increasingly allowed near the surface and pp is increasingly high during the summer relative to the darwinian dummy fig 2c adaptation allowing the phytoplankton thermal niche to shift with environmental temperatures allows it to evade environmental filtering when the mutation rate of the phytoplankton is high ν 10 2 it adapts on the fly to seasonal changes in temperature fig 3 a near the surface the distribution of the trait t o p t in the community exhibits a single mode the high mutation rate allows for a rapid succession of events of mutation and selection resulting in a relatively good match between community averaged t o p t and the environmental temperature to which it is exposed fig 3d and e this fast paced evolution allows a rapid recovery of pp after the initial dip as the summer progresses fig 2c when the phytoplankton mutation rate is lower ν 10 5 and 10 10 the underlying mechanism to thermal adaptation is fundamentally different as it relies on successive shifts in relative abundance of ecotypes coexisting throughout the year each being adapted to specific depths and periods of the year fig 3b and c in other words the community averaged t o p t mostly changes by competitive selection of the most adapted of a pool of pre existing ecotypes rather than by the selection of new ecotypes appearing through trait mutation in these scenarios ecological selection thereby operates on a standing diversity that builds up over the years and is maintained by the spatio temporal variability of the thermal conditions in the water column this result therefore illustrates how the dichotomy between species sorting and adaptation is sometimes artificial given how closely interwoven the standing diversity on which species sorting applies and the mutational process which fuels adaptation are the lower the mutation rate is the lower is the extent of the emerging standing diversity i e of the variance of t o p t in the community on which selection can apply and the higher is the mismatch between the average thermal niche of the phytoplankton and the temperature fig 3d and e when the phytoplankton mutation rate is the lowest ν 10 10 the range of the thermal adaptation becomes so narrow that there is almost no seasonal variability in the community averaged t o p t the phytoplankton community cannot therefore adapt to the warm temperature of the summer nor to the cold temperature of the winter the almost constant community averaged t o p t corresponds to the annual average of the environmental temperature as a result pp throughout the year is very close to that of the darwinian dummy scenario fig 2c yet this average jack of all trades t o p t remains the best strategy possible given the limited adaptive capacity of the phytoplankton allowing phytoplankton to survive the warm and cold extremes of the year to sum up these results highlight that the capacity of the phytoplankton to adapt to seasonal changes in temperature can significantly influence its annual productivity 15 difference in annual pp between perfect and no adaptation as thermal adaptation promotes the capacity of the phytoplankton to consume nutrients in the mixed layer of the water column throughout the year depending on the intensity of the mutational process adaptation can rely either on a de novo diversity produced and selected upon as temperature changes or on a standing diversity emerging and maintained over the years how will phytoplankton productivity change under those various eco evolutionary regimes in a context of climate change 3 2 eco evolutionary response to global climate changes climate change is expected to manifest itself both through a secular trend of temperature increase and through more frequent extreme temperature events burger et al 2022 frölicher et al 2018 gruber et al 2021 oliver et al 2019 2018 to simulate these two phenomena independently and combined we change the temperature of the water column by i imposing a temperature increase without an increase in seasonal amplitude ii imposing an increase in seasonal amplitude without changing the average temperature and iii imposing simultaneously an increase in average temperatures and in seasonal amplitude see methods fig 4 a c we look at the resulting changes in the annually averaged pp and in the annually averaged community averaged t o p t and maladaptation of the phytoplankton community we first consider the consequences of temperature warming up over 100 years without changes in seasonal amplitude in the darwinian dummy scenario pp after 100 years is systematically lower than its initial value and the phytoplankton community actually collapses when the long term temperature increase is the strongest 10 c fig 4d as the average temperature increases the phytoplankton community with a fixed non adaptive thermal niche becomes increasingly unfit to near surface environmental conditions fig 4e during summer environmental filtering results in phytoplankton being progressively confined to deeper regions of the water column for longer periods of time the phytoplankton eventually dies out when the resulting biomass loss becomes too large to be balanced out by biomass production during the winter bloom by contrast when phytoplankton individuals are darwinian demons a temperature increase results in an increase in pp the extent of this boost in primary productivity is positively and linearly correlated to the amplitude of the temperature increase 11 23 and 66 in pp for 2 4 and 10 c respectively fig 4d according to the eppley envelope the metabolic activity of the phytoplankton accelerates with temperature as temperature increases and because phytoplankton are able to adapt immediately and perfectly to it its ability to produce biomass for a given nutrient influx increases but see the discussion section note that in line with previous work archibald et al 2022 biomass counter intuitively decreases as pp increases see supplementary figure 4 similarly to archibald et al 2022 we interpret this dual pattern as an acceleration of the biomass turnover faster transfer to zooplankton then remineralization when explicitly including adaptive evolution of phytoplankton in the model the predicted changes in biomass and pp are very similar despite the large differences in the assumed mutation rates fig 4d as long as the mutational process is sufficient to sustain some degree of functional diversity thermal adaptation can proceed it would therefore appear that the darwinian demon assumption is a robust approximation of the adaptive capacity of phytoplankton communities in other words thermal adaptation is very likely to be sufficiently rapid to keep up with global warming even for a temperature increase as large as 10 c over 100 years in fact maladaptation remains constant over time at the surface in most scenarios and even drops when the mutation rate is high fig 4e this latter observation stems from the fact that phytoplankton individuals divide faster as temperature increases generating more mutants and the phytoplankton community is able to adapt faster to seasonal changes as a result this is particularly true when thermal adaptation mostly relies on de novo diversity such as in the high mutation rate scenario fig 3a we then consider the effect of seasonal amplification with no change in the annually averaged temperature 0 c in the seasonal amplification case in fig 4 we observe that pp drops in every evolutionary scenarios from 8 in the darwinian demon scenario to 42 in the darwinian dummy scenario the other scenarios fall between these two extreme cases fig 4d the increased seasonality implies colder temperatures during the winter and warmer temperatures during the summer as temperatures prevailing during the winter bloom get colder fig 4a c the phytoplankton metabolism slows down fig 1 and productivity lowers accordingly this explains the productivity drop in the darwinian demon scenario in spite of adaptation being perfect fig 4d additionally when adaptation is imperfect the phytoplankton community progressively becomes unable to adapt to the increasingly large seasonal variation in temperature this increased maladaptation drives productivity down 22 28 and 31 for high intermediate and low mutation rates respectively fig 5 b therefore contrary to the previous case the model predicts that mutation rate is a key parameter when increasing the seasonal amplitude without changing the average temperature fig 4d to summarize pp increases with average temperature except in the darwinian dummy scenario but decreases with amplified seasonality when increasing temperatures and seasonality simultaneously in the darwinian demon scenario the negative effect of the seasonal amplification on pp is largely marginal compared to the positive effect of the average temperature increase 3 14 and 57 for 2 4 and 10 c respectively fig 4d however this is not necessarily the case when adaptation is imperfect the positive effect of a 10 c warming balances out the negative effect of seasonal amplification and leads to pp increasing by 41 when the mutation rate is high by 8 when it is intermediate and by 0 2 when the mutation rate is low fig 4e the phytoplankton still goes to extinction in the darwinian dummy scenario however for a 4 c warming the negative effect of seasonal amplification dominates and pp drops down 0 8 15 and 20 for high intermediate and low mutation rates fig 4e overall we find that primary productivity is expected to increase as global temperatures rise up in the context of a regime of climate change as long as phytoplankton communities are characterized by some capacity to adapt to temperature changes fig 4d and 5 this effect could nevertheless be mitigated by an increase in thermal maladaptation fig 4d e and 5 thermal maladaptation is expected to increase as short term variations of temperature become larger and faster fig 5 the extent of this increased maladaptation then depends on the adaptive capacity of phytoplankton communities determined by their characteristic mutation rate fig 4e the predictions of our model are therefore especially sensitive to the adaptive capacity of the phytoplankton when increased seasonality is considered fig 4d as a result our model predicts anything from a 31 to a 69 change in primary productivity depending on the assumed nature and amplitude of global warming change in temperature seasonality and extent of the phytoplankton adaptive capacity fig 4d and 5 4 discussion using a 1d ocean model we simulated the eco evolutionary response of a phytoplankton community to long term and short term temperature changes exploring a wide range of scenarios regarding the evolutionary properties of the phytoplankton from perfect adaptation to no adaptation at all and the regime of temperature changes we found that when climate change is considered solely as a long term trend of temperature increase the adaptive response of phytoplankton is in most cases sufficiently rapid for phytoplankton to persist and even to see its biomass production increase including for very large temperature increases e g 10 c over 100 years fig 4a the commonly used darwinian demon approximation then emerges as an acceptable representation of the adaptive capacity of the phytoplankton however when the amplitude of the seasonal variability of temperatures increases with the average temperatures which is likely to occur in a regime of climate change frölicher et al 2018 gruber et al 2021 oliver et al 2019 2018 the darwinian demon approximation is no longer valid we find that the efficacy of phytoplankton adaptation to increasingly extreme short term temperature changes is indeed very dependent on the assumed phytoplankton mutation rate the resulting maladaptation can substantially mitigate the prediction of increased biomass production in some cases when the amplitude of those short term events is large compared to that of the long term temperature increase biomass production actually drops down as climate changes fig 5 as primary production is one of the main driving forces of ocean biogeochemistry our study highlights the importance of phytoplankton adaptation for the resilience of marine ecosystems to climate change our results are however obtained in an idealized framework isolating the response of a local phytoplankton community to temperature changes alone several components of climate change and of the phytoplankton s response to it are therefore neglected first adaptation in the ocean is not a purely local process when traits are locally selected they can then be exported elsewhere through oceanic circulation and influence positively or not the phytoplankton adaptive response across the ocean leibold and norberg 2004 loeuille and leibold 2008 sauterey et al 2017 similarly climate change will not just affect temperatures but a multitude of other characteristics of oceanic systems nutrient availability ph water stratification horizontal circulation over long time scales i e the century but also through extreme compound events burger et al 2022 gruber et al 2021 we chose to evaluate in isolation the effect of temperature on the evolution of thermal niches and ignored those additional environmental stresses for simplicity however in natural systems under climate change these environmental stresses could affect phytoplankton growth and adaptive capacity brennan et al 2017 for instance climate change is expected to enhance thermal stratification which should lead to a decreased nutrient supply to the euphotic zone especially during summer climate change is also expected to increase depth of the mixed layer and the frequency and intensity of storms which both tend to increase nutrient supplies by vertical turbulence sallée et al 2021 predicting how nutrient limitation will evolve under climate change is therefore challenging moreover predicting the combined effect of nutrient limitations and temperature changes on phytoplankton growth and on the capacity of phytoplankton to adapt is a non trivial issue empirical evidence suggests for instance that the effect of temperature changes on phytoplankton growth could be largely nullified in nutrient depleted conditions marañón et al 2018 although those questions are beyond the scope of this study we provide some back of the envelope estimates and additional discussion of how changes in nutrient supply affect our results see supplementary material although the predicted increase in pp can be reversed by a concomitant decrease in nutrient supply the main results regarding the sensitivity of pp evolution to the phytoplankton adaptive capacity are qualitatively unaffected those additional simulations actually show that the capacity of phytoplankton to adapt to temperature changes is diminished under more nutrient limited conditions see supplementary discussion this suggests that such interacting effects between multiple environmental stressors might play a key role in determining the efficacy of phytoplankton adaptation across oceans e g in nutrient depleted vs nutrient rich regions and illustrates the need for further investigations to explore these questions we plan moving forward to implement our approach in a 3d model of ocean circulation such an integrated approach will allow evaluating in a spatially accurate environmental context how dispersal the spatial distribution of environmental stressors and their covariance across oceans affect phytoplankton adaptation and how this is expected to change in the context of climate change additionally several functional traits of phytoplankton communities are expected to evolve simultaneously in response to the combined selective pressures resulting from climate change e g cell size traits related to nutrient ph or light stresses this raises an intriguing question how does the simultaneous evolution of multiple traits influence the evolution of each singular trait see boyd et al 2018 and brennan et al 2017 for some empirically grounded elements of response and savage et al 2007 for a first attempt at modeling multiple traits evolution in phytoplankton similarly phytoplankton are not the only marine organisms that climate change will affect higher trophic levels characterized by a slower demography hence by a slower pace of evolutionary response will also be impacted by it the same goes for the recycling microbial loop that determines how much of the organic matter circulating into marine ecosystems is recycled toward the ocean surface and how much is exported to the deep ocean cherabier and ferrière 2022 extending our approach to simulate the simultaneous evolution of multiple traits as done in le gland et al 2021 and the adaptive evolution of populations other than phytoplankton would provide an ideal modeling framework to address those currently unresolved issues finally as our results suggest that the adaptive capacity of phytoplankton might be a determining factor of the resilience of marine ecosystems to climate change while our quantitative knowledge of what that capacity actually is remains very limited we argue that quantitative assessments of phytoplankton adaptive properties becomes an urgent matter although experimental work in laboratory remains a viable option we argue that combining global oceans models including phytoplankton evolution with observational data might constitute a complementary and promising avenue of research many macro scale phenomena such as the emergence of the global biogeography of the thermal niches of the phytoplankton or the response of the phytoplankton to rapid climatic events such as el niño la niña most likely involve to some extent thermal adaptation by the phytoplankton ocean wide meta genomic data sets e g chaffron et al 2021 sunagawa et al 2020 and satellite observations mouw et al 2019 are now becoming increasingly available and can be used to infer marine ecosystems composition and function in such macro scale contexts we argue that constraining the parametrization of evolutionary approaches such as ours integrated in 3d models of ocean circulation based on the ability of these coupled models to reproduce those observed global scale phenomena will constitute an efficient way to quantify the adaptive properties of marine ecosystems 5 concluding remarks our findings suggest that the resilience of marine ecosystems to climate change and more specifically to the multiplication of extreme climatic events will be determined by the ability of phytoplankton communities to adapt current earth system models implicitly assume that phytoplankton communities are perfectly adapted to their thermal environment at any time and are therefore likely to overestimate marine ecosystems resilience while the present exploratory work shows how our limited quantitative knowledge of phytoplankton adaptive properties limits our ability to predict the resilience of marine ecosystems to climate change it also paves the way toward improving that knowledge through the use of models of phytoplankton evolution ultimately we think that approaches such as ours may play a key

24152,as climate change unravels ecosystems are facing a warming of the climate and an increase in extreme heat events that are unprecedented in recent geological history we know very little of the ability of oceanic phytoplankton communities key players in the regulation of earth s climate by the oceans to adapt to these changes quantifying the resilience of phytoplankton communities to environmental stressors by means of adaptive evolution is however crucial to accurately predict the response of marine ecosystems to climate change in this work we use an eco evolutionary model to simulate the adaptive response of marine phytoplankton to temperature changes in an initially temperate oligotrophic water column by exploring a wide range of scenarios of phytoplankton adaptive capacity we find that phytoplankton can adapt to temperature increases even very large ones as long as they occur over the time scale of a century however when rapid and extreme events of temperature change are considered the phytoplankton adaptive capacity breaks down in a number of our scenarios in which primary productivity plummets as a result this suggests that current earth system models assuming perfect phytoplankton adaptatedness to temperature might be overestimating the phytoplankton s resilience to climate change keywords marine phytoplankton adaptation climate change resilience

evolutionary processes in natural systems is and how little we know about the adaptive properties of the phytoplankton as a result it is for now difficult to answer this question with certainty and to infer how important phytoplankton adaptation to climate change is for the evolution of ocean biogeochemistry yet what we cannot measure in situ we can model in silico as a first step toward answering these questions we use an ocean model explicitly accounting for the adaptive evolution of the physiological properties of marine phytoplankton under climate change we explore a wide range of assumptions regarding the adaptive properties of phytoplankton communities and focus specifically on the adaptive response of the phytoplankton to temperature changes 1 2 phytoplankton and temperature the response of phytoplankton communities to temperature changes involves two main mechanisms eppley 1972 grimaud et al 2017 norberg 2004 fig 1 a and s1 at the scale of individual cells growth is typically maximized for a given temperature the optimal growth temperature t o p t above and below which growth drops to zero the drop being much swifter towards warmer temperatures see supplementary discussion the resulting thermal reaction norm represents the thermal niche of an individual phytoplankton cell or in other words the physiological ability of this individual to tolerate or acclimate to grimaud et al 2017 temperature changes every one of these thermal reaction norms can be placed under an increasing power law envelope this so called eppley envelope from the pioneering work of richard eppley 1972 thus describes the maximum growth rate achievable by any phytoplankton population given a specific temperature note that here we use the term population to designate a group of phytoplankton individuals having the same value of the trait t o p t in a phytoplankton community composed of several competing phytoplankton populations and in the absence of any other selection pressure one would expect that the phytoplankton population achieving maximal growth given the temperature of the local environment i e the population whose thermal reaction norm is equal for the temperature of the system to the eppley envelope fig 1a would outcompete the others in the long run the eppley envelope is therefore the optimal evolutionary response of a phytoplankton community to a temperature change norberg 2004 the eppley envelop is consequently often interpreted as the result of selection operating instantaneously on an infinite standing diversity perfect species sorting following lourens baas becking s motto everything is everywhere but the environment selects baas becking 1934 following litchman et al 2012 we define adaptation as natural selection operating on a phenotypically diverse community when the source of diversity is mutation as is ultimately always the case in biological systems it follows that the eppley envelop alternatively corresponds to the result of an instantaneous adaptive process of mutation selection i e perfect adaptation depending on the assumption made on whether phytoplankton communities can evolutionarily adapt or not to temperature changes the predicted change in phytoplankton growth in response to a temperature increase therefore switches from one extreme to the other fig 1b when assuming that phytoplankton communities can adapt perfectly and instantaneously to temperature fluctuations the growth rate is expected to increase exponentially with temperature henceforward we will call this scenario the darwinian demon scenario from law 1979 by contrast when assuming that phytoplankton communities cannot adapt the phytoplankton response to the temperature change relies solely on its physiology and the growth rate swiftly drops to 0 as temperature increases toward and beyond the tolerance threshold see supplementary discussion and supplementary table 1 we will call this second scenario the darwinian dummy scenario which of these two extreme and opposite scenarios is more realistic is expected to depend mostly on the time scale of the temperature change considered the physiological response of the phytoplankton spans over the lifetime of individuals few hours to few days ward et al 2017 evolutionary adaptation on the other hand is a multigenerational process that requires phytoplankton populations carrying newly adapted traits to progressively take over the community replacing through competitive exclusion older less adapted populations most global scale models of marine ecosystems assume that the temperature dependence of phytoplankton growth rate follows an eppley envelope regardless of the time scale of the temperature change considered e g anderson et al 2021 henson et al 2021 in other words and while it is often not interpreted as such e g henson et al 2021 state that in their models phytoplankton do not evolve or adapt to changing conditions those models de facto simulate a perfect thermal adaptation by phytoplankton communities is phytoplankton thermal adaptation close to being perfect in natural systems the relatively good match between the experimentally evaluated thermal norms of phytoplankton populations and in situ temperatures grimaud et al 2015 thomas et al 2012 constitutes indirect evidence of the ability of phytoplankton communities to adapt to some extent to temperature this does not provide however information on how rapidly adaptation occurs monitoring of shifts in the thermal niche of phytoplankton communities in situ and in laboratory experiments of artificial selection suggests that adaptation occurs over a few hundreds of generations one year to a few years depending on the taxa considered o donnell et al 2019 padfield et al 2016 still it remains unclear what the actual mechanisms involved in the observed shift in functional composition are e g does it rely on species sorting on a preexisting standing variation or on selection upon a de novo diversity generated through mutations collins et al 2014 litchman et al 2012 furthermore it is unclear whether general evolutionary properties of phytoplankton communities can be inferred from those observations although few ocean ecosystem models explicitly account for the thermal adaptation of the phytoplankton but see demory et al 2019 grimaud et al 2015 le gland et al 2021 ward et al 2021 see ward et al 2019 for a review of the approaches used to model evolution in ocean ecosystems none of them addresses the question of the evolutionary response of phytoplankton communities to changing temperatures and of the characteristic time scale of this process here we use an eco evolutionary model explicitly reproducing the functional shift in phytoplankton communities as a result of a mutation selection process to evaluate the phytoplankton response to long term secular trend of global warming and short term extreme events temperature changes we do so in the context of an initially temperate tropical water column exploring a wide range of assumptions regarding the adaptive capacity of the phytoplankton in order to address the lack of experimental constraints the goal is to ask depending on the assumptions of the evolutionary model how will phytoplankton activity change in response to temperature changes how reliant on evolutionary adaptation is that change how wrong are we when we assume perfect and instantaneous adaptation 2 methods 2 1 model we use the same setup of 1d model of water column as in le gland et al 2021 which resolves the vertical physics vertical mixing by turbulent diffusion of a temperate subtropical system similar to that of the bermudas durand et al 2001 saba et al 2010 this marine biogeochemical model resolves the dynamics of several plankton populations phytoplankton and zooplankton and of the concentration of dissolved and particulate forms of elements carbon nitrogen phosphorous iron essential to phytoplankton growth phytoplankton consumes these elements following a monod formulation monod 1949 and is itself consumed by zooplankton a recycling term then closes the ecosystem and the biomass lost to grazing or plankton death is recirculated in the system as dissolved and particulate organic elements see le gland et al 2021 for details the relevance of our model is that contrary to most ocean ecosystem models it simulates the variation of the functional composition of the phytoplankton community through time as the result of natural selection our approach is based on the spead model le gland et al 2021 itself adapted from the darwin model developed in follows et al 2007 that simulates adaptive evolution by means of trait diffusion instead of simulating the dynamics of a single phytoplankton population with fixed traits as most models do we simulate the dynamics of the abundance of 50 ecotypes p i each characterized by a specific thermal niche i e by a specific temperature of optimal growth t o p t i ranging from 18 to 50 34 c fig 1 both the empirically grounded parametrization of the thermal niche and the range of thermal optima explored are discussed in the supplementary materials each of these ecotypes grows and dies depending on the match of its thermal niche to the environmental temperature at each division event a mutation can occur so that the produced offspring ends up with a thermal niche different from that of its ancestor i e belongs to another ecotypes this process is driven by a key parameter of the model ν which is the probability of mutation per division or mutation rate see le gland et al 2021 merico et al 2014 smith et al 2016 and supplementary materials for further details this parameter determines the ability of the phytoplankton to generate functional diversity through mutation a necessary condition to darwinian evolution finally individuals are moved around within the water column through vertical mixing to summarize the functional composition of the phytoplankton community i e the biomass distribution amongst the 50 functional types varies as the combined result of three explicitly simulated mechanisms i mutations continuously introducing functional diversity in the community ii vertical mixing redistributing functional diversity throughout the column and iii competitive sorting selecting within the available functional diversity the ecotypes that are the most adapted to the local environmental conditions the first two mechanisms tend to increase phenotypic diversity in the community the third mechanism tends to drive it down note that our modeling approach typically results in trait distributions being characterized by very long tails i e many non viable ecotypes are unrealistically maintained in the system at infinitesimal levels by the mutational process to prevent this from happening we add an allee effect allee et al 1949 to our model below a certain biomass threshold chosen to affect only infinitesimally scarce ecotypes the biomass specific growth rate of phytoplankton ecotypes steeply decreases with biomass the main motivation for this strong assumption is therefore to counter an unrealistic feature of continuous population models their inability to model extinction see supplementary materials for more discussion and justification finally note that this type of approach is known to be sensitive to the number of functional types included when this number is too low sauterey et al 2017 we verified that it was not the case by doubling the number of types in the model 100 functional types with thermal optima still ranging from 18 to 50 34 c in some of our scenarios and obtained quantitatively equivalent results see the supplementary materials 2 2 steady state and regimes of climate change we study the predictions of the model in two types of environmental context first we consider the characteristics of the seasonal equilibrium of a temperate oligotrophic system similar to that of the bermudas the system alternates between two seasons a warm and nutrient depleted summer during which the water column is strongly stratified from april to october and a cold and nutrient rich winter during which the stratification of the water column breaks down from november to march fig 2 a and b second we evaluate the changes occurring to the system when it is subject to a regime shift due to climate change modeled as an increase of the average temperature and or of the amplitude of the seasonal temperature variation over 100 years the average temperature increases considered are 2 4 and 10 c applied uniformly over the water column while the amplitude of the seasonal variation in surface temperatures is increased from 8 c to 18 c these changes operate linearly over 100 years note that in order to artificially isolate the effect of regimes of temperature changes on the ecophysiology of the phytoplankton the changes in temperature do not feed back onto the physics and chemistry of the water column nutrient concentrations and the stratification profile of the water column remain the same as temperature changes while they would be expected to vary with temperature in an actual water column to assess whether such feedbacks could modify our predictions we evaluated the effect of a drop in nutrient supply due to thermal stratification by decreasing the total nutrient mass in the system in some of the scenarios described above see discussion and supplementary material 2 3 evolutionary scenarios we consider 5 evolutionary scenarios the first one is the darwinian demon scenario there is only one type of phytoplankton whose growth rate is always maximal i e follows the eppley envelope for any given temperature in other words the thermal trait t o p t of this darwinian demon is always equal to the evolutionary optimum noted t o p t that maximizes growth given the local temperature see supplementary materials and fig s1b on how we evaluate t o p t the second scenario is the darwinian dummy there is also only one population of phytoplankton but its thermal niche is now fixed to make it well adapted to the systems initial average surface temperature then in the three remaining scenarios we run the eco evolutionary spead model considering a high an intermediate and a low value of mutation rate ν 10 2 10 5 10 10 respectively in the absence of empirical constraints regarding what phytoplankton mutation rates are in natural systems those values have been chosen based on preliminary simulations to explore a range as wide as possible higher mutation rates become detrimental to phytoplankton mean reproduction rates and adaptive capacity as they result in too many suboptimal types being maintained in the community chen et al 2019 le gland et al 2021 on the other end of the spectrum lower mutation rates do not allow any diversity to be maintained as mutants are rapidly eliminated by the allee effect data not shown we initialize the simulation with a phytoplankton community composed of a single phytoplankton population characterized by the same thermal niche as the darwinian dummy in order for the mutational process to be the only source of the emergent functional diversity the coexistence of multiple ecotypes with different thermal niches in the phytoplankton community 2 4 functional composition and maladaptation at each depth z in the water column we use the biomass weighted average optimal growth temperature in the phytoplankton community t o p t z i t o p t z p i z i p i z as an indicator of the dominant trait in the community in the darwinian demon scenario t o p t z t o p t z with t o p t z varying in the water column following the environmental temperature t z see supplementary materials and fig s1b in the darwinian dummy scenario t o p t z always corresponds to prescribed and fixed t o p t of the phytoplankton community the absolute difference between t o p t z and the optimal value of the trait t o p t z of the darwinian demon i e the value of t o p t that maximizes growth given the temperature at z is then used to evaluate the maladaptation m z of the phytoplankton community to its environmental conditions with m z t o p t z t o p t z the unit of maladaptation is therefore the c thereafter we more specifically focus on the average trait and maladaptation of the phytoplankton at the surface t o p t 0 and m 0 respectively where most of the primary productivity pp occurs 3 results 3 1 eco evolutionary response of the phytoplankton to seasonal changes first we simulate the seasonal dynamics at equilibrium of our temperate tropical ecosystem in the five scenarios described above darwinian demon perfect and instantaneous adaptation darwinian dummy no adaptation and high intermediate and low mutation rates in the darwinian demon scenario biomass production is high during the late winter bloom and drops during the summer fig 2c and d the water column stratifies during the summer the nutrient supply to the surface drops and nutrients in the first 50 m are depleted by phytoplankton consumption fig 2b biomass production during the summer is then limited by the nutrient availability in the darwinian dummy scenario the dynamics of biomass production is similar except that the drop in productivity during the summer is much more pronounced fig 2c and d the biomass production in the darwinian dummy scenario is approximately 15 lower than in the darwininian demon scenario annually and up to 33 lower during the summer in that case the dip in production is not the result of a drop in nutrient availability as the nitrate concentration in the mixed layer increases as the summer progresses fig 2b instead it is due to surface temperature surpassing the fixed thermal tolerance of the darwinian dummy therefore restricted to deeper regions of the water column 50 m where cooler temperatures prevail throughout the year fig 2a and d in other words when the phytoplankton cannot adapt to temperature the thermal niche of the phytoplankton is in addition to nutrient availability a determining factor of biomass production this confinement of phytoplankton populations to their environmental thermal niche is called environmental filtering vallina et al 2017 as higher adaptive capacities of the phytoplankton are considered the phytoplankton is increasingly allowed near the surface and pp is increasingly high during the summer relative to the darwinian dummy fig 2c adaptation allowing the phytoplankton thermal niche to shift with environmental temperatures allows it to evade environmental filtering when the mutation rate of the phytoplankton is high ν 10 2 it adapts on the fly to seasonal changes in temperature fig 3 a near the surface the distribution of the trait t o p t in the community exhibits a single mode the high mutation rate allows for a rapid succession of events of mutation and selection resulting in a relatively good match between community averaged t o p t and the environmental temperature to which it is exposed fig 3d and e this fast paced evolution allows a rapid recovery of pp after the initial dip as the summer progresses fig 2c when the phytoplankton mutation rate is lower ν 10 5 and 10 10 the underlying mechanism to thermal adaptation is fundamentally different as it relies on successive shifts in relative abundance of ecotypes coexisting throughout the year each being adapted to specific depths and periods of the year fig 3b and c in other words the community averaged t o p t mostly changes by competitive selection of the most adapted of a pool of pre existing ecotypes rather than by the selection of new ecotypes appearing through trait mutation in these scenarios ecological selection thereby operates on a standing diversity that builds up over the years and is maintained by the spatio temporal variability of the thermal conditions in the water column this result therefore illustrates how the dichotomy between species sorting and adaptation is sometimes artificial given how closely interwoven the standing diversity on which species sorting applies and the mutational process which fuels adaptation are the lower the mutation rate is the lower is the extent of the emerging standing diversity i e of the variance of t o p t in the community on which selection can apply and the higher is the mismatch between the average thermal niche of the phytoplankton and the temperature fig 3d and e when the phytoplankton mutation rate is the lowest ν 10 10 the range of the thermal adaptation becomes so narrow that there is almost no seasonal variability in the community averaged t o p t the phytoplankton community cannot therefore adapt to the warm temperature of the summer nor to the cold temperature of the winter the almost constant community averaged t o p t corresponds to the annual average of the environmental temperature as a result pp throughout the year is very close to that of the darwinian dummy scenario fig 2c yet this average jack of all trades t o p t remains the best strategy possible given the limited adaptive capacity of the phytoplankton allowing phytoplankton to survive the warm and cold extremes of the year to sum up these results highlight that the capacity of the phytoplankton to adapt to seasonal changes in temperature can significantly influence its annual productivity 15 difference in annual pp between perfect and no adaptation as thermal adaptation promotes the capacity of the phytoplankton to consume nutrients in the mixed layer of the water column throughout the year depending on the intensity of the mutational process adaptation can rely either on a de novo diversity produced and selected upon as temperature changes or on a standing diversity emerging and maintained over the years how will phytoplankton productivity change under those various eco evolutionary regimes in a context of climate change 3 2 eco evolutionary response to global climate changes climate change is expected to manifest itself both through a secular trend of temperature increase and through more frequent extreme temperature events burger et al 2022 frölicher et al 2018 gruber et al 2021 oliver et al 2019 2018 to simulate these two phenomena independently and combined we change the temperature of the water column by i imposing a temperature increase without an increase in seasonal amplitude ii imposing an increase in seasonal amplitude without changing the average temperature and iii imposing simultaneously an increase in average temperatures and in seasonal amplitude see methods fig 4 a c we look at the resulting changes in the annually averaged pp and in the annually averaged community averaged t o p t and maladaptation of the phytoplankton community we first consider the consequences of temperature warming up over 100 years without changes in seasonal amplitude in the darwinian dummy scenario pp after 100 years is systematically lower than its initial value and the phytoplankton community actually collapses when the long term temperature increase is the strongest 10 c fig 4d as the average temperature increases the phytoplankton community with a fixed non adaptive thermal niche becomes increasingly unfit to near surface environmental conditions fig 4e during summer environmental filtering results in phytoplankton being progressively confined to deeper regions of the water column for longer periods of time the phytoplankton eventually dies out when the resulting biomass loss becomes too large to be balanced out by biomass production during the winter bloom by contrast when phytoplankton individuals are darwinian demons a temperature increase results in an increase in pp the extent of this boost in primary productivity is positively and linearly correlated to the amplitude of the temperature increase 11 23 and 66 in pp for 2 4 and 10 c respectively fig 4d according to the eppley envelope the metabolic activity of the phytoplankton accelerates with temperature as temperature increases and because phytoplankton are able to adapt immediately and perfectly to it its ability to produce biomass for a given nutrient influx increases but see the discussion section note that in line with previous work archibald et al 2022 biomass counter intuitively decreases as pp increases see supplementary figure 4 similarly to archibald et al 2022 we interpret this dual pattern as an acceleration of the biomass turnover faster transfer to zooplankton then remineralization when explicitly including adaptive evolution of phytoplankton in the model the predicted changes in biomass and pp are very similar despite the large differences in the assumed mutation rates fig 4d as long as the mutational process is sufficient to sustain some degree of functional diversity thermal adaptation can proceed it would therefore appear that the darwinian demon assumption is a robust approximation of the adaptive capacity of phytoplankton communities in other words thermal adaptation is very likely to be sufficiently rapid to keep up with global warming even for a temperature increase as large as 10 c over 100 years in fact maladaptation remains constant over time at the surface in most scenarios and even drops when the mutation rate is high fig 4e this latter observation stems from the fact that phytoplankton individuals divide faster as temperature increases generating more mutants and the phytoplankton community is able to adapt faster to seasonal changes as a result this is particularly true when thermal adaptation mostly relies on de novo diversity such as in the high mutation rate scenario fig 3a we then consider the effect of seasonal amplification with no change in the annually averaged temperature 0 c in the seasonal amplification case in fig 4 we observe that pp drops in every evolutionary scenarios from 8 in the darwinian demon scenario to 42 in the darwinian dummy scenario the other scenarios fall between these two extreme cases fig 4d the increased seasonality implies colder temperatures during the winter and warmer temperatures during the summer as temperatures prevailing during the winter bloom get colder fig 4a c the phytoplankton metabolism slows down fig 1 and productivity lowers accordingly this explains the productivity drop in the darwinian demon scenario in spite of adaptation being perfect fig 4d additionally when adaptation is imperfect the phytoplankton community progressively becomes unable to adapt to the increasingly large seasonal variation in temperature this increased maladaptation drives productivity down 22 28 and 31 for high intermediate and low mutation rates respectively fig 5 b therefore contrary to the previous case the model predicts that mutation rate is a key parameter when increasing the seasonal amplitude without changing the average temperature fig 4d to summarize pp increases with average temperature except in the darwinian dummy scenario but decreases with amplified seasonality when increasing temperatures and seasonality simultaneously in the darwinian demon scenario the negative effect of the seasonal amplification on pp is largely marginal compared to the positive effect of the average temperature increase 3 14 and 57 for 2 4 and 10 c respectively fig 4d however this is not necessarily the case when adaptation is imperfect the positive effect of a 10 c warming balances out the negative effect of seasonal amplification and leads to pp increasing by 41 when the mutation rate is high by 8 when it is intermediate and by 0 2 when the mutation rate is low fig 4e the phytoplankton still goes to extinction in the darwinian dummy scenario however for a 4 c warming the negative effect of seasonal amplification dominates and pp drops down 0 8 15 and 20 for high intermediate and low mutation rates fig 4e overall we find that primary productivity is expected to increase as global temperatures rise up in the context of a regime of climate change as long as phytoplankton communities are characterized by some capacity to adapt to temperature changes fig 4d and 5 this effect could nevertheless be mitigated by an increase in thermal maladaptation fig 4d e and 5 thermal maladaptation is expected to increase as short term variations of temperature become larger and faster fig 5 the extent of this increased maladaptation then depends on the adaptive capacity of phytoplankton communities determined by their characteristic mutation rate fig 4e the predictions of our model are therefore especially sensitive to the adaptive capacity of the phytoplankton when increased seasonality is considered fig 4d as a result our model predicts anything from a 31 to a 69 change in primary productivity depending on the assumed nature and amplitude of global warming change in temperature seasonality and extent of the phytoplankton adaptive capacity fig 4d and 5 4 discussion using a 1d ocean model we simulated the eco evolutionary response of a phytoplankton community to long term and short term temperature changes exploring a wide range of scenarios regarding the evolutionary properties of the phytoplankton from perfect adaptation to no adaptation at all and the regime of temperature changes we found that when climate change is considered solely as a long term trend of temperature increase the adaptive response of phytoplankton is in most cases sufficiently rapid for phytoplankton to persist and even to see its biomass production increase including for very large temperature increases e g 10 c over 100 years fig 4a the commonly used darwinian demon approximation then emerges as an acceptable representation of the adaptive capacity of the phytoplankton however when the amplitude of the seasonal variability of temperatures increases with the average temperatures which is likely to occur in a regime of climate change frölicher et al 2018 gruber et al 2021 oliver et al 2019 2018 the darwinian demon approximation is no longer valid we find that the efficacy of phytoplankton adaptation to increasingly extreme short term temperature changes is indeed very dependent on the assumed phytoplankton mutation rate the resulting maladaptation can substantially mitigate the prediction of increased biomass production in some cases when the amplitude of those short term events is large compared to that of the long term temperature increase biomass production actually drops down as climate changes fig 5 as primary production is one of the main driving forces of ocean biogeochemistry our study highlights the importance of phytoplankton adaptation for the resilience of marine ecosystems to climate change our results are however obtained in an idealized framework isolating the response of a local phytoplankton community to temperature changes alone several components of climate change and of the phytoplankton s response to it are therefore neglected first adaptation in the ocean is not a purely local process when traits are locally selected they can then be exported elsewhere through oceanic circulation and influence positively or not the phytoplankton adaptive response across the ocean leibold and norberg 2004 loeuille and leibold 2008 sauterey et al 2017 similarly climate change will not just affect temperatures but a multitude of other characteristics of oceanic systems nutrient availability ph water stratification horizontal circulation over long time scales i e the century but also through extreme compound events burger et al 2022 gruber et al 2021 we chose to evaluate in isolation the effect of temperature on the evolution of thermal niches and ignored those additional environmental stresses for simplicity however in natural systems under climate change these environmental stresses could affect phytoplankton growth and adaptive capacity brennan et al 2017 for instance climate change is expected to enhance thermal stratification which should lead to a decreased nutrient supply to the euphotic zone especially during summer climate change is also expected to increase depth of the mixed layer and the frequency and intensity of storms which both tend to increase nutrient supplies by vertical turbulence sallée et al 2021 predicting how nutrient limitation will evolve under climate change is therefore challenging moreover predicting the combined effect of nutrient limitations and temperature changes on phytoplankton growth and on the capacity of phytoplankton to adapt is a non trivial issue empirical evidence suggests for instance that the effect of temperature changes on phytoplankton growth could be largely nullified in nutrient depleted conditions marañón et al 2018 although those questions are beyond the scope of this study we provide some back of the envelope estimates and additional discussion of how changes in nutrient supply affect our results see supplementary material although the predicted increase in pp can be reversed by a concomitant decrease in nutrient supply the main results regarding the sensitivity of pp evolution to the phytoplankton adaptive capacity are qualitatively unaffected those additional simulations actually show that the capacity of phytoplankton to adapt to temperature changes is diminished under more nutrient limited conditions see supplementary discussion this suggests that such interacting effects between multiple environmental stressors might play a key role in determining the efficacy of phytoplankton adaptation across oceans e g in nutrient depleted vs nutrient rich regions and illustrates the need for further investigations to explore these questions we plan moving forward to implement our approach in a 3d model of ocean circulation such an integrated approach will allow evaluating in a spatially accurate environmental context how dispersal the spatial distribution of environmental stressors and their covariance across oceans affect phytoplankton adaptation and how this is expected to change in the context of climate change additionally several functional traits of phytoplankton communities are expected to evolve simultaneously in response to the combined selective pressures resulting from climate change e g cell size traits related to nutrient ph or light stresses this raises an intriguing question how does the simultaneous evolution of multiple traits influence the evolution of each singular trait see boyd et al 2018 and brennan et al 2017 for some empirically grounded elements of response and savage et al 2007 for a first attempt at modeling multiple traits evolution in phytoplankton similarly phytoplankton are not the only marine organisms that climate change will affect higher trophic levels characterized by a slower demography hence by a slower pace of evolutionary response will also be impacted by it the same goes for the recycling microbial loop that determines how much of the organic matter circulating into marine ecosystems is recycled toward the ocean surface and how much is exported to the deep ocean cherabier and ferrière 2022 extending our approach to simulate the simultaneous evolution of multiple traits as done in le gland et al 2021 and the adaptive evolution of populations other than phytoplankton would provide an ideal modeling framework to address those currently unresolved issues finally as our results suggest that the adaptive capacity of phytoplankton might be a determining factor of the resilience of marine ecosystems to climate change while our quantitative knowledge of what that capacity actually is remains very limited we argue that quantitative assessments of phytoplankton adaptive properties becomes an urgent matter although experimental work in laboratory remains a viable option we argue that combining global oceans models including phytoplankton evolution with observational data might constitute a complementary and promising avenue of research many macro scale phenomena such as the emergence of the global biogeography of the thermal niches of the phytoplankton or the response of the phytoplankton to rapid climatic events such as el niño la niña most likely involve to some extent thermal adaptation by the phytoplankton ocean wide meta genomic data sets e g chaffron et al 2021 sunagawa et al 2020 and satellite observations mouw et al 2019 are now becoming increasingly available and can be used to infer marine ecosystems composition and function in such macro scale contexts we argue that constraining the parametrization of evolutionary approaches such as ours integrated in 3d models of ocean circulation based on the ability of these coupled models to reproduce those observed global scale phenomena will constitute an efficient way to quantify the adaptive properties of marine ecosystems 5 concluding remarks our findings suggest that the resilience of marine ecosystems to climate change and more specifically to the multiplication of extreme climatic events will be determined by the ability of phytoplankton communities to adapt current earth system models implicitly assume that phytoplankton communities are perfectly adapted to their thermal environment at any time and are therefore likely to overestimate marine ecosystems resilience while the present exploratory work shows how our limited quantitative knowledge of phytoplankton adaptive properties limits our ability to predict the resilience of marine ecosystems to climate change it also paves the way toward improving that knowledge through the use of models of phytoplankton evolution ultimately we think that approaches such as ours may play a key

24153,inclusive and participatory decision making is a sustainable option for governments and decision makers to support real transformation and planning of policies and actions investigating and gathering the various views and opinions of stakeholders and citizens is particularly effective because it opens up a range of possibilities in co constructing the city of the future among urban areas requiring planning urban green infrastructures ugis represent spaces designed to improve the character of neighborhoods as well as to increase the well being of users to achieve these goals planners should adopt a design approach in which ugis projects are shaped by local community concerns rather than by market conventions in urban design focusing on green recreational areas this study employs an integrated approach combining revealed rp and stated preferences sp to investigate citizens preferences regarding urban parks in particular the experiment combines travel cost method tcm and discrete choice experiment dce for supporting a requalification project in an ex industrial area of turin italy in this way it was possible to understand which facilities can contribute to increasing the citizens well being and the overall efficiency of the ugis provision and maintenance the proposed methodology represents an operational and replicable procedure to support different renewal

travel cost method tcm random parameters logit rpl discrete choice experiments dce environmental management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction urban green infrastructures ugis have been shown to play an important role in addressing challenges related to the 2030 agenda and the united nations sustainable development goals sdgs this is due to ugi s ability to provide a range of benefits and values for urban dwellers in general and for public health in particular due to the increased physical activity and social cohesion fors et al 2021 gómez baggethun and barton 2013 meyer and trandafir 2023 to achieve some of these benefits the use of ugis by residents and city users is required in this sense the co design processes assume a key role for the final design of these spaces thanks to the direct inclusion of stakeholders molla 2020 rall et al 2019 participatory processes increase the workload within the conventional organization for the municipal strategic management of ugis but allow the definition of spaces in line with users actual needs ives et al 2017 rolf et al 2019 vaňo et al 2021 this implies that landscape practices cannot apply a linear logic in which projects develop chronologically and hierarchically from a plan established by authorities to more detailed projects jansson et al 2020 it becomes urgent a strategic approach characterized by a cyclical process in which planning design construction and maintenance are viewed from a long term perspective participatory processes in landscape planning were widely encouraged in international conventions in 1987 the united nations drafted the our common future report where they introduced the concept of participatory urban planning and sustainable development this report intended to solve the many problems created by planning activities in meeting citizens needs the local agenda 21 action plan united nations conference on environment and development 1992 the european landscape convention council of europe 2000 and the eu aarhus convention stec et al 2000 promoted the protection management and planning of the landscapes and organizes international co operation on landscape issues the importance of social inclusion in planning processes is also confirmed by the sustainable development goals established in 2015 as part of the 2030 agenda by the united nations in this perspective goal 11 3 aims to increase inclusive and sustainable urbanization and the capacity for participatory and integrated planning and management of human settlement in all countries by 2030 furthermore goal 16 7 aims to ensure a reactive decision making process inclusive participatory and representative at all levels participatory processes encourage different stakeholders to express their views in the planning process and maximizing benefits for people moreover the collaboration of professionals planners architects designers institutions and citizens in territorial and urban planning allows to carry out projects and works that meet the needs of the population and increase the achievement of the three pillars of sustainability with this in mind a detailed understanding of people s preferences about the socio ecological systems may inform urban planners to effectively provide and manage them to meet users needs mahmoudi farahani and maller 2018 it is well understood that preferences for green spaces may differ amongst individuals or groups of people depending on their sociodemographic background geographic setting and related cultural traditions and backgrounds bravi et al 2023 jakstis et al 2023 madureira et al 2018 several research applications have sought to expand the socio ecological knowledge of urban green spaces by connecting the domains of green space use and perception with participatory and design techniques pinto et al 2021 these views concern on the one hand the right design of interventions and on the other hand the rigorous assessment of the consequences both financial and social cultural and environmental in a sustainable development planning perspective some authors have focused on the use of multi criteria decision making mcdm approaches to guide policymakers and planners on what the best green strategy is and where it should be located in the city to maximize community benefits caprioli

mcdm and risk management rm techniques to optimize the design of a city park toward economic sustainability in mashhad iran in these researches people s opinions are integrated into the evaluation to a limited extent often taking into account a stakeholder representing them in the evaluation of the importance of the considered criteria however a recent movement to understand public opinion as a key part of decision making processes is arising hong et al 2018 hwang et al 2019 kopainsky et al 2017 shan 2012 voinov and gaddis 2008 bottero et al 2017 la riccia et al 2023 specifically in the urban context many researchers have explored the perception and economic value of different existing urban green infrastructures ugis e g bottero et al 2022 chen et al 2020 czembrowski and kronenberg 2016 dell anna et al 2022 dipeolu et al 2021 jensen et al 2021 tu et al 2016 xu and he 2022 zhang et al 2020 however only a few studies have addressed the issue hwang et al 2019 madureira et al 2018 van dongen and timmermans 2019 and they merely provide a ranking of attributes without a detailed valuation of them conversely this paper proposes an integrated approach that combines revealed preferences rp and stated preferences sp to investigate users preferences about a new urban park project to be created in a downgrade area in the city of turin north western italy this ex ante analysis aims to provide a valuation of the project features and simultaneously analyze the preference for the new park compared to the actual use of existing green areas for this reason the interviewees compare the park they usually visit with the new project and choose the one that provides the greatest utility assuming the maximization framework furthermore the marginal rate of substitution mrs for each attribute is also estimated by referring to each respondent s travel costs and actual visit frequency based on revealed data the analysis answers three questions will the new park be able to attract users in a city where the green areas are many what bundle of activities facilities is able most to meet the users needs can the social economic value of the new park offset at least in part the required maintenance costs therefore the analysis traces a path in defining efficient strategies that attract people to the urban park starting from the users behaviors and preferences in this way the project under analysis becomes a test bed to investigate the potential of the integrated approach proposed replicable in different cases and with other purposes to support municipalities in orienting their scarce resources and providing efficient policies and strategies after the introduction section 1 the paper is structured as follows section 2 presents a literature review of applications that jointly use rp and sp methods the methodological framework of the study and the methods used are presented in section 3 section 4 concerns the application to the case study the results are presented and discussed in section 5 the conclusions follow in section 6 the questionnaire translated into english is included in appendix b 2 joined revealed and stated preferences methods in literature in 1989 morikawa first proposed pooling rp and sp data to include non existing alternatives and a larger number of attributes in rp estimations morikawa 1989 from this proposal a variety of applications was developed as testified by more than 700 publications consulting the database scopus and web of science in september 2022 using the following string title abs key revealed preference and stated preference this analysis has also shown the first attempts at using this integrated approach around the 1990s then an increase of publications over 20 in 2005 and 30 in 2015 1994 was a prolific year in literature with the publications of adamowicz et al 1994 ben akiva et al 1994 bradley daly 1994 hensher 1994 morikawa 1994 swait et al 1994 vyvere 1994 apart from the work of adamowicz et al 1994 and ben akiva et al 1994 all the other publications are in the transportation sector simply limiting the research to transportation adding to the preview string the following keywords transportation or transport or mode the analysis has shown that about 50 of the previous results were developed in this field moreover the literature review has highlighted many experiments using this integrated method to analyze the demand for market goods adamowicz et al 1994 on the contrary unlike the present contribution fewer works were provided in the field of extra market valuation goods in particular a literature review performed on scopus and web of science databases result in 22 documents whose topic is connected with environmental economics the publications of adamowicz et al 1994 and adamowicz et al 1997 represented the first experiment in pooling rp and sp for valuing environmental amenities in particular they tested the combination of revealed and stated preference data for measuring recreational site choice behavior then the estimation of recreational demand and its benefits are examined by different authors by pooling rp and sp data concerning the recreational demand for example boxalla englin 2008 examines the impact of forest fires on recreation demand while atkinson whitehead 2015 for a mountain bike park similarly hoyos riera 2013 used rp data with sp data obtained with contingent behavior methods to compare reported past visits to mount jaizkibel a natural area located in the basque country spain with convergent validity to stated intended future trips whitehead et al 2008 estimated the changes in recreation demand for southern north carolina beaches whitehead et al 2010 expanded their previous work by exploring hypothetical scenarios of variation in beach width in explaining trip choices regarding the recreational benefits whitehead et al 2009 estimated the economic benefits of saginaw bay coastal marsh with the travel cost and contingent valuation methods a couple of papers are interested in the estimation of the benefits generated to residential locations earnhart 2001 estimated the green aesthetic benefits generated by the presence and quality of environmental amenities phaneuf et al 2013 proposed instead the combination of rp and sp data in the context of property value models for the nonmarket valuation of residential amenities cord et al 2015 explored spatial gradients preferences and motivations regarding short term recreation as a cultural ecosystem service deshazo et al 2015 collected both rp and sp data for valuing protection and recreational use of tropical rainforests in malaysia johnston et al 2015 quantified recreational benefit changes under delaware department of natural resources and environmental control beach nourishment and retreat scenarios wang et al 2017 combined rp and sp to measure the effects of park attribute improvement on the tourism demand and recreation benefits schmid et al 2021 used pooled rp and sp travel choice data of zurich workers to obtain mode specific values of travel time savings in particular they had also data on the respondents time use and expenditure allocation which enabled to estimate their value of leisure i e the opportunity value of liberated time when the duration of a committed activity such as travel is reduced conversely loomis 1997 observed the complementarity of rp and sp data through the investigation of recreation activities at a river in puerto rico the topic of recreational fishing is also widely analyzed by authors using the combination of rp and sp models beaumais appéré 2010 assessed the value of health risks related to recreational shellfish harvesting whitehead et al 2011 used telephone survey data on charter boat anglers to estimate demand models to for hire fishing limits in north carolina cha melstrom 2018 estimated recreational paddlefish anglers preferences for catch and release fishing whitehead lew 2020 modeled recreational fishing behavior and preferences hestetune et al 2020 and hindsley et al 2022 measured the demand for angling under current and future environmental conditions according to this analysis it is possible to state that the present paper represents the first application of joint sp and rp in urban design focusing on ugis provision and management this application is the first attempt where the citizens preferences for alternative features of a green area are investigated to help decision makers to design coherent and effective transformation policies and actions 3 methodology 3 1 methodological framework the methodological framework includes four steps questionnaire definition data collection econometric analysis and guidelines definition fig 1 the survey was structured on multi attribute choice sets that cover various aspects of the new urban park designed for the estimation of random utility models rums the first step involved the investigation of the literature and the analysis of both national and international real cases for the identification of their functions and characteristics then a focus group of experts in the field of planning policy and landscape architecture selected a set of attributes applicable to the case study under investigation and to turin s ugis once the set of attributes was defined the questionnaire was structured step 2 the first part of the survey aimed to collect information from the interviewees on the urban park features they usually visit moreover the place of residence and the frequency of visits to the park expressed in days per year were asked step 2a this last information constituted the rp data and made it possible to estimate the random parameters of the model in terms of costs for reaching the park and the number of visits expressed in days per year based on the data collected on rp a discrete choice experiment dce was designed for each interviewee more specifically the interviewee identifies the features of the park that he she usually visit and these are compared with alternative scenarios the orthogonal design generates different configurations based on the attributes defined in the design phase by the experts therefore in step 2b the interviewee selects between the park usually visited and a set of scenarios for the area a binary option is presented to each interviewee for four choice sets where the park usually visited remains fixed in contrast the attributes levels for the new park are changed to make the situation of the choice more realistic the features of the parks that the interviewees usually visit constituted the attributes of the alternative my park the customized sp choice sets were very helpful in creating a realistic rather than just hypothetical choice situation dubernet and axhausen 2020 louviere et al 2000 the questionnaire was administered through computer assisted face to face interviews to have the choice sets of the sp determined simultaneously with the answers previously given by each interviewee by the rp questions step 2c in detail the online survey was employed in the limesurvey tool www limesurvey org even if limesurvey is not directly programmed for dce it is able to properly generate random scenarios for each interviewee with a random function based on different choice sets defined in the orthogonal design the rp data were transformed into random variables step 3a so that the sp data can be analyzed through a random parameter logit rpl model step 3b once the coefficients of the variables were calculated the economic benefits of the new park were estimated step 3c furthermore the study proposed a selection of the attributes for the implementation of basse di stura park according to respondents needs step 3d the last step provided guidelines for policymakers and planners of the city of turin for the optimal management of public ugis step 4 3 2 econometric estimation choice experiment ce is a family of multi attribute methods that can be used for the use and non use values valuation associated with extra market goods sp set within the demand theory ce have its foundation in random utility maximization rum framework this technique states that consumer utility depends on the features of the good or services under examination louviere 2006 in practice different sets of choices also called alternatives or scenarios are presented to each respondent among which he she indicates the favorite each alternative describes the good by its features or attributes expressed with different degrees or levels in this way the interviewee evaluates the good as a mix of different attributes this method allows to obtain contingency tables that provide for each attribute the proportions of choice and an index to establish the degree of influence of the single attributes or the interaction level between them lancaster 1966 mcfadden 1974 thurstone 1927 let assume two alternatives belonging to a specific choice set a and a generic individual i distinct by a series of characteristics s and driven by rationality to select the alternative that maximizes his her utility p x s a is the probability that the alternative x defined as attributes vector is chosen by the individual belonging to the set of alternatives a given the individual s characteristics s and set a thus an individual behavior rule ibr maximizes a utility function belonging to a set of functions sibr which in turn maximize utility starting from this assumption and according to random utility model rum the greater the probability that a given product is preferred over the other alternatives available the higher the utility that its purchase can guarantee the individual evaluates the utility of an alternative according to the rum shown in eq 1 1 u i j v i j ε i j where u i j is the utility of the choice of the product j by the individual i v i j is the deterministic and observable utility ε i j is the unobserved random error term the observable utility v i j can be described as follows eq 2 2 v i j β i j x i j ε i j where x i j indicates a vector of observed attributes included in alternative j and β i j denotes the vector of the coefficients associated with x i j mcfadden 1974 linked the theoretical rum to the statistical discrete choice model with a specification that can be resolved in the multinomial logit mnl model or conditional logit cl model the parameters of the mnl model represented by the coefficients β can be obtained through a maximum likelihood estimator hanley et al 1998 by the multiple interviewee choices following the variation of the levels of the attributes the product characteristics influencing the individual s choices can be identified furthermore it is possible to identify the most significant attributes and implicitly an ordering of preference dell anna et al 2022 finally using the coefficients β obtained from the mnl it is possible to estimate the trade offs between attributes and evaluate how consumers jointly consider two or more of them according to the mnl specification the main assumption is that individuals exhibit homogeneity of tastes toward the investigated attributes as specified by scarpa thiene 2005 since train s 1998 pioneering study the development of this modeling has focused on the possibility of incorporating heterogeneity of consumer preferences into observed choice analysis models rpl model provides greater flexibility and allows parameters to vary across individuals as well as individual choices ghosh et al 2013 greene 2002 the coefficients of the utility function parameters are no longer constant but indexed by individuals and vary in the population according to a continuous probability distribution function which is usually assumed normal train 1998 this specification provides a more realistic representation of population preferences moreover rpl is not subject to the iia recruitment restrictions and internalizes two levels of heterogeneity the first is associated with the variability of the parameters while the second is linked to the differences between individuals in this application the rpl model is needed to combine information on the preferred attributes of the new park and the actual behavior represented by the green area usually used with the purpose to combine rp and sp a rpl was employed this form characterized by randomness in parameters hensher and greene 2003 accommodates heterogeneity as a continuous function of the same parameters underlying some ex ante specified distribution a random component in the parameters is introduced accordingly to eq 3 3 u i n β x i n η i n ε i n where ηin is a random term with zero mean whose distribution over individuals and alternatives generally depends on underlying parameters and observed data relating to alternative n and individual i and εin is a random term with zero mean that is iid over alternatives and does not depend on underlying parameters or data for any specific situation the variance of εin may not be identified separately from β so it is normalized to set the scale of utility since η is not given the unconditional choice probability is the logit integrated over all values of η weighted by its density as in the following eq 4 4 p n l n η f η ω d η random parameters are used to capture heterogeneity in preferences through their standard deviation or through the study of the interaction between the mean of the parameters and deterministic segmentation criteria in these cases it is assumed that random variables of the indirect utility function are probably not independent from the deterministic ones and that the variance of the random component is not constant between different individuals or for the same individual over time or in different situations the choice of the random variables is also linked to how the correlation between alternatives and the choice in different tasks is modelled moreover the choice of distribution for the random parameters is a sensitive point inappropriate choice of distribution may lead to bias or counterintuitive signs in the estimated parameters in this study for example unobserved factors may result in parameters that vary spatially between observations a fundamental parameter that can influence the choice and frequentation of green areas is the location of the respondent with respect to these spaces as an effect of gravitation if a spatial parameter is found to vary significantly between observations this implies that each observation has its own parameter therefore including random parameters that vary in the population according to a pre determined distribution allows for more reliable estimation and a better fit of the model to the data many distributions can be and have been used for the random parameters the most common will be the normal the same employed in this application to test the presence of a certain gravitational effect starting from the assumptions of tcm two parameters to be included in the rpl model were estimated travel cost and visit frequency the basic notion is that the economic valuation of recreational goods is related to the gravitational nature of demand behavior rp the estimation process is based on the observation of the relationship between visit frequency and travel expenses calculated based on the distance traveled plus other variables as time spent on the site the recreational activity carried out and so on national park service 1949 starting from this concept the distances travelled by each interviewee to reach the new park was calculated and considered as cost among the explanatory variables as mentioned above the result of a dce provides useful information about the relative importance of different attributes however the most valuable outcome of a dce is probably the marginal rate of substitution mrs marginal rates of substitution provide information about the rate at which respondents are willing to exchange one attribute for preferred levels of another attribute for example in the context under consideration this might be the amount of money individuals are willing to pay wtp to perform a certain activity in an urban park of all the information obtained with a dce mrs is the most likely to be used within other analyses to inform decision making since it is not always easy to derive the individual wtps of the green areas characteristics during the design phase we referred to the assumptions of the tcm for monetizing them in order to monetize distances from the new park we calculated an average cost of travel per km once the independent variables have been estimated the marginal rate of substitution for each characteristic can be calculated as follows 5 5 m r s β x β t c where β x is the coefficient of the characteristic x estimated and β t c is the travel cost coefficient the mrs was estimated to analyze the marginal effect on the probability of choice and ensures that the estimate can be brought back to the monetary scale 4 data and experimental design 4 1 case study and sample composition the case study under analysis is an area of 150 hectares called basse di stura within the municipality of turin italy fig 2 this site is located at the edge of the city and characterized by the proximity of the river stura for that reason it was initially used for agricultural functions as it is apparent for the presence of some farmhouses more recently factories and car dealerships have occupied the south and east portion of the area however for its natural potentials and strategic location local public administration has recently expressed an increasing interest in the area proposing an intensive requalification for the creation of a new urban park for the city bottero et al 2020 bottero et al 2021 since the costs of remediation are very high the city is willing to undertake this project if motivated by the citizens interest the present research is mainly devoted to supporting the municipality in the definition of efficiency strategies able to attract people in the area starting from the analyses of actual users behaviors and their preferences as well as the possibility in the future to use the new urban park a questionnaire was prepared for collecting the needed information the first version of the questionnaire was tested by a group of 20 experts and respondents that help us respectively in the improvement of the questionnaire from a scientific perspective and in the clarity of information and questions presented after that the final version was administered the interview was conducted through computer assisted face to face interviews to obtain a representative sample of the geographic area this sample was composed of residents with an age equal or higher than 18 years old and who have lived for at least one year in the city the collection of the data lasted about 12 months starting from may 2021 this long period was necessary to collect the answers of different targets of the population which using ugis in various ways and different seasons 4 2 survey questionnaire design the final version of the questionnaire consisted of five sections i the respondent s attitude regarding different types of green areas in the city ii the respondent s attitude concerning the urban park that he she has used the most in the last year iii the respondent s interest in the future park of basse di stura iv the respondent s preferences for possible transformation scenarios for the basse di stura area dce v demographic and socioeconomic data of the respondent the questionnaire translated into english is attached in appendix b the interview starts with an introduction section useful for limiting the sample target i e citizens with legal age 18 years old and those who have lived for at least one year in the city of turin moreover this introductive section is devoted to explaining the aim of the survey and to briefly describing basse di stura park and the municipality future scenarios for that area section i explores the habits of the respondent concerning the green areas that he she uses most so we ask for some information about the reasons and frequency of use of the selected green areas the approximate time spent there and the usual transport mode to get there in this section we also ask the respondent to approximately locate on the map him her home his her workplace and the green areas selected this phase is useful for understanding the usual travel of each person to go to some green areas section ii analyzes the yearly behavior of the respondent concerning a specific green area i e the urban park the respondent selects the urban park that he she most used in the last year among the complete list in the city of turin and as before expresses him her attitudes and habits such as frequency time spent the usual season of use and the mean of transport this section also includes a specific question on the characteristics of the park used in particular the respondent specifies the functions that he she remembers of the urban park selected this question is fundamental for the dce and the comparison between the park actually used and the different scenarios proposed for basse di stura section iii investigates the interest of the respondent in the transformation of basse di stura also examining the potential future habits in this section a map with the location of basse di stura area is provided to the respondents in order to have a clear idea where it is and how to reach it section iv gathers information about the respondent s preferences on the possible transformation scenarios for the basse di stura area through the dce method the respondent answers to four experiments and each experiment compares the park most used by the respondent and an alternative scenario for basse di stura the scenario for basse di stura is one of the 32 created through the orthogonal design performed in spss https www ibm com analytics spss statistics software with the attributes defined in the design phase during the focus group with the experts the attributes of the most used park do not change during the four experiments since they are related to the choice made by the respondent in section ii question 30 on the characteristics of the park usually visited for the basse di stura area 20 dummy variables are combined in the orthogonal design and related to the following 5 clusters of services social educational activities 1 educational farm no food crops and phytoremediation crops 2 educational tour on the industrial history of the area 3 social activities hub 4 urban allotment garden natural activities 5 camping site 6 birdwatching and nature trails of the biodiversity 7 butterfly farm 8 horse farm technological activities 9 land for no food crops for non food purposes 10 area to produce of bio energy e g solar panels 11 research centre 12 experimentation area of land phytoremediation sport activities 13 sports fields soccer tennis basket volley 14 skatepark roller skating spaces 15 equipment for outdoor sports 16 bicycle lane organised activities 17 children s play area 18 area bounded for dogs 19 study area 20 beaches along the river section v is devoted to the collection of the main socioeconomic and demographic data of each respondent such as age education level income and job position 5 results 5 1 descriptive analysis socioeconomic variables of the study population 492 subjects completed and returned the questionnaire 369 of whom were used for the analysis 75 of the total corresponding to those who answered all questions of the survey the main socioeconomic data of the respondents are shown in table 1 the sample appreciably represents the gender proportion in the city and covers different ages education levels and income ranges as it is possible to see in table 1 according to the age the sample is not perfectly representative of the turin population since there are a larger proportion of young people however following the procedures of other authors on the same topic e g del saz salazar and garcía menéndez 2007 mccormack et al 2014 the sampling scheme was designed to obtain a representative sample of city households considering the 34 districts of the city and for covering all the urban parks in turin additionally the sample derives from the face to face interviews collected in one year from may 2021 so it is based on the people who visit green areas according to the aim of this work we favoured an in situ approach because it can intercept the population with a greater interest in the survey topic reducing the representation of groups with lower rates of park use or nature appreciation respondents voluntarily participated in the survey and no monetary compensation is offered concerning the education level the sample follows the data provided by italian statistical bureau istat 2020a related to the turin province according to the data registered in 2020 the percentage of the population without an educational qualification is around 3 4 compared to our sample of around 2 3 elementary licenses 15 6 and middle school ones 30 5 compared to our sample of compulsory education around 36 at the same time the percentage of high school graduates and people with tertiary or higher education is around 53 compared to our sample of high education around 62 the slight differences between the percentages in the turin province and our sample can be perfectly justified by the fact that populations with higher levels of education are concentrated in cities that host universities such as turin istat 2020a regarding income the sample also follows the trend of turin as registered in 2020 by istat istat 2020b most of the population around 50 has an income between 1200 and 5000 month compared to our sample around 54 people with a high income more than 5000 month are around 20 perfectly in line with the sample whereas people who earn less than 1200 month are 31 compared to 25 of the sample the other socio economic characteristics are shown in table a1 appendix a table 2 shows the respondents habits and preferential activities in green areas of the city it is apparent from this table that many respondents 44 25 of the total currently prefer to spend outdoor activities in urban parks followed by people who use neighborhood gardens and areas bounded for dogs among the motivation to visit these green spaces in the city the respondents show their preference to relax enjoy the good weather and fresh air and to take a walk run and or cycling respondents often benefit from these green areas for a time between 30 minutes and 2 hours whereas they never stay for less than 15 minutes or more than 4 hours table 3 from these data it is apparent that the length of time spent is almost the same for the entire sample which stands at intermediate values for the day and season of visit the sample is largely heterogeneous moreover the survey gathered information on the time cost and transportation corresponding to visiting the various green areas table 4 most respondents reported that they visit urban parks starting from their home 86 38 and spending less than 5 min 48 35 to reach them respectively questions 4 and 25 in the questionnaire this last data is reliable since the city of turin is one of the greenest cities of europe and generally worldwide rich in parks and green areas as it possible to see in fig 2 coherently the mean distance from the starting point home or work is about 500 meters when the participants were asked the most common mean of transport used to go to the green areas the majority commented by walk 58 75 whereas 18 61 by public transports 13 89 by car and 8 75 by bike since the aim of the research is mainly focused on supporting the definition of coherent and strategic scenarios for the implementation of a new urban park in the downgraded area of basse di stura the survey also investigated the frequency of visit of the urban parks in the city table a 2 in appendix a this analysis allows to understand if there are some competitors in terms of proximity and substitution of the future park of basse di stura 5 2 econometric analysis as mentioned above this experiment is based on the hypothesis commonly accepted that green areas exert a gravitational effect on the residents living in their immediate proximity and that this decreases with increasing distance planning a new green area must therefore consider current preferences related to the use of urban parks this is the reason why the experiment takes into account the correlation between the choice and preferences related to the new park sp and the existent green areas that are represented by the travel costs and visit frequency to the preferred park at the moment of the interview rp the choice experiment concerning the new park must therefore be combined with the current preferences characterizing the interviewee this leads to a mixed structure where the error terms must be evaluated separately in this case rpl similar to the random coefficients model for linear regressions can be helpful table 5 shows the results of the reduced model where only the variables with acceptable significance of the estimated parameters are included considering that each respondent i e 369 answered 4 choice sets the total number of observations amounted to 1476 out of about twenty attributes services proposed to the interviewee in the choice sets see section 4 2 only six have a positive coefficient in order of importance educational tour rural lands research center play areas bounded for dogs or assigned to children and horses farm considering the initial groups of activities facilities presented in the questionnaire social educational natural technological sport and organized activities at least one type per group was identified by means of this analysis there are also three undesirable features the roller skating rinks the beach along the river and the study area which show a negative sign from the users standpoint the city of turin has many facilities organized for sport and probably there is no need to allocate an area with such environmental characteristics to this type of activity evidently the presence of a study area also does not seem coherent the constant for the specific alternative that in this case of a binary choice model represents the preferred green area at the interview moment has a significant but negative coefficient this result reveals in general a preference for the new park project or even better the possibility of commuting one s choice if certain activities or services are included in the new project the single mrss represents the opportunity costs to switch the visit from the actual park to the new one containing these different activities and facilities consistent with the general layout of the model travel cost and visit frequency have a correct sign and good significance level the standard deviations of the random parameters are also significant these results validate both the tcm assumptions and the expectations of the rpl model finally table 6 shows the estimate for the entire city of turin of the mean of the access cost to green areas independently of their different characteristics and distances recalling that urban parks are a public good whose access is not regulated these estimates represent useful monetary indicators for valuing the benefits costs if one proceeds toward a project s feasibility study these results could also guide the municipality choices which can propose for example the realization of cultivated rural lands combined with education and horse farms or the organization of the area as a cultural center grounded on the research center the educational farm and the educational tours 6 discussion users of green areas do not pay a fee to access them but that does not mean the public good has no economic value for example the maintenance costs in charge to public administration show that conservation is at least necessary in this work a valuation of the potential benefits of new green space has been proposed to compare the provision costs and benefits that would be gained the model joins an approach based on rp with dce where consumers preferences are hypothetical the latter is however influenced by the distances between the respondent s home and the new park not all types of activities services presented here were great results services such as the butterfly house or the beach do not seem to meet great interest while more replaceable and widespread activities appear more familiar and attractive or irreplaceable as for example children and dogs areas this may be trivial less obvious are the general results which nonetheless provide some important indications to the policy makers the estimation of tmrs provides the following values the inclusion of the various services offered increases the benefit in a range that goes from 3 64 to 7 33 per user the calculation of the overall annual benefits is in these cases strongly influenced by the number of actual and potential users this number is not easily identifiable which is why residents can be considered as total beneficiaries taking into account that urban planning standard is calculated as the square meters of green areas per residents in 2019 9 700 000 were spent in the city of turin on the maintenance of urban green areas città di torino 2021 an amount well above the present recreational use benefits just calculated equal to 4 707 254 per year for a population of 858 205 residents in 2021 however if the park will contain no unique features such as a dog area or a play area for children the recreational use benefit is lower because the park will gather a smaller catchment area i e the one closest to park in particular the inclusion of these services increases the benefit in an average of 4 485 per user and the population catched is equal to 8 917 residents living inside the 800 m i e around 10 minutes walk from the park this produce a total recreational benefit equal to 39 993 per year additionally considering that the services provided by ugis include various ecosystem functions this estimate must be considered only as a wtp for recreational use 7 conclusions this study proposes an innovative integration of rp and sp methods for supporting the public administration in considering citizens preferences to design of a new urban park in north western italy this methodology can be replicated in different areas and with other planning and management purposes to support public bodies in orienting their resources and providing efficient policies and strategies these main objectives are pursued by the application of this methodology identyfing the preferred project features and valuing the actual recreational value considering a preference for the new park versus the existent ugis from the results the following conclusions and implications were reached first the study indicates that a larger percentage of the sampled population while remaining conditioned by the nearest location of the current green areas shows an interest in the new park but this also implies that most of the population has access to the nearest parks and derives the greatest benefit this means that residents have thought the new park will improve their actual level of utility to the extent that certain activities or services are included or excluded from the project considering the high standard of green areas per inhabitant in turin which means high maintenance costs officials and agencies responsible for formulating policies and developing programs to deliver and manage ugis should focus on improving the quality and not just the quantity of urban green areas secondly the study has also revealed the preferences for certain project features of the future park the favorite activities for basse di stura park are the educational tour horses farm cultivated lands research center and play areas assigned to children or bounded for dogs this result suggests that some new facilities are preferred together with those already present in the existent green areas the consequence is that urban planners and municipal green management must adopt programs related to the provision of green areas to the specific choices of the population to avoid wasting scarce economic resources a second consideration must be made regarding a bottom up investment planning process in this case it seems necessary to investigate the preferences and needs of the population and the final design of ugis should also be informed by other considerations such as cost location and accessibility in other words it is only by looking at the demand side of this type of services that supply can be optimized by improving the overall well being and quality of urban life finally it should be noted that the use of a mixed model based on rp and sp has helped to avoid some typical biases of the environmental value elicitation process using sp such as for example the cvm contingent valuation method conversely it cannot eliminate the issues associated with sample surveys the size and representativeness of the sample unfortunately representative sample surveys of the entire city population would be particularly burdensome for the municipality and are seldom implemented this would be added to the high costs of providing and maintaining green areas this experiment wants to be a small contribution even if not perfectly exhaustive and definitive indeed a limitation of this work lies in the fact that the sample is not perfectly representative of the statistical characteristics of the whole population the resulting sample based on an in situ approach was designed to cover all the urban parks in turin and the 34 districts of the city but it has produced a larger proportion of young people with high education a future improvement of the work will certainly develop a probability sample with the aim to represent every member of the population also those less interested in park use and visit and verify the differences with the current analysis moreover the survey was developed immediately after the covid 19 pandemic this could have produced a distorting effect on the uses and habits of urban parks the administration of the questionnaire in a subsequent period could correct some distortions due to the extraordinary event lived between 2019 and 2022 worldwide and in particular in italy

24153,inclusive and participatory decision making is a sustainable option for governments and decision makers to support real transformation and planning of policies and actions investigating and gathering the various views and opinions of stakeholders and citizens is particularly effective because it opens up a range of possibilities in co constructing the city of the future among urban areas requiring planning urban green infrastructures ugis represent spaces designed to improve the character of neighborhoods as well as to increase the well being of users to achieve these goals planners should adopt a design approach in which ugis projects are shaped by local community concerns rather than by market conventions in urban design focusing on green recreational areas this study employs an integrated approach combining revealed rp and stated preferences sp to investigate citizens preferences regarding urban parks in particular the experiment combines travel cost method tcm and discrete choice experiment dce for supporting a requalification project in an ex industrial area of turin italy in this way it was possible to understand which facilities can contribute to increasing the citizens well being and the overall efficiency of the ugis provision and maintenance the proposed methodology represents an operational and replicable procedure to support different renewal projects in which citizens opinions are crucial for developing long term sustainable socio ecological plans and actions keywords revealed and stated preferences models urban green infrastructures ugis travel cost method tcm random parameters logit rpl discrete choice experiments dce environmental management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction urban green infrastructures ugis have been shown to play an important role in addressing challenges related to the 2030 agenda and the united nations sustainable development goals sdgs this is due to ugi s ability to provide a range of benefits and values for urban dwellers in general and for public health in particular due to the increased physical activity and social cohesion fors et al 2021 gómez baggethun and barton 2013 meyer and trandafir 2023 to achieve some of these benefits the use of ugis by residents and city users is required in this sense the co design processes assume a key role for the final design of these spaces thanks to the direct inclusion of stakeholders molla 2020 rall et al 2019 participatory processes increase the workload within the conventional organization for the municipal strategic management of ugis but allow the definition of spaces in line with users actual needs ives et al 2017 rolf et al 2019 vaňo et al 2021 this implies that landscape practices cannot apply a linear logic in which projects develop chronologically and hierarchically from a plan established by authorities to more detailed projects jansson et al 2020 it becomes urgent a strategic approach characterized by a cyclical process in which planning design construction and maintenance are viewed from a long term perspective participatory processes in landscape planning were widely encouraged in international conventions in 1987 the united nations drafted the our common future report where they introduced the concept of participatory urban planning and sustainable development this report intended to solve the many problems created by planning activities in meeting citizens needs the local agenda 21 action plan united nations conference on environment and development 1992 the european landscape convention council of europe 2000 and the eu aarhus convention stec et al 2000 promoted the protection management and planning of the landscapes and organizes international co operation on landscape issues the importance of social inclusion in planning processes is also confirmed by the sustainable development goals established in 2015 as part of the 2030 agenda by the united nations in this perspective goal 11 3 aims to increase inclusive and sustainable urbanization and the capacity for participatory and integrated planning and management of human settlement in all countries by 2030 furthermore goal 16 7 aims to ensure a reactive decision making process inclusive participatory and representative at all levels participatory processes encourage different stakeholders to express their views in the planning process and maximizing benefits for people moreover the collaboration of professionals planners architects designers institutions and citizens in territorial and urban planning allows to carry out projects and works that meet the needs of the population and increase the achievement of the three pillars of sustainability with this in mind a detailed understanding of people s preferences about the socio ecological systems may inform urban planners to effectively provide and manage them to meet users needs mahmoudi farahani and maller 2018 it is well understood that preferences for green spaces may differ amongst individuals or groups of people depending on their sociodemographic background geographic setting and related cultural traditions and backgrounds bravi et al 2023 jakstis et al 2023 madureira et al 2018 several research applications have sought to expand the socio ecological knowledge of urban green spaces by connecting the domains of green space use and perception with participatory and design techniques pinto et al 2021 these views concern on the one hand the right design of interventions and on the other hand the rigorous assessment of the consequences both financial and social cultural and environmental in a sustainable development planning perspective some authors have focused on the use of multi criteria decision making mcdm approaches to guide policymakers and planners on what the best green strategy is and where it should be located in the city to maximize community benefits caprioli et al 2023 kasyanov and silin 2019 li et al 2022 srdjevic et al 2022 nesticò et al 2022 compare various mcdm methods such as analytic hierarchy process ahp elimination et choix traduisant la realité electre tecnique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis and compromise ranking method vikor to select among various project alternatives those that can best contribute to a circular economy and counteract the negative effects of urbanization through the provision of ecosystem services li et al 2022 combined geographic information systems gis and fuzzy hierarchical

mcdm and risk management rm techniques to optimize the design of a city park toward economic sustainability in mashhad iran in these researches people s opinions are integrated into the evaluation to a limited extent often taking into account a stakeholder representing them in the evaluation of the importance of the considered criteria however a recent movement to understand public opinion as a key part of decision making processes is arising hong et al 2018 hwang et al 2019 kopainsky et al 2017 shan 2012 voinov and gaddis 2008 bottero et al 2017 la riccia et al 2023 specifically in the urban context many researchers have explored the perception and economic value of different existing urban green infrastructures ugis e g bottero et al 2022 chen et al 2020 czembrowski and kronenberg 2016 dell anna et al 2022 dipeolu et al 2021 jensen et al 2021 tu et al 2016 xu and he 2022 zhang et al 2020 however only a few studies have addressed the issue hwang et al 2019 madureira et al 2018 van dongen and timmermans 2019 and they merely provide a ranking of attributes without a detailed valuation of them conversely this paper proposes an integrated approach that combines revealed preferences rp and stated preferences sp to investigate users preferences about a new urban park project to be created in a downgrade area in the city of turin north western italy this ex ante analysis aims to provide a valuation of the project features and simultaneously analyze the preference for the new park compared to the actual use of existing green areas for this reason the interviewees compare the park they usually visit with the new project and choose the one that provides the greatest utility assuming the maximization framework furthermore the marginal rate of substitution mrs for each attribute is also estimated by referring to each respondent s travel costs and actual visit frequency based on revealed data the analysis answers three questions will the new park be able to attract users in a city where the green areas are many what bundle of activities facilities is able most to meet the users needs can the social economic value of the new park offset at least in part the required maintenance costs therefore the analysis traces a path in defining efficient strategies that attract people to the urban park starting from the users behaviors and preferences in this way the project under analysis becomes a test bed to investigate the potential of the integrated approach proposed replicable in different cases and with other purposes to support municipalities in orienting their scarce resources and providing efficient policies and strategies after the introduction section 1 the paper is structured as follows section 2 presents a literature review of applications that jointly use rp and sp methods the methodological framework of the study and the methods used are presented in section 3 section 4 concerns the application to the case study the results are presented and discussed in section 5 the conclusions follow in section 6 the questionnaire translated into english is included in appendix b 2 joined revealed and stated preferences methods in literature in 1989 morikawa first proposed pooling rp and sp data to include non existing alternatives and a larger number of attributes in rp estimations morikawa 1989 from this proposal a variety of applications was developed as testified by more than 700 publications consulting the database scopus and web of science in september 2022 using the following string title abs key revealed preference and stated preference this analysis has also shown the first attempts at using this integrated approach around the 1990s then an increase of publications over 20 in 2005 and 30 in 2015 1994 was a prolific year in literature with the publications of adamowicz et al 1994 ben akiva et al 1994 bradley daly 1994 hensher 1994 morikawa 1994 swait et al 1994 vyvere 1994 apart from the work of adamowicz et al 1994 and ben akiva et al 1994 all the other publications are in the transportation sector simply limiting the research to transportation adding to the preview string the following keywords transportation or transport or mode the analysis has shown that about 50 of the previous results were developed in this field moreover the literature review has highlighted many experiments using this integrated method to analyze the demand for market goods adamowicz et al 1994 on the contrary unlike the present contribution fewer works were provided in the field of extra market valuation goods in particular a literature review performed on scopus and web of science databases result in 22 documents whose topic is connected with environmental economics the publications of adamowicz et al 1994 and adamowicz et al 1997 represented the first experiment in pooling rp and sp for valuing environmental amenities in particular they tested the combination of revealed and stated preference data for measuring recreational site choice behavior then the estimation of recreational demand and its benefits are examined by different authors by pooling rp and sp data concerning the recreational demand for example boxalla englin 2008 examines the impact of forest fires on recreation demand while atkinson whitehead 2015 for a mountain bike park similarly hoyos riera 2013 used rp data with sp data obtained with contingent behavior methods to compare reported past visits to mount jaizkibel a natural area located in the basque country spain with convergent validity to stated intended future trips whitehead et al 2008 estimated the changes in recreation demand for southern north carolina beaches whitehead et al 2010 expanded their previous work by exploring hypothetical scenarios of variation in beach width in explaining trip choices regarding the recreational benefits whitehead et al 2009 estimated the economic benefits of saginaw bay coastal marsh with the travel cost and contingent valuation methods a couple of papers are interested in the estimation of the benefits generated to residential locations earnhart 2001 estimated the green aesthetic benefits generated by the presence and quality of environmental amenities phaneuf et al 2013 proposed instead the combination of rp and sp data in the context of property value models for the nonmarket valuation of residential amenities cord et al 2015 explored spatial gradients preferences and motivations regarding short term recreation as a cultural ecosystem service deshazo et al 2015 collected both rp and sp data for valuing protection and recreational use of tropical rainforests in malaysia johnston et al 2015 quantified recreational benefit changes under delaware department of natural resources and environmental control beach nourishment and retreat scenarios wang et al 2017 combined rp and sp to measure the effects of park attribute improvement on the tourism demand and recreation benefits schmid et al 2021 used pooled rp and sp travel choice data of zurich workers to obtain mode specific values of travel time savings in particular they had also data on the respondents time use and expenditure allocation which enabled to estimate their value of leisure i e the opportunity value of liberated time when the duration of a committed activity such as travel is reduced conversely loomis 1997 observed the complementarity of rp and sp data through the investigation of recreation activities at a river in puerto rico the topic of recreational fishing is also widely analyzed by authors using the combination of rp and sp models beaumais appéré 2010 assessed the value of health risks related to recreational shellfish harvesting whitehead et al 2011 used telephone survey data on charter boat anglers to estimate demand models to for hire fishing limits in north carolina cha melstrom 2018 estimated recreational paddlefish anglers preferences for catch and release fishing whitehead lew 2020 modeled recreational fishing behavior and preferences hestetune et al 2020 and hindsley et al 2022 measured the demand for angling under current and future environmental conditions according to this analysis it is possible to state that the present paper represents the first application of joint sp and rp in urban design focusing on ugis provision and management this application is the first attempt where the citizens preferences for alternative features of a green area are investigated to help decision makers to design coherent and effective transformation policies and actions 3 methodology 3 1 methodological framework the methodological framework includes four steps questionnaire definition data collection econometric analysis and guidelines definition fig 1 the survey was structured on multi attribute choice sets that cover various aspects of the new urban park designed for the estimation of random utility models rums the first step involved the investigation of the literature and the analysis of both national and international real cases for the identification of their functions and characteristics then a focus group of experts in the field of planning policy and landscape architecture selected a set of attributes applicable to the case study under investigation and to turin s ugis once the set of attributes was defined the questionnaire was structured step 2 the first part of the survey aimed to collect information from the interviewees on the urban park features they usually visit moreover the place of residence and the frequency of visits to the park expressed in days per year were asked step 2a this last information constituted the rp data and made it possible to estimate the random parameters of the model in terms of costs for reaching the park and the number of visits expressed in days per year based on the data collected on rp a discrete choice experiment dce was designed for each interviewee more specifically the interviewee identifies the features of the park that he she usually visit and these are compared with alternative scenarios the orthogonal design generates different configurations based on the attributes defined in the design phase by the experts therefore in step 2b the interviewee selects between the park usually visited and a set of scenarios for the area a binary option is presented to each interviewee for four choice sets where the park usually visited remains fixed in contrast the attributes levels for the new park are changed to make the situation of the choice more realistic the features of the parks that the interviewees usually visit constituted the attributes of the alternative my park the customized sp choice sets were very helpful in creating a realistic rather than just hypothetical choice situation dubernet and axhausen 2020 louviere et al 2000 the questionnaire was administered through computer assisted face to face interviews to have the choice sets of the sp determined simultaneously with the answers previously given by each interviewee by the rp questions step 2c in detail the online survey was employed in the limesurvey tool www limesurvey org even if limesurvey is not directly programmed for dce it is able to properly generate random scenarios for each interviewee with a random function based on different choice sets defined in the orthogonal design the rp data were transformed into random variables step 3a so that the sp data can be analyzed through a random parameter logit rpl model step 3b once the coefficients of the variables were calculated the economic benefits of the new park were estimated step 3c furthermore the study proposed a selection of the attributes for the implementation of basse di stura park according to respondents needs step 3d the last step provided guidelines for policymakers and planners of the city of turin for the optimal management of public ugis step 4 3 2 econometric estimation choice experiment ce is a family of multi attribute methods that can be used for the use and non use values valuation associated with extra market goods sp set within the demand theory ce have its foundation in random utility maximization rum framework this technique states that consumer utility depends on the features of the good or services under examination louviere 2006 in practice different sets of choices also called alternatives or scenarios are presented to each respondent among which he she indicates the favorite each alternative describes the good by its features or attributes expressed with different degrees or levels in this way the interviewee evaluates the good as a mix of different attributes this method allows to obtain contingency tables that provide for each attribute the proportions of choice and an index to establish the degree of influence of the single attributes or the interaction level between them lancaster 1966 mcfadden 1974 thurstone 1927 let assume two alternatives belonging to a specific choice set a and a generic individual i distinct by a series of characteristics s and driven by rationality to select the alternative that maximizes his her utility p x s a is the probability that the alternative x defined as attributes vector is chosen by the individual belonging to the set of alternatives a given the individual s characteristics s and set a thus an individual behavior rule ibr maximizes a utility function belonging to a set of functions sibr which in turn maximize utility starting from this assumption and according to random utility model rum the greater the probability that a given product is preferred over the other alternatives available the higher the utility that its purchase can guarantee the individual evaluates the utility of an alternative according to the rum shown in eq 1 1 u i j v i j ε i j where u i j is the utility of the choice of the product j by the individual i v i j is the deterministic and observable utility ε i j is the unobserved random error term the observable utility v i j can be described as follows eq 2 2 v i j β i j x i j ε i j where x i j indicates a vector of observed attributes included in alternative j and β i j denotes the vector of the coefficients associated with x i j mcfadden 1974 linked the theoretical rum to the statistical discrete choice model with a specification that can be resolved in the multinomial logit mnl model or conditional logit cl model the parameters of the mnl model represented by the coefficients β can be obtained through a maximum likelihood estimator hanley et al 1998 by the multiple interviewee choices following the variation of the levels of the attributes the product characteristics influencing the individual s choices can be identified furthermore it is possible to identify the most significant attributes and implicitly an ordering of preference dell anna et al 2022 finally using the coefficients β obtained from the mnl it is possible to estimate the trade offs between attributes and evaluate how consumers jointly consider two or more of them according to the mnl specification the main assumption is that individuals exhibit homogeneity of tastes toward the investigated attributes as specified by scarpa thiene 2005 since train s 1998 pioneering study the development of this modeling has focused on the possibility of incorporating heterogeneity of consumer preferences into observed choice analysis models rpl model provides greater flexibility and allows parameters to vary across individuals as well as individual choices ghosh et al 2013 greene 2002 the coefficients of the utility function parameters are no longer constant but indexed by individuals and vary in the population according to a continuous probability distribution function which is usually assumed normal train 1998 this specification provides a more realistic representation of population preferences moreover rpl is not subject to the iia recruitment restrictions and internalizes two levels of heterogeneity the first is associated with the variability of the parameters while the second is linked to the differences between individuals in this application the rpl model is needed to combine information on the preferred attributes of the new park and the actual behavior represented by the green area usually used with the purpose to combine rp and sp a rpl was employed this form characterized by randomness in parameters hensher and greene 2003 accommodates heterogeneity as a continuous function of the same parameters underlying some ex ante specified distribution a random component in the parameters is introduced accordingly to eq 3 3 u i n β x i n η i n ε i n where ηin is a random term with zero mean whose distribution over individuals and alternatives generally depends on underlying parameters and observed data relating to alternative n and individual i and εin is a random term with zero mean that is iid over alternatives and does not depend on underlying parameters or data for any specific situation the variance of εin may not be identified separately from β so it is normalized to set the scale of utility since η is not given the unconditional choice probability is the logit integrated over all values of η weighted by its density as in the following eq 4 4 p n l n η f η ω d η random parameters are used to capture heterogeneity in preferences through their standard deviation or through the study of the interaction between the mean of the parameters and deterministic segmentation criteria in these cases it is assumed that random variables of the indirect utility function are probably not independent from the deterministic ones and that the variance of the random component is not constant between different individuals or for the same individual over time or in different situations the choice of the random variables is also linked to how the correlation between alternatives and the choice in different tasks is modelled moreover the choice of distribution for the random parameters is a sensitive point inappropriate choice of distribution may lead to bias or counterintuitive signs in the estimated parameters in this study for example unobserved factors may result in parameters that vary spatially between observations a fundamental parameter that can influence the choice and frequentation of green areas is the location of the respondent with respect to these spaces as an effect of gravitation if a spatial parameter is found to vary significantly between observations this implies that each observation has its own parameter therefore including random parameters that vary in the population according to a pre determined distribution allows for more reliable estimation and a better fit of the model to the data many distributions can be and have been used for the random parameters the most common will be the normal the same employed in this application to test the presence of a certain gravitational effect starting from the assumptions of tcm two parameters to be included in the rpl model were estimated travel cost and visit frequency the basic notion is that the economic valuation of recreational goods is related to the gravitational nature of demand behavior rp the estimation process is based on the observation of the relationship between visit frequency and travel expenses calculated based on the distance traveled plus other variables as time spent on the site the recreational activity carried out and so on national park service 1949 starting from this concept the distances travelled by each interviewee to reach the new park was calculated and considered as cost among the explanatory variables as mentioned above the result of a dce provides useful information about the relative importance of different attributes however the most valuable outcome of a dce is probably the marginal rate of substitution mrs marginal rates of substitution provide information about the rate at which respondents are willing to exchange one attribute for preferred levels of another attribute for example in the context under consideration this might be the amount of money individuals are willing to pay wtp to perform a certain activity in an urban park of all the information obtained with a dce mrs is the most likely to be used within other analyses to inform decision making since it is not always easy to derive the individual wtps of the green areas characteristics during the design phase we referred to the assumptions of the tcm for monetizing them in order to monetize distances from the new park we calculated an average cost of travel per km once the independent variables have been estimated the marginal rate of substitution for each characteristic can be calculated as follows 5 5 m r s β x β t c where β x is the coefficient of the characteristic x estimated and β t c is the travel cost coefficient the mrs was estimated to analyze the marginal effect on the probability of choice and ensures that the estimate can be brought back to the monetary scale 4 data and experimental design 4 1 case study and sample composition the case study under analysis is an area of 150 hectares called basse di stura within the municipality of turin italy fig 2 this site is located at the edge of the city and characterized by the proximity of the river stura for that reason it was initially used for agricultural functions as it is apparent for the presence of some farmhouses more recently factories and car dealerships have occupied the south and east portion of the area however for its natural potentials and strategic location local public administration has recently expressed an increasing interest in the area proposing an intensive requalification for the creation of a new urban park for the city bottero et al 2020 bottero et al 2021 since the costs of remediation are very high the city is willing to undertake this project if motivated by the citizens interest the present research is mainly devoted to supporting the municipality in the definition of efficiency strategies able to attract people in the area starting from the analyses of actual users behaviors and their preferences as well as the possibility in the future to use the new urban park a questionnaire was prepared for collecting the needed information the first version of the questionnaire was tested by a group of 20 experts and respondents that help us respectively in the improvement of the questionnaire from a scientific perspective and in the clarity of information and questions presented after that the final version was administered the interview was conducted through computer assisted face to face interviews to obtain a representative sample of the geographic area this sample was composed of residents with an age equal or higher than 18 years old and who have lived for at least one year in the city the collection of the data lasted about 12 months starting from may 2021 this long period was necessary to collect the answers of different targets of the population which using ugis in various ways and different seasons 4 2 survey questionnaire design the final version of the questionnaire consisted of five sections i the respondent s attitude regarding different types of green areas in the city ii the respondent s attitude concerning the urban park that he she has used the most in the last year iii the respondent s interest in the future park of basse di stura iv the respondent s preferences for possible transformation scenarios for the basse di stura area dce v demographic and socioeconomic data of the respondent the questionnaire translated into english is attached in appendix b the interview starts with an introduction section useful for limiting the sample target i e citizens with legal age 18 years old and those who have lived for at least one year in the city of turin moreover this introductive section is devoted to explaining the aim of the survey and to briefly describing basse di stura park and the municipality future scenarios for that area section i explores the habits of the respondent concerning the green areas that he she uses most so we ask for some information about the reasons and frequency of use of the selected green areas the approximate time spent there and the usual transport mode to get there in this section we also ask the respondent to approximately locate on the map him her home his her workplace and the green areas selected this phase is useful for understanding the usual travel of each person to go to some green areas section ii analyzes the yearly behavior of the respondent concerning a specific green area i e the urban park the respondent selects the urban park that he she most used in the last year among the complete list in the city of turin and as before expresses him her attitudes and habits such as frequency time spent the usual season of use and the mean of transport this section also includes a specific question on the characteristics of the park used in particular the respondent specifies the functions that he she remembers of the urban park selected this question is fundamental for the dce and the comparison between the park actually used and the different scenarios proposed for basse di stura section iii investigates the interest of the respondent in the transformation of basse di stura also examining the potential future habits in this section a map with the location of basse di stura area is provided to the respondents in order to have a clear idea where it is and how to reach it section iv gathers information about the respondent s preferences on the possible transformation scenarios for the basse di stura area through the dce method the respondent answers to four experiments and each experiment compares the park most used by the respondent and an alternative scenario for basse di stura the scenario for basse di stura is one of the 32 created through the orthogonal design performed in spss https www ibm com analytics spss statistics software with the attributes defined in the design phase during the focus group with the experts the attributes of the most used park do not change during the four experiments since they are related to the choice made by the respondent in section ii question 30 on the characteristics of the park usually visited for the basse di stura area 20 dummy variables are combined in the orthogonal design and related to the following 5 clusters of services social educational activities 1 educational farm no food crops and phytoremediation crops 2 educational tour on the industrial history of the area 3 social activities hub 4 urban allotment garden natural activities 5 camping site 6 birdwatching and nature trails of the biodiversity 7 butterfly farm 8 horse farm technological activities 9 land for no food crops for non food purposes 10 area to produce of bio energy e g solar panels 11 research centre 12 experimentation area of land phytoremediation sport activities 13 sports fields soccer tennis basket volley 14 skatepark roller skating spaces 15 equipment for outdoor sports 16 bicycle lane organised activities 17 children s play area 18 area bounded for dogs 19 study area 20 beaches along the river section v is devoted to the collection of the main socioeconomic and demographic data of each respondent such as age education level income and job position 5 results 5 1 descriptive analysis socioeconomic variables of the study population 492 subjects completed and returned the questionnaire 369 of whom were used for the analysis 75 of the total corresponding to those who answered all questions of the survey the main socioeconomic data of the respondents are shown in table 1 the sample appreciably represents the gender proportion in the city and covers different ages education levels and income ranges as it is possible to see in table 1 according to the age the sample is not perfectly representative of the turin population since there are a larger proportion of young people however following the procedures of other authors on the same topic e g del saz salazar and garcía menéndez 2007 mccormack et al 2014 the sampling scheme was designed to obtain a representative sample of city households considering the 34 districts of the city and for covering all the urban parks in turin additionally the sample derives from the face to face interviews collected in one year from may 2021 so it is based on the people who visit green areas according to the aim of this work we favoured an in situ approach because it can intercept the population with a greater interest in the survey topic reducing the representation of groups with lower rates of park use or nature appreciation respondents voluntarily participated in the survey and no monetary compensation is offered concerning the education level the sample follows the data provided by italian statistical bureau istat 2020a related to the turin province according to the data registered in 2020 the percentage of the population without an educational qualification is around 3 4 compared to our sample of around 2 3 elementary licenses 15 6 and middle school ones 30 5 compared to our sample of compulsory education around 36 at the same time the percentage of high school graduates and people with tertiary or higher education is around 53 compared to our sample of high education around 62 the slight differences between the percentages in the turin province and our sample can be perfectly justified by the fact that populations with higher levels of education are concentrated in cities that host universities such as turin istat 2020a regarding income the sample also follows the trend of turin as registered in 2020 by istat istat 2020b most of the population around 50 has an income between 1200 and 5000 month compared to our sample around 54 people with a high income more than 5000 month are around 20 perfectly in line with the sample whereas people who earn less than 1200 month are 31 compared to 25 of the sample the other socio economic characteristics are shown in table a1 appendix a table 2 shows the respondents habits and preferential activities in green areas of the city it is apparent from this table that many respondents 44 25 of the total currently prefer to spend outdoor activities in urban parks followed by people who use neighborhood gardens and areas bounded for dogs among the motivation to visit these green spaces in the city the respondents show their preference to relax enjoy the good weather and fresh air and to take a walk run and or cycling respondents often benefit from these green areas for a time between 30 minutes and 2 hours whereas they never stay for less than 15 minutes or more than 4 hours table 3 from these data it is apparent that the length of time spent is almost the same for the entire sample which stands at intermediate values for the day and season of visit the sample is largely heterogeneous moreover the survey gathered information on the time cost and transportation corresponding to visiting the various green areas table 4 most respondents reported that they visit urban parks starting from their home 86 38 and spending less than 5 min 48 35 to reach them respectively questions 4 and 25 in the questionnaire this last data is reliable since the city of turin is one of the greenest cities of europe and generally worldwide rich in parks and green areas as it possible to see in fig 2 coherently the mean distance from the starting point home or work is about 500 meters when the participants were asked the most common mean of transport used to go to the green areas the majority commented by walk 58 75 whereas 18 61 by public transports 13 89 by car and 8 75 by bike since the aim of the research is mainly focused on supporting the definition of coherent and strategic scenarios for the implementation of a new urban park in the downgraded area of basse di stura the survey also investigated the frequency of visit of the urban parks in the city table a 2 in appendix a this analysis allows to understand if there are some competitors in terms of proximity and substitution of the future park of basse di stura 5 2 econometric analysis as mentioned above this experiment is based on the hypothesis commonly accepted that green areas exert a gravitational effect on the residents living in their immediate proximity and that this decreases with increasing distance planning a new green area must therefore consider current preferences related to the use of urban parks this is the reason why the experiment takes into account the correlation between the choice and preferences related to the new park sp and the existent green areas that are represented by the travel costs and visit frequency to the preferred park at the moment of the interview rp the choice experiment concerning the new park must therefore be combined with the current preferences characterizing the interviewee this leads to a mixed structure where the error terms must be evaluated separately in this case rpl similar to the random coefficients model for linear regressions can be helpful table 5 shows the results of the reduced model where only the variables with acceptable significance of the estimated parameters are included considering that each respondent i e 369 answered 4 choice sets the total number of observations amounted to 1476 out of about twenty attributes services proposed to the interviewee in the choice sets see section 4 2 only six have a positive coefficient in order of importance educational tour rural lands research center play areas bounded for dogs or assigned to children and horses farm considering the initial groups of activities facilities presented in the questionnaire social educational natural technological sport and organized activities at least one type per group was identified by means of this analysis there are also three undesirable features the roller skating rinks the beach along the river and the study area which show a negative sign from the users standpoint the city of turin has many facilities organized for sport and probably there is no need to allocate an area with such environmental characteristics to this type of activity evidently the presence of a study area also does not seem coherent the constant for the specific alternative that in this case of a binary choice model represents the preferred green area at the interview moment has a significant but negative coefficient this result reveals in general a preference for the new park project or even better the possibility of commuting one s choice if certain activities or services are included in the new project the single mrss represents the opportunity costs to switch the visit from the actual park to the new one containing these different activities and facilities consistent with the general layout of the model travel cost and visit frequency have a correct sign and good significance level the standard deviations of the random parameters are also significant these results validate both the tcm assumptions and the expectations of the rpl model finally table 6 shows the estimate for the entire city of turin of the mean of the access cost to green areas independently of their different characteristics and distances recalling that urban parks are a public good whose access is not regulated these estimates represent useful monetary indicators for valuing the benefits costs if one proceeds toward a project s feasibility study these results could also guide the municipality choices which can propose for example the realization of cultivated rural lands combined with education and horse farms or the organization of the area as a cultural center grounded on the research center the educational farm and the educational tours 6 discussion users of green areas do not pay a fee to access them but that does not mean the public good has no economic value for example the maintenance costs in charge to public administration show that conservation is at least necessary in this work a valuation of the potential benefits of new green space has been proposed to compare the provision costs and benefits that would be gained the model joins an approach based on rp with dce where consumers preferences are hypothetical the latter is however influenced by the distances between the respondent s home and the new park not all types of activities services presented here were great results services such as the butterfly house or the beach do not seem to meet great interest while more replaceable and widespread activities appear more familiar and attractive or irreplaceable as for example children and dogs areas this may be trivial less obvious are the general results which nonetheless provide some important indications to the policy makers the estimation of tmrs provides the following values the inclusion of the various services offered increases the benefit in a range that goes from 3 64 to 7 33 per user the calculation of the overall annual benefits is in these cases strongly influenced by the number of actual and potential users this number is not easily identifiable which is why residents can be considered as total beneficiaries taking into account that urban planning standard is calculated as the square meters of green areas per residents in 2019 9 700 000 were spent in the city of turin on the maintenance of urban green areas città di torino 2021 an amount well above the present recreational use benefits just calculated equal to 4 707 254 per year for a population of 858 205 residents in 2021 however if the park will contain no unique features such as a dog area or a play area for children the recreational use benefit is lower because the park will gather a smaller catchment area i e the one closest to park in particular the inclusion of these services increases the benefit in an average of 4 485 per user and the population catched is equal to 8 917 residents living inside the 800 m i e around 10 minutes walk from the park this produce a total recreational benefit equal to 39 993 per year additionally considering that the services provided by ugis include various ecosystem functions this estimate must be considered only as a wtp for recreational use 7 conclusions this study proposes an innovative integration of rp and sp methods for supporting the public administration in considering citizens preferences to design of a new urban park in north western italy this methodology can be replicated in different areas and with other planning and management purposes to support public bodies in orienting their resources and providing efficient policies and strategies these main objectives are pursued by the application of this methodology identyfing the preferred project features and valuing the actual recreational value considering a preference for the new park versus the existent ugis from the results the following conclusions and implications were reached first the study indicates that a larger percentage of the sampled population while remaining conditioned by the nearest location of the current green areas shows an interest in the new park but this also implies that most of the population has access to the nearest parks and derives the greatest benefit this means that residents have thought the new park will improve their actual level of utility to the extent that certain activities or services are included or excluded from the project considering the high standard of green areas per inhabitant in turin which means high maintenance costs officials and agencies responsible for formulating policies and developing programs to deliver and manage ugis should focus on improving the quality and not just the quantity of urban green areas secondly the study has also revealed the preferences for certain project features of the future park the favorite activities for basse di stura park are the educational tour horses farm cultivated lands research center and play areas assigned to children or bounded for dogs this result suggests that some new facilities are preferred together with those already present in the existent green areas the consequence is that urban planners and municipal green management must adopt programs related to the provision of green areas to the specific choices of the population to avoid wasting scarce economic resources a second consideration must be made regarding a bottom up investment planning process in this case it seems necessary to investigate the preferences and needs of the population and the final design of ugis should also be informed by other considerations such as cost location and accessibility in other words it is only by looking at the demand side of this type of services that supply can be optimized by improving the overall well being and quality of urban life finally it should be noted that the use of a mixed model based on rp and sp has helped to avoid some typical biases of the environmental value elicitation process using sp such as for example the cvm contingent valuation method conversely it cannot eliminate the issues associated with sample surveys the size and representativeness of the sample unfortunately representative sample surveys of the entire city population would be particularly burdensome for the municipality and are seldom implemented this would be added to the high costs of providing and maintaining green areas this experiment wants to be a small contribution even if not perfectly exhaustive and definitive indeed a limitation of this work lies in the fact that the sample is not perfectly representative of the statistical characteristics of the whole population the resulting sample based on an in situ approach was designed to cover all the urban parks in turin and the 34 districts of the city but it has produced a larger proportion of young people with high education a future improvement of the work will certainly develop a probability sample with the aim to represent every member of the population also those less interested in park use and visit and verify the differences with the current analysis moreover the survey was developed immediately after the covid 19 pandemic this could have produced a distorting effect on the uses and habits of urban parks the administration of the questionnaire in a subsequent period could correct some distortions due to the extraordinary event lived between 2019 and 2022 worldwide and in particular in italy

24154,competition for resources among trees shrubs and weeds in forest plantations is an important factor that directly interferes with the growth and production of forests understanding the ways in which plantation trees compete for resources during their development helps to more accurately estimate tree growth and wood production in models growth and production models are classified as empirical or process based models for both types of models competition is added either directly as a numerical variable or indirectly through submodels that quantify the use of available resources for growth among plants the first part of this article is a contextualization of how competition is embedded in empirical g ym and process based pbm growth and production models the second part is a systematic review between the years 1999 2021 that seeks to answer the questions which species in brazil has the highest number of publications on competition in g ym and pbm which competition assessment methods are used in studies on g ym and pbm in pinus and eucalyptus plantations in brazil what were the advances in studies on competition in g ym and pbm in pinus and eucalyptus plantations the largest number of articles published during the period studied was in eucalyptus plantations which is because there is a larger area of these plantations in brazil compared to pinus plantations the review showed that competition in most articles is treated indirectly using basal area number of trees density and beer lambert law competition is a complex process to assess however not neglected by the models the contrary studies have advanced and shown direct ways to competition by incorporating processes and indices in either g ym and pbm keywords systematic review tree competition growth and yield models individual tree modelling data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction general ecological theory typically divides competition into resource competition and interference competition resource competition also called exploitation competition occurs when two species compete for space light water and nutrients so that one neighbor s consumption of a resource depletes it and makes it unavailable to other plants interference competition occurs when there is direct interference by a neighbor preventing the other weaker individual from having access to a vital resource either through physical aggression or the production of toxic substances which may cause the competitor s extinction it is safe to argue that with plants most of the competition is resource competition but there may be certain cases of interference competition through chemical interactions or physical contact keddy 2017 water light and nutrients are the three main classes of resources limiting plant growth and are considered resources for which individual plants compete the study of resource competition in all its forms is complex due to the unique characteristics of each resource craine and dybzinski 2013 the complexity of competition requires different perspectives for explaining this process and it is examined by its intensity importance effect response and outcome clearly depending on the objective connolly et al 2001 gibson et al 1999 the intensity of competition is defined as the amount that competition reduces the condition of an individual from the ideal while the importance of competition is the degree to which competition contributes to the overall decrease in fitness relative to other processes that affect plant growth keddy 2017 weigelt and jolliffe 2003 however what ecologists typically observe are actually the effects of competition i e reduced plant growth due to the stress of sharing limited resources in its vicinity begon et al 2006 in general it is understood that competition is competition between neighboring individuals for environmental resources light water nutrients and the efficiency with which these resources are used to support growth binkley et al 2010 fernández tschieder and binkley 2018a harper 1982 schwinning and weiner 1998 tilman 1989 vospernik et al 2015 growth and yield models are essential to improve forest management decision making these models are classified as empirical g ym and based processes pbm eg photosynthesis transpiration and respiration despite the importance of understanding competition in planted forests most studies approach competition in growth and production models in a generalized way examining non special measures tree density basal area and intraspecific competition in commercial monoculture plantations e g example cao et al 2021 fadrique et al 2021 vanclay et al 2013 wallraf and wagner 2019 brazil stands out on the international scene for its extensive native tropical forests and the planting of homogeneous forest plantations with exotic species the use of good management practices genetic improvement and soil and climate conditions in the country led to a worldwide recognition of brazil s high productivity potential volume of wood produced per area per year during short intensive rotations in 2020 brazil had average productivity of 36 8 m3 ha per year in eucalyptus plantations while in pine plantations there was an increase in productivity to 31 9 m3 ha ibá 2021 this review aims to identify the advances in quantification methods and competition modeling that serve to improve the growth and production models and based on processes models in brazil first we present an overview of the concept and definition of competition and then describe its use in forest growth and yield models next we analyze the major studies between 1999 and 2021 that have used the concepts of competition and quantified in two classes of growth and yield models empirical and process based models in brazil for pine and eucalypt plantations 2 definitions of competition although many physiological mechanisms are involved in resource capture they are not directly considered in the understanding of resource competition thus competition is often defined in terms of the effects caused on plants and not of the physiological mechanisms that lead plants to experience competition grime 1979 since knowledge of the latter is not always clear as an example a tree shows reduced growth because it suffers crown shading caused by a neighboring tree other genetic and physiological characteristics certainly contribute to this reduction but are not addressed as direct results of competition when evaluating the effect of competition on plant development three main processes need to be considered competition competitive reduction and facilitation kelty 1992 lambers and oliveira 2019 vandermeer 1989 competition occurs when two or more plants or populations interact to impair the growth or cause the death of the other lambers et al 2008 vandermeer 1989 competitive reduction also known as complementarity occurs when the interspecific competition is less than the intraspecific competition kelty 1992 lambers et al 2008 lambers and oliveira 2019 vandermeer 1989 i e when species experience less interspecific than intraspecific competition facilitation occurs when a species has a positive effect on another lambers and oliveira 2019 loreau and hector 2001 vandermeer 1989 and it can occur at the same time as competition perry et al 2008 the definitions of competition in table 1 help to understand the processes that influence tree growth resource sharing and forest stand productivity tree growth is the result of different competition situations so caution must be exercised when relating competition to tree size and growth fernández tschieder and binkley 2018a also the symmetry or asymmetry of tree competition is influenced by other variables such as age type of stand structure stand density climatic variables and edaphic characteristics forrester 2019 2 1 use of competition in growth and yield modeling 2 1 1 empirical growth and yield models g ym forest productivity is estimated by forest growth and yield models where competition is represented by equations variables or indices these models are grouped into four categories empirical models process based models hybrid models and gap models fontes et al 2011 pretzsch et al 2015a weiskittel et al 2011 the main objective of empirical models is to predict the state of forest development and yield over time process based models represent essential physiological processes e g light interception photosynthesis usually to understand and explore the system which are then combined to characterize tree and stand development hybrid models merge resources from empirical and process based models and are used for both understanding and prediction gap models are designed to explore long term ecological processes usually to understand the interactions that control forest species succession weiskittel et al 2011 the models are also classified according to spatial resolution into stand level or individual tree level for some process based models the spatial resolution can be even more detailed going down to the level of an individual leaf within a tree crown in while in empirical models the fitting can also be performed by size class or diameter burkhart and tomé 2012 studies on competition in brazil began with researchers concern with studying the numerous influences of ecology and silvicultural treatments on forest development with the objective of promoting an increase in quantitative and qualitative forest stand yield many of these studies have focused on the relationships between environmental factors and silvicultural treatments especially those that affect stand density growth and yield schneider et al 1992 the market demand for biological products has expanded eucalyptus plantations to dry regions where changes in silvicultural regimes such as reducing the number of trees planted per hectare can reduce tree mortality mitigating the competition for water resources hakamada et al 2017 scolforo et al 2019 early studies on the growth and yield of pine and eucalypt forests were conducted using empirical models and expressed the effects of competition indirectly with the inclusion of the basal area and the number of trees campos 1980 oliveira et al 1991 that is at a stand scale resolution these studies did not focus on quantifying or discussing the effects of competition they only included density variables to better explain and estimate growth and yield measures such as forest density are directly related to competition providing a basis for the management of tree plantations since forest density includes the area used by the trees forest density can be expressed in absolute or relative terms such as in basal area diameter at 1 30 m above the ground π 4 or number of individuals per unit area number of trees hectare or acre the most used in growth and yield models vanclay et al 2013 the individual cultivation area of a tree is defined mainly in monocultures by the ideal cultivation space the space between trees being ideal for them to reach greater growth potential with less competition economically viable and operational therefore at the beginning of silviculture in brazil many tests were performed to determine the best planting spacing e g berenhause 1971 rensi coelho et al 1970 the best spacing is that which is ideal to control the competition for water light and nutrients between the trees maximizing the growth wood density and individual production of each tree studies on stand density have become increasingly necessary and justified to accompany the remarkable evolution in forest management techniques in recent times binkley et al 2020 stape and binkley 2010 another way to represent forest density is indices that relate different dendrometric variables in equations such as the stand density index sdi kimsey et al 2019 reineke 1933 relative spacing index s burkhart 2013 and yoda s self thinning rule condés et al 2017 yoda et al 1963 these indices can identify when competition arises in the forest for thinning to be performed the sdi expresses the stand density using the quadratic mean diameter dg and the number of trees per hectare n that have a diameter of at least 10 4 inches 25 4 cm the slope and intercept of this linear relationship was originally considered to be independent of age site and species but that is no longer considered to be the case reineke 1933 zhao et al 2020 maximum density models often use site index as a covariate to indicate site quality however it is incapable of identifying which site growth factors define and predict maximum stand density kimsey et al 2019 for this recent studies with a maximum sdi frontier model developed models adding variables of stand characteristics tree size species mixing and geographic latitude longitude topographic elevation aspect climatic derivatives of temperature and precipitation and soil site characteristics kimsey et al 2019 yang and burkhart 2017 define the maximum size density ratio as a limit or maximum trade off between the number of trees per unit area and the average size of trees that can be sustained in each stand to obtain this information authors using the reineke density model the competition rule and kira density and nilson index these measures were also used to locate maximum implicit areas of the stand kira s density rule is a logistical form that describes tree competition and thinning behavior chiou et al 2020 kira et al 1953 shinozaki e kira 1956 tadaki 1963 vospernik et al 2015 at a given height of dominant tree the root mean square diameter dg increases with decreasing number of trees per unit area the nilson index concentrates on the mean distance between trees with a linear relationship between the sparseness of the stand l and the mean square diameter dg yang and burkhart 2017 hart becking relative spacing index s or rs is based on the theory that a tree of a given size should have enough space for the development of its crown diameter becking 1953 hart 1928 this index is calculated as the ratio between the mean space of the trees and the dominant stand height assmann 1970 castaño santamaría et al 2021 tartarino et al 2020 s ms hd 100 where s relative spacing index ms mean spacing between trees in meters and hd assmann dominant height in meters the rs has been incorporated in prediction models and development area design for the development of development projects and which is useful in programming stand development projects and which is useful in programming thinning development projects yang and burkhart 2017 evaluated two approaches for estimating basal area with rs the first they was estimated directly by a non linear model of the basal area of the people with rs as an independent variable and in the second s was defined as the ratio between the distance between trees and d d letting rsd be a function of stand age the model of the base area of the stand rs offers a simple and safe way to estimate the occupation of the stand rsd were positively correlated while dispersion and points both s and rsd decreased with the development of the stand therefore in new stands the s estimated by the rsd would be less than accurate than for older stands however as stands develop and approach the lower asymptote the rsd becomes a more reliable measure of s than stands the self thinning rule defined by yoda et al 1963 and propagated by tang et al 1994 determines the average tree weight over the number of surviving trees of a mean diameter logarithmic scale which results in a linear relationship with a common power of 3 2 liu and pennings 2019 mrad et al 2020 when self thinning occurs the equation is w kn 3 2 where w is the mean tree size weight volume height basal area etc n the number of trees per hectare and k a constant considered a measure of the rate required to sustain the established crown area which varies with the crown condition yoda et al 1963 vanclay and sand 2009 studying self thinning of eucalyptus pilularis in queensland examined the complete trajectory of the average stand diameter over a range of densities the trajectory that has a value close to zero in stands with low densities and that increases and approaches of a limiting slope s as the density increases raphaël trouvé et al 2017 addressed a mortality model framework that predicts survival trajectories that follow a line of self thinning they used generalized linear poisson and negative binomial models for count data as well as a nonlinear least squares procedure on the integrated scale to calibrate the mortality model the method increases the possibility of quantifying how environmental factors influence the dynamic equilibrium of self thinning the indices of density effects on self thinning and maximum size density relationships in monospecific forests of uniform age are useful simplifications of stand level allometry that have been used in forest growth models to predict density dependent mortality burkhart and tomé 2012 härkönen et al 2019 forrester et al 2021 for example formit m forest management strategies to enhance the mitigation potential of european forests is a hybrid model that combines process based components standard forest inventory data and climate scenarios among the equations that exist in this model sdi equations are used to estimate the density of the stand and it is also applied in a equation together with the volume to define the new mean diameter competition indices are incorporated into growth and yield models at the individual tree level through relatively simple mathematical expressions that capture the primary effects of competition on tree development kuehne et al 2020 the effect that a neighbor can have on the individual growth of a tree is expressed by the extent to which each tree is affected by its neighbors burkhart and tomé 2012 competition indices are classified into three classes distance dependent distance independent and semi distance dependent ledermann 2010 stage and ledermann 2008 the distance independent class is characterized by using only information on tree size related to a stand density factor the distance dependent indices incorporate the relative locations of neighboring trees ishihara et al 2016 ledermann 2010 moreno et al 2017 semi distance dependent indices were proposed by stage and lerdman 2008 and were developed for circular plots they make it possible to use the basal area factor of the bitterlich sampling but are restricted to a smaller set of neighboring trees i e only those near each other rather than all trees in the sampling unit hui et al 2018 martins et al 2011 among the predictors of competition between individual trees the four most important are the density of competitors the sizes of competitors the distances between the target tree and competitors and the relative locations of competitors pukkala 1989 radtke et al 2003 to date more than 50 types of competition indices have been developed based on those four aspects weigelt and jolliffe 2003 but most of the indices used in growth and yield models are intensity indices i e they quantify the competition that reduces the condition of an individual tree below the ideal these indexes are a long term integration of all competition and complementarity processes table 2 shows some competition indices in the literature forest biometricians continue to develop simple and effective indices of competition that affect mortality in forested areas sharma et al 2002 c l vanderschaaf and burkhart 2007 c l vanderschaaf and burkhart 2007 zeide 2005 the individual tree model although seldom used in brazil martins et al 2011 has often been used in europe the united states canada africa and australia gonzález et al 2006 mabvurira and miina 2002 monty et al 2008 vospernik 2021 the rarer use of these models in brazil is related to variables the distance and crown variables are not commonly measured in inventories other indices that assess planting uniformity size inequality conditions the size hierarchy between individual trees are also important in assessing competition the gini index which originated in production ecology and ecological literature has been used to assess size hierarchy and asymmetric competition in forests however this index is not included in the classification of competition indices distance dependent independent and semi dependent the gini index applied to forests can be graphically very simple areas it is equal to twice the area between the curve representing a cumulative basal area as a function of the cumulative relative value number called the lorenz curve and the straight line the greater the size inequality between individuals the more concave is the lorenz curvature and the greater the gini index cordonnier and kunstler 2015 fernández tschieder and binkley 2018b this index 1 is continuous restricted within the interval 0 1 that is 0 when plants in a forest have exactly the same basal area and approaches at most 1 as the population moves toward a large tree another fact is that its value does not change when the basal area of each tree is multiplied by the same scalar property homogeneity property cordonnier and kunstler 2015 fernández tschieder and binkley 2018 1 g i n i 2 i 1 n i g i n g n 1 n where igi is the basal area of tree i trees are sorted in ascending order n trees number g total basal area gini and size inequality can be positively or negatively correlated with population growth which makes them difficult to use in correlative models due to the variable shape of the pattern ranging from positive neutral to negative gini relations and because they seem to be indicating no specific process except for automatic processes as the result of thinning on size inequality forrester 2019 this makes gini or other inequality indices calculated from tree size as opposed to growth different from many other variables in empirical models because most of the other variables that form the basis for such models produce consistent patterns growth usually increases with stocking density and site indices growth always increases with age to a peak and then starts to decline etc but growth can increase decrease or not change with gini the uniformity of the stand is an alternative to assess the degree of intra specific competition that begins soon after the canopy is closed since the unevenness of planting indicates increased competition less efficient use of resources and reduced productivity binkley 2004 landsberg j sands 2011 ryan et al 2010 stape et al 2006 proposed a uniformity index called pvar50 defined as the accumulated percentage of the dendrometric variable in 50 of the smallest trees planted including planting failures this index was widespread in brazil as pv50 calculated by ordering the trees in the plot from the smallest to the largest tree in individual volume 2 and used to assess survival in initial plantations and to assess the behavior of uniformity in productivity during rotation 2 p v 50 k 1 n 2 v i j k 1 n v i j 100 where v individual volume off plot i in age j n number of trees planted in order from smallest to largest the range between the diameters in the 63rd and 10th percentile used for the adjustment of a distribution and probability function can be considered as representative of the homogeneity of the stand mctague and bailey 1987 these diameters provide an idea of the diameter distribution of the stand and allow us to analyze that a narrower and higher diameter distribution curve indicates a more homogeneous stand with a higher rate of tree growth conversely when the diameter distribution curve is wider and flatter the inequality between trees increases due to the suppression of larger trees over smaller trees then the smaller the diametric range of the plot the higher the uniformity index mctague and bailey 1987 scolforo et al 2019 however this is an index that is rarely used but it is easy to apply as it only uses the diameter variable 3 3 i u j k c m 1 1 d a p p 63 j k d a p p 10 j k where d b h p 63 j k dbh cm at the 63rd percentile of the jthplot d a p p 10 j k dbh cm at the 63rd percentile of the jth plot 2 1 2 competition in process based models pbm process based models pbms differ from empirical models because they aim to represent physiological processes that influence growth rather than developing empirical models that may not have a cause and effect relationship they are therefore often used to evaluate the effect of changing environmental conditions on forest growth pretzsch 2014 weiskittel et al 2011 their use and application have increased in recent years due to the need to consider productivity under climate change becoming an important tool to support adaptive forest management and planning garcia gonzalo et al 2014 these growth and yield models vary in their degree of complexity data used construction and spatial temporal resolution process based to project reliable estimates of forest growth the model parameters need to be calibrated and the estimates need to be validated against observed data using both physical drivers soil and climate and tree growth measurements palma et al 2018 restrepo et al 2022 the main physiological processes considered in process based models are light interception photosynthesis stomatal conductance respiration carbon allocation mortality and water and nutrient dynamics in the soil like empirical models there are a variety of process based models including

of these models have the direct objective of evaluating or representing competition in most models at the stand scale competition is partly addressed as in empirical models including a density factor such as basal area and number of trees per hectare weiskittel et al 2010 however competition is also represented in the reduction in net photosynthesis as the leaf area index lai increases based on a empirical relationship with the canopy though this does not fully explain the competitive position of the tree within the stand where light interception is mediated by the crown attributes of an individual tree therefore in process based models light interception is estimated by applying the beer lambert law after accounting for the effects of incomplete canopy closure on the sunlit and shaded portions weiskittel et al 2010 according to the beer lambert law 4 vertical transmittance through the forest canopy can be written as 4 τ i exp κ p a i i where p a i i is the cumulative pai

ecophysiological models used to understand the biogeochemical cycles of carbon water and nitrogen at the stand level running and coughlan 1988 over time the model has undergone modifications and is currently used to estimate individual tree growth tree bgc korol et al 1991 in several biomes worldwide biome bgc white et al 2000 the introduction of the individual tree scale in the forest bgc model occurred with the inclusion of competition korol et al 1995 the proposal was to determine the gross primary productivity at the stand level using the forest bgc approach and then allocate this total to individual trees based on the competition between trees algorithm the competition algorithm incorporates both the light intensity under which the tree grows and the ability of the leaves to photosynthesize due to the light intensity direct and diffuse photosynthetically active radiation par is initially simulated and then allocated to groups of trees with similar heights leading to a significant improvement in the proportional allocation based on the leaf area of the trees korol et al 1995 apsim mccown et al 1996 is a software system has been specifically designed to facilitate cross disciplinary simulation based research apsim can model forest production and apsim can model forest production and is used extensively to assess agricultural management practices risk climate change adaptation strategies mixed pasture livestock strategies nutrient leaching under various conditions genetics of features and has been used to investigate the holzworth et al 2014 agroforestry resource competition for light and soil resources of intercropped plant species and also to investigate the effects shelter using traditional single point simulation methods huth et al 2002 carberry et al 2002 an updated description of the apsim model is provided by holzworth et al 2014 the effect of crop competition on another is simulated by its influence on the level of stocks flows of resources provided by the radiation water and nitrogen modules the absence of any direct communication between culture modules in apsim is the main versatility in modeling competition between species keating et al 2003 the modules within apsim growth are essentially point based models that represent the behavior of the system at some single point in space mccown et al 1996 huth et al 2001 this model functionality allowed huth et al 2001 simulate discrete points within the zone of influence of a windbreak in this case the simulated state of the trees within the windbreak is used to alter the belowground competition and the microclimatic effects of the windbreak at various distances from the trees the use of resources by the trees from the ground in the paddock feeds back into the tree productivity calculations the apsim growth model calculates daily biomass production from intercepted solar radiation and radiation use efficiency which is affected by soil and climatic factors interception of solar radiation is calculated assuming an exponential decay of light within a canopy huth et al 2001 elli et al 2019 the apsim model basic does not present the variable stem volume as an output this model presents only the variable stem dry matter excluding branches elli et al 2019 thus elli et al 2019 used the wood density function proposed by sands and landsberg 2002 to obtain the wood density curve by age and calculate the volume of the tree the apsim model has been modernized and enhanced called apsim next generation for the competition between forest trees its gain was significant as it incorporated new technologies and modeling approaches that allowed for more precise and detailed simulation of competition for resources such as nutrients and sunlight among trees the model also considers the heterogeneity of the environment including variations in topography soil and climate which can influence the competition among trees a detailed description of the updates the model underwent is described by holzworth et al 2018 apsim next generation eucalyptus model was developed and calibrated to simulate the growth of eucalyptus grandis and hybrids with or from e globulus and e urophyylla in brazil and australia and presented aboveground biomass and components as an output option in addition to including more types of plants beyond the main interest in the case of eucalyptus or other types of trees this capability allows simulating a competition between the trees and one or more other plants smethurst et al 2020 the model cabala was created to provide silvicultural decision support for forest managers this model links carbon water and nitrogen flows through the atmosphere trees and soil including soil organic matter this strong linkage between stand biomass allocation and external environmental conditions make this model suitable for exploring stand management options and the effects of factors such as frost and drought on growth battaglia et al 2004 3 pg is a type of stand scale model that integrates empirical forest measurement data from conventional growth and yield models with carbon balance models based on physiological processes sands and landsberg 2002 therefore it is often classified as a hybrid model weiskittel et al 2011 since the initial publication of 3 pg landsberg and waring 1997 several modifications have been made and the way in which the relationships between the parameters are represented has evolved to make the parameters more intuitively significant sands and landsberg 2002 competition is indirectly represented in the 3 pg mortality submodel which is density dependent using the 3 2 self thinning rule bryars et al 2013 drew and flewelling 1977 sands and landsberg 2002 for this purpose the stand basal area is included which is calculated from the diameter at breast height and tree density gupta and sharma 2019 because the 3 pg model was designed for single species stands its original formulation does not allow estimations of interspecific competition with understory plants wei et al 2014 however in studies in northern california usa some new resources were applied through 3 pg to evaluate competition between woody shrubs and young pinus ponderosa stands to simulate the impact of competition of these woody shrubs on tree growth the growth dynamics of the shrubs and subsequently the interaction between shrubs and pines were determined with this two new functions were added to 3 pg to estimate the lai of shrubs ls adding only three new parameters to the model the first function estimates the amount of light that passes through the canopy without limitation where ls is a fixed ratio kl and the second is the phase in which the light becomes a limiting factor estimated by beer s law wei et al 2014 the new version of the 3 pg model was 3 pgmix developed for mixed forests by adjusting sub models using soil water balances and different allometric equations the 3 pgmix provides new insights into forecasting the growth dynamics in forests that have more than one species forrester and tang 2016 there is an r package of the model forrester and tang 2016 which is based on a version of 3 pg for mixed species stands and uneven aged stands the model was used to assess the effects of climate change on the growth of mixed forests in switzerland simulating competition for light and water between different species or between different size age cohorts it also simulates vertical gradients of radiation vpd etc within the canopy and considers the time of leaf fall or budding eg deciduous species the interactions between species or size classes are included directly and are not restricted to an overstory understory interaction because the other 3 pg version also allows species to be mixed within the same canopy layer forrester et al 2021b the 3 pg is among the pbm that has been more applied by companies and in an operational way than the other models mentioned above recent studies combine empirical growth tables or models and pbms to explore the strengths of empirical models that is predictive ability and parsimony in the calibration data and pbms i e sensitivity to changes in environmental conditions in a unified hybrid modeling approach fontes et al 2011 the study using the pbm 4c lasch born et al 2020 which illustrated the benefits of this hybrid approach to evaluate future biomass stocks and different management strategies in europe in brazil almeida et al 2003 demonstrated the possibility of integrating the process based model 3 pg with the empirical growth model called e grow arcel the two models have been linked to allow the prediction of forest productivity and wood products under different environmental conditions the link is based on the mai at age 6 years mai6 there is a robust relationship between mai6 and si stand indice defined to be the mean dominant height at age 5 years derived from e grow arcel once 3 pg has provided the mai6 values this empirical relationship estimates the si that is applied in e grow arcel to predict growth and yield at stand structure and product profile levels almeida et al 2003 g day comins and mcmurtrie 1993 medlyn et al 2000 is a stand scale model that simulates the major fluxes of carbon water and nitrogen between the atmosphere soil and plant the main ecophysiological processes are represented by simple submodels of c assimilation water and n uptake plant respiration c and n allocation to the growth of different plant compartments litterfall soil organic matter decomposition and evapotranspiration halliday et al 2003 kirschbaum et al 2001 g day like 3 pg has no specific formula to quantify competition but rather addresses competition indirectly by predicting tree growth above and below ground based on the model of mcmurtrie and wolf 1983 g day considers the competition for light water and other nutrients between a canopy of trees and grass species corbeels et al 2005a corbeels et al 2005b the model slcd was designed to simulate foliage renewal and estimate monthly changes of leaf area in response to climate variations from sparse measurements of foliage area and biomass this model was designed for use in a coupling of models combining the advantages of growth yield models and pbms at the stand level in the brazilian eucalypt forest the leaf area index and litterfall were globally predicted with good accuracy and may be improved by using complementary validation data and introducing the influence of climate and nutrients on leaf traits sainte marie et al 2014 architectural models and three dimensional models are widely used to evaluate competition for light the maestra model is a three dimensional process based model that uses calculations of radiation transfer and leaf physiology to calculate radiation absorption photosynthesis and transpiration by trees growing individually or in a population medlyn 2004 wang and jarvis 1990 this model is continuously improved by the scientific community and when coupled with a soil water balance and plant hydraulic model that is based on the spa model of mathew williams williams et al 1996 a model of canopy radiation absorption photosynthesis and water balance called maespa results duursma and medlyn 2012 maestra evaluates intra or interspecific competition for light and the new version called maespa duursma et al 2012 can evaluate the competition for water the model calculates the absorbed par individually as a function of the position of the tree in the stand analyzing the limitations imposed by the shading or not by neighboring trees thus the 3d approach and the geometric representation of the model are important to calculate and simulate light interception and it also takes into account the crown size and position leaf area density distribution leaf angle distribution and the differences in these variables between plants the spatial scale of the maestra spa model can be hourly daily or monthly this information can be at the individual tree level duursma and medlyn 2012 process based resource use efficiency approaches provide dynamic estimates of resource availability at the stand and individual levels as well as a structure for their use based on tree physiology this is important to obtain consistency between resource availability at the stand level and the success of an individual tree in resource competition weiskittel et al 2010 the growth of individual trees depends on the efficiency with which resources water light and nutrients are used to fix carbon for biomass production and competition is explained by the division of these resources between individuals some models such as maespa balance and cabala can simulate the air temperature par rainfall tree phenology and photosynthesis of a stand or individual trees pretzsch et al 2015b purves et al 2007 and ogle and pacala 2009 also addressing the question of the scalability of competition between trees in a process based structure recently demonstrated the usefulness of assuming perfect plasticity of tree crowns in the stand canopy fourcaud et al 2007 highlighted the growing importance of vegetation structure and plant architecture in modeling plant growth growth and production models in addition to monocultures are also important in agroforestry systems in recent years agroforestry systems have been widely implemented due to their economic social and ecological importance with skills in reducing hunger better use by reducing degraded areas and mitigating climate change gomes et al 2020 in this type of system intraspecific competition may be the best assessment of pmb in this type of system spatial configuration refers to the positions of trees in relation to crops within a plot which can be mixed with various levels of intimacy and patterns or separated sinclair 1999 where trees and crops are closely intermingled the spatial configuration horizontally and vertically and above and below ground influences resource capture and competition for resources between components several agroforestry models have already been presented and some that present the competition representation are wanulcas van noordwijk and lusiana 1999 hi safe and yield safe dupraz et al 2005 graves et al 2007 and palma et al 2014 in wanulcas competition is described by first calculating the uptake potential of the combined root systems mycorrhizal hyphae of all plants in all cells layer by zone using a zero uptake model of maximizing water and nutrient uptake and then second introducing expected downregulation at each plant based on its overall supply demand ratio on a given day holzworth et al 2014 the sequence in which walks are applied in such models first tree first harvest or alternating matters a problem avoided in wanulcas hi safe and yield safe utilize water competition between plant components and are managed at the voxel scale based on plant and voxel potentials enabling dynamic water revenue in 3d heterogeneous soil holzworth et al 2014 there is still a lack of sufficiently modular freely accessible and reusable simulation frameworks where tree growth crop growth and components responsible for species competition can be developed by others than the research group original research kraft et al 2021 a list of models that can be used in agroforestry can be found in the study of kraft et al 2021 currently apsim features a framework that focuses on field scale crops and pastures but has the ability to reuse or interoperate with existing models including tree livestock and landscape models uses intuitive and relatively easy to measure parameters and allows analysis of scenarios that may include economy on an agricultural scale luedeling et al 2016 the ability to simulate crop growth in response to competition for solar radiation shading is one of the capabilities of this model that offers the opportunity to simulate agricultural production under the canopy of trees dufour et al 2013 apsim has been used in the modeling of agroforests all over the world with different goals for example is in the comparison of economic viability of the consortium between gliricidia and maize in dry lands of east africa where the consortium productivity was evaluated by the apsim model swamila et al 2021 in ethiopia using the apsim agroforestry model simulations indicated that pruning and fertilization of trees have the potential to increase maize productivity by enhancing light water and nitrogen availability to understory crops dilla et al 2020 smethurst et al 2020 showed that the apsim next generation model applied in eucalyptus studies in 12 locations three in australia and nine in brazil with a wide variety of climate soil and forest can accurately predict the growth of trees and their attributes under different soil and management conditions indicating its potential use in forest plantations to complement existing models the flexibility and openness of the apsim platform also make it a suitable choice for operational and research purposes 3 systematic review structure and methods we conducted a literature search following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses prisma guidelines for systematic moher et al 2009 prisma statement which consists of a identification of records b record screening c article assessment for eligibility and d inclusion of the eligible studies fig 1 this process was accomplished utilizing the software mendeley desktop 1 19 4 and publish or perish pop software https harzing com resources publish or perish harzing 2007 initially focusing on studies that reported competition in pine and eucalypt plantations in brazil because competition is a generic term used in several fields we limited the search to empirical and process based growth and yield models this part of the article aims to answer the following question which species has the highest number of publications on competition in g ym and pbm which competition assessment methods are used in studies on g ym and pbm in pinus and eucalyptus plantations in brazil what were the advances in studies on competition in g ym and pbm in pinus and eucalyptus plantations we searched for peer reviewed articles published between 1999 and 2021 in the web of science scopus and science direct databases using the following keywords title abs key competition and pinus or eucalyptus and process based or ecophysiological or growth and yield and brazil or brasil and not pastures or animal with the exception of the search in the scopus database in which we removed the words and brazil or brasil because no results were returned and used the filter limit to affilcountry brazil we only included articles published in journals indexed in journal citation reports in 2021 and excluded reviews theses institutional dossiers and technical reports the first search resulted in 376 publications in addition five relevant articles recommended by an expert in this area was added which dropped to 127 after filtering out irrelevant studies screening process that is those that did not fall under the focus of the review but that contained the keywords by coincidence the selected articles were read in full and 53 articles that did not meet the following inclusion criteria were excluded eligibility i contained variables that directly or indirectly related to competition 2 presented growth and yield modeling and 3 used empirical or process based models the studies included are in supplementary materials for keywords co occurrences network analysis we used the ris file extracted from mendeley and imported it into the vos viewer 1 6 9 software vosviewer is a free software tool which is used for creating maps based on network data it also helps in visualizing and exploring these maps 4 results and discussion to answer the objective question of this part of the study this section is organized into two subsections described as follows in subsection 4 1 the quantitative results of the search are addressed with an overview of the studies that were included in the analysis subsection 4 2 presents a content analysis based on the results and discussions of the studies relating to how competition was addressed in growth and yield models empirical g ym and process based pbm in pinus and eucalyptus stands in brazil 4 1 overview of studies the literature search included 73 studies 60 on the genus eucalyptus and 8 on pinus fig 2 shows the number of studies found on the topic in the 1999 2021 period according to this database the number of studies per year for eucalyptus since 2006 showed an annually increasing frequency for the genus pinus we observed the publication of studies only in the second decade and without increasing frequency except for 2021 and the latter pattern was similar to the pattern of eucalyptus studies in 1999 2005 the classification of studies by model class and spatial resolution table 3 showed that for eucalyptus there was a small predominance of studies with process based models 45 overgrowth and yield models 44 among growth and yield models studies that used stand level models predominated 23 3 followed by the models by diameter class 8 2 and at the individual tree level 3 7 in the process based model group there was a balance in the number of studies that used models at the stand level 26 and individual tree level 19 of the total studies on the genus pinus made up 11 more specifically 9 used growth and yield models in pine 8 at the stand level and 1 at the individual tree level the remainder of studies in pine were studies with process based models at the stand level 1 the reasons for the difference in the number of studies between the genera are due for example to the edaphoclimatic requirements of each species and consequently to the larger planted area in brazil of eucalyptus 7 47 million hectares than pinus 1 7 million hectares numbers in 2020 ibá 2021 advances in the genetic improvement of eucalyptus species in recent years have enabled the availability of specific clones for each climate zone of the country in the genus pinus the genetic improvement of the species of pinus taeda a species belonging to the most planted genus in the country increased the yield levels of forests that today reach 32 m³ ha 1 year 1 but this yield can only be found in the southern region of brazil where the climatic and soil conditions are favorable another reason is the longer rotation time of pinus which is approximately 12 to 15 years while that of eucalyptus is approximately 7 years ibá 2021 these aspects contribute to the greater demand for studies on eucalyptus than pinus fig 3 shows the keywords cooccurrence network determined by the number of articles available in the selected databases web of science scopus and science direct van eck and waltman 2014 each color represents a cluster the larger circles indicate the frequency of occurrence of a keyword and the line between the keywords represents the relationship between them the bolder the line is the closer the proximity between them the mapping of the cooccurrence of the keywords identified the common and relevant terms highlighted in five clusters i the first cluster in red is characterized by terms related to stand level growth and yield models and process based models ii the second cluster in green contains terms associated with process based models and with variables found in the parameterization of the maestra model such as light capture and leaf area iii the third cluster in blue also contains ecophysiology topics but related to water use and climate iv the fourth cluster in yellow concentrates the main study term competition which was generally found in studies related to site index spacing individual tree growth models forest growth and the genus eucalyptus v the last cluster in purple includes the term growth and yield model and relates it to forest productivity as suggested in density probability models and basal area 4 2 approach to competition the selected studies had different methods and addressed competition directly and indirectly the studies applying empirical growth and yield models to pinus and eucalyptus fig 4 tested different modeling methods to calculate forest productivity such as clutter s and buckman s growth models and differential equations but without the objective of analyzing competition competition indices widely applied in empirical growth and yield models at the individual tree level were used less frequently for both genera and the basal area index of stage 1973 bai was used in all such studies we observed that distance independent competition indices were the most used as they are less laborious since they do not take distance into account information that is often neglected in forest inventories however in forest plantations with standardized spacing this information can be obtained without the need for field measurement competition indices were also included for modeling pinus mortality but only in one study in that study the inclusion of three basal area indices was tested the bai of stage 1973 and the index of tomé and burkhart 1989 were tested in two logistic models one exponential model and buchman s model the results showed that the exponential model with the inclusion of the bai was the most appropriate to estimate the regular mortality of the studied population as it showed the lowest error in the three evaluated sites the relative spacing index s was used in a single study with pinus specie to control the established thinning regime characterize the volumetric stock level and help determine the time of occurrence of self thinning and in the preparation of a management diagram a relative spacing index of 36 was obtained at the young age of 5 years for pinus taeda with a dominant height of 8 5 m and a large availability of living space an s value of 17 1 indicated the onset of competition in the population and was found in adulthood at 20 years of age with a dominant height of 21 9 m pigatto schneider et al 2016 the finger and schneider 1999 study that used the relative space index in eucalyptus was the earliest in the selected database and used it to evaluate different thinning intensities and dominant heights according to stand development in modeling growth and production clonal stands of eucalyptus in brazil scolforo et al 2019 incorporated the s index and the variable water deficit in a set of equations for prediction and projection of the basal area this index being an attribute of the stand that explains much of the environmental impact on basal area growth over time as discussed by scolforo et al 2018 eucalypt plantations in brazil are distributed in a climatic and hydric gradient so some works are incorporating climatic variables in growth and production models competition was also addressed indirectly through density variables of the total stand estimates for pinus used the variables basal area and increment in different spacings and it was observed that the maximum cross sectional area production g in 1 m² spacing occurred when competition was high at 7 8 years age of technical rotation according to basal area in brazil however the maximum biomass production volume had not yet been reached but was predicted to occur later pacheco et al 2015 in the study with the genus eucalyptus mortality was used through the number of trees per hectare and higher mortality was found in stands with high densities which can be attributed to the greater competition experienced by the trees at these densities ferraz filho et al 2018 tang s law was observed in three studies with pinus and in only one with eucalyptus to estimate the density of the total stand with different spacings this method allowed the authors to understand intraspecific competition which is an important factor affecting the mean plant size in a population and therefore has been studied to describe the relationship between plant size and population density as well as its evolution in trees over time schneider et al 2015 gini index were observed two in studies of eucalyptus soares et al 2017 used mixed models with the gini coefficient as the response variable to model the development of heterogeneity in eucalyptus stands subjected to different thinning intensities the decrease in the level of heterogeneity as well as in their development through time was greater the more intense the thinning higher density as related to more intense competition has been shown to intensify asymmetric competition in the direction of a greater disproportional growth of the largest trees the modeling of the gini index showed that the more intense the thinning the less heterogeneous the resulting stands will be since more small trees were removed growth dominance was very close to zero at the beginning of each growth period this is consistent with the open environment created by thinning and with trees with little competition allowing them to grow very proportionately to their size in the study by soares et al 2020 a mixed growth dominance model was constructed to investigate the effects of stand age accumulated soil water deficit and stand structural heterogeneity at the beginning of the growing season lagged gini coefficient on growth dominance in stands of eucalypt distributed in a climatic gradient in brazil the negative growth dominance value of very young stands may result if smaller trees partition a greater proportion of their aboveground biomass to build their crowns or gain a competitive position within the canopy while larger but still young trees partition a greater proportion of biomass to the roots the structural heterogeneity of the stand in terms of the gini coefficient decreased until about 25 months and then slowly increased with age the sdi reineke index and gini index were observed only in studies of eucalyptus the sdi and yoda model were evaluated as density models along with the tang model in the same study in that study the authors noted that analyzing the number of trees per hectare by the mean diameter showed a decreasing density gradient the mean diameter increased in the initial development stage of a stand when the trees are still small the available living space is abundant and even excessive which decreases with the growth of the trees this causes an increase in competition between individuals in the population until the population reaches a developmental stage with high competition when the natural mortality of individuals begins characterizing self thinning schneider et al 2015 we observed that the sdi and the self thinning rule are widely used to evaluate management interventions but they were not incorporated into g ym which is a potential for future studies that incorporate density and competition using variables already obtained from inventories the pv50 was observed in two publications in eucalyptus plantations with the objective of available the impact of uniformity in production and to monitor silvicultural quality uniformity indices are widely applied by companies in brazil to monitor silvicultural operations in order to minimize possible failures that may harm the future productivity of forests the results found in the studies by hakamada et al 2015a 2015b showed that the most uniform plantations at early ages had the highest yields and that the pv50 interval of uniformity iou from 37 to 50 in the sample plots can be considered satisfactorily uniform being the results of the importance of forestry that guarantees the homogeneous supply of resources in this sense we see a potential for including information on the competitive state of the forest through the gini index and uniformity indices and the pv50 as a way to combine the quality of forest stands with estimates of forest growth and productivity these indices could be included in two ways i in the individual g ym models as is done with the competition indices and ii generating a hybrid model including in the g ym of the stand adding the indices in models of dominant height for classification of site or prediction of basal area fig 5 shows the studies that used process based models among these only one study was in the genus pinus it compared the growth of different genetic materials of pinus taeda from the usa and brazil at different planting densities although the objective was not to study competition competition was indirectly incorporated through the light use efficiency and crown structure of the genetic materials at different planting densities the authors observed that the increase in the number of trees per hectare increased the volumetric growth per unit of absorbed light and that genetic materials with broad canopies competed aggressively for resources albaugh et al 2018 the studies that applied process based models to eucalyptus most often used the 3 pg model and the maespa maestra or maestro model 3 pg incorporates competition indirectly so the focus of the studies that used this model was to simulate the potential productivity in terms of forest volume in current production areas and in new lands and to quantify the effects of environmental factors and environmental management actions on forest productivity the brazilian 3 pg studies used the monospecific version of 3 pg which does not quantify competition for light and water between tree species or sizes or ages in contrast the maestra model evaluates competition for light and its relationship with the growth of trees by estimating and simulating the absorbed par by the crowns of the individual trees considering the influence of the shading by the leaves within a crown and those of neighboring crowns in the studies by campoe et al 2013 and le maire et al 2019 in eucalypt plantations the authors use maestra model simulations as a tool to evaluate tree absorbed light apar at different spacings on trees with different crown architectures pruning fertilization and the effect of sun position on sloping and flat terrain the value of maespa which incorporates maestra and spa model focused on water availability comes from its ability to simulate and address the effects of climate change on the development of forest ecosystems in order to contribute to future planning of management practices vezy et al 2018 le maire et al 2019 comparing maestra s simulations with lai 200 measurements in 90 ha of eucalypt plantation located in southeastern brazil são paulo state concluded that the maestra model successfully predicted angular gap fractions gf as a function of view angles for all genotypes i e it reproduced the absolute value of gf in the zenith direction mostly linked to lai leaf area index m2 leafm 2 soil as well as the decrease in gf with angular view mostly linked to leaf angle and directional clustering christina et al 2016 used a metamodel approach to evaluate the sensitivity of tree scale maespa model outputs to variability in intertree competition within a stand and to meteorological physiological and morphological factors in the same area of le maire et al 2019 study the authors included a parameter to describe the competition of all neighboring trees by calculating the hegyi competition index this study showed that a competition index can be used in metamodels to replace and or describe some commonly used light competition processes in pbms carbon and water fluxes in this study were highly sensitive to hegyi s ci hegyi 1974 the smallest trees in a stand are generally associated with a high competition index as observed in our eucalypt plantations described in eq s3 in supplemental material2 this dependence on the competition index emphasizes the importance of taking surrounding trees into account to predict carbon and water fluxes at the tree scale even in relatively uniform clonal eucalypt plantations the g day model a population level model like 3 pg incorporates competition indirectly and was used in two studies fig 6 the g day model results of marsden et al 2013 showed that the water retention capacity was specific to each site so there were differences in productivity between stands in the same region in the study by attia et al 2019 g day was used to simulate seasonal variations in growth and carbon and water exchange between the ecosystem and atmosphere during commercial rotations of eucalyptus plantations the fao and aspim models were used to simulate the estimate of potential and achievable growth of eucalyptus plantations with different types of soil and climate zone de freitas et al 2021 elli et al 2019a 2019b however the use of modeling with the aspim model in agroforestry systems was not found but the use of the maestra model in the evaluation of competition in eucalyptus and acaia plantations in which at 54 months it was observed that eucalyptus dominated the acacias le maire et al 2013 nouvellon et al 2012 the study by boyden et al 2008 incorporated a neighborhood effect index in aboveground woody biomass growth models to quantify the effect of competition by the surrounding trees around the focal tree this index was based on the distance dependent competition index of bella 1971 and the shape or importance of the size and distance effects were controlled by the parameters α and β this study was the only one that presented information from a competition index in growth models based on the theory of production ecology or resource partitioning when analyzing the publications over time it was noted that the advancement of technology plays an important role in the application and improvement of models in the use of new methods and modeling fig 6 in g ym we observed that recent articles applied competition indices gini index relative spacing index s and modeling among the pbms 3 pg was the first to be applied but in recent years maespa g day and apsim are also being explored by researchers the interaction between researchers from different countries also meant that new methods were evaluated mainly seeking to minimize and even predict the effects of climate change on plantation productivity updates in pbm models such as 3 pg and asimp are important for providing more realistic and reliable productivity information to make them increasingly applicable tools in forestry companies 5 final considerations competition in growth and production models is adopted indirectly usually using basal area number of trees per hectare beer lambert law as it is considered the least complex method to assess the competitive state of forests there are other methods for incorporating competition in the modeling of growth and production such as competition indices uniformity indices indices of stand density effects on self thinning they are simple equations that use variables commonly measured in forest inventories easy to interpret and can be incorporated into empirical and process based models in eucalyptus and pinus plantations 3 pg and maespa and its previous versions are the most used models in the evaluated scientific articles and with climate change advances in technology and parameterization reserach we foresee an increase in the application of process based models especially maespa apsim and g day to better understand the interactions among productivity and environment genotype and silvicultural practices for current and new plantation areas competition for water and nutrients are the most complex to quantify and evaluate which is why they are included in the pbm by water and nutrient balance sub models there is a potential of pbm in agroforestry systems in brazil mainly with the apsim model brazil has advanced a lot in agroforestry plantations in recent years and even today there is a challenge in quantifying the productivity of these systems at the field level in addition to evaluating the interactions of competition for resources between species the number of articles published on competition in growth and production of eucalyptus plantations incorporating biological process based models was greater than for pinus even though these are more complex models with more difficult parameterization the application of these models in pinus plantations in brazil are still scarce there is a gap for more studies on growth and production to be carried out with the pinus genus in brazil whether empirical modeling but mainly with pbms since in this country there is a region with the highest productivity of pinus taeda in the world our review shows advances in studies of methods and models in a place that has one of the highest productivity of eucalyptus and pine plantations in the world in addition to being one of the most important countries in the forestry sector and the largest pulp exporters in the world world with this it will serve as a support to also support future studies share the methods that can be applied and that can be explored in projects from other countries such as including the pv50 gini and hybrid modeling with meteorological physiological and soil variables although not addressed in this study tools such as remote sensing and lidar can help support the assessment of competition as they can monitor canopy dynamics and the structure of the individual tree this information is important to know the degree of canopy closure tree dominance and growth the metrics extracted from these tools can also be incorporated into empirical and process based models machine learning techniques are also being used to assess the competition between individual trees using a methodology that apply advanced concepts of predictive analysis based on the structured representation of

24154,competition for resources among trees shrubs and weeds in forest plantations is an important factor that directly interferes with the growth and production of forests understanding the ways in which plantation trees compete for resources during their development helps to more accurately estimate tree growth and wood production in models growth and production models are classified as empirical or process based models for both types of models competition is added either directly as a numerical variable or indirectly through submodels that quantify the use of available resources for growth among plants the first part of this article is a contextualization of how competition is embedded in empirical g ym and process based pbm growth and production models the second part is a systematic review between the years 1999 2021 that seeks to answer the questions which species in brazil has the highest number of publications on competition in g ym and pbm which competition assessment methods are used in studies on g ym and pbm in pinus and eucalyptus plantations in brazil what were the advances in studies on competition in g ym and pbm in pinus and eucalyptus plantations the largest number of articles published during the period studied was in eucalyptus plantations which is because there is a larger area of these plantations in brazil compared to pinus plantations the review showed that competition in most articles is treated indirectly using basal area number of trees density and beer lambert law competition is a complex process to assess however not neglected by the models the contrary studies have advanced and shown direct ways to competition by incorporating processes and indices in either g ym and pbm keywords systematic review tree competition growth and yield models individual tree modelling data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction general ecological theory typically divides competition into resource competition and interference competition resource competition also called exploitation competition occurs when two species compete for space light water and nutrients so that one neighbor s consumption of a resource depletes it and makes it unavailable to other plants interference competition occurs when there is direct interference by a neighbor preventing the other weaker individual from having access to a vital resource either through physical aggression or the production of toxic substances which may cause the competitor s extinction it is safe to argue that with plants most of the competition is resource competition but there may be certain cases of interference competition through chemical interactions or physical contact keddy 2017 water light and nutrients are the three main classes of resources limiting plant growth and are considered resources for which individual plants compete the study of resource competition in all its forms is complex due to the unique characteristics of each resource craine and dybzinski 2013 the complexity of competition requires different perspectives for explaining this process and it is examined by its intensity importance effect response and outcome clearly depending on the objective connolly et al 2001 gibson et al 1999 the intensity of competition is defined as the amount that competition reduces the condition of an individual from the ideal while the importance of competition is the degree to which competition contributes to the overall decrease in fitness relative to other processes that affect plant growth keddy 2017 weigelt and jolliffe 2003 however what ecologists typically observe are actually the effects of competition i e reduced plant growth due to the stress of sharing limited resources in its vicinity begon et al 2006 in general it is understood that competition is competition between neighboring individuals for environmental resources light water nutrients and the efficiency with which these resources are used to support growth binkley et al 2010 fernández tschieder and binkley 2018a harper 1982 schwinning and weiner 1998 tilman 1989 vospernik et al 2015 growth and yield models are essential to improve forest management decision making these models are classified as empirical g ym and based processes pbm eg photosynthesis transpiration and respiration despite the importance of understanding competition in planted forests most studies approach competition in growth and production models in a generalized way examining non special measures tree density basal area and intraspecific competition in commercial monoculture plantations e g example cao et al 2021 fadrique et al 2021 vanclay et al 2013 wallraf and wagner 2019 brazil stands out on the international scene for its extensive native tropical forests and the planting of homogeneous forest plantations with exotic species the use of good management practices genetic improvement and soil and climate conditions in the country led to a worldwide recognition of brazil s high productivity potential volume of wood produced per area per year during short intensive rotations in 2020 brazil had average productivity of 36 8 m3 ha per year in eucalyptus plantations while in pine plantations there was an increase in productivity to 31 9 m3 ha ibá 2021 this review aims to identify the advances in quantification methods and competition modeling that serve to improve the growth and production models and based on processes models in brazil first we present an overview of the concept and definition of competition and then describe its use in forest growth and yield models next we analyze the major studies between 1999 and 2021 that have used the concepts of competition and quantified in two classes of growth and yield models empirical and process based models in brazil for pine and eucalypt plantations 2 definitions of competition although many physiological mechanisms are involved in resource capture they are not directly considered in the understanding of resource competition thus competition is often defined in terms of the effects caused on plants and not of the physiological mechanisms that lead plants to experience competition grime 1979 since knowledge of the latter is not always clear as an example a tree shows reduced growth because it suffers crown shading caused by a neighboring tree other genetic and physiological characteristics certainly contribute to this reduction but are not addressed as direct results of competition when evaluating the effect of competition on plant development three main processes need to be considered competition competitive reduction and facilitation kelty 1992 lambers and oliveira 2019 vandermeer 1989 competition occurs when two or more plants or populations interact to impair the growth or cause the death of the other lambers et al 2008 vandermeer 1989 competitive reduction also known as complementarity occurs when the interspecific competition is less than the intraspecific competition kelty 1992 lambers et al 2008 lambers and oliveira 2019 vandermeer 1989 i e when species experience less interspecific than intraspecific competition facilitation occurs when a species has a positive effect on another lambers and oliveira 2019 loreau and hector 2001 vandermeer 1989 and it can occur at the same time as competition perry et al 2008 the definitions of competition in table 1 help to understand the processes that influence tree growth resource sharing and forest stand productivity tree growth is the result of different competition situations so caution must be exercised when relating competition to tree size and growth fernández tschieder and binkley 2018a also the symmetry or asymmetry of tree competition is influenced by other variables such as age type of stand structure stand density climatic variables and edaphic characteristics forrester 2019 2 1 use of competition in growth and yield modeling 2 1 1 empirical growth and yield models g ym forest productivity is estimated by forest growth and yield models where competition is represented by equations variables or indices these models are grouped into four categories empirical models process based models hybrid models and gap models fontes et al 2011 pretzsch et al 2015a weiskittel et al 2011 the main objective of empirical models is to predict the state of forest development and yield over time process based models represent essential physiological processes e g light interception photosynthesis usually to understand and explore the system which are then combined to characterize tree and stand development hybrid models merge resources from empirical and process based models and are used for both understanding and prediction gap models are designed to explore long term ecological processes usually to understand the interactions that control forest species succession weiskittel et al 2011 the models are also classified according to spatial resolution into stand level or individual tree level for some process based models the spatial resolution can be even more detailed going down to the level of an individual leaf within a tree crown in while in empirical models the fitting can also be performed by size class or diameter burkhart and tomé 2012 studies on competition in brazil began with researchers concern with studying the numerous influences of ecology and silvicultural treatments on forest development with the objective of promoting an increase in quantitative and qualitative forest stand yield many of these studies have focused on the relationships between environmental factors and silvicultural treatments especially those that affect stand density growth and yield schneider et al 1992 the market demand for biological products has expanded eucalyptus plantations to dry regions where changes in silvicultural regimes such as reducing the number of trees planted per hectare can reduce tree mortality mitigating the competition for water resources hakamada et al 2017 scolforo et al 2019 early studies on the growth and yield of pine and eucalypt forests were conducted using empirical models and expressed the effects of competition indirectly with the inclusion of the basal area and the number of trees campos 1980 oliveira et al 1991 that is at a stand scale resolution these studies did not focus on quantifying or discussing the effects of competition they only included density variables to better explain and estimate growth and yield measures such as forest density are directly related to competition providing a basis for the management of tree plantations since forest density includes the area used by the trees forest density can be expressed in absolute or relative terms such as in basal area diameter at 1 30 m above the ground π 4 or number of individuals per unit area number of trees hectare or acre the most used in growth and yield models vanclay et al 2013 the individual cultivation area of a tree is defined mainly in monocultures by the ideal cultivation space the space between trees being ideal for them to reach greater growth potential with less competition economically viable and operational therefore at the beginning of silviculture in brazil many tests were performed to determine the best planting spacing e g berenhause 1971 rensi coelho et al 1970 the best spacing is that which is ideal to control the competition for water light and nutrients between the trees maximizing the growth wood density and individual production of each tree studies on stand density have become increasingly necessary and justified to accompany the remarkable evolution in forest management techniques in recent times binkley et al 2020 stape and binkley 2010 another way to represent forest density is indices that relate different dendrometric variables in equations such as the stand density index sdi kimsey et al 2019 reineke 1933 relative spacing index s burkhart 2013 and yoda s self thinning rule condés et al 2017 yoda et al 1963 these indices can identify when competition arises in the forest for thinning to be performed the sdi expresses the stand density using the quadratic mean diameter dg and the number of trees per hectare n that have a diameter of at least 10 4 inches 25 4 cm the slope and intercept of this linear relationship was originally considered to be independent of age site and species but that is no longer considered to be the case reineke 1933 zhao et al 2020 maximum density models often use site index as a covariate to indicate site quality however it is incapable of identifying which site growth factors define and predict maximum stand density kimsey et al 2019 for this recent studies with a maximum sdi frontier model developed models adding variables of stand characteristics tree size species mixing and geographic latitude longitude topographic elevation aspect climatic derivatives of temperature and precipitation and soil site characteristics kimsey et al 2019 yang and burkhart 2017 define the maximum size density ratio as a limit or maximum trade off between the number of trees per unit area and the average size of trees that can be sustained in each stand to obtain this information authors using the reineke density model the competition rule and kira density and nilson index these measures were also used to locate maximum implicit areas of the stand kira s density rule is a logistical form that describes tree competition and thinning behavior chiou et al 2020 kira et al 1953 shinozaki e kira 1956 tadaki 1963 vospernik et al 2015 at a given height of dominant tree the root mean square diameter dg increases with decreasing number of trees per unit area the nilson index concentrates on the mean distance between trees with a linear relationship between the sparseness of the stand l and the mean square diameter dg yang and burkhart 2017 hart becking relative spacing index s or rs is based on the theory that a tree of a given size should have enough space for the development of its crown diameter becking 1953 hart 1928 this index is calculated as the ratio between the mean space of the trees and the dominant stand height assmann 1970 castaño santamaría et al 2021 tartarino et al 2020 s ms hd 100 where s relative spacing index ms mean spacing between trees in meters and hd assmann dominant height in meters the rs has been incorporated in prediction models and development area design for the development of development projects and which is useful in programming stand development projects and which is useful in programming thinning development projects yang and burkhart 2017 evaluated two approaches for estimating basal area with rs the first they was estimated directly by a non linear model of the basal area of the people with rs as an independent variable and in the second s was defined as the ratio between the distance between trees and d d letting rsd be a function of stand age the model of the base area of the stand rs offers a simple and safe way to estimate the occupation of the stand rsd were positively correlated while dispersion and points both s and rsd decreased with the development of the stand therefore in new stands the s estimated by the rsd would be less than accurate than for older stands however as stands develop and approach the lower asymptote the rsd becomes a more reliable measure of s than stands the self thinning rule defined by yoda et al 1963 and propagated by tang et al 1994 determines the average tree weight over the number of surviving trees of a mean diameter logarithmic scale which results in a linear relationship with a common power of 3 2 liu and pennings 2019 mrad et al 2020 when self thinning occurs the equation is w kn 3 2 where w is the mean tree size weight volume height basal area etc n the number of trees per hectare and k a constant considered a measure of the rate required to sustain the established crown area which varies with the crown condition yoda et al 1963 vanclay and sand 2009 studying self thinning of eucalyptus pilularis in queensland examined the complete trajectory of the average stand diameter over a range of densities the trajectory that has a value close to zero in stands with low densities and that increases and approaches of a limiting slope s as the density increases raphaël trouvé et al 2017 addressed a mortality model framework that predicts survival trajectories that follow a line of self thinning they used generalized linear poisson and negative binomial models for count data as well as a nonlinear least squares procedure on the integrated scale to calibrate the mortality model the method increases the possibility of quantifying how environmental factors influence the dynamic equilibrium of self thinning the indices of density effects on self thinning and maximum size density relationships in monospecific forests of uniform age are useful simplifications of stand level allometry that have been used in forest growth models to predict density dependent mortality burkhart and tomé 2012 härkönen et al 2019 forrester et al 2021 for example formit m forest management strategies to enhance the mitigation potential of european forests is a hybrid model that combines process based components standard forest inventory data and climate scenarios among the equations that exist in this model sdi equations are used to estimate the density of the stand and it is also applied in a equation together with the volume to define the new mean diameter competition indices are incorporated into growth and yield models at the individual tree level through relatively simple mathematical expressions that capture the primary effects of competition on tree development kuehne et al 2020 the effect that a neighbor can have on the individual growth of a tree is expressed by the extent to which each tree is affected by its neighbors burkhart and tomé 2012 competition indices are classified into three classes distance dependent distance independent and semi distance dependent ledermann 2010 stage and ledermann 2008 the distance independent class is characterized by using only information on tree size related to a stand density factor the distance dependent indices incorporate the relative locations of neighboring trees ishihara et al 2016 ledermann 2010 moreno et al 2017 semi distance dependent indices were proposed by stage and lerdman 2008 and were developed for circular plots they make it possible to use the basal area factor of the bitterlich sampling but are restricted to a smaller set of neighboring trees i e only those near each other rather than all trees in the sampling unit hui et al 2018 martins et al 2011 among the predictors of competition between individual trees the four most important are the density of competitors the sizes of competitors the distances between the target tree and competitors and the relative locations of competitors pukkala 1989 radtke et al 2003 to date more than 50 types of competition indices have been developed based on those four aspects weigelt and jolliffe 2003 but most of the indices used in growth and yield models are intensity indices i e they quantify the competition that reduces the condition of an individual tree below the ideal these indexes are a long term integration of all competition and complementarity processes table 2 shows some competition indices in the literature forest biometricians continue to develop simple and effective indices of competition that affect mortality in forested areas sharma et al 2002 c l vanderschaaf and burkhart 2007 c l vanderschaaf and burkhart 2007 zeide 2005 the individual tree model although seldom used in brazil martins et al 2011 has often been used in europe the united states canada africa and australia gonzález et al 2006 mabvurira and miina 2002 monty et al 2008 vospernik 2021 the rarer use of these models in brazil is related to variables the distance and crown variables are not commonly measured in inventories other indices that assess planting uniformity size inequality conditions the size hierarchy between individual trees are also important in assessing competition the gini index which originated in production ecology and ecological literature has been used to assess size hierarchy and asymmetric competition in forests however this index is not included in the classification of competition indices distance dependent independent and semi dependent the gini index applied to forests can be graphically very simple areas it is equal to twice the area between the curve representing a cumulative basal area as a function of the cumulative relative value number called the lorenz curve and the straight line the greater the size inequality between individuals the more concave is the lorenz curvature and the greater the gini index cordonnier and kunstler 2015 fernández tschieder and binkley 2018b this index 1 is continuous restricted within the interval 0 1 that is 0 when plants in a forest have exactly the same basal area and approaches at most 1 as the population moves toward a large tree another fact is that its value does not change when the basal area of each tree is multiplied by the same scalar property homogeneity property cordonnier and kunstler 2015 fernández tschieder and binkley 2018 1 g i n i 2 i 1 n i g i n g n 1 n where igi is the basal area of tree i trees are sorted in ascending order n trees number g total basal area gini and size inequality can be positively or negatively correlated with population growth which makes them difficult to use in correlative models due to the variable shape of the pattern ranging from positive neutral to negative gini relations and because they seem to be indicating no specific process except for automatic processes as the result of thinning on size inequality forrester 2019 this makes gini or other inequality indices calculated from tree size as opposed to growth different from many other variables in empirical models because most of the other variables that form the basis for such models produce consistent patterns growth usually increases with stocking density and site indices growth always increases with age to a peak and then starts to decline etc but growth can increase decrease or not change with gini the uniformity of the stand is an alternative to assess the degree of intra specific competition that begins soon after the canopy is closed since the unevenness of planting indicates increased competition less efficient use of resources and reduced productivity binkley 2004 landsberg j sands 2011 ryan et al 2010 stape et al 2006 proposed a uniformity index called pvar50 defined as the accumulated percentage of the dendrometric variable in 50 of the smallest trees planted including planting failures this index was widespread in brazil as pv50 calculated by ordering the trees in the plot from the smallest to the largest tree in individual volume 2 and used to assess survival in initial plantations and to assess the behavior of uniformity in productivity during rotation 2 p v 50 k 1 n 2 v i j k 1 n v i j 100 where v individual volume off plot i in age j n number of trees planted in order from smallest to largest the range between the diameters in the 63rd and 10th percentile used for the adjustment of a distribution and probability function can be considered as representative of the homogeneity of the stand mctague and bailey 1987 these diameters provide an idea of the diameter distribution of the stand and allow us to analyze that a narrower and higher diameter distribution curve indicates a more homogeneous stand with a higher rate of tree growth conversely when the diameter distribution curve is wider and flatter the inequality between trees increases due to the suppression of larger trees over smaller trees then the smaller the diametric range of the plot the higher the uniformity index mctague and bailey 1987 scolforo et al 2019 however this is an index that is rarely used but it is easy to apply as it only uses the diameter variable 3 3 i u j k c m 1 1 d a p p 63 j k d a p p 10 j k where d b h p 63 j k dbh cm at the 63rd percentile of the jthplot d a p p 10 j k dbh cm at the 63rd percentile of the jth plot 2 1 2 competition in process based models pbm process based models pbms differ from empirical models because they aim to represent physiological processes that influence growth rather than developing empirical models that may not have a cause and effect relationship they are therefore often used to evaluate the effect of changing environmental conditions on forest growth pretzsch 2014 weiskittel et al 2011 their use and application have increased in recent years due to the need to consider productivity under climate change becoming an important tool to support adaptive forest management and planning garcia gonzalo et al 2014 these growth and yield models vary in their degree of complexity data used construction and spatial temporal resolution process based to project reliable estimates of forest growth the model parameters need to be calibrated and the estimates need to be validated against observed data using both physical drivers soil and climate and tree growth measurements palma et al 2018 restrepo et al 2022 the main physiological processes considered in process based models are light interception photosynthesis stomatal conductance respiration carbon allocation mortality and water and nutrient dynamics in the soil like empirical models there are a variety of process based models including forest bio geo chemical forest bgc running and coughlan 1988 fao doorenbos and kassam 1979 freitas 2018 apsim agricultural production systems simulato apsim growth huth et al 2001 cabala battaglia et al 2004 balance rötzer et al 2010 physiological principles predicting growth 3 pg landsberg and waring 1997 maespa medlyn 2004 wang and jarvis 1990 generic decomposition and yield g day comins and mcmurtrie 1993 corbeels et al 2005a 2005b marsden et al 2013 and stand leaf cohorts dynamics slcd sainte marie et al 2014 competition in process based models is represented in different ways and few of these models have the direct objective of evaluating or representing competition in most models at the stand scale competition is partly addressed as in empirical models including a density factor such as basal area and number of trees per hectare weiskittel et al 2010 however competition is also represented in the reduction in net photosynthesis as the leaf area index lai increases based on a empirical relationship with the canopy though this does not fully explain the competitive position of the tree within the stand where light interception is mediated by the crown attributes of an individual tree therefore in process based models light interception is estimated by applying the beer lambert law after accounting for the effects of incomplete canopy closure on the sunlit and shaded portions weiskittel et al 2010 according to the beer lambert law 4 vertical transmittance through the forest canopy can be written as 4 τ i exp κ p a i i where p a i i is the cumulative pai until the i t h canopy layer and κ is the attenuation coefficient in the case of a spherical leaf angle distribution for a solar zenith angle θ we have κ 1 2 c o s θ forest bgc was one of the first ecophysiological models used to understand the biogeochemical cycles of carbon water and nitrogen at the stand level running and coughlan 1988 over time the model has undergone modifications and is currently used to estimate individual tree growth tree bgc korol et al 1991 in several biomes worldwide biome bgc white et al 2000 the introduction of the individual tree scale in the forest bgc model occurred with the inclusion of competition korol et al 1995 the proposal was to determine the gross primary productivity at the stand level using the forest bgc approach and then allocate this total to individual trees based on the competition between trees algorithm the competition algorithm incorporates both the light intensity under which the tree grows and the ability of the leaves to photosynthesize due to the light intensity direct and diffuse photosynthetically active radiation par is initially simulated and then allocated to groups of trees with similar heights leading to a significant improvement in the proportional allocation based on the leaf area of the trees korol et al 1995 apsim mccown et al 1996 is a software system has been specifically designed to facilitate cross disciplinary simulation based research apsim can model forest production and apsim can model forest production and is used extensively to assess agricultural management practices risk climate

resource competition for light and soil resources of intercropped plant species and also to investigate the effects shelter using traditional single point simulation methods huth et al 2002 carberry et al 2002 an updated description of the apsim model is provided by holzworth et al 2014 the effect of crop competition on another is simulated by its influence on the level of stocks flows of resources provided by the radiation water and nitrogen modules the absence of any direct communication between culture modules in apsim is the main versatility in modeling competition between species keating et al 2003 the modules within apsim growth are essentially point based models that represent the behavior of the system at some single point in space mccown et al 1996 huth et al 2001 this model functionality allowed huth et al 2001 simulate discrete points within the zone of influence of a windbreak in this case the simulated state of the trees within the windbreak is used to alter the belowground competition and the microclimatic effects of the windbreak at various distances from the trees the use of resources by the trees from the ground in the paddock feeds back into the tree productivity calculations the apsim growth model calculates daily biomass production from intercepted solar radiation and radiation use efficiency which is affected by soil and climatic factors interception of solar radiation is calculated assuming an exponential decay of light within a canopy huth et al 2001 elli et al 2019 the apsim model basic does not present the variable stem volume as an output this model presents only the variable stem dry matter excluding branches elli et al 2019 thus elli et al 2019 used the wood density function proposed by sands and landsberg 2002 to obtain the wood density curve by age and calculate the volume of the tree the apsim model has been modernized and enhanced called apsim next generation for the competition between forest trees its gain was significant as it incorporated new technologies and modeling approaches that allowed for more precise and detailed simulation of competition for resources such as nutrients and sunlight among trees the model also considers the heterogeneity of the environment including variations in topography soil and climate which can influence the competition among trees a detailed description of the updates the model underwent is described by holzworth et al 2018 apsim next generation eucalyptus model was developed and calibrated to simulate the growth of eucalyptus grandis and hybrids with or from e globulus and e urophyylla in brazil and australia and presented aboveground biomass and components as an output option in addition to including more types of plants beyond the main interest in the case of eucalyptus or other types of trees this capability allows simulating a competition between the trees and one or more other plants smethurst et al 2020 the model cabala was created to provide silvicultural decision support for forest managers this model links carbon water and nitrogen flows through the atmosphere trees and soil including soil organic matter this strong linkage between stand biomass allocation and external environmental conditions make this model suitable for exploring stand management options and the effects of factors such as frost and drought on growth battaglia et al 2004 3 pg is a type of stand scale model that integrates empirical forest measurement data from conventional growth and yield models with carbon balance models based on physiological processes sands and landsberg 2002 therefore it is often classified as a hybrid model weiskittel et al 2011 since the initial publication of 3 pg landsberg and waring 1997 several modifications have been made and the way in which the relationships between the parameters are represented has evolved to make the parameters more intuitively significant sands and landsberg 2002 competition is indirectly represented in the 3 pg mortality submodel which is density dependent using the 3 2 self thinning rule bryars et al 2013 drew and flewelling 1977 sands and landsberg 2002 for this purpose the stand basal area is included which is calculated from the diameter at breast height and tree density gupta and sharma 2019 because the 3 pg model was designed for single species stands its original formulation does not allow estimations of interspecific competition with understory plants wei et al 2014 however in studies in northern california usa some new resources were applied through 3 pg to evaluate competition between woody shrubs and young pinus ponderosa stands to simulate the impact of competition of these woody shrubs on tree growth the growth dynamics of the shrubs and subsequently the interaction between shrubs and pines were determined with this two new functions were added to 3 pg to estimate the lai of shrubs ls adding only three new parameters to the model the first function estimates the amount of light that passes through the canopy without limitation where ls is a fixed ratio kl and the second is the phase in which the light becomes a limiting factor estimated by beer s law wei et al 2014 the new version of the 3 pg model was 3 pgmix developed for mixed forests by adjusting sub models using soil water balances and different allometric equations the 3 pgmix provides new insights into forecasting the growth dynamics in forests that have more than one species forrester and tang 2016 there is an r package of the model forrester and tang 2016 which is based on a version of 3 pg for mixed species stands and uneven aged stands the model was used to assess the effects of climate change on the growth of mixed forests in switzerland simulating competition for light and water between different species or between different size age cohorts it also simulates vertical gradients of radiation vpd etc within the canopy and considers the time of leaf fall or budding eg deciduous species the interactions between species or size classes are included directly and are not restricted to an overstory understory interaction because the other 3 pg version also allows species to be mixed within the same canopy layer forrester et al 2021b the 3 pg is among the pbm that has been more applied by companies and in an operational way than the other models mentioned above recent studies combine empirical growth tables or models and pbms to explore the strengths of empirical models that is predictive ability and parsimony in the calibration data and pbms i e sensitivity to changes in environmental conditions in a unified hybrid modeling approach fontes et al 2011 the study using the pbm 4c lasch born et al 2020 which illustrated the benefits of this hybrid approach to evaluate future biomass stocks and different management strategies in europe in brazil almeida et al 2003 demonstrated the possibility of integrating the process based model 3 pg

provided the mai6 values this empirical relationship estimates the si that is applied in e grow arcel to predict growth and yield at stand structure and product profile levels almeida et al 2003 g day comins and mcmurtrie 1993 medlyn et al 2000 is a stand scale model that simulates the major fluxes of carbon water and nitrogen between the atmosphere soil and plant the main ecophysiological processes are represented by simple submodels of c assimilation water and n uptake plant respiration c and n allocation to the growth of different plant compartments litterfall soil organic matter decomposition and evapotranspiration halliday et al 2003 kirschbaum et al 2001 g day like 3 pg has no specific formula to quantify competition but rather addresses competition indirectly by predicting tree growth above and below ground based on the model of mcmurtrie and wolf 1983 g day considers the competition for light water and other nutrients between a canopy of trees and grass species corbeels et al 2005a corbeels et al 2005b the model slcd was designed to simulate foliage renewal and estimate monthly changes of leaf area in response to climate variations from sparse measurements of foliage area and biomass this model was designed for use in a coupling of models combining the advantages of growth yield models and pbms at the stand level in the brazilian eucalypt forest the leaf area index and litterfall were globally predicted with good accuracy and may be improved by using complementary validation data and introducing the influence of climate and nutrients on leaf traits sainte marie et al 2014 architectural models and three dimensional models are widely used to evaluate competition for light the maestra model is a three dimensional process based model that uses calculations of radiation transfer and leaf physiology to calculate radiation absorption photosynthesis and transpiration by trees growing individually or in a population medlyn 2004 wang and jarvis 1990 this model is continuously improved by the scientific community and when coupled with a soil water balance and plant hydraulic model that is based on the spa model of mathew williams williams et al 1996 a model of canopy radiation absorption photosynthesis and water balance called maespa results duursma and medlyn 2012 maestra evaluates intra or interspecific competition for light and the new version called maespa duursma et al 2012 can evaluate the competition for water the model calculates the absorbed par individually as a function of the position of the tree in the stand analyzing the limitations imposed by the shading or not by neighboring trees thus the 3d approach and the geometric representation of the model are important to calculate and simulate light interception and it also takes into account the crown size and position leaf area density distribution leaf angle distribution and the differences in these variables between plants the spatial scale of the maestra spa model can be hourly daily or monthly this information can be at the individual tree level duursma and medlyn 2012 process based resource use efficiency approaches provide dynamic estimates of resource availability at the stand and individual levels as well as a structure for their use based on tree physiology this is important to obtain consistency between resource availability at the stand level and the success of an individual tree in resource competition weiskittel et al 2010 the growth of individual trees depends on the efficiency with which resources water light and nutrients are used to fix carbon for biomass production and competition is explained by the division of these resources between individuals some models such as maespa balance and cabala can simulate the air temperature par rainfall tree phenology and photosynthesis of a stand or individual trees pretzsch et al 2015b purves et al 2007 and ogle and pacala 2009 also addressing the question of the scalability of competition between trees in a process based structure recently demonstrated the usefulness of assuming perfect plasticity of tree crowns in the stand canopy fourcaud et al 2007 highlighted the growing importance of vegetation structure and plant architecture in modeling plant growth growth and production models in addition to monocultures are also important in agroforestry systems in recent years agroforestry systems have been widely implemented due to their economic social and ecological importance with skills in reducing hunger better use by reducing degraded areas and mitigating climate change gomes et al 2020 in this type of system intraspecific competition may be the best assessment of pmb in this type of system spatial configuration refers to the positions of trees in relation to crops within a plot which can be mixed with various levels of intimacy and patterns or separated sinclair 1999 where trees and crops are closely intermingled the spatial configuration horizontally and vertically and above and below ground influences resource capture and competition for resources between components several agroforestry models have already been presented and some that present the competition representation are wanulcas van noordwijk and lusiana 1999 hi safe and yield safe dupraz et al 2005 graves et al 2007 and palma et al 2014 in wanulcas competition is described by first calculating the uptake potential of the combined root systems mycorrhizal hyphae of all plants in all cells layer by zone using a zero uptake model of maximizing water and nutrient uptake and then second introducing expected downregulation at each plant based on its overall supply demand ratio on a given day holzworth et al 2014 the sequence in which walks are applied in such models first tree first harvest or alternating matters a problem avoided in wanulcas hi safe and yield safe utilize water competition between plant components and are managed at the voxel scale based on plant and voxel potentials enabling dynamic water revenue in 3d heterogeneous soil holzworth et al 2014 there is still a lack of sufficiently modular freely accessible and reusable simulation frameworks where tree growth crop growth and components responsible for species competition can be developed by others than the research group original research kraft et al 2021 a list of models that can be used in agroforestry can be found in the study of kraft et al 2021 currently apsim features a framework that focuses on field scale crops and pastures but has the ability to reuse or interoperate with existing models including tree livestock and landscape models uses intuitive and relatively easy to measure parameters and allows analysis of scenarios that may include economy on an agricultural scale luedeling et al 2016 the ability to simulate crop growth in response to competition for solar radiation shading is one of the capabilities of this model that offers the opportunity to simulate agricultural production under the canopy of trees dufour et al 2013 apsim has been used in the modeling of agroforests all over the world with different goals for example is in the comparison of economic viability of the consortium between gliricidia and maize in dry lands of east africa where the consortium productivity was evaluated by the apsim model swamila et al 2021 in ethiopia using the apsim agroforestry model simulations indicated that pruning and fertilization of trees have the potential to increase maize productivity by enhancing light water and nitrogen availability to understory crops dilla et al 2020 smethurst et al 2020 showed that the apsim next generation model applied in eucalyptus studies in 12 locations three in australia and nine in brazil with a wide variety of climate soil and forest can accurately predict the growth of trees and their attributes under different soil and management conditions indicating its potential use in forest plantations to complement existing models the flexibility and openness of the apsim platform also make it a suitable choice for operational and research purposes 3 systematic review structure and methods we conducted a literature search following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses prisma guidelines for systematic moher et al 2009 prisma statement which consists of a identification of records b record screening c article assessment for eligibility and d inclusion of the eligible studies fig 1 this process was accomplished utilizing the software mendeley desktop 1 19 4 and publish or perish pop software https harzing com resources publish or perish harzing 2007 initially focusing on studies that reported competition in pine and eucalypt plantations in brazil because competition is a generic term used in several fields we limited the search to empirical and process based growth and yield models this part of the article aims to answer the following question which species has the highest number of publications on competition in g ym and pbm which competition assessment methods are used in studies on g ym and pbm in pinus and eucalyptus plantations in brazil what were the advances in studies on competition in g ym and pbm in pinus and eucalyptus plantations we searched for peer reviewed articles published between 1999 and 2021 in the web of science scopus and science direct databases using the following keywords title abs key competition and pinus or eucalyptus and process based or ecophysiological or growth and yield and brazil or brasil and not pastures or animal with the exception of the search in the scopus database in which we removed the words and brazil or brasil because no results were returned and used the filter limit to affilcountry brazil we only included articles published in journals indexed in journal citation reports in 2021 and excluded reviews theses institutional dossiers and technical reports the first search resulted in 376 publications in addition five relevant articles recommended by an expert in this area was added which dropped to 127 after filtering out irrelevant studies screening process that is those that did not fall under the focus of the review but that contained the keywords by coincidence the selected articles were read in full and 53 articles that did not meet the following inclusion criteria were excluded eligibility i contained variables that directly or indirectly related to competition 2 presented growth and yield modeling and 3 used empirical or process based models the studies included are in supplementary materials for keywords co occurrences network analysis we used the ris file extracted from mendeley and imported it into the vos viewer 1 6 9 software vosviewer is a free software tool which is used for creating maps based on network data it also helps in visualizing and exploring these maps 4 results and discussion to answer the objective question of this part of the study this section is organized into two subsections described as follows in subsection 4 1 the quantitative results of the search are addressed with an overview of the studies that were included in the analysis subsection 4 2 presents a content analysis based on the results and discussions of the studies relating to how competition was addressed in growth and yield models empirical g ym and process based pbm in pinus and eucalyptus stands in brazil 4 1 overview of studies the literature search included 73 studies 60 on the genus eucalyptus and 8 on pinus fig 2 shows the number of studies found on the topic in the 1999 2021 period according to this database the number of studies per year for eucalyptus since 2006 showed an annually increasing frequency for the genus pinus we observed the publication of studies only in the second decade and without increasing frequency except for 2021 and the latter pattern was similar to the pattern of eucalyptus studies in 1999 2005 the classification of studies by model class and spatial resolution table 3 showed that for eucalyptus there was a small predominance of studies with process based models 45 overgrowth and yield models 44 among growth and yield models studies that used stand level models predominated 23 3 followed by the models by diameter class 8 2 and at the individual tree level 3 7 in the process based model group there was a balance in the number of studies that used models at the stand level 26 and individual tree level 19 of the total studies on the genus pinus made up 11 more specifically 9 used growth and yield models in pine 8 at the stand level and 1 at the individual tree level the remainder of studies in pine were studies with process based models at the stand level 1 the reasons for the difference in the number of studies between the genera are due for example to the edaphoclimatic requirements of each species and consequently to the larger planted area in brazil of eucalyptus 7 47 million hectares than pinus 1 7 million hectares numbers in 2020 ibá 2021 advances in the genetic improvement of eucalyptus species in recent years have enabled the availability of specific clones for each climate zone of the country in the genus pinus the genetic improvement of the species of pinus taeda a species belonging to the most planted genus in the country increased the yield levels of forests that today reach 32 m³ ha 1 year 1 but this yield can only be found in the southern region of brazil where the climatic and soil conditions are favorable another reason is the longer rotation time of pinus which is approximately 12 to 15 years while that of eucalyptus is approximately 7 years ibá 2021 these aspects contribute to the greater demand for studies on eucalyptus than pinus fig 3 shows the keywords cooccurrence network determined by the number of articles available in the selected databases web of science scopus and science direct van eck and waltman 2014 each color represents a cluster the larger circles indicate the frequency of occurrence of a keyword and the line between the keywords represents the relationship between them the bolder the line is the closer the proximity between them the mapping of the cooccurrence of the keywords identified the common and relevant terms highlighted in five clusters i the first cluster in red is characterized by terms related to stand level growth and yield models and process based models ii the second cluster in green contains terms associated with process based models and with variables found in the parameterization of the maestra model such as light capture and leaf area iii the third cluster in blue also contains ecophysiology topics but related to water use and climate iv the fourth cluster in yellow concentrates the main study term competition which was generally found in studies related to site index spacing individual tree growth models forest growth and the genus eucalyptus v the last cluster in purple includes the term growth and yield model and relates it to forest productivity as suggested in density probability models and basal area 4 2 approach to competition the selected studies had different methods and addressed competition directly and indirectly the studies applying empirical growth and yield models to pinus and eucalyptus fig 4 tested different modeling methods to calculate forest productivity such as clutter s and buckman s growth models and differential equations but without the objective of analyzing competition competition indices widely applied in empirical growth and yield models at the individual tree level were used less frequently for both genera and the basal area index of stage 1973 bai was used in all such studies we observed that distance independent competition indices were the most used as they are less laborious since they do not take distance into account information that is often neglected in forest inventories however in forest plantations with standardized spacing this information can be obtained without the need for field measurement competition indices were also included for modeling pinus mortality but only in one study in that study the inclusion of three basal area indices was tested the bai of stage 1973 and the index of tomé and burkhart 1989 were tested in two logistic models one exponential model and buchman s model the results showed that the exponential model with the inclusion of the bai was the most appropriate to estimate the regular mortality of the studied population as it showed the lowest error in the three evaluated sites the relative spacing index s was used in a single study with pinus specie to control the established thinning regime characterize the volumetric stock level and help determine the time of occurrence of self thinning and in the preparation of a management diagram a relative spacing index of 36 was obtained at the young age of 5 years for pinus taeda with a dominant height of 8 5 m and a large availability of living space an s value of 17 1 indicated the onset of competition in the population and was found in adulthood at 20 years of age with a dominant height of 21 9 m pigatto schneider et al 2016 the finger and schneider 1999 study that used the relative space index in eucalyptus was the earliest in the selected database and used it to evaluate different thinning intensities and dominant heights according to stand development in modeling growth and production clonal stands of eucalyptus in brazil scolforo et al 2019 incorporated the s index and the variable water deficit in a set of equations for prediction and projection of the basal area this index being an attribute of the stand that explains much of the environmental impact on basal area growth over time as discussed by scolforo et al 2018 eucalypt plantations in brazil are distributed in a climatic and hydric gradient so some works are incorporating climatic variables in growth and production models competition was also addressed indirectly through density variables of the total stand estimates for pinus used the variables basal area and increment in different spacings and it was observed that the maximum cross sectional area production g in 1 m² spacing occurred when competition was high at 7 8 years age of technical rotation according to basal area in brazil however the maximum biomass production volume had not yet been reached but was predicted to occur later pacheco et al 2015 in the study with the genus eucalyptus mortality was used through the number of trees per hectare and higher mortality was found in stands with high densities which can be attributed to the greater competition experienced by the trees at these densities ferraz filho et al 2018 tang s law was observed in three studies with pinus and in only one with eucalyptus to estimate the density of the total stand with different spacings this method allowed the authors to understand intraspecific competition which is an important factor affecting the mean plant size in a population and therefore has been studied to describe the relationship between plant size and population density as well as its evolution in trees over time schneider et al 2015 gini index were observed two in studies of eucalyptus soares et al 2017 used mixed models with the gini coefficient as the response variable to model the development of heterogeneity in eucalyptus stands subjected to different thinning intensities the decrease in the level of heterogeneity as well as in their development through time was greater the more intense the thinning higher density as related to more intense competition has been shown to intensify asymmetric competition in the direction of a greater disproportional growth of the largest trees the modeling of the gini index showed that the more intense the thinning the less heterogeneous the resulting stands will be since more small trees were removed growth dominance was very close to zero at the beginning of each growth period this is consistent with the open environment created by thinning and with trees with little competition allowing them to grow very proportionately to their size in the study by soares et al 2020 a mixed growth dominance model was constructed to investigate the effects of stand age accumulated soil water deficit and stand structural heterogeneity at the beginning of the growing season lagged gini coefficient on growth dominance in stands of eucalypt distributed in a climatic gradient in brazil the negative growth dominance value of very young stands may result if smaller trees partition a greater proportion of their aboveground biomass to build their crowns or gain a competitive position within the canopy while larger but still young trees partition a greater proportion of biomass to the roots the structural heterogeneity of the stand in terms of the gini coefficient decreased until about 25 months and then slowly increased with age the sdi reineke index and gini index were observed only in studies of eucalyptus the sdi and yoda model were evaluated as density models along with the tang model in the same study in that study the authors noted that analyzing the number of trees per hectare by the mean diameter showed a decreasing density gradient the mean diameter increased in the initial development stage of a stand when the trees are still small the available living space is abundant and even excessive which decreases with the growth of the trees this causes an increase in competition between individuals in the population until the population reaches a developmental stage with high competition when the natural mortality of individuals begins characterizing self thinning schneider et al 2015 we observed that the sdi and the self thinning rule are widely used to evaluate management interventions but they were not incorporated into g ym which is a potential for future studies that incorporate density and competition using variables already obtained from inventories the pv50 was observed in two publications in eucalyptus plantations with the objective of available the impact of uniformity in production and to monitor silvicultural quality uniformity indices are widely applied by companies in brazil to monitor silvicultural operations in order to minimize possible failures that may harm the future productivity of forests the results found in the studies by hakamada et al 2015a 2015b showed that the most uniform plantations at early ages had the highest yields and that the pv50 interval of uniformity iou from 37 to 50 in the sample plots can be considered satisfactorily uniform being the results of the importance of forestry that guarantees the homogeneous supply of resources in this sense we see a potential for including information on the competitive state of the forest through the gini index and uniformity indices and the pv50 as a way to combine the quality of forest stands with estimates of forest growth and productivity these indices could be included in two ways i in the individual g ym models as is done with the competition indices and ii generating a hybrid model including in the g ym of the stand adding the indices in models of dominant height for classification of site or prediction of basal area fig 5 shows the studies that used process based models among these only one study was in the genus pinus it compared the growth of different genetic materials of pinus taeda from the usa and brazil at different planting densities although the objective was not to study competition competition was indirectly incorporated through the light use efficiency and crown structure of the genetic materials at different planting densities the authors observed that the increase in the number of trees per hectare increased the volumetric growth per unit of absorbed light and that genetic materials with broad canopies competed aggressively for resources albaugh et al 2018 the studies that applied process based models to eucalyptus most often used the 3 pg model and the maespa maestra or maestro model 3 pg incorporates competition indirectly so the focus of the studies that used this model was to simulate the potential productivity in terms of forest volume in current production areas and in new lands and to quantify the effects of environmental factors and environmental management actions on forest productivity the brazilian 3 pg studies used the monospecific version of 3 pg which does not quantify competition for light and water between tree species or sizes or ages in contrast the maestra model evaluates competition for light and its relationship with the growth of trees by estimating and simulating the absorbed par by the crowns of the individual trees considering the influence of the shading by the leaves within a crown and those of neighboring crowns in the studies by campoe et al 2013 and le maire et al 2019 in eucalypt plantations the authors use maestra model simulations as a tool to evaluate tree absorbed light apar at different spacings on trees with different crown architectures pruning fertilization and the effect of sun position on sloping and flat terrain the value of maespa which incorporates maestra and spa model focused on water availability comes from its ability to simulate and address the effects of climate change on the development of forest ecosystems in order to contribute to future planning of management practices vezy et al 2018 le maire et al 2019 comparing maestra s simulations with lai 200 measurements in 90 ha of eucalypt plantation located in southeastern brazil são paulo state concluded that the maestra model successfully predicted angular gap fractions gf as a function of view angles for all genotypes i e it reproduced the absolute value of gf in the zenith direction mostly linked to lai leaf area index m2 leafm 2 soil as well as the decrease in gf with angular view mostly linked to leaf angle and directional clustering christina et al 2016 used a metamodel approach to evaluate the sensitivity of tree scale maespa model outputs to variability in intertree competition within a stand and to meteorological physiological and morphological factors in the same area of le maire et al 2019 study the authors included a parameter to describe the competition of all neighboring trees by calculating the hegyi competition index this study showed that a competition index can be used in metamodels to replace and or describe some commonly used light competition processes in pbms carbon and water fluxes in this study were highly sensitive to hegyi s ci hegyi 1974 the smallest trees in a stand are generally associated with a high competition index as observed in our eucalypt plantations described in eq s3 in supplemental material2 this dependence on the competition index emphasizes the importance of taking surrounding trees into account to predict carbon and water fluxes at the tree scale even in relatively uniform clonal eucalypt plantations the g day model a population level model like 3 pg incorporates competition indirectly and was used in two studies fig 6 the g day model results of marsden et al 2013 showed that the water retention capacity was specific to each site so there were differences in productivity between stands in the same region in the study by attia et al 2019 g day was used to simulate seasonal variations in growth and carbon and water exchange between the ecosystem and atmosphere during commercial rotations of eucalyptus plantations the fao and aspim models were used to simulate the estimate of potential and achievable growth of eucalyptus plantations with different types of soil and climate zone de freitas et al 2021 elli et al 2019a 2019b however the use of modeling with the aspim model in agroforestry systems was not found but the use of the maestra model in the evaluation of competition in eucalyptus and acaia plantations in which at 54 months it was observed that eucalyptus dominated the acacias le maire et al 2013 nouvellon et al 2012 the study by boyden et al 2008 incorporated a neighborhood effect index in aboveground woody biomass growth models to quantify the effect of competition by the surrounding trees around the focal tree this index was based on the distance dependent competition index of bella 1971 and the shape or importance of the size and distance effects were controlled by the parameters α and β this study was the only one that presented information from a competition index in growth models based on the theory of production ecology or resource partitioning when analyzing the publications over time it was noted that the advancement of technology plays an important role in the application and improvement of models in the use of new methods and modeling fig 6 in g ym we observed that recent articles applied competition indices gini index relative spacing index s and modeling among the pbms 3 pg was the first to be applied but in recent years maespa g day and apsim are also being explored by researchers the interaction between researchers from different countries also meant that new methods were evaluated mainly seeking to minimize and even predict the effects of climate change on plantation productivity updates in pbm models such as 3 pg and asimp are important for providing more realistic and reliable productivity information to make them increasingly applicable tools in forestry companies 5 final considerations competition in growth and production models is adopted indirectly usually using basal area number of trees per hectare beer lambert law as it is considered the least complex method to assess the competitive state of forests there are other methods for incorporating competition in the modeling of growth and production such as competition indices uniformity indices indices of stand density effects on self thinning they are simple equations that use variables commonly measured in forest inventories easy to interpret and can be incorporated into empirical and process based models in eucalyptus and pinus plantations 3 pg and maespa and its previous versions are the most used models in the evaluated scientific articles and with climate change advances in technology and parameterization reserach we foresee an increase in the application of process based models especially maespa apsim and g day to better understand the interactions among productivity and environment genotype and silvicultural practices for current and new plantation areas competition for water and nutrients are the most complex to quantify and evaluate which is why they are included in the pbm by water and nutrient balance sub models there is a potential of pbm in agroforestry systems in brazil mainly with the apsim model brazil has advanced a lot in agroforestry plantations in recent years and even today there is a challenge in quantifying the productivity of these systems at the field level in addition to evaluating the interactions of competition for resources between species the number of articles published on competition in growth and production of eucalyptus plantations incorporating biological process based models was greater than for pinus even though these are more complex models with more difficult parameterization the application of these models in pinus plantations in brazil are still scarce there is a gap for more studies on growth and production to be carried out with the pinus genus in brazil whether empirical modeling but mainly with pbms since in this country there is a region with the highest productivity of pinus taeda in the world our review shows advances in studies of methods and models in a place that has one of the highest productivity of eucalyptus and pine plantations in the world in addition to being one of the most important countries in the forestry sector and the largest pulp exporters in the world world with this it will serve as a support to also support future studies share the methods that can be applied and that can be explored in projects from other countries such as including the pv50 gini and hybrid modeling with meteorological physiological and soil variables although not addressed in this study tools such as remote sensing and lidar can help support the assessment of competition as they can monitor canopy dynamics and the structure of the individual tree this information is important to know the degree of canopy closure tree dominance and growth the metrics extracted from these tools can also be incorporated into empirical and process based models machine learning techniques are also being used to assess the competition between individual trees using a methodology that apply advanced concepts of predictive analysis based on the structured representation of
