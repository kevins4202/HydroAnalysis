renewable energy resources and investment on ocean energy development is increasingly growing pelc and fujita 2002 khan et al 2017 melikoglu 2018 nguyen and dong 2019 although today most of the energy projects are very near from the shore the huge potential may bring marine energy development further into deep sea in near future lehmann et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 wu et al 2019 it is generally acknowledged that the bulk power transmission between the onshore electrical grid and the offshore platforms is a bottleneck of energy development firestone et al 2018 li et al 2020 the onshore power transmission manner using bottom fixed lattice towers is no longer suitable for deep offshore applications water depth 50 m myhr et al 2014 though submarine cables would be an alternative the fabrication and maintenance cost would be too high for the long distance application moreover as the hvac submarine cables are possible only up to 100 km fischer et al 2012 power transmission based on hvdc cables would be required in practical situations though there are lots of challenges on the placement of all necessary equipment cables transformers power converters switch gear etc either floating or underwater at very deep waters de alegria et al 2009 pope et al 2017 kwon et al 2017 overhead power transmission using floating towers has recently been studied zhu et al 2020 hu et al 2020 zhu and hu 2021 the overview of the system compared with the submarine cable is shown in fig 1 fopts can not only relax the electrical insulation but also reduce the complexity of maintenance during the operation the floating towers can also be placed with more flexibility so that the system would be less dependent on the geography of sea bed in addition power transmission in hvac manner which is low cost and the technologies have been mature would remain possible thanks to the low impedance of bare conductor barthold et al 2010 kalair et al 2016 although fopts has many advantages the technologies on design installation operation and maintenance have not been established development of fopts should gain from previous experience in floating offshore wind turbines fowt over the last decade the floating foundation cost for wind turbines was reduced more than 50 as new technologies were utilized to improve the structure design and installation kausche et al 2018 adam et al 2014 questionnaire responses from experts show that fixed and floating offshore wind solutions will reach the same levelized cost of energy lcoe in the near future wiser et al 2016 the technological advances in fowt could help us to see a glimmer of hope on developing economical floating foundations for fopts considerations necessary for floating foundation design include the stabilization type spar semi sub tension leg platform the mooring system type catenary taut or tension leg and the anchor type gravity anchors drag anchors pile anchors suction caissons bhattacharya 2019 tension leg platform tlp concept would be promising for fopts because the limited platform motion are expected to reduce the loads on tower and transmission conductor compared to other floating concepts without requiring the large draft of a spar or spread mooring system of a semi submersible in this study design and dynamic analysis of a tlp based fopts are considered unlike to onshore power transmission that the reliability of system mainly lies on the dynamics of the conductor desai et al 1995 the feasibility of an fopts would be largely dependent on the interaction between floating towers and conductors 41 have demonstrated that the characteristics of a floating tower would vary significantly from their pre designed value if conductors are rigidly connected to floating towers to reduce the coupling effects between floating towers and conductors a sheave mechanism has been proposed to mount one end of conductor on its supportive tower in the study and experimental results demonstrated that the natural frequencies of the floating tower become insensitive to the conductor the study provides some pioneering investigation on fopts however the design criteria and dynamical response of the system under ocean environments have not been discussed this paper is to extend the previous study at first a mathematical optimization approach is proposed to design the properties of floating towers and conductors the placement of the system s natural frequencies is taken into account in the design to avoid first order wave excitation then a numerical model is presented to study the aero hydro elastic dynamics of fopts with emphasis on the wind wave misalignment finally the design of a moderate fopts is presented and the fully coupled time domain simulation is studied in the following sections several of the specifications referred to an inertial reference frame and platform degrees of freedom dofs are used the letters x y and z represent the orthogonal axes of the inertial reference frame with the x y plane designating the still water level swl and the z axis directed upward along the centerline of the tower the x axis is coincident with the transmission lines and the y axis is determined by the right hand rule positive surge is defined along the positive x axis sway is along the y axis and heave is along the z axis positive roll is defined about the positive x axis pitch is about y axis and yaw is about z axis 2 parametric design submerged tlps are considered as the supportive platforms for fopts because they have large water plane area for self stabilization during transportation and small water plane area for reducing wave loads during operation the platform is of triangular shape since it would save materials for both hull and tethers and the foundation could be placed with larger tolerances compared to a four legged tlp chandrasekaran and jain 2002 the overview of a floating tower is shown in fig 2 the anchor is a gravity anchor however a suction pile a driven pile or any other anchoring means may also be used depending on seabed conditions synthetic fiber ropes such as kevlar ropes are considered as the tendons since they are light and can retain strength even when wet henderson et al 2010 the platform is placed that one of its lines of symmetry is in parallel with the transmission lines tubular steel towers are applied for supporting the transmission lines since they are proved to be robust for fowt stavridou et al 2018 on the tower top a sheave is applied as the intermediate mechanism between the tower and one end of conductor another end of the conductor is connected to an adjacent tower rigidly a weight set is applied to strain the conductor and the mass of the weight set so as the conductor tension is considered to be adjustable in response to external aero loads by the consideration the sag of the conductor would be limited within a safe value even in harsh environments in practical situation a pulley block would be applied to reduce the mass of the weight set and one example is illustrated in fig 2 2 1 design criteria for tlp considering the critical case that the wind travels in the perpendicular direction of the transmission lines as shown in fig 3 the following equations are held according to static force analysis 1 3 f 0 sin α f a c f a t 2 3 f 0 cos α ρ w g v s m t g 3 δ f l 0 cos α m a where ρ w is the water density g the gravitational acceleration α the tilt angle at tendon connector v s and m t the displacement and mass of the floating tower respectively l 0 the distance between tendons f 0 1 3 ρ w v s m t g the initial tendon force under still water and windless condition δ f the variation of the tensile force of the upwind tendon and the downwind tendon f a c and f a t the aero load on the conductor and tower respectively and m a the aero moment in static design the elasticity of the tendons and the tilt of the floating tower are not taken into account to avoid snap loads and to prevent the yield strength of the tendons the following critical conditions are required for a tlp bachynski and moan 2012 4 δ f f 0 f p 5 a m κ f 0 σ where f p and κ are safety factors to avoid tlp over turning and tendon snap respectively a m and σ are the cross sectional area and yield strength of tendon one leg respectively for a tlp floating wind turbine the factor κ can be set as κ 2 bachynski and moan 2012 as there are interaction between floating towers and conductors larger safety margin would be necessary and κ is set as κ 2 5 in this study in addition it is normally required that the mean offset of the platform should not exceed 5 of the water depth in order to limit the angle at the tendon connectors chakrabarti 2005 therefore the following condition is also considered during the design 6 tan α f a c f a t ρ w g v s m t g 5 2 2 design criteria for conductor as the transmission conductors have to be carried at a sufficient height from the sea surface the conductor sag between two supportive towers should be kept to a proper value to reduce the conductor material and to avoid extra tower height the design conditions for a conductor would be 7 d d e t t e f e where d and t are the conductor sag and the horizontal component of the conductor tension respectively d e the maximum sag t e and f e the tensile strength and safety ratio of conductor respectively the tension t can be expressed as 8 t w s 2 8 d where w w a 2 w m 2 is the distributed load per unit length on the conductor taking account of the aero load w a and the conductor weight w m 2 3 criteria for system s eigenfrequencies to avoid first order wave excitation the eigenfrequencies of fopts should be taken into account during the design for a tlp based structure the natural frequencies in surge sway and yaw are generally designed in low frequency zone whereas its heave roll and pitch are in high frequency zone bachynski and moan 2012 in addition the vibration modes of conductor would be designed in high frequency zone by reference to onshore overhead power transmission system matsumiya et al 2018 therefore a reasonable placement of the frequencies is demonstrated in fig 4 the term ω t i i x y z ϕ θ ψ in the figure denotes the natural frequency of floating tower in i dof the interval ω l ω h is wave frequency zone ω 0 is the modal wave frequency ω e represents the vibration modes of conductor and ω e l is a bound to separate the natural frequencies of floating tower and the vibration modes of conductor therefore the design criteria for the system to avoid first order wave excitation can be expressed as 9 ω t x y ψ ω l 10 ω h ω t z ϕ θ ω e l 11 ω e 1 ω e l where ω e 1 the first vibration mode of conductor 2 4 parametric approach as the coupling effects between the supportive towers and conductor could be reduced thanks to the sheave mechanism the properties of tlp and the sag of conductor are designed separately by 12 find v p m p i p x y z m a x y z i a x y z a m l 0 subject to conditions 4 5 6 9 10 and 13 find d subject to condition 7 11 where v p m p and i p x y z are the displacement mass and principal moment of inertia of platform respectively m a x y z and i a x y z the added mass and added moment of inertia of the floating tower respectively since the conductor can be regarded as a taut string the first vibration mode of conductor can be expressed by 17 14 ω e 1 1 s t m c π w 8 d m c π where s is the tower span and m c is the conductor mass per unit length for a submerged tlp with small water plane area the uncoupled natural frequencies can be approximated by 18 15 ω t x ρ w g v s m t g m t m a x h ω t y ρ w g v s m t g m t m a y h ω t z 3 k t m t m a z ω t ϕ k t l 0 2 2 i t x i a x ω t θ k t l 0 2 2 i t y i a y ω t ψ ρ w g v s m t g i t z i a z h l 0 2 3 where h and k t are the length and stiffness of the tendon respectively it is noteworthy that the mass of conductor and tendons is regarded to be small compared to the platform and negligible in the design as the conductor tension would be adjusted by tuning the effective mass of the weight set the program 13 can be reduced to the following program by taking account of windless condition and the harshest wind condition 16 maximize d 0 d n subject to w m 8 d 0 m c π ω e l w n 8 d n m c π ω e l t 0 w m s 2 8 d 0 t e f e t n w n s 2 8 d n t e f e d 0 d n d e where d 0 and d n are the sag of conductor under windless condition and harsh wind condition respectively w n is the distributed load on the conductor per unit length under the harsh wind speed this problem can be separated into two linear programming problems and would be effectively solved by iterative methods such as simplex method nelder and mead 1965 in addition in order to find out a solution for the problem 12 the following assumptions are given in advance the volume and mass of the platform increase as the cube of pontoon length l such as that v p a l 3 and m p b l 3 where a and b are constant in addition the radii of gyration of the platform increase linearly with l so that the principal moment of inertia becomes i p i m p l p i 2 i x y z where p i are constant the added mass m a i and added principal moment of inertia i a i i x y z increase linearly with the displacement of the floating tower that m a i ϵ i ρ w v s and i a i ρ w v s l q i 2 respectively the terms ϵ i and q i are the parameters to be designed in practical situation ϵ i and q i can be adjusted in some degree by changing the shape of the pontoons and or mounting fins on the pontoons moreover the distance between the tendons l 0 is also expressed as a function of pontoon length l as l 0 1 ν l where ν is a parameter to be designed ν 0 means the distance between the tendons is smaller than the pontoon length based on the assumptions the program 12 can be re written as the following nonlinear optimization problem 17 minimize l a m subject to f 0 f p m a 1 ν l f a c f a t ρ w g v s m t g 5 2 5 f 0 σ a m ρ w v s m t m t ϵ i ρ w v s g h ω l i x y ρ w v s m t i t z ρ w v s l q z 2 g h 1 ν 2 l 2 3 ω l ω h 3 k t m t ϵ z ρ w v s ω e l ω h 1 2 k t 1 ν 2 l 2 i t i ρ w v s l q i 2 ω e l i x y with variables l a m ϵ x y z q x y z ν the pontoon length l and the cross sectional area a m are set as the objectives to be minimized in order to reduce the cost of tlp this is a constrained multiobjective optimization problem and several algorithms such as the evolutionary algorithms gunantara 2018 can be applied for solving the problem after solving the problem 17 a tlp can be designed based on the pontoon length l and the coefficients ϵ x y z q x y z an example will be illustrated in section 4 3 numerical model of fopts in general the reliability of fopts can be obtained by setting the safety factors f p and f e with large values however the design would be conservative a better alternative is to set the safety factors with some proper values and evaluate the reliability of fopts iteratively by numerical simulation for this purpose a modeling method is presented in the following 3 1 conductor model lumped parameter method which approximates a flexible body as a collection of several discrete flexible units is applied for modeling the conductor one flexible unit comprises two mass elements coupled with joints and the deformation properties of the unit can be possessed by the internal springs and dampers of the joints the overview of the method is shown in fig 5 to capture the deformation modes of the conductor a gimbal joint and a prismatic joint connected in series are applied by the approach each flexible unit has three rotational dofs and one translational dof the spring coefficients set for the joints are obtained by hooke s law 18 k a e a l for axial deformation k r e i l for bending deformation k t g j l for torsional deformation where e g i j and a are the young s modulus shear modulus second moment of sectional area torsional constant and sectional area of the conductor respectively the damping ratio of the joints can generally be assigned according to some benchmark experiments in practical situation the aerodynamic loads on each flexible unit are calculated based on the quasi steady aerodynamics theory 19 d f 1 2 ρ a v rel v rel d c c d d l c where ρ a is the air density v rel the local relative velocity d c the diameter of the conductor c d the drag coefficient and d l c the length of the flexible unit 3 2 sheave model the flexibility provided by the sheave is modeled by a prismatic joint and the schematic view of the modeling is shown in fig 6 the dynamical conductor tension f p can be approximated as 20 f p t m w x w b p x c where m w and x w are the mass and displacement of the weight set respectively b p is the damping coefficient and x c is the travel position of the prismatic joint the displacement x w can be calculated by 21 x w x c x t where x t is the motion of tower top in surge dof 3 3 model of floating tower regarding the floating tower as a rigid body the motion can then be expressed by 12 22 η j η v 23 m r b v c r b v v τ where v r 6 is the velocity vector expressed in the body fixed coordinate frame η r 3 s 3 the position and orientation vector expressed in the inertial reference frame j the frame transformation matrix m r b the rigid body inertia matrix c r b the rigid body coriolis centripetal matrix due to the rotation and τ the vector of external forces and moments that can be written as 24 τ f rad f res f aero f exc f mooring where f rad is the radiation loads f res the restoring loads f aero the aerodynamic loads on the tower f exc the wave excitation loads and f mooring the mooring force by tendons the mooring force f mooring can be expressed as a linear function of tendon displacement by hooke s law the aerodynamic loads f aero are determined by quasi steady aerodynamics theory based on tower diameter drag coefficient and the local relative velocity the restoring loads are calculated by linear model 25 f res ρ g 0 0 a w p z gm t ϕ gm l θ 0 where is the displacement a w p the water plane area z the displacement in heave gm t and gm l the metacentric height in transverse and longitudinal direction respectively ϕ θ ψ the euler angles of the floating tower in addition the radiation load and wave excitation loads considering both first and second order wave loads are expressed by 26 f rad a v t k t τ v τ d τ 27 f exc 1 r j 1 n ζ j γ ω j β e i ω j t φ i ϵ j 28 f exc 2 r j 1 n i 1 n ζ i ζ j d ω i ω j β e i ω i ω j t φ i φ j j 1 n i 1 n ζ i ζ j s ω i ω j β e i ω i ω j t φ i φ j where a is the added mass at infinite frequency k the retardation function ζ i 2 s ω i δ ω s the wave spectrum and δ ω the constant difference between the successive frequencies the wave amplitude of i th wave component γ and φ the amplitude and phase of the first order force raos β the wave direction ϵ the random phase angle d and s are the difference and sum frequency quadratic transfer functions qtfs the operator r x takes the real part of the complex number x the retardation function k can be calculated by 29 k t 2 π 0 b ω cos ω t d ω where b is the linear radiation damping matrix potential flow program such as hydrostar bureau veritas 2016 can be applied to calculate the added mass potential damping first order and second order wave excitation loads 3 4 numerical environment simmechanicstm which is a multi body simulation environment for 3d mechanical systems is used to model the fopts by the toolbox a multi body system can be handled using blocks to represent bodies joints constraints force elements and sensors the system is assembled by simply connecting the ports of the blocks and the equations of motion for the complete mechanical system can be solved efficiently the schematic diagram of the proposed model is shown in fig 7 a coordinate transform block and a 6 dof joint are applied to set the initial position and the motion degrees of freedom of the floating tower respectively the position of the mooring points both on the platform and seabed and the tower top that the conductor is connected to are defined by coordinate transform blocks linear spring damper blocks are applied to connect the mooring points on the platform and seabed to model the tendons as shown in the dashed box in fig 7 the tension of a tendon can be calculated based on the distance displacement of the tendon connectors the aero and hydro loads on the system are implemented by user defined function blocks 4 a numerical study 4 1 static design overhead power transmission for a moderate wind farm with a capacity of 90 mw three phase power transmission under 66 kv is considered the sea depth is h 0 120 m the conductor wire acsr410 mm 2 ampacity 830 a and the optical fiber wire opgw64 mm 2 are applied as the power conductor and ground wire respectively and their properties are listed in table 1 ice accretion which would increase surface roughness and diameter of the conductor is taken into account and the diameter is assigned to increase by 20 the tower height is set as h 0 35 m according to the voltage level of the transmission lines in addition the span between two consecutive towers is set as s 250 m by reference to onshore overhead power transmission system a tubular tower supported by guy wires is applied as the supportive tower and the design aspects of the tower are given in table 2 the radius and the thickness of the tower are assumed to be linearly tapered from the tower base to the tower top the effective density of the steel is taken to be ρ t 8250 kg m 3 which is meant to be an increase above steel s typical value of 7850 kg m 3 to account for paint bolts welds and flanges that are not included in the tower thickness data the resulted mass of the tower is about 9500 kg the mass of the platform is assumed to be mainly distributed on the cylindrical thin pontoons the thickness t and the length l of the pontoons are set to increase linearly with the diameter d p such as that t 0 008 d p and l 5 d p in addition the young s modulus as well as the yield strength of the tendons are set as e m 70 gpa and σ 1 430 mpa respectively a violent typhoon condition is considered and the wind speed for the static design is set as v w 70 m s the designed aero load on the platform is about m a 8 86 1 0 6 nm other parameters for the static design are given in table 3 by the settings the program 16 and 17 can be solved by matlab functions linprog and fgoalattain respectively and the results are given in table 4 note that the constraint functions of the program 17 are non convex so that the solution is a local optimum a conceptual design of the platform is shown in fig 8 heave plates and truncated pontoons are applied for increasing the added mass in heave and yaw dofs the properties of the platform are summarized in table 5 hydrostar bureau veritas 2016 which provides a complete solution of first order problem of wave diffraction and radiation and also the quadratic transfer function qtf of second order wave loads is applied for computing the hydrodynamics of the floating tower the amplitude of the difference frequency qtf in sway and the sum frequency qtf in roll under transverse waves β 90 are shown in fig 9 the difference frequencies are chosen to include the natural frequencies in surge sway and yaw dofs and the sum frequencies include the natural frequencies in heave roll and pitch dofs 4 2 dynamic analysis a system consisting of three floating towers one fixed tower and one floating substation is considered and the overview of the system is shown in fig 10 the floating substation applied in fukushima forward offshore wind farm yoshimoto et al 2018 wright et al 2020 is applied in the numerical model the transmission lines between two adjacent towers are supposed to be bundled and represented by one single conductor for reducing the computational load the conductor is discretized into 20 flexible units and the damping ratios for linear bending torsional deformation are set as 4 2 1 0 4 n m s 1 0 1 0 1 n m rad s and 7 0 1 0 2 n m rad s respectively according to our previous benchmark experiments 4 2 1 free decay tests free decay tests are performed to study the characteristics of floating tower and conductor for comparison the following three cases are studied case 1 individual floating tower case 2 fopts without using sheaves the ends of conductor are rigidly connected to floating towers case 3 fopts with sheaves in the tests the middle floating tower are initially displaced a little away from their equilibrium position the towers can then oscillate around the equilibrium position whereas the amplitude of the oscillations is gradually reduced with time the motion of the floating tower in surge and pitch are compared in fig 11 as the free decay response in sway heave roll and yaw dofs does not record much difference between the three cases their comparison are not plotted in the figure compared to case 1 it can be found that the oscillation period in case 2 becomes smaller in surge in addition multiple oscillation components are recorded in pitch motion owing to the interaction between towers and conductor however it can be observed from the results of case 3 that the characteristics of the tower motion can almost be maintained when sheaves are applied the natural frequencies of the tower under the three cases are compared in table 6 the response during free decay tests records a similar behavior compared to the experimental tower presented in 41 and therefore the effectiveness of the numerical model is demonstrated moreover hammer test method are applied to study the characteristics of conductor between two consecutive towers and the motion at the middle point of the conductor are recorded and the results are shown in fig 12 it can be found that the out of plane motion of the conductor behaves very similarly between case 2 and case 3 from the simulation results it can be calculated that the first vibration modes are ω ˆ e 1 1 41 rad s which is very close to the theoretical value ω e 1 1 44 rad s by 14 in in plane motion the conductor in case 3 can oscillate with its own vibration mode whereas the conductor in case 2 is highly affected by the supportive towers and moves with multiple vibration components therefore it can be obtained that the coupling effects between the conductor and the supportive towers are reduced by sheaves 4 2 2 fopts in a harsh environment in this section fopts in a harsh environment is studied to evaluate the reliability of the system as the natural frequencies of the fopts are small say within 1 min and therefore short term wind conditions need to be taken into account typhoon sinlaku naval oceanography portal 2008 one of the strongest typhoons near western north pacific ocean area in recent 20 years is considered for reference and the wind speed for the numerical model is set as v w 70 m s the significant wave height and the modal wave period are set as h s 14 m and t 0 16 7 s respectively according to the study on estimation of typhoon generated maximum wave height presented in 14 the waves are generated using the modified pierson moskowitz mpm model fossen 2011 and the wave spectrum is shown as the solid line in fig 13 the wave spectrum of several other sea states are also plotted in the figure for comparison it can be found the harsh sea state under consideration could cover most other sea states and therefore the harsh wave condition would be proper for studying the reliability of fopts the condition that the wind travels in the perpendicular direction of the transmission lines which would be the severest situation is studied four wave directions 0 30 60 90 considering wind wave misalignment are applied to reduce the computational loads the substation is limited to move in horizontal plane and the following 6 order linear model is applied to express the motion raos of the substation 30 g s k s s s 2 2 λ s ω s s ω s 2 k w s s 2 2 λ w ω w s ω w 2 ω p s ω p 2 where ω s and ω w are the natural frequency of the substation and the modal wave frequency respectively the parameters k s λ s k w λ w and ω p are tuned according to the measurements a comparison between the measurement re plotted from 35 and the linear model is shown in fig 14 the linear model would be proper for this study since the motion of the substation is small and shows a linear trend to the wave height wright et al 2019 after the settings the simulation is performed and the statistical characteristics of the floating tower are shown in fig 15 it can be found that the mean motion of the tower is almost insensitive to the wave directions which indicates that the mean tower motion is dominated by the aero loads however the variation of the tower motion in horizontal motion changes remarkably under different wave directions especially a large variation in yaw is induced by the wind wave misalignment in large yaw motion a large deflection angle at the sheave would be caused and the wire which is applied for straining the conductor might be wound during the operation therefore some other method such as improving the triangular platform to reduce the hydrodynamics in yaw dof would be required in practical situation the tendon force under transverse waves wave direction is 90 are shown in fig 16 the simulation results in the beginning 100 s are regarded as the transition state and not plotted in the figure it can be observed that the tendons are in safe operation situation since they are maintained in tight and the tensile force is less than the designed tension force 2 5 f 0 where f 0 1 56 1 0 6 n is the initial tendon tension in addition the normalized power spectral density psd of the tower motion and conductor variation in plane are plotted in fig 17 in comparison with the waves it can be confirmed that the horizontal motion of the tower are dominated by their natural frequencies owing to the fact that when the platform moves periodically away from the equilibrium position the depth of the platform varies accordingly with a double frequency there is a heave vibration mode appeared at 2 ω t y ω t y is the natural frequency in sway dof in addition it can also be observed that the self excited vibration modes of the conductor ω e are suppressed in the harsh wind speed owing to the large aero damping from the results it is noteworthy that the natural frequencies of the tower in roll and pitch dofs vary away from their designed value from 1 38 rad s to 0 98 rad s and 1 38 rad s to 1 10 rad s respectively which violates the design criteria in some level this would be caused by the tendon tilt which decreases the restoring coefficients in roll and pitch in practical situation this problem should be taken into account especially when the ocean currents are taken into account 5 conclusion this paper described a design and numerical modeling method on studying a tlp based fopts the properties of the tlp and the conductor were designed via a mathematical optimization approach the natural frequencies of fopts were taken into account in the design to avoid the first order wave excitation in the model the lumper parameter method was applied to account for the flexibility of the conductor and both the first and second order wave loads were considered in the hydrodynamics an fopts for a sea depth of 120 m was designed practically and the dynamic analysis under a harsh environment was performed by considering the wind wave misalignment from this paper it can be obtained that static design and dynamic analysis would be applicable for studying an fopts to obtain a non conservative design from the results of the example it can be found that the natural frequencies of fopts could be properly designed the tendons could be remained in tight and the tension could be kept within the pre designed value the horizontal shift of the platform under harsh winds would affect the characteristics of the floating tower and the natural frequencies of the tlp might fall into the wave frequency zone this problem should be taken into account especially when ocean currents are considered wind wave misalignment would significantly affect the tower motion in yaw dof the structure of the platform should be improve to reduce the hydrodynamics in yaw so that the affects of wind wave misalignment would be suppressed in general this study provides an initial evaluation on the floating offshore overhead power transmission more studies such as a comprehensive evaluation on platform design in comparison with other platform structures and a study on conductor galloping would be necessary in practical situations credit authorship contribution statement hongzhong zhu conceptualization methodology software experiment writing changhong hu

2020 zhu and hu 2021 the overview of the system compared with the submarine cable is shown in fig 1 fopts can not only relax the electrical insulation but also reduce the complexity of maintenance during the operation the floating towers can also be placed with more flexibility so that the system would be less dependent on the geography of sea bed in addition power transmission in hvac manner which is low cost and the technologies have been mature would remain possible thanks to the low impedance of bare conductor barthold et al 2010 kalair et al 2016 although fopts has many advantages the technologies on design installation operation and maintenance have not been established development of fopts should gain from previous experience in floating offshore wind turbines fowt over the last decade the floating foundation cost for wind turbines was reduced more than 50 as new technologies were utilized to improve the structure design and installation kausche et al 2018 adam et al 2014 questionnaire responses from experts show that fixed and floating offshore wind solutions will reach the same levelized cost of energy lcoe in the near future wiser et al 2016 the technological advances in fowt could help us to see a glimmer of hope on developing economical floating foundations for fopts considerations necessary for floating foundation design include the stabilization type spar semi sub tension leg platform the mooring system type catenary taut or tension leg and the anchor type gravity anchors drag anchors pile anchors suction caissons bhattacharya 2019 tension leg platform tlp concept would be promising for fopts because the limited platform motion are expected to reduce the loads on tower and transmission conductor compared to other floating concepts without requiring the large draft of a spar or spread mooring system of a semi submersible in this study design and dynamic analysis of a tlp based fopts are considered unlike to onshore power transmission that the reliability of system mainly lies on the dynamics of the conductor desai et al 1995 the feasibility of an fopts would be largely dependent on the interaction between floating towers and conductors 41 have demonstrated that the characteristics of a floating tower would vary significantly from their pre designed value if conductors are rigidly connected to floating towers to reduce the coupling effects between floating towers and conductors a sheave mechanism has been proposed to mount one end of conductor on its supportive tower in the study and experimental results demonstrated that the natural frequencies of the floating tower become insensitive to the conductor the study provides some pioneering investigation on fopts however the design criteria and dynamical response of the system under ocean environments have not been discussed this paper is to extend the previous study at first a mathematical optimization approach is proposed to design the properties of floating towers and conductors the placement of the system s natural frequencies is taken into account in the design to avoid first order wave excitation then a numerical model is presented to study the aero hydro elastic dynamics of fopts with emphasis on the wind wave misalignment finally the design of a moderate fopts is presented and the fully coupled time domain simulation is studied in the following sections several of the specifications referred to an inertial reference frame and platform degrees of freedom dofs are used the letters x y and z represent the orthogonal axes of the inertial reference frame with the x y plane designating the still water level swl and the z axis directed upward along the centerline of the tower the x axis is coincident with the transmission lines and the y axis is determined by the right hand rule positive surge is defined along the positive x axis sway is along the y axis and heave is along the z axis positive roll is defined about the positive x axis pitch is about y axis and yaw is about z axis 2 parametric design submerged tlps are considered as the supportive platforms for fopts because they have large water plane area for self stabilization during transportation and small water plane area for reducing wave loads during operation the platform is of triangular shape since it would save materials for both hull and tethers and the foundation could be placed with larger tolerances compared to a four legged tlp chandrasekaran and jain 2002 the overview of a floating tower is shown in fig 2 the anchor is a gravity anchor however a suction pile a driven pile or any other anchoring means may also be used depending on seabed conditions synthetic fiber ropes such as kevlar ropes are considered as the tendons since they are light and can retain strength even when wet henderson et al 2010 the platform is placed that one of its lines of symmetry is in parallel with the transmission lines tubular steel towers are applied for supporting the transmission lines since they are proved to be robust for fowt stavridou et al 2018 on the tower top a sheave is applied as the intermediate mechanism between the tower and one end of conductor another end of the conductor is connected to an adjacent tower rigidly a weight set is applied to strain the conductor and the mass of the weight set so as the conductor tension is considered to be adjustable in response to external aero loads by the consideration the sag of the conductor would be limited within a safe value even in harsh environments in practical situation a pulley block would be applied to reduce the mass of the weight set and one example is illustrated in fig 2 2 1 design criteria for tlp considering the critical case that the wind travels in the perpendicular direction of the transmission lines as shown in fig 3 the following equations are held according to static force analysis 1 3 f 0 sin α f a c f a t 2 3 f 0 cos α ρ w g v s m t g 3 δ f l 0 cos α m a where ρ w is the water density g the gravitational acceleration α the tilt angle at tendon connector v s and m t the displacement and mass of the floating tower respectively l 0 the distance between tendons f 0 1 3 ρ w v s m t g the initial tendon force under still water and windless condition δ f the variation of the tensile force of the upwind tendon and the downwind tendon f a c and f a t the aero load on the conductor and tower respectively and m a the aero moment in static design the elasticity of the tendons and the tilt of the floating tower are not taken into account to avoid snap loads and to prevent the yield strength of the tendons the following critical conditions are required for a tlp bachynski and moan 2012 4 δ f f 0 f p 5 a m κ f 0 σ where f p and κ are safety factors to avoid tlp over turning and tendon snap respectively a m and σ are the cross sectional area and yield strength of tendon one leg respectively for a tlp floating wind turbine the factor κ can be set as κ 2 bachynski and moan 2012 as there are interaction between floating towers and conductors larger safety margin would be necessary and κ is set as κ 2 5 in this study in addition it is normally required that the mean offset of the platform should not exceed 5 of the water depth in order to limit the angle at the tendon connectors chakrabarti 2005 therefore the following condition is also considered during the design 6 tan α f a c f a t ρ w g v s m t g 5 2 2 design criteria for conductor as the transmission conductors have to be carried at a sufficient height from the sea surface the conductor sag between two supportive towers should be kept to a proper value to reduce the conductor material and to avoid extra tower height the design conditions for a conductor would be 7 d d e t t e f e where d and t are the conductor sag and the horizontal component of the conductor tension respectively d e the maximum sag t e and f e the tensile strength and safety ratio of conductor respectively the tension t can be expressed as 8 t w s 2 8 d where w w a 2 w m 2 is the distributed load per unit length on the conductor taking account of the aero load w a and the conductor weight w m 2 3 criteria for system s eigenfrequencies to avoid first order wave excitation the eigenfrequencies of fopts should be taken into account during the design for a tlp based structure the natural frequencies in surge sway and yaw are generally designed in low frequency zone whereas its heave roll and pitch are in high frequency zone bachynski and moan 2012 in addition the vibration modes of conductor would be designed in high frequency zone by reference to onshore overhead power transmission system matsumiya et al 2018 therefore a reasonable placement of the frequencies is demonstrated in fig 4 the term ω t i i x y z ϕ θ ψ in the figure denotes the natural frequency of floating tower in i dof the interval ω l ω h is wave frequency zone ω 0 is the modal wave frequency ω e represents the vibration modes of conductor and ω e l is a bound to separate the natural frequencies of floating tower and the vibration modes of conductor therefore the design criteria for the system to avoid first order wave excitation can be expressed as 9 ω t x y ψ ω l 10 ω h ω t z ϕ θ ω e l 11 ω e 1 ω e l where ω e 1 the first vibration mode of conductor 2 4 parametric approach as the coupling effects between the supportive towers and conductor could be reduced thanks to the sheave mechanism the properties of tlp and the sag of conductor are designed separately by 12 find v p m p i p x y z m a x y z i a x y z a m l 0 subject to conditions 4 5 6 9 10 and 13 find d subject to condition 7 11 where v p m p and i p x y z are the displacement mass and principal moment of inertia of platform respectively m a x y z and i a x y z the added mass and added moment of inertia of the floating tower respectively since the conductor can be regarded as a taut string the first vibration mode of conductor can be expressed by 17 14 ω e 1 1 s t m c π w 8 d m c π where s is the tower span and m c is the conductor mass per unit length for a submerged tlp with small water plane area the uncoupled natural frequencies can be approximated by 18 15 ω t x ρ w g v s m t g m t m a x h ω t y ρ w g v s m t g m t m a y h ω t z 3 k t m t m a z ω t ϕ k t l 0 2 2 i t x i a x ω t θ k t l 0 2 2 i t y i a y ω t ψ ρ w g v s m t g i t z i a z h l 0 2 3 where h and k t are the length and stiffness of the tendon respectively it is noteworthy that the mass of conductor and tendons is regarded to be small compared to the platform and negligible in the design as the conductor tension would be adjusted by tuning the effective mass of the weight set the program 13 can be reduced to the following program by taking account of windless condition and the harshest wind condition 16 maximize d 0 d n subject to w m 8 d 0 m c π ω e l w n 8 d n m c π ω e l t 0 w m s 2 8 d 0 t e f e t n w n s 2 8 d n t e f e d 0 d n d e where d 0 and d n are the sag of conductor under windless condition and harsh wind condition respectively w n is the distributed load on the conductor per unit length under the harsh wind speed this problem can be separated into two linear programming problems and would be effectively solved by iterative methods such as simplex method nelder and mead 1965 in addition in order to find out a solution for the problem 12 the following assumptions are given in advance the volume and mass of the platform increase as the cube of pontoon length l such as that v p a l 3 and m p b l 3 where a and b are constant in addition the radii of gyration of the platform increase linearly with l so that the principal moment of inertia becomes i p i m p l p i 2 i x y z where p i are constant the added mass m a i and added principal moment of inertia i a i i x y z increase linearly with the displacement of the floating tower that m a i ϵ i ρ w v s and i a i ρ w v s l q i 2 respectively the terms ϵ i and q i are the parameters to be designed in practical situation ϵ i and q i can be adjusted in some degree by changing the shape of the pontoons and or mounting fins on the pontoons moreover the distance between the tendons l 0 is also expressed as a function of pontoon length l as l 0 1 ν l where ν is a parameter to be designed ν 0 means the distance between the tendons is smaller than the pontoon length based on the assumptions the program 12 can be re written as the following nonlinear optimization problem 17 minimize l a m subject to f 0 f p m a 1 ν l f a c f a t ρ w g v s m t g 5 2 5 f 0 σ a m ρ w v s m t m t ϵ i ρ w v s g h ω l i x y ρ w v s m t i t z ρ w v s l q z 2 g h 1 ν 2 l 2 3 ω l ω h 3 k t m t ϵ z ρ w v s ω e l ω h 1 2 k t 1 ν 2 l 2 i t i ρ w v s l q i 2 ω e l i x y with variables l a m ϵ x y z q x y z ν the pontoon length l and the cross sectional area a m are set as the objectives to be minimized in order to reduce the cost of tlp this is a constrained multiobjective optimization problem and several algorithms such as the evolutionary algorithms gunantara 2018 can be applied for solving the problem after solving the problem 17 a tlp can be designed based on the pontoon length l and the coefficients ϵ x y z q x y z an example will be illustrated in section 4 3 numerical model of fopts in general the reliability of fopts can be obtained by setting the safety factors f p and f e with large values however the design would be conservative a better alternative is to set the safety factors with some proper values and evaluate the reliability of fopts iteratively by numerical simulation for this purpose a modeling method is presented in the following 3 1 conductor model lumped parameter method which approximates a flexible body as a collection of several discrete flexible units is applied for modeling the conductor one flexible unit comprises two mass elements coupled with joints and the deformation properties of the unit can be possessed by the internal springs and dampers of the joints the overview of the method is shown in fig 5 to capture the deformation modes of the conductor a gimbal joint and a prismatic joint connected in series are applied by the approach each flexible unit has three rotational dofs and one translational dof the spring coefficients set for the joints are obtained by hooke s law 18 k a e a l for axial deformation k r e i l for bending deformation k t g j l for torsional deformation where e g i j and a are the young s modulus shear modulus second moment of sectional area torsional constant and sectional area of the conductor respectively the damping ratio of the joints can generally be assigned according to some benchmark experiments in practical situation the aerodynamic loads on each flexible unit are calculated based on the quasi steady aerodynamics theory 19 d f 1 2 ρ a v rel v rel d c c d d l c where ρ a is the air density v rel the local relative velocity d c the diameter of the conductor c d the drag coefficient and d l c the length of the flexible unit 3 2 sheave model the flexibility provided by the sheave is modeled by a prismatic joint and the schematic view of the modeling is shown in fig 6 the dynamical conductor tension f p can be approximated as 20 f p t m w x w b p x c where m w and x w are the mass and displacement of the weight set respectively b p is the damping coefficient and x c is the travel position of the prismatic joint the displacement x w can be calculated by 21 x w x c x t where x t is the motion of tower top in surge dof 3 3 model of floating tower regarding the floating tower as a rigid body the motion can then be expressed by 12 22 η j η v 23 m r b v c r b v v τ where v r 6 is the velocity vector expressed in the body fixed coordinate frame η r 3 s 3 the position and orientation vector expressed in the inertial reference frame j the frame transformation matrix m r b the rigid body inertia matrix c r b the rigid body coriolis centripetal matrix due to the rotation and τ the vector of external forces and moments that can be written as 24 τ f rad f res f aero f exc f mooring where f rad is the radiation loads f res the restoring loads f aero the aerodynamic loads on the tower f exc the wave excitation loads and f mooring the mooring force by tendons the mooring force f mooring can be expressed as a linear function of tendon displacement by hooke s law the aerodynamic loads f aero are determined by quasi steady aerodynamics theory based on tower diameter drag coefficient and the local relative velocity the restoring loads are calculated by linear model 25 f res ρ g 0 0 a w p z gm t ϕ gm l θ 0 where is the displacement a w p the water plane area z the displacement in heave gm t and gm l the metacentric height in transverse and longitudinal direction respectively ϕ θ ψ the euler angles of the floating tower in addition the radiation load and wave excitation loads considering both first

successive frequencies the wave amplitude of i th wave component γ and φ the amplitude and phase of the first order force raos β the wave direction ϵ the random phase angle d and s are the difference and sum frequency quadratic transfer functions qtfs the operator r x takes the real part of the complex number x the retardation function k can be calculated by 29 k t 2 π 0 b ω cos ω t d ω where b is the linear radiation damping matrix potential flow program such as hydrostar bureau veritas 2016 can be applied to calculate the added mass potential damping first order and second order wave excitation loads 3 4 numerical environment simmechanicstm which is a multi body simulation environment for 3d mechanical systems is used to model the fopts by the toolbox a multi body system can be handled using blocks to represent bodies joints constraints force elements and sensors the system is assembled by simply connecting the ports of the blocks and the equations of motion for the complete mechanical system can be solved efficiently the schematic diagram of the proposed model is shown in fig 7 a coordinate transform block and a 6 dof joint are applied to set the initial position and the motion degrees of freedom of the floating tower respectively the position of the mooring points both on the platform and seabed and the tower top that the conductor is connected to are defined by coordinate transform blocks linear spring damper blocks are applied to connect the mooring points on the platform and seabed to model the tendons as shown in the dashed box in fig 7 the tension of a tendon can be calculated based on the distance displacement of the tendon connectors the aero and hydro loads on the system are implemented by user defined function blocks 4 a numerical study 4 1 static design overhead power transmission for a moderate wind farm with a capacity of 90 mw three phase power transmission under 66 kv is considered the sea depth is h 0 120 m the conductor wire acsr410 mm 2 ampacity 830 a and the optical fiber wire opgw64 mm 2 are applied as the power conductor and ground wire respectively and their properties are listed in table 1 ice accretion which would increase surface roughness and diameter of the conductor is taken into account and the diameter is assigned to increase by 20 the tower height is set as h 0 35 m according to the voltage level of the transmission lines in addition the span between two consecutive towers is set as s 250 m by reference to onshore overhead power transmission system a tubular tower supported by guy wires is applied as the supportive tower and the design aspects of the tower are given in table 2 the radius and the thickness of the tower are assumed to be linearly tapered from the tower base to the tower top the effective density of the steel is taken to be ρ t 8250 kg m 3 which is meant to be an increase above steel s typical value of 7850 kg m 3 to account for paint bolts welds and flanges that are not included in the tower thickness data the resulted mass of the tower is about 9500 kg the mass of the platform is assumed to be mainly distributed on the cylindrical thin pontoons the thickness t and the length l of the pontoons are set to increase linearly with the diameter d p such as that t 0 008 d p and l 5 d p in addition the young s modulus as well as the yield strength of the tendons are set as e m 70 gpa and σ 1 430 mpa respectively a violent typhoon condition is considered and the wind speed for the static design is set as v w 70 m s the designed aero load on the platform is about m a 8 86 1 0 6 nm other parameters for the static design are given in table 3 by the settings the program 16 and 17 can be solved by matlab functions linprog and fgoalattain respectively and the results are given in table 4 note that the constraint functions of the program 17 are non convex so that the solution is a local optimum a conceptual design of the platform is shown in fig 8 heave plates and truncated pontoons are applied for increasing the added mass in heave and yaw dofs the properties of the platform are summarized in table 5 hydrostar bureau veritas 2016 which provides a complete solution of first order problem of wave diffraction and radiation and also the quadratic transfer function qtf of second order wave loads is applied for computing the hydrodynamics of the floating tower the amplitude of the difference frequency qtf in sway and the sum frequency qtf in roll under transverse waves β 90 are shown in fig 9 the difference frequencies are chosen to include the natural frequencies in surge sway and yaw dofs and the sum frequencies include the natural frequencies in heave roll and pitch dofs 4 2 dynamic analysis a system consisting of three floating towers one fixed tower and one floating substation is considered and the overview of the system is shown in fig 10 the floating substation applied in fukushima forward offshore wind farm yoshimoto et al 2018 wright et al 2020 is applied in the numerical model the transmission lines between two adjacent towers are supposed to be bundled and represented by one single conductor for reducing the computational load the conductor is discretized into 20 flexible units and the damping ratios for linear bending torsional deformation are set as 4 2 1 0 4 n m s 1 0 1 0 1 n m rad s and 7 0 1 0 2 n m rad s respectively according to our previous benchmark experiments 4 2 1 free decay tests free decay tests are performed to study the characteristics of floating tower and conductor for comparison the following three cases are studied case 1 individual floating tower case 2 fopts without using sheaves the ends of conductor are rigidly connected to floating towers case 3 fopts with sheaves in the tests the middle floating tower are initially displaced a little away from their equilibrium position the towers can then oscillate around the equilibrium position whereas the amplitude of the oscillations is gradually reduced with time the motion of the floating tower in surge and pitch are compared in fig 11 as the free decay response in sway heave roll and yaw dofs does not record much difference between the three cases their comparison are not plotted in the figure compared to case 1 it can be found that the oscillation period in case 2 becomes smaller in surge in addition multiple oscillation components are recorded in pitch motion owing to the interaction between towers and conductor however it can be observed from the results of case 3 that the characteristics of the tower motion can almost be maintained when sheaves are applied the natural frequencies of the tower under the three cases are compared in table 6 the response during free decay tests records a similar behavior compared to the experimental tower presented in 41 and therefore the effectiveness of the numerical model is demonstrated moreover hammer test method are applied to study the characteristics of conductor between two consecutive towers and the motion at the middle point of the conductor are recorded and the results are shown in fig 12 it can be found that the out of plane motion of the conductor behaves very similarly between case 2 and case 3 from the simulation results it can be calculated that the first vibration modes are ω ˆ e 1 1 41 rad s which is very close to the theoretical value ω e 1 1 44 rad s by 14 in in plane motion the conductor in case 3 can oscillate with its own vibration mode whereas the conductor in case 2 is highly affected by the supportive towers and moves with multiple vibration components therefore it can be obtained that the coupling effects between the conductor and the supportive towers are reduced by sheaves 4 2 2 fopts in a harsh environment in this section fopts in a harsh environment is studied to evaluate the reliability of the system as the natural frequencies of the fopts are small say within 1 min and therefore short term wind conditions need to be taken into account typhoon sinlaku naval oceanography portal 2008 one of the strongest typhoons near western north pacific ocean area in recent 20 years is considered for reference and the wind speed for the numerical model is set as v w 70 m s the significant wave height and the modal wave period are set as h s 14 m and t 0 16 7 s respectively according to the study on estimation of typhoon generated maximum wave height presented in 14 the waves are generated using the modified pierson moskowitz mpm model fossen 2011 and the wave spectrum is shown as the solid line in fig 13 the wave spectrum of several other sea states are also plotted in the figure for comparison it can be found the harsh sea state under consideration could cover most other sea states and therefore the harsh wave condition would be proper for studying the reliability of fopts the condition that the wind travels in the perpendicular direction of the transmission lines which would be the severest situation is studied four wave directions 0 30 60 90 considering wind wave misalignment are applied to reduce the computational loads the substation is limited to move in horizontal plane and the following 6 order linear model is applied to express the motion raos of the substation 30 g s k s s s 2 2 λ s ω s s ω s 2 k w s s 2 2 λ w ω w s ω w 2 ω p s ω p 2 where ω s and ω w are the natural frequency of the substation and the modal wave frequency respectively the parameters k s λ s k w λ w and ω p are tuned according to the measurements a comparison between the measurement re plotted from 35 and the linear model is shown in fig 14 the linear model would be proper for this study since the motion of the substation is small and shows a linear trend to the wave height wright et al 2019 after the settings the simulation is performed and the statistical characteristics of the floating tower are shown in fig 15 it can be found that the mean motion of the tower is almost insensitive to the wave directions which indicates that the mean tower motion is dominated by the aero loads however the variation of the tower motion in horizontal motion changes remarkably under different wave directions especially a large variation in yaw is induced by the wind wave misalignment in large yaw motion a large deflection angle at the sheave would be caused and the wire which is applied for straining the conductor might be wound during the operation therefore some other method such as improving the triangular platform to reduce the hydrodynamics in yaw dof would be required in practical situation the tendon force under transverse waves wave direction is 90 are shown in fig 16 the simulation results in the beginning 100 s are regarded as the transition state and not plotted in the figure it can be observed that the tendons are in safe operation situation since they are maintained in tight and the tensile force is less than the designed tension force 2 5 f 0 where f 0 1 56 1 0 6 n is the initial tendon tension in addition the normalized power spectral density psd of the tower motion and conductor variation in plane are plotted in fig 17 in comparison with the waves it can be confirmed that the horizontal motion of the tower are dominated by their natural frequencies owing to the fact that when the platform moves periodically away from the equilibrium position the depth of the platform varies accordingly with a double frequency there is a heave vibration mode appeared at 2 ω t y ω t y is the natural frequency in sway dof in addition it can also be observed that the self excited vibration modes of the conductor ω e are suppressed in the harsh wind speed owing to the large aero damping from the results it is noteworthy that the natural frequencies of the tower in roll and pitch dofs vary away from their designed value from 1 38 rad s to 0 98 rad s and 1 38 rad s to 1 10 rad s respectively which violates the design criteria in some level this would be caused by the tendon tilt which decreases the restoring coefficients in roll and pitch in practical situation this problem should be taken into account especially when the ocean currents are taken into account 5 conclusion this paper described a design and numerical modeling method on studying a tlp based fopts the properties of the tlp and the conductor were designed via a mathematical optimization approach the natural frequencies of fopts were taken into account in the design to avoid the first order wave excitation in the model the lumper parameter method was applied to account for the flexibility of the conductor and both the first and second order wave loads were considered in the hydrodynamics an fopts for a sea depth of 120 m was designed practically and the dynamic analysis under a harsh environment was performed by considering the wind wave misalignment from this paper it can be obtained that static design and dynamic analysis would be applicable for studying an fopts to obtain a non conservative design from the results of the example it can be found that the natural frequencies of fopts could be properly designed the tendons could be remained in tight and the tension could be kept within the pre designed value the horizontal shift of the platform under harsh winds would affect the characteristics of the floating tower and the natural frequencies of the tlp might fall into the wave frequency zone this problem should be taken into account especially when ocean currents are considered wind wave misalignment would significantly affect the tower motion in yaw dof the structure of the platform should be improve to reduce the hydrodynamics in yaw so that the affects of wind wave misalignment would be suppressed in general this study provides an initial evaluation on the floating offshore overhead power transmission more studies such as a comprehensive evaluation on platform design in comparison with other platform structures and a study on conductor galloping would be necessary in practical situations credit authorship contribution statement hongzhong zhu conceptualization methodology software experiment writing changhong hu

20421,this study investigates a new dry tree semi submersible platform composed of an upper floating body and a lower pontoon tendons are used to connect these two parts which can rotate freely in roll and pitch in order to release the large wave bending moment to study the motion and tendon performance of the complex multi body system this study uses a combination of numerical simulations and experiments to examine the new platform based on 3d multi body potential theory the numerical calculation results are in good agreement with the experimental results and both results prove that the platform has excellent motion and tendon responses in addition the tendon lengths and lower pontoon weights are further explored and their influences on the motion and tendon responses in the coupled multi body system are obtained it is helpful to increase the length of the tendon for improving the performance of the motion and tendon but the effect of which can be ignored when the length is greater than 100 m the issues concerning the excessive rotation angle and negative load of the tendon can be addressed by changing the weight ratio of the lower pontoon to upper floating body keywords dry tree semi submersible platform coupling multi body system lower pontoon tendon numerical simulation model test 1 introduction at present the floating platforms widely employed in deep water using dry tree systems mainly include the tension leg platform tlp and spar platform however when the water depth exceeds 1500 m the tlp and spar platforms are no longer suitable for dry tree systems liu 2015 therefore for deep sea conditions dry tree systems can be applied in semi submersible platforms this system not only provides the advantages of the dry tree system but can also eliminate the disadvantages of the tlp and spar platforms agbomerie et al 2017 in the meantime it also provides the advantages of a conventional semi submersible platform e g no limits on water depth along with low cost and convenient installation however because a dry tree semi submersible platform mainly adopts a top tension riser ttr the total stroke of the ttr should be limited to less than 10 m kyoung et al 2013 moreover the influencing factor of the riser stroke is mainly the motion of the platform thus the dry tree platform has higher requirements for motion performance the main standard for whether a dry tree system can be adopted is whether the motion response especially the heave amplitude is sufficiently small lim 2009 adding a heave plate to the lower part of a semi submersible platform is one method currently used to improve the motion performance at present the main research methods for semi submersible platforms with heave plates are numerical simulations and model tests a numerical simulation method based on the potential theory can study this type of problem well chen et al 2017 used the morrison equation and three dimensional potential theory to calculate and analyse the motion characteristics of a system comprising a heave plate connecting rods and platform compared with the original platform the new platform had a smaller response spectrum peak and better wave frequency characteristics chen et al 2007 studied the influence of the draft of the heave plate on its effectiveness and proposed suggestions for how to locate the heave plate effectively murray et al 2008 used the volterra equation and a convolution integral to perform the frequency domain calculation and then established a fully coupled hybrid model to obtain the wave excitation force added mass and radiation damping of the platform the drag force component was calculated using the morrison equation the relative velocity between the water particle and platform and the nonlinearity of the global restoring force were considered the viscous effect cannot be directly considered in the potential theory but the heave plate achieves the damping effect by increasing the added mass and fluid damping of the object therefore it is necessary to consider its added viscous mass and viscous damping based on the potential theory the linear method can be used to consider the viscous effect such as adding a critical damping coefficient dnv 2016 as in the sesam developed by dnv teng et al 2010 applied an adaptive gaussian integration method to address viscous damping and high accuracy was achieved with fewer elements an empirical formula for calculating the added viscous mass under the framework of the potential theory was provided and the influence of viscous damping was analysed based on the added mass and radiation damping data obtained by the potential theory as combined with the experimental results of prislin et al 1998 molin and lacaze 2016 calculated the second order slow drift wave motion of a semi submersible platform with and without a heave plate based on the radiation diffraction theory as combined with the morrison and rainey equations in addition a computational fluid dynamics cfd method han et al 2018 and genetic algorithm aubault et al 2007 have also been applied to solve the motion optimisation problem for a semi submersible platform with a heave plate experiments are also often used to study the performance of the platform and to verify the results of numerical simulations li et al 2013a conducted free decay tests to study the added mass coefficient and viscous damping coefficient of heave plates with different opening ratios comparing the hydrodynamic characteristics of heave plates with the same opening ratio and different apertures abuzar et al 2020 studied the hydrodynamic coefficients of single double and triple heave plates under different arrangements and analysed the shadowing effect among multiple heave plates additional researches have been conducted on both numerical simulation and experimental methods srinivasan et al 2005 studied a truss semi submersible platform with multiple heave plates it could effectively reduce the wave excitation force and increase the separated flow damping near the resonant frequency chen et al 2008 also conducted researches on truss semi submersible platforms through analysis prediction and model tests li et al 2013b conducted a series of experiments and compared the results to time domain and linear frequency domain analysis including the added mass and damping coefficient of the platform and heave plate meanwhile the influences of the heave plate on the wave frequency and low frequency motions were discussed jiang et al 2016 analysed the hydrodynamic characteristics of a platform and loads at the joint and studied the sensitivity of the heave plate depth hyung et al 2017 obtained a linear viscous damping through a heave free decay test and applied it to a time domain simulation program liang et al 2018 and jang et al 2019 showed that a heave plate is effective for improving the hydrodynamic performance of a system in the above studies the heave plate and upper floating body of the platform are regarded as a single rigid body and there is no relative motions and rotations between them however there are a considerable coupling effects between the heave plate and upper floating body this will significantly affect the global responses of the system and the response will be concentrated in the components connecting these two parts at present researches on multi body problems mainly focus on conventional horizontal multi bodies the motion responses choi et al 2018 first and second order wave loads peric and swan 2015 pessoa et al 2016 shadowing effect dong et al 2020 and modal motions of connected parts jin et al 2018 chen et al 2020 between horizontally coupled systems have been widely studied currently only a few studies have focused on vertically coupled multi body systems and these studies are limited to numerical simulations based on a three dimensional diffraction theory mansour 2009 considered the coupling effects between the upper floating body and heave plate of a semi submersible platform as a 12 12 stiffness matrix and the first order wave frequency motion and second order slow drift motion of the system were calculated mansour and kumar 2013 determined that the weight of the heave plate is very important to ensure the coupling effects between the systems selecting a heave plate with the appropriate weight ensures that the upper floating body of the platform and heave plate are fully coupled in heave and pitch and avoids negative tensions on the system under extreme environmental conditions peng et al 2018 applied the above design and calculation methods to a floating production storage and offloading system in regards to a dry tree semi submersible platform with a heave plate there are various studies on the motion but relatively few studies have analysed the connection components between the heave plate and upper floating body of the platform jiang et al 2016 performed a sensitivity analysis on the depth heave performance and connection load of the heave plate considerable forces and bending moments were observed at the joints of the heave plate and upper floating body mansour 2009 determined an appropriate weight for a heave plate to ensure that the connecting member is always in a tensioned state peng et al 2018 adjusted the tension state of a connection structure between the upper floating body and heave plate by adjusting parameters such as the length and depth of the heave plate and the size of the middle opening moon pool the specific contents of

the motion performance and tendon performance of the platform under different tendon lengths and pontoon weights the research presented in this paper provides a reference for the optimisation and use of a new vertically coupled multi body dry tree semi submersible platform 2 description of the new platform 2 1 features of the new platform the new dry tree semi submersible platform is aimed at developing the ling shui 17 2 gas field ls17 2 in the south china sea it provides dry oil production gas oil and gas production treatment drilling and workover the designed water depth is 1500 m xie et al 2020 the platform system consists of a conventional deep draft semi submersible platform with four rectangular columns connected by pontoons twelve ttrs and sixteen chain polyester chain mooring lines are also applied a large area lower pontoon is used to reduce the vertical motions of the platform eight tendons are used to connect the upper floating body and lower pontoon these tendons apply steel pipe structures similar to the tlp tendons the tendon porches are utilized as flexible connectors at the top and bottom connection points the tendon can rotate freely in roll and pitch so the upper floating body and lower pontoon form a vertically coupling system through the tendons the main structure type of the platform is shown in fig 1 the heave plate of the platform has a large area and weight and is equipped with ballast water in this study it is called the lower pontoon for reducing the heave motions moreover a lower pontoon with proper weight is needed to ensure that the connecting tendons can always be in a state of tension the self installation of the lower pontoon and in service replacement of the connecting member can be realised by adjusting the weight of the ballast water the arrangement of the tendons ttrs and mooring system is shown in fig 2 2 2 specific parameters and definition of coordinates three coordinate systems are used in this study as shown in fig 3 one is the global coordinate system o x y z the other two are local systems o 1 x 1 y 1 z 1 and o 2 x 2 y 2 z 2 fixed at the bottom of the upper floating body and lower pontoon respectively and the main parameters are listed in table 1 there are thirteen cases in this study as shown in table 2 the influences of the length of tendon are studied maintaining the weight of the upper floating body and lower pontoon unchanged the length of tendon ranges from 20 m to 140 m and the length adjustment factor is 20 m cases 01 07 the weight of the upper floating body and lower pontoon are also studied under the premise of keeping the length of the tendon and the total weight of the platform unchanged taking the upper floating body as an example the weight ranges from 62550 mt to 81750 mt with an adjustment factor of 3200 mt referring to cases 08 13 and case 05 it is assumed that the centre of gravity cog and gyradius of the upper floating body and lower pontoon remain unchanged in cases 08 13 3 numerical modeling based on the potential theory this paper uses a combination of frequency domain analysis and time domain analysis to study the new dry tree semi submersible platform the frequency domain analysis is performed with hydrod and time domain simulations are conducted in orcaflex the methodology adopted for building the two numerical models is described in this section 3 1 frequency domain modeling method based on the linear potential theory the hydrodynamic coefficients of the platform system are derived in the software hydrod by solving the multi body radiation diffraction problem dnv 2018 the panel models of the two parts of the platform are shown in fig 4 with mass parameters listed in table 1 respectively an obvious feature of the multi body system is that the influences of the connecting member on the system need to be considered the displacement expression of the connection point between the tendon l i and upper floating body is liu et al 2014 zheng 2018 1 u i h n i h u h where n i h is the displacement transfer function of the connection point between the tendon l i and upper floating body u h is 6 dof displacements of the upper floating body similarly the displacement expression of the connection point between the tendon l i and lower pontoon is u i p n i p u p where u p is 6 dof displacements of the lower pontoon it is assumed that the force and deformation satisfy hooke s law the relative displacement of the upper floating body and lower pontoon causes the deformation of the tendon thus producing force 2 f i k i δ u i where k i is the stiffness matrix of tendon l i δ u i is the relative displacement between the upper floating body and lower pontoon at l i 3 δ u i n i h u h n i p u p t i u h u p 1 0 0 0 z i h y i h 1 0 0 0 z i p y i p 0 1 0 z i h 0 x i h 0 1 0 z i p 0 x i p 0 0 1 y i h x i h 0 0 0 1 y i p x i p 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 the force produced by the tendon l i to upper floating body is 4 f i h n i h t f i n i h t k i t i u h u p similarly the force produced by the tendon l i to lower pontoon is f i p n i p t k i t i u h u p by combining the two equations the force matrix generated by the tendon l i to dry tree semi submersible platform system is 5 f i h f i p t i t k i t i u h u p with a total of eight tendons the stiffness matrix connecting the displacement and force of the upper floating body and lower pontoon is obtained 6 k i 1 8 t i t k i t i k i can be expressed as 7 k i k i x k i y k i z k i y y k i x x k i z z it is assumed that eight tendons bear the average weight of lower pontoon in the water because the horizontal displacement is small it can be roughly estimated that the force acting on the tendon in the horizontal direction meanwhile the relative horizontal displacement between the upper floating body and lower pontoon is so small that it can be assumed to be zero so 8 k i x k i y g w 8 l k i z k where l is the tendon length g w is the weight of the lower pontoon in the water k is the axial stiffness of the tendon which is listed in table 4 eight tendons are arranged symmetrically so the vertical relative displacement is limited that is the roll and pitch motions are limited on the other hand the relative displacement of the upper floating body and lower pontoon in the x and y directions will lead to the incline of the tendon and the bending moment of connection point so 9 k i x x k i yy m l k i z z m where m is the stiffness of tendon connection point in this study m 100 kn m deg as designed by considering the coupling stiffness matrix of the tendons the upper floating body and the lower pontoon form a vertically coupled twin body system thus the hydrodynamic coefficients obtained in frequency domain have included both the hydrodynamic interaction between the two bodies as well as the vertical coupling stiffness in addition the second order wave force is calculated by the pressure integration method in the frequency domain simulation dnv 2010 the second order free surface model is shown in fig 5 the dissipation of fluid viscosity is neglected in hydrod which is based on the linear potential theory viscous effects are important for offshore platforms with large heave plate and need to be accurately considered therefore critical damping is added to the frequency domain model lee 2008 hu et al 2017 free decay tests and corresponding numerical validations were carried out to obtain more accurate critical damping coefficients which will be discussed in section 5 1 3 2 time domain modeling method the coupled equation for motion in the time domain can be expressed as follow 10 m a x t 0 t r t τ x τ d τ c x t f t where m is the mass matrix of the floating body a is the added mass matrix at infinite frequency r t τ is the matrix of the retardation function representing the memory effect of the fluid which can be derived using the added mass or potential damping matrix obtained from the frequency domain calculation c is the hydrostatic restoring force matrix f t is the external force matrix including the first order wave frequency force f 1 st the second order wave drift force f 2 nd wind force f w current force f c mooring line force f m etc f w and f c are calculated by ocimf formula orcina 2015 the wind and current load coefficients are listed in table 3 which are obtained from the previous wind tunnel tests lines are represented by a lumped mass model orcina 2015 as such the line is modeled as a series of lumps of mass joined together by massless springs the motion and tension of the entire line are obtained by solving the kinematics equations for each segment the chain and rope type of line module are used in the simulation of mooring line and the homogeneous type of line module is used in the simulation of tendon and ttr according to their physical characteristics the connection of tendon with the upper floating body and lower pontoon can rotate freely in roll and pitch and the connection stiffness is 100 kn m deg as designed the main parameters of tendon ttr and mooring line are shown in table 4 the time domain model of dry tree semi submersible platform is established in orcaflex as shown in fig 6 and the upper floating body and lower pontoon are combined into a multi body group the calculation results of the multi body model in the frequency domain simulation are inputted into the multi body group in the time domain specifically the added mass potential damping and hydrostatic restoring force matrix in eqn 10 are all imported by the results of frequency domain calculation in addition because the viscous damping of the lower pontoon is relatively large it needs to be further considered in time domain simulation it is difficult to determine the viscous damping of the lower pontoon accurately which has a large area and weight therefore based on previous experience jiang et al 2016 lu et al 2017 cfd simulation software star ccm is used to estimate the viscous damping of lower pontoon the current velocity is set as 1 0 m s by monitoring the resistance value the damping coefficient of lower pontoon is calculated using the following formula 11 f d 1 2 ρ c d a v 2 where f d is the resistance of the lower pontoon ρ is the density of fluid c d is the damping coefficient a is the drag area v is the velocity of fluid eventually it is determined that the horizontal damping coefficient of the lower pontoon is 1 0 and the vertical damping coefficient is 4 0 and then 6d buoy is used to consider the viscous damping coefficient of the lower pontoon in orcaflex whose weight and volume are set to be infinitely small and the drag area and damping coefficient of the lower pontoon are inputted to the 6d buoy at the same time 4 model test to verify the accuracy of the numerical simulation method model tests were conducted in the wave basin of the state key laboratory of ocean engineering of shanghai jiao tong university the wave basin was 50 m long 40 m wide and 10 m deep the scale was selected as 1 60 as shown in fig 7 the specific environmental condition parameters are shown in table 5 the designed operating condition and survival condition of the new platform are the 1 year and 100 year sea conditions respectively in the design of the sea conditions winds waves and currents are collinear and the random wave component is described by the joint north sea wave project jonswap spectrum the two key parts in the model test were the tendons and lower pontoon there were eight tendons between the upper floating body of the platform and lower pontoon and the upper and lower ends of the tendon adopted universal rotary joints respectively the rotation damping was reduced as much as possible tendons and sensors are shown in fig 8 in addition the model required good structural strength owing to the deep depth at which the lower pontoon was located meanwhile water tight measures were taken to resist water pressure and maintain water tight performance in the experiment the wind field was simulated in the form of a steady wind the wave simulation was realised by adjusting the amplitude and period of the wave maker at the bow of the platform the elevation and period were measured and recorded with a resistance wave probe the current was simulated by an integral stratified current generation system equipped with the wave basin to simulate the shear velocity profile under typhoon conditions the surface velocity of the velocity profile met the velocity requirements of the relevant marine environmental conditions the comparison between the design current velocity curve and measured current velocity curve is shown in fig 9 5 results and discussion 5 1 free decay results the hydrostatic free decay tests include heave pitch and roll tests the purposes of the experiments are to force the decay motion of the system in a certain direction of motion to measure the hydrodynamic parameters such as the natural period of motion and linear damping coefficient of the system the natural properties of the system can be obtained through free decay tests and the results are used to verify the accuracy of the numerical calculations the natural period is calculated based on the average value of several continuous periods of the free decay test and the damping coefficient is calculated as the ratio between the two continuous amplitudes of the wave crest or trough as obtained by a single dof decay test the natural periods and linear damping coefficients obtained by the three hydrostatic decay tests are shown in table 6 table 7 shows the natural periods of the platform as obtained by the numerical simulation and test of case 05 as can be seen from table 6 the new semi submersible platform with lower pontoon increases its natural periods of motions compared with the conventional semi submersible platform as such the range of common wave periods can be avoided to obtain a small heave response such effect is also confirmed by figs 13 and 14 in section 5 2 it should be indicated that the heave free decay test in the wave basin was based on relatively small initial motion amplitude actual value 1 02 m the damping coefficient is closely related to the motion amplitude in the 100 year sea condition the maximum heave response of the platform is approximately 2 30 m which leads the critical damping from the previous free decay test inaccurate and viscous effects may be important for offshore platforms with large heave plate especially in heave in this case the heave free decay test was performed in orcaflex under 2 30 m of the initial motion amplitude it is determined that the heave critical damping coefficient of the platform is 0 069 meanwhile the heave free decay test with 1 02 m of the initial motion amplitude was also conducted in orcaflex and heave decay curves of the numerical and experimental results are compared in fig 10 5 2 response amplitude operators raos the rao curves of the platform are shown in fig 11 the numerical simulation results for surge and heave are in good agreement with the experimental results but the pitch and roll raos deviate slightly this is mainly because the raos obtained by the experiment have a large amplitude when the wave period is approximately 25 s but the raos obtained by the numerical simulation do not show such a trend the reason for this deviation may be that the upper floating body and lower pontoon are connected by tendons and there is a considerable coupling effect in the pitch and roll motions when the wave period is approximately 25 s the rao curves of the lower pontoon are obtained by numerical simulation as shown in fig 12 the natural periods of pitch and roll of the lower pontoon are approximately 25 s i e exactly where the deviation occurs in fig 11 c and d owing to the functional limitations of the software maybe the non synchronisation of the motion between the upper floating body and lower pontoon is not fully considered only by the coupling stiffness matrix in the frequency domain calculation thus the time domain calculation can compensate for the deficiency of this result the considerable coupling between the upper floating body and lower pontoon will be analysed in a later research work although there are inconsistencies between the numerical simulation raos and experimental raos the natural periods of pitch and roll obtained by the two methods are identical ensuring the accuracy of the numerical simulation results to a certain extent the heave motion performance of the new platform is particularly significant to highlight the role of the lower pontoon in increasing the natural period of the heave motion of the platform the rao curves and heave added mass of the platform with or without a pontoon are calculated by numerical simulation as shown in figs 13 and 14 as can be seen from these figures the existence of the lower pontoon greatly increases the heave added mass of the platform thereby prolonging the heave natural period and achieving the purpose of effectively restraining the heave motion of the platform 5 3 motions 5 3 1 numerical and experimental results the time domain nonlinear analysis and model test for case 05 are conducted under the sea conditions ss 1 ss 6 listed in table 5 the extreme values and standard deviations of the surge heave and pitch motions of the platform are calculated as shown in table 8 in addition to highlight the heave and pitch performance of the platform the numerical and experimental heave response frequency spectrum curves are compared as shown in fig 15 because the heave motion is very small in ss 1 and ss 4 the numerical results deviate slightly from the experimental results in the low frequency region but the heave response frequency spectrum curves are in good agreement with each other as a whole in other sea conditions the numerical results are in good agreement with the frequency spectra of the experimental results as shown in fig 16 the pitch response frequency spectrum curves are also in good agreement with each other figs 15 and 16 and table 8 show that the numerical results are basically consistent with the experimental results it indicates that the combination of the frequency domain and time domain methods is reliable which can correctly reflect the motion response characteristics of the platform as can be seen from table 8 under all sea conditions the maximum values of the surge motion are 57 63 m and 53 78 m in the experiment and numerical analysis respectively in the experiment and numerical analysis the maximum heave responses are 2 26 m and 2 19 m respectively in the experiment and numerical analysis the maximum pitch responses are 2 96 deg and 3 04 deg respectively apparently the platform shows good performance figs 17 19 show the motion time history curves of the platform under the 100 year sea condition as obtained by numerical simulation and experiment and they are in good agreement with each other ss 1 is the operating condition and ss 2 is the survival condition according to the experimental results in table 8 the extreme value of the heave motion is 0 36 m under ss 1 and its standard deviation is only 0 07 therefore the platform shows excellent motion performance ss 3 increases the effects of the wind and current based on ss 2 the extreme values of the surge motion are 18 14 m and 57 63 m in ss 2 and ss 3 respectively and the extreme values of the heave motion are 1 64 m and 2 26 m in ss 2 and ss 3 respectively these indicate that winds and currents have significant influences on the surge and heave motions however the pitch motion shows an opposite trend that is the extreme value of the pitch motion in ss 3 is smaller than that in ss 2 this is because the platform drifts seriously when the wind and current act on the platform and the mooring lines play an important role in limiting the horizontal offset while also limiting the rotation of the platform to a certain extent 5 3 2 influence of tendon length through the exploration it can be known that there are two key parameters among the factors affecting the motion and tendon performance of the new platform they are the length of the tendon i e the depth of the lower pontoon below upper floating body and the weight of the lower pontoon based on the above research the numerical simulation method is mainly used to study these two key parameters further meanwhile some typical cases are selected to conduct the model tests section 5 3 explores the influence of these two parameters on the motion performance of the platform the influence of these two parameters on the performance of tendons are shown in section 5 4 more specifically section 5 3 2 addresses the results from changing the length of the tendon and the results from changing the weight of lower pontoon are discussed in section 5 3 3 the adjustment cases of the length of tendon are listed in table 2 the raos and significant amplitudes of the heave pitch and roll motions of the platform after the change in tendon length are obtained by numerical simulation and experiment fig 20 shows the results for the motion response as obtained by the frequency domain simulation the results for the motion response as obtained by the time domain simulation and experiment are shown in fig 21 an extreme value of motion may be random so the significant amplitude is used to show the influence of tendon length on the heave and pitch motions of the platform as can be seen from fig 20 the heave raos show two peaks the first peak is located in a wave period range of approximately 15 s 20 s i e a conventional wave period range in this range the amplitudes of the heave raos evidently decrease with the increase in the length of the tendon the wave period of the second peak is approximately 28 s 30 s in this range the amplitudes of the heave raos increase with an increase in the length of the tendon as can be seen from fig 21 with the increase of the tendon length the significant amplitude of the heave motion of the platform gradually decreases when the tendon length is 20 m 80 m the heave motion significant amplitude decreases significantly but when the tendon length is more than 100 m the decrease of the heave motion significant amplitude is not apparent in contrast the amplitude variation law of the pitch motion raos is not as uniform as that of the heave motion raos nevertheless it is evident that the natural period of the pitch motion increases with an increase in the tendon length which is helpful for reducing the pitch motion response the significant amplitude of the pitch motion when the tendon length is 40 m is larger than that when the tendon length is 20 m which can be explained by the result of the frequency domain calculation compared with the tendon length of 20 m the natural period of the pitch motion does not change when the tendon length is 40 m but the amplitude of the raos evidently increases resulting in a larger pitch motion as the length of the tendon continues to increase i e the natural period of the pitch motion continues to increase the response of the pitch motion continues to decrease which can also be confirmed from fig 21 b therefore it can be inferred that increasing the tendon length is helpful for reducing the heave and pitch response of the operating platform in a conventional wave period but the effect of increasing the tendon length on the motion performance of the platform can be ignored when the tendon length is greater than 100 m this point is also related to the water wave theory according to the water wave theory the issue can be approximated as an infinite water depth issue when the water depth is greater than 207 m under these sea conditions considering that the draft of the upper floating body is 36 m and the height of the lower pontoon is 4 m the fluctuation of the water surface no longer affects its motion when the depth of the pontoon below the upper floating body is more than 167 m accordingly the influence of the lower pontoon on the motion performance of the platform weakens with the increase in the placement depth 5 3 3 influence of weight ratio of lower pontoon to upper floating body this section presents the results regarding the weight change of the lower pontoon the adjustment cases of the weight of tendon are listed in table 2 and the weight ratios of lower pontoon to upper floating body are shown in table 9 the raos and significant amplitudes of the heave pitch and roll motions of the platform after the change in the tendon length are obtained by numerical simulations and experiments fig 22 shows the rao results obtained by the frequency domain simulation the motion results obtained by the time domain simulation and experiments are shown in fig 23 as in section 5 3 2 the significant amplitude is used to show the influence of the change in the weight ratio γ on the heave and pitch motions of the platform as can be seen from fig 22 the raos of the heave motion of the platform do not change with the decrease in the weight ratio γ this is because the geometry of the platform does not change in particular the projection area in the heave direction does not change as such adjusting the weight distribution of the upper floating body and lower pontoon will not affect the heave response from the time domain and experimental results of fig 23 it can be seen that the significant amplitude of the heave motion does not change with the decrease in γ the natural period of the pitch motion of the platform increases with a decrease in the weight ratio γ whereas the amplitudes of the pitch motion raos change slightly this shows that when the sum of the weight of the lower pontoon and upper floating body remains unchanged the smaller the weight of the lower pontoon the better the pitch performance of the platform the significant amplitude of the pitch motion decreases with the decrease in the weight ratio γ as shown in fig 23 however the variation amplitude of the pitch response with the change in the weight ratio γ is significantly less than that of the tendon length generally speaking changing the weight ratio γ has little effect on the motion performance of the platform and the adjustment of the weight distribution ratio of the lower pontoon to upper floating body is mainly for improving the rotation angle and mechanical performance of the tendon as discussed in section 5 4 5 4 rotation angle and tension of tendon 5 4 1 numerical and experimental results in the experiment an underwater inclinometer was installed on a 5 tendon to represent the rotation angle characteristics of the tendon tension sensors and three component force sensors were installed at the upper joints of all tendons to fully reflect the stress characteristics of the tendons table 10 shows the statistical values for the rotation angle and tension of the tendon as obtained for case 05 through experiments and numerical simulations under the sea conditions ss 1 ss 6 as shown in table 10 except for the error of the minimum tension of the tendons in ss 3 the other experimental results for rotation angle and tension are in good agreement with the numerical results thereby fully illustrating the reliability of the numerical simulation method with regard to the error of the minimum tension of the tendon in ss 3 as the minimum is a single valley in a single simulation process randomness occurs inevitably after finding the error of this data the standard deviations of the minimum tension in the experiment and numerical simulation are determined as 3379 55 kn and 2895 59 kn respectively the error is within the acceptable range it can be seen from table 10 that the maximum values of the rotation angle and tension of the tendons in ss 3 head on wave are larger than those in ss 6 oblique wave the minimum value of the tension is even smaller therefore to highlight the performance of the tendons under extreme sea conditions fig 24 only shows the curves of the rotation angle tension and wave bending moment of the tendons as obtained by the numerical simulation in ss 3 the numerical simulation results show that the rotation angle and tension of the tendon are uniformly distributed along the length and that there are no extreme values of rotation angle and tension in a certain place in contrast there is an evident difference in the length distribution of the wave bending moment of the tendon two ends of the tendon have a larger bending moment response which is caused by the relative motion of the upper floating body and lower pontoon when they move relative to each other under the action of winds waves and currents the two ends of the tendon are affected first so they have a larger bending moment response however the maximum bending moment response is only approximately 2000 kn m i e three orders of magnitude less than that obtained by jiang et al 2016 therefore the new platform can also show excellent performance in terms of the tendon performance 5 4 2 influence of tendon length the following two sections explores the effects of the length of the tendon and weight of the lower pontoon on the performance of the tendon section 5 4 2 concerns the research results from changing the length of the tendon the results from changing the weight of the lower pontoon are discussed in section 5 4 3 the specific parameters are set as shown in table 2 there are a total of eight tendons in the later analysis it is neither necessary to discuss each tendon in detail therefore a preliminary analysis through the calculation results is conducted first selecting a representative tendon for further research taking the case 05 and sea condition ss 3 as an example the rotation angles and tension distributions of the eight tendons are analysed as shown in fig 25 as can be seen from fig 25 the extreme rotation angles of the eight tendons are all 13 3 deg 13 4 deg and the distribution is uniform there is no phenomenon in which the rotation angle of a certain tendon is particularly large in columns 3 6 the minimum value of tension of the tendon is small that is a negative load can easily occur it can be determined that the negative load phenomenon is more likely to occur among tendons facing the waves the tendon arrangement is shown in fig 2 therefore a tendon facing the wave is selected as an example to study the influence of the length of the tendon on the rotation angle and tension of the tendon the rotation angle and tension of the tendon in ss 3 are shown in fig 26 as shown in fig 26 when the length of the tendon is 20 m or 40 m a negative load appears in the tendon and the rotation angle and maximum tension are too large with an increase in the length of the tendon the maximum values of the rotation angle and tension show a decreasing trend meanwhile the minimum value of the tension shows an increasing trend that is it gradually deviates from the phenomenon of the negative load when the length of the tendon is more than 100 m the curve of the maximum tension tends to be smooth and the improvement effect of increasing the length of the tendon on the maximum value of the rotation angle and minimum value of the tension is gradually weakened 5 4 3 influence of weight ratio of lower pontoon to upper floating body this section discusses the results from changing the weights of the lower pontoon and upper floating body as interpreted above taking the wave facing tendon as an example the influences of a change in the weight ratio γ on the rotation angle and tension of the tendon are studied the results are shown in fig 27 the sea condition ss 3 is used in this section it can be seen from fig 27 that when the weight ratio γ 0 6 the maximum value of the rotation angle of the tendon is approximately 13 deg and when the weight ratio γ 0 6 the maximum value of the rotation angle of the tendon gradually decreases the maximum and minimum values of the tension of the tendons decrease with a decrease in the weight ratio γ the decreasing trends of the maximum rotation angle and maximum tension of the tendon are beneficial to the platform however the gradual decrease in the minimum value of the tension makes the tendon more prone to negative load from the numerical results it can be inferred that a negative load phenomenon will occur in the tendon when γ 0 54 therefore reducing the weight ratio γ can not only reduce the maximum tension but can also reduce the rotation angle of the tendon to a certain extent however the load of tendons will be prone to be negative consequently it is necessary to comprehensively consider the rotation angle of the tendon and the maximum and minimum values of the tension in order to appropriately set the weight of the lower pontoon and upper floating body in engineering practice the weight ratio γ can be increased as much as possible on the premise of meeting production demands aiming to keep the tendon away from the negative load phenomenon in the production process 6 concluding remarks the new dry tree semi submersible production platform investigated in this study has a deep draft and large area lower pontoon so it can restrain the heave response another advantage of the new platform is that the upper floating body and lower pontoon are connected by tendons thereby forming an interactive coupling system the tendons can rotate around the connection point and release the massive bending moment caused by the inertia force of the lower pontoon thereby improving the motion performance of the platform in this study the motion and tendon performance of the new vertically coupled semi submersible platform are studied based on numerical calculations and model tests the influence rules of the platform motion response tendon rotation angle and tension under different conditions for the lower pontoon placement depth and weight are studied the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the existence of the lower pontoon greatly increases the heave added mass of the platform prolonging the heave natural period and achieving the purpose of effectively restraining the heave motion of the platform in addition to having a small heave response the new platform also has small surge and pitch responses in extreme sea conditions showing excellent motion performance 2 the two key issues potentially occurring in the tendon concern the negative load and excessive rotation angle and are solved based on numerical simulation the rotation performance of the tendon is greatly improved the maximum value of the rotation angle is approximately 13 deg in the 100 year sea condition with winds waves and currents and the negative load phenomenon of the tendon is basically eliminated corresponding model tests are conducted to explore and verify the results 3 it is helpful to increase the length of the tendon for improving the heave and pitch responses of the operating platform in the conventional wave period range with the increase in the length of the tendon the maximum values of the rotation angle and tension tend to decrease and the tendon gradually moves away from the negative load phenomenon however the effect of increasing the tendon length on improving the performance of the motion and tendon can be ignored when the tendon length is greater than 100 m 4 changing the weight ratio of the lower pontoon to upper floating body has little effect on the motion performance of the platform the decrease in the weight ratio γ not only reduces the maximum tension of the tendon but also reduces the rotation angle of the tendon to a certain extent however in the meantime the tendon becomes more prone to negative load therefore it is necessary to comprehensively consider the rotation angle of the tendon and maximum and minimum values of the tension to appropriately set the weight of the lower pontoon and upper floating body in engineering practice the weight ratio γ can be increased as much as possible on the premise of meeting production demands aiming to keep the tendon away from the negative load phenomenon in the production process credit authorship

20421,this study investigates a new dry tree semi submersible platform composed of an upper floating body and a lower pontoon tendons are used to connect these two parts which can rotate freely in roll and pitch in order to release the large wave bending moment to study the motion and tendon performance of the complex multi body system this study uses a combination of numerical simulations and experiments to examine the new platform based on 3d multi body potential theory the numerical calculation results are in good agreement with the experimental results and both results prove that the platform has excellent motion and tendon responses in addition the tendon lengths and lower pontoon weights are further explored and their influences on the motion and tendon responses in the coupled multi body system are obtained it is helpful to increase the length of the tendon for improving the performance of the motion and tendon but the effect of which can be ignored when the length is greater than 100 m the issues concerning the excessive rotation angle and negative load of the tendon can be addressed by changing the weight ratio of the lower pontoon to upper floating body keywords dry tree semi submersible platform coupling multi body system lower pontoon tendon numerical simulation model test 1 introduction at present the floating platforms widely employed in deep water using dry tree systems mainly include the tension leg platform tlp and spar platform however when the water depth exceeds 1500 m the tlp and spar platforms are no longer suitable for dry tree systems liu 2015 therefore for deep sea conditions dry tree systems can be applied in semi submersible platforms this system not only provides the advantages of the dry tree system but can also eliminate the disadvantages of the tlp and spar platforms agbomerie et al 2017 in the meantime it also provides the advantages of a conventional semi submersible platform e g no limits on water depth along with low cost and convenient installation however because a dry tree semi submersible platform mainly adopts a top tension riser ttr the total stroke of the ttr should be limited to less than 10 m kyoung et al 2013 moreover the influencing factor of the riser stroke is mainly the motion of the platform thus the dry tree platform has higher requirements for motion performance the main standard for whether a dry tree system can be adopted is whether the motion response especially the heave amplitude is sufficiently small lim 2009 adding a heave plate to the lower part of a semi submersible platform is one method currently used to improve the motion performance at present the main research methods for semi submersible platforms with heave plates are numerical simulations and model tests a numerical simulation method based on the potential theory can study this type of problem well chen et al 2017 used the morrison equation and three dimensional potential theory to calculate and analyse the motion characteristics of a system comprising a heave plate connecting rods and platform compared with the original platform the new platform had a smaller response spectrum peak and better wave frequency characteristics chen et al 2007 studied the influence of the draft of the heave plate on its effectiveness and proposed suggestions for how to locate the heave plate effectively murray et al 2008 used the volterra equation and a convolution integral to perform the frequency domain calculation and then established a fully coupled hybrid model to obtain the wave excitation force added mass and radiation damping of the platform the drag force component was calculated using the morrison equation the relative velocity between the water particle and platform and the nonlinearity of the global restoring force were considered the viscous effect cannot be directly considered in the potential theory but the heave plate achieves the damping effect by increasing the added mass and fluid damping of the object therefore it is necessary to consider its added viscous mass and viscous damping based on the potential theory the linear method can be used to consider the viscous effect such as adding a critical damping coefficient dnv 2016 as in the sesam developed by dnv teng et al 2010 applied an adaptive gaussian integration method to address viscous damping and high accuracy was achieved with fewer elements an empirical formula for calculating the added viscous mass under the framework of the potential theory was provided and the influence of viscous damping was analysed based on the added mass and radiation damping data obtained by the potential theory as combined with the experimental results of prislin et al 1998 molin and lacaze 2016 calculated the second order slow drift wave motion of a semi submersible platform with and without a heave plate based on the radiation diffraction theory as combined with the morrison and rainey equations in addition a computational fluid dynamics cfd method han et al 2018 and genetic algorithm aubault et al 2007 have also been applied to solve the motion optimisation problem for a semi submersible platform with a heave plate experiments are also often used to study the performance of the platform and to verify the results of numerical simulations li et al 2013a conducted free decay tests to study the added mass coefficient and viscous damping coefficient of heave plates with different opening ratios comparing the hydrodynamic characteristics of heave plates with the same opening ratio and different apertures abuzar et al 2020 studied the hydrodynamic coefficients of single double and triple heave plates under different arrangements and analysed the shadowing effect among multiple heave plates additional researches have been conducted on both numerical simulation and experimental methods srinivasan et al 2005 studied a truss semi submersible platform with multiple heave plates it could effectively reduce the wave excitation force and increase the separated flow damping near the resonant frequency chen et al 2008 also conducted researches on truss semi submersible platforms through analysis prediction and model tests li et al 2013b conducted a series of experiments and compared the results to time domain and linear frequency domain analysis including the added mass and damping coefficient of the platform and heave plate meanwhile the influences of the heave plate on the wave frequency and low frequency motions were discussed jiang et al 2016 analysed the hydrodynamic characteristics of a platform and loads at the joint and studied the sensitivity of the heave plate depth hyung et al 2017 obtained a linear viscous damping through a heave free decay test and applied it to a time domain simulation program liang et al 2018 and jang et al 2019 showed that a heave plate is effective for improving the hydrodynamic performance of a system in the above studies the heave plate and upper floating body of the platform are regarded as a single rigid body and there is no relative motions and rotations between them however there are a considerable coupling effects between the heave plate and upper floating body this will significantly affect the global responses of the system and the response will be concentrated in the components connecting these two parts at present researches on multi body problems mainly focus on conventional horizontal multi bodies the motion responses choi et al 2018 first and second order wave loads peric and swan 2015 pessoa et al 2016 shadowing effect dong et al 2020 and modal motions of connected parts jin et al 2018 chen et al 2020 between horizontally coupled systems have been widely studied currently only a few studies have focused on vertically coupled multi body systems and these studies are limited to numerical simulations based on a three dimensional diffraction theory mansour 2009 considered the coupling effects between the upper floating body and heave plate of a semi submersible platform as a 12 12 stiffness matrix and the first order wave frequency motion and second order slow drift motion of the system were calculated mansour and kumar 2013 determined that the weight of the heave plate is very important to ensure the coupling effects between the systems selecting a heave plate with the appropriate weight ensures that the upper floating body of the platform and heave plate are fully coupled in heave and pitch and avoids negative tensions on the system under extreme environmental conditions peng et al 2018 applied the above design and calculation methods to a floating production storage and offloading system in regards to a dry tree semi submersible platform with a heave plate there are various studies on the motion but relatively few studies have analysed the connection components between the heave plate and upper floating body of the platform jiang et al 2016 performed a sensitivity analysis on the depth heave performance and connection load of the heave plate considerable forces and bending moments were observed at the joints of the heave plate and upper floating body mansour 2009 determined an appropriate weight for a heave plate to ensure that the connecting member is always in a tensioned state peng et al 2018 adjusted the tension state of a connection structure between the upper floating body and heave plate by adjusting parameters such as the length and depth of the heave plate and the size of the middle opening moon pool the specific contents of this paper are as follows section 2 describes the new vertically coupled multi body dry tree semi submersible platform section 3 introduces the methodology adopted for building the frequency domain and time domain models the model test is introduced in section 4 section 5 analyses and discusses the motion performance of the system the rotation angle and mechanical performance of the tendon and the motion performance and tendon performance of the platform under different tendon lengths and pontoon weights the research presented in this paper provides a reference for the optimisation and use of a new vertically coupled multi body dry tree semi submersible platform 2 description of the new platform 2 1 features of the new platform the new dry tree semi submersible platform is aimed at developing the ling shui 17 2 gas field ls17 2 in the south china sea it provides dry oil production gas oil and gas production treatment drilling and workover the designed water depth is 1500 m xie et al 2020 the platform system consists of a conventional deep draft semi submersible platform with four rectangular columns connected by pontoons twelve ttrs and sixteen chain polyester chain mooring lines are also applied a large area lower pontoon is used to reduce the vertical motions of the platform eight tendons are used to connect the upper floating body and lower pontoon these tendons apply steel pipe structures similar to the tlp tendons the tendon porches are utilized as flexible connectors at the top and bottom connection points the tendon can rotate freely in roll and pitch so the upper floating body and lower pontoon form a vertically coupling system through the tendons the main structure type of the platform is shown in fig 1 the heave plate of the platform has a large area and weight and is equipped with ballast water in this study it is called the lower pontoon for reducing the heave motions moreover a lower pontoon with proper weight is needed to ensure that the connecting tendons can always be in a state of tension the self installation of the lower pontoon and in service replacement of the connecting member can be realised by adjusting the weight of the ballast water the arrangement of the tendons ttrs and mooring system is shown in fig 2 2 2 specific parameters and definition of coordinates three coordinate systems are used in this study as shown in fig 3 one is the global coordinate system o x y z the other two are local systems o 1 x 1 y 1 z 1 and o 2 x 2 y 2 z 2 fixed at the bottom of the upper floating body and lower pontoon respectively and the main parameters are listed in table 1 there are thirteen cases in this study as shown in table 2 the influences of the length of tendon are studied maintaining the weight of the upper floating body and lower pontoon unchanged the length of tendon ranges from 20 m to 140 m and the length adjustment factor is 20 m cases 01 07 the weight of the upper floating body and lower pontoon are also studied under the premise of keeping the length of the tendon and the total weight of the platform unchanged taking the upper floating body as an example the weight ranges from 62550 mt to 81750 mt with an adjustment factor of 3200 mt referring to cases 08 13 and case 05 it is assumed that the centre of gravity cog and gyradius of the upper floating body and lower pontoon remain unchanged in cases 08 13 3 numerical modeling based on the potential theory this paper uses a combination of frequency domain analysis and time domain analysis to study the new dry tree semi submersible platform the frequency domain analysis is performed with hydrod and time domain simulations are conducted in orcaflex the methodology adopted for building the two numerical models is described in this section 3 1 frequency domain modeling method based on the linear potential theory the hydrodynamic coefficients of the platform system are derived in the software hydrod by solving the multi body radiation diffraction problem dnv 2018 the panel models of the two parts of the platform are shown in fig 4 with mass parameters listed in table 1 respectively an obvious feature of the multi body system is that the influences of the connecting member on the system need to be considered the displacement expression of the connection point between the tendon l i and upper floating body is liu et al 2014 zheng 2018 1 u i h n i h u h where n i h is the displacement transfer function of the connection point between the tendon l i and upper floating body u h is 6 dof displacements of the upper floating body similarly the displacement expression of the connection point between the tendon l i and lower pontoon is u i p n i p u p where u p is 6 dof displacements of the lower pontoon it is assumed that the force and deformation satisfy hooke s law the relative displacement of the upper floating body and lower pontoon causes the deformation of the tendon thus producing force 2 f i k i δ u i where k i is the stiffness matrix of tendon l i δ u i is the relative displacement between the upper floating body and lower pontoon at l i 3 δ u i n i h u h n i p u p t i u h u p 1 0 0 0 z i h y i h 1 0 0 0 z i p y i p 0 1 0 z i h 0 x i h 0 1 0 z i p 0 x i p 0 0 1 y i h x i h 0 0 0 1 y i p x i p 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 the force produced by the tendon l i to upper floating body is 4 f i h n i h t f i n i h t k i t i u h u p similarly the force produced by the tendon l i to lower pontoon is f i p n i p t k i t i u h u p by combining the two equations the force matrix generated by the tendon l i to dry tree semi submersible platform system is 5 f i h f i p t i t k i t i u h u p with a total of eight tendons the stiffness matrix connecting the displacement and force of the upper floating body and lower pontoon is obtained 6 k i 1 8 t i t k i t i k i can be expressed as 7 k i k i x k i y k i z k i y y k i x x k i z z it is assumed that eight tendons bear the average weight of lower pontoon in the water because the horizontal displacement is small it can be roughly estimated that the force acting on the tendon in the horizontal direction meanwhile the relative horizontal displacement between the upper floating body and lower pontoon is so small that it can be assumed to be zero so 8 k i x k i y g w 8 l k i z k where l is the tendon length g w is the weight of the lower pontoon in the water k is the axial stiffness of the tendon which is listed in table 4 eight tendons are arranged symmetrically so the vertical relative displacement is limited that is the roll and pitch motions are limited on the other hand the relative displacement of the upper floating body and lower pontoon in the x and y directions will lead to the incline of the tendon and the bending moment of connection point so 9 k i x x k i yy m l k i z z m where m is the stiffness of tendon connection point in this study m 100 kn m deg as designed by considering the coupling stiffness matrix of the tendons the upper floating body and the lower pontoon form a vertically coupled twin body system thus the hydrodynamic coefficients obtained in frequency domain have included both the hydrodynamic interaction between the two bodies as well as the vertical coupling stiffness in addition the second order wave force is calculated by the pressure integration method in the frequency domain simulation dnv 2010 the second order free surface model is shown in fig 5 the dissipation of fluid viscosity is neglected in hydrod which is based on the linear potential theory viscous effects are important for offshore platforms with large heave plate and need to be accurately considered therefore critical damping is added to the frequency domain model lee 2008 hu et al 2017 free decay tests and corresponding numerical validations were carried out to obtain more accurate critical damping coefficients which will be discussed in section 5 1 3 2 time domain modeling method the coupled equation for motion in the time domain can be expressed as follow 10 m a x t 0 t r t τ x τ d τ c x t f t where m is the mass matrix of the floating body a is the added mass matrix at infinite frequency r t τ is the matrix of the retardation function representing the memory effect of the fluid which can be derived using the added mass or potential damping matrix obtained from the frequency domain calculation c is the hydrostatic restoring force matrix f t is the external force matrix including the first order wave frequency force f 1 st the second order wave drift force f 2 nd wind force f w current force f c mooring line force f m etc f w and f c are calculated by ocimf formula orcina 2015 the wind and current load coefficients are listed in table 3 which are obtained from the previous wind tunnel tests lines are represented by a lumped mass model orcina 2015 as such the line is modeled as a series of lumps of mass joined together by massless springs the motion and tension of the entire line are obtained by solving the kinematics equations for each segment the chain and rope type of line module are used in the simulation of mooring line and the homogeneous type of line module is used in the simulation of tendon and ttr according to their physical characteristics the connection of tendon with the upper floating body and lower pontoon can rotate freely in roll and pitch and the connection stiffness is 100 kn m deg as designed the main parameters of tendon ttr and mooring line are shown in table 4 the time domain model of dry tree semi submersible platform is established in orcaflex as shown in fig 6 and the upper floating body and lower pontoon are combined into a multi body group the calculation results of the multi body model in the frequency domain simulation are inputted into the multi body group in the time domain specifically the added mass potential damping and hydrostatic restoring force matrix in eqn 10 are all imported by the results of frequency domain calculation in addition because the viscous damping of the lower pontoon is relatively large it needs to be further considered in time domain simulation it is difficult to determine the viscous damping of the lower pontoon accurately which has a large area and weight therefore based on previous experience jiang et al 2016 lu et al 2017 cfd simulation software star ccm is used to estimate the viscous damping of lower pontoon the current velocity is set as 1 0 m s by monitoring the resistance value the damping coefficient of lower pontoon is calculated using the following formula 11 f d 1 2 ρ c d a v 2 where f d is the resistance of the lower pontoon ρ is the density of fluid c d is the damping coefficient a is the drag area v is the velocity of fluid eventually it is determined that the horizontal damping coefficient of the lower pontoon is 1 0 and the vertical damping coefficient is 4 0 and then 6d buoy is used to consider the viscous damping coefficient of the lower pontoon in orcaflex whose weight and volume are set to be infinitely small and the drag area and damping coefficient of the lower pontoon are inputted to the 6d buoy at the same time 4 model test to verify the accuracy of the numerical simulation method model tests were conducted in the wave basin of the state key laboratory of ocean engineering of shanghai jiao tong university the wave basin was 50 m long 40 m wide and 10 m deep the scale was selected as 1 60 as shown in fig 7 the specific environmental condition parameters are shown in table 5 the designed operating condition and survival condition of the new platform are the 1 year and 100 year sea conditions respectively in the design of the sea conditions winds waves and currents are collinear and the random wave component is described by the joint north sea wave project jonswap spectrum the two key parts in the model test were the tendons and lower pontoon there were eight tendons between the upper floating body of the platform and lower pontoon and the upper and lower ends of the tendon adopted universal rotary joints respectively the rotation damping was reduced as much as possible tendons and sensors are shown in fig 8 in addition the model required good structural strength owing to the deep depth at which the lower pontoon was located meanwhile water tight measures were taken to resist water pressure and maintain water tight performance in the experiment the wind field was simulated in the form of a steady wind the wave simulation was realised by adjusting the amplitude and period of the wave maker at the bow of the platform the elevation and period were measured and recorded with a resistance wave probe the current was simulated by an integral stratified current generation system equipped with the wave basin to simulate the shear velocity profile under typhoon conditions the surface velocity of the velocity profile met the velocity requirements of the relevant marine environmental conditions the comparison between the design current velocity curve and measured current velocity curve is shown in fig 9 5 results and discussion 5 1 free decay results the hydrostatic free decay tests include heave pitch and roll tests the purposes of the experiments are to force the decay motion of the system in a certain direction of motion to measure the hydrodynamic parameters such as the natural period of motion and linear damping coefficient of the system the natural properties of the system can be obtained through free decay tests and the results are used to verify the accuracy of the numerical calculations the natural period is calculated based on the average value of several continuous periods of the free decay test and the damping coefficient is calculated as the ratio between the two continuous amplitudes of the wave crest or trough as obtained by a single dof decay test the natural periods and linear damping coefficients obtained by the three hydrostatic decay tests are shown in table 6 table 7 shows the natural periods of the platform as obtained by the numerical simulation and test of case 05 as can be seen from table 6 the new semi submersible platform with lower pontoon increases its natural periods of motions compared with the conventional semi submersible platform as such the range of common wave periods can be avoided to obtain a small heave response such effect is also confirmed by figs 13 and 14 in section 5 2 it should be indicated that the heave free decay test in the wave basin was based on relatively small initial motion amplitude actual value 1 02 m the damping coefficient is closely related to the motion amplitude in the 100 year sea condition the maximum heave response of the platform is approximately 2 30 m which leads the critical damping from the previous free decay test inaccurate and viscous effects may be important for offshore platforms with large heave plate especially in heave in this case the heave free decay test was performed in orcaflex under 2 30 m of the initial motion amplitude it is determined that the heave critical damping coefficient of the platform is 0 069 meanwhile the heave free decay test with 1 02 m of the initial motion amplitude was also conducted in orcaflex and heave decay curves of the numerical and experimental results are compared in fig 10 5 2 response amplitude operators raos the rao curves of the platform are shown in fig 11 the numerical simulation results for surge and heave are in good agreement with the experimental results but the pitch and roll raos deviate slightly this is mainly because the raos obtained by the experiment have a large amplitude when the wave period is approximately 25 s but the raos obtained by the numerical simulation do not show such a trend the reason for this deviation may be that the upper floating body and lower pontoon are connected by tendons and there is a considerable coupling effect in the pitch and roll motions when the wave period is approximately 25 s the rao curves of the lower pontoon are obtained by numerical simulation as shown in fig 12 the natural periods of pitch and roll of the lower pontoon are approximately 25 s i e exactly where the deviation occurs in fig 11 c and d owing to the functional limitations of the software maybe the non synchronisation of the motion between the upper floating body and lower pontoon is not fully considered only by the coupling stiffness matrix in the frequency domain calculation thus the time domain calculation can compensate for the deficiency of this result the considerable coupling between the upper floating body and lower pontoon will be analysed in a later research work although there are inconsistencies between the numerical simulation raos and experimental raos the natural periods of pitch and roll obtained by the two methods are identical ensuring the accuracy of the numerical simulation results to a certain extent the heave motion performance of the new platform is particularly significant to highlight the role of the lower pontoon in increasing the natural period of the heave motion of the platform the rao curves and heave added mass of the platform with or without a pontoon are calculated by numerical simulation as shown in figs 13 and 14 as can be seen from these figures the existence of the lower pontoon greatly increases the heave added mass of the platform thereby prolonging the heave natural period and achieving the purpose of effectively restraining the heave motion of the platform 5 3 motions 5 3 1 numerical and experimental results the time domain nonlinear analysis and model test for case 05 are conducted under the sea conditions ss 1 ss 6 listed in table 5 the extreme values and standard deviations of the surge heave and pitch motions of the platform are calculated as shown in table 8 in addition to highlight the heave and pitch performance of the platform the numerical and experimental heave response frequency spectrum curves are compared as shown in fig 15 because the heave motion is very small in ss 1 and ss 4 the numerical results deviate slightly from the experimental results in the low frequency region but the heave response frequency spectrum curves are in good agreement with each other as a whole in other sea conditions the numerical results are in good agreement with the frequency spectra of the experimental results as shown in fig 16 the pitch response frequency spectrum curves are also in good agreement with each other figs 15 and 16 and table 8 show that the numerical results are basically consistent with the experimental results it indicates that the combination of the frequency domain and time domain methods is reliable which can correctly reflect the motion response characteristics of the platform as can be seen from table 8 under all sea conditions the maximum values of the surge motion are 57 63 m and 53 78 m in the experiment and numerical analysis respectively in the experiment and numerical analysis the maximum heave responses are 2 26 m and 2 19 m respectively in the experiment and numerical analysis the maximum pitch responses are 2 96 deg and 3 04 deg respectively apparently the platform shows good performance figs 17 19 show the motion time history curves of the platform under the 100 year sea condition as obtained by numerical simulation and experiment and they are in good agreement with each other ss 1 is the operating condition and ss 2 is the survival condition according to the experimental results in table 8 the extreme value of the heave motion is 0 36 m under ss 1 and its standard deviation is only 0 07 therefore the platform shows excellent motion performance ss 3 increases the effects of the wind and current based on ss 2 the extreme values of the surge motion are 18 14 m and 57 63 m in ss 2 and ss 3 respectively and the extreme values of the heave motion are 1 64 m and 2 26 m in ss 2 and ss 3 respectively these indicate that winds and currents have significant influences on the surge and heave motions however the pitch motion shows an opposite trend that is the extreme value of the pitch motion in ss 3 is smaller than that in ss 2 this is because the platform drifts seriously when the wind and current act on the platform and the mooring lines play an important role in limiting the horizontal offset while also limiting the rotation of the platform to a certain extent 5 3 2 influence of tendon length through the exploration it can be known that there are two key parameters among the factors affecting the motion and tendon performance of the new platform they are the length of the tendon i e the depth of the lower pontoon below upper floating body and the weight of the lower pontoon based on the above research the numerical simulation method is mainly used to study these two key parameters further meanwhile some typical cases are selected to conduct the model tests section 5 3 explores the influence of these two parameters on the motion performance of the platform the influence of these two parameters on the performance of tendons are shown in section 5 4 more specifically section 5 3 2 addresses the results from changing the length of the tendon and the results from changing the weight of lower pontoon are discussed in section 5 3 3 the adjustment cases of the length of tendon are listed in table 2 the raos and significant amplitudes of the heave pitch and roll motions of the platform after the change in tendon length are obtained by numerical simulation and experiment fig 20 shows the results for the motion response as obtained by the frequency domain simulation the results for the motion response as obtained by the time domain simulation and experiment are shown in fig 21 an extreme value of motion may be random so the significant amplitude is used to show the influence of tendon length on the heave and pitch motions of the platform as can be seen from fig 20 the heave raos show two peaks the first peak is located in a wave period range of approximately 15 s 20 s i e a conventional wave period range in this range the amplitudes of the heave raos evidently decrease with the increase in the length of the tendon the wave period of the second peak is approximately 28 s 30 s in this range the amplitudes of the heave raos increase with an increase in the length of the tendon as can be seen from fig 21 with the increase of the tendon length the significant amplitude of the heave motion of the platform gradually decreases when the tendon length is 20 m 80 m the heave motion significant amplitude decreases significantly but when the tendon length is more than 100 m the decrease of the heave motion significant amplitude is not apparent in contrast the amplitude variation law of the pitch motion raos is not as uniform as that of the heave motion raos nevertheless it is evident that the natural period of the pitch motion increases with an increase in the tendon length which is helpful for reducing the pitch motion response the significant amplitude of the pitch motion when the tendon length is 40 m is larger than that when the tendon length is 20 m which can be explained by the result of the frequency domain calculation compared with the tendon length of 20 m the natural period of the pitch motion does not change when the tendon length is 40 m but the amplitude of the raos evidently increases resulting in a larger pitch motion as the length of the tendon continues to increase i e the natural period of the pitch motion continues to increase the response of the pitch motion continues to decrease which can also be confirmed from fig 21 b therefore it can be inferred that increasing the tendon length is helpful for reducing the heave and pitch response of the operating platform in a conventional wave period but the effect of increasing the tendon length on the motion performance of the platform can be ignored when the tendon length is greater than 100 m this point is also related to the water wave theory according to the water wave theory the issue can be approximated as an infinite water depth issue when the water depth is greater than 207 m under these sea conditions considering that the draft of the upper floating body is 36 m and the height of the lower pontoon is 4 m the fluctuation of the water surface no longer affects its motion when the depth of the pontoon below the upper floating body is more than 167 m accordingly the influence of the lower pontoon on the motion performance of the platform weakens with the increase in the placement depth 5 3 3 influence of weight ratio of lower pontoon to upper floating body this section presents the results regarding the weight change of the lower pontoon the adjustment cases of the weight of tendon are listed in table 2 and the weight ratios of lower pontoon to upper floating body are shown in table 9 the raos and significant amplitudes of the heave pitch and roll motions of the platform after the change in the tendon length are obtained by numerical simulations and experiments fig 22 shows the rao results obtained by the frequency domain simulation the motion results obtained by the time domain simulation and experiments are shown in fig 23 as in section 5 3 2 the significant amplitude is used to show the influence of the change in the weight ratio γ on the heave and pitch motions of the platform as can be seen from fig 22 the raos of the heave motion of the platform do not change with the decrease in the weight ratio γ this is because the geometry of the platform does not change in particular the projection area in the heave direction does not change as such adjusting the weight distribution of the upper floating body and lower pontoon will not affect the heave response from the time domain and experimental results of fig 23 it can be seen that the significant amplitude of the heave motion does not change with the decrease in γ the natural period of the pitch motion of the platform increases with a decrease in the weight ratio γ whereas the amplitudes of the pitch motion raos change slightly this shows that when the sum of the weight of the lower pontoon and upper floating body remains unchanged the smaller the weight of the lower pontoon the better the pitch performance of the platform the significant amplitude of the pitch motion decreases with the decrease in the weight ratio γ as shown in fig 23 however the variation amplitude of the pitch response with the change in the weight ratio γ is significantly less than that of the tendon length generally speaking changing the weight ratio γ has little effect on the motion performance of the platform and the adjustment of the weight distribution ratio of the lower pontoon to upper floating body is mainly for improving the rotation angle and mechanical performance of the tendon as discussed in section 5 4 5 4 rotation angle and tension of tendon 5 4 1 numerical and experimental results in the experiment an underwater inclinometer was installed on a 5 tendon to represent the rotation angle characteristics of the tendon tension sensors and three component force sensors were installed at the upper joints of all tendons to fully reflect the stress characteristics of the tendons table 10 shows the statistical values for the rotation angle and tension of the tendon as obtained for case 05 through experiments and numerical simulations under the sea conditions ss 1 ss 6 as shown in table 10 except for the error of the minimum tension of the tendons in ss 3 the other experimental results for rotation angle and tension are in good agreement with the numerical results thereby fully illustrating the reliability of the numerical simulation method with regard to the error of the minimum tension of the tendon in ss 3 as the minimum is a single valley in a single simulation process randomness occurs inevitably after finding the error of this data the standard deviations of the minimum tension in the experiment and numerical simulation are determined as 3379 55 kn and 2895 59 kn respectively the error is within the acceptable range it can be seen from table 10 that the maximum values of the rotation angle and tension of the tendons in ss 3 head on wave are larger than those in ss 6 oblique wave the minimum value of the tension is even smaller therefore to highlight the performance of the tendons under extreme sea conditions fig 24 only shows the curves of the rotation angle tension and wave bending moment of the tendons as obtained by the numerical simulation in ss 3 the numerical simulation results show that the rotation angle and tension of the tendon are uniformly distributed along the length and that there are no extreme values of rotation angle and tension in a certain place in contrast there is an evident difference in the length distribution of the wave bending moment of the tendon two ends of the tendon have a larger bending moment response which is caused by the relative motion of the upper floating body and lower pontoon when they move relative to each other under the action of winds waves and currents the two ends of the tendon are affected first so they have a larger bending moment response however the maximum bending moment response is only approximately 2000 kn m i e three orders of magnitude less than that obtained by jiang et al 2016 therefore the new platform can also show excellent performance in terms of the tendon performance 5 4 2 influence of tendon length the following two sections explores the effects of the length of the tendon and weight of the lower pontoon on the performance of the tendon section 5 4 2 concerns the research results from changing the length of the tendon the results from changing the weight of the lower pontoon are discussed in section 5 4 3 the specific parameters are set as shown in table 2 there are a total of eight tendons in the later analysis it is neither necessary to discuss each tendon in detail therefore a preliminary analysis through the calculation results is conducted first selecting a representative tendon for further research taking the case 05 and sea condition ss 3 as an example the rotation angles and tension distributions of the eight tendons are analysed as shown in fig 25 as can be seen from fig 25 the extreme rotation angles of the eight tendons are all 13 3 deg 13 4 deg and the distribution is uniform there is no phenomenon in which the rotation angle of a certain tendon is particularly large in columns 3 6 the minimum value of tension of the tendon is small that is a negative load can easily occur it can be determined that the negative load phenomenon is more likely to occur among tendons facing the waves the tendon arrangement is shown in fig 2 therefore a tendon facing the wave is selected as an example to study the influence of the length of the tendon on the rotation angle and tension of the tendon the rotation angle and tension of the tendon in ss 3 are shown in fig 26 as shown in fig 26 when the length of the tendon is 20 m or 40 m a negative load appears in the tendon and the rotation angle and maximum tension are too large with an increase in the length of the tendon the maximum values of the rotation angle and tension show a decreasing trend meanwhile the minimum value of the tension shows an increasing trend that is it gradually deviates from the phenomenon of the negative load when the length of the tendon is more than 100 m the curve of the maximum tension tends to be smooth and the improvement effect of increasing the length of the tendon on the maximum value of the rotation angle and minimum value of the tension is gradually weakened 5 4 3 influence of weight ratio of lower pontoon to upper floating body this section discusses the results from changing the weights of the lower pontoon and upper floating body as interpreted above taking the wave facing tendon as an example the influences of a change in the weight ratio γ on the rotation angle and tension of the tendon are studied the results are shown in fig 27 the sea condition ss 3 is used in this section it can be seen from fig 27 that when the weight ratio γ 0 6 the maximum value of the rotation angle of the tendon is approximately 13 deg and when the weight ratio γ 0 6 the maximum value of the rotation angle of the tendon gradually decreases the maximum and minimum values of the tension of the tendons decrease with a decrease in the weight ratio γ the decreasing trends of the maximum rotation angle and maximum tension of the tendon are beneficial to the platform however the gradual decrease in the minimum value of the tension makes the tendon more prone to negative load from the numerical results it can be inferred that a negative load phenomenon will occur in the tendon when γ 0 54 therefore reducing the weight ratio γ can not only reduce the maximum tension but can also reduce the rotation angle of the tendon to a certain extent however the load of tendons will be prone to be negative consequently it is necessary to comprehensively consider the rotation angle of the tendon and the maximum and minimum values of the tension in order to appropriately set the weight of the lower pontoon and upper floating body in engineering practice the weight ratio γ can be increased as much as possible on the premise of meeting production demands aiming to keep the tendon away from the negative load phenomenon in the production process 6 concluding remarks the new dry tree semi submersible production platform investigated in this study has a deep draft and large area lower pontoon so it can restrain the heave response another advantage of the new platform is that the upper floating body and lower pontoon are connected by tendons thereby forming an interactive coupling system the tendons can rotate around the connection point and release the massive bending moment caused by the inertia force of the lower pontoon thereby improving the motion performance of the platform in this study the motion and tendon performance of the new vertically coupled semi submersible platform are studied based on numerical calculations and model tests the influence rules of the platform motion response tendon rotation angle and tension under different conditions for the lower pontoon placement depth and weight are studied the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the existence of the lower pontoon greatly increases the heave added mass of the platform prolonging the heave natural period and achieving the purpose of effectively restraining the heave motion of the platform in addition to having a small heave response the new platform also has small surge and pitch responses in extreme sea conditions showing excellent motion performance 2 the two key issues potentially occurring in the tendon concern the negative load and excessive rotation angle and are solved based on numerical simulation the rotation performance of the tendon is greatly improved the maximum value of the rotation angle is approximately 13 deg in the 100 year sea condition with winds waves and currents and the negative load phenomenon of the tendon is basically eliminated corresponding model tests are conducted to explore and verify the results 3 it is helpful to increase the length of the tendon for improving the heave and pitch responses of the operating platform in the conventional wave period range with the increase in the length of the tendon the maximum values of the rotation angle and tension tend to decrease and the tendon gradually moves away from the negative load phenomenon however the effect of increasing the tendon length on improving the performance of the motion and tendon can be ignored when the tendon length is greater than 100 m 4 changing the weight ratio of the lower pontoon to upper floating body has little effect on the motion performance of the platform the decrease in the weight ratio γ not only reduces the maximum tension of the tendon but also reduces the rotation angle of the tendon to a certain extent however in the meantime the tendon becomes more prone to negative load therefore it is necessary to comprehensively consider the rotation angle of the tendon and maximum and minimum values of the tension to appropriately set the weight of the lower pontoon and upper floating body in engineering practice the weight ratio γ can be increased as much as possible on the premise of meeting production demands aiming to keep the tendon away from the negative load phenomenon in the production process credit authorship

20422,based on the conditional restricted boltzmann machine deep belief network crbm dbn we select four patterns and compare their prediction effects for the significant wave height in the gulf of mexico gom historical datasets of all 12 buoys managed by the national data buoy center are employed to train and construct models root mean square error rmse and coefficient of efficiency ce between the observed and predicted wave heights are investigated we find that for the short term prediction i e lead time 12 h the best results rmse 0 24 m and ce 0 92 are achieved with the univariate significant wave height as the input in most cases of the whole gulf when the lead time is equal to 24 h or 48 h the multivariate pattern of significant wave height dominant wave direction wind speed wind direction has the optimal effects 0 18 m rmse 0 40 m and 0 72 ce 0 93 in the vicinity of 26 n oceans the superiority is very obvious and gradually diminishes as the latitude increases to the north and decreases to the south regarding the wave height predictions in different oceans of gom the findings provide evidence that it may be contributed to select optimal prediction patterns and obtain the best applications keywords crbm dbn gulf of mexico prediction for the significant wave height univariate and multivariate prediction patterns 1 introduction accurate prediction of wave characteristics is of great significance for many coastal ocean engineering and marine activities contributing factors for the wave are numerous and complicated so far the wave characteristics have not been described exactly and quantitatively by universal and determinate mathematical models it only considers qualitatively that the wave variation is codetermined via many meteorological and oceanic factors such as wave wind etc wave prediction technologies are mainly composed of numerical models such as the wave model wam wamdi group 1988 simulating waves nearshore swan booij et al 1999 ris et al 1999 wavewatch iii ww3 tolman 1989 machine learning methods e g support vector machine svm genetic algorithm ga fuzzy logic fl artificial neural network ann and hybrids of the above two methods numerical methods attempt to forecast waves by mathematical models established approximately for some regional oceans the methods could achieve accurate results but their computational cost is very high machine learning methods only need to know which factors are related to the target physical quantity the prediction processes are that with prediction patterns of univariant or multivariant inputs selected historical information is trained input output prediction models are set up and future waves are forecasted as a kind of important machine learning approach many researchers have focused on taking wind speed significant wave height or its prediction error respectively as the univariant input to train models with the ann or its hybrid methods by using wind speed deo et al 2001 constructed a feed forward neural network with 3 layers and forecasted significant wave height and mean wave period in virtue of ann makarynskyy 2004 londhe and panchang 2006 predicted wave heights in different oceans under the pattern of wind speed wave height malekmohamadi et al 2008 combined ann with numerical models and predicted wave parameters in the lake superior and the pacific ocean under wind speed model tree mt was compared with ann to predict wave height in lake superior etemad shahidi and mahjoobi 2009 with the help of wavelet and ann deka and prahlada 2012 decomposed wave height predicted and reconstructed wave height using the neuro wavelet technique dixit et al 2015 removed prediction lags due to the univariant input dixit and londhe 2016 made predictions for extreme wave height by the same method with errors between actual observations and mike 21 sw predictions as the univariant time series londhe et al 2016 forecasted error variations by ann and made corrections for wave height predicted via the numerical model similarly in virtue of the wavelet neural network deshmukh et al 2016 forecasted errors between actual observed and ww3 swan predicted wave heights and updated predictions moreover a series of meteorological and oceanic parameters as multivariant input has also been considered by many oceanographers for wave prediction based on monthly mean wind speed sea level pressure and air temperature ratio as input variables günaydın 2008 compared forecasting results of significant wave height between ann and regression methods considering the prior knowledge of wind speed wind direction and significant wave height zamani et al 2008 investigated the wave prediction abilities of ann and instance based learning in the capsian sea concerning wave parameters hindcasting of the lake ontario mahjoobi et al 2008 took wind speed wind direction fetch length and wind duration as inputs and employed ann fuzzy inference systems and adaptive network based fuzzy inference system methods to forecast jain et al 2011 employed ann genetic programming and mt built the relationship of wind speed wind direction significant wave height peak period and compared the forecasting results with the numerical model mike 21 sw in the persian gulf kamranzad et al 2011 used ann to compare forecasting results under various prediction patterns with different input parameters mafi and amirinia 2017 trained wind speed significant wave height wave period pressure air temperature water temperature dew point datasets of 5 buoys in the gulf of mexico gom under hurricane gustav and ike and they predicted significant wave height for the 6th buoy by three well known soft computing methods ann svm and random forest at gom sea areas of korea and the uk kumar et al 2017 used minimal resource allocation network and the growing and pruning radial basis function network to predict wave height based on a series of meteorological parameters based on sea wave height swell wave height total wave height and their corresponding wave periods in kuwaiti territorial water al mashan et al 2019 used the gumbel and weibull distributions to predict extreme waves with the help of the deep recurrent neural network wei and cheng 2020 employed wind velocity and wave height to forecast wave height in the future until the end of 2020 the maximum significant wave height in the gom was 16 91 m which observed at 11 o clock on august 29 2005 by buoy 42 040 belonging to the national data buoy center ndbc at that time hurricane katrina was passing through the ocean near the buoy buoy 42 001 captured the maximum wind speed of 47 2 m s at 20 o clock on oct 2nd 2002 wave direction and wind direction in the gulf are both in the range of 0 359 by using a kind of neural network model that is the conditional restricted boltzmann machine deep belief network crbm dbn zhang and dai 2019 predicted wave height in the gom with the wave height as the univariant input and demonstrated its excellent ability for the short term prediction so far however the prediction effects of different input variables have not been discussed based on the crbm dbn model since the crbm dbn model is site specific the prediction effects comparison of different locations and inputs may help to select suitable prediction patterns so as to obtain the best applications of short term and long term predictions given the wave generation evolution and dissipation resulting from many meteorological and oceanic factors therefore wind and wave parameters are considered comprehensively in the paper we select two kinds of prediction patterns using the univariate input and two others with the multivariate input with the crbm dbn model selected datasets of all 12 buoys managed by ndbc in the gom are used to train and test the short term and long term prediction effects for the significant wave height with different patterns and oceans are investigated and compared in detail unless otherwise specified the following wave height refers to significant wave height 2 method 2 1 prediction model a standard restricted boltzmann machine rbm structure consists of a visible layer and a hidden layer fig 1 a the traditional deep belief network dbn is composed of multiple rbm stacks and a classification layer or regression layer fig 1 b in fig 1 a v 1 v 2 v i and h 1 h 2 h 3 h j represent the neurons of the visible and hidden layers a 1 a 2 a i and b 1 b 2 b 3 b j represent the biases of the visible and hidden layers and w represents the weight matrix between the visible layer and the hidden layer in fig 1 b from the input visible layer v to the next high level h n every two adjacent layers constitute an rbm the output of the hidden layer of the lower rbm is used as the input of the visible layer of the higher rbm and the rbms are stacked layer by layer for the unsupervised pre training to complete the feature extraction of the input data finally the features extracted by the rbms are mapped to the label data through the activation function and algorithms such as back propagation are used for supervised fine tuning hinton et al 2006 since the dbn does not contain any temporal information it is generally suitable for modeling static data längkvist et al 2014 to predict the significant wave height which is a kind of typical time series data time independent information is required to add as shown in fig 2 a directed autoregressive ar connections are established from the visible units at past t n time to the visible and latent ones at current time t respectively these additional connections turn rbm into conditional rbm crbm taylor et al 2006 then the crbm dbn model could be obtained by replacing the crbm with the rbm and stacking as illustrated in fig 2 b the training process of crbm dbn is similar to that of dbn except that in the pre training process it needs to append the dynamic update of biases in these units because ar connections exist in the units between t n time and t time for more detailed information about dbn and crbm dbn please refer to hinton et al 2006 and taylor et al 2006 2 2 prediction pattern wind speed is regarded as one of the most important elements influencing the wave some literature considered directly the measured wind speed as the driven physical quantity deo et al 2001 malekmohamadi et al 2008 mahjoobi and etemad shahidi 2008 mahjoobi and mosabbeb 2009 jain et al 2011 according to the method in the coastal engineering manual us army 2008 others converted the wind speed at an arbitrary height into the friction velocity and construct models equations 1 and 2 are used for the transformation from the measured wind speed to the friction velocity 1 u 10 u z 10 z 1 7 2 u u 10 c d where u z is the measured wind speed at the anemometer level z u 10 is the wind speed at the universally accepted elevation of 10 m u is the friction velocity and c d is the wind drag coefficient nitsure et al 2012 mafi and amirinia 2017 all predicted the wave height in the gom via using the friction velocity as the input we also adopt the friction velocity owing to the same study area besides mafi and amirinia 2017 compared the prediction effects with three kinds of wind drag coefficients i e eqs 9 11 in that literature and suggested different assumptions for the friction velocity can be interchangeable therefore a bulk formula regarding the drag coefficient proposed by wu in 1982 is used in the paper it can be expressed by eq 3 3 c d 1 2875 10 3 i f u 10 7 5 m s 0 8 0 065 u 10 10 3 i f u 10 7 5 m s historical wave height changes the sea level roughness so it is also an important factor for wave generation wind direction and dominant wave direction are considered to play an important role in wave growth the wind has the greatest influence if there is no significant difference between the wind direction and the dominant wave direction otherwise the wind effect is relatively weaker kamranzad et al 2011 hence cos φ θ is used to quantize in the paper here φ θ represent the wind direction and dominant wave direction respectively previous studies demonstrated that it could not improve forecasting results effectively when the fetch length and wind duration were used as the input parameters for ann deo et al 2001 mahjoobi et al 2008 similarly the participation of the peak and wave periods could not heighten the prediction accuracy significantly kamranzad et al 2011 moreover parameters collected at the same time may not be simultaneously valid according to the data characteristics of ndbc buoys in fact the training and forecasting of the model would be affected if there is too little successive valid data due to excessive input variables as the model crbm dbn developed from ann therefore we take no account of the influence on the fetch length wind duration and wave period to the wave consequently in the paper four parameters that the significant wave height dominant wave direction friction velocity and wind direction are taken as the inputs of four prediction patterns which are two kinds of univariate input and two kinds of multivariate input i e 4 pattern a hereinafter a h s t i f h s t n h s t 5 pattern b hereinafter b h s t i f u t n u t 6 pattern c hereinafter c h s t i f h s t n h s t u t n u t 7 pattern d hereinafter d h s t i f h s t n h s t u t n cos φ t n θ t n u t cos φ t θ t where f represents a function x t x t n represent the observed physical quantity x at the current time t and historical time t n while x t i it is the predicted one x at a future time t i x could be h s u φ or θ 2 3 model parameters using trial and error we determine the key model parameters for the wave height prediction of all 12 buoys in the gom these parameters are displayed in table 1 3 study area and data description as shown in fig 3 ndbc maintains a wave buoy network including 12 buoys in the gom now 42 001 42 002 42 003 42 039 42 055 and 42 056 distribute in the deep ocean while 42 012 42 019 42 020 42 035 42 036 and 42 040 in the shallow water the diameters of 42 001 42 040 are 2 3 m and 2 4 m while others are 3 m theoretically sensors mounted on each buoy provide meteorological and oceanic parameters every 1 h for each buoy we make statistics on data characteristics from the year with its available data to 2020 which include the largest wave height the proportion of the bigger wave height hs 5 m and the number of valid input output pairs for each pattern in every year according to the findings of zhang and dai 2019 when using the crbm dbn model and the wave height univariate pattern to make predictions it is not that the longer the training duration the better the prediction performance in other words the relationship between the prediction effect and the training duration is not clear hence in the paper we employ one year wave and wind data for training to predict for the next year from all year data of each buoy the testing year is selected with a higher priority that is we select the data of one year for testing first and then the year immediately preceding the testing one is naturally set to the training year the numbers of the inputs among patterns are different and some parameters at the same time may be null for example the null value is 99 for wave height while it is 999 for wind direction therefore the number of valid input output pairs varies with patterns in order to compare the prediction effects among four patterns more objectively we try our best to choose the year with an identical number of valid input output pairs as the testing year besides based on the sample period 1 h if the null data for some observed parameter is absent in the whole year then the total data number is approximately 365 24 8760 so the number of valid input output pairs should be close to the value 8760 as far as possible since the majority of larger waves in the gom are caused by storms us army 2008 the proportion of the bigger wave height is also considered when we select the testing year according to the aforementioned principles we consider comprehensively and choose the appropriate training and testing years for each buoy table 2 shows the information on positions water depths anemometer levels training years testing years and data characteristics of wave height for all buoys it can be found from table 2 that the maximum value in ratios of the maximum difference to the number of valid input output pairs in a is only 10 349 which appears in the testing year 2017 of 42 012 in other words the maximum differences in numbers of valid input output pairs among patterns are tiny for all buoys so the influence on the forecasting results comparison which is resulting from very small differences existing in the numbers of valid input output pairs among patterns may be neglected what needs to be pointed out is that root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency ce are used to evaluate the whole forecasting results of different prediction patterns equations for rmse ce are 8 r m s e i 1 n x y 2 n and 9 c e 1 i 1 n x y 2 i 1 n x x 2 where x y are the observed and predicted wave heights x is the average value of x term n is the number of wave height data 4 results and discussions based on the crbm dbn model we utilize all buoys datasets in the years illustrated in table 2 combine the model parameters in table 1 and employ a b c d patterns to train and test lead times are 3 6 12 24 and 48 h moreover in consideration of the existence of the prediction lag effect we also use the time correction factor to shift the original results and remove the lag referring to the method in the paper of zhang and dai 2019 time series of the observed and predicted wave heights are compared respectively for each buoy and every lead time rmse and ce are calculated according to eqs 8 and 9 the forecasting error statistics are shown in fig 4 and fig 5 corresponding to deep and shallow waters respectively 4 1 short term forecasting results when the lead time is less than or equal to 12 h as a whole we could find easily in figs 4 and 5 that the prediction effects of 4 patterns from superior to inferior are a d c b for each buoy it is reflected as the forecasting error that a rmse d rmse c rmse b rmse and a ce d ce c ce b ce the specific error indicators of the short term forecast errors are exhibited in table 3 4 2 long term forecasting results short term prediction law varies obviously with the latitude when the lead time stretches to 24 h and 48 h with regard to 42 003 located in the middle latitude of the gom pattern b which has surpassed a is no longer the worst pattern for 42 001 and 42 003 the forecasting errors between c and d are approximate in 24 h lead time while d is much smaller than c in 48 h lead time moreover the prediction accuracy of d is higher than a the same is true for 42 002 which has the optimal prediction effect in d the long term forecast errors of 42 001 42 002 and 42 003 are shown in table 4 the prediction accuracy of d for 42 003 is most ahead of a in table 4 with it as an example fig 6 exhibits the time series of the observed a and d predicted wave heights in 24 h and 48 h it could be found from fig 6 a that in 24 h prediction the observed a and d predicted wave heights are still relatively consistent in trend compared with d the a forecasting results are farther away from the actual observations for larger e g hs 3 m and smaller e g hs 1 m wave heights hs 4 03 m for predicted a while hs 5 08 m for predicted d at the peak wave height of 11 04 m the phenomenon is more obvious in the 48 h lead time predicted d is still keeping pace with the observation while predicted a focuses on the range of 1m 2 5 m in the whole year hs 1 79 m for predicted a and hs 4 69 m for predicted d at the maximal wave height the overall forecast effect of pattern d is far ahead of a to the north of 26 n 42 019 42 020 and 42 035 lie in the west and 42 012 42 036 42 039 42 040 in the east their long term forecast errors are shown in table 5 from table 5 to the northwest regions of 26 n the prediction effects comparisons of all patterns for 42 019 42 020 satisfy the relationship of d a c b from good to bad the prediction error ranges of the optimal pattern d are 0 24 m d rmse 0 44 m and 0 54 d ce 0 90 the three patterns a c and d of 42 035 have similar forecasting results over b to the northeast regions of 26 n the prediction results of 42 012 and 42 040 are similar to 42 035 for 42 036 the prediction effects of a c and d are almost on a par in 24 h lead time while d exceeds a when the lead time increases to 48 h the forecasting accuracies of four patterns for 42 039 in 24 h which rank from superior to inferior is d c a b d rmse 0 34 m d ce 0 84 and it turns to d c b a with d rmse 0 74 m d ce 0 27 in 48 h forecasting error results of all patterns for 42 055 and 42 056 located at the south of 26 n are exhibited in table 6 in table 6 the forecasting results of c for 42 055 are best while the ones of a and d are approximate for 42 056 a and d both have an almost identical optimal effect which is similar to c in summary table 7 shows the optimal prediction pattern of each buoy at different lead times when a buoy has the two best prediction patterns under one lead time it means that the prediction results of the two patterns are almost the same the absolute value of rmse between the two patterns is less than 0 02 m the best pattern is outside the bracket and the second best one is inside the bracket in addition as reflected in fig 7 we use colors with different brightnesses to signify the d long term prediction performance in the four patterns at each buoy the brighter the color the greater the superiority of d it could be found that the buoys colors in the vicinity of 26 n ocean are most gorgeous the brightnesses of buoys colors are darkening gradually with latitude increasing northward and with latitude decreasing southward when lead time 12 h historical wave height plays a major role in the formation of waves kamranzad et al 2011 so compared with other patterns a has the outstanding performance in the short term prediction of each buoy position and almost monopolizes the best under all conditions in table 7 as the lead time becomes larger the relationship between the historical wave height and the predicted wave height is gradually decreasing and the influence of wind on the waves is gradually increasing in other words the temporal lag exists in the relationship between wind and wave growth kamranzad et al 2011 this is reflected in table 7 of that paper of kamranzad et al 2011 when wind speed is selected as the only input the prediction error of the lead time 6 h is less than 3 h this situation is similar to the crbm dbn model developed by ann which is particularly evident in fig 5 b and c in the paper only considering the wind speed of pattern b the prediction accuracies of shallow water buoys 42 019 and 42 020 located at the westernmost end of the gom improve significantly as the lead time increases large scale high pressure systems sometimes influence the gom with winds blowing from east to west across much of the gulf these winds are primarily responsible for the higher wave conditions in the western gulf us army 2008 compared with coastal buoys 42 012 42 035 42 040 located in the northern gom and 42 055 42 056 deployed in the deep water of southern gom wave heights observed by 42 001 42 002 42 003 42 019 42 020 42 036 and 42 039 are regarded as resulting from the winds more reasonably furthermore the selected testing years for 42 001 42 002 42 003 42 036 and 42 039 are all 2004 when hurricane ivan happened its path was close to 42 001 and 42 003 which directly caused that the maximum wave heights in the whole year were 8 77 m and 11 04 m respectively in the meanwhile ivan also affected several other buoys for the long term forecast pattern d which comprehensively considers wave height wave direction wind speed and wind direction accounts for 22 24 100 91 67 of the optimal and sub optimal forecast results in table 7 and performs well hence we may consider employing d for the long term prediction of wave height in or near the positions of buoys 42 001 42 002 42 003 42 019 42 020 42 036 and 42 039 while for the oceans of buoys 42 012 42 035 42 040 42 055 and 42 056 d is not the optimal pattern but the predicted results are approximate to the best ones so it could

20422,based on the conditional restricted boltzmann machine deep belief network crbm dbn we select four patterns and compare their prediction effects for the significant wave height in the gulf of mexico gom historical datasets of all 12 buoys managed by the national data buoy center are employed to train and construct models root mean square error rmse and coefficient of efficiency ce between the observed and predicted wave heights are investigated we find that for the short term prediction i e lead time 12 h the best results rmse 0 24 m and ce 0 92 are achieved with the univariate significant wave height as the input in most cases of the whole gulf when the lead time is equal to 24 h or 48 h the multivariate pattern of significant wave height dominant wave direction wind speed wind direction has the optimal effects 0 18 m rmse 0 40 m and 0 72 ce 0 93 in the vicinity of 26 n oceans the superiority is very obvious and gradually diminishes as the latitude increases to the north and decreases to the south regarding the wave height predictions in different oceans of gom the findings provide evidence that it may be contributed to select optimal prediction patterns and obtain the best applications keywords crbm dbn gulf of mexico prediction for the significant wave height univariate and multivariate prediction patterns 1 introduction accurate prediction of wave characteristics is of great significance for many coastal ocean engineering and marine activities contributing factors for the wave are numerous and complicated so far the wave characteristics have not been described exactly and quantitatively by universal and determinate mathematical models it only considers qualitatively that the wave variation is codetermined via many meteorological and oceanic factors such as wave wind etc wave prediction technologies are mainly composed of numerical models such as the wave model wam wamdi group 1988 simulating waves nearshore swan booij et al 1999 ris et al 1999 wavewatch iii ww3 tolman 1989 machine learning methods e g support vector machine svm genetic algorithm ga fuzzy logic fl artificial neural network ann and hybrids of the above two methods numerical methods attempt to forecast waves by mathematical models established approximately for some regional oceans the methods could achieve accurate results but their computational cost is very high machine learning methods only need to know which factors are related to the target physical quantity the prediction processes are that with prediction patterns of univariant or multivariant inputs selected historical information is trained input output prediction models are set up and future waves are forecasted as a kind of important machine learning approach many researchers have focused on taking wind speed significant wave height or its prediction error respectively as the univariant input to train models with the ann or its hybrid methods by using wind speed deo et al 2001 constructed a feed forward neural network with 3 layers and forecasted significant wave height and mean wave period in virtue of ann makarynskyy 2004 londhe and panchang 2006 predicted wave heights in different oceans under the pattern of wind speed wave height malekmohamadi et al 2008 combined ann with numerical models and predicted wave parameters in the lake superior and the pacific ocean under wind speed model tree mt was compared with ann to predict wave height in lake superior etemad shahidi and mahjoobi 2009 with the help of wavelet and ann deka and prahlada 2012 decomposed wave height predicted and reconstructed wave height using the neuro wavelet technique dixit et al 2015 removed prediction lags due to the univariant input dixit and londhe 2016 made predictions for extreme wave height by the same method with errors between actual observations and mike 21 sw predictions as the univariant time series londhe et al 2016 forecasted error variations by ann and made corrections for wave height predicted via the numerical model similarly in virtue of the wavelet neural network deshmukh et al 2016 forecasted errors between actual observed and ww3 swan predicted wave heights and updated predictions moreover a series of meteorological and oceanic parameters as multivariant input has also been considered by many oceanographers for wave prediction based on monthly mean wind speed sea level pressure and air temperature ratio as input variables günaydın 2008 compared forecasting results of significant wave height between ann and regression methods considering the prior knowledge of wind speed wind direction and significant wave height zamani et al 2008 investigated the wave prediction abilities of ann and instance based learning in the capsian sea concerning wave parameters hindcasting of the lake ontario mahjoobi et al 2008 took wind speed wind direction fetch length and wind duration as inputs and employed ann fuzzy inference systems and adaptive network based fuzzy inference system methods to forecast jain et al 2011 employed ann genetic programming and mt built the relationship of wind speed wind direction significant wave height peak period and compared the forecasting results with the numerical model mike 21 sw in the persian gulf kamranzad et al 2011 used ann to compare forecasting results under various prediction patterns with different input parameters mafi and amirinia 2017 trained wind speed significant wave height wave period pressure air temperature water temperature dew point datasets of 5 buoys in the gulf of mexico gom under hurricane gustav and ike and they predicted significant wave height for the 6th buoy by three well known soft computing methods ann svm and random forest at gom sea areas of korea and the uk kumar et al 2017 used minimal resource allocation network and the growing and pruning radial basis function network to predict wave height based on a series of meteorological parameters based on sea wave height swell wave height total wave height and their corresponding wave periods in kuwaiti territorial water al mashan et al 2019 used the gumbel and weibull distributions to predict extreme waves with the help of the deep recurrent neural network wei and cheng 2020 employed wind velocity and wave height to forecast wave height in the future until the end of 2020 the maximum significant wave height in the gom was 16 91 m which observed at 11 o clock on august 29 2005 by buoy 42 040 belonging to the national data buoy center ndbc at that time hurricane katrina was passing through the ocean near the buoy buoy 42 001 captured the maximum wind speed of 47 2 m s at 20 o clock on oct 2nd 2002 wave direction and wind direction in the gulf are both in the range of 0 359 by using a kind of neural network model that is the conditional restricted boltzmann machine deep belief network crbm dbn zhang and dai 2019 predicted wave height in the gom with the wave height as the univariant input and demonstrated its excellent ability for the short term prediction so far however the prediction effects of different input variables have not been discussed based on the crbm dbn model since the crbm dbn model is site specific the prediction effects comparison of different locations and inputs may help to select suitable prediction patterns so as to obtain the best applications of short term and long term predictions given the wave generation evolution and dissipation resulting from many meteorological and oceanic factors therefore wind and wave parameters are considered comprehensively in the paper we select two kinds of prediction patterns using the univariate input and two others with the multivariate input with the crbm dbn model selected datasets of all 12 buoys managed by ndbc in the gom are used to train and test the short term and long term prediction effects for the significant wave height with different patterns and oceans are investigated and compared in detail unless otherwise specified the following wave height refers to significant wave height 2 method 2 1 prediction model a standard restricted boltzmann machine rbm structure consists of a visible layer and a hidden layer fig 1 a the traditional deep belief network dbn is composed of multiple rbm stacks and a classification layer or regression layer fig 1 b in fig 1 a v 1 v 2 v i and h 1 h 2 h 3 h j represent the neurons of the visible and hidden layers a 1 a 2 a i and b 1 b 2 b 3 b j represent the biases of the visible and hidden layers and w represents the weight matrix between the visible layer and the hidden layer in fig 1 b from the input visible layer v to the next high level h n every two adjacent layers constitute an rbm the output of the hidden layer of the lower rbm is used as the input of the visible layer of the higher rbm and the rbms are stacked layer by layer for the unsupervised pre training to complete the feature extraction of the input data finally the features extracted by the rbms are mapped to the label data through the activation function and algorithms such as back propagation are used for supervised fine tuning hinton et al 2006 since the dbn does not contain any temporal information it is generally suitable for modeling static data längkvist et al 2014 to predict the significant wave height which is a kind of typical time series data time independent information is required to add as shown in fig 2 a directed autoregressive ar connections are established from the visible units at past t n time to the visible and latent ones at current time t respectively these additional connections turn rbm into conditional rbm crbm taylor et al 2006 then the crbm dbn model could be obtained by replacing the crbm with the rbm and stacking as illustrated in fig 2 b the training process of crbm dbn is similar to that of dbn except that in the pre training process it needs to append the dynamic update of biases in these units because ar connections exist in the units between t n time and t time for more detailed information about dbn and crbm dbn please refer to hinton et al 2006 and taylor et al 2006 2 2 prediction pattern wind speed is regarded as one of the most important elements influencing the wave some literature considered directly the measured wind speed as the driven physical quantity deo et al 2001 malekmohamadi et al 2008 mahjoobi and etemad shahidi 2008 mahjoobi and mosabbeb 2009 jain et al 2011 according to the method in the coastal engineering manual us army 2008 others converted the wind speed at an arbitrary height into the friction velocity and construct models equations 1 and 2 are used for the transformation from the measured wind speed to the friction velocity 1 u 10 u z 10 z 1 7 2 u u 10 c d where u z is the measured wind speed at the anemometer level z u 10 is the wind speed at the universally accepted elevation of 10 m u is the friction velocity and c d is the wind drag coefficient nitsure et al 2012 mafi and amirinia 2017 all predicted the wave height in the gom via using the friction velocity as the input we also adopt the friction velocity owing to the same study area besides mafi and amirinia 2017 compared the prediction effects with three kinds of wind drag coefficients i e eqs 9 11 in that literature and suggested different assumptions for the friction velocity can be interchangeable therefore a bulk formula regarding the drag coefficient proposed by wu in 1982 is used in the paper it can be expressed by eq 3 3 c d 1 2875 10 3 i f u 10 7 5 m s 0 8 0 065 u 10 10 3 i f u 10 7 5 m s historical wave height changes the sea level roughness so it is also an important factor for wave generation wind direction and dominant wave direction are considered to play an important role in wave growth the wind has the greatest influence if there is no significant difference between the wind direction and the dominant wave direction otherwise the wind effect is relatively weaker kamranzad et al 2011 hence cos φ θ is used to quantize in the paper here φ θ represent the wind direction and dominant wave direction respectively previous studies demonstrated that it could not improve forecasting results effectively when the fetch length and wind duration were used as the input parameters for ann deo et al 2001 mahjoobi et al 2008 similarly the participation of the peak and wave periods could not heighten the prediction accuracy significantly kamranzad et al 2011 moreover parameters collected at the same time may not be simultaneously valid according to the data characteristics of ndbc buoys in fact the training and forecasting of the model would be affected if there is too little successive valid data due to excessive input variables as the model crbm dbn developed from ann therefore we take no account of the influence on the fetch length wind duration and wave period to the wave consequently in the paper four parameters that the significant wave height dominant wave direction friction velocity and wind direction are taken as the inputs of four prediction patterns which are two kinds of univariate input and two kinds of multivariate input i e 4 pattern a hereinafter a h s t i f h s t n h s t 5 pattern b hereinafter b h s t i f u t n u t 6 pattern c hereinafter c h s t i f h s t n h s t u t n u t 7 pattern d hereinafter d h s t i f h s t n h s t u t n cos φ t n θ t n u t cos φ t θ t where f represents a function x t x t n represent the observed physical quantity x at the current time t and historical time t n while x t i it is the predicted one x at a future time t i x could be h s u φ or θ 2 3 model parameters using trial and error we determine the key model parameters for the wave height prediction of all 12 buoys in the gom these parameters are displayed in table 1 3 study area and data description as shown in fig 3 ndbc maintains a wave buoy network including 12 buoys in the gom now 42 001 42 002 42 003 42 039 42 055 and 42 056 distribute in the deep ocean while 42 012 42 019 42 020 42 035 42 036 and 42 040 in the shallow water the diameters of 42 001 42 040 are 2 3 m and 2 4 m while others are 3 m theoretically sensors mounted on each buoy provide meteorological and oceanic parameters every 1 h for each buoy we make statistics on data characteristics from the year with its available data to 2020 which include the largest wave height the proportion of the bigger wave height hs 5 m and the number of valid input output pairs for each pattern in every year according to the findings of zhang and dai 2019 when using the crbm dbn model and the wave height univariate pattern to make predictions it is not that the longer the training duration the better the prediction performance in other words the relationship between the prediction effect and the training duration is not clear hence in the paper we employ one year wave and wind data for training to predict for the next year from all year data of each buoy the testing year is selected with a higher priority that is we select the data of one year for testing first and then the year immediately preceding the testing one is naturally set to the training year the numbers of the inputs among patterns are different and some parameters at the same time may be null for example the null value is 99 for wave height while it is 999 for wind direction therefore the number of valid input output pairs varies with patterns in order to compare the prediction effects among four patterns more objectively we try our best to choose the year with an identical number of valid input output pairs as the testing year besides based on the sample period 1 h if the null data for some observed parameter is absent in the whole year then the total data number is approximately 365 24 8760 so the number of valid input output pairs should be close to the value 8760 as far as possible since the majority of larger waves in the gom are caused by storms us army 2008 the proportion of the bigger wave height is also considered when we select the testing year according to the aforementioned principles we consider comprehensively and choose the appropriate training and testing years for each buoy table 2 shows the information on positions water depths anemometer levels training years testing years and data characteristics of wave height for all buoys it can be found from table 2 that the maximum value in ratios of the maximum difference to the number of valid input output pairs in a is only 10 349 which appears in the testing year 2017 of 42 012 in other words the maximum differences in numbers of valid input output pairs among patterns are tiny for all buoys so the influence on the forecasting results comparison which is resulting from very small differences existing in the numbers of valid input output pairs among patterns may be neglected what needs to be pointed out is that root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency ce are used to evaluate the whole forecasting results of different prediction patterns equations for rmse ce are 8 r m s e i 1 n x y 2 n and 9 c e 1 i 1 n x y 2 i 1 n x x 2 where x y are the observed and predicted wave heights x is the average value of x term n is the number of wave height data 4 results and discussions based on the crbm dbn model we utilize all buoys datasets in the years illustrated in table 2 combine the model parameters in table 1 and employ a b c d patterns to train and test lead times are 3 6 12 24 and 48 h moreover in consideration of the existence of the prediction lag effect we also use the time correction factor to shift the original results and remove the lag referring to the method in the paper of zhang and dai 2019 time series of the observed and predicted wave heights are compared respectively for each buoy and every lead time rmse and ce are calculated according to eqs 8 and 9 the forecasting error statistics are shown in fig 4 and fig 5 corresponding to deep and shallow waters respectively 4 1 short term forecasting results when the lead time is less than or equal to 12 h as a whole we could find easily in figs 4 and 5 that the prediction effects of 4 patterns from superior to inferior are a d c b for each buoy it is reflected as the forecasting error that a rmse d rmse c rmse b rmse and a ce d ce c ce b ce the specific error indicators of the short term forecast errors are exhibited in table 3 4 2 long term forecasting results short term prediction law varies obviously with the latitude when the lead time stretches to 24 h and 48 h with regard to 42 003 located in the middle latitude of the gom pattern b which has surpassed a is no longer the worst pattern for 42 001 and 42 003 the forecasting errors between c and d are approximate in 24 h lead time while d is much smaller than c in 48 h lead time moreover the prediction accuracy of d is higher than a the same is true for 42 002 which has the optimal prediction effect in d the long term forecast errors of 42 001 42 002 and 42 003 are shown in table 4 the prediction accuracy of d for 42 003 is most ahead of a in table 4 with it as an example fig 6 exhibits the time series of the observed a and d predicted wave heights in 24 h and 48 h it could be found from fig 6 a that in 24 h prediction the observed a and d predicted wave heights are still relatively consistent in trend compared with d the a forecasting results are farther away from the actual observations for larger e g hs 3 m and smaller e g hs 1 m wave heights hs 4 03 m for predicted a while hs 5 08 m for predicted d at the peak wave height of 11 04 m the phenomenon is more obvious in the 48 h lead time predicted d is still keeping pace with the observation while predicted a focuses on the range of 1m 2 5 m in the whole year hs 1 79 m for predicted a and hs 4 69 m for predicted d at the maximal wave height the overall forecast effect of pattern d is far ahead of a to the north of 26 n 42 019 42 020 and 42 035 lie in the west and 42 012 42 036 42 039 42 040 in the east their long term forecast errors are shown in table 5 from table 5 to the northwest regions of 26 n the prediction effects comparisons of all patterns for 42 019 42 020 satisfy the relationship of d a c b from good to bad the prediction error ranges of the optimal pattern d are 0 24 m d rmse 0 44 m and 0 54 d ce 0 90 the three patterns a c and d of 42 035 have similar forecasting results over b to the northeast regions of 26 n the prediction results of 42 012 and 42 040 are similar to 42 035 for 42 036 the prediction effects of a c and d are almost on a par in 24 h lead time while d exceeds a when the lead time increases to 48 h the forecasting accuracies of four patterns for 42 039 in 24 h which rank from superior to inferior is d c a b d rmse 0 34 m d ce 0 84 and it turns to d c b a with d rmse 0 74 m d ce 0 27 in 48 h forecasting error results of all patterns for 42 055 and 42 056 located at the south of 26 n are exhibited in table 6 in table 6 the forecasting results of c for 42 055 are best while the ones of a and d are approximate for 42 056 a and d both have an almost identical optimal effect which is similar to c in summary table 7 shows the optimal prediction pattern of each buoy at different lead times when a buoy has the two best prediction patterns under one lead time it means that the prediction results of the two patterns are almost the same the absolute value of rmse between the two patterns is less than 0 02 m the best pattern is outside the bracket and the second best one is inside the bracket in addition as reflected in fig 7 we use colors with different brightnesses to signify the d long term prediction performance in the four patterns at each buoy the brighter the color the greater the superiority of d it could be found that the buoys colors in the vicinity of 26 n ocean are most gorgeous the brightnesses of buoys colors are darkening gradually with latitude increasing northward and with latitude decreasing southward when lead time 12 h historical wave height plays a major role in the formation of waves kamranzad et al 2011 so compared with other patterns a has the outstanding performance in the short term prediction of each buoy position and almost monopolizes the best under all conditions in table 7 as the lead time becomes larger the relationship between the historical wave height and the predicted wave height is gradually decreasing and the influence of wind on the waves is gradually increasing in other words the temporal lag exists in the relationship between wind and wave growth kamranzad et al 2011 this is reflected in table 7 of that paper of kamranzad et al 2011 when wind speed is selected as the only input the prediction error of the lead time 6 h is less than 3 h this situation is similar to the crbm dbn model developed by ann which is particularly evident in fig 5 b and c in the paper only considering the wind speed of pattern b the prediction accuracies of shallow water buoys 42 019 and 42 020 located at the westernmost end of the gom improve significantly as the lead time increases large scale high pressure systems sometimes influence the gom with winds blowing from east to west across much of the gulf these winds are primarily responsible for the higher wave conditions in the western gulf us army 2008 compared with coastal buoys 42 012 42 035 42 040 located in the northern gom and 42 055 42 056 deployed in the deep water of southern gom wave heights observed by 42 001 42 002 42 003 42 019 42 020 42 036 and 42 039 are regarded as resulting from the winds more reasonably furthermore the selected testing years for 42 001 42 002 42 003 42 036 and 42 039 are all 2004 when hurricane ivan happened its path was close to 42 001 and 42 003 which directly caused that the maximum wave heights in the whole year were 8 77 m and 11 04 m respectively in the meanwhile ivan also affected several other buoys for the long term forecast pattern d which comprehensively considers wave height wave direction wind speed and wind direction accounts for 22 24 100 91 67 of the optimal and sub optimal forecast results in table 7 and performs well hence we may consider employing d for the long term prediction of wave height in or near the positions of buoys 42 001 42 002 42 003 42 019 42 020 42 036 and 42 039 while for the oceans of buoys 42 012 42 035 42 040 42 055 and 42 056 d is not the optimal pattern but the predicted results are approximate to the best ones so it could also be considered to select 5 conclusions in the paper we select all 12 buoys recording meteorological and oceanic information in the gom and compare the prediction effects of four different patterns systematically by using the crbm dbn model the lead times are 3 6 12 h and 24 48 h which correspond to the short term and long term predictions in the short term prediction the forecasting results of a are superior to other patterns in most cases of all buoys for the long term prediction the best prediction pattern for a buoy presents the characteristic related to its latitude pattern d is the best one for the oceans at or around 26 n besides d is more significantly effective than the other 3 patterns with latitude 26 n taken as the boundary the long term prediction advantage of d is weakening gradually northward and southward eventually the prediction effect of d is approximate to a and c based on crbm dbn the findings may provide the reference to pattern selections for the short term and long term predictions of wave height from area to area besides the gom serves as a case study in the paper and a similar analysis of wave height forecasting in the other oceans could also be

20423,the numerical implementation approach named nm lsa of the neumann michell nm theory by using the linear semi analytical method for panel integral is established to solve ship waves the nm theory is a boundary integral equation method which is discretized by using 4 node isoparametric elements with linear flow potential distribution in this paper to overcome the difficulty of panel integral of wave component in the green function the nm lsa employs the analytical panel integral related to the elementary wave the filter function based on parabolic extrapolation within a layer bordering the free surface is used to remove unwanted short waves the analytical panel integral of elementary wave over a triangular panel is derived and applied to compute the spatial integral of wave potential in addition another numerical implementation approach named nm lg of the nm theory by using linear gauss method for panel integral is established two sets of filter parameters and five hulls are selected to validate the above mentioned numerical methods the simulation results obtained by different numerical methods show good agreement with experimental measurements moreover the time consumption of wave drag computation per froude number via the nm lsa is reduced by about 40 compared to that via the nm lg keywords ship waves numerical implementation neumann michell theory analytical panel integral linear boundary element method 1 introduction free surface flow due to a ship steadily advancing at constant speed in calm water of effectively infinite depth and lateral extent called ship waves is a classical ship hydrodynamic problem that has been widely studied for many decades the yield results of ship waves are considerable practical importance for ship design at early stage especially for hull form optimization it is very benefit for engineer to learn the trend of ship drag with hull form deformation for the sake of engineering application a numerical method of high efficiency and accuracy at low cost to study ship waves is needed generally potential flow methods that rely on the boundary integral equation method incorporating with a green function method are considered usually there are two types of green functions used to study ship waves one is rankine source green function that only satisfies laplace equation the other is havelock free surface source green function which satisfies laplace equation kelvin michell linearized free surface condition and radiation condition rankine source method was first applied by dawson 1977 dawson 1977 to solve ship waves the nonlinear effects chen et al 2016 chen et al 2016 of free surface and hull boundary can be considered in rankine source method while the rankine sources are required to be distributed on all flow boundaries of fluid domain as for havelock source green function methods the sources or dipoles only need to be distributed on ship hull surface the neumann kelvin nk theory proposed by brard 1972 brard 1972 and guevel et al 1974 guevel et al 1974 is a typical free surface green function method which consists of a troublesome waterline integral the integrand of this waterline integral is gφ x φg x which has been eliminated in the neumann michell nm theory noblesse et al 2013 noblesse et al 2013a huang et al 2013 huang et al 2013 yang et al 2013 yang et al 2013 by the following two steps ⅰ deriving the nm consistent linear flow model through linearization and the integrand term gφ x does not appear within this consistent linear flow model ⅱ applying a mathematical transformation and a practical simplification to eliminate the integrand term φg x the wave drag coefficients sinkage trim and wave profiles huang et al 2013 huang et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 computed by the nm theory show overall good agreement with the experiment measurements which have verified the accuracy of nm theory however most of the numerical implementation methods of the nm theory were based on low order panel approach where the half of mean wetted hull surface was approximated by about 8000 10000 triangular flat panels as expounded by huang et al 2013 huang et al 2013 the mathematical expressions given by noblesse et al 2013 noblesse et al 2013a are not sufficient to fully determine the nm theory and the numerical implementation of the nm theory is an essential element of this theory then the numerical implementation method of the nm theory by using linear gauss method for panel integral called nm lg is first established in this paper in the nm lg the number of gauss points that need to be distributed on the 4 node panels used to discretize the mean wetted hull surface is numerically studied for the numerical problem that the wave component w in the green function g is an oscillatory function with respect to spatial variables x and y the analytical panel integral related to the elementary wave e is derived and numerically verified then another numerical implementation method of the nm theory incorporating with this analytical panel integral called nm lsa is established for ship waves in the nm lsa the analytical panel integral is applied to compute the spatial integral of wave potential both numerical implementation methods are derived based on the linear boundary element method in the two numerical implementation methods the half of mean wetted hull surface is discretized by a series of 4 node isoparametric panels elements when the total number of nodes of discrete grids is the same the number of unknown variables of the discrete boundary integral equations by using the linear boundary element method based on 4 node panels is approximately equal to half of that by using the low order boundary element method based on flat triangular panels where the unknown variable is the velocity potential at flow field point p five hulls wigley hull series 60 model kcs hull dtmb 5415 model and fishery patrol boat and two sets of filter parameters filter 1 and filter 2 are selected to validate the two numerical methods given in this paper the simulation results of five hulls show good agreement with the experiment measurements which verifies the accuracy of the present two numerical methods moreover the time consumption of wave drag calculation for five hulls has verified the efficiency of two numerical methods and the advantage of the nm lsa in time consumption 2 the neumann michell theory for ship waves as shown in fig 1 a right handed moving coordinate system o xyz attached to the ship hull of length l s

the nm correction potential ψ w which is defined by noblesse et al 2013 noblesse et al 2013a is expressed as follows 5 ψ w h d z w y x d y w z x φ t t y w z x t z w y x φ d d a here the derivatives φ

local flow component in the hogner potential substituting the local flow component l for the green function g in eq 4 the local flow component φ h l in the hogner potential can be obtained as follows 8 φ h l h l n x d a f l π φ d x d y w i t h l l r e g where l reg denotes a regularized local flow component that is related to the singular local flow component l in the green function g in accordance with noblesse et al 2011 noblesse et al 2011 for typical displacement ships the linear kelvin michell boundary condition π φ 0 is assumed to hold for everywhere at the mean free surface σf the approximate expression of l reg is given by noblesse et al 2013 noblesse et al 2013a 2 3 wave component in the flow potential the wave component w in the green function g is defined by the fourier

noblesse et al 2011 and used to filter unrealistic short waves the functions e and e are elementary waves substituting the wave component w for the green function g in eq 4 the wave component φ h w of hogner potential φ h can be expressed as follows 10 φ h w h w n x d a f w π φ d x d y in order to get appreciably higher and sharper bow waves for flow field point p within the bow region of ship hull surface σh the wave component φ h w is evaluated at the ship centerplane y 0 in accordance with noblesse et al 2013 noblesse et al 2013a where the wave component φ h w of hogner potential is modified as follows 11 φ h w h w x ϕ y z q n q x d a q w i t h ϕ 1 exp 0 3 0 5 x 2 f 4 here the linear kelvin michell boundary condition π φ 0 at the mean free surface σf is used and the subscript q represents

respectively according to noblesse et al 2013 noblesse et al 2013a for the common case of a ship hull with port and starboard symmetry expressions 13 and 15 become 16 s h 2 f 2 σ h h n x e z c y c x i

linear boundary element method the numerical implementation strategy of wave integral for fourier kochin representations 19 and 20 can refer to the research of noblesse et al 2011 noblesse et al 2011 where the pseudo period of the oscillations is calculated and gaussian integration rule is applied the spatial integration strategy of the wave spectrum function s h and s ψ over the ship hull surface σh is the main objective of this paper and considered as follow 2 4 1 numerical implementation of local flow component in the hogner potential the local flow component in the hogner potential can be directly calculated using boundary element method different from the numerical implementation of huang et al 2013 huang et al 2013 where the hull surface σh is discretized by a set of flat triangular panels and low order panel method is applied to calculate potential we use a set of 4 node isoparametric elements to discretize the hull surface and apply linear boundary element method to calculate potential by introducing the shape functions n j s c the 3d 4 node element is mapped into a 2d parametric s c plane as shown in fig 2 a and the potential or geometrical variable can be written as follows 22 χ j 1 4 n j s c χ j w i t h n j s c 1 4 1 s j s 1 c j c here χ denotes the potential φ or geometrical variable x y z s and c are coordinates in s c plane j denote nodal number s j and c j are parametric coordinate values the shape functions of a 4 node isoparametric element are shown in fig 2 b after the isoparametric transformation we can obtain 23 φ h l h l r e g n x d a e 1 2 n e δ s e l r e g n x d a e 1 2 n e 1 1 1 1 l r e g p q s c n q s c x j s c d s d c where δs e denote 4 node panels n e is the total number of panels on the half ship hull surface σh and j s c denote jacobian determinant by distributing a few gauss points on the standard square element the local flow component φ h l can be calculated easily 2 4 2 numerical implementation of wave component in the flow potential same as local flow component in the hogner potential the wave spectrum function s h in eq 16 can be further expressed as follows 24 s h 2 f 2 e 1 n e δ s e h n x e z c y c x i s x d a 2 f 2 e 1 n e 1 1 1 1 h n q s c x e q s c z c q s c y c q s c x i s q s c x j s c d s d c where subscript q s c represents the variable value at the boundary point q determined by parameter coordinates s c after obtaining the wave spectrum function s h by eq 24 the wave component φ h w in the hogner potential can be calculated by eq 19 unlike the hogner potential the nm correction wave potential includes the derivatives φ t and φ d of potential φ which are not known at the onset thus the nm correction wave potential needs to be calculated at each iteration in order to simplify the iterative calculation and accelerate the iterative convergence speed the derivatives φ t and φ d are assumed to be constant within a 4 node panel then expression 17 yields 25 s ψ 2 f 2 e 1 n e φ t δ s e h e z q t s x i c x d a φ d δ s e h e z q d s x i c x d a 2 f 2 e 1 n e φ t 1 1 1 1 h e q s c z q t q s c s q s c x i c q s c x j s c d s d c φ d 1 1 1 1 h e q s c z q d q s c s q s c x i c q s c x j s c d s d c then the nm correction wave potential can be expressed as follows 26 ψ w 4 π f 2 0 k λ e 1 k 2 z f 2 c y e 1 n e s x s r e t e c x s i m t e φ t s x s r e d e c x s i m d e φ d d k with 27 s r e t

1 h e q s c z q d q s c c q s c x j s c d s d c it can be seen from eq 26 that all variables except φ t and φ d are known at the onset then the iterative coefficients can be constructed and these coefficients remain unchanged during the iterative process the above mentioned method for panel integral which is based on the linear boundary element method and gaussian quadrature is called linear gauss method in this paper and the numerical implementation approach of the nm theory by using linear gauss method for panel integral is named nm lg in this paper it can be seen from eq 9 that the wave component w contains the elementary wave e which is an oscillatory function with respect to spatial variables x and y thus in nm lg where the gaussian quadrature rule is applied to calculate the integrals s h and s ψ some numerical errors will be produced in the integrals s h and s ψ more gaussian points distributed on the standard square element can get smaller numerical error but will lead to an increase in time consumption to reduce the numerical errors and time consumption simultaneously the analytical panel integral that is the integral of elementary wave e over a triangular panel is derived later in the present paper 3 analytical panel integral related to the elementary wave e in order to derive the analytical panel integral related to the elementary wave e a 4 node panel is divided into two triangular panels and expressions 13 and 15 yield 28 s h 1 f 2 e 1 2 n e j 1 2 n t r i x t r i h ed a s re h i s im h 29 s ψ 1 f 2 e 1 2 n e j 1 2 k t φ t k d φ d t r i t r i h ed a s re ψ i s im ψ where j is used to distinguish two triangular panels and subscript tri represents the value of variable or variable combination over a triangular panel it should be noted that the flow velocities φ t and φ d are constant over a triangular panel when the flow potential φ changes linearly over the triangular panel in addition k t k d and n x are determined by the unit normal vector n of triangular panel thus the terms n x and k t φ t k d φ d are constant over a triangular panel and can be extracted out from the integral over a triangular panel it can be seen from expressions 28 and 29 that the key to calculate the integrals s h and s ψ lies in the integral s e which can be expressed as follows 30 s e t r i h ed a 3 1 coordinate transformations before deriving the analytical panel integral related to the elementary wave e a coordinate transformation proposed by huang et al 2020 huang et al 2020 where the triangular panel is mapped into a unit rectangle in ξoη plane is performed as shown in fig 3 line ab is parallel to side 23 point q is located on line ab the length of side 23 line ab and line aq are l 0 ηl 0 and ξ ab respectively thus point a b and q in ξoη plane can be expressed as follows 31 r a r 1 η r 2 r 1 r b r 1 η r 3 r 1 r q r 1 η r 2 r 1 ξ η r 3 r 2 where r l x l y l z l l 1 2 3 are the coordinates of three vertices of the triangle and thus 0 ξ 1 0 η 1 the integral of a function f x y z over a triangular panel can be further expressed as follows 32 s f t r i f x y z d a 0 1 0 1 f ξ η j ξ η d η d ξ here the jacobian determinant j ξ η can be expressed as follows 33 j ξ η r q ξ r q η 2 η s 0 where s 0 denotes the area of the triangular panel 3 2 analytical expression of the integral s e there is a heaviside step function h x x in the integral s e which will bring trouble to the derivation of analytical expression for the integral s e thus the heaviside step function needs to be classified in advance the value of heaviside step function over a triangular panel is determined by the relative position between the flow field point p and the triangular panel as shown in fig 4 the relative position can be classified into three situations ⅰ the coordinates x of three vertices of triangular panel are all greater than the coordinate x of flow field point p in accordance with fig 4 a and the heaviside step function equal to 1 over the whole triangular panel ⅱ the coordinates x of three vertices are all less than the coordinate x in accordance with fig 4 b and the heaviside step function equal to 0 over the whole triangular panel ⅲ the plane x x intersects with the triangular panel in accordance with fig 4 c and d in this case according to the location of this intersection one fig 4 c or two fig 4 d new triangular panels can be generated based on the original triangular panel and the heaviside step function equal to 1 over the new triangular panel through the above classification the heaviside step function in the integral s e can be removed and the integral s e can be further expressed as follows 34 s e t r i e d a 2 s 0 0 1 η d η 0 1 e q m d ξ w i t h q m m r q where m i 1 k 2 f 2 i 1 k 2 k f 2 1 k 2 f 2 and r q x y z multiplying the both sides of eq 31 by m we can obtain 35 q m a q m 1 η q m 2 q m 1 q m b q m 1 η q m 3 q m 1 q m q m 1 η q m 2 q m 1 ξ η q m 3 q m 2 with q m l 1 k 2 z l f 2 i 1 k 2 x l k y l f 2 l 1 2 3 expression 35 can further yield 36 d q m a d η q m 21 d q m b d η q m 31 d q m d ξ η q m 32 w i t h q m 21 q m 2 q m 1 q m 31 q m 3 q m 1 q m 32 q m 3 q m 2 when the above three partial derivatives in eq 36 are equal to 0 the following equation can be obtained 37 q m 32 1 k 2 z 3 z 2 f 2 i 1 k 2 x 3 x 2 k y 3 y 2 f 2 0 q m 31 1 k 2 z 3 z 1 f 2 i 1 k 2 x 3 x 1 k y 3 y 1 f 2 0 q m 21 1 k 2 z 2 z 1 f 2 i 1 k 2 x 2 x 1 k y 2 y 1 f 2 0 the eq 37 can further yield 38 z 3 z 2 x 3 x 2 y 3 y 2 k z 3 z 1 x 3 x 1 y 3 y 1 k z 2 z 1 x 2 x 1 y 2 y 1 k it can be seen from eq 38 that if any two of the three partial derivatives in eq 36 are equal to 0 the coordinates z of three vertices of triangular panel must be equal to each other and the corresponding two sides of the triangular panel must be parallel to each other with the same slope k thus only one of the three partial derivatives in eq 36 may be equal to 0 when one of the three partial derivatives is equal to 0 the partial derivative that equal to 0 can be adjusted to q m 21 by swapping the order of three vertices of the triangular panel according to whether q m 21 is equal to 0 the calculation of integral s e is divided into two cases ⅰ d q m a d η q m 21 0 the integral s e can be expressed as follows 39 s e 2 s 0 0 1 η d η 0 1 e q m d ξ 2 s 0 q m 32 0 1 d η q m a q m b e q m d q m 2 s 0 q m 32 0 1 e q m b e q m a d η 2 s 0 q m 32 e q m b η 0 η 1 q m 31 e q m a η 0 η 1 q m 21 2 s 0 q m 32 e q m 3 e q m 1 q m 31 e q m 2 e q m 1 q m 21 ⅱ d q m a d η q m 21 0 the integral s e can be expressed as follows 40 s e 2 s 0 q m 32 0 1 e q m b e q m a d η 2 s 0 q m 32 e q m b η 0 η 1 q m 31 e q m 1 η 0 1 2 s 0 q m 32 e q m 3 e q m 1 q m 31 e q m 1 the expressions 39 and 40 are the analytical expressions of integral s e in two cases and these analytical expressions are named as analytical panel integral in this paper the numerical verification of the analytical panel integral is introduced later in this chapter 3 3 numerical verification in order to validate the analytical panel integral four vertical rectangular panels parallel to the plane xoz are used the definitions and positions of four vertical rectangular panels are shown in fig 5 the panel c fig 5 c and panel d fig 5 d are generated by the downward translation of panel a fig 5 a and panel b fig 5 b by 0 01 respectively since the coordinates of points on ship hull surface are nondimensionalized in terms of ship length l s the panel b and panel d are roughly the same size as the 4 node panels used to discretize the ship hull surface while the panel a and panel c are much larger and applied to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the analytical panel integral we use s qe to represent the integral of h e over a vertical rectangular panel the analytical panel integral and gaussian integration rule are applied to calculate the integral s qe respectively according to the coordinate x of flow field point p the numerical verification is divided into three cases it should be noted that the froude number f is equal to 0 2 in all the following cases ⅰ case 1 x 0 5 in case 1 the heaviside step function is equal to 1 over all four vertical rectangular panels the real and imaginary parts of integral s qe over panels a d are illustrated in figs 6 9 respectively it can be seen from fig 6 that excellent agreement can be found between the integral results of analytical panel integral and 20 20 gauss points over panel a while 8 8 gauss points cannot obtain accurate integral results for the absolute value of k greater than 5 from fig 8 we can obtain that 8 8 gauss points can give sufficiently accurate integral results over panel c compared with the integral results obtained by analytical panel integral compared with the integral s qe over panel c the integral s qe over panel a requires more gauss points to obtain sufficiently accurate integral results the reason is that the exponential function e decay exponentially as k for the panel far from the mean free surface σf the integral results of figs 6 and 8 have shown the accuracy and efficiency of the analytical panel integral compared with the integral results calculated by the analytical panel integral it can be seen from figs 7 and 9 that 2 2 gauss points can give sufficiently accurate integral results over panel b for the absolute value of k less than 6 and over panel d for all k for the heaviside step function equal to 1 over the whole 4 node panel used to discretize the hull surface we can obtain a 2 2 gauss points can obtain almost the same integral results as those obtained by the analytical panel integral when the panel is far away from the free surface b slightly more than 2 2 gauss points are needed to approach the integral results obtained by the analytical panel integral when the panel is close to the free surface ⅱ case 2 x 0 05 in case 2 only the integral s qe over panel a is investigated where the heaviside step function needs to be classified the integral results over panel a are illustrated in fig 10 we can obtain that the integral results of 40 40 gauss points show excellent agreement with those obtained by the analytical panel integral in addition the integral results of 20 20 gauss points still have some errors with k 6 6 the integral results in fig 10 prove the correctness and necessity of the advance classification of heaviside step function ⅲ case 3 x 0 005 in case 3 only the integral s qe over panel b is calculated where the heaviside step function needs to be classified and the integral results are illustrated in fig 11 it can be obtained that the integral results of 2 2 gauss points have considerable errors and 20 20 gauss points are still insufficient to approach the integral results calculated by the analytical panel integral the integral results in fig 11 indicate that the analytical panel integral can greatly improve the calculation speed and accuracy of the integral of h e over the 4 node panel used to discretize the hull surface when the plane x x intersects this 4 node panel after obtaining the integral s h by eq 28 with the analytical panel integral the wave component φ h w of hogner potential in expression 19 can be calculated substituting eq 29 into the expression 20 the nm correction wave potential can be expressed as follows 41 ψ w 2 π f 2 0

different numerical implementation methods to compute the flow about a ship hull in calm water the filter function λ and the related cutoff wavenumber k need to be determined in advance which are considered in huang et al 2013 huang et al 2013 and noblesse et al 2013 noblesse et al 2013b in detail to remove unwanted short waves the parabolic extrapolation approach is applied by noblesse et al 2013 noblesse et al 2013b to obtain the filter function 42 λ 1 f o r z h λ e 1 k 2 h z f 2 3 3 e h e h 2 2 3 e h e h 2 z h f o r h z 0 w i t h e h e 1 k 2 h f 2 where h represents the extrapolation

zhang et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 compared with the nm lg the wave drag curve obtained by the nm lsa presents unrealistic and violent oscillations at low speeds f 0 2 when the values of filter parameters recommended in huang et al 2013 huang et al 2013 are used in addition at low speeds the number of iterations required in nm lsa increases significantly in order to avoid the above phenomenon the midship extrapolation height h m is modified from h m 2 π ε m min f 2 f t 2 which is given in noblesse et al 2013 noblesse et al 2013b to 43 h m 2 π ε m min f f t where the transition froude number f t is taken as f t 0 4 as recommended in noblesse et al 2013 noblesse et al 2013b and the value of ε m has changed compared with that recommended in huang et al 2013 huang et al 2013 the extrapolation height h b and h s are defined by noblesse et al 2013 noblesse et al 2013b as follows 44 h b 5 ε b min f 2 1 f σ h f t 2 1 f t σ h h s c s m h m where σ h is the hull slenderness and

following equations of motions 47 h c 33 θ c 35 f 3 θ c 55 h c 53 f 5 where h and θ represent sinkage and trim of ship respectively f 3 and f 5 are hydrodynamic force and pitch moment and c ij denotes restoring coefficients which can be expressed as follows 48 f i h p n d a i 1 2 3 h p r r g n d a i 4 5 6 c 33 ρ g w p d x d y c 35 c 53 ρ g w p x d x d y c 55 ρ g z c b z c g ρ g w p x 2 d x d y here r g denotes the vector pointing to the center of gravity wp is water plane z c b and z c g represent the vertical coordinates of center of buoyancy and center of gravity and is displacement volume the eq 47 is different from the equations used to obtain the sinkage and trim given in noblesse et al 2013 noblesse et al 2013a and huang et al 2013 huang et al 2013 where the center of gravity position and the coupling effects of sinkage and trim are not considered the iteration convergence error ε iter related to the iterative solution procedure 7 is defined by huang et al 2013 huang et al 2013 as

university 4 1 filter 1 the filter parameters associated with filter 1 are taken as ε b 0 04 ε m 0 02 μ b 4 μ m 5 c s m 0 7 ℓ s 0 4 two hulls the wigley hull and series 60 c b 0 60 model are considered in filter 1 the quadrilateral mesh sketches of these two hull surfaces are shown in fig 12 where the grid numbers for the positive halves of wigley hull and series 60 model are 2880 and 2862 respectively wave drag coefficients sinkage and trim of the wigley hull and series 60 model obtained by the present two numerical implementation methods and those given in huang et al 2013 huang et al 2013 as well as the experimental measurements are presented in figs 13 14 16 and 17 it can be seen that the wave drag coefficients and sinkage of two hulls calculated by the two numerical implementation methods are completely consistent and show good agreement with the experimental data and excellent agreement with the numerical results obtained by huang et al 2013 huang et al 2013 the trim of wigley hull obtained by the two numerical methods is in good agreement with the experimental data and that obtained by huang et al 2013 huang et al 2013 the trim of series 60 model obtained by the two numerical methods shows excellent agreement with the experimental measurements but presents observable difference with that obtained by huang et al 2013 huang et al 2013 as shown in fig 17 b the main reason is that the trim is obtained by solving the eq 47 in the present two numerical methods where the center of gravity position and the coupling effects of 3 mode motion sinkage and 5 mode motion trim are considered the computed and measured wave profiles of wigley hull at six froude numbers are plotted in fig 15 it can be seen from fig 15 that the wave profiles at ship bow predicted by nm theory are lower than experimental measurements the reason is that a ship bow wave is significantly higher and shorter than waves aft of the bow wave and may be significantly influenced by nonlinear effects ignored in nm theory the computed and measured wave profiles of series 60 model at eight froude numbers are plotted in fig 18 the computed wave profiles of wigley hull and series 60 model are in excellent agreement with those obtained by huang et al 2013 huang et al 2013 and in good agreement with the experimental measurements note that the filter parameters associated with filter 1 are suitable for a hull without a bulb like the wigley hull and series 60 model the time consumption of wave drag computation for wigley hull and series 60 model per froude number through the two numerical methods are presented in figs 13 b and fig 16 b where t lg and t lsa denote the time consumption via the nm lg and nm lsa respectively it should be noted that all calculations mentioned in this paper are done on a server 2 3 ghz intel xeon gold 5218 with a 60 thread openmp acceleration strategy we can obtain that when f is greater than 0 2 the time consumption of wave drag computation via the nm lsa is less than 2 s for two hulls 4 2 filter 2 the filter parameters associated with filter 2 are taken as ε b 0 02 ε m 0 045 μ b 2 μ m 4 c s m 0 8 ℓ s 0 5 three hulls the kcs hull dtmb 5415 model and fishery patrol boat are considered in filter 2 filter 2 are applied to attenuate the unrealistic oscillations in wave drag coefficient curve obtained using filter 1 for a broad ship hull with a shallow draft and a bulb like the kcs hull and dtmb 5415 model filter 2 is significantly different with filter 1 where ε b is half as small and ε m is over twice larger for filter 2 than for filter 1 thus the extrapolation height in the midship region aft of bow wave are over twice larger for filter 2 than for filter 1 in order to weaken the influence of excessive short wave filter in filter 2 on the wave drag coefficient a waterline correction which is based on the study of tarafder and suzuki 2007 tarafder and suzuki 2007 with some modifications conducted is used in the present paper as follows 50 c w ρ v s 2 l s 2 c w a v e n e a r 1 2 ρ v s 2 s w e t ρ v s 2 l s 2 γ e p n x d l ρ v s 2 s w e t where e ηf 2 denotes the elevation at waterline n x belongs to the normal vector with n z 0 at waterline p is the dynamic pressure at waterline the second term at the right side of eq 50 is the waterline correction term the quadrilateral mesh sketches of three hull surfaces are shown in fig 19 where the grid numbers for the positive halves of kcs hull dtmb 5415 model and fishery patrol boat are 2560 2900 and 2948 respectively 4 2 1 prediction results of kcs hull wave drag coefficients sinkage and trim of the kcs hull obtained by the present two numerical methods and those given in huang 2013 huang 2013 and chen 2018 chen 2018 and as well as the experimental measurements are plotted in figs 20 and 21 it can be seen that when 0 23 f 0 28 the wave drag coefficients calculated by present two numerical methods show a better agreement with the experimental measurements than those obtained by huang 2013 huang 2013 and chen 2018 chen 2018 the sinkage calculated by the two numerical methods presents a good agreement with the experimental measurements and that given in given in chen et al 2016 chen et al 2016 huang 2013 huang 2013 and the trim calculated by the two numerical methods shows a better and worse agreement with the experimental measurements than that obtained by huang 2013 huang 2013 and chen et al 2016 chen et al 2016 respectively the reason for the difference between the trim of kcs hull obtained by the two numerical methods and the experimental measurements may be excessive short wave filtering in order to obtain stable results and the nonlinear effects and visco pressure coupling effects which are ignored in the nm theory the computed and measured wave profiles of kcs hull at f 0 26 are plotted in fig 22 where the wave profile obtained by the two numerical methods show good agreement with the experimental measurements 4 2 2 prediction results of dtmb 5415 model wave drag coefficients sinkage and trim of the dtmb 5415 model calculated by the present two numerical methods and those given in huang et al 2013 huang et al 2013 as well as the experimental measurements are plotted in figs 23 and 24 it can be seen that the wave drag coefficients obtained by the two numerical methods show a better agreement with the experimental data than those given in huang et al 2013 huang et al 2013 the sinkage calculated by the present two numerical methods is in excellent agreement with that given in huang et al 2013 huang et al 2013 when f is smaller than 0 38 and in good agreement with the experimental measurements the trim calculated by the two numerical methods shows a better agreement with the experimental data than that given in huang et al 2013 huang et al 2013 when f is smaller than 0 35 when f is greater than 0 35 the sinkage and trim obtained by the two numerical methods present observable difference with the experimental measurements the reason may be that the two numerical methods proposed in the present paper cannot consider the nonlinear effects and visco pressure coupling effects at high speeds the computed and measured wave profiles of dtmb 5415 model at f 0 28 and f 0 41 are plotted in fig 25 the wave profiles obtained by the two numerical methods show a good agreement with the experimental measurements aft the bow wave 4 2 3 prediction results of fishery patrol boat the fishery patrol boat model is built in shanghai jiao tong university body plans of fishery patrol boat are shown in fig 26 and the photograph of fishery patrol boat model and experimental device is shown in fig 27 fishery patrol boat hull is a broad hull with bow flare bulb and transom stern thus the filter parameters associated with filter 2 are selected to calculate the wave drag of fishery patrol boat wave drag coefficients of the fishery patrol boat model calculated by the present two numerical methods and those given in chen et al 2016 chen et al 2016 as well as the experimental measurements are plotted in fig 28 a the experimental data of wave drag coefficient is obtained by subtracting the friction drag coefficient obtained by the ittc 1957 formula from the measured total drag coefficient from fig 28 a we can obtain that the wave drag coefficients calculated by the two numerical methods show a better agreement with the experimental data than those obtained by chen et al 2016 chen et al 2016 moreover the locations of humps and hollows on wave drag coefficient curve are well predicated by the two numerical methods the total drag r t can be expressed as follows 51 r t 0 5 ρ u s 2 s w e t c t w i t h c t c f c w where ρ denotes the density of water c t represents total drag coefficient and c f is frictional drag coefficient which can be given by the ittc 1957 model ship correlation line as follows 52 c f 0 075 log 10 re 2 2 where re is reynolds number computed and measured total resistance of fishery patrol boat model is plotted in fig 29 the computed total resistance obtained by the two numerical methods shows a good agreement with the experimental data and the relative error does not exceed 7 which has proved the accuracy of the two numerical methods proposed in the present paper the above analyses on the numerical results of three hulls kcs hull dtmb 5415 model and fishery patrol boat have further proved the accuracy of the two numerical methods given in this paper in addition the analyses on wave drag coefficients of three hulls have proved the accuracy of the waterline correction the filter parameters associated with filter 2 are suitable for a broad hull with a shallow draft and a bulb like the kcs hull and dtmb 5415 model when using the filter parameters associated with filter 2 the waterline correction term for the wave drag coefficient needs to be included for three hulls considered in filter 2 the wave drag coefficients obtained by the nm lsa are smaller than those obtained by the nm lg moreover the numerical results of wave drag coefficients obtained by the two numerical methods are in good agreement with the experimental measurements and the accuracy of wave drag evaluation via the two numerical methods is roughly the same the time consumption of wave drag computation for the three hulls per froude number through the two numerical methods are plotted in fig 20 b 23 b and 28 b when the froude number is greater than 0 2 the time consumption of wave drag computation for the three hulls via the nm lsa is less than 2 s which is consistent with the time consumption of wigely hull and series 60 model moreover for almost all froude numbers of five hulls the time ratio t lsa t lg is less than 0 6 which is consistent with the results of efficiency analysis of the analytical panel integral in section 3 3 then the total time consumption of hull form optimization where the wave drag is calculated by the nm lsa can save about 40 compared with that of hull form optimization with the wave drag calculated by the nm lg thus compared with the nm lg the nm lsa has considerable advantages in time consumption especially when the method is used for optimization for the present two numerical methods when f is less than 0 2 the time consumption of wave drag calculation decreases as f increases the reason is that when f decreases the pseudo period of fourier kochin representations 19 and 20 will decrease and gauss points that need to be distributed on 0 k will increase it should be noted that all the grid numbers of five hulls are verified by convergence analysis which is not shown in the present paper moreover accurate results can be obtained using about 2500 3000 4 node panels of non uniform sizes adapted to the variation of the hull surface geometry 5 conclusions in the present paper the numerical implementation method of the nm theory by using linear gauss method for panel integral is first established for ship waves then for the numerical problem that the wave component w in the green function g is an oscillatory function with respect to spatial variables x and y another numerical implementation method of the nm theory incorporating with the analytical panel integral related to the elementary wave e is given in the two different numerical methods since the local flow component l in the green function g is not an oscillatory function over space the local flow component in the hogner potential is calculated by the traditional gaussian quadrature the difference between the two numerical methods lies in the numerical implementation strategy of spatial integration for the wave potential where the gaussian quadrature is used in the nm lg and the analytical panel integral is used in the nm lsa the numerical verification results have presented the correctness and efficiency of the analytical panel integral the simulation results of ship waves of the five hulls with specific filter parameters have shown the accuracy of the present two numerical methods the filter parameters associated with filter 1 are suitable for hull forms without bulbs like the wigley hull and series 60 model the filter parameters associated with filter 2 are suitable for hull forms with broad breadths and shallow drafts like the kcs hull and dtmb 5415 model where the hull forms also contain bulbs through the use of the analytical panel integral the time consumption of wave drag computation by the nm lsa is approximately equal to 60 of that by the nm lg which has shown the considerable advantage in time consumption of the nm lsa compared to the nm lg moreover the time consumption of wave drag computation via the nm lsa is less than 2 s during the froude number is greater than 0 2 which is very meaningful for hull form optimization credit authorship contribution statement le zha writing original draft investigation methodology software

is a boundary integral equation method which is discretized by using 4 node isoparametric elements with linear flow potential distribution in this paper to overcome the difficulty of panel integral of wave component in the green function the nm lsa employs the analytical panel integral related to the elementary wave the filter function based on parabolic extrapolation within a layer bordering the free surface is used to remove unwanted short waves the analytical panel integral of elementary wave over a triangular panel is derived and applied to compute the spatial integral of wave potential in addition another numerical implementation approach named nm lg of the nm theory by using linear gauss method for panel integral is established two sets of filter parameters and five hulls are selected to validate the above mentioned numerical methods the simulation results obtained by different numerical methods show good agreement with experimental measurements moreover the time consumption of wave drag computation per froude number via the nm lsa is reduced by about 40 compared to that via the nm lg keywords ship waves numerical implementation neumann michell theory analytical panel integral linear boundary element method 1 introduction free surface flow due to a ship steadily advancing at constant speed in calm water of effectively infinite depth and lateral extent called ship waves is a classical ship hydrodynamic problem that has been widely studied for many decades the yield results of ship waves are considerable practical importance for ship design at early stage especially for hull form optimization it is very benefit for engineer to learn the trend of ship drag with hull form deformation for the sake of engineering application a numerical method of high efficiency and accuracy at low cost to study ship waves is needed generally potential flow methods that rely on the boundary integral equation method incorporating with a green function method are considered usually there are two types of green functions used to study ship waves one is rankine source green function that only satisfies laplace equation the other is havelock free surface source green function which satisfies laplace equation kelvin michell linearized free surface condition and radiation condition rankine source method was first applied by dawson 1977 dawson 1977 to solve ship waves the nonlinear effects chen et al 2016 chen et al 2016 of free surface and hull boundary can be considered in rankine source method while the rankine sources are required to be distributed on all flow boundaries of fluid domain as for havelock source green function methods the sources or dipoles only need to be distributed on ship hull surface the neumann kelvin nk theory proposed by brard 1972 brard 1972 and guevel et al 1974 guevel et al 1974 is a typical free surface green function method which consists of a troublesome waterline integral the integrand of this waterline integral is gφ x φg x which has been eliminated in the neumann michell nm theory noblesse et al 2013 noblesse et al 2013a huang et al 2013 huang et al 2013 yang et al 2013 yang et al 2013 by the following two steps ⅰ deriving the nm consistent linear flow model through linearization and the integrand term gφ x does not appear within this consistent linear flow model ⅱ applying a mathematical transformation and a practical simplification to eliminate the integrand term φg x the wave drag coefficients sinkage trim and wave profiles huang et al 2013 huang et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 computed by the nm theory show overall good agreement with the experiment measurements which have verified the accuracy of nm theory however most of the numerical implementation methods of the nm theory were based on low order panel approach where the half of mean wetted hull surface was approximated by about 8000 10000 triangular flat panels as expounded by huang et al 2013 huang et al 2013 the mathematical expressions given by noblesse et al 2013 noblesse et al 2013a are not sufficient to fully determine the nm theory and the numerical implementation of the nm theory is an essential element of this theory then the numerical implementation method of the nm theory by using linear gauss method for panel integral called nm lg is first established in this paper in the nm lg the number of gauss points that need to be distributed on the 4 node panels used to discretize the mean wetted hull surface is numerically studied for the numerical problem that the wave component w in the green function g is an oscillatory function with respect to spatial variables x and y the analytical panel integral related to the elementary wave e is derived and numerically verified then another numerical implementation method of the nm theory incorporating with this analytical panel integral called nm lsa is established for ship waves in the nm lsa the analytical panel integral is applied to compute the spatial integral of wave potential both numerical implementation methods are derived based on the linear boundary element method in the two numerical implementation methods the half of mean wetted hull surface is discretized by a series of 4 node isoparametric panels elements when the total number of nodes of discrete grids is the same the number of unknown variables of the discrete boundary integral equations by using the linear boundary element method based on 4 node panels is approximately equal to half of that by using the low order boundary element method based on flat triangular panels where the unknown variable is the velocity potential at flow field point p five hulls wigley hull series 60 model kcs hull dtmb 5415 model and fishery patrol boat and two sets of filter parameters filter 1 and filter 2 are selected to validate the two numerical methods given in this paper the simulation results of five hulls show good agreement with the experiment measurements which verifies the accuracy of the present two numerical methods moreover the time consumption of wave drag calculation for five hulls has verified the efficiency of two numerical methods and the advantage of the nm lsa in time consumption 2 the neumann michell theory for ship waves as shown in fig 1 a right handed moving coordinate system o xyz attached to the ship hull of length l s is established where the x axis points toward the ship bow the z axis is vertical upward the origin is located on the undisturbed free surface z 0 and n n x n y n z denotes the unit normal vector of the hull surface and points into the water in this moving coordinate system the total flow velocity can be regarded as the sum of a uniform current v s 0 0 opposing the ship speed and the disturbance flow velocity u u x u y u z due to the ship the nondimensional coordinates x x y z flow velocity u u x u y u z and flow potential φ can be defined as follows 1 x x l s u u v s φ φ v s l s the point p

is the hogner potential proposed by hogner 1932 hogner 1932 and can be decomposed into a local component φ h l and a wave component φ h w in corresponding to the decomposition of the green function g l w the hogner potential can be expressed as follows 4 φ h h g n x d a f g π φ d x d y w i t h π φ φ z f 2 φ x x where σh σf denote the mean wetted ship hull surface and mean free surface respectively the nm correction potential ψ w which is defined by noblesse et al 2013 noblesse et al 2013a is expressed as follows 5 ψ w h d z w y x d y w z x φ t t y w z x t z w y x φ d d a here the derivatives φ

local flow component in the hogner potential substituting the local flow component l for the green function g in eq 4 the local flow component φ h l in the hogner potential can be obtained as follows 8 φ h l h l n x d a f l π φ d x d y w i t h l l r e g where l reg denotes a regularized local flow component that is related to the singular local flow component l in the green function g in accordance with noblesse et al 2011 noblesse et al 2011 for typical displacement ships the linear kelvin michell boundary condition π φ 0 is assumed to hold for everywhere at the mean free surface σf the approximate expression of l reg is given by noblesse et al 2013 noblesse et al 2013a 2 3 wave component in the flow potential the wave component w in the green function g is defined by the fourier

noblesse et al 2011 and used to filter unrealistic short waves the functions e and e are elementary waves substituting the wave component w for the green function g in eq 4 the wave component φ h w of hogner potential φ h can be expressed as follows 10 φ h w h w n x d a f w π φ d x d y in order to get appreciably higher and sharper bow waves for flow field point p within the bow region of ship hull surface σh the wave component φ h w is evaluated at the ship centerplane y 0 in accordance with noblesse et al 2013 noblesse et al 2013a where the wave component φ h w of hogner potential is modified as follows 11 φ h w h w x ϕ y z q n q x d a q w i t h ϕ 1 exp 0 3 0 5 x 2 f 4 here the linear kelvin michell boundary condition π φ 0 at the mean free surface σf is used and the subscript q represents

respectively according to noblesse et al 2013 noblesse et al 2013a for the common case of a ship hull with port and starboard symmetry expressions 13 and 15 become 16 s h 2 f 2 σ h h n x e z c y c x i

linear boundary element method the numerical implementation strategy of wave integral for fourier kochin representations 19 and 20 can refer to the research of noblesse et al 2011 noblesse et al 2011 where the pseudo period of the oscillations is calculated and gaussian integration rule is applied the spatial integration strategy of the wave spectrum function s h and s ψ over the ship hull surface σh is the main objective of this paper and considered as follow 2 4 1 numerical implementation of local flow component in the hogner potential the local flow component in the hogner potential can be directly calculated using boundary element method different from the numerical implementation of huang et al 2013 huang et al 2013 where the hull surface σh is discretized by a set of flat triangular panels and low order panel method is applied to calculate potential we use a set of 4 node isoparametric elements to discretize the hull surface and apply linear boundary element method to calculate potential by introducing the shape functions n j s c the 3d 4 node element is mapped into a 2d parametric s c plane as shown in fig 2 a and the potential or geometrical variable can be written as follows 22 χ j 1 4 n j s c χ j w i t h n j s c 1 4 1 s j s 1 c j c here χ denotes the potential φ or geometrical variable x y z s and c are coordinates in s c plane j denote nodal number s j and c j are parametric coordinate values the shape functions of a 4 node isoparametric element are shown in fig 2 b after the isoparametric transformation we can obtain 23 φ h l h l r e g n x d a e 1 2 n e δ s e l r e g n x d a e 1 2 n e 1 1 1 1 l r e g p q s c n q s c x j s c d s d c where δs e denote 4 node panels n e is the total number of panels on the half ship hull surface σh and j s c denote jacobian determinant by distributing a few gauss points on the standard square element the local flow component φ h l can be calculated easily 2 4 2 numerical implementation of wave component in the flow potential same as local flow component in the hogner potential the wave spectrum function s h in eq 16 can be further expressed as follows 24 s h 2 f 2 e 1 n e δ s e h n x e z c y c x i s x d a 2 f 2 e 1 n e 1 1 1 1 h n q s c x e q s c z c q s c y c q s c x i s q s c x j s c d s d c where subscript q s c represents the variable value at the boundary point q determined by parameter coordinates s c after obtaining the wave spectrum function s h by eq 24 the wave component φ h w in the hogner potential can be calculated by eq 19 unlike the hogner potential the nm correction wave potential includes the derivatives φ t and φ d of potential φ which are not known at the onset thus the nm correction wave potential needs to be calculated at each iteration in order to simplify the iterative calculation and accelerate the iterative convergence speed the derivatives φ t and φ d are assumed to be constant within a 4 node panel then expression 17 yields 25 s ψ 2 f 2 e 1 n e φ t δ s e h e z q t s x i c x d a φ d δ s e h e z q d s x i c x d a 2 f 2 e 1 n e φ t 1 1 1 1 h e q s c z q t q s c s q s c x i c q s c x j s c d s d c φ d 1 1 1 1 h e q s c z q d q s c s q s c x i c q s c x j s c d s d c then the nm correction wave potential can be expressed as follows 26 ψ w 4 π f 2 0 k λ e 1 k 2 z f 2 c y e 1 n e s x s r e t e c x s i m t e φ t s x s r e d e c x s i m d e φ d d k with 27 s r e t

1 h e q s c z q d q s c c q s c x j s c d s d c it can be seen from eq 26 that all variables except φ t and φ d are known at the onset then the iterative coefficients can be constructed and these coefficients remain unchanged during the iterative process the above mentioned method for panel integral which is based on the linear boundary element method and gaussian quadrature is called linear gauss method in this paper and the numerical implementation approach of the nm theory by using linear gauss method for panel integral is named nm lg in this paper it can be seen from eq 9 that the wave component w contains the elementary wave e which is an oscillatory function with respect to spatial variables x and y thus in nm lg where the gaussian quadrature rule is applied to calculate the integrals s h and s ψ some numerical errors will be produced in the integrals s h and s ψ more gaussian points distributed on the standard square element can get smaller numerical error but will lead to an increase in time consumption to reduce the numerical errors and time consumption simultaneously the analytical panel integral that is the integral of elementary wave e over a triangular panel is derived later in the present paper 3 analytical panel integral related to the elementary wave e in order to derive the analytical panel integral related to the elementary wave e a 4 node panel is divided into two triangular panels and expressions 13 and 15 yield 28 s h 1 f 2 e 1 2 n e j 1 2 n t r i x t r i h ed a s re h i s im h 29 s ψ 1 f 2 e 1 2 n e j 1 2 k t φ t k d φ d t r i t r i h ed a s re ψ i s im ψ where j is used to distinguish two triangular panels and subscript tri represents the value of variable or variable combination over a triangular panel it should be noted that the flow velocities φ t and φ d are constant over a triangular panel when the flow potential φ changes linearly over the triangular panel in addition k t k d and n x are determined by the unit normal vector n of triangular panel thus the terms n x and k t φ t k d φ d are constant over a triangular panel and can be extracted out from the integral over a triangular panel it can be seen from expressions 28 and 29 that the key to calculate the integrals s h and s ψ lies in the integral s e which can be expressed as follows 30 s e t r i h ed a 3 1 coordinate transformations before deriving the analytical panel integral related to the elementary wave e a coordinate transformation proposed by huang et al 2020 huang et al 2020 where the triangular panel is mapped into a unit rectangle in ξoη plane is performed as shown in fig 3 line ab is parallel to side 23 point q is located on line ab the length of side 23 line ab and line aq are l 0 ηl 0 and ξ ab respectively thus point a b and q in ξoη plane can be expressed as follows 31 r a r 1 η r 2 r 1 r b r 1 η r 3 r 1 r q r 1 η r 2 r 1 ξ η r 3 r 2 where r l x l y l z l l 1 2 3 are the coordinates of three vertices of the triangle and thus 0 ξ 1 0 η 1 the integral of a function f x y z over a triangular panel can be further expressed as follows 32 s f t r i f x y z d a 0 1 0 1 f ξ η j ξ η d η d ξ here the jacobian determinant j ξ η can be expressed as follows 33 j ξ η r q ξ r q η 2 η s 0 where s 0 denotes the area of the triangular panel 3 2 analytical expression of the integral s e there is a heaviside step function h x x in the integral s e which will bring trouble to the derivation of analytical expression for the integral s e thus the heaviside step function needs to be classified in advance the value of heaviside step function over a triangular panel is determined by the relative position between the flow field point p and the triangular panel as shown in fig 4 the relative position can be classified into three situations ⅰ the coordinates x of three vertices of triangular panel are all greater than the coordinate x of flow field point p in accordance with fig 4 a and the heaviside step function equal to 1 over the whole triangular panel ⅱ the coordinates x of three vertices are all less than the coordinate x in accordance with fig 4 b and the heaviside step function equal to 0 over the whole triangular panel ⅲ the plane x x intersects with the triangular panel in accordance with fig 4 c and d in this case according to the location of this intersection one fig 4 c or two fig 4 d new triangular panels can be generated based on the original triangular panel and the heaviside step function equal to 1 over the new triangular panel through the above classification the heaviside step function in the integral s e can be removed and the integral s e can be further expressed as follows 34 s e t r i e d a 2 s 0 0 1 η d η 0 1 e q m d ξ w i t h q m m r q where m i 1 k 2 f 2 i 1 k 2 k f 2 1 k 2 f 2 and r q x y z multiplying the both sides of eq 31 by m we can obtain 35 q m a q m 1 η q m 2 q m 1 q m b q m 1 η q m 3 q m 1 q m q m 1 η q m 2 q m 1 ξ η q m 3 q m 2 with q m l 1 k 2 z l f 2 i 1 k 2 x l k y l f 2 l 1 2 3 expression 35 can further yield 36 d q m a d η q m 21 d q m b d η q m 31 d q m d ξ η q m 32 w i t h q m 21 q m 2 q m 1 q m 31 q m 3 q m 1 q m 32 q m 3 q m 2 when the above three partial derivatives in eq 36 are equal to 0 the following equation can be obtained 37 q m 32 1 k 2 z 3 z 2 f 2 i 1 k 2 x 3 x 2 k y 3 y 2 f 2 0 q m 31 1 k 2 z 3 z 1 f 2 i 1 k 2 x 3 x 1 k y 3 y 1 f 2 0 q m 21 1 k 2 z 2 z 1 f 2 i 1 k 2 x 2 x 1 k y 2 y 1 f 2 0 the eq 37 can further yield 38 z 3 z 2 x 3 x 2 y 3 y 2 k z 3 z 1 x 3 x 1 y 3 y 1 k z 2 z 1 x 2 x 1 y 2 y 1 k it can be seen from eq 38 that if any two of the three partial derivatives in eq 36 are equal to 0 the coordinates z of three vertices of triangular panel must be equal to each other and the corresponding two sides of the triangular panel must be parallel to each other with the same slope k thus only one of the three partial derivatives in eq 36 may be equal to 0 when one of the three partial derivatives is equal to 0 the partial derivative that equal to 0 can be adjusted to q m 21 by swapping the order of three vertices of the triangular panel according to whether q m 21 is equal to 0 the calculation of integral s e is divided into two cases ⅰ d q m a d η q m 21 0 the integral s e can be expressed as follows 39 s e 2 s 0 0 1 η d η 0 1 e q m d ξ 2 s 0 q m 32 0 1 d η q m a q m b e q m d q m 2 s 0 q m 32 0 1 e q m b e q m a d η 2 s 0 q m 32 e q m b η 0 η 1 q m 31 e q m a η 0 η 1 q m 21 2 s 0 q m 32 e q m 3 e q m 1 q m 31 e q m 2 e q m 1 q m 21 ⅱ d q m a d η q m 21 0 the integral s e can be expressed as follows 40 s e 2 s 0 q m 32 0 1 e q m b e q m a d η 2 s 0 q m 32 e q m b η 0 η 1 q m 31 e q m 1 η 0 1 2 s 0 q m 32 e q m 3 e q m 1 q m 31 e q m 1 the expressions 39 and 40 are the analytical expressions of integral s e in two cases and these analytical expressions are named as analytical panel integral in this paper the numerical verification of the analytical panel integral is introduced later in this chapter 3 3 numerical verification in order to validate the analytical panel integral four vertical rectangular panels parallel to the plane xoz are used the definitions and positions of four vertical rectangular panels are shown in fig 5 the panel c fig 5 c and panel d fig 5 d are generated by the downward translation of panel a fig 5 a and panel b fig 5 b by 0 01 respectively since the coordinates of points on ship hull surface are nondimensionalized in terms of ship length l s the panel b and panel d are roughly the same size as the 4 node panels used to discretize the ship hull surface while the panel a and panel c are much larger and applied to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the analytical panel integral we use s qe to represent the integral of h e over a vertical rectangular panel the analytical panel integral and gaussian integration rule are applied to calculate the integral s qe respectively according to the coordinate x of flow field point p the numerical verification is divided into three cases it should be noted that the froude number f is equal to 0 2 in all the following cases ⅰ case 1 x 0 5 in case 1 the heaviside step function is equal to 1 over all four vertical rectangular panels the real and imaginary parts of integral s qe over panels a d are illustrated in figs 6 9 respectively it can be seen from fig 6 that excellent agreement can be found between the integral results of analytical panel integral and 20 20 gauss points over panel a while 8 8 gauss points cannot obtain accurate integral results for the absolute value of k greater than 5 from fig 8 we can obtain that 8 8 gauss points can give sufficiently accurate integral results over panel c compared with the integral results obtained by analytical panel integral compared with the integral s qe over panel c the integral s qe over panel a requires more gauss points to obtain sufficiently accurate integral results the reason is that the exponential function e decay exponentially as k for the panel far from the mean free surface σf the integral results of figs 6 and 8 have shown the accuracy and efficiency of the analytical panel integral compared with the integral results calculated by the analytical panel integral it can be seen from figs 7 and 9 that 2 2 gauss points can give sufficiently accurate integral results over panel b for the absolute value of k less than 6 and over panel d for all k for the heaviside step function equal to 1 over the whole 4 node panel used to discretize the hull surface we can obtain a 2 2 gauss points can obtain almost the same integral results as those obtained by the analytical panel integral when the panel is far away from the free surface b slightly more than 2 2 gauss points are needed to approach the integral results obtained by the analytical panel integral when the panel is close to the free surface ⅱ case 2 x 0 05 in case 2 only the integral s qe over panel a is investigated where the heaviside step function needs to be classified the integral results over panel a are illustrated in fig 10 we can obtain that the integral results of 40 40 gauss points show excellent agreement with those obtained by the analytical panel integral in addition the integral results of 20 20 gauss points still have some errors with k 6 6 the integral results in fig 10 prove the correctness and necessity of the advance classification of heaviside step function ⅲ case 3 x 0 005 in case 3 only the integral s qe over panel b is calculated where the heaviside step function needs to be classified and the integral results are illustrated in fig 11 it can be obtained that the integral results of 2 2 gauss points have considerable errors and 20 20 gauss points are still insufficient to approach the integral results calculated by the analytical panel integral the integral results in fig 11 indicate that the analytical panel integral can greatly improve the calculation speed and accuracy of the integral of h e over the 4 node panel used to discretize the hull surface when the plane x x intersects this 4 node panel after obtaining the integral s h by eq 28 with the analytical panel integral the wave component φ h w of hogner potential in expression 19 can be calculated substituting eq 29 into the expression 20 the nm correction wave potential can be expressed as follows 41 ψ w 2 π f 2 0 k λ e 1 k 2 z f 2 c y e 1 2 n e j 1 2 t a φ t d a φ d d k w i t h t a s x re k t s e c x im k t s e d a s x re k d s e c x im k d s e the above mentioned method for panel integral where the wave integral is calculated by the gaussian quadrature and the spatial integral is calculated by using the analytical panel integral is called linear semi analytical method in this paper then the numerical implementation approach of the nm theory by using linear semi analytical method for panel integral is named nm lsa in this paper 4 illustrative application and validation before using the above different numerical implementation methods to compute the flow about a ship hull in calm water the filter function λ and the related cutoff wavenumber k need to be determined in advance which are considered in huang et al 2013 huang et al 2013 and noblesse et al 2013 noblesse et al 2013b in detail to remove unwanted short waves the parabolic extrapolation approach is applied by noblesse et al 2013 noblesse et al 2013b to obtain the filter function 42 λ 1 f o r z h λ e 1 k 2 h z f 2 3 3 e h e h 2 2 3 e h e h 2 z h f o r h z 0 w i t h e h e 1 k 2 h f 2 where h represents the extrapolation height which determined by a set of filter parameters ε b ε m μ b μ m c s m ℓ s recommended in noblesse et al 2013 noblesse et al 2013b the cutoff wavenumber is taken as k 10f 2 as recommended in zhang et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 compared with the nm lg the wave drag curve obtained by the nm lsa presents unrealistic and violent oscillations at low speeds f 0 2 when the values of filter parameters recommended in huang et al 2013 huang et al 2013 are used in addition at low speeds the number of iterations required in nm lsa increases significantly in order to avoid the above phenomenon the midship extrapolation height h m is modified from h m 2 π ε m min f 2 f t 2 which is given in noblesse et al 2013 noblesse et al 2013b to 43 h m 2 π ε m min f f t where the transition froude number f t is taken as f t 0 4 as recommended in noblesse et al 2013 noblesse et al 2013b and the value of ε m has changed compared with that recommended in huang et al 2013 huang et al 2013 the extrapolation height h b and h s are defined by noblesse et al 2013 noblesse et al 2013b as follows 44 h b 5 ε b min f 2 1 f σ h f t 2 1 f t σ h h s c s m h m where σ h is the hull slenderness and defined in noblesse et al 2013 noblesse et al 2013b the nondimensional dynamic pressure p is determined using the bernoulli relation 45 p φ x φ x 2 φ y 2 φ z 2 2 the wave drag and wave profile are defined by noblesse et al 2013 noblesse et al 2013a and the wave drag coefficient is defined as follows 46 c w r w 1 2 ρ v s 2 s w e t ρ v s 2 l s 2 c w a v e n e a r 1 2 ρ v s 2 s w e t where r w and s wet denote the wave drag and the area of the mean wetted hull surface c w a v e n e a r is given in noblesse et al 2013 noblesse et al 2013a in this paper the sinkage and trim are solved by the following equations of motions 47 h c 33 θ c 35 f 3 θ c 55 h c 53 f 5 where h and θ represent sinkage and trim of ship respectively f 3 and f 5 are hydrodynamic force and pitch moment and c ij denotes restoring coefficients which can be expressed as follows 48 f i h p n d a i 1 2 3 h p r r g n d a i 4 5 6 c 33 ρ g w p d x d y c 35 c 53 ρ g w p x d x d y c 55 ρ g z c b z c g ρ g w p x 2 d x d y here r g denotes the vector pointing to the center of gravity wp is water plane z c b and z c g represent the vertical coordinates of center of buoyancy and center of gravity and is displacement volume the eq 47 is different from the equations used to obtain the sinkage and trim given in noblesse et al 2013 noblesse et al 2013a and huang et al 2013 huang et al 2013 where the center of gravity position and the coupling effects of sinkage and trim are not considered the iteration convergence error ε iter related to the iterative solution procedure 7 is defined by huang et al 2013 huang et al 2013 as follows 49 ε i t e r i 1 n n o d e φ t k 1 i φ t k i φ d k 1 i φ d k i i 1 n n o d e φ t k 1 i φ d k 1 i w i t h ε i t e r 0 1 here n node is the total number of nodes on the half ship hull for purposes of illustration and validation two sets of filter parameters are selected to compute the flow about five hulls five hulls are the wigley hull series 60 model kcs hull dtmb 5415 model and fishery patrol boat the principal dimensions including center of gravity position x cg and z cg for these hulls are listed in table 1 experimental measurements for the wigley hull series 60 model and dtmb 5415 are given in mccarthy 1985 mccarthy 1985 ittc 1983 experimental data for the 1983 ittc 1986 experimental data for the 1986 olivieri et al 2001 olivieri et al 2001 experimental measurements for the kcs hull are given in van et al 2000 van et al 2000 van 1998 van 1998 kim et al 2001 kim et al 2001 the model test about fishery patrol boat is carried out in towing tank at shanghai jiao tong university 4 1 filter 1 the filter parameters associated with filter 1 are taken as ε b 0 04 ε m 0 02 μ b 4 μ m 5 c s m 0 7 ℓ s 0 4 two hulls the wigley hull and series 60 c b 0 60 model are considered in filter 1 the quadrilateral mesh sketches of these two hull surfaces are shown in fig 12 where the grid numbers for the positive halves of wigley hull and series 60 model are 2880 and 2862 respectively wave drag coefficients sinkage and trim of the wigley hull and series 60 model obtained by the present two numerical implementation methods and those given in huang et al 2013 huang et al 2013 as well as the experimental measurements are presented in figs 13 14 16 and 17 it can be seen that the wave drag coefficients and sinkage of two hulls calculated by the two numerical implementation methods are completely consistent and show good agreement with the experimental data and excellent agreement with the numerical results obtained by huang et al 2013 huang et al 2013 the trim of wigley hull obtained by the two numerical methods is in good agreement with the experimental data and that obtained by huang et al 2013 huang et al 2013 the trim of series 60 model obtained by the two numerical methods shows excellent agreement with the experimental measurements but presents observable difference with that obtained by huang et al 2013 huang et al 2013 as shown in fig 17 b the main reason is that the trim is obtained by solving the eq 47 in the present two numerical methods where the center of gravity position and the coupling effects of 3 mode motion sinkage and 5 mode motion trim are considered the computed and measured wave profiles of wigley hull at six froude numbers are plotted in fig 15 it can be seen from fig 15 that the wave profiles at ship bow predicted by nm theory are lower than experimental measurements the reason is that a ship bow wave is significantly higher and shorter than waves aft of the bow wave and may be significantly influenced by nonlinear effects ignored in nm theory the computed and measured wave profiles of series 60 model at eight froude numbers are plotted in fig 18 the computed wave profiles of wigley hull and series 60 model are in excellent agreement with those obtained by huang et al 2013 huang et al 2013 and in good agreement with the experimental measurements note that the filter parameters associated with filter 1 are suitable for a hull without a bulb like the wigley hull and series 60 model the time consumption of wave drag computation for wigley hull and series 60 model per froude number through the two numerical methods are presented in figs 13 b and fig 16 b where t lg and t lsa denote the time consumption via the nm lg and nm lsa respectively it should be noted that all calculations mentioned in this paper are done on a server 2 3 ghz intel xeon gold 5218 with a 60 thread openmp acceleration strategy we can obtain that when f is greater than 0 2 the time consumption of wave drag computation via the nm lsa is less than 2 s for two hulls 4 2 filter 2 the filter parameters associated with filter 2 are taken as ε b 0 02 ε m 0 045 μ b 2 μ m 4 c s m 0 8 ℓ s 0 5 three hulls the kcs hull dtmb 5415 model and fishery patrol boat are considered in filter 2 filter 2 are applied to attenuate the unrealistic oscillations in wave drag coefficient curve obtained using filter 1 for a broad ship hull with a shallow draft and a bulb like the kcs hull and dtmb 5415 model filter 2 is significantly different with filter 1 where ε b is half as small and ε m is over twice larger for filter 2 than for filter 1 thus the extrapolation height in the midship region aft of bow wave are over twice larger for filter 2 than for filter 1 in order to weaken the influence of excessive short wave filter in filter 2 on the wave drag coefficient a waterline correction which is based on the study of tarafder and suzuki 2007 tarafder and suzuki 2007 with some modifications conducted is used in the present paper as follows 50 c w ρ v s 2 l s 2 c w a v e n e a r 1 2 ρ v s 2 s w e t ρ v s 2 l s 2 γ e p n x d l ρ v s 2 s w e t where e ηf 2 denotes the elevation at waterline n x belongs to the normal vector with n z 0 at waterline p is the dynamic pressure at waterline the second term at the right side of eq 50 is the waterline correction term the quadrilateral mesh sketches of three hull surfaces are shown in fig 19 where the grid numbers for the positive halves of kcs hull dtmb 5415 model and fishery patrol boat are 2560 2900 and 2948 respectively 4 2 1 prediction results of kcs hull wave drag coefficients sinkage and trim of the kcs hull obtained by the present two numerical methods and those given in huang 2013 huang 2013 and chen 2018 chen 2018 and as well as the experimental measurements are plotted in figs 20 and 21 it can be seen that when 0 23 f 0 28 the wave drag coefficients calculated by present two numerical methods show a better agreement with the experimental measurements than those obtained by huang 2013 huang 2013 and chen 2018 chen 2018 the sinkage calculated by the two numerical methods presents a good agreement with the experimental measurements and that given in given in chen et al 2016 chen et al 2016 huang 2013 huang 2013 and the trim calculated by the two numerical methods shows a better and worse agreement with the experimental measurements than that obtained by huang 2013 huang 2013 and chen et al 2016 chen et al 2016 respectively the reason for the difference between the trim of kcs hull obtained by the two numerical methods and the experimental measurements may be excessive short wave filtering in order to obtain stable results and the nonlinear effects and visco pressure coupling effects which are ignored in the nm theory the computed and measured wave profiles of kcs hull at f 0 26 are plotted in fig 22 where the wave profile obtained by the two numerical methods show good agreement with the experimental measurements 4 2 2 prediction results of dtmb 5415 model wave drag coefficients sinkage and trim of the dtmb 5415 model calculated by the present two numerical methods and those given in huang et al 2013 huang et al 2013 as well as the experimental measurements are plotted in figs 23 and 24 it can be seen that the wave drag coefficients obtained by the two numerical methods show a better agreement with the experimental data than those given in huang et al 2013 huang et al 2013 the sinkage calculated by the present two numerical methods is in excellent agreement with that given in huang et al 2013 huang et al 2013 when f is smaller than 0 38 and in good agreement with the experimental measurements the trim calculated by the two numerical methods shows a better agreement with the experimental data than that given in huang et al 2013 huang et al 2013 when f is smaller than 0 35 when f is greater than 0 35 the sinkage and trim obtained by the two numerical methods present observable difference with the experimental measurements the reason may be that the two numerical methods proposed in the present paper cannot consider the nonlinear effects and visco pressure coupling effects at high speeds the computed and measured wave profiles of dtmb 5415 model at f 0 28 and f 0 41 are plotted in fig 25 the wave profiles obtained by the two numerical methods show a good agreement with the experimental measurements aft the bow wave 4 2 3 prediction results of fishery patrol boat the fishery patrol boat model is built in shanghai jiao tong university body plans of fishery patrol boat are shown in fig 26 and the photograph of fishery patrol boat model and experimental device is shown in fig 27 fishery patrol boat hull is a broad hull with bow flare bulb and transom stern thus the filter parameters associated with filter 2 are selected to calculate the wave drag of fishery patrol boat wave drag coefficients of the fishery patrol boat model calculated by the present two numerical methods and those given in chen et al 2016 chen et al 2016 as well as the experimental measurements are plotted in fig 28 a the experimental data of wave drag coefficient is obtained by subtracting the friction drag coefficient obtained by the ittc 1957 formula from the measured total drag coefficient from fig 28 a we can obtain that the wave drag coefficients calculated by the two numerical methods show a better agreement with the experimental data than those obtained by chen et al 2016 chen et al 2016 moreover the locations of humps and hollows on wave drag coefficient curve are well predicated by the two numerical methods the total drag r t can be expressed as follows 51 r t 0 5 ρ u s 2 s w e t c t w i t h c t c f c w where ρ denotes the density of water c t represents total drag coefficient and c f is frictional drag coefficient which can be given by the ittc 1957 model ship correlation line as follows 52 c f 0 075 log 10 re 2 2 where re is reynolds number computed and measured total resistance of fishery patrol boat model is plotted in fig 29 the computed total resistance obtained by the two numerical methods shows a good agreement with the experimental data and the relative error does not exceed 7 which has proved the accuracy of the two numerical methods proposed in the present paper the above analyses on the numerical results of three hulls kcs hull dtmb 5415 model and fishery patrol boat have further proved the accuracy of the two numerical methods given in this paper in addition the analyses on wave drag coefficients of three hulls have proved the accuracy of the waterline correction the filter parameters associated with filter 2 are suitable for a broad hull with a shallow draft and a bulb like the kcs hull and dtmb 5415 model when using the filter parameters associated with filter 2 the waterline correction term for the wave drag coefficient needs to be included for three hulls considered in filter 2 the wave drag coefficients obtained by the nm lsa are smaller than those obtained by the nm lg moreover the numerical results of wave drag coefficients obtained by the two numerical methods are in good agreement with the experimental measurements and the accuracy of wave drag evaluation via the two numerical methods is roughly the same the time consumption of wave drag computation for the three hulls per froude number through the two numerical methods are plotted in fig 20 b 23 b and 28 b when the froude number is greater than 0 2 the time consumption of wave drag computation for the three hulls via the nm lsa is less than 2 s which is consistent with the time consumption of wigely hull and series 60 model moreover for almost all froude numbers of five hulls the time ratio t lsa t lg is less than 0 6 which is consistent with the results of efficiency analysis of the analytical panel integral in section 3 3 then the total time consumption of hull form optimization where the wave drag is calculated by the nm lsa can save about 40 compared with that of hull form optimization with the wave drag calculated by the nm lg thus compared with the nm lg the nm lsa has considerable advantages in time consumption especially when the method is used for optimization for the present two numerical methods when f is less than 0 2 the time consumption of wave drag calculation decreases as f increases the reason is that when f decreases the pseudo period of fourier kochin representations 19 and 20 will decrease and gauss points that need to be distributed on 0 k will increase it should be noted that all the grid numbers of five hulls are verified by convergence analysis which is not shown in the present paper moreover accurate results can be obtained using about 2500 3000 4 node panels of non uniform sizes adapted to the variation of the hull surface geometry 5 conclusions in the present paper the numerical implementation method of the nm theory by using linear gauss method for panel integral is first established for ship waves then for the numerical problem that the wave component w in the green function g is an oscillatory function with respect to spatial variables x and y another numerical implementation method of the nm theory incorporating with the analytical panel integral related to the elementary wave e is given in the two different numerical methods since the local flow component l in the green function g is not an oscillatory function over space the local flow component in the hogner potential is calculated by the traditional gaussian quadrature the difference between the two numerical methods lies in the numerical implementation strategy of spatial integration for the wave potential where the gaussian quadrature is used in the nm lg and the analytical panel integral is used in the nm lsa the numerical verification results have presented the correctness and efficiency of the analytical panel integral the simulation results of ship waves of the five hulls with specific filter parameters have shown the accuracy of the present two numerical methods the filter parameters associated with filter 1 are suitable for hull forms without bulbs like the wigley hull and series 60 model the filter parameters associated with filter 2 are suitable for hull forms with broad breadths and shallow drafts like the kcs hull and dtmb 5415 model where the hull forms also contain bulbs through the use of the analytical panel integral the time consumption of wave drag computation by the nm lsa is approximately equal to 60 of that by the nm lg which has shown the considerable advantage in time consumption of the nm lsa compared to the nm lg moreover the time consumption of wave drag computation via the nm lsa is less than 2 s during the froude number is greater than 0 2 which is very meaningful for hull form optimization credit authorship contribution statement le zha writing original draft investigation methodology software

attentions from research communities due to their practical potentials in various ocean missions involving coastal and waters monitoring sea observation and military tasks wang et al 2016 among various automation technologies the trajectory tracking control performs a significant role to accomplish these missions specifically the main core of tracking technologies is to drive the vessel to cruise on a time dependent trajectory without human intervention however there still exist many challenges for controller designers to obtain desirable tracking performances such as unmodeled dynamics ocean disturbances and computational resources constraints existing despite of these challenges numerous efforts have been made by researchers for the control issue of marine vehicles leading to fruitful achievements robust control khaled and chalhoub 2011 zhu et al 2020 2021 neural network control zhao et al 2013 van 2019 liu et al 2015 shen et al 2020 fuzzy control kong et al 2018 chen and tan 2013 prescribed performance control xu et al 2018 he et al 2018 huang et al 2021a and adaptive backstepping control hu et al 2020a 2020b 2020c in the issue of marine vessels control the performance would be deteriorated by internal parameter variations and external interferences which are mainly composed of intricate model dynamics and unpredictable ocean disturbances to enhance the control performance in face of uncertain dynamics neural network techniques have been widely adopted to handle unknown dynamics based on its universal approximation properties to this end with the application of radial basis neural networks rbfnns two neural network approximators were constructed to compensate for unknown dynamics in zhao et al 2013 and van 2019 however though the adverse impacts induced by unknown dynamics can be effectively alleviated by these approaches large quantities of computing resources are demanded for the neural nodes weights identification which will not only increase systems computational complexities but also will slow the algorithms running speed fortunately the minimal learning parameter mlp technique is an effective solution to avoid this problem shen et al 2020 lu et al 2020 wu et al 2021 with the utilization of mlp technique numerous neural node weights will be compress into the norm of weights matrix in parameter identification process consequently the on board computational complexity can be reduced in this paper the mlp based approximated technology will be employed for uncertainties estimation though effective only the asymptotic stability is achieved by these forgoing mentioned proposals in the evaluation of control performance the convergence rate can always be a significant index therefore it will be necessary to guarantee all tracking error signals converge within finite time to this end finite time control schemes have been widely developed by researchers in many control fields including for marine vehicles wang et al 2015 qin et al 2020 yao 2020 abooee et al 2020 fu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a huang et al 2021b euler lagrange systems huang et al 2020 and spacecrafts huang et al 2019a 2019b however settling times of finite time control schemes are determined by the values of initial states which means the upper bounds of systems convergence time cannot be specified in prior to overcome this kind of drawback attentions to fixed time control methods are increasing for the system with fixed time convergence rates its settling time is independent of initial states in other words the system could be stabilized in a known time constant regardless of the values of initial states huang et al 2018 on account of this advantage a fixed time extended state observer was developed in zhang et al 2019b to estimate ocean disturbances and vessels states on this basis serval fixed time trajectory tracking control schemes for surface vessels were further developed in zhang et al 2019c 2020a considering the actuator chattering occurred in zhang et al 2020a a new fixed time nonsingular terminal sliding mode phase was proposed in zhang et al 2020b however it should be pointed out that all of these aforementioned fixed time control schemes are focusing on fully actuated vessels rather than underactuated ones owing to this fact these algorithms may cease to be effective for usvs among existing studies only few studies related to fixed time control methods for usvs were reported zhang and guo 2020 zhang and yang 2019 owing to the model underactuation in lateral dynamics the controller synthesis for usvs is much more challenging and complex than fully actuated types in fields of usvs path following control which requires usvs to follow a time independent path line of sight los based methods have been widely explored to solve the obstacles induced by dynamic underactuation liu et al 2015 oh and sun 2010 zheng et al 2017 by implementing los guidance a path parameter updating law and the desired heading angle can be generated through a look ahead distance to help usvs fulfill the path following mission zheng et al 2017 different from the path following control strategies the trajectory tracking control issue that investigated in this paper requires the usv tracking a time varying feasible or non feasible trajectory on time dai et al 2017 in the earlier stage researchers mainly focused on tracking feasible trajectories which are generated by virtual vessels and required to be compiled with the non holonomic constraints of specific vessels by assuming that the reference yaw rate satisfies the persistently exciting pe condition the globally stabilization of tracking feasible trajectories for usvs were achieved jiang 2002 lefeber et al 2003 however under the constraint of pe condition the desired yaw rate was required to be non zero making these results inapplicable for straight line tracking to solve this problem this constraint was relaxed by do et al 2002 making the straight line tracking for usvs become solvable recently by interacting trimming with crossing tracking behavior on the reference trajectory the pe constraint of the reference trajectory can be removed in wang and su 2021 apart from these developments in do 2010 the so called practical control method was proposed for usvs to tracking a non feasible trajectory comparing with feasible trajectories the non feasible type can be arbitrary smooth trajectories that generated by the virtual vessels kinematic equations sun et al 2018 deng et al 2020 fu et al 2019 jia et al 2019 or time parametrized curves dai et al 2017 2018 2019 sun et al 2018 in other words the non feasible trajectory is independent with vessel dynamics and has general forms by virtue of these this practical design method has become the mainstream of the further usvs controller design besides in order to solve the problems induced by model underactuation the model transformations are widely used to achieve a relative degree in model dynamics when design trajectory tracking controllers for usvs such as yaw guidance approaches sun et al 2017 2018 dai et al 2018 deng et al 2019 2020 fu et al 2019 diagonal transformations jia et al 2019 li et al 2020 park and yoo 2016 chen et al 2019 do and pan 2005 and transverse function methods dai et al 2017 2019 do 2010 generally speaking by exploiting these model transformation methods the original usv model will be converted into two subsystems i e surge and yaw channel however owing to this fact the controller devise will be inevitably divided into two channels design which not only increases the design complexity but also complexes the structure of the derived control scheme to be specified the recursive design of virtual speeds which is a crucial step of backstepping design is required by the usvs controller synthesis even in the context of sliding mode controller design sun et al 2017 2018 totally different from this kind of design an integrated control strategy will be proposed in this paper without dividing the controller design into two channels motivated by the above discussions this paper provides a novel fixed time sliding mode controller ftsmc for usvs trajectory tracking missions contributions of this work are summarized as follows i comparing with the finite time control scheme wang et al 2015 qin et al 2020 yao 2020 abooee et al 2020 fu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a the proposed algorithm enjoys the advantage of fixed time convergence rate in other words the settling time of the resulting system is independent with initial states and can be known in prior additionally unknown system dynamics and disturbances are properly dealt with via neural network and adaptive laws ii under the basis of the transformed system a new nonsingular fixed time sliding mode surface is formulated for controller design different from the nonsingular ftsmc scheme in zhang et al 2020b which is only effective for fully actuated surface vessels the presented scheme can achieve the trajectory tracking control objective for usvs in addition comparing with the switching structured ftsmc zhang and guo 2020 the developed one is continuous and enjoys a simpler structure for application the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the usv model and preliminaries are introduced the main results of this paper involving dynamic transformation and controller designing are presented in section 3 numerical verification and comparison results are given in section 4 the conclusion is drawn in section 5 2 usv modeling and preliminaries 2 1 modeling of underactuated surface vessels in this brief we consider that motions of the usv are defined in the horizontal plane two coordinates are defined in fig 1 to describe usv s motion i e the earth fixed coordinate o e x e y e and the body fixed coordinate o b x b y b under these two coordinates the kinematic model of the usv is given as dai et al 2017 1 x u cos ϕ v sin ϕ y u sin ϕ v cos ϕ ϕ r here states x y and ϕ are defined with respect to o e x e y e where x y stand for usvs position and ϕ denotes the yaw angle u v and r respectively stand for the surge velocity sway velocity and yaw velocity related to o b x b y b the dynamic model of the usv is described as follows 2 u m 22 v r h u τ u τ u d m 11 v m 11 u r h v τ v d m 22 r m 11 m 22 u v h r τ r τ r d m 33 where m i i i 1 2 3 are positive constants that stand for ship inertia masses τ u and τ r are control inputs τ u d τ v d and τ r d stand for the time varying unknown external disturbances which are induced by ocean currents winds and waves the nonlinear hydrodynamic damping h i i u v r are expressed as follows 3 h u x u u x u u u u x u u u u 3 h v y v v y v v v v y r v r v h r n r r n v r v r n r r r r here x y and n stand for the linear and quadratic hydrodynamic coefficients in the surge sway and yaw motions respectively remark 1 it should be pointed out that there are only two control inputs τ u and τ r in model dynamics while the control force in the sway channel is not provided therefore the usv described by 1 and 2 is underactuated in trajectory tracking control issues of usvs the difficulty lies in how to eliminate the cross tracking error with uncontrollable sway dynamics comparing to the fully actuated usvs the control problem for underactuated ones will be more challenging remark 2 in engineering applications the usv platform is often designed as underactuated since the installation of the lateral thruster is not only costing but also deteriorates hull hydrodynamic performance in high speed scenarios in general most surface vessels are only equipped with propellers and rudders for surge and yaw motion do and pan 2009 this means the contribution of this work will be meaningful for practice remark 3 the vessels hydrodynamic damping h i i u v r are composed of serval hydrodynamic terms involving potential damping wave drift damping skin friction and so on dai et al 2019 thus it poses many challenges to accurately acquire this kind of information in practice in this paper h i i u v r are supposed to be unknown for controller designers 2 2 notations lemmas and assumptions to facilitate the further model dynamics transformation and controller design some useful lemmas and assumptions should be presented as follows notations for a vector v v 1 v 2 v n t v v 1 2 v 2 2 v n 2 denotes its euclidean norm v v v 1 2 v 2 2 v n 2 t v b v 1 b v 2 b v n b t where b ℝ tanh b v tanh b v 1 tanh b v 2 tanh b v n t for a matrix a det a stands for its determinant assumption 1 for inertia masses in 2 it is assumed that m 11 m 22 always holds assumption 2 for usvs the surge velocity u is supposed to be nonzero and velocities u v r are all defined in compact sets that possess known bounds assumption 3 the external disturbances τ u d τ r d are time varying and continuously differentiable both external disturbances and their time derivative τ u d τ r d are bounded with τ u d d u τ r d d r τ u d d u u τ r d d r r where d u d r d u u and d r r are unknown positive constants assumption 4 the propulsion force τ u is assumed to be derivable i e ξ u τ u remark 4 for marine vessels inertia masses are composed by platform displacement m and added masses δ m i i i 1 2 3 that is m i i m δ m i i the added mass is an inherent hydrodynamic characteristic for objects in fluid environments which is mainly determined by the hull shape and motion direction hence we always have δ m 11 δ m 22 for marine vessels therefore assumption 1 is tenable due to the effects of hydrodynamic damping finite actuator power and continuously changed ocean disturbances assumption 2 and assumption 3 are easily satisfied in marine practice remark 5 in practice the response of thrusters to control signals is always continuous since the power of engine i e internal combustion engine or electric motor is determined by a series of continuously changing mechanical modules therefore assumption 4 is tenable lemma 1 chen et al 2018 considering the system x f x x 0 0 f 0 0 x ℝ n if there exists a lyapunov function v x scalars a b p q ℝ with 0 p 1 q 1 a 0 b 0 and 0 δ such that v x a v p x b v q x δ holds then the trajectory of the closed system is practical fixed time stable pfts moreover the residual set of the system is given by 4 lim t t x v x min δ 1 θ a 1 p δ 1 θ b 1 q where θ ℝ satisfies 0 θ 1 the settling time t is bounded by t 1 a 1 p 1 b q 1 lemma 2 yao 2020 for any χ 0 the following inequality holds 5 x x tanh χ x ε χ ε 0 2785 2 3 radial basis function neural networks in this brief the rbfnn technique will be utilized to approximate the unmodeled dynamics for rbfnns the following lemma holds lemma 3 lu et al 2020 for any given real continuous function f x n ℝ d ℝ it can be approximated by the following rbfnns over a compact set ω x ℝ n to any arbitrary accuracy 6 f x n w m t ξ x n o where w w 1 w 2 l w m t stands for the weight vector m is the neural node number vector x n x 1 x 2 x n t presents the network inputs and the approximation error is denoted as o the vector of gaussian function ξ x n ξ 1 x n ξ 2 x n ξ m x n t is defined as follows 7 ξ i x n exp x n c i 2 2 β i 2 where c i i 1 m is the column vector representing the center distribution of x n β i represents for the width of ξ i x n 3 problem formulation and fixed time control strategy synthesis 3 1 model transformation for underactuated dynamics in this section a novel model transformation approach is developed to fulfill the integrated trajectory tracking controller synthesis to circumvent the obstacles caused by model underactuation in lateral dynamics the usvs tracking error system is firstly extended into a third order one to achieve the relative degree of cross tracking dynamics then an auxiliary vector is defined for the possibility of applying integrated controller design methods the architecture of the transformation process is summarized in fig 2 in this context the reference trajectory is non feasibly generated by parametric functions η d x d y d t g x t g y t t where g i t i x y are smooth functions relative to time and g i t exist for the given time varying reference trajectory η d trajectory tracking errors are defined as 8 x e x x d y e y y d remark 6 similar with the work of dai et al 2017 2018 2019 sun et al 2018 the above defined time parametrized trajectory is non feasible and independent with vessel dynamics in other words it can be defined as any smooth trajectory and more general to be planned in practical application additionally for most kinds of trajectories the existence of g i t is easy to be satisfied for example straight lines κ sin ψ κ cos ψ t circular curves r sin ω t r cos ω t t and spiral curves κ sin ω t t κ cos ω t t t where κ r ω ψ are the planned trajectory parameters t is the time variable taking derivative of 8 and applying 1 lead to the following equation 9 x e u cos ϕ v sin ϕ x d y e u sin ϕ v cos ϕ y d by further calculate the derivative of 9 one has 10 x e y e f 1 g 1 τ u τ r g 1 τ u d τ r d x d y d 11 f 1 f u cos ϕ u r sin ϕ v sin ϕ v r cos ϕ f u sin ϕ u r cos ϕ v cos ϕ v r sin ϕ 12 g 1 cos ϕ m 11 0 sin ϕ m 11 0 where the coupling term f u is defined as f u m 22 v r h u m 11 by observing 12 we can verify that det g 1 0 indicating system 10 is not invertible therefore it is impossible for designers to synthesis the controller directly based on 10 inspiring by ye and zong 2018 and under assumption 3 4 we further differentiate 10 to achieve the relative degree in cross tracking dynamics ye and zong 2018 13 x e y e f 2 g 2 ξ u τ r g 2 τ u d τ r d x d y d where ξ u τ u is the change rate of the propulsion force definitions of f 2 and g 2 are given as follows 14 f 2 a u 2 v r v f r u r 2 cos ϕ a v 2 u r u f r v r 2 sin ϕ a u 2 v r v f r u r 2 sin ϕ a v 2 u r u f r v r 2 cos ϕ g 2 cos ϕ m 11 m 22 m 11 1 v cos ϕ m 11 m 22 1 u sin ϕ m 33 sin ϕ m 11 m 22 m 11 1 v sin ϕ m 11 m 22 1 u cos ϕ m 33 with f r m 11 m 22 u v h r m 33 a u and a v are defined as follows 15 a u m 22 v r m 22 v f r h u m 11 a v m 11 u r m 11 u f r h v m 22 remark 7 the model transformation of 13 is borrowed from the idea in ye and zong 2018 by differentiating x e y e and regarding τ u as an extended state terms u and ϕ will appear in the right hands of 13 which contain τ u and τ r respectively taking τ u as an extended state will make it possible to implement sliding mode control strategy to the tracking control issue of underactuated surface vessel however with the application of this kind of model transformation the derivative of τ u will appear in 13 then for the matrix g 2 we can verify that 16 det g 2 m 11 m 22 u m 11 m 22 m 33 under assumption 1 and 2 we have m 11 m 22 and u 0 therefore we have det g 2 0 therefore we can deduce that g 2 1 exists which indicates that 13 is controllable to proceed we construct the following auxiliary vector 17 e 1 x e k e 1 x e k e 2 tanh x e k e 3 x e α 1 tanh x e α y e k e 1 y e k e 2 tanh y e k e 3 y e α 1 tanh y e α where k e i i 1 2 3 and α are the designed parameters with k e i 0 α 2 remark 8 the main motivation of introducing e 1 is to transform the third order system composed by 8 10 and 13 into a second order one since the terminal sliding mode control methods cannot be directly applied for third order systems besides the fixed time convergence rate of tracking errors x e y e can be ensured by stabilizing e 1 which will be explained by subsequent stability analysis of the resulting control system remark 9 by differentiating 17 we can deduce that terms x e α 2 and y e α 2 will be contained by e 1 obviously if α 2 we will have lim x e 0 x e α 2 and lim x e 0 y e α 2 therefore we should set α 2 to prevent these singularities from happening so as to the setting of β 2 and η 2 in the subsequent controller devise by defining e 1 e 2 the derivative of e 2 can be obtained as 18 with the utilization of 8 10 13 and 17 18 e 2 x f 2 g 2 ξ u τ r g 2 τ u d τ r d h x e h y e x d y d where h ϖ ϖ x e y e is given as follows 19 h ϖ k e 1 ϖ k e 2 1 tanh 2 ϖ ϖ k e 3 α 1 ϖ e α 2 tanh ϖ e α α 1 tanh 2 ϖ e α ϖ e 2 α 2 ϖ based on the relation e 1 x e 2 x 17 and 18 can be rearranged as 20 e 1 x e 2 x e 2 x f g τ d q here τ ξ u τ r t g and f are redefined as g g 2 f f 2 the expression of d and q are given by 21 d g 2 τ u d τ r d q h x e h y e x d y d remark 10 here a second order system is obtained in the above discussion we have analyzed that g 2 1 exists since g g 2 we can conclude that the transformed tracking error system 20 is controllable even when the reference is defined as a non feasible type upon the application of this system smc based integrated design methods become available for usvs remark 11 different from normal control scheme the propulsion force input of 20 is ξ u τ u rather than τ u thus relations ξ u 0 ξ u 0 ξ u 0 will hold for the cases of accelerating sailing and decelerating respectively for convenience of thrust distribution ξ u should be integrated to τ u with ξ u 0 0 instead of the direct utilization of ξ u through this integration operation output signals of the control module in this paper are the propulsion force τ u and yaw moment τ r which are consistent with the most common controllers control objective the control goal of this article is to design a ftsmc for usvs such that the fixed time stability of trajectory tracking errors that defined by 8 will be achieved in the presence of unmodeled dynamics and disturbances 3 2 integrated ftsmc design for usvs in this section the transformed dynamic system 20 is utilized for controller development based on this model a neural network based fixed time trajectory tracking controller is devised for usvs via an integrated design method by which the controller synthesis of surge motion and yaw motion are incorporated into a one channel design the mlp technology is utilized to approximate the unmodeled dynamics with low calculation complexities the entire control strategy is depicted in fig 3 to facilitate the integrated ftsmc synthesis we propose the following sliding mode surface 22 s e 2 k s 1 e 1 k s 2 tanh e 1 k s 3 e 1 β 1 tanh e 1 β where k s i i 1 2 3 and β are the designed parameters with k s i 0 β 2 remark 12 by using 22 the usvs controller design in this brief is integrated into only one channel rather than synthesis them in surge and yaw channels respectively comparing with the existing smc methods for usvs proposed in sun et al 2017 2018 the elaborated one could ensure e 1 converging into a tiny set around zero within a fixed time by employing the tangent hyperbolic function the presented nonsingular fixed time sliding mode manifold could be proposed with a simpler structure than the one presented in zhang et al 2020b zhang and guo 2020 which is based on piecewise functions therefore the presented one 22 will be more feasible for practical implementations to proceed we differentiate 22 along with 20 leading to the following result 23 s e 2 k s 1 e 1 k s 2 i 2 1 tanh 2 e 1 e 1 k s 3 β 1 e 1 β 2 tanh e 1 β e 1 k s 3 β e 1 β 1 i 2 1 tanh 2 e 1 β e 1 β 1 e 1 f g τ d q h e 1 e 2 where i 2 1 1 1 t expression of h e 1 e 2 is given as follows 24 h e 1 e 2 k s 1 e 2 k s 2 i 2 1 tanh 2 e 1 e 2 k s 3 β 1 e 1 β 2 tanh e 1 β e 2 k s 3 β e 1 β 1 i 2 1 tanh 2 e 1 β e 1 β 1 e 2 in order to make our result more applicable for implementation the hull dynamics term f and integrated external disturbance d are all supposed to be unknown according to lemma 3 these unmodeled dynamics can be approximated by the following neural network 25 f d w m 2 t ξ m 2 x o here w m 2 t stands for the network s weight matrix with m 0 being the neural node number ξ m 2 x ξ 1 x ξ 2 x is the gaussian function vector with ξ i x ξ i 1 x ξ i 2 x ξ i m x t i 1 2 and x u v r t o is the approximation error vector it should be noted that the number of adaptive parameter are 2 m in the above constructed neural network 25 from the definition of gaussian function and assumption 2 3 we can deduce that ξ m 2 x and f d are bounded by using lemma 3 the boundedness of w m 2 t and o can also be deduced by using these properties the following mlp technique is adopted to reduce the computational complexity 26 f d w m 2 t ξ m 2 x o μ ψ x r where ψ x and r present the euclidean norms of gaussian function vector ξ m 2 x and approximation error vector o respectively μ w m 2 t is the compressed adaptive gain to guarantee the fixed time stability of s we propose the following control law 27 τ g 1 k τ 1 s k τ 2 tanh s k τ 3 s η 1 tanh s η μ ˆ ψ x tanh μ ˆ ψ x s r ˆ tanh r ˆ s q h e 1 e 2 where k τ i i 1 2 3 and η are the designed parameters with k τ i 0 η 2 r ˆ and μ ˆ are estimators of r and μ respectively the updated laws of r ˆ and μ ˆ are elaborated as follows 28 μ ˆ γ 1 ψ x s γ 3 μ ˆ r ˆ γ 2 s γ 4 r ˆ remark 13 the proposed ftsmc is presented by 17 22 25 28 compared with the existing methods the most attractive advantage of the proposal is that it was designed through an integrated way different from the mlp methods reported in shen et al 2020 lu et al 2020 deng et al 2019 only one mlp adaptive law μ ˆ is necessary in our work rather than two approximators separately designed in surge and yaw channels furthermore fixed time convergence rates of position tracking errors are ensured by the presented algorithm with the application of hyperbolic tangent functions τ is proposed as a smooth function to avoid actuator chattering remark 14 it should be noted that the settling time of the resulting system is the summation of the settling time of s e 1 and x e where y e shares the same convergence time with x e in addition the fixed time convergence rates of the above mentioned signals are governed by k τ 2 k τ 3 η k s 2 k s 3 β and k e 2 k e 3 α respectively where the converge speed of signals can be accelerated by increasing these control gains the relations between the systems settling time and the setting of parameters will be explained by the subsequent stability analysis theorem 1 for the tracking error system 8 and the transformed system 20 under assumptions 1 4 if the control strategy is designed as 17 22 27 28 with parameters k j i 0 i 1 2 3 j e s τ α 2 β 2 η 2 γ k 0 k 1 2 3 4 and initial values μ ˆ 0 0 r ˆ 0 0 ξ u 0 0 then signals s e 1 x e and y e are all pfts proof firstly we prove the boundedness of the sliding mode manifold and estimator signals the following lyapunov candidate is considered 29 v 1 1 2 s t s 1 2 γ 1 μ 2 1 2 γ 2 r 2 where μ μ μ ˆ and r r r stands for the estimation errors of μ and r respectively based on 23 and 27 the time derivative of v 1 can be calculated as the following expression 30 v 1 s t s 1 γ 1 μ μ ˆ 1 γ 2 r r ˆ s t f g τ d q h e 1 e 2 1 γ 1 μ μ ˆ 1 γ 2 r r ˆ s t f d k τ 1 s k τ 2 tanh s k τ 3 s η 1 tanh s η r ˆ tanh r ˆ s μ ˆ ψ x tanh μ ˆ ψ x s 1 γ 1 μ μ ˆ 1 γ 2 r r ˆ by utilizing 26 the following inequality holds 31 s t f d s f d s μ ψ x r then with the combination of 28 30 and 31 it leads to 32 v 1 k τ 1 s t s k τ 2 s t tanh

2 the following inequation holds 33 g s t tanh g s g s 2 ε where ε 0 2785 and g stands for elements of the set 1 r ˆ μ ˆ ψ x since k τ 2 0 k τ 3 0 we can conclude that k τ 2 s t tanh s 0 and k τ 3 s t s η 1 tanh s η 0 by adopting these properties and using 33 one has 34 v 1 k τ 1 s t s s μ ψ x r μ ˆ ψ x s r ˆ s μ ψ x s γ 3 μ ˆ r s γ 4 r ˆ 4 ε k τ 1 s t s μ ψ x s r s μ ψ x s γ 3 μ ˆ r s γ 4 r ˆ 4 ε k τ 1 s t s γ 3 μ μ ˆ γ 4 r r ˆ 4 ε recalling the definitions of μ μ μ ˆ and r r r we can derive that 35 μ μ ˆ μ μ μ 1 2 μ 2 μ 2 2 r r ˆ 1 2 r 2 r 2 2 according to 3 11 and assumption 2 3 it is reasonable to assume that the unmodeled dynamics f d is bounded therefore by adopting lemma 3 we can deduce that μ and r is bounded then substituting 35 into 34 yield 36 v 1 k τ 1 s t s γ 3 2 μ 2 γ 4 2 r 2 γ 3 μ 2 2 γ 4 r 2 2 4 ε k 1 v 1 δ 1 where k 1 min 2 k τ 1 γ 1 γ 3 γ 2 γ 4 and δ 1 4 ε γ 3 μ 2 γ 4 r 2 2 μ and r stand for the upper bounds of μ and r respectively by solving 36 we can obtain that 0 v 1 t δ 1 k 1 v 1 0 δ 1 k 1 e k 1 t which means signals s μ r are uniformly ultimately bounded according to the definition in 7 we can observe that ξ i j x 1 where i 1 2 j 1 2 n thus ψ x is bounded with 2 n therefore there exists a constant ζ 0 that satisfies μ ψ x s r s ζ then we analyze the fixed time stability of s the following lyapunov function is chosen 37 v 2 1 2 s t s differentiating 37 and using 23 we have 38 v 2 s t s s t f g τ d q h e 1 e 2 with the substitution of 26 and 27 it yields 39 v 2 k τ 1 s t s k τ 2 s t tanh s k τ 3 s t s η 1 tanh s η s μ ψ x r μ ˆ ψ x

this completes the proof of theorem 1 remark 15 in this work a robust fixed time trajectory tracking control scheme 17 22 27 28 is provided through the stability analysis we have proved that the settling times of s e 1 x e and y e are all pfts moreover the settling time of the resulting system can be calculated by 60 remark 16 as indicates in 44 52 59 and 60 the control performance of the presented ftsmc can be determined by selecting control parameters generally speaking when error states converge into the sliding mode surface the system can possess a high robustness against perturbations therefore it is preferable to select a large k τ i i 1 2 3 to reduce t s besides it is also recommended to select a large k s i to stabilize the auxiliary system 20 in an early time instant therefore the control performance can be mainly determined by tuning k e i by which the parameter selection in the application of the proposed ftsmc is simplified 4 simulation results in this section some numerical simulation experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness and performance of the proposed algorithm firstly four cases with different perturbations and initial states are carried out to demonstrate the robustness and fixed time convergence of the developed ftsmc then three cases with different design parameters are conducted to verify the control performance of the presented algorithm additionally the comparative experiment with the application of algorithms in dai et al 2017 is also conducted in our second simulation part for illustrating the preferable property of the presented proposal referring to skjetne et al 2005 model parameters of the simulated vessel are given in table 1 remark 17 in order to make experiment results more fit for practical practice actuator saturations are imposed on usvs actuators during experiments these saturation parameters are specified as ξ u max 800 τ u max 600 τ r max 100 the saturation function sat is defined as 61 sat λ λ max λ λ max λ λ max λ λ max λ max λ λ max 4 1 comparison results under different external disturbances and initial states in this subsection the simulation results under different disturbances and initial states are presented external disturbances are produced by 62 τ u d d 1 sin ω d t d 2 τ v d d 1 cos ω d t d 2 τ r d d 1 sin ω d t d 2 where d 1 is the maximum of the time varying part of disturbances while d 2 stands for its constant bias control parameters used in this subsection are given in table 2 and the setup information of scenarios are specified in table 3 the reference time varying trajectory is described in table 4 where t is the time instant ω 0 04 presenting the planned angular velocity of circular trajectories t 1 1 5 π ω and t 2 2 ω being the auxiliary shifting time instants time responses of the trajectory under scenario i iv are depicted in fig 4 from which we can learn that the control objective of trajectory tracking is achieved time responses of the signal x e y e s and e 1 are given in fig 5 by observing figs 4 and 5 we can learn that the proposal in this paper can provide remarkable performance for tracking missions even in the occurrence of large disturbances additionally the fixed time stability of the tracking system is also illustrated by fig 5 from which we can observe that tracking signals x e y e s and e 1 are all stabilized before their estimated settling times which are listed in table 2 respectively from the results in these four scenarios it is found that the whole system maintains high robustness against external disturbances the controller outputs and usv states are given in fig 6 we can learn from these pictures that there is no chattering for actuators during the whole tracking mission additionally the control outputs can adaptively change to guarantee control performance when the desired trajectory shifts from straight lines to curves the estimations of unknown parameters are given in fig 7 which always remain bounded these simulation results prove the validity of theorem 1 4 2 comparison results with different controllers and parameters a comparison experiment is conducted between the proposed ftsmc and the transverse function based adaptive neural network controller tf annc in dai et al 2017 in the previous section the closed loop systems settling time t a l l is bounded by 43 27s which seems not satisfied for some transient performance required missions therefore to illustrate the control performance change of ftsmc by tuning parameters experiments of ftsmc are conducted under three sets of control parameters in this subsection the corresponding parameter configurations are specified in table 5 parameters of tf annc inherit from dai et al 2017 for the sake of brevity the reference trajectory η d x d y d ϕ d t is simplified as follows 63 η d 3 t 0 0 t t t c 3 t c 60 sin t 60 60 cos t t t t t c where t c 30 s t t t c ϕ d is the reference yaw angle which is required by tf annc where i 1 2 3 the unlisted parameters α β η 3 configurations of adaptive laws and mlp network are the same as table 3 initial states are set as x y ϕ t 1 1 0 t u v r t 0 1 0 1 0 1 t external disturbances are given as d 1 d 2 0 1 it should be noted that only necessary data are presented in the following context time responses of position trajectory and tracking errors are depicted in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively from which we can learn that tracking errors under the presented ftsmc are stabilized within their corresponding convergence time comparing with the results of case i iii we can conclude that the transient performance can be considerably enhanced by tuning control parameters additionally comparing with tf annc we can observe that the presented ftsmc possesses better control performance both in the transient response and steady state maintaining in order to show the degree of reduction in computational complexity under the mlp algorithm computational loads of ftsmc and tf annc methods are listed in table 6 in this way we can learn that the computational loads are dramatically reduced under the proposal in this paper the controller outputs and usv velocities are plotted in fig 10 by comparison it comes to the conclusion that the ftsmc method possesses better control accuracy with less energy consumption 5 conclusions this paper provides an integrated solution for the fixed time trajectory tracking controller design issue of usvs suffering from inaccessible system dynamics and disturbances by resorting to a constructive model transformation method controller designs for surge motion and yaw motion are integrated together sliding mode control approach is exploited for the purpose of ensuring fixed time stability finally the numerical simulation results

20424,this paper provides a robust fixed time trajectory tracking controller for underactuated surface vessels usvs suffering from unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances initially a novel model transformation is firstly applied for the possible application of sliding mode control technology then fixed time convergence for tracking errors can be guaranteed by stabilizing the transformed system during the design process a constructive sliding mode surface is structured with the application of hyperbolic tangent function which could ensure the settling time of the designed system independent of initial states to accommodate unknown system dynamics and perturbations the minimum learning parameter based neural network and adaptive updating laws are adopted theoretical analysis shows that tracking errors enjoy practical fixed time stability under the proposed controller numerical simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control scheme keywords underactuated surface vessels trajectory tracking fixed time stability minimum learning parameter 1 introduction in past few decades marine surface vessels have attracted increasing attentions from research communities due to their practical potentials in various ocean missions involving coastal and waters monitoring sea observation and military tasks wang et al 2016 among various automation technologies the trajectory tracking control performs a significant role to accomplish these missions specifically the main core of tracking technologies is to drive the vessel to cruise on a time dependent trajectory without human intervention however there still exist many challenges for controller designers to obtain desirable tracking performances such as unmodeled dynamics ocean disturbances and computational resources constraints existing despite of these challenges numerous efforts have been made by researchers for the control issue of marine vehicles leading to fruitful achievements robust control khaled and chalhoub 2011 zhu et al 2020 2021 neural network control zhao et al 2013 van 2019 liu et al 2015 shen et al 2020 fuzzy control kong et al 2018 chen and tan 2013 prescribed performance control xu et al 2018 he et al 2018 huang et al 2021a and adaptive backstepping control hu et al 2020a 2020b 2020c in the issue of marine vessels control the performance would be deteriorated by internal parameter variations and external interferences which are mainly composed of intricate model dynamics and unpredictable ocean disturbances to enhance the control performance in face of uncertain dynamics neural network techniques have been widely adopted to handle unknown dynamics based on its universal approximation properties to this end with the application of radial basis neural networks rbfnns two neural network approximators were constructed to compensate for unknown dynamics in zhao et al 2013 and van 2019 however though the adverse impacts induced by unknown dynamics can be effectively alleviated by these approaches large quantities of computing resources are demanded for the neural nodes weights identification which will not only increase systems computational complexities but also will slow the algorithms running speed fortunately the minimal learning parameter mlp technique is an effective solution to avoid this problem shen et al 2020 lu et al 2020 wu et al 2021 with the utilization of mlp technique numerous neural node weights will be compress into the norm of weights matrix in parameter identification process consequently the on board computational complexity can be reduced in this paper the mlp based approximated technology will be employed for uncertainties estimation though effective only the asymptotic stability is achieved by these forgoing mentioned proposals in the evaluation of control performance the convergence rate can always be a significant index therefore it will be necessary to guarantee all tracking error signals converge within finite time to this end finite time control schemes have been widely developed by researchers in many control fields including for marine vehicles wang et al 2015 qin et al 2020 yao 2020 abooee et al 2020 fu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a huang et al 2021b euler lagrange systems huang et al 2020 and spacecrafts huang et al 2019a 2019b however settling times of finite time control schemes are determined by the values of initial states which means the upper bounds of systems convergence time cannot be specified in prior to overcome this kind of drawback attentions to fixed time control methods are increasing for the system with fixed time convergence rates its settling time is independent of initial states in other words the system could be stabilized in a known time constant regardless of the values of initial states huang et al 2018 on account of this advantage a fixed time extended state observer was developed in zhang et al 2019b to estimate ocean disturbances and vessels states on this basis serval fixed time trajectory tracking control schemes for surface vessels were further developed in zhang et al 2019c 2020a considering the actuator chattering occurred in zhang et al 2020a a new fixed time nonsingular terminal sliding mode phase was proposed in zhang et al 2020b however it should be pointed out that all of these aforementioned fixed time control schemes are focusing on fully actuated vessels rather than underactuated ones owing to this fact these algorithms may cease to be effective for usvs among existing studies only few studies related to fixed time control methods for usvs were reported zhang and guo 2020 zhang and yang 2019 owing to the model underactuation in lateral dynamics the controller synthesis for usvs is much more challenging and complex than fully actuated types in fields of usvs path following control which requires usvs to follow a time independent path line of sight los based methods have been widely explored to solve the obstacles induced by dynamic underactuation liu et al 2015 oh and sun 2010 zheng et al 2017 by implementing los guidance a path parameter updating law and the desired heading angle can be generated through a look ahead distance to help usvs fulfill the path following mission zheng et al 2017 different from the path following control strategies the trajectory tracking control issue that investigated in this paper requires the usv tracking a time varying feasible or non feasible trajectory on time dai et al 2017 in the earlier stage researchers mainly focused on tracking feasible trajectories which are generated by virtual vessels and required to be compiled with the non holonomic constraints of specific vessels by assuming that the reference yaw rate satisfies the persistently exciting pe condition the globally stabilization of tracking feasible trajectories for usvs were achieved jiang 2002 lefeber et al 2003 however under the constraint of pe condition the desired yaw rate was required to be non zero making these results inapplicable for straight line tracking to solve this problem this constraint was relaxed by do et al 2002 making the straight line tracking for usvs become solvable recently by interacting trimming with crossing tracking behavior on the reference trajectory the pe constraint of the reference trajectory can be removed in wang and su 2021 apart from these developments in do 2010 the so called practical control method was proposed for usvs to tracking a non feasible trajectory comparing with feasible trajectories the non feasible type can be arbitrary smooth trajectories that generated by the virtual vessels kinematic equations sun et al 2018 deng et al 2020 fu et al 2019 jia et al 2019 or time parametrized curves dai et al 2017 2018 2019 sun et al 2018 in other words the non feasible trajectory is independent with vessel dynamics and has general forms by virtue of these this practical design method has become the mainstream of the further usvs controller design besides in order to solve the problems induced by model underactuation the model transformations are widely used to achieve a relative degree in model dynamics when design trajectory tracking controllers for usvs such as yaw guidance approaches sun et al 2017 2018 dai et al 2018 deng et al 2019 2020 fu et al 2019 diagonal transformations jia et al 2019 li et al 2020 park and yoo 2016 chen et al 2019 do and pan 2005 and transverse function methods dai et al 2017 2019 do 2010 generally speaking by exploiting these model transformation methods the original usv model will be converted into two subsystems i e surge and yaw channel however owing to this fact the controller devise will be inevitably divided into two channels design which not only increases the design complexity but also complexes the structure of the derived control scheme to be specified the recursive design of virtual speeds which is a crucial step of backstepping design is required by the usvs controller synthesis even in the context of sliding mode controller design sun et al 2017 2018 totally different from this kind of design an integrated control strategy will be proposed in this paper without dividing the controller design into two channels motivated by the above discussions this paper provides a novel fixed time sliding mode controller ftsmc for usvs trajectory tracking missions contributions of this work are summarized as follows i comparing with the finite time control scheme wang et al 2015 qin et al 2020 yao 2020 abooee et al 2020 fu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a the proposed algorithm enjoys the advantage of fixed time convergence rate in other words the settling time of the resulting system is independent with initial states and can be known in prior additionally unknown system dynamics and disturbances are properly dealt with via neural network and adaptive laws ii under the basis of the transformed system a new nonsingular fixed time sliding mode surface is formulated for controller design different from the nonsingular ftsmc scheme in zhang et al 2020b which is only effective for fully actuated surface vessels the presented scheme can achieve the trajectory tracking control objective for usvs in addition comparing with the switching structured ftsmc zhang and guo 2020 the developed one is continuous and enjoys a simpler structure for application the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the usv model and preliminaries are introduced the main results of this paper involving dynamic transformation and controller designing are presented in section 3 numerical verification and comparison results are given in section 4 the conclusion is drawn in section 5 2 usv modeling and preliminaries 2 1 modeling of underactuated surface vessels in this brief we consider that motions of the usv are defined in the horizontal plane two coordinates are defined in fig 1 to describe usv s motion i e the earth fixed coordinate o e x e y e and the body fixed coordinate o b x b y b under these two coordinates the kinematic model of the usv is given as dai et al 2017 1 x u cos ϕ v sin ϕ y u sin ϕ v cos ϕ ϕ r here states x y and ϕ are defined with respect to o e x e y e where x y stand for usvs position and ϕ denotes the yaw angle u v and r respectively stand for the surge velocity sway velocity and yaw velocity related to o b x b y b the dynamic model of the usv is described as follows 2 u m 22 v r h u τ u τ u d m 11 v m 11 u r h v τ v d m 22 r m 11 m 22 u v h r τ r τ r d m 33 where m i i i 1 2 3 are positive constants that stand for ship inertia masses τ u and τ r are control inputs τ u d τ v d and τ r d stand for the time varying unknown external disturbances which are induced by ocean currents winds and waves the nonlinear hydrodynamic damping h i i u v r are expressed as follows 3 h u x u u x u u u u x u u u u 3 h v y v v y v v v v y r v r v h r n r r n v r v r n r r r r here x y and n stand for the linear and quadratic hydrodynamic coefficients in the surge sway and yaw motions respectively remark 1 it should be pointed out that there are only two control inputs τ u and τ r in model dynamics while the control force in the sway channel is not provided therefore the usv described by 1 and 2 is underactuated in trajectory tracking control issues of usvs the difficulty lies in how to eliminate the cross tracking error with uncontrollable sway dynamics comparing to the fully actuated usvs the control problem for underactuated ones will be more challenging remark 2 in engineering applications the usv platform is often designed as underactuated since the installation of the lateral thruster is not only costing but also deteriorates hull hydrodynamic performance in high speed scenarios in general most surface vessels are only equipped with propellers and rudders for surge and yaw motion do and pan 2009 this means the contribution of this work will be meaningful for practice remark 3 the vessels hydrodynamic damping h i i u v r are composed of serval hydrodynamic terms involving potential damping wave drift damping skin friction and so on dai et al 2019 thus it poses many challenges to accurately acquire this kind of information in practice in this paper h i i u v r are supposed to be unknown for controller designers 2 2 notations lemmas and assumptions to facilitate the further model dynamics transformation and controller design some useful lemmas and assumptions should be presented as follows notations for a vector v v 1 v 2 v n t v v 1 2 v 2 2 v n 2 denotes its euclidean norm v v v 1 2 v 2 2 v n 2 t v b v 1 b v 2 b v n b t where b ℝ tanh b v tanh b v 1 tanh b v 2 tanh b v n t for a matrix a det a stands for its determinant assumption 1 for inertia masses in 2 it is assumed that m 11 m 22 always holds assumption 2 for usvs the surge velocity u is supposed to be nonzero and velocities u v r are all defined in compact sets that possess known bounds assumption 3 the external disturbances τ u d τ r d are time varying and continuously differentiable both external disturbances and their time derivative τ u d τ r d are bounded with τ u d d u τ r d d r τ u d d u u τ r d d r r where d u d r d u u and d r r are unknown positive constants assumption 4 the propulsion force τ u is assumed to be derivable i e ξ u τ u remark 4 for marine vessels inertia masses are composed by platform displacement m and added masses δ m i i i 1 2 3 that is m i i m δ m i i the added mass is an inherent hydrodynamic characteristic for objects in fluid environments which is mainly determined by the hull shape and motion direction hence we always have δ m 11 δ m 22 for marine vessels therefore assumption 1 is tenable due to the effects of hydrodynamic damping finite actuator power and continuously changed ocean disturbances assumption 2 and assumption 3 are easily satisfied in marine practice remark 5 in practice the response of thrusters to control signals is always continuous since the power of engine i e internal combustion engine or electric motor is determined by a series of continuously changing mechanical modules therefore assumption 4 is tenable lemma 1 chen et al 2018 considering the system x f x x 0 0 f 0 0 x ℝ n if there exists a lyapunov function v x scalars a b p q ℝ with 0 p 1 q 1 a 0 b 0 and 0 δ such that v x a v p x b v q x δ holds then the trajectory of the closed system is practical fixed time stable pfts moreover the residual

x n o where w w 1 w 2 l w m t stands for the weight vector m is the neural node number vector x n x 1 x 2 x n t presents the network inputs and the approximation error is denoted as o the vector of gaussian function ξ x n ξ 1 x n ξ 2 x n ξ m x n t is defined as follows 7 ξ i x n exp x n c i 2 2 β i 2 where c i i 1 m is the column vector representing the center distribution of x n β i represents for the width of ξ i x n 3 problem formulation and fixed time control strategy synthesis 3 1 model transformation for underactuated dynamics in this section a novel model transformation approach is developed to fulfill the integrated trajectory tracking controller synthesis to circumvent the obstacles caused by model underactuation in lateral dynamics the usvs tracking error system is firstly extended into a third order one to achieve the relative degree of cross tracking dynamics then an auxiliary vector is defined for the possibility of applying integrated controller design methods the architecture of the transformation process is summarized in fig 2 in this context the reference trajectory is non feasibly generated by parametric functions η d x d y d t g x t g y t t where g i t i x y are smooth functions relative to time and g i t exist for the given time varying reference trajectory η d trajectory tracking errors are defined as 8 x e x x d y e y y d remark 6 similar with the work of dai et al 2017 2018 2019 sun et al 2018 the above defined time parametrized trajectory is non feasible and independent with vessel dynamics in other words it can be defined as any smooth trajectory and more general to be planned in practical application additionally for most kinds of trajectories the existence of g i t is easy to be satisfied for example straight lines κ sin ψ κ cos ψ t circular curves r sin ω t r cos ω t t and spiral curves κ sin ω t t κ cos ω t t t where κ r ω ψ are the planned trajectory parameters t is the time variable taking derivative of 8 and applying 1 lead to the following equation 9 x e u cos ϕ v sin ϕ x d y e u sin ϕ v cos ϕ y d by further calculate the derivative of 9 one has 10 x e y e f 1 g 1 τ u τ r g 1 τ u d τ r d x d y d 11 f 1 f u cos ϕ u r sin ϕ v sin ϕ v r cos ϕ f u sin ϕ u r cos ϕ v cos ϕ v r sin ϕ 12 g 1 cos ϕ m 11 0 sin ϕ m 11 0 where the coupling term f u is defined as f u m 22 v r h u m 11 by observing 12 we can verify that det g 1 0 indicating system 10 is not invertible therefore it is impossible for designers to synthesis the controller directly based on 10 inspiring by ye and zong 2018 and under assumption 3 4 we further differentiate 10 to achieve the relative degree in cross tracking dynamics ye and zong 2018 13 x e y e f 2 g 2 ξ u τ r g 2 τ u d τ r d x d y d where ξ u τ u is the change rate of the propulsion force

11 u f r h v m 22 remark 7 the model transformation of 13 is borrowed from the idea in ye and zong 2018 by differentiating x e y e and regarding τ u as an extended state terms u and ϕ will appear in the right hands of 13 which contain τ u and τ r respectively taking τ u as an extended state will make it possible to implement sliding mode control strategy to the tracking control issue of underactuated surface vessel however with the application of this kind of model transformation the derivative of τ u will appear in 13 then for the matrix g 2 we can verify that 16 det g 2 m 11 m 22 u m 11 m 22 m 33 under assumption 1 and 2 we have m 11 m 22 and u 0 therefore we have det g 2 0 therefore we can deduce that g 2 1 exists which indicates that 13 is controllable to proceed we construct the following auxiliary vector 17 e 1 x e k e 1 x e k e 2 tanh x e k e 3 x e α 1 tanh x e α y e k e 1 y e k e 2 tanh y e k e 3 y e α 1 tanh y e α where k e i i 1 2 3 and α are the designed parameters with k e i 0 α 2 remark 8 the main motivation of introducing e 1 is to transform the third order system composed by 8 10 and 13 into a second order one since the terminal sliding mode control methods cannot be directly applied for third order systems besides the fixed time convergence rate of tracking errors x e y e can be ensured by stabilizing e 1 which will be explained by subsequent stability analysis of the resulting control system remark 9 by differentiating 17 we can deduce that terms x e α 2 and y e α 2 will be contained by e 1 obviously if α 2 we will have lim x e 0 x e α 2 and lim x e 0 y e α 2 therefore we should set α 2 to prevent these singularities from happening so as to the setting of β 2 and η 2 in the subsequent controller devise by defining e 1 e 2 the derivative of e 2 can be obtained as 18 with the utilization of 8 10 13 and 17 18 e 2 x f 2 g 2 ξ u τ r g 2 τ u d τ r d h x e h y e x d y d where h ϖ ϖ x e y e is given as follows 19 h ϖ k e 1 ϖ k e 2 1 tanh 2 ϖ ϖ k e 3 α 1 ϖ e α 2 tanh ϖ e α α 1 tanh 2 ϖ e α ϖ e 2 α 2 ϖ based on the relation e 1 x e 2 x 17 and 18 can be rearranged as 20 e 1 x e 2 x e 2 x f g τ d q here τ ξ u τ r t g and f are redefined as g g 2 f f 2 the expression of d and q are given by 21 d g 2 τ u d τ r d q h x e h y e x d y d remark 10 here a second order system is obtained in the above discussion we have analyzed that g 2 1 exists since g g 2 we can conclude that the transformed tracking error system 20 is controllable even when the reference is defined as a non feasible type upon the application of this system smc based integrated design methods become available for usvs remark 11 different from normal control scheme the propulsion force input of 20 is ξ u τ u rather than τ u thus relations ξ u 0 ξ u 0 ξ u 0 will hold for the cases of accelerating sailing and decelerating respectively for convenience of thrust distribution ξ u should be integrated to τ u with ξ u 0 0 instead of the direct utilization of ξ u through this integration operation output signals of the control module in this paper are the propulsion force τ u and yaw moment τ r which are consistent with the most common controllers control objective the control goal of this article is to design a ftsmc for usvs such that the fixed time stability of trajectory tracking errors that defined by 8 will be achieved in the presence of unmodeled dynamics and disturbances 3 2 integrated ftsmc design for usvs in this section the transformed dynamic system 20 is utilized for controller development based on this model a neural network based fixed time trajectory tracking controller is devised for usvs via an integrated design method by which the controller synthesis of surge motion and yaw motion are incorporated into a one channel design the mlp technology is utilized to approximate the unmodeled dynamics with low calculation complexities the entire control strategy is depicted in fig 3 to facilitate the integrated ftsmc synthesis we propose the following sliding mode surface 22 s e 2 k s 1 e 1 k s 2 tanh e 1 k s 3 e 1 β 1 tanh e 1 β where k s i i 1 2 3 and β are the designed parameters with k s i 0 β 2 remark 12 by using 22 the usvs controller design in this brief is integrated into only one channel rather than synthesis them in surge and yaw channels respectively comparing with the existing smc methods for usvs proposed in sun et al 2017 2018 the elaborated one could ensure e 1 converging into a tiny set around zero within a fixed time by employing the tangent hyperbolic function the presented nonsingular fixed time sliding mode manifold could be proposed with a simpler structure than the one presented in zhang et al 2020b zhang and guo 2020 which is based on piecewise functions therefore the presented one 22 will be more feasible for practical implementations to proceed we differentiate 22 along with 20 leading to the following result 23 s e 2 k s 1 e 1 k s 2 i 2 1 tanh 2 e 1 e 1 k s 3 β 1 e 1 β 2 tanh e 1 β e 1 k s 3 β e 1 β 1 i 2 1 tanh 2 e 1 β e 1 β 1 e 1 f g τ d q h e 1 e 2 where i 2 1 1 1 t expression of h e 1 e 2 is given as follows 24 h e 1 e 2 k s 1 e 2 k s 2 i 2 1 tanh 2 e 1 e 2 k s 3 β 1 e 1 β 2 tanh e 1 β e 2 k s 3 β e 1 β 1 i 2 1 tanh 2 e 1 β e 1 β 1 e 2 in order to make our result more applicable for implementation the hull dynamics term f and integrated external disturbance d are all supposed to be unknown according to lemma 3 these unmodeled dynamics can be approximated by the following neural network 25 f d w m 2 t ξ m 2 x o here w m 2 t stands for the network s weight matrix with m 0 being the neural node number ξ m 2 x ξ 1 x ξ 2 x is the gaussian function vector with ξ i x ξ i 1 x ξ i 2 x ξ i m x t i 1 2 and x u v r t o is the approximation error vector it should be noted that the number of adaptive parameter are 2 m in the above constructed neural network 25 from the definition of gaussian function and assumption 2 3 we can deduce that ξ m 2 x and f d are bounded by using lemma 3 the boundedness of w m 2 t and o can also be deduced by using these properties the following mlp technique is adopted to reduce the computational complexity 26 f d w m 2 t ξ m 2 x o μ ψ x r where ψ x and r present the euclidean norms of gaussian function vector ξ m 2 x and approximation error vector o respectively μ w m 2 t is the compressed adaptive gain to guarantee the fixed time stability of s we propose the following control law 27 τ g 1 k τ 1 s k τ 2 tanh s k τ 3 s η 1 tanh s η μ ˆ ψ x tanh μ ˆ ψ x s r ˆ tanh r ˆ s q h e 1 e 2 where k τ i i 1 2 3 and η are the designed parameters with k τ i 0 η 2 r ˆ and μ ˆ are estimators of r and μ respectively the updated laws of r ˆ and μ ˆ are elaborated as follows 28 μ ˆ γ 1 ψ x s γ 3 μ ˆ r ˆ γ 2 s γ 4 r ˆ remark 13 the proposed ftsmc is presented by 17 22 25 28 compared with the existing methods the most attractive advantage of the proposal is that it was designed through an integrated way different from the mlp methods reported in shen et al 2020 lu et al 2020 deng et al 2019 only one mlp adaptive law μ ˆ is necessary in our work rather than two approximators separately designed in surge and yaw channels furthermore fixed time convergence rates of position tracking errors are ensured by the presented algorithm with the application of hyperbolic tangent functions τ is proposed as a smooth function to avoid actuator chattering remark 14 it should be noted that the settling time of the resulting system is the summation of the settling time of s e 1 and x e where y e shares the same convergence time with x e in addition the fixed time convergence rates of the above mentioned signals are governed by k τ 2 k τ 3 η k s 2 k s 3 β and k e 2 k e 3 α respectively where the converge speed of signals can be accelerated by increasing these control gains the relations between the systems settling time and the setting of parameters will be explained by the subsequent stability analysis theorem 1 for the tracking error system 8 and the transformed system 20 under assumptions 1 4 if the control strategy is designed as 17 22 27 28 with parameters k j i 0 i 1 2 3 j e s τ α 2 β 2 η 2 γ k 0 k 1 2 3 4 and initial values μ ˆ 0 0 r ˆ 0 0 ξ u 0 0 then signals s e 1 x e and y e are all pfts proof firstly we prove the boundedness of the sliding mode manifold and estimator signals the following lyapunov candidate is considered 29 v 1 1 2 s t s 1 2 γ 1 μ 2 1 2 γ 2 r 2 where μ μ μ ˆ and r r r stands for the estimation errors of μ and r respectively based on 23 and 27 the time derivative of v 1 can be calculated as the following expression 30 v 1 s t s 1 γ 1 μ μ ˆ 1 γ 2 r r ˆ s t f g τ d q h e 1 e 2 1 γ 1 μ μ ˆ 1 γ 2 r r ˆ s t f d k τ 1 s k τ 2 tanh s k τ 3 s η 1 tanh s η r ˆ tanh r ˆ s μ ˆ ψ x tanh μ ˆ ψ x s 1 γ 1 μ μ ˆ 1 γ 2 r r ˆ by utilizing 26 the following inequality holds 31 s t f d s f d s μ ψ x r then with the combination of 28 30 and 31 it leads to 32 v 1 k τ 1 s t s k τ 2 s t tanh

laws in 28 we have μ ˆ γ 1 γ 3 μ ˆ consequently for any initial value μ ˆ 0 0 we can calculate that μ ˆ e γ 1 γ 3 t μ ˆ 0 0 similarly we also have r ˆ 0 under the premise of r ˆ 0 0 by applying lemma 2 the following inequation holds 33 g s t tanh g s g s 2 ε where ε 0 2785 and g stands for elements of the set 1 r ˆ μ ˆ ψ x since k τ 2 0 k τ 3 0 we can conclude that k τ 2 s t tanh s 0 and k τ 3 s t s η 1 tanh s η 0 by adopting these properties and using 33 one has 34 v 1 k τ 1 s t s s μ ψ x r μ ˆ ψ x s r ˆ s μ ψ x s γ 3 μ ˆ r s γ 4 r ˆ 4 ε k τ 1 s t s μ ψ x s r s μ ψ x s γ 3 μ ˆ r s γ 4 r ˆ 4 ε k τ 1 s t s γ 3 μ μ ˆ γ 4 r r ˆ 4 ε recalling the definitions of μ μ μ ˆ and r r r we can derive that 35 μ μ ˆ μ μ μ 1 2 μ 2 μ 2 2 r r ˆ 1 2 r 2 r 2 2 according to 3 11 and assumption 2 3 it is reasonable to assume that the unmodeled dynamics f d is bounded therefore by adopting lemma 3 we can deduce that μ and r is bounded then substituting 35 into 34 yield 36 v 1 k τ 1 s t s γ 3 2 μ 2 γ 4 2 r 2 γ 3 μ 2 2 γ 4 r 2 2 4 ε k 1 v 1 δ 1 where k 1 min 2 k τ 1 γ 1 γ 3 γ 2 γ 4 and δ 1 4 ε γ 3 μ 2 γ 4 r 2 2 μ and r stand for the upper bounds of μ and r respectively by solving 36 we can obtain that 0 v 1 t δ 1 k 1 v 1 0 δ 1 k 1 e k 1 t which means signals s μ r are uniformly ultimately bounded according to the definition in 7 we can observe that ξ i j x 1 where i 1 2 j 1 2 n thus ψ x is bounded with 2 n therefore there exists a constant ζ 0 that satisfies μ ψ x s r s ζ then we analyze the fixed time stability of s the following lyapunov function is chosen 37 v 2 1 2 s t s differentiating 37 and using 23 we have 38 v 2 s t s s t f g τ d q h e 1 e 2 with the substitution of 26 and 27 it yields 39 v 2 k τ 1 s t s k τ 2 s t tanh s k τ 3 s t s η 1 tanh s η s μ ψ x r μ ˆ ψ x s r ˆ s 4 ε k τ 1 s t s k τ 2 s t tanh s k τ 3 s t s η 1 tanh s η μ ψ x s r s 4 ε by incorporating lemma 2 the following inequalities hold 40 k τ 2 s t tanh s k τ 2 s 2 k τ 2 ε 41 k τ 3 s t s η 1 tanh s η k τ 3 s η t tanh s η k τ 3 s η 2 k τ 3 ε substituting 40 41 into 39 and incorporating property μ ψ x s r s ζ it yields 42 v 2 k τ 1 s t s k τ 2 s k τ 3 s η δ 2 2 k τ 1 v 2 2 k τ 2 v 2 1 2 2 η 2 k τ 3 v 2 η 2 δ 2 2 k τ 2 v 2 1 2 2 η 2 k τ 3 v 2 η 2 δ 2 where δ 2 2 k τ 2 2 k τ 2 4 ε ζ according to lemma 1 and 42 we can conclude that signal s is pfts the residual set is determined by 43 δ s lim t t s s v 2 min δ 2 1 θ 2 k τ 2 2 δ 2 1 θ 2 η 2 k τ 3 2 η and the upper bound of the settling time t s is given by 44 t s 2 k τ 2 2 2 η 2 k τ 3 η 2 then we analyze the fixed time stability of e 1 when s is converging into the region δ s the sliding mode manifold defined in 22 becomes 45 θ e 2 k s 1 e 1 k s 2 tanh e 1 k s 3 e 1 β 1 tanh e 1 β where θ θ 1 θ 2 t is a bounded time varying vector satisfying θ δ s notice that e 1 e 2 45 can be rearranged as 46 e 1 k s 1 e 1 k s 2 tanh e 1 k s 3 e 1 β 1 tanh e 1 β θ considering the following lyapunov candidate 47 v 3 1 2 e 1 t e 1 in light of 46 the time derivative of v 3 can be derived as 48 v 3 k s 1 e 1 t e 1 k s 2 e 1 t tanh e 1 k s 3 e 1 t e 1 β 1 tanh e 1 β e 1 t θ by applying lemma 2 we have k s 2 e 1 t tanh e 1 k s 2 e 1 2 k s 2 ε and k s 3 e 1 t e 1 β 1 tanh e 1 β k s 3 e 1 β 2 k s 3 ε therefore 48 can be developed as 49 v 3 k s 1 e 1 t e 1 k s 2 e 1 k s 3 e 1 β θ 2 χ 1 χ 1 e 1 t e 1 2 k s 2 ε 2 k s 3 ε k s 1 χ 1 e 1 t e 1 k s 2 e

satisfied then it leads to 50 v 3 2 k s 2 v 3 1 2 2 β 2 k s 3 v 3 β 2 δ 3 according to lemma 1 we can deduce that e 1 is pfts and the residual set of e 1 is given by 51 δ e 1 lim t t e 1 e 1 v 3 min δ 3 1 θ 2 k s 2 2 δ 3 1 θ 2 β 2 k s 3 2 β moreover the settling time of e 1 is bounded by t e 1 t s t e 1 where 52 t e 1 2 k s 2 1 2 β 2 1 k s 3 β 2 then when e 1 is converging into the region δ e 1 there will exists vector λ λ 1 λ 2 t satisfying λ δ e 1 such that 53 holds 53 x e k e 1 x e k e 2 tanh x e k e 3 x e α 1 tanh x e α λ 1 y e k e 1 y e k e 2 tanh y e k e 3 y e α 1 tanh y e α λ 2 which can be rewritten as 54 x e k e 1 x e k e 2 tanh x e k e 3 x e α 1 tanh x e α λ 1 y e k e 1 y e k e 2 tanh y e k e 3 y e α 1 tanh y e α λ 2 then in order to prove the fixed time stability of x e and y

any positive scalar that satisfies λ 1 x e λ 2 y e χ 2 x e 2 y e 2 λ 1 2 λ 2 2 2 χ 2 since k e 1 χ 2 0 can always be satisfied 56 can be developed as 57 v 4 k e 2 x e tanh x e k e 3 x e α tanh x e α k

this completes the proof of theorem 1 remark 15 in this work a robust fixed time trajectory tracking control scheme 17 22 27 28 is provided through the stability analysis we have proved that the settling times of s e 1 x e and y e are all pfts moreover the settling time of the resulting system can be calculated by 60 remark 16 as indicates in 44 52 59 and 60 the control performance of the presented ftsmc can be determined by selecting control parameters generally speaking when error states converge into the sliding mode surface the system can possess a high robustness against perturbations therefore it is preferable to select a large k τ i i 1 2 3 to reduce t s besides it is also recommended to select a large k s i to stabilize the auxiliary system 20 in an early time instant therefore the control performance can be mainly determined by tuning k e i by which the parameter selection in the application of the proposed ftsmc is simplified 4 simulation results in this section some numerical simulation experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness and performance of the proposed algorithm firstly four cases with different perturbations and initial states are carried out to demonstrate the robustness and fixed time convergence of the developed ftsmc then three cases with different design parameters are conducted to verify the control performance of the presented algorithm additionally the comparative experiment with the application of algorithms in dai et al 2017 is also conducted in our second simulation part for illustrating the preferable property of the presented proposal referring to skjetne et al 2005 model parameters of the simulated vessel are given in table 1 remark 17 in order to make experiment results more fit for practical practice actuator saturations are imposed on usvs actuators during experiments these saturation parameters are specified as ξ u max 800 τ u max 600 τ r max 100 the saturation function sat is defined as 61 sat λ λ max λ λ max λ λ max λ λ max λ max λ λ max 4 1 comparison results under different external disturbances and initial states in this subsection the simulation results under different disturbances and initial states are presented external disturbances are produced by 62 τ u d d 1 sin ω d t d 2 τ v d d 1 cos ω d t d 2 τ r d d 1 sin ω d t d 2 where d 1 is the maximum of the time varying part of disturbances while d 2 stands for its constant bias control parameters used in this subsection are given in table 2 and the setup information of scenarios are specified in table 3 the reference time varying trajectory is described in table 4 where t is the time instant ω 0 04 presenting the planned angular velocity of circular trajectories t 1 1 5 π ω and t 2 2 ω being the auxiliary shifting time instants time responses of the trajectory under scenario i iv are depicted in fig 4 from which we can learn that the control objective of trajectory tracking is achieved time responses of the signal x e y e s and e 1 are given in fig 5 by observing figs 4 and 5 we can learn that the proposal in this paper can provide remarkable performance for tracking missions even in the occurrence of large disturbances additionally the fixed time stability of the tracking system is also illustrated by fig 5 from which we can observe that tracking signals x e y e s and e 1 are all stabilized before their estimated settling times which are listed in table 2 respectively from the results in these four scenarios it is found that the whole system maintains high robustness against external disturbances the controller outputs and usv states are given in fig 6 we can learn from these pictures that there is no chattering for actuators during the whole tracking mission additionally the control outputs can adaptively change to guarantee control performance when the desired trajectory shifts from straight lines to curves the estimations of unknown parameters are given in fig 7 which always remain bounded these simulation results prove the validity of theorem 1 4 2 comparison results with different controllers and parameters a comparison experiment is conducted between the proposed ftsmc and the transverse function based adaptive neural network controller tf annc in dai et al 2017 in the previous section the closed loop systems settling time t a l l is bounded by 43 27s which seems not satisfied for some transient performance required missions therefore to illustrate the control performance change of ftsmc by tuning parameters experiments of ftsmc are conducted under three sets of control parameters in this subsection the corresponding parameter configurations are specified in table 5 parameters of tf annc inherit from dai et al 2017 for the sake of brevity the reference trajectory η d x d y d ϕ d t is simplified as follows 63 η d 3 t 0 0 t t t c 3 t c 60 sin t 60 60 cos t t t t t c where t c 30 s t t t c ϕ d is the reference yaw angle which is required by tf annc where i 1 2 3 the unlisted parameters α β η 3 configurations of adaptive laws and mlp network are the same as table 3 initial states are set as x y ϕ t 1 1 0 t u v r t 0 1 0 1 0 1 t external disturbances are given as d 1 d 2 0 1 it should be noted that only necessary data are presented in the following context time responses of position trajectory and tracking errors are depicted in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively from which we can learn that tracking errors under the presented ftsmc are stabilized within their corresponding convergence time comparing with the results of case i iii we can conclude that the transient performance can be considerably enhanced by tuning control parameters additionally comparing with tf annc we can observe that the presented ftsmc possesses better control performance both in the transient response and steady state maintaining in order to show the degree of reduction in computational complexity under the mlp algorithm computational loads of ftsmc and tf annc methods are listed in table 6 in this way we can learn that the computational loads are dramatically reduced under the proposal in this paper the controller outputs and usv velocities are plotted in fig 10 by comparison it comes to the conclusion that the ftsmc method possesses better control accuracy with less energy consumption 5 conclusions this paper provides an integrated solution for the fixed time trajectory tracking controller design issue of usvs suffering from inaccessible system dynamics and disturbances by resorting to a constructive model transformation method controller designs for surge motion and yaw motion are integrated together sliding mode control approach is exploited for the purpose of ensuring fixed time stability finally the numerical simulation results imply that the proposed controller not only possesses fixed time convergence rate and remarkable tracking accuracy but also shows satisfactory disturbance rejection capability credit authorship
