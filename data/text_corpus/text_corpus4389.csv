21945,semi active control is one of the most effective methods for damage reduction in offshore platforms subjected to intense environmental forces despite its advantages probable device time delays may drastically decrease the real performance of the control algorithm thus the uncertainty could make the control process non optimal in this paper a kalman filter is used to ponder previous responses and the history of the measured errors in order to estimate the real state variables of an offshore structure equipped with magneto rheological mr dampers in the current article the amount of applied voltage to the mr damper is optimized via the adaptive particle swarm optimization apso method furthermore the structure is controlled by the linear quadratic regulator lqr algorithm a newly installed offshore platform located in the persian gulf at a depth of 64 m is considered as an example to demonstrate the performance of the controller the offshore structure is assumed to be excited by near and far field earthquakes the results of the parametric studies indicate that all the earthquake induced vibrations of the platform can be effectively suppressed by the designed control system moreover the life spans of the dampers may increase with the predicting optimizing algorithm graphical abstract a predictor optimizing semi active control system is designed to reduce structural responses of a fixed metal offshore platform equipped by horizontal mr dampers under earthquake excitations the controller estimates the responses of the structure considering probable noises to reduce the time delays and inefficient actuator forces in addition the inlet voltages of the dampers are optimized to develop the dampers duration and reduce the structural responses image 1 keywords semi active control control of offshore platforms mr damper adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm kalman filter 1 introduction offshore structures play a significant role in the extraction of fossil fuels safety and resilience of such structures is a critical issue in oil production and the economy of a country offshore platforms are regularly subjected to environmental loadings such as waves sea storms severe winds ship collisions and earthquakes to reduce the structural response of offshore structures and on the other hand to increase its safety several control strategies have been investigated in the previous studies which could be divided into four groups of passive active semi active and hybrid controlling systems semi active control systems are capable of generating significant forces using a small amount of input energy besides in the absence of external energy they could be supposed as a passive control device because of the practical limitation of other damping devices semi active control systems are more convenient moreover mr damper is an effective semi active control device which could be utilized to diminish the response of offshore platforms li et al studied a single degree of freedom sdof platform equipped with mr dampers and demonstrated a remarkable reduction not only in the maximum responses but in the corresponding root mean square rms values however they did not describe how to implement the control system li and wang 2002 wan et al worked on a fuzzy logic semi active control system they used a fuzzy controller to obtain optimal control force by considering the error of the displacement response of the offshore platforms and errors of the input variables wan et al 2007 optimization is a systematic process which makes the most usage of a system with the least losses based on the set of certain constraints and criteria the most important objective in the optimization of a controlled structure would be to design a high level of safety and an accurate control system with the lowest cost the optimization algorithms can be categorized into at least two types of classical and meta heuristic for simple continuous and linear problems classical algorithms are commonly used however for more complex problems meta heuristics algorithms such as genetic algorithm ga ant colony algorithm aca and particle swarm optimization pso algorithm are better alternatives because of their stability and flexibility wang et al 2018 pso is a prevalent optimization method which was introduced by kennedy and eberhart in 1995 this method is based on the social behavior of animals pso is an appropriate method for solving discrete nonlinear and non integrative problems rashed et al 2007 pso quietly similar to the ga are two evolutionary search methods which change from a set of points to another set of points within an iteration with visible improvement from the previous values using some probabilistic and deterministic rules despite the high capabilities of the ga in solving complex problems high implementation cost and usually requirement of a higher number of iterations are its drawbacks shabir and singla professor 2016 it worth noting that time is a noticeable parameter for controlling a structure during an earthquake excitation hence when the number of iterations in an optimization algorithm is declined the controlled system performance is enriched as a result pso could be an optimization algorithm with lower complexity and a number of iterations besides the results of a set of researches displayed that pso outperforms the ga in computational efficiency hassan et al 2004 in addition pso has a high convergence rate in which particles may be trapped in a local minimum consequently the original pso algorithm needs to be improved in such a way that it prevents particles from being trapped therefore some evolutionary models have been suggested to overcome this obstacle chuang et al 2011 2012 chuanwen and bompard 2005 liu and han 2005 adaptive particle swarm optimization apso algorithm resolves the issue and simultaneously increases the accuracy of the solution ide and yasuda proposed adaptive pso and demonstrated its effectiveness and feasibility of simulations ide and yasuda 2005 zhan et al extended pso to apso using a new approach and substantially improved the performance of the pso algorithm in terms of convergence speed global optimality solution accuracy and algorithm reliability zhan et al 2009 optimal control of a structure is a time consuming process all computational efforts in the numerical solutions of the governing equations and meta heuristic optimization need time to be completed as well all efforts are repeated for each time interval during the external excitation additionally the received data by the sensors are not exact according to the above mentioned facts it may not be possible to claim that the structures have been optimally controlled chuang et al 2011 in most of the researches in civil engineering the delays have been neglected or not properly defined for instance césar et al did not assume any time delays for their studied semi active control system césar et al 2019 and bathaei et al did not mention the amount of uncertainty they took for the semi active control of their survey bathaei et al 2018 while a typical example of the time delay has been demonstrated by gharebaghi and zangooei 2017 they have proposed a chaotic map to improve the original pso algorithm and studied the time delay in the numerical computations in optimal control of shear buildings to fully measure the state of a system the errors caused by the system s time delays should be deliberated the present paper is an attempt to apply the hinted delays in the control algorithm more precisely this article deals with time delays and noises the paper uses a kalman filter to predict the state variables of the system at each moment when the control force is applied subsequently in the process of computing the best control force the delays noises and predicted state variables are examined simultaneously finally the result of the method would be closer to real world experiments where computers and control devices need time to compute the best forces and react kalman filter as an optimal state estimator can lessen the errors of both the calculation process and the measured values by the control devices to the optimum level based on the time delay between sending orders and receiving the responses therefore it provides an updated model of a real time controlled system by prediction of structural responses simon 2006 kalman filter has been used in various research fields for example in 2011 bin et al studied a real time hybrid test rht model of a platform equipped with semi active mr dampers and base isolators in the gulf of china they predicted the platform response by implementing the acceleration on the deck more accurately for ice excitations albeit they ignored time delay of mr dampers and sensors and considered constant noises for kalman filter wu et al 2011 papadimitriou et al predicted the fatigue life of low sensitivity steel structures using a kalman filter papadimitriou et al 2011 in another work the lifetime of an offshore platform under structural loads had been investigated via kalman filtering periši ć et al 2014 ren et al measured the life of a platform by monitoring the fatigue of truss members and estimating the strain response of the platform ren and zhou 2014 in addition ren et al implemented the augmented kalman filter to monitor the health of truss structures and measure structural responses accurately ren and zhou 2017 in this study a simplified model of a newly installed jacket type offshore platform in the persian gulf studied by asgarian et al 2004 has been supplied with semi active mr dampers in order to reduce the responses of the structures under strong ground motions the mr dampers embedded horizontally between the deck and the jacket of the platform are compliant with the bouc wen model the optimum voltage of the damper is computed using the apso algorithm and the optimization controlled system is designed by the lqr technique the simulations have been performed using two far field and three near field earthquakes in two levels of strength and ductility the kalman filter has been applied to predict the response of the platform and decrease the errors of the optimization controlled system it is notable that a full real time hybrid test is required when using the kalman filter however because of the lack of accessing real measurements the current study assumes a linear kalman filter with a normal distribution of noises for long stroke mr dampers and low noisy sensors the mentioned assumptions are made in such a way that they are in agreement with their real counterparts matisko and havlena 2010 wu et al 2011 yuen et al 2013 in fact the implemented software is capable of simulating a full virtual laboratory to investigate the performance of the control algorithm compared to previous studies all possible errors had been considered in this paper which increases the accuracy of practical results 2 optimization of semi active control system the objective of structural control is to improve the performance of a structure subjected to external forces via response and absorbed energy reduction however there are some conditions that should be held in the minimization of the response and the absorbed energy 2 1 optimization particle swarm optimization is a meta heuristic algorithm based on the collective behavior of birds and fish when searching for food in this algorithm each agent or particle has a location and velocity in the search space in the first step of the algorithm a predefined number of agents particles are randomly distributed throughout the search space next the objective function is evaluated for each agent for the first iteration each particle saves its evaluation value noted by p b e s t during the next iterations the current evaluation of each particle is compared with the previous best value of that particle and its p b e s t is updated if required in each step there is a global best value which is the best of p b e s t values it is denoted by g b e s t and the corresponding particle is identified as the best particle in the current iteration the best particle is assumed to be the solution to the optimization problem at the end of the current iteration thus all of the other agents move toward the best particle in fact the location of each agent is updated by its velocity the velocity of each particle is computed exerting its individual memory its location and p b e s t and the experience of the group g b e s t as presented in eqn 1 at the end of the current iteration the location of each particle is updated using eqn 2 talukder 2011 1 v i j k 1 w v i j k c 1 r 1 j k p b e s t i k x i j k c 2 r 2 j k g b e s t x i j k i 1 2 n 2 x i j k 1 x i j k v i j k 1 where i j n k are particle number particle dimension number number of total particle and stages of update respectively the inertia weight w first introduced by shi and eberhart in 1999 shi et al 1999 balances the global and local search capabilities c 1 and c 2 are acceleration coefficients and r 1 and r 2 are two independent randomly generated numbers within 0 1 the advantages of the pso algorithm include memory capacity high convergence speed easy implementation and fewer parameters in such an algorithm all particles collaborate and share their experience and memory to find the best solution the method is simply implemented has few parameters and a high convergence speed an evolutionary state estimation ese approach has been developed to control the pso algorithm more objectively and optimally zhan et al 2009 the ese approach not only considers agents information but espies the behavior of the agents and their distribution in each generation to this end the mean distance of each particle from all the other particles is calculated with eqn 3 then an evolutionary factor is calculated using eqn 4 to classify the fuzzy membership functions into one of the four evolutionary states exploration s 1 exploitation s 2 convergence s 3 and jumping out s 4 the membership functions are presented in fig 1 zhan et al 2009 3 d i 1 n 1 j 1 j i n k 1 d x i k x j k 2 4 f d g d m i n d m a x d m i n 0 1 where i indicates the computed distance for i t h agent additionally n is the population size and d is the number of dimensions besides d g d m a x and d m i n are the globally best particle the maximum and minimum distance of d i respectively in this paper the inertia weight w is monotonic with the evolutionary factor f and would be adapted to the search environment characterized by f which is given in eqn 5 it has been shown that the inertia weigh prevents particles from being trapped in local minima zhan et al 2009 5 w 1 1 1 5 e 2 6 f 0 4 0 9 f 0 1 the acceleration coefficients c 1 and c 2 in companion with inertia weight prevent particle clustering in local minima the parameter c 1 maintains the diversity of the swarm while c 2 makes the swarm converge to the current globally best region in this research these coefficients are initialized to 2 0 and adaptively controlled according to the introduced strategies in evolutionary state according to the strategies shown in table 1 in order to avoid the irruption of the acceleration coefficients the maximum increase and decrease between the two generations is bounded by eqn 6 6 c i g 1 c i g δ i 1 2 where g is the generation index representing the current number of evolutionary generations and δ is auniformly generated random variable in the range of 0 05 0 1 it is important to note that for exploitation and convergence the amount of δ is divided by 2 subsequently if the summation amount of c 1 and c 2 is greater than four both coefficients should be normalized as eqn 7 7 c i c i c 1 c 2 4 0 i 1 2 when a structure is excited it absorbs energy at least in the form of kinetic energy which is related to the velocity and potential energy due to structural deformation to control structural response one may apply a huge amount of control force which needs a considerable amount of external energy for practical purposes there is a limit of external energy thus in optimal control it is desired to reduce the amount of external energy and structural response as well such energies could be expressed by a performance index j which will be presented later in eqn 16 the index contains not only the structural absorbed energy but also the amount of damper force the optimization algorithm which was presented in this section could be utilized in optimal semi active control of structures where the best control force is computed to minimize j in each time step 2 2 mr damper and bouc wen model magneto rheological damper is one of the most promising devices for structural vibration reduction because of the advantages of large force capacity against less external power this device is built up by a hydraulic cylinder that contains mr fluid mr fluids usually consist of 20 40 suspended micron sized about 3 5 μm in diameter pure iron carbonyls dispersed in a carrier medium such as mineral or silicone oil mr fluids can change their mechanical properties linear viscose liquid to semi solid with the aid of magnetic flux electric current within a few milliseconds bahar and chaibakhsh 2011 as a result the variation of the inlet voltage which could create a large damping force is a significant parameter to control the structural responses moreover mr fluids can operate at temperatures from 40 to 150 c with only slight variations in the yield stress spencer et al 1997 the flux dependent shear strength of mr fluid depends on several factors including the size composition volume fraction of the particles and also the strength of the applied magnetic field khan et al 2014 fig 2 is a schematic view of the details of an mr damper in structures especially with non elastic characters which exhibit hysteresis behavior under dynamic pressure the restoring force depends on the moment of the displacement and the past events of the structure for this reason the proper modeling of the system is an important issue sapiński et al 2003 bouc wen model as one of the earliest models has been used extensively in describing the hysteretic behavior of mr dampers every functional step of voltage optimization process and command signal transition from a digital controller to an actuator consumes time any disregard for these time delays results in a non optimal control system which causes more structural damages by inserting inaccurate control forces in the wrong times sensors actuators and a digital control room are the main parts of a controlling system in real time control of a system the external excitations and structural responses can be measured by the sensors placed on different parts of the structure however despite the noise of the sensors due to operational limitations it is not possible to distribute enough sensors all over the structure noticing the probable faults in electrical devices the kalman filtering algorithm estimates the state of a system and aids in the production of precise control force while considering the mechanical errors and the time spent on the optimization algorithm process numerical model of an optimized semi active control algorithm modified with kalman filter is presented in the next section 3 numerical modeling in this section two numerical simulations are performed while the first simulation assumes no delay in the control process the second simulation utilizes a kalman filter to represent a more realistic model both models apply the apso algorithm to determine the optimum voltage of mr dampers to control an offshore structure under earthquake loading 3 1 optimum control in the absence of the kalman filter the governing equation of the structure is presented in eqn 8 where x x and x are displacement velocity and acceleration vectors respectively additionally m c k f d l and x g are mass damping stiffness damper force a vector filled by 1 and ground acceleration correspondingly and matrix d is used to apply the damper force on the stories where the damper is located the governing equation demonstrates how the behavior of the damper is coupled with the structural response 8 m x c x k x d f d m l x g according to the bouc wen model the damper force f d evolutionary variable z and the relative velocity along two sides of mr damper v are obtained from eqns 9 12 şahin et al 2010 9 f d j c 0 a j c 0 b j u j v j k 0 x x 0 α a j α b j u j z j j 1 m 10 z j γ j v j z j z j n 1 β j v j z j n a j v j 11 v j d t e x 12 e e i i 1 i 1 n e i i 1 1 i 2 n e i j 0 i j 1 n j i i 1 where j m and n are number of levels equipped with the damper the total number of levels equipped with a damper and number dofs respectively parameter x 0 represents the initial displacement of the spring k 0 is the stiffness of the spring x is displacement of the damper and c 0 represents viscous damping the yielding strength of mr fluid varies straightly with the magnetic field intensity and the applied voltage eqns 13 and 14 show the dependency of the force generated by the mr damper on the input voltage talatahari et al 2012 13 α u α a α b u 14 c 0 u c 0 a c o b u parameter u is a first order output filter which is calculated in eqn 15 15 u j η j u j v j where v j is the applied voltage to the damper for the current generation as can be seen from the governing equations of the damper voltage plays a significant role in the computation of damper force from a mathematical point of view the damper force is sensitive to voltage moreover the damper force is directly used when computing the structural response and the objective function j hence a set of voltages which corresponds to the set of dampers is chosen as a particle in the apso algorithm in other words each voltage set presents a particle p the particle p creates its corresponding set of damper force in the next step such forces are applied to the structure and the structural response is computed later the corresponding j p index is evaluated in each time step there are several particles which are iteratively updated to find the best voltage set at that time step eventually in each time step the best particle p b e s t that minimizes j index in eqn 16 is supposed as the best voltage set 16 j t z t t q z t f d t t r f d t q and r are positive matrices that equilibrium the penalty on the excursion of the state variables and the control signals to suppose these amount at first initial values of r 0 01 and q 10 5 had been assumed from gharebaghi and zangooei 2017 to acquire the aim of this paper in the optimization approach several amounts of these weighting parameters were investigated the best values of r and q were chosen according to trial and error comparing the time history diagrams of the input voltages damper forces and structural responses the comparison of the results indicated that the percentages of structural response reductions stayed steady for all the alternatives while a specific collocation of these matrices led to the optimum voltages which caused a great reduction in the number of the times that the dampers would overpass their maximum capacity to be more precise the defined amounts of parameters in eq 17 caused a 42 reduction in the number of times that the applied forces exceeded more than 80 of the dampers capacity 17 q 10 5 i 2 n 2 n r i r r where n is the number of dofs and r is the number of mr dampers fig 3 represents the flowchart of voltage optimization of a semi active control system without kalman filter 3 2 application of kalman filter on the optimum semi active control system state estimation of a dynamic system provides complementary data and increases the accuracy of the control system kalman filter is a recursive estimator that combines known inputs and noise polluted system measurements with theoretical models to provide the optimal state estimation of a system in the least square sense this filter also known as the linear quadratic estimator predicts the current state of a system using a prior state estimation combined with the theoretical model of the system then it modifies its predicted values using the system measurements alves and coelho 2013 kalman filtering algorithm produces estimates of unknown variables after observing a series of measurements over time the monitored measurements contain statistical noise and other inexactitudes the algorithm assesses more accurate values based on a joint probability distribution of amounts than a single measurement applying kalman filter to a linear quadratic regulator lqr results in a linear quadratic gaussian lqg controller in this study the apso algorithm and lqr controller work together in an internal calculation loop as shown in fig 4 in this process the optimal voltages of the mounted mr dampers are ascertained by the apso algorithm like the other optimization algorithms apso needs time to find the best voltage the required time in this phase is considered as process noise besides the time delay between sending the voltage and applying the force by the damper is assumed as measurement noise in addition to process and measurement noises kalman filter needs the current noisy structural responses of the optimized controlled system and the measured responses of the structure in the previous steps such information is considered as initial conditions of the optimized control system at the next time step fig 4 indicates a schematic diagram of an optimal predictive control system which is composed of two engines apso and kalman filter algorithms in the optimization phase the structure is being controlled optimally using the estimations of the kalman filter from the previous step the recursive kalman filtering algorithm works in two steps prediction update process after several steps spent on observation of noisy responses the filter starts to get on predicting the current uncertain state variables x ˆ k this prediction is accomplished using the estimated state of the structure measured by the filter at the previous time step x k 1 this value is assumed to be zero at the first stage and the calculated optimum control force at the current time u k in the update step once the current noisy measurements y k have been observed the estimates would be updated using a weighted average to be defined more certainly the estimated structural state x k is assumed as the initial condition of the optimum control system for the next time step 3 3 numerical example an offshore platform has been considered to explain the procedure of the proposed system this structure is composed of a jacket deck and piles parts the jacket of the platform is about 70 m tall and has four legs asgarian et al 2004 the factual model had too many dofs to be handled for optimization control computation hence the offshore structure is simplified as a multi degree of freedom mdof shear building the dynamic characteristics of the streamlined model are close to those of the real structure the stiffness of each story in the simplified model is calculated considering the stiffness of all corresponding structural elements as presented in eqns 18 and 19 18 k b i 1 n b e a i l i c o s 2 θ i 19 k l i 1 n l 12 e i i l i 3 where k b is related to the stiffness of bay braced action and k l is related to leg pile frame actions in addition e is the modulus of elasticity of steel a is the cross section area of the diagonal braces i is moment of inertia of the legs piles l is the length of the i t h member and θ represents the angel between the brace and horizon in a real offshore structure mass is widely distributed throughout the structure in the simplified model the mass of each floor of the jacket is centered on its level and includes the mass sum of structural elements entrapped fluid marine growth and added mass of the members mass of the deck consists of dead live load and total mass of all equipment on the deck damping matrix c is obtained based on caughey s damping model 20 c m l 0 n 1 a l m 1 k l where m and k are mass and stiffness of the structure coefficient a l is obtained from eqn 21 21 ζ n 1 2 l 0 n 1 a l ω n 2 l 1 where ζ n is the damping ratio which is deemed to be equal to 5 3 as structural damping and 2 as hydrodynamic added damping in the current study and ω n is the natural frequency of the n t h mode in formulating the simple five degrees of freedom model no rotation is considered for horizontal sections at the floor levels notwithstanding not idealized system matrices due to simplifying assumptions in the studied case the numerical simulation of the system using the identified matrices agrees well with the experimentally measured response fig 5 represents the schematic configuration of the model levels of the jacket and the deck section with the insertion of mr dampers to prove the claim about the best location of the dampers the performance of the mr dampers on different levels of the platform was investigated and displacement time histories of the deck in those conditions under the el centro earthquake have been compared the bar chart shown in fig 6 demonstrates the percentages of the platform s deck displacement reduction under the el centro earthquake for applying mr dampers on different levels of the structure the results prove that the supposed level is the best place to put the dampers to repress the acceleration response of the deck in resistance to earthquake induced vibrations d equals to 0 0 0 1 1 t and the natural periods of the simplified model are shown in table 2 as was mentioned before the platform is located in the persian gulf moreover the soil could be categorized as type c based on api rp 2 a 2000 all earthquakes have been scaled according to the standard response spectra introduced in c 2 3 6 2 of a 2000 for strength and rare intensity ductility level earthquakes table 3 shows the peak ground acceleration pga of the scaled earthquakes as the only behavior of the platform in x dir is studied in this paper the deck is equipped with four parallel mr dampers in x direction fig 7 portrays the location of the dampers each damper has a capacity of 100 tons in which the total capacity of the dampers is close to 0 7 percent of the total weight of the structure 14000 tons n p is the number of random voltages entered to the dampers and n iter is the number of repetitions to update the velocity and state of the particle voltage to find the optimum response although an increase in these numbers takes more time it may have no positive trace to find the optimum voltage thus the number of voltages and iterations that would minimize the j index had been found through measuring the minimum amount of j 2 for several amounts of np and niter np 5 5 to 20 and niter 5 5 to 20 in this paper the assumed amounts np 10 and niter 10 have resulted in the least amount of j index table 4 shows the required parameters of the mr damper taken from reference mohebbi and bagherkhani 2014 for practical purposes measurement noises should be accessible by the use of sensors such research needs a full state measurement the authors had no access to experimental results thus as it takes near to 0 1 0 4 s for a long stroke mr damper to reach its proper control function zemp et al 2016 in this study the measurement noise is assumed according to 0 2 s time delay for example if an earthquake has a sampling interval of 0 01 s the white uncorrelated measurement noise would be 20 variants discrete gaussian process with zero mean and covariance matrix of estimated structural responses at the same step and measured responses at twenty steps before since in the numerical analysis process noise takes the value of variance of the external excitation mei et al 2002 in this study the process noise was considered the constant value of 0 01 according to real time hybrid test of an offshore platform with mr dampers yuen et al 2013 4 solver verification to verify the accuracy and precision of the implemented algorithm it is necessary to check out the results for some known cases in this section three examples are presented to perform numerical verification first example for numerical simulation of the studied optimization control algorithm without kalman filter deck acceleration of the presented platform table 3 had been compared with runge kutta fourth order method the structure had been excited subjected to the el centro earthquake at strength level with time step 0 005 and the responses are shown in fig 8 root mean square amount of these responses is 2 8 percent for acceleration and 0 068 percent for velocity of the deck therefore the accuracy of the studied method would be confirmed second example a three story shear building with the modeling parameters presented in table 5 is considered to compare apso controlling algorithm with chaotic particle swarm optimization cpso gharebaghi and zangooei 2017 and lattice type probabilistic neural network lpnn method kim et al 2008 time history and magnitude of the control force is not evidence in the lpnn study however the control force is limited to a specific range of 200 200 n in the presented comparative study for the two other cases the controlled and uncontrolled responses of the 3rd floor under the el centro 1940 earthquake are shown in fig 9 moreover the reduction factor of the structural responses by these three mentioned methods for el centro 1940 california 1952 and northridge 1994 earthquakes are displayed in table 6 although considering the actual limited control force in apso and cpso methods the 3rd floor reduction factors by these control systems are more than this factor in the lpnn study the small difference in reduction factors of two active cpso and semi active apso control systems is because of various optimization algorithms and different manner of tendons and mr dampers as a result the correctness of the studied optimization control system apso in this paper can be concluded from the proximity of its reduction factor values of a three story building s displacement and velocity to the obtained quantities by cpso in table 6 third example to verify the whole algorithm all the noises entered to the kalman filter were set to zero moreover the results of the algorithm were compared with their counterparts when the structure had been optimally controlled in the absence of kalman filter this way it is possible to investigate whether or not the kalman filter has been improperly implemented or has a negative impact on the accuracy of the results the model is the platform presented in section 3 3 the comparison is shown in fig 10 where both results of the deck displacement seem to be identical for the northridge earthquake at strength level in this section the accuracy of the solver and the apso optimizer were investigated besides the kalman filter was checked out for a special case where all noises were set to zero the results show that all segments of the studied algorithm are working properly in the next section the main problem is defined and solved using the presented algorithm 5 numerical simulation in this section two far field and three near field earthquakes are applied to the simplified model of the platform presented in section 3 3 figs 11 15 show a descent in the displacement of the optimally controlled platform s levels using kalman filter according to subjected strength and ductility level earthquakes the studied method causes a significant decrease in the absolute displacement and drift of the deck which have been shown in figs 11 15 reductions of maximum response of the controlled platform under delta calipatria el centro calexico and northridge earthquakes at strength level are 46 20 22 38 and 13 percent for the deck and about 30 60 15 46 and 28 percent for other levels of the platform respectively due to more intense excitation by earthquakes at ductility level reduced responses of the controlled structure under these earthquakes are less than ones at strength level figs 16 20 depict displacement time histories of the deck under resistance level earthquakes for three uncontrolled controlled without kalman filter and controlled with kalman filter conditions on the one hand from figs 16 to 20 it may be concluded that the modified controller has a low efficiency for instance in fig 16 the response reduction in the time interval of 5 10 seconds is negligible fig 17 shows that such a reduction could be neglected in the time interval of 9 10 seconds similarly figs 18 20 show the same behavior at the beginning of the excitations on the other hand the controller extremely reduces the structural response by the passage of time it can be seen that the responses are significantly reduced approximately from one third of the time span to the end of the analysis this could be interpreted by the nature of the kalman filter and the designed algorithm in fact for the beginning of the excitation the kalman filter has not enough or effective information about the state variables thus the predictions have noticeable errors however by the passage of time the kalman filter has a better understanding of the state variables and the behavior of the structure all the above descriptive results are similar for ductility level earthquakes tables 7 and 8 provide the root mean square rms values of the offshore platform s displacement responses while applying kalman filter subsection 3 2 and without filtering subsection 3 1 for the two strength and ductility levels of the earthquakes respectively according to figs 16 to 20 and tables 7 and 8 it is concluded that structural response of the controlled with and without kalman filter systems are closer to each other for two far field earthquakes in comparison with near field earthquakes as a result the kalman filter would improve response reduction of the structure under near field earthquakes more than far field ones the results show all the defined criteria are in the same order for controller with or without kalman filter however it should be noted that using the controller without kalman filter eliminates all delays which do exist in computational efforts and damper reaction more precisely the results show that the designed algorithm not only considers such delays but retain the defined criteria in the same order and close to the ideal case where there is no delay thus the presented algorithm is closer to reality where there are delays in all segments of the control system one of the optimization criteria is increasing the operating life of the actuators well operation of kalman filter in reducing the absorbed energy by the structure with less or equal work of the dampers has been conducted from the above tables large scale structures especially offshore platforms are hard to access and maintain thus most of the attempts are focused on the design of proper and durable control systems on these structures moreover the biggest amounts of damper forces are produced in the moments that a structure is under intense external excitations in this study the damper force of the controlled structure is restricted in a range of 1000 kn in most earthquakes except northridge the maximum applied force is up to 60 80 percent of the damper s capacity fig 21 depicts the time history of the damper force under the northridge earthquake at strength level in the most critical 10 s duration as concluded from fig 21 the kalman filter improves the performance of the dampers in the tensest condition and reduces the work done by the dampers about 15 percent since less work requires less voltage variation the kalman filter lessens depreciation and prolongs the lifetime of the dampers in addition depreciation is an important factor that decreases the functional life span of any device this phenomenon raises the risk of a damper s failure as a result any decline in the number of times that an actuator reaches close to its peak capacity aids the duration of the damper s operation life considering this issue in this paper the number of times that the dampers exceed the limit of 60 tons under strength level earthquakes has been measured after applying the kalman filter to the optimized semi active control system the dampers experienced a reduction in the number of times overpassing the amount of 60 tons this decrease was about 20 for the el centro cali patria calexico and northridge earthquakes and about 67 for the delta earthquake 6 conclusions in this paper the performance of a newly designed fixed offshore platform in the persian gulf equipped by mr dampers subjected to near and far field earthquakes in two levels of strength and ductility has been studied the semi active control of the structure has been applied optimally through linear quadratic regulator lqr and adaptive particle swarm optimization apso methods computational efforts of the optimization algorithm noisy sensors and damper reflection result in time delays which lower the performance of the control system by inserting a wrong compound force to the structure thus this paper has addressed this problem by means of a kalman filter on the semi active control system to estimate the structural responses while considering the probable errors since a full state estimation requires experimental data and observations the authors tried to make some logical assumptions for the process and measurement noises of the kalman filter in a virtual laboratory in agreement with previous experimental studies simulation results obtained have shown that the studied approach on the platform leads to maximum displacement reductions between 60 90 and 30 60 for near and far field earthquakes respectively meanwhile the maximum displacement of the main deck is suppressed between 15 and 40 for the near field and 15 46 for the far field earthquakes furthermore the kinetic energy of the deck and its underfloor is averagely reduced by 75 for the near field earthquakes the numerical study shows that the investigated method extends the lifetime of the dampers however the modified control algorithm in the presence of the kalman filter is capable of considering time delays the proposed control method can be used in the real world if

21945,semi active control is one of the most effective methods for damage reduction in offshore platforms subjected to intense environmental forces despite its advantages probable device time delays may drastically decrease the real performance of the control algorithm thus the uncertainty could make the control process non optimal in this paper a kalman filter is used to ponder previous responses and the history of the measured errors in order to estimate the real state variables of an offshore structure equipped with magneto rheological mr dampers in the current article the amount of applied voltage to the mr damper is optimized via the adaptive particle swarm optimization apso method furthermore the structure is controlled by the linear quadratic regulator lqr algorithm a newly installed offshore platform located in the persian gulf at a depth of 64 m is considered as an example to demonstrate the performance of the controller the offshore structure is assumed to be excited by near and far field earthquakes the results of the parametric studies indicate that all the earthquake induced vibrations of the platform can be effectively suppressed by the designed control system moreover the life spans of the dampers may increase with the predicting optimizing algorithm graphical abstract a predictor optimizing semi active control system is designed to reduce structural responses of a fixed metal offshore platform equipped by horizontal mr dampers under earthquake excitations the controller estimates the responses of the structure considering probable noises to reduce the time delays and inefficient actuator forces in addition the inlet voltages of the dampers are optimized to develop the dampers duration and reduce the structural responses image 1 keywords semi active control control of offshore platforms mr damper adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm kalman filter 1 introduction offshore structures play a significant role in the extraction of fossil fuels safety and resilience of such structures is a critical issue in oil production and the economy of a country offshore platforms are regularly subjected to environmental loadings such as waves sea storms severe winds ship collisions and earthquakes to reduce the structural response of offshore structures and on the other hand to increase its safety several control strategies have been investigated in the previous studies which could be divided into four groups of passive active semi active and hybrid controlling systems semi active control systems are capable of generating significant forces using a small amount of input energy besides in the absence of external energy they could be supposed as a passive control device because of the practical limitation of other damping devices semi active control systems are more convenient moreover mr damper is an effective semi active control device which could be utilized to diminish the response of offshore platforms li et al studied a single degree of freedom sdof platform equipped with mr dampers and demonstrated a remarkable reduction not only in the maximum responses but in the corresponding root mean square rms values however they did not describe how to implement the control system li and wang 2002 wan et al worked on a fuzzy logic semi active control system they used a fuzzy controller to obtain optimal control force by considering the error of the displacement response of the offshore platforms and errors of the input variables wan et al 2007 optimization is a systematic process which makes the most usage of a system with the least losses based on the set of certain constraints and criteria the most important objective in the optimization of a controlled structure would be to design a high level of safety and an accurate control system with the lowest cost the optimization algorithms can be categorized into at least two types of classical and meta heuristic for simple continuous and linear problems classical algorithms are commonly used however for more complex problems meta heuristics algorithms such as genetic algorithm ga ant colony algorithm aca and particle swarm optimization pso algorithm are better alternatives because of their stability and flexibility wang et al 2018 pso is a prevalent optimization method which was introduced by kennedy and eberhart in 1995 this method is based on the social behavior of animals pso is an appropriate method for solving discrete nonlinear and non integrative problems rashed et al 2007 pso quietly similar to the ga are two evolutionary search methods which change from a set of points to another set of points within an iteration with visible improvement from the previous values using some probabilistic and deterministic rules despite the high capabilities of the ga in solving complex problems high implementation cost and usually requirement of a higher number of iterations are its drawbacks shabir and singla professor 2016 it worth noting that time is a noticeable parameter for controlling a structure during an earthquake excitation hence when the number of iterations in an optimization algorithm is declined the controlled system performance is enriched as a result pso could be an optimization algorithm with lower complexity and a number of iterations besides the results of a set of researches displayed that pso outperforms the ga in computational efficiency hassan et al 2004 in addition pso has a high convergence rate in which particles may be trapped in a local minimum consequently the original pso algorithm needs to be improved in such a way that it prevents particles from being trapped therefore some evolutionary models have been suggested to overcome this obstacle chuang et al 2011 2012 chuanwen and bompard 2005 liu and han 2005 adaptive particle swarm optimization apso algorithm resolves the issue and simultaneously increases the accuracy of the solution ide and yasuda proposed adaptive pso and demonstrated its effectiveness and feasibility of simulations ide and yasuda 2005 zhan et al extended pso to apso using a new approach and substantially improved the performance of the pso algorithm in terms of convergence speed global optimality solution accuracy and algorithm reliability zhan et al 2009 optimal control of a structure is a time consuming process all computational efforts in the numerical solutions of the governing equations and meta heuristic optimization need time to be completed as well all efforts are repeated for each time interval during the external excitation additionally the received data by the sensors are not exact according to the above mentioned facts it may not be possible to claim that the structures have been optimally controlled chuang et al 2011 in most of the researches in civil engineering the delays have been neglected or not properly defined for instance césar et al did not assume any time delays for their studied semi active control system césar et al 2019 and bathaei et al did not mention the amount of uncertainty they took for the semi active control of their survey bathaei et al 2018 while a typical example of the time delay has been demonstrated by gharebaghi and zangooei 2017 they have proposed a chaotic map to improve the original pso algorithm and studied the time delay in the numerical computations in optimal control of shear buildings to fully measure the state of a system the errors caused by the system s time delays should be deliberated the present paper is an attempt to apply the hinted delays in the control algorithm more precisely this article deals with time delays and noises the paper uses a kalman filter to predict the state variables of the system at each moment when the control force is applied subsequently in the process of computing the best control force the delays noises and predicted state variables are examined simultaneously finally the result of the method would be closer to real world experiments where computers and control devices need time to compute the best forces and react kalman filter as an optimal state estimator can lessen the errors of both the calculation process and the measured values by the control devices to the optimum level based on the time delay between sending orders and receiving the responses therefore it provides an updated model of a real time controlled system by prediction of structural responses simon 2006 kalman filter has been used in various research fields for example in 2011 bin et al studied a real time hybrid test rht model of a platform equipped with semi active mr dampers and base isolators in the gulf of china they predicted the platform response by implementing the acceleration on the deck more accurately for ice excitations albeit they ignored time delay of mr dampers and sensors and considered constant noises for kalman filter wu et al 2011 papadimitriou et al predicted the fatigue life of low sensitivity steel structures using a kalman filter papadimitriou et al 2011 in another work the lifetime of an offshore platform under structural loads had been investigated via kalman filtering periši ć et al 2014 ren et al measured the life of a platform by monitoring the fatigue of truss members and estimating the strain response of the platform ren and zhou 2014 in addition ren et al implemented the augmented kalman filter to monitor the health of truss structures and measure structural responses accurately ren and zhou 2017 in this study a simplified model of a newly installed jacket type offshore platform in the persian gulf studied by asgarian et al 2004 has been supplied with semi active mr dampers in order to reduce the responses of the structures under strong ground motions the mr dampers embedded horizontally between the deck and the jacket of the platform are compliant with the bouc wen model the optimum voltage of the damper is computed using the apso algorithm and the optimization controlled system is designed by the lqr technique the simulations have been performed using two far field and three near field earthquakes in two levels of strength and ductility the kalman filter has been applied to predict the response of the platform and decrease the errors of the optimization controlled system it is notable that a full real time hybrid test is required when using the kalman filter however because of the lack of accessing real measurements the current study assumes a linear kalman filter with a normal distribution of noises for long stroke mr dampers and low noisy sensors the mentioned assumptions are made in such a way that they are in agreement with their real counterparts matisko and havlena 2010 wu et al 2011 yuen et al 2013 in fact the implemented software is capable of simulating a full virtual laboratory to investigate the performance of the control algorithm compared to previous studies all possible errors had been considered in this paper which increases the accuracy of practical results 2 optimization of semi active control system the objective of structural control is to improve the performance of a structure subjected to external forces via response and absorbed energy reduction however there are some conditions that should be held in the minimization of the response and the absorbed energy 2 1 optimization particle swarm optimization is a meta heuristic algorithm based on the collective behavior of birds and fish when searching for food in this algorithm each agent or particle has a location and velocity in the search space in the first step of the algorithm a predefined number of agents particles are randomly distributed throughout the search space next the objective function is evaluated for each agent for the first iteration each particle saves its evaluation value noted by p b e s t during the next iterations the current evaluation of each particle is compared with the previous best value of that particle and its p b e s t is updated if required in each step there is a global best value which is the best of p b e s t values it is denoted by g b e s t and the corresponding particle is identified as the best particle in the current iteration the best particle is assumed to be the solution to the optimization problem at the end of the current iteration thus all of the other agents move toward the best particle in fact the location of each agent is updated by its velocity the velocity of each particle is computed exerting its individual memory its location and p b e s t and the experience of the group g b e s t as presented in eqn 1 at the end of the current iteration the location of each particle is updated using eqn 2 talukder 2011 1 v i j k 1 w v i j k c 1 r 1 j k p b e s t i k x i j k c 2 r 2 j k g b e s t x i j k i 1 2 n 2 x i j k 1 x i j k v i j k 1 where i j n k are particle number particle dimension number number of total particle and stages of update respectively the inertia weight w first introduced by shi and eberhart in 1999 shi et al 1999 balances the global and local search capabilities c 1 and c 2 are acceleration coefficients and r 1 and r 2 are two independent randomly generated numbers within 0 1 the advantages of the pso algorithm include memory capacity high convergence speed easy implementation and fewer parameters in such an algorithm all particles collaborate and share their experience and memory to find the best solution the method is simply implemented has few parameters and a high convergence speed an evolutionary state estimation ese approach has been developed to control the pso algorithm more objectively and optimally zhan et al 2009 the ese approach not only considers agents information but espies the behavior of the agents and their distribution in each generation to this end the mean distance of each particle from all the other particles is calculated with eqn 3 then an evolutionary factor is calculated using eqn 4 to classify the fuzzy membership functions into one of the four evolutionary states exploration s 1 exploitation s 2 convergence s 3 and jumping out s 4 the membership functions are presented in fig 1 zhan et al 2009 3 d i 1 n 1 j 1 j i n k 1 d x i k x j k 2 4 f d g d m i n d m a x d m i n 0 1 where i indicates the computed distance for i t h agent additionally n is the population size and d is the number of dimensions besides d g d m a x and d m i n are the globally best particle the maximum and minimum distance of d i respectively in this paper the inertia weight w is monotonic with the evolutionary factor f and would be adapted to the search environment characterized by f which is given in eqn 5 it has been shown that the inertia weigh prevents particles from being trapped in local minima zhan et al 2009 5 w 1 1 1 5 e 2 6 f 0 4 0 9 f 0 1 the acceleration coefficients c 1 and c 2 in companion with inertia weight prevent particle clustering in local minima the parameter c 1 maintains the diversity of the swarm while c 2 makes the swarm converge to the current globally best region in this research these coefficients are initialized to 2 0 and adaptively controlled according to the introduced strategies in evolutionary state according to the strategies shown in table 1 in order to avoid the irruption of the acceleration coefficients the maximum increase and decrease between the two generations is bounded by eqn 6 6 c i g 1 c i g δ i 1 2 where g is the generation index representing the current number of evolutionary generations and δ is auniformly generated random variable in the range of 0 05 0 1 it is important to note that for exploitation and convergence the amount of δ is divided by 2 subsequently if the summation amount of c 1 and c 2 is greater than four both coefficients should be normalized as eqn 7 7 c i c i c 1 c 2 4 0 i 1 2 when a structure is excited it absorbs energy at least in the form of kinetic energy which is related to the velocity and potential energy due to structural deformation to control structural response one may apply a huge amount of control force which needs a considerable amount of external energy for practical purposes there is a limit of external energy thus in optimal control it is desired to reduce the amount of external energy and structural response as well such energies could be expressed by a performance index j which will be presented later in eqn 16 the index contains not only the structural absorbed energy but also the amount of damper force the optimization algorithm which was presented in this section could be utilized in optimal semi active control of structures where the best control force is computed to minimize j in each time step 2 2 mr damper and bouc wen model magneto rheological damper is one of the most promising devices for structural vibration reduction because of the advantages of large force capacity against less external power this device is built up by a hydraulic cylinder that contains mr fluid mr fluids usually consist of 20 40 suspended micron sized about 3 5 μm in diameter pure iron carbonyls dispersed in a carrier medium such as mineral or silicone oil mr fluids can change their mechanical properties linear viscose liquid to semi solid with the aid of magnetic flux electric current within a few milliseconds bahar and chaibakhsh 2011 as a result the variation of the inlet voltage which could create a large damping force is a significant parameter to control the structural responses moreover mr fluids can operate at temperatures from 40 to 150 c with only slight variations in the yield stress spencer et al 1997 the flux dependent shear strength of mr fluid depends on several factors including the size composition volume fraction of the particles and also the strength of the applied magnetic field khan et al 2014 fig 2 is a schematic view of the details of an mr damper in structures especially with non elastic characters which exhibit hysteresis behavior under dynamic pressure the restoring force depends on the moment of the displacement and the past events of the structure for this reason the proper modeling of the system is an important issue sapiński et al 2003 bouc wen model as one of the earliest models has been used extensively in describing the hysteretic behavior of mr dampers every functional step of voltage optimization process and command signal transition from a digital controller to an actuator consumes time any disregard for these time delays results in a non optimal control system which causes more structural damages by inserting inaccurate control forces in the wrong times sensors actuators and a digital control room are the main parts of a controlling system in real time control of a system the external excitations and structural responses can be measured by the sensors placed on different parts of the structure however despite the noise of the sensors due to operational limitations it is not possible to distribute enough sensors all over the structure noticing the probable faults in electrical devices the kalman filtering algorithm estimates the state of a system and aids in the production of precise control force while considering the mechanical errors and the time spent on the optimization algorithm process numerical model of an optimized semi active control algorithm modified with kalman filter is presented in the next section 3 numerical modeling in this section two numerical simulations are performed while the first simulation assumes no delay in the control process the second simulation utilizes a kalman filter to represent a more realistic model both models apply the apso algorithm to determine the optimum voltage of mr dampers to control an offshore structure under earthquake loading 3 1 optimum control in the absence of the kalman filter the governing equation of the structure is presented in eqn 8 where x x and x are displacement velocity and acceleration vectors respectively additionally m c k f d l and x g are mass damping stiffness damper force a vector filled by 1 and ground acceleration correspondingly and matrix d is used to apply the damper force on the stories where the damper is located the governing equation demonstrates how the behavior of the damper is coupled with the structural response 8 m x c x k x d f d m l x g according to the bouc wen model the damper force f d evolutionary variable z and the relative velocity along two sides of mr damper v are obtained from eqns 9 12 şahin et al 2010 9 f d j c 0 a j c 0 b j u j v j k 0 x x 0 α a j α b j u j z j j 1 m 10 z j γ j v j z j z j n 1 β j v j z j n a j v j 11 v j d t e x 12 e e i i 1 i 1 n e i i 1 1 i 2 n e i j 0 i j 1 n j i i 1 where j m and n are number of levels equipped with the damper the total number of levels equipped with a damper and number dofs respectively parameter x 0 represents the initial displacement of the spring k 0 is the stiffness of the spring x is displacement of the damper and c 0 represents viscous damping the yielding strength of mr fluid varies straightly with the magnetic field intensity and the applied voltage eqns 13 and 14 show the dependency of the force generated by the mr damper on the input voltage talatahari et al 2012 13 α u α a α b u 14 c 0 u c 0 a c o b u parameter u is a first order output filter which is calculated in eqn 15 15 u j η j u j v j where v j is the applied voltage to the damper for the current generation as can be seen from the governing equations of the damper voltage plays a significant role in the computation of damper force from a mathematical point of view the damper force is sensitive to voltage moreover the damper force is directly used when computing the structural response and the objective function j hence a set of voltages which corresponds to the set of dampers is chosen as a particle in the apso algorithm in other words each voltage set presents a particle p the particle p creates its corresponding set of damper force in the next step such forces are applied to the structure and the structural response is computed later the corresponding j p index is evaluated in each time step there are several particles which are iteratively updated to find the best voltage set at that time step eventually in each time step the best particle p b e s t that minimizes j index in eqn 16 is supposed as the best voltage set 16 j t z t t q z t f d t t r f d t q and r are positive matrices that equilibrium the penalty on the excursion of the state variables and the control signals to suppose these amount at first initial values of r 0 01 and q 10 5 had been assumed from gharebaghi and zangooei 2017 to acquire the aim of this paper in the optimization approach several amounts of these weighting parameters were investigated the best values of r and q were chosen according to trial and error comparing the time history diagrams of the input voltages damper forces and structural responses the comparison of the results indicated that the percentages of structural response reductions stayed steady for all the alternatives while a specific collocation of these matrices led to the optimum voltages which caused a great reduction in the number of the times that the dampers would overpass their maximum capacity to be more precise the defined amounts of parameters in eq 17 caused a 42 reduction in the number of times that the applied forces exceeded more than 80 of the dampers capacity 17 q 10 5 i 2 n 2 n r i r r where n is the number of dofs and r is the number of mr dampers fig 3 represents the flowchart of voltage optimization of a semi active control system without kalman filter 3 2 application of kalman filter on the optimum semi active control system state estimation of a dynamic system provides complementary data and increases the accuracy of the control system kalman filter is a recursive estimator that combines known inputs and noise polluted system measurements with theoretical models to provide the optimal state estimation of a system in the least square sense this filter also known as the linear quadratic estimator predicts the current state of a system using a prior state estimation combined with the theoretical model of the system then it modifies its predicted values using the system measurements alves and coelho 2013 kalman filtering algorithm produces estimates of unknown variables after observing a series of measurements over time the monitored measurements contain statistical noise and other inexactitudes the algorithm assesses more accurate values based on a joint probability distribution of amounts than a single measurement applying kalman filter to a linear quadratic regulator lqr results in a linear quadratic gaussian lqg controller in this study the apso algorithm and lqr controller work together in an internal calculation loop as shown in fig 4 in this process the optimal voltages of the mounted mr dampers are ascertained by the apso algorithm like the other optimization algorithms apso needs time to find the best voltage the required time in this phase is considered as process noise besides the time delay between sending the voltage and applying the force by the damper is assumed as measurement noise in addition to process and measurement noises kalman filter needs the current noisy structural responses of the optimized controlled system and the measured responses of the structure in the previous steps such information is considered as initial conditions of the optimized control system at the next time step fig 4 indicates a schematic diagram of an optimal predictive control system which is composed of two engines apso and kalman filter algorithms in the optimization phase the structure is being controlled optimally using the estimations of the kalman filter from the previous step the recursive kalman filtering algorithm works in two steps prediction update process after several steps spent on observation of noisy responses the filter starts to get on predicting the current uncertain state variables x ˆ k this prediction is accomplished using the estimated state of the structure measured by the filter at the previous time step x k 1 this value is assumed to be zero at the first stage and the calculated optimum control force at the current time u k in the update step once the current noisy measurements y k have been observed the estimates would be updated using a weighted average to be defined more certainly the estimated structural state x k is assumed as the initial condition of the optimum control system for the next time step 3 3 numerical example an offshore platform has been considered to explain the procedure of the proposed system this structure is composed of a jacket deck and piles parts the jacket of the platform is about 70 m tall and has four legs asgarian et al 2004 the factual model had too many dofs to be handled for optimization control computation hence the offshore structure is simplified as a multi degree of freedom mdof shear building the dynamic characteristics of the streamlined model are close to those of the real structure the stiffness of each story in the simplified model is calculated considering the stiffness of all corresponding structural elements as presented in eqns 18 and 19 18 k b i 1 n b e a i l i c o s 2 θ i 19 k l i 1 n l 12 e i i l i 3 where k b is related to the stiffness of bay braced action and k l is related to leg pile frame actions in addition e is the modulus of elasticity of steel a is the cross section area of the diagonal braces i is moment of inertia of the legs piles l is the length of the i t h member and θ represents the angel between the brace and horizon in a real offshore structure mass is widely distributed throughout the structure in the simplified model the mass of each floor of the jacket is centered on its level and includes the mass sum of structural elements entrapped fluid marine growth and added mass of the members mass of the deck consists of dead live load and total mass of all equipment on the deck damping matrix c is obtained based on caughey s damping model 20 c m l 0 n 1 a l m 1 k l where m and k are mass and stiffness of the structure coefficient a l is obtained from eqn 21 21 ζ n 1 2 l 0 n 1 a l ω n 2 l 1 where ζ n is the damping ratio which is deemed to be equal to 5 3 as structural damping and 2 as hydrodynamic added damping in the current study and ω n is the natural frequency of the n t h mode in formulating the simple five degrees of freedom model no rotation is considered for horizontal sections at the floor levels notwithstanding not idealized system matrices due to simplifying assumptions in the studied case the numerical simulation of the system using the identified matrices agrees well with the experimentally measured response fig 5 represents the schematic configuration of the model levels of the jacket and the deck section with the insertion of mr dampers to prove the claim about the best location of the dampers the performance of the mr dampers on different levels of the platform was investigated and displacement time histories of the deck in those conditions under the el centro earthquake have been compared the bar chart shown in fig 6 demonstrates the percentages of the platform s deck displacement reduction under the el centro earthquake for applying mr dampers on different levels of the structure the results prove that the supposed level is the best place to put the dampers to repress the acceleration response of the deck in resistance to earthquake induced vibrations d equals to 0 0 0 1 1 t and the natural periods of the simplified model are shown in table 2 as was mentioned before the platform is located in the persian gulf moreover the soil could be categorized as type c based on api rp 2 a 2000 all earthquakes have been scaled according to the standard response spectra introduced in c 2 3 6 2 of a 2000 for strength and rare intensity ductility level earthquakes table 3 shows the peak ground acceleration pga of the scaled earthquakes as the only behavior of the platform in x dir is studied in this paper the deck is equipped with four parallel mr dampers in x direction fig 7 portrays the location of the dampers each damper has a capacity of 100 tons in which the total capacity of the dampers is close to 0 7 percent of the total weight of the structure 14000 tons n p is the number of random voltages entered to the dampers and n iter is the number of repetitions to update the velocity and state of the particle voltage to find the optimum response although an increase in these numbers takes more time it may have no positive trace to find the optimum voltage thus the number of voltages and iterations that would minimize the j index had been found through measuring the minimum amount of j 2 for several amounts of np and niter np 5 5 to 20 and niter 5 5 to 20 in this paper the assumed amounts np 10 and niter 10 have resulted in the least amount of j index table 4 shows the required parameters of the mr damper taken from reference mohebbi and bagherkhani 2014 for practical purposes measurement noises should be accessible by the use of sensors such research needs a full state measurement the authors had no access to experimental results thus as it takes near to 0 1 0 4 s for a long stroke mr damper to reach its proper control function zemp et al 2016 in this study the measurement noise is assumed according to 0 2 s time delay for example if an earthquake has a sampling interval of 0 01 s the white uncorrelated measurement noise would be 20 variants discrete gaussian process with zero mean and covariance matrix of estimated structural responses at the same step and measured responses at twenty steps before since in the numerical analysis process noise takes the value of variance of the external excitation mei et al 2002 in this study the process noise was considered the constant value of 0 01 according to real time hybrid test of an offshore platform with mr dampers yuen et al 2013 4 solver verification to verify the accuracy and precision of the implemented algorithm it is necessary to check out the results for some known cases in this section three examples are presented to perform numerical verification first example for numerical simulation of the studied optimization control algorithm without kalman filter deck acceleration of the presented platform table 3 had been compared with runge kutta fourth order method the structure had been excited subjected to the el centro earthquake at strength level with time step 0 005 and the responses are shown in fig 8 root mean square amount of these responses is 2 8 percent for acceleration and 0 068 percent for velocity of the deck therefore the accuracy of the studied method would be confirmed second example a three story shear building with the modeling parameters presented in table 5 is considered to compare apso controlling algorithm with chaotic particle swarm optimization cpso gharebaghi and zangooei 2017 and lattice type probabilistic neural network lpnn method kim et al 2008 time history and magnitude of the control force is not evidence in the lpnn study however the control force is limited to a specific range of 200 200 n in the presented comparative study for the two other cases the controlled and uncontrolled responses of the 3rd floor under the el centro 1940 earthquake are shown in fig 9 moreover the reduction factor of the structural responses by these three mentioned methods for el centro 1940 california 1952 and northridge 1994 earthquakes are displayed in table 6 although considering the actual limited control force in apso and cpso methods the 3rd floor reduction factors by these control systems are more than this factor in the lpnn study the small difference in reduction factors of two active cpso and semi active apso control systems is because of various optimization algorithms and different manner of tendons and mr dampers as a result the correctness of the studied optimization control system apso in this paper can be concluded from the proximity of its reduction factor values of a three story building s displacement and velocity to the obtained quantities by cpso in table 6 third example to verify the whole algorithm all the noises entered to the kalman filter were set to zero moreover the results of the algorithm were compared with their counterparts when the structure had been optimally controlled in the absence of kalman filter this way it is possible to investigate whether or not the kalman filter has been improperly implemented or has a negative impact on the accuracy of the results the model is the platform presented in section 3 3 the comparison is shown in fig 10 where both results of the deck displacement seem to be identical for the northridge earthquake at strength level in this section the accuracy of the solver and the apso optimizer were investigated besides the kalman filter was checked out for a special case where all noises were set to zero the results show that all segments of the studied algorithm are working properly in the next section the main problem is defined and solved using the presented algorithm 5 numerical simulation in this section two far field and three near field earthquakes are applied to the simplified model of the platform presented in section 3 3 figs 11 15 show a descent in the displacement of the optimally controlled platform s levels using kalman filter according to subjected strength and ductility level earthquakes the studied method causes a significant decrease in the absolute displacement and drift of the deck which have been shown in figs 11 15 reductions of maximum response of the controlled platform under delta calipatria el centro calexico and northridge earthquakes at strength level are 46 20 22 38 and 13 percent for the deck and about 30 60 15 46 and 28 percent for other levels of the platform respectively due to more intense excitation by earthquakes at ductility level reduced responses of the controlled structure under these earthquakes are less than ones at strength level figs 16 20 depict displacement time histories of the deck under resistance level earthquakes for three uncontrolled controlled without kalman filter and controlled with kalman filter conditions on the one hand from figs 16 to 20 it may be concluded that the modified controller has a low efficiency for instance in fig 16 the response reduction in the time interval of 5 10 seconds is negligible fig 17 shows that such a reduction could be neglected in the time interval of 9 10 seconds similarly figs 18 20 show the same behavior at the beginning of the excitations on the other hand the controller extremely reduces the structural response by the passage of time it can be seen that the responses are significantly reduced approximately from one third of the time span to the end of the analysis this could be interpreted by the nature of the kalman filter and the designed algorithm in fact for the beginning of the excitation the kalman filter has not enough or effective information about the state variables thus the predictions have noticeable errors however by the passage of time the kalman filter has a better understanding of the state variables and the behavior of the structure all the above descriptive results are similar for ductility level earthquakes tables 7 and 8 provide the root mean square rms values of the offshore platform s displacement responses while applying kalman filter subsection 3 2 and without filtering subsection 3 1 for the two strength and ductility levels of the earthquakes respectively according to figs 16 to 20 and tables 7 and 8 it is concluded that structural response of the controlled with and without kalman filter systems are closer to each other for two far field earthquakes in comparison with near field earthquakes as a result the kalman filter would improve response reduction of the structure under near field earthquakes more than far field ones the results show all the defined criteria are in the same order for controller with or without kalman filter however it should be noted that using the controller without kalman filter eliminates all delays which do exist in computational efforts and damper reaction more precisely the results show that the designed algorithm not only considers such delays but retain the defined criteria in the same order and close to the ideal case where there is no delay thus the presented algorithm is closer to reality where there are delays in all segments of the control system one of the optimization criteria is increasing the operating life of the actuators well operation of kalman filter in reducing the absorbed energy by the structure with less or equal work of the dampers has been conducted from the above tables large scale structures especially offshore platforms are hard to access and maintain thus most of the attempts are focused on the design of proper and durable control systems on these structures moreover the biggest amounts of damper forces are produced in the moments that a structure is under intense external excitations in this study the damper force of the controlled structure is restricted in a range of 1000 kn in most earthquakes except northridge the maximum applied force is up to 60 80 percent of the damper s capacity fig 21 depicts the time history of the damper force under the northridge earthquake at strength level in the most critical 10 s duration as concluded from fig 21 the kalman filter improves the performance of the dampers in the tensest condition and reduces the work done by the dampers about 15 percent since less work requires less voltage variation the kalman filter lessens depreciation and prolongs the lifetime of the dampers in addition depreciation is an important factor that decreases the functional life span of any device this phenomenon raises the risk of a damper s failure as a result any decline in the number of times that an actuator reaches close to its peak capacity aids the duration of the damper s operation life considering this issue in this paper the number of times that the dampers exceed the limit of 60 tons under strength level earthquakes has been measured after applying the kalman filter to the optimized semi active control system the dampers experienced a reduction in the number of times overpassing the amount of 60 tons this decrease was about 20 for the el centro cali patria calexico and northridge earthquakes and about 67 for the delta earthquake 6 conclusions in this paper the performance of a newly designed fixed offshore platform in the persian gulf equipped by mr dampers subjected to near and far field earthquakes in two levels of strength and ductility has been studied the semi active control of the structure has been applied optimally through linear quadratic regulator lqr and adaptive particle swarm optimization apso methods computational efforts of the optimization algorithm noisy sensors and damper reflection result in time delays which lower the performance of the control system by inserting a wrong compound force to the structure thus this paper has addressed this problem by means of a kalman filter on the semi active control system to estimate the structural responses while considering the probable errors since a full state estimation requires experimental data and observations the authors tried to make some logical assumptions for the process and measurement noises of the kalman filter in a virtual laboratory in agreement with previous experimental studies simulation results obtained have shown that the studied approach on the platform leads to maximum displacement reductions between 60 90 and 30 60 for near and far field earthquakes respectively meanwhile the maximum displacement of the main deck is suppressed between 15 and 40 for the near field and 15 46 for the far field earthquakes furthermore the kinetic energy of the deck and its underfloor is averagely reduced by 75 for the near field earthquakes the numerical study shows that the investigated method extends the lifetime of the dampers however the modified control algorithm in the presence of the kalman filter is capable of considering time delays the proposed control method can be used in the real world if

21946,high speed flow pipes suffer from severe vibration problems when the fluid velocity is higher than the critical value the straight equilibrium configuration of the pipe will lose stability what follows is the supercritical vibration of the pipe near the non trivial static equilibrium configuration this paper attempts to reveal multiple resonance responses of forced vibration of pipes in the supercritical regime based on timoshenko beam theory the nonlinear coupled partial differential equations are deduced the non trivial static equilibrium configuration causes the parameters to vary with space variable the approximate responses of the pipe are obtained and verified numerically the results show that the flow velocity near the critical value is more prone to cause severe vibration unlike in the subcritical regime there are third order super harmonic resonance and second order super harmonic resonance in the supercritical regime so there are more resonance areas in the supercritical regime high flow velocity or large external excitation can aggravate the difference between the euler bernoulli model and the timoshenko model and the relative error of two models varies non monotonically even for slender pipes the difference between the two models is still very clear therefore the timoshenko model is more necessary to analyze the vibration of the high speed pipe keywords fluid conveying pipe timoshenko theory supercritical super harmonic resonances primary resonance 1 introduction fluid conveying pipes for example marine risers oil conveying pipes cooling systems and fuel pipes can be found in aerospace petroleum energy marine engineering and so on the complex dynamic behaviors of the pipe caused by the fluid flow and the external excitations affect

vibration control suppression and isolation of fluid conveying pipes in the studies mentioned above the euler bernoulli beam theory is used to model the fluid conveying pipe the shear deformation and sectional moment of inertia cannot be ignored in some cases then the timoshenko beam theory was adopted huang 1974 is the first to establish a fluid conveying pipe model according to timoshenko beam theory païdoussis and laithier 1976 first analyzed the dynamics of timoshenko fluid conveying pipe and compared it with euler bernoulli pipe in païdoussis 1986 other work the necessity of timoshenko beam theory to describe the dynamics of short fluid conveying pipes was manifested the critical flow velocity in damped and undamped cases was studied by pramila et al 1991 lin and tsai 1997 and zhang et al 2001 analyzed the nonlinear vibration dynamics li et al 2011 explored the free vibration dynamics the effect of aspect ratio on the natural frequency and critical flow velocity is presented by gu et al 2016 and the results were compared with the euler bernoulli fluid conveying pipe the expressions for critical velocity and non trivial static equilibrium configurations are derived by tan et al 2018 these references mentioned above all show that the natural frequencies obtained by the euler bernoulli pipe model are larger and the vibration response is smaller nevertheless in the supercritical speed range the natural frequency of pipe vibration obtained by the euler bernoulli model may be smaller tan et al 2019 therefore in the supercritical velocity range it is necessary to further explore the difference between the timoshenko model and the euler bernoulli model in order to reveal why the vibration of high speed pipes is more severe in this work forced vibration characteristics of a timoshenko pipe conveying supercritical fluid are investigated first by using an approximate analytic method and verified by two numerical methods the research in this paper shows that in the supercritical speed range the forced vibration of the pipe shows more super harmonic resonance regions than in the subcritical regime moreover in the vicinity of the critical speed the vibration of the pipe is more severe the influence of system parameters especially flow velocity and external excitation on the dynamic response is estimated the influence of flow velocity and external excitation on the difference of the dynamics between the timoshenko pipe model and euler bernoulli pipe model is analyzed 2 mathematical model considering a uniform viscoelastic pipe with

obtained and the effects of the system parameters are discussed the difference between the timoshenko pipe model and euler bernoulli pipe model is presented furthermore the influence of the flow velocity and external excitation on the difference has been revealed in the following studies the physical parameters are selected as follows the pipe length l is 0 22 m the outer diameter is 0 02 m the pipe thickness is 0 001 m young s modulus e 896 mpa initial axial force p 0 100 n the value of poisson s ratio is taken as 0 41 the density of the pipe is 920 kg m3 the density of the fluid is 1000 kg m3 p is selected as the standard atmospheric pressure the convergence of the galerkin truncation method is discussed by calculating the natural frequencies of the pipe conveying supercritical fluid ding et al 2017 the results in the fig 2 demonstrated that the first two natural frequencies which calculated by the 4 term and 6 term galerkin truncation method match well with the increasing of flow velocity it can be deemed that the 4 term galerkin truncation method reaches the convergence in the subsequent investigation the galerkin truncation term m is set as 4 since the existence of square and cubic nonlinear terms in the governing equations the harmonic term n is set as 3 then by applying the newton raphson method the approximate analytical solutions of the governing equations are obtained the stability of the steady state solution is judged by the above stability analysis method fig 3 presented approximate analytical and numerical steady state responses of the forced vibration for the timoshenko pipe conveying supercritical fluid the solid line and the hollow circle denote stable solutions and unstable solutions respectively the solid dot stands for numerical results which calculated by combining the galerkin method and runge kutta method the hollow rectangular represents the numerical results calculated directly by the fdm fig 3 indicates the validity and correctness of the approximate analytic method 4 1 influences of some parameters the effects of the shear deformation coefficient rotational inertia coefficient nonlinear coefficient stiffness coefficient flow velocity and external excitation on the steady state amplitude frequency response of the timoshenko pipe conveying supercritical fluid are examined fig 4 and fig 5 depicts the effect of the shear deformation coefficient and the rotational inertia coefficient respectively the curves in fig 4 depict a larger shear deformation results in a smaller resonance point but a larger resonance amplitude the results in fig 5 manifest the rotational inertia coefficient slightly varies the amplitude frequency curves fig 6 and fig 7 presents the influence of the nonlinear coefficient and the stiffness coefficient respectively as seen the resonance point is not moved but the resonance amplitude changed significantly by the nonlinear coefficient however the both are affected by the stiffness coefficient notably fig 8 describes the influence of the subcritical and supercritical flow velocity obviously the flow velocity near the critical value is more prone to large amplitude resonance the results in fig 8 a show the larger supercritical flow velocity diminishes the resonance amplitude however the larger subcritical flow velocity increases the resonance amplitude in the fig 8 b in short the flow velocity in the two velocity regimes has completely opposite effect on the amplitude frequency response fig 9 presents the influence of the external excitation in the supercritical regime fig 10 shows the effect of the excitation in the subcritical regime the curves in figs 9 a and fig 10 a indicate that the excitation affects dramatically the primary resonance responses in any velocity domain the results in fig 9 b demonstrate a larger excitation can arouse second order and even third order super harmonic resonance response in the supercritical regime however only third order super harmonic resonance response evoked in the subcritical regime in the fig 10 b 4 2 comparison of two pipe models in this section comparison of the dynamic resonance between the timoshenko pipe model and euler bernoulli pipe model is revealed the governing nonlinear equation of forced vibration of the euler bernoulli pipe can degenerate from eq 13 as 31 w t t 2 γ

length of pipe is 0 4 m and the ratio of the cross section to the length is 1 5e 4 is calculated usually the vibration analysis of such a pipe may be carried out using the euler bernoulli model however in this section the effect of high flow velocity on the nonlinear forced vibration is discussed based on the timoshenko and euler bernoulli pipe models fig 11 and fig 12 depict the primary resonance responses of the two pipe models at different supercritical and subcritical flow velocity respectively the results show an interesting phenomenon that the maximal resonance amplitude of the timoshenko pipe is always larger than that of the euler bernoulli pipe in the subcritical regime however always smaller in the supercritical regime fig 13 a and fig 13 b illustrates the relative error varying with the subcritical and supercritical flow velocity respectively the relative error is defined as the maximal resonance amplitude of the euler bernoulli pipe minus that of the timoshenko pipe and then divided by the latter the positive and negative of the relative error indicates the resonance amplitude of the two models is inconsistent in the two velocity domains interestingly the relative error increases monotonically in the subcritical regime but varies nonmonotonically in the supercritical regime 4 2 2 super harmonic resonance the influence of the external excitation on the super harmonic resonance responses of the two pipe models in the supercritical regime is presented in fig 14 the results indicate the second order super harmonic resonance is larger than the third order super harmonic resonance and the former is more easily aroused moreover in the supercritical regime the super harmonic resonance amplitude of the euler bernoulli pipe is always larger than that of the timoshenko pipe fig 15 a and fig 15 b show the relative error of the third order and the second order super harmonic resonance varying with the external excitation in the supercritical regime respectively it can be noted that for larger external excitations both of the relative errors increase rapidly and exceed 10 easily fig 16 depicts the effect of the external excitation on the subcritical super harmonic resonance responses of the two pipe models compared with the fig 14 it can be found that only third order super harmonic resonance response is aroused furthermore in the subcritical regime the amplitude of the super harmonic resonance response of the timoshenko pipe is larger fig 17 show the relative error of super harmonic resonance varying with the external excitation in the subcritical regime the curve in the fig 17 reflects that the difference between the timoshenko pipe and euler bernoulli pipe increases with the external excitation 5 conclusions the primary and super harmonic resonances of a timoshenko fluid conveying pipe in the supercritical regime were obtained by the harmonic balance method the correctness of the approximate analytical solution was verified by finite difference method parameter analysis and comparison between the timoshenko pipe and euler bernoulli pipe were discussed finally the following conclusions can be drawn the subcritical and supercritical flow velocity has different effects on the primary resonance amplitude moreover because in the area near the critical speed the fundamental frequency of the pipe is close to zero therefore the vibration amplitude of the pipe will be bigger therefore vibrations are most severe when approaching critical flow speed only third order super harmonic resonance can be evoked in the subcritical regime while second order and third order super harmonic resonance can both be aroused in the supercritical regime therefore in the supercritical speed range the resonance zone of the pipe is more the difference of the primary resonance of the two pipe models varies with supercritical flow velocity non monotonously moreover in the subcritical regime the resonance amplitude of the timoshenko pipe may be larger than that of the euler bernoulli pipe it s interesting because in the supercritical regime the resonance amplitude of timoshenko pipe is always smaller in brief this paper reveals the reason why the vibration of the fluid conveying pipe can be more severe in the supercritical high speed range besides the high flow velocity and the large external excitation will widen the difference between the two pipe models and make timoshenko pipe model more necessary credit authorship contribution statement xia tan investigation writing original draft hu

21946,high speed flow pipes suffer from severe vibration problems when the fluid velocity is higher than the critical value the straight equilibrium configuration of the pipe will lose stability what follows is the supercritical vibration of the pipe near the non trivial static equilibrium configuration this paper attempts to reveal multiple resonance responses of forced vibration of pipes in the supercritical regime based on timoshenko beam theory the nonlinear coupled partial differential equations are deduced the non trivial static equilibrium configuration causes the parameters to vary with space variable the approximate responses of the pipe are obtained and verified numerically the results show that the flow velocity near the critical value is more prone to cause severe vibration unlike in the subcritical regime there are third order super harmonic resonance and second order super harmonic resonance in the supercritical regime so there are more resonance areas in the supercritical regime high flow velocity or large external excitation can aggravate the difference between the euler bernoulli model and the timoshenko model and the relative error of two models varies non monotonically even for slender pipes the difference between the two models is still very clear therefore the timoshenko model is more necessary to analyze the vibration of the high speed pipe

vibration control suppression and isolation of fluid conveying pipes in the studies mentioned above the euler bernoulli beam theory is used to model the fluid conveying pipe the shear deformation and sectional moment of inertia cannot be ignored in some cases then the timoshenko beam theory was adopted huang 1974 is the first to establish a fluid conveying pipe model according to timoshenko beam theory païdoussis and laithier 1976 first analyzed the dynamics of timoshenko fluid conveying pipe and compared it with euler bernoulli pipe in païdoussis 1986 other work the necessity of timoshenko beam theory to describe the dynamics of short fluid conveying pipes was manifested the critical flow velocity in damped and undamped cases was studied by pramila et al 1991 lin and tsai 1997 and zhang et al 2001 analyzed the nonlinear vibration dynamics li et al 2011 explored the free vibration dynamics the effect of aspect ratio on the natural frequency and critical flow velocity is presented by gu et al 2016 and the results were compared with the euler bernoulli fluid conveying pipe the expressions for critical velocity and non trivial static equilibrium configurations are derived by tan et al 2018 these references mentioned above all show that the natural frequencies obtained by the euler bernoulli pipe model are larger and the vibration response is smaller nevertheless in the supercritical speed range the natural frequency of pipe vibration obtained by the euler bernoulli model may be smaller tan et al 2019 therefore in the supercritical velocity range it is necessary to further explore the difference between the timoshenko model and the euler bernoulli model in order to reveal why the vibration of high speed pipes is more severe in this work forced vibration characteristics of a timoshenko pipe conveying supercritical fluid are investigated first by using an approximate analytic method and verified by two numerical methods the research in this paper shows that in the supercritical speed range the forced vibration of the pipe shows more super harmonic resonance regions than in the subcritical regime moreover in the vicinity of the critical speed the vibration of the pipe is more severe the influence of system parameters especially flow velocity and external excitation on the dynamic response is estimated the influence of flow velocity and external excitation on the difference of the dynamics between the timoshenko pipe model and euler bernoulli pipe model is analyzed 2 mathematical model considering a uniform viscoelastic pipe with

1000 kg m3 p is selected as the standard atmospheric pressure the convergence of the galerkin truncation method is discussed by calculating the natural frequencies of the pipe conveying supercritical fluid ding et al 2017 the results in the fig 2 demonstrated that the first two natural frequencies which calculated by the 4 term and 6 term galerkin truncation method match well with the increasing of flow velocity it can be deemed that the 4 term galerkin truncation method reaches the convergence in the subsequent investigation the galerkin truncation term m is set as 4 since the existence of square and cubic nonlinear terms in the governing equations the harmonic term n is set as 3 then by applying the newton raphson method the approximate analytical solutions of the governing equations are obtained the stability of the steady state solution is judged by the above stability analysis method fig 3 presented approximate analytical and numerical steady state responses of the forced

coefficient flow velocity and external excitation on the steady state amplitude frequency response of the timoshenko pipe conveying supercritical fluid are examined fig 4 and fig 5 depicts the effect of the shear deformation coefficient and the rotational inertia coefficient respectively the curves in fig 4 depict a larger shear deformation results in a smaller resonance point but a larger resonance amplitude the results in fig 5 manifest the rotational inertia coefficient slightly varies the amplitude frequency curves fig 6 and fig 7 presents the influence of the nonlinear coefficient and the stiffness coefficient respectively as seen the resonance point is not moved but the resonance amplitude changed significantly by the nonlinear coefficient however the both are affected by the stiffness coefficient notably fig 8 describes the influence of the subcritical and supercritical flow velocity obviously the flow velocity near the critical value is more prone to large amplitude resonance the results in fig 8 a show the larger supercritical flow velocity diminishes the resonance amplitude however the larger subcritical flow velocity increases the resonance amplitude in the fig 8 b in short the flow velocity in the two velocity regimes has completely opposite effect on the amplitude frequency response fig 9 presents the influence of the external excitation in the supercritical regime fig 10 shows the effect of the excitation in the subcritical regime the curves in figs 9 a and fig 10 a indicate that the excitation affects dramatically the primary resonance responses in any velocity domain the results in fig 9 b demonstrate a larger excitation can arouse second order and even third order super harmonic resonance response in the supercritical regime however only third order super harmonic resonance response evoked in the subcritical regime in the fig 10 b 4 2 comparison of two pipe models in this section comparison of the dynamic resonance between the timoshenko pipe model and euler bernoulli pipe model is revealed the governing nonlinear equation of forced vibration of the euler bernoulli pipe can degenerate from eq 13 as 31 w t t 2 γ m r w x t γ 2 k f w x x w x x w ˆ x x 2 k n 2 0 1 w x 2 2 w x w ˆ x d x w x x 2 k n 2 0 1 w ˆ x 2 d x w x x x x α w x x x x t b cos ω t the corresponding boundary conditions are 32 w 0 1 0 w x x 0 1 0 the non trivial static equilibrium configuration of euler bernoulli fluid conveying pipe is 33 w ˆ x a e sin π x a e 2 π k n γ 2 k f π 2 4 2 1 primary resonance another numerical example which the length of pipe is 0 4 m and the ratio of the cross section to the length is 1 5e 4 is calculated usually the vibration analysis of such a pipe may be carried out using the euler bernoulli model however in this section the effect of high flow velocity on the nonlinear forced vibration is discussed based on the timoshenko and euler bernoulli pipe models fig 11 and fig 12 depict the primary resonance responses of the two pipe models at different supercritical and subcritical flow velocity respectively the results show an interesting phenomenon that the maximal resonance amplitude of the timoshenko pipe is always larger than that of the euler bernoulli pipe in the subcritical regime however always smaller in the supercritical regime fig 13 a and fig 13 b illustrates the relative error varying with the subcritical and supercritical flow velocity respectively the relative error is defined as the maximal resonance amplitude of the euler bernoulli pipe minus that of the timoshenko pipe and then divided by the latter the positive and negative of the relative error indicates the resonance amplitude of the two models is inconsistent in the two velocity domains interestingly the relative error increases monotonically in the subcritical regime but varies nonmonotonically in the supercritical regime 4 2 2 super harmonic resonance the influence of the external excitation on the super harmonic resonance responses of the two pipe models in the supercritical regime is presented in fig 14 the results indicate the second order super harmonic resonance is larger than the third order super harmonic resonance and the former is more easily aroused moreover in the supercritical regime the super harmonic resonance amplitude of the euler bernoulli pipe is always larger than that of the timoshenko pipe fig 15 a and fig 15 b show the relative error of the third order and the second order super harmonic resonance varying with the external excitation in the supercritical regime respectively it can be noted that for larger external excitations both of the relative errors increase rapidly and exceed 10 easily fig 16 depicts the effect of the external excitation on the subcritical super harmonic resonance responses of the two pipe models compared with the fig 14 it can be found that only third order super harmonic resonance response is aroused furthermore in the subcritical regime the amplitude of the super harmonic resonance response of the timoshenko pipe is larger fig 17 show the relative error of super harmonic resonance varying with the external excitation in the subcritical regime the curve in the fig 17 reflects that the difference between the timoshenko pipe and euler bernoulli pipe increases with the external excitation 5 conclusions the primary and super harmonic resonances of a timoshenko fluid conveying pipe in the supercritical regime were obtained by the harmonic balance method the correctness of the approximate analytical solution was verified by finite difference method parameter analysis and comparison between the timoshenko pipe and euler bernoulli pipe were discussed finally the following conclusions can be drawn the subcritical and supercritical flow velocity has different effects on the primary resonance amplitude moreover because in the area near the critical speed the fundamental frequency of the pipe is close to zero therefore the vibration amplitude of the pipe will be bigger therefore vibrations are most severe when approaching critical flow speed only third order super harmonic resonance can be evoked in the subcritical regime while second order and third order super harmonic resonance can both be aroused in the supercritical regime therefore in the supercritical speed range the resonance zone of the pipe is more the difference of the primary resonance of the two pipe models varies with supercritical flow velocity non monotonously moreover in the subcritical regime the resonance amplitude of the timoshenko pipe may be larger than that of the euler bernoulli pipe it s interesting because in the supercritical regime the resonance amplitude of timoshenko pipe is always smaller in brief this paper reveals the reason why the vibration of the fluid conveying pipe can be more severe in the supercritical high speed range besides the high flow velocity and the large external excitation will widen the difference between the two pipe models and make timoshenko pipe model more necessary credit authorship contribution statement xia tan investigation writing original draft hu

21947,recent global warming has made it possible to exploit and utilize resources in the arctic northwest passage however the harsh natural environment in this sea area poses a major threat to safety during navigation although this passage is extensive the natural environmental state of few key nodes affect the navigability of the entire passage in this paper we describe dynamic assessment of natural environmental risks of key nodes in the arctic northwest passage using dynamic bayesian network dbn specifically index selection and data processing determination of key navigation nodes calculation of evidence based reasoning and verification of dbn model are discussed results show that the dbn model effectively handles uncertainty of information and generates highly accurate inference results in addition it integrates historical information in the reasoning process enables accumulation of information reduces the influence of data errors on the final result and makes the result closer to the real value overall this model provides an important reference for judging the comprehensive risks of natural environment at key nodes keywords arctic northwest passage key node dynamic bayesian network dynamic evaluation 1 introduction the arctic northwest passage generally refers to a passage traversing the beaufort sea in northern alaska the canadian arctic archipelago waters eastern davis strait and baffin bay and finally the pacific and atlantic oceans due to its unique geographical location it can be predicted that this passage will play a vital role in the shipping industry in fact according to borgerson 2008 it has shortened the voyage from seattle to rotterdam by 2000 n miles saving 25 due to such advantages this passage has attracted the attention of many countries in 2008 mv camilla desgagnés set off from montreal canada and became the first merchant ship to use the passage in 2014 the nunavik ice breaking bulk carrier set out from disepchen bay and traveled alone through the entire northwest passage to reach ying kou port in china traditionally the panama canal has been the only trade route between china and north america these successful attempts indicate a more economical passage for trade between china and north america stephens 2016 through the passage trade voyages between china and north america have been shortened by 40 emissions reduced by 1300 tons resulting in considerable savings li 2016 in september 2017 china s snow dragon polar scientific research vessel crossed the northwest passage for the first time directly promoting china s commercial use of the arctic passage opening of this channel not only provides an additional navigation option but also enables change of economic strategic status for countries along the route the northwest passage has many advantages compared to the traditional passage these include a short channel distance low shipping costs simple geopolitics and low risk of pirate attacks zou and huang 2016 however because it is located in a high latitude region the channel also faces disadvantages such as imperfect infrastructure a fragile ecological environment as well as poor emergency response and rescue capabilities additionally it is frozen for most of the year and cannot therefore be efficiently utilized stephens 2016 research on global warming in recent years shows that the arctic region is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world according to the current trends in climate change the area around the arctic sea will be completely ice free as early as the summer of 2050 and all year round by 2100 this means that the navigation period of this passage will be greatly prolonged and its navigable conditions significantly improved making it possible to exploit polar resources sou and flato 2009 khon et al 2010 dan et al 2015 the first requirement for whether a passage can be opened and accepted by everyone is safety during navigation it has therefore become increasingly necessary to perform safety risk analysis of the arctic northwest passage currently there are two kinds of risk assessments for arctic shipping lanes the first one analyzes risk causing mechanisms of each influencing factor here these factors are organically integrated to obtain an intuitive risk state assessment for selecting and adjusting a navigation route the other builds a risk assessment model for traffic accidents in arctic navigation channels specifically maritime accidents are taken as the research object and used to estimate risks of accident scenarios and associated consultations this information is further used to support ship operation decisions thereby minimizing navigation and operation risks in arctic waters the first type of risk assessment has generated the following developments pharand 2007 examined possible disputes over the right of transit passage following the opening of the northwest passage and predicted that a gradual opening of the passage would increase social and political risks the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process fahp approach and grey fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method were subsequently used to identify and quantify navigation risks of the arctic channel based on expert experience li et al 2012 sahin and kum 2015 in addition fu et al 2016 used the bayesian belief networks bbn to develop a causal probabilistic model that predicts the probability of a ship getting stuck in ice of the arctic waters in this causal model a set of input parameters such as hydro meteorological conditions air temperature ice concentration ice thickness sea temperature wave height and wind speed along the analyzed route were considered the second type of risk assessment has also generated numerous developments to achieve better predictability for instance kum and sahin 2015 educed a fault tree ft model for estimating the probability of failure resulting from combinations of faults to analyze navigation related accidents and their causes in the arctic from 1993 to 2011 it must be pointed out here that this model borrows ferdous s theoretical framework and uses fuzzy approach with ft technique to reduce the ambiguity and imprecision arising out of subjectivity of the data ferdous et al 2009 however the ft model mainly analyzes the cause of the accident in order to carry out a detailed investigation from the basic cause to the final result a bow tie bt diagram model has been applied which is a combination of the fault and event tree in this model the event tree et is a mature risk analysis technique used to assess the likelihood of an accident huang et al 2001 but without addressing the incompleteness and inaccuracy in the available data and the inflexibility to absorb new knowledge evidence the credibility of bt and subsequent risk analysis remains a major issue in order to solve the above problems ferdous et al 2013 used fuzzy sets and evidence theory to characterize the uncertainty associated with expert knowledge while merging the knowledge of multiple experts and updating existing knowledge with new evidence effectively increasing the credibility of quantitative assessment models based on this framework have also been applied in arctic shipping and accident for example abbassi et al 2017 used the bt relationship to represent causes of accidents their consequences and the probability of occurrence during navigation in arctic waters however this model is incapable of handling accident scenarios where redundant common cause or dependent failures occur khakzad et al 2011 furthermore it does not use real time information to update probabilities of failures in primary events and safety barriers khan et al 2014 to overcome these limitations and dynamically assess transportation risks the bayesian network bn was proposed for modeling accidents khan et al 2014 proposed a causality based approach using bn to estimate the probability of maritime accidents and their related consequences similarly afenyo et al 2017 used bn to analyze the collision scenarios between the ship and the arctic iceberg the use of bayesian network offers analysts the opportunity to model interdependencies among the casual factors which is not possible in conventional methods like the ft in addition baksh et al 2018 proposed a new risk model in which bn is applied to the northern sea route nsr to investigate the possibility of marine accidents including collision foundering and grounding this model considers different operational and environmental factors that affect shipping operations with their base values prior values estimated using historical data and expert judgments experimental results obtained from this model identify ice effect as the dominant factor in accidents zhang 2014 concluded that bns could combine objective data with subjective knowledge to handle these uncertainties the discussion above show that bn is an effective approach for modeling maritime risks however some limitations in standard bn representation make it difficult to learn construct update infer and reason complex models khan et al 2018 to overcome these shortcomings object oriented bayesian network oobn is proposed for modeling and analyzing accidents this model particularly predicts the probability of ship ice collision considering navigational operating and human factors khan et al 2018 in order to deal with the threat of ship oil spill to the ecologically fragile arctic waterway afenyo et al 2019 also applied the oobn model to study oil spill mitigative measures this model overcomes the complexity lack of data and uncertainties in an oil spill and response modeling scenario for arctic shipping accident occurrence so far arctic channel risk assessment modeling cannot adequately visualize waterway risks through the fusion of risk causing factors analysis of accidents is developing towards quantification bt model dynamics bn model and modularization oobn model numerous factors affect the safety of ship navigation these include technical faults including ship navigational system states and operational system states environmental conditions such as ice and weather states social factors including local regulations pirates and economic disputes human error rothblum 2000 bowditch 2002 advisory 2009 canadian coast guard 2012 advisory 2014 sahin and kum 2015 environment canada 2016 khan et al 2018 however quantitative characterization cannot be currently directly performed due to a high degree of uncertainty in internal causes such as technical failures of ships and human caused operational errors this article therefore focuses on analysis and quantification of risks in the environmental conditions module by consulting several literatures and analyzing the unique climate and geographical location of the arctic region we will discuss the characteristics of the natural environment of the northwest passage from two aspects meteorological environment and hydrological environment there are many routes in the northwest passage generally speaking only the natural environment of some key nodes influence the overall navigability of the passage fu 2012 we evaluate natural environmental conditions in several key sea areas of the northwest passage through reviewing the past researches we integrate various risk factors to obtain intuitive risk assessment the common theoretical evaluation methods currently in use include ahp fahp and bn due to the strong subjectivity of ahp and fuzzy evaluation it is difficult to express and deal with uncertain information in addition these methods are unable to use the accident precursor information to revise the risk profile kalantarnia 2009 in order to overcome this shortcoming kalantarnia 2009 introduced the concept of dynamic risk assessment and used bayesian theory to update the likelihood of the event occurrence and also failure probability of the safety system in case studies the importance of learning and prediction tools in risk assessment is demonstrated by comparison with traditional methods bn is built under the framework of bayesian theory so it also overcomes the deficiencies of ahp and fahp in risk assessment to a certain extent bn can calculate the probability of unknown parameters as well as update that of known variables using conditional probability kjaerulff 1995 but it is limited in dealing with dynamic time series information in fact the general bn is static for example the joint probability distribution is usually a representation of a fixed point or an interval of time mcnaught and zagorecki 2010 furthermore bn does not consider the correlation and mutual supplement of the information before and after time so it cannot realize dynamic evaluation dynamic bayesian network dbn describes the evolution of joint probability distribution over time and thus extends the bn discrete time modeling proposed by dean and kanazawa 1989 represents progression of time in the dbn in dbn arcs links nodes from previous time slice to that of the next time slice to represent temporal dependencies among them montani et al 2005 included temporal aspects to perform reliability analysis to demonstrate capabilities of dbn in a dependability analysis therefore application of dbn would improve flexibility during risk analysis as a new intelligent knowledge expression and reasoning tool dbn has strong advantages when dealing with uncertain expression of time series information and reasoning problems related to complex structures its application in dynamic evaluation and prediction is expected to set the trend for future development currently few studies have investigated the used of dbn for intelligent modeling the focus has been on assessing safety of production and transportation processes however application of this tool for environmental risk assessment in the arctic sea has not been tested the available documents only allow preliminary assessment modeling and perform analysis based on dbn khakzad et al 2012 pauplin and jiang 2012 barua et al 2016 li et al 2018 zeng and zio 2018 however in these studies manual determination of network structure and parameters was completely based on expert knowledge and not objective data analysis and therefore lacks the process of automatically learning node parameters from actual data which is highly subjective based on the above correlation analysis this paper relies on quantification dynamics and modularization concepts we begin with the natural environment module target key nodes on the passage and relies on the theory of dbn on the basis of analysis of risk factors of marine environment in key sea areas of the northwest passage establishment of network structure learning of node parameters and reasoning calculation a dbn model for assessing the natural environment in the arctic is established this is based on expert knowledge and objective data combines prior information and updated evidence information it also fully considers the time effect of information accumulation to achieve quantitative dynamic and modular risk assessment the rest of the paper is structured as follows section 1 introduces the risk causing mechanism data sources normalization scheme and interannual distribution characteristics of the risk causing factors selected in this paper a number of key nodes on the northwest passage are identified in section 2 while section 3 generates discretized sample data sets a case study is presented in section 4 to describe the application of the method the accuracy and validity of the dbn risk assessment model are verified in section 5 2 index selection and data source we utilize the unique climate and geographical location of the northwest passage to identify causes of risks in natural environment meteorological and hydrological environment and define its risk bearing body and related consequences the effect of various risk causing factors is shown in table 1 2 1 a risk indicator system for natural environment safety according to the analysis described above ships and personnel sailing in the northwest passage were used as risk carriers to identify the main risk factors affecting the meteorological and hydrological environment the selected factors are shown in table 2 2 2 discriminating layer meaning risk mechanism data source and quantitative method the indicators are defined and quantified to ensure a strong intuitive reflection of their attributes and characteristics based on objective facts and predecessors bai et al 2009 lu 2012 this section redefines and quantifies the five indicators in the previous section 2 2 1 gale risk index d1 definition gale risk index refers to the degree of threat from gale weather to vessels in the target area and is mainly reflected by the wind speed risk mechanism in case of gale it is easy encounter accidents such as yaw anchoring and stranding of the ship when sailing in the polar regions the wind also blows ice floes posing a potential threat to the ship data sources and description wind speed is extracted from the era high precision monthly average reanalysis dataset from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf which records worldwide meridional and zonal wind speeds to obtain the latest natural environmental risk characteristics of the northwest passage monthly average data from 2005 to 2016 is selected as the time series quantification formula 1 d 1 w 2 w min 2 w 10 8 1 w 10 8 according to energy science the intensity of strong winds depends on wind speed in formula 1 w denotes the original value of wind speed in the evaluation unit while w min is the lowest standard value of the strong wind with a value of 10 8 m s yang et al 2013 2 2 2 visibility risk index d2 definition visibility risk index refers to the extent to which visibility in a target area threatens the safety of vessel in the sea the larger the indicator value the greater the risk risk mechanism in meteorology visibility refers to the maximum horizontal distance that can be seen by normal eyes when sailing in the arctic factors that affect visibility mainly include sea fog snow blowing hail etc among these fog is the most important factor during low visibility conditions it is difficult to identify obstacles which may lead to collision between ships and ice july and august is the best time for ships to navigate owing to the melting of sea ice however frequent advection fog compromises the safety of ships data sources and brief introduction the monthly average visibility data from 2005 to 2016 are obtained based on bp neural network regression inversion algorithm shan et al 2019 the scheme uses the relevant factors such as aerosol relative humidity precipitation etc that affect visibility to carry out visibility inversion by constructing bp network and corrects the deviation by combining the ocean visibility data from the stations released by the national climate data centre of the united states quantification formula 2 d 2 1 v v min v max v min in the formula v is the original visibility value of the evaluation unit while v min and v max are minimum and maximum visibility values in the study sample area respectively 2 2 3 sea ice thickness risk index d3 definition sea ice thickness hazard index refers to the threat level posed by thickness of sea ice to the shipping vessel in a target area risk mechanism larger sea ice thickness indicates thicker ice based on this it will bring great challenges to the ship s ability to break ice increase the possibility of the ship being stuck which compromises rescue efforts in the event of ship accident data sources and brief introduction sea ice thickness data are generated from the monthly averages in the output of the pan arctic ice ocean modeling and assistance system piomas sea ice model released by the university of washington in the u s quantification formula 3 d 3 k k min k max k min in the formula k is the original value of sea ice thickness of the evaluation unit while k min and k max are the minimum and maximum values of the sea ice thickness in the study sample area respectively 2 2 4 sea ice density risk index d4 definition sea ice density risk index refers to the degree of threat of sea ice to shipping vessels in a target area the higher the concentration of sea ice the greater the risk risk mechanism the higher the concentration of sea ice the more ice there is on the sea surface this risk index d4 tests the continuous ability of ships to break ice and further increases the probability of formation of floating ice iceberg which endangers the safety of ships data source and brief introduction sea ice density is extracted from the era high precision monthly average reanalysis dataset monthly average data from 2005 to 2016 is selected as the time series quantification formula 4 d 4 i i min i max i min in the formula i denotes the original value of sea ice density of the evaluation unit while i min and i max are minimum and maximum values of sea ice density in the study sample area respectively 2 2 5 sea temperature risk index d5 definition low temperature risk index refers to the degree of threat to shipping vessels caused by low sea surface temperatures in a target area risk mechanism when sailing in the arctic region low temperature influences ships in the following aspects firstly low temperature causes the sea surface to freeze and form an ice layer which impairs ship navigation secondly when the ship is sailing waves rain and snow cause ice accretion when the temperature is relatively low thereby indirectly affecting its navigation lastly low temperature decreases the living conditions of the crew inconveniencing their normal life and work this inevitably affects operation of the ship xie 2014 data sources and brief introduction sea surface temperature is extracted from the era high precision monthly average reanalysis dataset monthly average data from 2005 to 2016 is selected as the time series quantification formula 5 d 5 0 t 0 c t t min 0 t min t 0 c in the formula t denotes the original value of sea surface temperature sst while t min is minimum value of sst in the study sample area respectively 2 3 spatial distribution characteristics of climatic state of each index in an ideal navigation period in this paper northwest passage and its surrounding waters are taken as the target area spanning from 60 w to 135 w 66 n 77 n coordinates according to previous research july september is the ideal navigation period in this passage howell et al 2009 therefore we calculate the multi year 2005 2016 climatic average value of each index from july to september based on this spatial distribution of the climate natural indicators in the time period when the passage is most likely to be opened are analyzed see fig 1 based on sea ice density ice in the northwest passage covers the low east and high west regions the risk of busia bay and the mcclintock strait is higher lower in baffin bay in terms of sea ice thickness it is evident that the waterway is generally in a low risk state while the channel between victoria island and prince of wales in high risk state based on temperature the findings show that the risk in some sea areas such as the mcclintock strait is high moreover the wind speed poses medium to low risk in the northwest passage but high risk in the mcclintock strait and busia bay in terms of visibility the northwest passage is generally at medium to low risk but the relative risk increases at high latitude regions 3 determination of key nodes in the northwest passage as can be seen from the above the status of influence factors varies from place to place in the northwest passage in actual navigation navigation routes are usually determined according to the specific application conditions if the risk assessment is carried out for the entire northwest passage the efficiency decreases as well as the significance several key nodes in these channels cannot be avoided in actual navigation its natural environment is of great significance for navigation if the key sea areas are not navigable the entire route basically cannot be traversed in this section we will focus on the selection of key nodes in the general route of the northwest passage 3 1 determination of key sea areas in the northwest passage although the global views on the general route of the northwest passage are similar this is not the case for the specific route of the northwest passage analysis of different aspects of this passage has identified 7 main routes namely north northwest passage road nnpr prince of wales strait pws peel strait ps peel strait ps adjustment route prince regent inlet pri prince regent inlet pri adjustment route 1 and prince regent inlet pri adjustment route 2 pharand 2007 from historical studies fu 2012 jie et al 2010 the opening degree of the northwest passage is largest in august and september in a given year while the number of navigable sea areas in october and november have declined sharply in recent years making it almost impassable on average all waters except barrow strait lancaster sound and the northern waters of victoria strait open in august these waters partially open in mid september therefore we identify three key sea areas that affect or determine whether the northwest passage of the arctic is navigable i e the ba lan key area the ba mai mei key area and the northern sea area of the victoria strait among them ba lan is located at the eastern exit of the northwest passage which is the preferred exit for all routes except route 7 since the condition of routes along route 7 are not favorable we infer that ba lan key area is the only area that affects the navigability of the entire northwest passage fu 2012 a key advantage of this area is that it receives the west greenland warm current jie et al 2010 although it is difficult to navigate in august the sea area is navigable in september when sea ice extent is at minimum there is almost no ice in the ba lan key area thus the ba lan key area 73 5 n 74 5 n 90 w 75 w is finally chosen as the research focus the changes of natural environment risks in this sea area are determined using real time data 3 2 determination of key nodes based on recommendations in the book called arctic navigation guide northwest passage 2015 we identified several points maritime administration of the people s republic of china 2016 by considering several factors such as hydrometeorology sea ice rescue and logistics services obstruction of navigation and prohibition of navigation as shown in table 3 and fig 2 thus we explore the selected key nodes in key sea areas of the northwest passage we use no 1 node in the key sea area of ba lan as an example to study the dynamic changes in the natural environment risks in these sea areas using real time data 4 generation of target node data target node data i e the comprehensive risk value of natural environment cannot be directly obtained through observation instead it is obtained through calculation considering the limited operational experience and lack of historical accident information of the arctic region the value or probability distribution of the target node was previously generated randomly with markov chain monte carlo framework abbassi et al 2017 or assigned based on experience khan et al 2014 herein the risk factors are linearly fused to reduce the error this section attempts to generate a complete sample set containing target node data in three steps 4 1 discretization of index data for computational reasons the bn is generally restricted to variables with discrete states straub 2005 but the data of the selected indexes are continuous thus it is necessary to discretize the continuous indexes and determine the grade of each index before learning the structure of bn that is to determine the status of network nodes given natural index data in this paper has already normalized the traditional discrete method interval equal interval partition method is adopted in this paper the specific partition methods are shown in table 4 the continuous indexes are divided into discrete grades to generate discrete data sets 4 2 subjective and objective combination determination of the weight value considering that changes in index elements varies with time and entropy weight method determines the weight based on the variation degree of index values which uses the difference between the amount of information of each indicator data to determine the weight thereby reducing the interference of human subjective judgments on the weight liu et al 2011 therefore we employ the entropy weight method to determine the weight in this paper however the pure objective weight determination methods are also limited in some ways if the subjective and objective methods are combined this will avoid excessive reliance on expert knowledge and experience and minimize the mismatch between the data information and the actual cognitive law therefore we adopt a subjective method with wide application scope and good effect g1 huang et al 2008 jing et al 2013 the final weight value is obtained from the weighted sum of the weights determined by the two methods with the subjective and objective methods yielding 0 4 and 0 6 respectively the target node data can be obtained by weighting and summing the data of each observation node the final combined weight values determined by subjective and objective methods are shown in table 5 the calculation results show that the weights of the no 1 point in the key area of ba lan are sea ice thickness d3 sea surface temperature d5 wind intensity d1 sea ice concentration index d4 and low visibility d2 it can be seen that sea ice especially its thickness is still the most important factor hindering further opening of the channel the thickness of sea ice is difficult to measure with ordinary equipment resulting in insufficient quality data when calculating the weight of low visibility index the results obtained by entropy weight method and the g1 method are significantly different the entropy weight method is based on the difference of the amount of information in the data itself due to the scarcity of data and the characteristics of the monthly average data in the northwest passage the results of the entropy weight method have a certain deviation historical research showed that the importance of this indicator was undeniable khan et al 2018 therefore the existence of the g1 method weakens the problem of the mismatch between the results of the entropy method and the objective situation the final result of the weights is consistent with the actual situation of the natural environment elements 4 3 target node data generated by index fusion index fusion is a component of the risk assessment model in this paper the normalized index data and corresponding index weights are fused by weighted synthesis method the fusion formula is as follows 6 risk i 1 n w i d i in this formula risk represents comprehensive risk value w i represents index weight d i represents index value and n represents index number thus a complete sample set is obtained the sample set is arranged chronologically from january 2005 to june 2016 based on the discretization scheme of sub node data the risk data set continuous set is first normalized with range method and then discretized according to the equal interval partition method in table 4 obtaining the discrete set the final training sample set is shown in table 6 5 assessment model for natural environmental risks in key nodes in this section dbn an expanded bn model is used for assessment modeling the dynamic assessment and prediction analysis are carried out on the comprehensive risks of natural environment for illustration purposes this case study only focuses on no 1 node the risk analysis process presented below can be replicated in other key nodes monthly average data for 138 months from 2005 to 2015 are used as the training samples whereas monthly average data from july to december 2016 are the test samples and the interval between adjacent time slices of the network is taken as 1 month 5 1 risk assessment modeling based on dynamic bayesian network the state of the natural environment is affected by several factors which are dynamic to perform effective assessment of the natural environment and identify early warning signs comprehensive systematic and dynamic integration of uncertain information of diverse forms and sources is required the dbn used in this study not only inherits the advantages of static bn but also has higher dynamic data processing capability yu and ding 2014 dbn combines the historical information and the latest evidence in the reasoning process of the final result to perform time accumulation and information update and effectively reduces uncertainty in the process of information fusion and reasoning at different levels yi et al 2012 therefore dbn model is suitable for dynamic assessment of natural environment risk at key nodes nevertheless even if we only carry out the risk assessment of the environmental condition module the challenges of missing data and fuzziness still exists fortunately zhang 2014 postulated that combination of subjective and objective approaches may effectively reduce the uncertainty level thus we adopt this method to build dbn fig 3 displays the technical structure of dbn in this paper expert knowledge is used for structural learning while objective data with em intelligent algorithm is used for parameter learning 5 1 1 introduction to the principle of dynamic bayesian network dbn integrates causal relationships between different time slices and within the same time slice it then performs dynamic analysis and prediction through quantitative reasoning wei et al 2010 according to bn theory dbn is a directed acyclic graph that describes the probability relationship between time series variables this model comprises nodes directed arcs and conditional probability distribution tables it can be represented by a binary group n 0 n feng et al 2012 n 0 represents the initial network namely bn of the initial time slice which defines the prior probability distribution of network nodes within the same time slice n represents a transition network which consists of bn of more than two time slices and defines the transition probability distribution between nodes of different time slices the initial network of dbn represents the initial state of the network the transition network reflects the correlation between adjacent time slices and the magnitude of conditional probability between nodes reflects the strength of causality dbn describes the causal relationship between variables and also the evolution process of variables in time series thus realizing the modeling and analysis of dynamic systems wei et al 2010 li and liu 2018 assuming variable set x x 1 x 2 x n considering a finite period of time 0 1 t the joint probability distribution of x 0 x t is 7 p x 0 x t p x 0 t 1 t i 1 n p x i t π x i t where x i t represents node i at time t π x i t represents parent node of x i t probability reasoning of different time slices and different node states can be obtained through formula 7 the dbn learning is an extension of bn learning in time sequence which comprises structure learning and parameter learning wei et al 2010 the difference is that the initial network n 0 and the transition network n should be constructed simultaneously in the structure learning of dbn the initial state probability p x 0 observation condition probability p x i t π x i t and transition condition probability p x t x t 1 should be determined simultaneously in parameter learning currently two commonly used dbn learning technologies are manual establishment based on expert knowledge and automatic learning based on sample data with intelligent algorithms cussens 2012 5 1 2 dynamic bayesian network structure learning because of the significant causal relationship between variables in the natural environment network modeling of key nodes the expert construction method is adopted to improve the learning efficiency consequently the network structure arcs of nodes in the same time slice and different time slices are determined based on the node variables selected above finally the dbn structure is obtained from the network nodes and the dependency relationship i e the initial network and the transfer network are determined as shown in fig 4 where 1 is the natural environment comprehensive risk value at time t 2 6 is the risk value of each indicator d1 d5 at time t 7 is the natural environment comprehensive risk value at time t 1 and 8 12 is the risk value of each indicator at time t 1 5 1 3 dynamic bayesian network parameter learning the dbn structure is built in the previous section the next step involves learning the parameters constituting determination of the conditional probability distribution the em algorithm is used in parameter learning it is divided into two steps lauritzen 1995 e step infers the distribution p r d θ t of the hidden variable r with the current parameter θ t and observed variables d and calculates the expectation of log likelihood l l θ t r d for r 8 q θ θ t e θ θ t l l θ d r m step finds the parameter to maximize the expectation likelihood 9 θ t 1 a r g m a x q θ θ t each network node is assigned a random probability distribution including prior probability observation probability and transition probability when learning parameters subsequently based on the inference mechanism and the input training data set the em algorithm is used to iteratively revise the node probability distribution and obtain the probability distribution most consistent with the objective training data maximum likelihood estimation of each parameter taking the transition probability as an example the final results are shown in table 7 5 2 experimental evaluation of dynamic bayesian network model network reasoning constitutes updating the state of network nodes based on the current or future information changes to realize the update and transmission of information using the causal relationship between nodes and deduce the state distribution of target nodes specifically first the dbn is used in constructing a joint tree inference mechanism subsequently evidence data is input to infer the probability distribution of the target nodes in this paper risk factors data are discretized and subsequently input as network evidence this involves inputting the discrete values of observation node variables d 1 d 2 d 3 d 4 d 5 the output value constitutes the probability distribution of the natural environmental state of the arctic channel at different times as predicted by the inference the natural environmental status of the no 1 node is evaluated under matlab 2014a environment using the dbn model built in the previous section the corresponding library functions required for this experiment are obtained from the bnt toolbox fullbnt v1 0 4 written by k p murphy 2018 in this section we input the test sample of the risk factors data from july to december 2016 the changes of each variable at this stage are shown in fig 5 the dbn model is used for inference to obtain the probability distribution of the natural environment state at this stage finally we choose the state corresponding to the maximum probability as the final evaluation result shown in bold the probability distribution of the natural environment state of no 1 node at this stage is shown in table 8 the evaluation results indicate that the comprehensive risk of the natural environment of no 1 node increased monthly from july to december the july to august risk was the smallest constituting the best airworthiness period fig 5 shows that the state of all risk factors is optimal from july to august so the probability of feedback to the result corresponding to the lower risk level is highest in these five months thus dbn model can effectively capture the changes of the state of minor nodes which is further reflected in the reasoning results however the risk level in the months of november to december is relatively high and the natural environmental factors are unfavorable for navigation safety based on the monthly changes of the sea ice condition baksh et al 2018 pointed out that sea ice was the main natural cause of arctic shipping accidents at the no 1 node july to august is suitable but this state worsens after august maximum levels of the speed of wind the thickness of sea ice and the sea ice density are observed from november to december these evaluation results are consistent with the actual situation 6 verification of accuracy and validity of the risk assessment model for dynamic bayesian network the above experiments confirm the applicability of the dbn model in the navigation channels natural environment risk assessment next we compared the dbn model to the fahp based on triangular fuzzy stochastic simulation fahp tfss model and bn model simultaneously we performed the dbn model updating reasoning experiment to verify the superiority of the technology on index data updating 6 1 comparative analysis of fahp tfss comprehensive evaluation technology fahp tfss comprehensive risk evaluation model is based on the use of random simulation method to simulate triangular fuzzy numbers simplifies triangular fuzzy numbers and inter function operations into common real number operations reflects the risk situation of the system under the comprehensive influence of various uncertain factors and provides evaluation results in the form of confidence intervals jin et al 2009 compared with conventional methods fahp fahp tfss is more reliable in the form of confidence interval at present the fahp tfss technology has been applied in the comprehensive risk assessment of various complex systems such as water environment risk and basin flood risk wang and chen 2010 jin et al 2011 2012 and is a good model to deal with the comprehensive assessment under various uncertain factors incomplete fuzzy and random data etc the fahp tfss model is used to evaluate the comprehensive risk in natural environment of the no 1 node the following risk value confidence intervals confidence level 95 are obtained from july to december 2016 0 1222 0 1996 0 0958 0 1726 0 2805 0 3649 0 2975 0 3803 0 3100 0 3918 and 0 3781 0 4597 the left end value of the confidence interval is denoted as fahp tfss low and the right end value as fahp tfss high comparison results of these two evaluation models are shown in fig 6 the fahp tfss model uses triangular fuzzy numbers for stochastic simulation but essentially combines various risk factors with expert experience from the inference results obtained by the fahp tfss model it can be seen that the state of the natural environment improves the value decreases from july to august and after august the state gradually worsens the value increases the dbn evaluation results in this paper also reveal this trend of change of note the results of dbn model are congruent with those of expert s empirical judgment which illustrates the rationality of the evaluation results moreover similar to fahp tfss dbn can objectively achieve the fusion of multi source information and dynamic reasoning which increases the objectivity and accuracy of the results combining the time trends of hydrological and meteorological elements from july to december the fahp tfss reasoning results change too drastically from august to september and too gentle from october to november this is because fahp tfss does not consider the effect of time on information 6 2 comparative analysis of bayesian network in order to test the rationality of considering the time term in this paper the bn model is obtained by removing the transfer network based on the network structure of fig 4 and the natural environment risk is comprehensively evaluated see table 9 for the results of risk inference using the bn model comparison calculation results of the bn and dbn models are approximately similar in describing the trends of the natural environment comprehensive risks of no 1 node however the evaluation results of dbn model are more obvious due to the accumulation of information this is because dbn s reasoning effectively saves and accumulates experience and knowledge previously learned therefore over time more evidence and effective information is obtained this implies that the dbn model significantly improves the reasoning accuracy and reduces the uncertainty of reasoning effectively 6 3 dynamic bayesian network model updating reasoning forecast experiment assuming that the above mentioned risk factor data for july to december are obtained through medium and long term numerical prediction reporting products with the reduction of uncertainty factors the numerical products update and revise the data of various impact factors in september 2016 as shown in table 10 the dbn model is used to evaluate and reason a single time slice in september according to the principle of classification based on the maximum probability the calculation results show that the natural environment state is still low risk which are highly consistent with the previous results the corresponding results are shown in table 11 therefore this experiment shows that dbn model can still draw a highly reliable evaluation conclusion in combination with historical environmental information due to its information accumulation ability when errors occur in observation data simultaneously the probability of high risk natural environment state increases following an update of the information however the probability of low risk decreases with changes of the environmental factors this validates that dbn model has high fault tolerance and strong update capability based on information detection and can realize real time or quasi real time assessment of natural environment risks which is often impossible to realize in previous assessment methods 7 discussion taking no 1 node of ba lan key area as an example the structure and parameters of dbn model are conducted using expert experience and training sample set and reasoning calculation is carried out based on the evidence set results show that the evaluation model can effectively deal with the fusion and reasoning of uncertain information realize dynamic evaluation based on expert knowledge and objective data in addition it combines prior information and updates evidence information consider the time of accumulation of information and has better accuracy and fault tolerance however this study has the following limitations 1 the natural environment safety risk index system of key nodes has insufficient index coverage for instance the navigation risk of the navigation channel may be affected by natural factors such as waves currents and sea ice types therefore the constructed index system in this study is not comprehensive hence requires further improvements 2 we used the modeling ideas of oobn for reference and explored in detail the risks of the natural environment modules however the status of ship and human error modules are not fully analyzed therefore more research should be conducted to address these aspects 3 dbn itself is also a causal reasoning model so we will also learn from the excellent research results of c rise to analyze the probability distribution of risk factors from the perspective of accidents results 8 conclusions 1 this study uses the available data and previous milestones to establish a natural environment risk index system for safety assessment in key nodes of the northwest passage comprising of five indexes gale risk visibility risk sea ice thickness risk sea ice density risk and sea temperature risk 2 according to the multi year 2005 2016 climate average of each index from july to september calculated and historical route data we selected five key nodes in ba lan key navigation area 73 5 n 74 5 n 90 w 75 w as the main research object 3 taking the no 1 node as an example the evaluation results indicate that the comprehensive risk of the natural environment increased monthly from july to december the risk was smallest between july to august making it the best airworthiness period 4 in comparison with fahp tfss and bn models the dbn model objectively realizes the fusion and dynamic reasoning of multi source environmental information over time more evidence and information are obtained therefore the dbn model significantly improves reasoning accuracy and effectively reduces the uncertainty of reasoning 5 by updating the reasoning prediction experiment dbn model can still provide highly reliable evaluation results when combination with historical environmental information moreover the probability of some risk levels is adjusted according to the changes of risk factors this verifies that dbn model has strong updating ability and can realize real time or quasi real time assessment of natural environment

21947,recent global warming has made it possible to exploit and utilize resources in the arctic northwest passage however the harsh natural environment in this sea area poses a major threat to safety during navigation although this passage is extensive the natural environmental state of few key nodes affect the navigability of the entire passage in this paper we describe dynamic assessment of natural environmental risks of key nodes in the arctic northwest passage using dynamic bayesian network dbn specifically index selection and data processing determination of key navigation nodes calculation of evidence based reasoning and verification of dbn model are discussed results show that the dbn model effectively handles uncertainty of information and generates highly accurate inference results in addition it integrates historical information in the reasoning process enables accumulation of information reduces the influence of data errors on the final result and makes the result closer to the real value overall this model provides an important reference for judging the comprehensive risks of natural environment at key nodes keywords arctic northwest passage key node dynamic bayesian network dynamic evaluation 1 introduction the arctic northwest passage generally refers to a passage traversing the beaufort sea in northern alaska the canadian arctic archipelago waters eastern davis strait and baffin bay and finally the pacific and atlantic oceans due to its unique geographical location it can be predicted that this passage will play a vital role in the shipping industry in fact according to borgerson 2008 it has shortened the voyage from seattle to rotterdam by 2000 n miles saving 25 due to such advantages this passage has attracted the attention of many countries in 2008 mv camilla desgagnés set off from montreal canada and became the first merchant ship to use the passage in 2014 the nunavik ice breaking bulk carrier set out from disepchen bay and traveled alone through the entire northwest passage to reach ying kou port in china traditionally the panama canal has been the only trade route between china and north america these successful attempts indicate a more economical passage for trade between china and north america stephens 2016 through the passage trade voyages between china and north america have been shortened by 40 emissions reduced by 1300 tons resulting in considerable savings li 2016 in september 2017 china s snow dragon polar scientific research vessel crossed the northwest passage for the first time directly promoting china s commercial use of the arctic passage opening of this channel not only provides an additional navigation option but also enables change of economic strategic status for countries along the route the northwest passage has many advantages compared to the traditional passage these include a short channel distance low shipping costs simple geopolitics and low risk of pirate attacks zou and huang 2016 however because it is located in a high latitude region the channel also faces disadvantages such as imperfect infrastructure a fragile ecological environment as well as poor emergency response and rescue capabilities additionally it is frozen for most of the year and cannot therefore be efficiently utilized stephens 2016 research on global warming in recent years shows that the arctic region is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world according to the current trends in climate change the area around the arctic sea will be completely ice free as early as the summer of 2050 and all year round by 2100 this means that the navigation period of this passage will be greatly prolonged and its navigable conditions significantly improved making it possible to exploit polar resources sou and flato 2009 khon et al 2010 dan et al 2015 the first requirement for whether a passage can be opened and accepted by everyone is safety during navigation it has therefore become increasingly necessary to perform safety risk analysis of the arctic northwest passage currently there are two kinds of risk assessments for arctic shipping lanes the first one analyzes risk causing mechanisms of each influencing factor here these factors are organically integrated to obtain an intuitive risk state assessment for selecting and adjusting a navigation route the other builds a risk assessment model for traffic accidents in arctic navigation channels specifically maritime accidents are taken as the research object and used to estimate risks of accident scenarios and associated consultations this information is further used to support ship operation decisions thereby minimizing navigation and operation risks in arctic waters the first type of risk assessment has generated the following developments pharand 2007 examined possible disputes over the right of transit passage following the opening of the northwest passage and predicted that a gradual opening of the passage would increase social and political risks the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process fahp approach and grey fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method were subsequently used to identify and quantify navigation risks of the arctic channel based on expert experience li et al 2012 sahin and kum 2015 in addition fu et al 2016 used the bayesian belief networks bbn to develop a causal probabilistic model that predicts the probability of a ship getting stuck in ice of the arctic waters in this causal model a set of input parameters such as hydro meteorological conditions air temperature ice concentration ice thickness sea temperature wave height and wind speed along the analyzed route were considered the second type of risk assessment has also generated numerous developments to achieve better predictability for instance kum and sahin 2015 educed a fault tree ft model for estimating the probability of failure resulting from combinations of faults to analyze navigation related accidents and their causes in the arctic from 1993 to 2011 it must be pointed out here that this model borrows ferdous s theoretical framework and uses fuzzy approach with ft technique to reduce the ambiguity and imprecision arising out of subjectivity of the data ferdous et al 2009 however the ft model mainly analyzes the cause of the accident in order to carry out a detailed investigation from the basic cause to the final result a bow tie bt diagram model has been applied which is a combination of the fault and event tree in this model the event tree et is a mature risk analysis technique used to assess the likelihood of an accident huang et al 2001 but without addressing the incompleteness and inaccuracy in the available data and the inflexibility to absorb new knowledge evidence the credibility of bt and subsequent risk analysis remains a major issue in order to solve the above problems ferdous et al 2013 used fuzzy sets and evidence theory to characterize the uncertainty associated with expert knowledge while merging the knowledge of multiple experts and updating existing knowledge with new evidence effectively increasing the credibility of quantitative assessment models based on this framework have also been applied in arctic shipping and accident for example abbassi et al 2017 used the bt relationship to represent causes of accidents their consequences and the probability of occurrence during navigation in arctic waters however this model is incapable of handling accident scenarios where redundant common cause or dependent failures occur khakzad et al 2011 furthermore it does not use real time information to update probabilities of failures in primary events and safety barriers khan et al 2014 to overcome these limitations and dynamically assess transportation risks the bayesian network bn was proposed for modeling accidents khan et al 2014 proposed a causality based approach using bn to estimate the probability of maritime accidents and their related consequences similarly afenyo et al 2017 used bn to analyze the collision scenarios between the ship and the arctic iceberg the use of bayesian network offers analysts the opportunity to model interdependencies among the casual factors which is not possible in conventional methods like the ft in addition baksh et al 2018 proposed a new risk model in which bn is applied to the northern sea route nsr to investigate the possibility of marine accidents including collision foundering and grounding this model considers different operational and environmental factors that affect shipping operations with their base values prior values estimated using historical data and expert judgments experimental results obtained from this model identify ice effect as the dominant factor in accidents zhang 2014 concluded that bns could combine objective data with subjective knowledge to handle these uncertainties the discussion above show that bn is an effective approach for modeling maritime risks however some limitations in standard bn representation make it difficult to learn construct update infer and reason complex models khan et al 2018 to overcome these shortcomings object oriented bayesian network oobn is proposed for modeling and analyzing accidents this model particularly predicts the probability of ship ice collision considering navigational operating and human factors khan et al 2018 in order to deal with the threat of ship oil spill to the ecologically fragile arctic waterway afenyo et al 2019 also applied the oobn model to study oil spill mitigative measures this model overcomes the complexity lack of data and uncertainties in an oil spill and response modeling scenario for arctic shipping accident occurrence so far arctic channel risk assessment modeling cannot adequately visualize waterway risks through the fusion of risk causing factors analysis of accidents is developing towards quantification bt model dynamics bn model and modularization oobn model numerous factors affect the safety of ship navigation these include technical faults including ship navigational system states and operational system states environmental conditions such as ice and weather states social factors including local regulations pirates and economic disputes human error rothblum 2000 bowditch 2002 advisory 2009 canadian coast guard 2012 advisory 2014 sahin and kum 2015 environment canada 2016 khan et al 2018 however quantitative characterization cannot be currently directly performed due to a high degree of uncertainty in internal causes such as technical failures of ships and human caused operational errors this article therefore focuses on analysis and quantification of risks in the environmental conditions module by consulting several literatures and analyzing the unique climate and geographical location of the arctic region we will discuss the characteristics of the natural environment of the northwest passage from two aspects meteorological environment and hydrological environment there are many routes in the northwest passage generally speaking only the natural environment of some key nodes influence the overall navigability of the passage fu 2012 we evaluate natural environmental conditions in several key sea areas of the northwest passage through reviewing the past researches we integrate various risk factors to obtain intuitive risk assessment the common theoretical evaluation methods currently in use include ahp fahp and bn due to the strong subjectivity of ahp and fuzzy evaluation it is difficult to express and deal with uncertain information in addition these methods are unable to use the accident precursor information to revise the risk profile kalantarnia 2009 in order to overcome this shortcoming kalantarnia 2009 introduced the concept of dynamic risk assessment and used bayesian theory to update the likelihood of the event occurrence and also failure probability of the safety system in case studies the importance of learning and prediction tools in risk assessment is demonstrated by comparison with traditional methods bn is built under the framework of bayesian theory so it also overcomes the deficiencies of ahp and fahp in risk assessment to a certain extent bn can calculate the probability of unknown parameters as well as update that of known variables using conditional probability kjaerulff 1995 but it is limited in dealing with dynamic time series information in fact the general bn is static for example the joint probability distribution is usually a representation of a fixed point or an interval of time mcnaught and zagorecki 2010 furthermore bn does not consider the correlation and mutual supplement of the information before and after time so it cannot realize dynamic evaluation dynamic bayesian network dbn describes the evolution of joint probability distribution over time and thus extends the bn discrete time modeling proposed by dean and kanazawa 1989 represents progression of time in the dbn in dbn arcs links nodes from previous time slice to that of the next time slice to represent temporal dependencies among them montani et al 2005 included temporal aspects to perform reliability analysis to demonstrate capabilities of dbn in a dependability analysis therefore application of dbn would improve flexibility during risk analysis as a new intelligent knowledge expression and reasoning tool dbn has strong advantages when dealing with uncertain expression of time series information and reasoning problems related to complex structures its application in dynamic evaluation and prediction is expected to set the trend for future development currently few studies have investigated the used of dbn for intelligent modeling the focus has been on assessing safety of production and transportation processes however application of this tool for environmental risk assessment in the arctic sea has not been tested the available documents only allow preliminary assessment modeling and perform analysis based on dbn khakzad et al 2012 pauplin and jiang 2012 barua et al 2016 li et al 2018 zeng and zio 2018 however in these studies manual determination of network structure and parameters was completely based on expert knowledge and not objective data analysis and therefore lacks the process of automatically learning node parameters from actual data which is highly subjective based on the above correlation analysis this paper relies on quantification dynamics and modularization concepts we begin with the natural environment module target key nodes on the passage and relies on the theory of dbn on the basis of analysis of risk factors of marine environment in key sea areas of the northwest passage establishment of network structure learning of node parameters and reasoning calculation a dbn model for assessing the natural environment in the arctic is established this is based on expert knowledge and objective data combines prior information and updated evidence information it also fully considers the time effect of information accumulation to achieve quantitative dynamic and modular risk assessment the rest of the paper is structured as follows section 1 introduces the risk causing mechanism data sources normalization scheme and interannual distribution characteristics of the risk causing factors selected in this paper a number of key nodes on the northwest passage are identified in section 2 while section 3 generates discretized sample data sets a case study is presented in section 4 to describe the application of the method the accuracy and validity of the dbn risk assessment model are verified in section 5 2 index selection and data source we utilize the unique climate and geographical location of the northwest passage to identify causes of risks in natural environment meteorological and hydrological environment and define its risk bearing body and related consequences the effect of various risk causing factors is shown in table 1 2 1 a risk indicator system for natural environment safety according to the analysis described above ships and personnel sailing in the northwest passage were used as risk carriers to identify the main risk factors affecting the meteorological and hydrological environment the selected factors are shown in table 2 2 2 discriminating layer meaning risk mechanism data source and quantitative method the indicators are defined and quantified to ensure a strong intuitive reflection of their attributes and characteristics based on objective facts and predecessors bai et al 2009 lu 2012 this section redefines and quantifies the five indicators in the previous section 2 2 1 gale risk index d1 definition gale risk index refers to the degree of threat from gale weather to vessels in the target area and is mainly reflected by the wind speed risk mechanism in case of gale it is easy encounter accidents such as yaw anchoring and stranding of the ship when sailing in the polar regions the wind also blows ice floes posing a potential threat to the ship data sources and description wind speed is extracted from the era high precision monthly average reanalysis dataset from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf which records worldwide meridional and zonal wind speeds to obtain the latest natural environmental risk characteristics of the northwest passage monthly average data from 2005 to 2016 is selected as the time series quantification formula 1 d 1 w 2 w min 2 w 10 8 1 w 10 8 according to energy science the intensity of strong winds depends on wind speed in formula 1 w denotes the original value of wind speed in the evaluation unit while w min is the lowest standard value of the strong wind with a value of 10 8 m s yang et al 2013 2 2 2 visibility risk index d2 definition visibility risk index refers to the extent to which visibility in a target area threatens the safety of vessel in the sea the larger the indicator value the greater the risk risk mechanism in meteorology visibility refers to the maximum horizontal distance that can be seen by normal eyes when sailing in the arctic factors that affect visibility mainly include sea fog snow blowing hail etc among these fog is the most important factor during low visibility conditions it is difficult to identify obstacles which may lead to collision between ships and ice july and august is the best time for ships to navigate owing to the melting of sea ice however frequent advection fog compromises the safety of ships data sources and brief introduction the monthly average visibility data from 2005 to 2016 are obtained based on bp neural network regression inversion algorithm shan et al 2019 the scheme uses the relevant factors such as aerosol relative humidity precipitation etc that affect visibility to carry out visibility inversion by constructing bp network and corrects the deviation by combining the ocean visibility data from the stations released by the national climate data centre of the united states quantification formula 2 d 2 1 v v min v max v min in the formula v is the original visibility value of the evaluation unit while v min and v max are minimum and maximum visibility values in the study sample area respectively 2 2 3 sea ice thickness risk index d3 definition sea ice thickness hazard index refers to the threat level posed by thickness of sea ice to the shipping vessel in a target area risk mechanism larger sea ice thickness indicates thicker ice based on this it will bring great challenges to the ship s ability to break ice increase the possibility of the ship being stuck which compromises rescue efforts in the event of ship accident data sources and brief introduction sea ice thickness data are generated from the monthly averages in the output of the pan arctic ice ocean modeling and assistance system piomas sea ice model released by the university of washington in the u s quantification formula 3 d 3 k k min k max k min in the formula k is the original value of sea ice thickness of the evaluation unit while k min and k max are the minimum and maximum values of the sea ice thickness in the study sample area respectively 2 2 4 sea ice density risk index d4 definition sea ice density risk index refers to the degree of threat of sea ice to shipping vessels in a target area the higher the concentration of sea ice the greater the risk risk mechanism the higher the concentration of sea ice the more ice there is on the sea surface this risk index d4 tests the continuous ability of ships to break ice and further increases the probability of formation of floating ice iceberg which endangers the safety of ships data source and brief introduction sea ice density is extracted from the era high precision monthly average reanalysis dataset monthly average data from 2005 to 2016 is selected as the time series quantification formula 4 d 4 i i min i max i min in the formula i denotes the original value of sea ice density of the evaluation unit while i min and i max are minimum and maximum values of sea ice density in the study sample area respectively 2 2 5 sea temperature risk index d5 definition low temperature risk index refers to the degree of threat to shipping vessels caused by low sea surface temperatures in a target area risk mechanism when sailing in the arctic region low temperature influences ships in the following aspects firstly low temperature causes the sea surface to freeze and form an ice layer which impairs ship navigation secondly when the ship is sailing waves rain and snow cause ice accretion when the temperature is relatively low thereby indirectly affecting its navigation lastly low temperature decreases the living conditions of the crew inconveniencing their normal life and work this inevitably affects operation of the ship xie 2014 data sources and brief introduction sea surface temperature is extracted from the era high precision monthly average reanalysis dataset monthly average data from 2005 to 2016 is selected as the time series quantification formula 5 d 5 0 t 0 c t t min 0 t min t 0 c in the formula t denotes the original value of sea surface temperature sst while t min is minimum value of sst in the study sample area respectively 2 3 spatial distribution characteristics of climatic state of each index in an ideal navigation period in this paper northwest passage and its surrounding waters are taken as the target area spanning from 60 w to 135 w 66 n 77 n coordinates according to previous research july september is the ideal navigation period in this passage howell et al 2009 therefore we calculate the multi year 2005 2016 climatic average value of each index from july to september based on this spatial distribution of the climate natural indicators in the time period when the passage is most likely to be opened are analyzed see fig 1 based on sea ice density ice in the northwest passage covers the low east and high west regions the risk of busia bay and the mcclintock strait is higher lower in baffin bay in terms of sea ice thickness it is evident that the waterway is generally in a low risk state while the channel between victoria island and prince of wales in high risk state based on temperature the findings show that the risk in some sea areas such as the mcclintock strait is high moreover the wind speed poses medium to low risk in the northwest passage but high risk in the mcclintock strait and busia bay in terms of visibility the northwest passage is generally at medium to low risk but the relative risk increases at high latitude regions 3 determination of key nodes in the northwest passage as can be seen from the above the status of influence factors varies from place to place in the northwest passage in actual navigation navigation routes are usually determined according to the specific application conditions if the risk assessment is carried out for the entire northwest passage the efficiency decreases as well as the significance several key nodes in these channels cannot be avoided in actual navigation its natural environment is of great significance for navigation if the key sea areas are not navigable the entire route basically cannot be traversed in this section we will focus on the selection of key nodes in the general route of the northwest passage 3 1 determination of key sea areas in the northwest passage although the global views on the general route of the northwest passage are similar this is not the case for the specific route of the northwest passage analysis of different aspects of this passage has identified 7 main routes namely north northwest passage road nnpr prince of wales strait pws peel strait ps peel strait ps adjustment route prince regent inlet pri prince regent inlet pri adjustment route 1 and prince regent inlet pri adjustment route 2 pharand 2007 from historical studies fu 2012 jie et al 2010 the opening degree of the northwest passage is largest in august and september in a given year while the number of navigable sea areas in october and november have declined sharply in recent years making it almost impassable on average all waters except barrow strait lancaster sound and the northern waters of victoria strait open in august these waters partially open in mid september therefore we identify three key sea areas that affect or determine whether the northwest passage of the arctic is navigable i e the ba lan key area the ba mai mei key area and the northern sea area of the victoria strait among them ba lan is located at the eastern exit of the northwest passage which is the preferred exit for all routes except route 7 since the condition of routes along route 7 are not favorable we infer that ba lan key area is the only area that affects the navigability of the entire northwest passage fu 2012 a key advantage of this area is that it receives the west greenland warm current jie et al 2010 although it is difficult to navigate in august the sea area is navigable in september when sea ice extent is at minimum there is almost no ice in the ba lan key area thus the ba lan key area 73 5 n 74 5 n 90 w 75 w is finally chosen as the research focus the changes of natural environment risks in this sea area are determined using real time data 3 2 determination of key nodes based on recommendations in the book called arctic navigation guide northwest passage 2015 we identified several points maritime administration of the people s republic of china 2016 by considering several factors such as hydrometeorology sea ice rescue and logistics services obstruction of navigation and prohibition of navigation as shown in table 3 and fig 2 thus we explore the selected key nodes in key sea areas of the northwest passage we use no 1 node in the key sea area of ba lan as an example to study the dynamic changes in the natural environment risks in these sea areas using real time data 4 generation of target node data target node data i e the comprehensive risk value of natural environment cannot be directly obtained through observation instead it is obtained through calculation considering the limited operational experience and lack of historical accident information of the arctic region the value or probability distribution of the target node was previously generated randomly with markov chain monte carlo framework abbassi et al 2017 or assigned based on experience khan et al 2014 herein the risk factors are linearly fused to reduce the error this section attempts to generate a complete sample set containing target node data in three steps 4 1 discretization of index data for computational reasons the bn is generally restricted to variables with discrete states straub 2005 but the data of the selected indexes are continuous thus it is necessary to discretize the continuous indexes and determine the grade of each index before learning the structure of bn that is to determine the status of network nodes given natural index data in this paper has already normalized the traditional discrete method interval equal interval partition method is adopted in this paper the specific partition methods are shown in table 4 the continuous indexes are divided into discrete grades to generate discrete data sets 4 2 subjective and objective combination determination of the weight value considering that changes in index elements varies with time and entropy weight method determines the weight based on the variation degree of index values which uses the difference between the amount of information of each indicator data to determine the weight thereby reducing the interference of human subjective judgments on the weight liu et al 2011 therefore we employ the entropy weight method to determine the weight in this paper however the pure objective weight determination methods are also limited in some ways if the subjective and objective methods are combined this will avoid excessive reliance on expert knowledge and experience and minimize the mismatch between the data information and the actual cognitive law therefore we adopt a subjective method with wide application scope and good effect g1 huang et al 2008 jing et al 2013 the final weight value is obtained from the weighted sum of the weights determined by the two methods with the subjective and objective methods yielding 0 4 and 0 6 respectively the target node data can be obtained by weighting and summing the data of each observation node the final combined weight values determined by subjective and objective methods are shown in table 5 the calculation results show that the weights of the no 1 point in the key area of ba lan are sea ice thickness d3 sea surface temperature d5 wind intensity d1 sea ice concentration index d4 and low visibility d2 it can be seen that sea ice especially its thickness is still the most important factor hindering further opening of the channel the thickness of sea ice is difficult to measure with ordinary equipment resulting in insufficient quality data when calculating the weight of low visibility index the results obtained by entropy weight method and the g1 method are significantly different the entropy weight method is based on the difference of the amount of information in the data itself due to the scarcity of data and the characteristics of the monthly average data in the northwest passage the results of the entropy weight method have a certain deviation historical research showed that the importance of this indicator was undeniable khan et al 2018 therefore the existence of the g1 method weakens the problem of the mismatch between the results of the entropy method and the objective situation the final result of the weights is consistent with the actual situation of the natural environment elements 4 3 target node data generated by index fusion index fusion is a component of the risk assessment model in this paper the normalized index data and corresponding index weights are fused by weighted synthesis method the fusion formula is as follows 6 risk i 1 n w i d i in this formula risk represents comprehensive risk value w i represents index weight d i represents index value and n represents index number thus a complete sample set is obtained the sample set is arranged chronologically from january 2005 to june 2016 based on the discretization scheme of sub node data the risk data set continuous set is first normalized with range method and then discretized according to the equal interval partition method in table 4 obtaining the discrete set the final training sample set is shown in table 6 5 assessment model for natural environmental risks in key nodes in this section dbn an expanded bn model is used for assessment modeling the dynamic assessment and prediction analysis are carried out on the comprehensive risks of natural environment for illustration purposes this case study only focuses on no 1 node the risk analysis process presented below can be replicated in other key nodes monthly average data for 138 months from 2005 to 2015 are used as the training samples whereas monthly average data from july to december 2016 are the test samples and the interval between adjacent time slices of the network is taken as 1 month 5 1 risk assessment modeling based on dynamic bayesian network the state of the natural environment is affected by several factors which are dynamic to perform effective assessment of the natural environment and identify early warning signs comprehensive systematic and dynamic integration of uncertain information of diverse forms and sources is required the dbn used in this study not only inherits the advantages of static bn but also has higher dynamic data processing capability yu and ding 2014 dbn combines the historical information and the latest evidence in the reasoning process of the final result to perform time accumulation and information update and effectively reduces uncertainty in the process of information fusion and reasoning at different levels yi et al 2012 therefore dbn model is suitable for dynamic assessment of natural environment risk at key nodes nevertheless even if we only carry out the risk assessment of the environmental condition module the challenges of missing data and fuzziness still exists fortunately zhang 2014 postulated that combination of subjective and objective approaches may effectively reduce the uncertainty level thus we adopt this method to build dbn fig 3 displays the technical structure of dbn in this paper expert knowledge is used for structural learning while objective data with em intelligent algorithm is used for parameter learning 5 1 1 introduction to the principle of dynamic bayesian network dbn integrates causal relationships between different time slices and within the same time slice it then performs dynamic analysis and prediction through quantitative reasoning wei et al 2010 according to bn theory dbn is a directed acyclic graph that describes the probability relationship between time series variables this model comprises nodes directed arcs and conditional probability distribution tables it can be represented by a binary group n 0 n feng et al 2012 n 0 represents the initial network namely bn of the initial time slice which defines the prior probability distribution of network nodes within the same time slice n represents a transition network which consists of bn of more than two time slices and defines the transition probability distribution between nodes of different time slices the initial network of dbn represents the initial state of the network the transition network reflects the correlation between adjacent time slices and the magnitude of conditional probability between nodes reflects the strength of causality dbn describes the causal relationship between variables and also the evolution process of variables in time series thus realizing the modeling and analysis of dynamic systems wei et al 2010 li and liu 2018 assuming variable set x x 1 x 2 x n considering a finite period of time 0 1 t the joint probability distribution of x 0 x t is 7 p x 0 x t p x 0 t 1 t i 1 n p x i t π x i t where x i t represents node i at time t π x i t represents parent node of x i t probability reasoning of different time slices and different node states can be obtained through formula 7 the dbn learning is an extension of bn learning in time sequence which comprises structure learning and parameter learning wei et al 2010 the difference is that the initial network n 0 and the transition network n should be constructed simultaneously in the structure learning of dbn the initial state probability p x 0 observation condition probability p x i t π x i t and transition condition probability p x t x t 1 should be determined simultaneously in parameter learning currently two commonly used dbn learning technologies are manual establishment based on expert knowledge and automatic learning based on sample data with intelligent algorithms cussens 2012 5 1 2 dynamic bayesian network structure learning because of the significant causal relationship between variables in the natural environment network modeling of key nodes the expert construction method is adopted to improve the learning efficiency consequently the network structure arcs of nodes in the same time slice and different time slices are determined based on the node variables selected above finally the dbn structure is obtained from the network nodes and the dependency relationship i e the initial network and the transfer network are determined as shown in fig 4 where 1 is the natural environment comprehensive risk value at time t 2 6 is the risk value of each indicator d1 d5 at time t 7 is the natural environment comprehensive risk value at time t 1 and 8 12 is the risk value of each indicator at time t 1 5 1 3 dynamic bayesian network parameter learning the dbn structure is built in the previous section the next step involves learning the parameters constituting determination of the conditional probability distribution the em algorithm is used in parameter learning it is divided into two steps lauritzen 1995 e step infers the distribution p r d θ t of the hidden variable r with the current parameter θ t and observed variables d and calculates the expectation of log likelihood l l θ t r d for r 8 q θ θ t e θ θ t l l θ d r m step finds the parameter to maximize the expectation likelihood 9 θ t 1 a r g m a x q θ θ t each network node is assigned a random probability distribution including prior probability observation probability and transition probability when learning parameters subsequently based on the inference mechanism and the input training data set the em algorithm is used to iteratively revise the node probability distribution and obtain the probability distribution most consistent with the objective training data maximum likelihood estimation of each parameter taking the transition probability as an example the final results are shown in table 7 5 2 experimental evaluation of dynamic bayesian network model network reasoning constitutes updating the state of network nodes based on the current or future information changes to realize the update and transmission of information using the causal relationship between nodes and deduce the state distribution of target nodes specifically first the dbn is used in constructing a joint tree inference mechanism subsequently evidence data is input to infer the probability distribution of the target nodes in this paper risk factors data are discretized and subsequently input as network evidence this involves inputting the discrete values of observation node variables d 1 d 2 d 3 d 4 d 5 the output value constitutes the probability distribution of the natural environmental state of the arctic channel at different times as predicted by the inference the natural environmental status of the no 1 node is evaluated under matlab 2014a environment using the dbn model built in the previous section the corresponding library functions required for this experiment are obtained from the bnt toolbox fullbnt v1 0 4 written by k p murphy 2018 in this section we input the test sample of the risk factors data from july to december 2016 the changes of each variable at this stage are shown in fig 5 the dbn model is used for inference to obtain the probability distribution of the natural environment state at this stage finally we choose the state corresponding to the maximum probability as the final evaluation result shown in bold the probability distribution of the natural environment state of no 1 node at this stage is shown in table 8 the evaluation results indicate that the comprehensive risk of the natural environment of no 1 node increased monthly from july to december the july to august risk was the smallest constituting the best airworthiness period fig 5 shows that the state of all risk factors is optimal from july to august so the probability of feedback to the result corresponding to the lower risk level is highest in these five months thus dbn model can effectively capture the changes of the state of minor nodes which is further reflected in the reasoning results however the risk level in the months of november to december is relatively high and the natural environmental factors are unfavorable for navigation safety based on the monthly changes of the sea ice condition baksh et al 2018 pointed out that sea ice was the main natural cause of arctic shipping accidents at the no 1 node july to august is suitable but this state worsens after august maximum levels of the speed of wind the thickness of sea ice and the sea ice density are observed from november to december these evaluation results are consistent with the actual situation 6 verification of accuracy and validity of the risk assessment model for dynamic bayesian network the above experiments confirm the applicability of the dbn model in the navigation channels natural environment risk assessment next we compared the dbn model to the fahp based on triangular fuzzy stochastic simulation fahp tfss model and bn model simultaneously we performed the dbn model updating reasoning experiment to verify the superiority of the technology on index data updating 6 1 comparative analysis of fahp tfss comprehensive evaluation technology fahp tfss comprehensive risk evaluation model is based on the use of random simulation method to simulate triangular fuzzy numbers simplifies triangular fuzzy numbers and inter function operations into common real number operations reflects the risk situation of the system under the comprehensive influence of various uncertain factors and provides evaluation results in the form of confidence intervals jin et al 2009 compared with conventional methods fahp fahp tfss is more reliable in the form of confidence interval at present the fahp tfss technology has been applied in the comprehensive risk assessment of various complex systems such as water environment risk and basin flood risk wang and chen 2010 jin et al 2011 2012 and is a good model to deal with the comprehensive assessment under various uncertain factors incomplete fuzzy and random data etc the fahp tfss model is used to evaluate the comprehensive risk in natural environment of the no 1 node the following risk value confidence intervals confidence level 95 are obtained from july to december 2016 0 1222 0 1996 0 0958 0 1726 0 2805 0 3649 0 2975 0 3803 0 3100 0 3918 and 0 3781 0 4597 the left end value of the confidence interval is denoted as fahp tfss low and the right end value as fahp tfss high comparison results of these two evaluation models are shown in fig 6 the fahp tfss model uses triangular fuzzy numbers for stochastic simulation but essentially combines various risk factors with expert experience from the inference results obtained by the fahp tfss model it can be seen that the state of the natural environment improves the value decreases from july to august and after august the state gradually worsens the value increases the dbn evaluation results in this paper also reveal this trend of change of note the results of dbn model are congruent with those of expert s empirical judgment which illustrates the rationality of the evaluation results moreover similar to fahp tfss dbn can objectively achieve the fusion of multi source information and dynamic reasoning which increases the objectivity and accuracy of the results combining the time trends of hydrological and meteorological elements from july to december the fahp tfss reasoning results change too drastically from august to september and too gentle from october to november this is because fahp tfss does not consider the effect of time on information 6 2 comparative analysis of bayesian network in order to test the rationality of considering the time term in this paper the bn model is obtained by removing the transfer network based on the network structure of fig 4 and the natural environment risk is comprehensively evaluated see table 9 for the results of risk inference using the bn model comparison calculation results of the bn and dbn models are approximately similar in describing the trends of the natural environment comprehensive risks of no 1 node however the evaluation results of dbn model are more obvious due to the accumulation of information this is because dbn s reasoning effectively saves and accumulates experience and knowledge previously learned therefore over time more evidence and effective information is obtained this implies that the dbn model significantly improves the reasoning accuracy and reduces the uncertainty of reasoning effectively 6 3 dynamic bayesian network model updating reasoning forecast experiment assuming that the above mentioned risk factor data for july to december are obtained through medium and long term numerical prediction reporting products with the reduction of uncertainty factors the numerical products update and revise the data of various impact factors in september 2016 as shown in table 10 the dbn model is used to evaluate and reason a single time slice in september according to the principle of classification based on the maximum probability the calculation results show that the natural environment state is still low risk which are highly consistent with the previous results the corresponding results are shown in table 11 therefore this experiment shows that dbn model can still draw a highly reliable evaluation conclusion in combination with historical environmental information due to its information accumulation ability when errors occur in observation data simultaneously the probability of high risk natural environment state increases following an update of the information however the probability of low risk decreases with changes of the environmental factors this validates that dbn model has high fault tolerance and strong update capability based on information detection and can realize real time or quasi real time assessment of natural environment risks which is often impossible to realize in previous assessment methods 7 discussion taking no 1 node of ba lan key area as an example the structure and parameters of dbn model are conducted using expert experience and training sample set and reasoning calculation is carried out based on the evidence set results show that the evaluation model can effectively deal with the fusion and reasoning of uncertain information realize dynamic evaluation based on expert knowledge and objective data in addition it combines prior information and updates evidence information consider the time of accumulation of information and has better accuracy and fault tolerance however this study has the following limitations 1 the natural environment safety risk index system of key nodes has insufficient index coverage for instance the navigation risk of the navigation channel may be affected by natural factors such as waves currents and sea ice types therefore the constructed index system in this study is not comprehensive hence requires further improvements 2 we used the modeling ideas of oobn for reference and explored in detail the risks of the natural environment modules however the status of ship and human error modules are not fully analyzed therefore more research should be conducted to address these aspects 3 dbn itself is also a causal reasoning model so we will also learn from the excellent research results of c rise to analyze the probability distribution of risk factors from the perspective of accidents results 8 conclusions 1 this study uses the available data and previous milestones to establish a natural environment risk index system for safety assessment in key nodes of the northwest passage comprising of five indexes gale risk visibility risk sea ice thickness risk sea ice density risk and sea temperature risk 2 according to the multi year 2005 2016 climate average of each index from july to september calculated and historical route data we selected five key nodes in ba lan key navigation area 73 5 n 74 5 n 90 w 75 w as the main research object 3 taking the no 1 node as an example the evaluation results indicate that the comprehensive risk of the natural environment increased monthly from july to december the risk was smallest between july to august making it the best airworthiness period 4 in comparison with fahp tfss and bn models the dbn model objectively realizes the fusion and dynamic reasoning of multi source environmental information over time more evidence and information are obtained therefore the dbn model significantly improves reasoning accuracy and effectively reduces the uncertainty of reasoning 5 by updating the reasoning prediction experiment dbn model can still provide highly reliable evaluation results when combination with historical environmental information moreover the probability of some risk levels is adjusted according to the changes of risk factors this verifies that dbn model has strong updating ability and can realize real time or quasi real time assessment of natural environment

21948,this paper presents the challenges faced in modelling marine operations with a particular focus on lifting in air those challenges are looked at from a purely modelling perspective showing various approaches encountered in the literature paper further discusses the disadvantages of those models and proposes a 3 dof solution that allows to observe all of the physical phenomena and their possible relation enabling efficient in depth studies of the operations in discussion the proposed model is presented in detail starting from a computation of excitation through the numerical approach with a variety of interesting results an advantage of the presented approach is seen in the analytical modelling what allows for a theoretical numerical and combined analysis the model allows for an implementation of a variety of excitation types providing an ability to study responses to regular and irregular wave a phenomenon of a parametric resonance was discovered what allows for a reliable assessment of dynamic behaviour emphasising another advantageous feature of the model in comparison to other approaches discussed paper is concluded by a validation of the proposed methodology it is also suggested that the model proposed is a good computationally viable easily accessible balance between overly simple and overly complex models keywords pendulum motion compensation regular and irregular wave excitation offshore lifting modelling offshore lifting operations offshore dynamics parametric resonance detecting capability 1 introduction 1 1 overview increasing exploitation of underwater natural resources triggered rapid development of the offshore industry in the area of modern technologies over the course of last decades one of the challenges in performing activities offshore is naturally the necessity to deal with the surrounding environment the operational intensification with regards to lifting operations is therefore strongly related to the isolation of vibration between the floating object and a lifted payload a solution allowing for reliable performance in difficult weather conditions offers meaningful improvement to the operational expenditure by minimising downtime one of the largest non productive costs that the offshore industry is exposed to several technologies and operational practices have been developed to assist with this but it is believed that the boundaries can still be pushed further a major limitation to trigger a widespread research is an access to an appropriate dynamic modelling tool any lifting operation undertaken offshore consists of several phases depending on the operation characteristics these might include but are not limited to a lift off an object is lifted off from its position b handling in air an object is suspended in air or manoeuvred to the desired position c splash zone crossing an object immersing through a water surface d deep water lowering a payload lowering towards the seabed e seabed landing an object installation onto the seafloor dynamics of the payload in air is mainly driven by the vessel motion with a minor thanks to modern control filters influence of the crane operation resulting payload motion problems are related to two prevailing phenomena heave and pendulum appropriate understanding and control of the payload dynamics might considerably increase the operation efficiency and profitability the purpose of this work is to propose a new balanced approach between variety of currently applied methods being either overly simplified or on the contrary highly complex the authors present a model that incorporates the most important features of the models popular in the literature but also introduces a significant advantage to the research methodology two distinctive features of the proposed 3 dof model are allowing for a detection of system instability and controlling the dynamics by means of changing the system stiffness characteristic the model also provides the ability to investigate the system heave excitation and heave response influence on the pendulum behaviour amongst other aspects the paper will discuss the computation of the kinematic excitation at the crane tip as a result of the ship motions proposed approached utilises rao functions to achieve it as described further in this document at this stage all of the research will be carried out for lifting in air phase to signify the importance of the pendulum motion proposed modelling of the system will allow implementation of compensating stiffness elastic element as an adaptive parameter allowing for system stability analysis and evaluation of its performance the analysis will be performed within the light lift regime by satisfying the criteria stipulated in dnv gl rp n103 modelling and analysis of marine operations dnv gl 2017 and only light lifts will be taken into account this conclusion allows to disregard the payload influence on the vessel dynamic enabling greater efficiency in modelling the ship motions as discussed further in the text 1 2 state of the art many proposals of offshore lifting modelling were found in the literature but most of them present methods of compensation for heave and pendulum separately the book albers 2010 shows the hydraulic based device as the simplest form of a passive heave compensator based on a hydraulic accumulator the presented solution is modelled as a simplified second order linear dynamic model the author also described an active control system which utilises simple feed forward mechanism the same modelling approach was taken in dnv gl 2017 where a dynamic model of a two degree of freedom passive heave compensator is depicted as a simplified second order linear system moving only in the vertical direction the author tong et al 2013 presented a hydraulic arrangement integrated with a reeving system controlled with a plc where the compensation focuses on heave only the system was modelled as a first order linear dynamic model taking into account the stiffness and damping of the compensator another paper kurowski et al 2012 presents a mathematical model of an offshore pedestal crane where the compensating element was referred to as a shock absorber and designed so that it works only under the tension load according to the authors it is characterised by a greater efficiency simpler and more compact construction the aforementioned shock absorber was modelled as a point mass connected to the boom by the means of a spring damper system the problem of compensation of vessel motions induced by waves is also described by szczotka 2010 the author presents a different approach to control where presented compensating system is based on a a frame mounted over the moonpool the considerations concern an in line cross beam mounted compensator the main component responsible for the elimination of the load movement used a special actuator controlled by a digital pid that moved the pulleys and changed the length of the rope controlling the position of the payload the most popular way of compensation is a choice of the right winch drive function such an approach was shown by osiński and wojciech 1998 and fałat 2004 the selection of drives was made by the dynamic optimisation and several proposed solutions were described by tomczyk 2009 all of the discussed papers present a simplified approach to modelling of axial motion of payload uncoupling the pendulation it seems to be too much of a simplification especially in cases analysed for resonant states scientific research regarding the subject of a pendulum motion compensation can also be found in literature although they are much rarer the reason may be that the pendulum swing motion attenuation is more difficult to achieve than a compensation for heave this makes the subject particularly worth of interest additionally operational measures were introduced to reduce the pendulation risk often with avoiding operations in certain conditions specifically in regular swell seas those measures became industry standard but despite general acceptance weather windows could be maximised should another reliable solution be found the article fragopoulos et al 1999 examines the problems of controlling the load sway during offshore lifting operations the kinematic model of a vessel and a crane with an anti pendulation arm attached are presented the whole system forms a double pendulum the model consists of a control arm attached with one end to the crane tip and the other to the lifting cable linearised model engages linear quadratic gaussian control lqg and generalised predictive control methods in the article of balachandran et al 1999 the authors proposed a concept of a mechanical filter to attenuate the pendulum oscillations the idea is based on actively controlled pivot point around which the suspended load moves ship roll induced vibrations are considered only two active ship motion compensation methods of payload sway stabilisation during operations are discussed by schaub 2008 a double layer sliding manifold for offshore container crane occ is presented in the paper of sun et al 2017 to enable the position tracking and sway control simultaneously the model for the occ consists of a ship crane trolley payload system the described model is characterised by the varying length of the wire and the sway angle of the lifted object the authors underline its improved performance against a conventional controller the weak point of the conducted analysis might be a lack of examination of a heave response of the studied model and its impact on the analysed pendulation angle a similar model is proposed by the authors ngo and hong 2012 where it is considered as a three dimensional system the author masoud 2000 and masoud et al 2004 shows a possibility of reducing sway motion by controlling the slew and luff angles of the boom according to the paper such control might be achieved with heavy equipment already being part of the crane so that rebuilding of existing cranes would require smaller effort additionally parametric excitation studies were encountered the article of witz 1995 presents the research on time domain model demonstrating the effect of irregular waves on crane loads causing the parametric excitation all of the mentioned articles do not consider simultaneous action and compensation for heave which seems to be a weakness of current approaches especially in the case of large system displacements 2 theoretical analysis 2 1 the dynamics of the lifted object as per dnv gl standard for certification no 2 22 lifting appliance dnv gl 2011 the vertical loads due to floating unit motions appearing at the crane tip and hence on the lifting payload should be taken into consideration by multiplying the working load by a dynamic amplification factor ψ the daf was evaluated to cover all inertia forces and shock the dynamic amplification factor can be assessed by 1 ψ 1 v r k w g where k geometric stiffness coefficient referred to hook position defined as a force at hook to produce unit deflection at hook kn m g standard acceleration of gravity 9 81 m s2 w working load kn m v r relative velocity m s between the payload and hook at the time of pick up considering the above formula the load on the crane wire during offshore lifting is then equal to the dynamic load which is the working load multiplied by the daf and is expressed as follows 2 f d w ψ w 1 v r k w g considering above one might notice that the reduction in the dynamic load can be achieved by a the reduction in relative velocity leading to a reduction of the operating window b reduction in working load or c adjustment in stiffness coefficient reduction performed by a or b lowers the productivity of offshore operations alternatively by applying a spring with adaptive stiffness into the model an adjustment in the k value would be possible that would directly lead to the decrease of the dynamic loads imposed on the lifted object and the crane 2 2 analysis of reference models in the vast majority of offshore technical solutions the executive system is being hydraulically actuated the principle of work of the hydraulic systems is based on a hydraulic cylinder connection with a piston type accumulator the accumulator also has a function of separating the hydraulic part of the cylinder from the gas bottles filled with nitrogen the combination of both forms a mechanism in which the volume of the attached gas accumulators sets the stiffness of the system a simplified dynamic system of a passive heave compensator according to dnv gl rp n103 modelling and analysis of marine operations dnv gl 2017 might be simplistically modelled by the following system where x 1 t x a s i n ω t vertical displacement at crane tip created by a kinematic excitation m m c mass of heave compensator kg m o mass of lifted object kg k c stiffness of heave compensator n m k w wire stiffness n m e modulus of elasticity pa a nominal cross sectional area of cable m2 l length of cable m c c viscous damping of heave compensator n s m the equations of motion for the simplified model might be then expressed as follows 3 m c 0 0 m 0 x c x 0 c c 0 0 0 x c x 0 k c k w k w k w k w x c x 0 c c x 1 k c x 1 0 another popular and well established case in literature for the modelling of suspended objects exposed to the influence of sea waves is a model of a single or double pendulum in literature sources it is challenging to find any proposals of systems that could directly correspond to the model proposed by the authors of this study which was intentionally designed to fit the operations performed by offshore column cranes the authors fragopoulos et al 1999 ngo and hong 2012 and sun et al 2017 mentioned in 1 2 present systems that compensate ship motions analysed as double or single pendulum models depending on the implemented compensating element 3 proposed model given the extensive simplifications in approaches mentioned above it is suggested to consider a model combining the features of both it is highlighted that the proposed model shown on figs 2 and 4 considers planar motion only at this stage precise analytical description of ships motion requires consideration of two types of motion on the sea waves the first type has a linear character and is described by the following three movements heave sway and surge the second one describes three angular movements determined by yaw roll and pitch which are respectively vertical transverse and longitudinal oscillations of the floating unit under the influence of waves a floating vessel will produce a rocking motion affecting its buoyancy 3 1 excitation modelling as mentioned the investigations conducted were focused on light lifts as per classification from dnv gl 2017 according to this code objects that weigh less than 1 2 of the vessel s displacement estimated to be less than a few hundred tons do not alter its motion characteristic this assumption allowed coupled dynamic analyses to be disregarded and utilise response amplitude operators and phases often referred to as raos in order to obtain the excitation functions raos are an output of diffraction radiation analysis carried out on floating objects floating units are considered to be continuous systems which are subjected to a complex motion characteristics being a composition of a rigid body motion and its vibration in most practical cases naval designs are stiff enough to omit elastic properties of the entire vessel in analytical considerations it allows to adopt the simple model of a rigid body which is described by 6 degrees of freedom such an approach allows the hydrodynamic forces to be represented as a hydrodynamic added mass fluid damping and restoring forces hence the considered case will be modelled by the following matrix equation 4 m v a ω x ω dir c v ω x ω dir k v x ω dir f ω dir the mass term is modified with the implementation of a frequency dependent function which is the hydrodynamic added mass a ω and the final form of the vessel mass matrix will be given as m v a ω the k v is the considered vessel stiffness matrix related to its hydrostatic stability a detailed description of the remaining symbols used is given as follows m v mass matrix of the vessel a ω hydrodynamic added mass c v hydrodynamic damping matrix k v vessel stiffness matrix f ω dir hydrodynamic force vector ω natural frequency dir wave direction the solution of the governing equation 4 for the resulting motion raos where x ω dir r a o ω dir is given by the relation presented in 5 see fig 3 5 r a o ω dir f ω dir ω 2 m v a ω i ω c v ω k v 1 system being described by the relationship given in 4 is composed of 6 second order differential equations what implies 6 linear independent eigenvectors and corresponding eigenvalues an origin of the assumed coordinate frame is placed at the centre of floatation cof in general it cannot be assumed to be the same as a centroid cog of the vessel it causes that motion of cog is a composition of the particular motions due to its eigenmodes in practice at least two or three natural frequencies will be visible at raos spectra raos can take different forms but are most often represented as a direction dependent displacement response per metre wave versus the wave period the raos amplitude depicts a motion amplitude per unit amplitude of wave the raos phase lag represents the phase difference between vessel motion and the waves separate raos are naturally computed for each degree of freedom raos functions can be obtained by the formula 4 or by an application of dedicated computational systems another possibility is to use the empirical data obtained during experimental investigation of the real object but this manner is expensive time consuming and available only for the existing units alternatively the raos can be obtained through a scaled model testing regardless the method used to obtain the raos a numerical set of data including the phase and direction information is obtained what needs to be emphasised geometric properties and the method of establishing raos will to an extent have an influence over the results but will not affect the performance of the model proposed within this text the remote point response spectrum or its specified point are used as an input for calculations of irregular and regular waving respectively and then to establish kinetic and potential energies by computations of displacements and velocities of the system elements that implies a different vessel would change only numerical values of the results but would not compromise the algorithm suitability and effectiveness it is one of the most important advantages of the proposed model to eliminate the necessity to perform computationally expensive hydrodynamic computations ability to adopt raos for computing the excitation enables the methodology to be economically viable within industrial research environment this significantly reduces the effort of modelling the marine operations the method fathom group ltd 2018 journée and massie 2001 used for derivation of the crane tip motions applied basic geometrical properties and a complex signal adding method allowing for both amplitude and phase information to be added correctly and processed further into the harmonic excitation functions excitation motions were calculated at the remote point representing a position of the crane tip small angle approximation was used based on the assumption of the limited operational pitch and roll angles translations due to rotation of the vessel were

individual rotations about their respective component axes 3 2 analytical analysis to simplify the analytical description of a complex ship motion model some assumptions were adopted at the preliminary stage of modelling and only the most important dependencies were used for the derivation of the equations of motion the following assumptions were implemented in the model a the payload motion was considered in yz plane including three degrees of freedom linear heave for the object and the compensator and the angular pendulum of the system b the payload was treated as a material point c the excitation for the base movement was calculated based on the assumptions described in 3 1 this allowed the crane tip to be excited kinematically d the executive element of the compensator was modelled as a spring having stiffness within a specified range e as the considerations concern only lifting in air phase the lifting cable was modelled as a massless element with a specified length and stiffness the purpose of introducing simplifying assumptions seems to be justified and allows a preliminary model to be obtained allowing for the study of the lifting dynamics using simple analytical methods the work performed at this stage allowed for a development of a three degrees of freedom dynamic model of a crane tip equipped with a lifting cable with length dependent stiffness mass and stiffness of the compensator and also mass of the payload the model was prepared so that it allows for an adjustment of the compensator stiffness the proposed 3 dof dynamic model is presented

the figs 1 and 4 3 3 numerical simulations environment the dynamic model considered in the paper is described by three ordinary differential equations of a second order in order to perform numerical simulations the equations were transformed into the first order form the obtained results provide basic information about the dynamic behaviour of the system the sagemath environment sagemath org 2019 was used to conduct the numerical simulations sagemath formerly sage from software for algebra and geometry experimentation is a computer algebra system cas which is a common platform of many advanced tools and programming libraries created to support complex mathematical calculations the authors of the study decided to implement the whole simulation studies in sagemath as it seems to be convenient in its functionality allowing to perform either symbolic or numerical operations the entire program was written in the scripting language python the utilised python based program consists of free libraries only and is distributed under the gnu gpl this gives the possibility of a completely free use for private and commercial purposes the presented advantages make the sagemath environment an interesting alternative to commercial software packages such as mathematica or matlab the ordinary differential equations were solved using the lsoda from the fortran library odepack the utilised method switches automatically between the non stiff adams and the stiff bdf method this procedure is characterised by a satisfactory speed and accuracy numerical simulations of the investigated systems were carried out and discussed in the following section the model itself is subjected to further investigation and verification activities 4 model validation a building block of the proposed method was to introduce a vessel payload decoupled response assumption this was achieved by following the recommendation in dnv gl 2017 and restricting the method to be used within the light lifts regime to ensure validity the authors have conducted numerical analysis taking into account 6 degrees of freedom related to the vessel motion these 6 dofs provide the linear and angular vessel motions directly coupling the two considered systems an initial model developed by the authors has given satisfactory confirmation of the referenced assumption the following three cases were considered by the authors a comparative analysis of the 9 dof model response vessel payload response against the 3 dof model payload response proposed in the article in which the vessel excitation is based on rao s processing methodology b comparative analysis of the payload and vessel response for two vessels of different seakeeping properties c comparative analysis of the payload and vessel response for a number of different payload masses the considerations concern one dimensional forward propagating waves as a vessel excitation the performed tests and results of some of the considered cases are reported for reference fig 5 presents the pendulation amplitude of the object suspended from the crane boom tip excited by the coupled vessel motions for the considered forward propagating excitation wave wave period t 7s the crane tip excitation amplitudes are of the following values lateral tip displacement a y 0 5m vertical tip displacement a z 1 5m which correspond to the excitation amplitudes considered in the 3 dof model payload response simulations presented in fig 15 comparing the results obtained utilising the rao s processing methodology it was observed that the payload response is identical confirming the method s validity for the given mass relationship regime this validation of assumptions allowed time histories to be prepared of the rao changes for a complex model of the vessel payload system see figs 6 and 7 the obtained results show a regular motion of the crane boom tip the frequency amplitude and phase shift are the same as computed with rao s within the accuracy of numerical errors it allows the conclusion that the vessel dynamic properties are transferred through the rao s affecting payload dynamics no additional effects were observed allowing for the claim of ship lifted object coupling for the vessel payload mass ratio regime in consideration it confirms the authors assumption and shows that the methodology based on rao s can be successfully and efficiently used for uncoupled models additionally five subsequent masses up to 2 of total ship displacement as adopted from reference mentioned were considered results of the investigation are depicted in figs 8 10 as spectra obtained by utilisation of fourier analysis in order to enable clearer presentation of the results based on the results provided it might be stated that the frequency structure of payload vibrations is of a different character and is fully independent to vessel heave and pitch oscillations in depth analysis allows for an observation of low frequencies components being revealed in each spectrum but they are of zero amplitudes and are clearly negligible in a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the results the obtained results revealed that there is no significant influence of payload weight on the system frequency structure for the considered mass regime critical harmonic components do not change their position even for limit value of lifted object mass amplitude of dynamic response is marginally lower for the heavier objects but it does not have a meaningful invalidating impact on the proposed methodology higher harmonic components are shifted relative to the reference position but the changes are small and outside of resonance range hence these elements can be omitted in the analysis it was concluded that the assumed simplification is correct and allows the replacement of coupled analysis with the floating vessel rao without raising significant modelling errors payload mass to ship displacement ratios above 2 have also been checked the expected discrepancy in quantitative measures was observed immediately past the threshold value while qualitative divergence between the two methods started to appear at 2 5 in order to validate the proposed mathematical model and hence simulation results the authors of the study decided to involve also the world s leading commercial software package orcaflex software is used for the dynamic analysis of offshore marine systems the orcaflex model was prepared so that the conditions from the discussed analytical model were accurately replicated to examine specific parameters of the models appropriate tests were performed in both environments independently the extracted results from the orcaflex model were a vertical displacement for both of the masses and the sway angle of the system a created model enabled the implantation of the excitation in the kinematic form in two independent directions the authors modelled the wire rope as several massless 2 node elements this corresponds to the model used in the analytical model as per assumptions stipulated earlier in the text the lifting wire was separated to 3 distinct segments a winch element allowing for the controlled length adjustment modelled with the same properties as the lifting wire b main lifting wire element with a fixed length c compensator length element with a negligible stiffness allowing for the incorporation of the compensator element the compensator was represented as a link spanning through a length of the appropriate part of the lifting wire this allowed close control of the stiffness parameter of the compensator and enabled post processing of the desired results compensator mass was attached as a clump weight at the geometric centre of the element in its unstretched length the object was represented as a lumped mass using the 6d buoy element all geometric environmental elastic and rotational properties were neglected at this stage the vessel was set to harmonic motions that only relate directly to the excitation derivation methodology described in 3 1 the study on the orcaflex model allowed comparison of the results with previously performed simulations the comparative results are depicted below analysing the presented figures it can be concluded that the obtained results correspond to the proposed mathematical model discussed in the previous section the results show that the numerical output of the authors dynamics equations and the software are consistent however in figs 11 and 12 some discrepancies between the obtained waveforms might be observed this may be the result of utilisation of different integration methods the orcaflex package orcina ltd 2019 implements two complementary time domain dynamic integration schemes which are an explicit and implicit both of them re compute the system geometry at each time step so that the simulation takes into account all geometric non linearities including the spatial variation of contact and wave loads while the integration scheme implemented by the authors solves a system of ordinary differential equations using lsoda from the fortran library odepack described briefly in 3 3 another reason for that inaccuracy might be the existence of a numerical damping in the integration scheme used in the commercial software for finite element models as they may contain false high frequency response the generalised α integration scheme utilised in orcaflex package is based on a controllable numerical damping which removes artificial high frequency response a much more stable convergence is achieved when numerical damping is implemented into the integration scheme the generalised α integration scheme uses a built in value of 0 4 that according to the software creators was chosen to provide fast simulation run time without compromising its accuracy nevertheless the obtained results might be considered as consistent since the important characteristics remains unchanged proving the validity of the proposed model 5 comparative analysis of the encountered models against the 3 dof model based on the available literature models the authors prepared reference models that allowed comparison of the proposed methodology to the existing ones considerations regarding literature models as in the case of the analysed system were reduced to the analysis of the dynamics of the in plane motion by the implementation of the simplifying assumptions described in 3 2 for analysis purposes the authors proposed two comparative models the first system was modelled on the basis of ngo and hong 2012 and sun et al 2017 as a single pendulum where an excitation was incorporated as an angular roll acting in the yz model plane only the lifted object was modelled as a point mass suspended at the end of pendulum it is worth noting that the reference literature model does not take into account the stiffness characteristics of the system neither the stiffness of the crane nor of the cable that are both crucial when considering lifting operations the crane stiffness should be considered during a variety of lifting phases as it may lead to a change in the system s natural frequency it is understood that with an increase in the cable length crane stiffness becomes less significant in the equivalent system stiffness the second proposed model to study dynamics of the oscillating motion system was the mathieu model being a representation of the simplest model of parametric vibrations besides of vertical heave of the pendulum model moving support the excitation was also given in a lateral direction by the roll angle as in the reference literature model dimensionless form of the mathieu model governing equation is presented in formula 14 as follows 14 φ τ ω 0 2 1 ϵ c o s τ φ τ 0 where τ dimensionless time ω 0 natural frequency ϵ modulation index dynamics of payload sway motion for the simplified models of a mathematical pendulum with moving support was analysed for both cases and compared against the dynamics of the proposed 3 dof model a series of simulations were performed to study the behaviour of the models discussed 5 1 simulations data for a fully comprehensive study of the proposed 3 dof model two types of a wave excitation were applied a regular and irregular wave the parameters presented in table 1 were used in simulations utilising the excitation of regular waving to enable more comprehensive model evaluation studies were also conducted in irregular waves derived based on jonswap spectra theory provided by dnv gl 2018 or dnv gl 2017 and calculated for the specified wave parameters frequency and direction irregular random waves reflecting a real sea state can be represented as a summation of sinusoidal wave components with a random phases based on jonswap spectra an empirical relationship between the distribution of the energy by frequency allows to obtain a reliable representation of a sea state in fig 13 the raos utilised to establish the crane tip excitation are presented and the corresponding wave parameters depicted within the label 5 2 results and discussion numerical simulations were performed for the three analysed models as described in the preceding sections nevertheless it should be noted that the models proposed in the literature do not investigate the compensation for heave and swing motion simultaneously hence a direct comparison is somehow limited also the stiffness considerations seem to have a significant influence on the dynamics of the systems and simulation results the results as shown in figs 14 25 are provided together for a comparison as the reference models do not include the analysis of a vertical displacement of the payload the comprehensive comparison cannot be fully accomplished but the results for the pendulum angle of each model were depicted and are discussed below the comparison was carried out by adjusting the stiffness so that the simulation results of the 3 dof model match the reference ones for the sensitivity analysis of the proposed model heave excitation was first set to 0 to allow for a direct comparison in author s understanding it is one of the biggest issues with the reference models as heave motion is unavoidable in offshore operations further stages of the models comparison were performed by gradually increasing the heave excitation in the proposed model side way excitation was kept the same this shown how quickly the pendulum response deviates from the heaveless model fig 14 shows influence of vertical amplitudes of tip oscillations on payload sway angle vibration frequency was set equal to subharmonic critical frequency of parametric resonance different values of heave a z and constant values of roll a y magnitude were taken into account as expected higher heave excitation amplitudes led to an increase in the payload angular vibration amplitude it also became apparent and proven how important it is to consider the heave excitation when studying and evaluating an amplitude of pendulation angle of lifted objects to emphasise the phenomenon and the payload sway response the simulations were performed for a calculated parametric resonance cable length being within the operational range for high amplitude of heave excitation for 7 s wave period medium slow waves vibration frequency was set equal to subharmonic critical frequency of parametric resonance for each of cases the authors conducted two simulations enabling a direct comparison between the discussed models in each of the figs 15 and 16 three dynamic responses of the analysed systems obtained for the same magnitudes of excitation amplitudes are presented physical parameters of the models were set equal besides the stiffness of the compensating element in the proposed 3 dof model in fig 15 the compensator stiffness was set an order of magnitude higher than for the simulation results depicted in fig 16 artificial stiffening of the 3 dof model allowed to achieve the same simulation results as in the case of the mathieu model where the cable is assumed to be rigid in fig 16 when the stiffness characteristics of the 3 dof model was changed by means of a compensator stiffness value it can be observed that manipulation of system stiffness characteristics which is equivalent to changing the length of the cable has a significant influence on the dynamic behaviour the amplitudes of pendulation angle for the proposed model are then much smaller and even if the resonance is likely to occur its raising rate is much slower and the reached amplitudes much smaller from fig 17 it can be stated that for all of the analysed models when considering stiffened 3 dof model an occurrence of main resonance can be well predicted analysis of figs 17 and 18 in comparison to 20 and 22 when simulations were run for idealised regular wave scenario generated using raos allows to conclude that oscillations with natural frequency are important only for high values of vertical displacements moreover it can be concluded that even small value of surge sway can lead to a change of the resonance type as depicted in fig 18 the model with reduced stiffness is limiting the amplitudes of pendulation even for resonant frequencies results being compatible with fig 18 can be obtained from the analysis of phase portrait presented in fig 19 resonance behaviour is visible as unstable spirals which are tending to infinity stable vibrations are connected with the limited curve figs 20 and 22 present simulations performed for a resonant cable length for idealised regular wave scenario generated using raos in comparison to figs 15 and 16 where the amplitude values of heave a z and roll a y were opposite and a little bit higher it can be observed that parametric resonance is caused by heave of a crane tip however lateral displacement of the crane tip has an important role in the process of an amplitude increase phase portraits depicted in figs 21 and 23 show similar information resonance pendulation caused by vertical tip displacements has a form of deformed unstable spirals additional loop in the central position of portrait is connected with higher harmonics of the solution it does not affect on the system stability regardless the method used to analyse it can be stated that even for small values of its lateral amplitude the resonant raising rate is higher parametric resonance is important in case of regular waves with period about 6 7 s as in the previously discussed cases the change in stiffness of the 3 dof system through the rigidity of the compensator leads to a limitation of the sway amplitudes of the payload it is especially visible at phase portrait shown in fig 23 utilisation of the lower stiffness enable of the compensator leads to a significant change of trajectories resonance behaviour with growing trajectories is replaced with the limited curve which means stable dynamics because of significant simplifications adopted in the reference models e g rigid cable omitted influence of heave simulations conducted for resonance beyond cable length for idealised regular wave scenario shown that the non linear model is limiting the amplitudes of pendulation even for close values of resonant frequencies fig 24 this implies that the system should be stable but high displacements are still present in fig 25 it can be seen that by a change in stiffness of added compensator the dynamic response of the proposed system is characterised by the higher vibration frequency but at the same time achieves only half of the amplitude of payload pendulation analysis conducted on the basis of simulations carried out for each model leads towards relevant conclusions a big disadvantage of the reference models is aforementioned in 2 2 disregarded stiffness of individual components of a system the omission of the stiffness of the crane structure while assuming a lifting cable as a rigid rod leads to changes in the dynamics of the system resulting in changes in its natural frequency when considering a lifting in air phase short cable length results in the high stiffness of the system however along with the payload lowering i e unwinding the lifting cable continuous changes in the rigidity of the whole system occur which certainly affect the dynamics of the analysed model introducing into the 3 dof model an additional compensatorspring allowed to examine how changes in its stiffness affect the amplitudes of angle pendulation of the payload the research led to interesting observations it can be concluded that manipulations in the stiffness of the compensating element lead to a change in the total stiffness characteristics of the system and thus the length between crane tip and payload this in turn leads to a limitation of the amplitude of the payload sway angle changing the rigidity of the system therefore leads to a change and limitation of the angle of pendulation which can be achieved for example through varying the cable length over time the ability to analyse the key vertical displacement of a hanging mass due to heave motion is essential to conduct a fully comprehensive study of the dynamic behaviour of objects during lifting operations all these weaknesses are compensated in the model proposed by the authors of this article as discussed irregular wave studies were also conducted for comprehensiveness fig 26 shows the proposed real sea state excitation obtained from raos depicted in fig 13 after inverse fast fourier transformation in order to assess the proposed model validity the authors expanded the validation database and prepared a number of numerical simulations for irregular wave case all of the obtained results are presented in figs 27 31 as can be seen in figs 27 and 28 even a linear analysis allows to assess resonance occurrence regions reliably and possibly prevent the system from hazardous operations for the specified lifting cable lengths naturally the nonlinear model reflects the real behaviour of the system more truthfully despite limitation of amplitude values but as depicted in fig 28 the nonlinear model response also shows a dangerous behaviour of the system excluding it from operation despite stable dynamics the pendulation amplitudes are still very high based on the results depicted in fig 29 operations carried out beyond resonant cable lengths ensure a significant decrease in amplitude value of payload pendulation and thereby again a stable system dynamic behaviour as can be observed in fig 30 oscillations around the resonant cable length can be a serious threat to operational safety payload angular vibrations within a resonance region are characterised by high amplitude values and even a slight change in lifting cable length in the considered case 0 5m may result in a sudden increase of amplitudes and reaching resonant vibrations moreover as shown in fig 31 the 3 dof model response to the applied excitation confirms the effectiveness of the proposed methodology physical parameters of the model remained unchanged besides the stiffness of a compensating element artificial stiffening of the model allowed modelling dynamic behaviour as in the case of the mathieu s model where the lifting cable is assumed to be rigid as per the analysis conducted in case of the regular wave resulting in ability to capture a parametric resonance while manipulating the system stiffness characteristics by means of changing the compensating element stiffness value a significant influence on its dynamic behaviour can be observed the amplitudes of pendulation angle are attenuated and the resonance rising rate is slower hence the behaviour of the lifted object might be controlled even throughout 1 hr operation this manipulation could not be achieved utilising any of the reference models 6 conclusions concluding the paper it is assumed that the target of introducing a simple but comprehensive model was achieved variety of models encountered in the literature were discussed and were all proven to be overly simplified proposed 3 dof model incorporates the axial oscillation including a compensating element and pendulation with an ability to process a bidirectional excitation this approach as proven within this document allowed to observe the interaction between various excitation directions that were proven to influence the response moreover the presented approach is based on analytical methods what allows for a theoretical numerical or combined analysis model utilises a computed crane tip excitation as a result of vessel motion this is processed using well recognised rao s processing methodology leading to further computational efficiencies it is highlighted that rao s set and the way it was derived cannot in anyway influence the efficiency of the model the proposed model incorporates the algorithm processing the wave parameters rao data to obtain the excitation the model allows for an implementation of a variety of excitation types that provides an ability to study responses to regular wave as well as systematic dynamic responses to irregular wave it needs to be highlighted that the method remains valid within the light lifts category as classified in dnv gl 2017 and proven within this article heavy lifts require coupled analysis introducing additional complexity as briefly described within section 4 in contrast to the proposed 3 dof model the reference models discussed throughout the article do not provide such degree of freedom which allows for an investigation of the models heave response what in fact omits following their axial oscillations only one of them mathieu model allows to apply vertical heave excitation which is responsible for an occurrence of parametric vibrations it proves how important it is to consider the heave excitation when studying and evaluating an amplitude of pendulation angle of lifted objects moreover mathieu model does not involve the lateral direction displacement of the supporting point crane tip lateral excitation which as discovered during the studies has a significant influence on the process of increasing the vibrations amplitude values on the other hand the model recommended by dnv is used only for axial vibrations investigation but does not incorporate the pendulum oscillations studies in addition it also does not include the lateral excitation it should be noted that the models encountered in the literature do not allow to address the compensation for heave and swing motion simultaneously all of these weaknesses are compensated in the model proposed the suggested approach takes into account all of the significant phenomena that might be encountered these are the axial vibrations pendulation coupling between these two an influence of the compensating element and also the bidirectional mutually perpendicular excitation incorporation it is concluded that the proposed model incorporates the most important features of the models popular in the literature and also introduces a significant advantage to the research methodology additionally the proposed model provides processing versatility as it allows for the utilisation of various processing methods time domain spectral and phase plane analysis methods were applied in this paper compatible solutions were obtained but depends on cases different methods led to better effects it is worth highlighting that the mentioned advantages do not compromise the analysis efficiency as reliable and efficient tools are used to process the calculations it was also proven that the proposed model converges well with the results obtained in the commercial software some discrepancies were observed but were generally found negligible as the most important system response parameters remained unchanged it is understood that more sophisticated models exist and that commercial software packages utilised in the industry allow for analysis of an infinite number of degrees of freedom this however is a time consuming process and requires more resource in order to execute thus a simplicity and flexibility of the proposed methodology give an advantage over the other solutions it is suggested that the discussed model is a balanced easily accessible tool between overly simplified ones and highly complex alternatives credit authorship

21948,this paper presents the challenges faced in modelling marine operations with a particular focus on lifting in air those challenges are looked at from a purely modelling perspective showing various approaches encountered in the literature paper further discusses the disadvantages of those models and proposes a 3 dof solution that allows to observe all of the physical phenomena and their possible relation enabling efficient in depth studies of the operations in discussion the proposed model is presented in detail starting from a computation of excitation through the numerical approach

implementation of a variety of excitation types providing an ability to study responses to regular and irregular wave a phenomenon of a parametric resonance was discovered what allows for a reliable assessment of dynamic behaviour emphasising another advantageous feature of the model in comparison to other approaches discussed paper is concluded by a validation of the proposed methodology it is also suggested that the model proposed is a good computationally viable easily accessible balance between overly simple and overly complex models keywords pendulum motion compensation regular and irregular wave excitation offshore lifting modelling offshore lifting operations offshore dynamics parametric resonance detecting capability 1 introduction 1 1 overview increasing exploitation of underwater natural resources triggered rapid development of the offshore industry in the area of modern technologies over the course of last decades one of the challenges in performing activities offshore is naturally the necessity to deal with the surrounding environment the operational intensification with regards to lifting operations is therefore strongly related to the isolation of vibration between the floating object and a lifted payload a solution allowing for reliable performance in difficult weather conditions offers meaningful improvement to the operational expenditure by minimising downtime one of the largest non productive costs that the offshore industry is exposed to several technologies and operational practices have been developed to assist with this but it is believed that the boundaries can still be pushed further a major limitation to trigger a widespread research is an access to an appropriate dynamic modelling tool any lifting operation undertaken offshore consists of several phases depending on the operation characteristics these might include but are not limited to a lift off an object is lifted off from its position b handling in air an object is suspended in air or manoeuvred to the desired position c splash zone crossing an object immersing through a water surface d deep water lowering a payload lowering towards the seabed e seabed landing an object installation onto the seafloor dynamics of the payload in air is mainly driven by the vessel motion with a minor thanks to modern control filters influence of the crane operation resulting payload motion problems are related to two prevailing phenomena heave and pendulum appropriate understanding and control of the payload dynamics might considerably increase the operation efficiency and profitability the purpose of this work is to propose a new balanced approach between variety of currently applied methods being either overly simplified or on the contrary highly complex the authors present a model that incorporates the most important features of the models popular in the literature but also introduces a significant advantage to the research methodology two distinctive features of the proposed 3 dof model are allowing for a detection of system instability and controlling the dynamics by means of changing the system stiffness characteristic the model also provides the ability to investigate the system heave excitation and heave response influence on the pendulum behaviour amongst other aspects the paper will discuss the computation of the kinematic excitation at the crane tip as a result of the ship motions proposed approached utilises rao functions to achieve it as described further in this document at this stage all of the research will be carried out for lifting in air phase to signify the importance of the pendulum motion proposed modelling of the system will allow implementation of compensating stiffness elastic element as an adaptive parameter allowing for system stability analysis and evaluation of its performance the analysis will be performed within the light lift regime by satisfying the criteria stipulated in dnv gl rp n103 modelling and analysis of marine operations dnv gl 2017 and only light lifts will be taken into account this conclusion allows to disregard the payload influence on the vessel dynamic enabling greater efficiency in modelling the ship motions as discussed further in the text 1 2 state of the art many proposals of offshore lifting modelling were found in the literature but most of them present methods of compensation for heave and pendulum separately the book albers 2010 shows the hydraulic based device as the simplest form of a passive heave compensator based on a hydraulic accumulator the presented solution is modelled as a simplified second order linear dynamic model the author also described an active control system which utilises simple feed forward mechanism the same modelling approach was taken in dnv gl 2017 where a dynamic model of a two degree of freedom passive heave compensator is depicted as a simplified second order linear system moving only in the vertical direction the author tong et al 2013 presented a hydraulic arrangement integrated with a reeving system controlled with a plc where the compensation focuses on heave only the system was modelled as a first order linear dynamic model taking into account the stiffness and damping of the compensator another paper kurowski et al 2012 presents a mathematical model of an offshore pedestal crane where the compensating element was referred to as a shock absorber and designed so that it works only under the tension load according to the authors it is characterised by a greater efficiency simpler and more compact construction the aforementioned shock absorber was modelled as a point mass connected to the boom by the means of a spring damper system the problem of compensation of vessel motions induced by waves is also described by szczotka 2010 the author presents a different approach to control where presented compensating system is based on a a frame mounted over the moonpool the considerations concern an in line cross beam mounted compensator the main component responsible for the elimination of the load movement used a special actuator controlled by a digital pid that moved the pulleys and changed the length of the rope controlling the position of the payload the most popular way of compensation is a choice of the right winch drive function such an approach was shown by osiński and wojciech 1998 and fałat 2004 the selection of drives was made by the dynamic optimisation and several proposed solutions were described by tomczyk 2009 all of the discussed papers present a simplified approach to modelling of axial motion of payload uncoupling the pendulation it seems to be too much of a simplification especially in cases analysed for resonant states scientific research regarding the subject of a pendulum motion compensation can also be found in literature although they are much rarer the reason may be that the pendulum swing motion attenuation is more difficult to achieve than a compensation for heave this makes the subject particularly worth of interest additionally operational measures were introduced to reduce the pendulation risk often with avoiding operations in certain conditions specifically in regular swell seas those measures became industry standard but despite general acceptance weather windows could be maximised should another reliable solution be found the article fragopoulos et al 1999 examines the problems of controlling the load sway during offshore lifting operations the kinematic model of a vessel and a crane with an anti pendulation arm attached are presented the whole system forms a double pendulum the model consists of a control arm attached with one end to the crane tip and the other to the lifting cable linearised model engages linear quadratic gaussian control lqg and generalised predictive control methods in the article of balachandran et al 1999 the authors proposed a concept of a mechanical filter to attenuate the pendulum oscillations the idea is based on actively controlled pivot point around which the suspended load moves ship roll induced vibrations are considered only two active ship motion compensation methods of payload sway stabilisation during operations are discussed by schaub 2008 a double layer sliding manifold for offshore container crane occ is presented in the paper of sun et al 2017 to enable the position tracking and sway control simultaneously the model for the occ consists of a ship crane trolley payload system the described model is characterised by the varying length of the wire and the sway angle of the lifted object the authors underline its improved performance against a conventional controller the weak point of the conducted analysis might be a lack of examination of a heave response of the studied model and its impact on the analysed pendulation angle a similar model is proposed by the authors ngo and hong 2012 where it is considered as a three dimensional system the author masoud 2000 and masoud et al 2004 shows a possibility of reducing sway motion by controlling the slew and luff angles of the boom according to the paper such control might be achieved with heavy equipment already being part of the crane so that rebuilding of existing cranes would require smaller effort additionally parametric excitation studies were encountered the article of witz 1995 presents the research on time domain model demonstrating the effect of irregular waves on crane loads causing the parametric excitation all of the mentioned articles do not consider simultaneous action and compensation for heave which seems to be a weakness of current approaches especially in the case of large system displacements 2 theoretical analysis 2 1 the dynamics of the lifted object as per dnv gl standard for certification no 2 22 lifting appliance dnv gl 2011 the vertical loads due to floating unit motions appearing at the crane tip and hence on the lifting payload should be taken into consideration by multiplying the working load by a dynamic amplification factor ψ the daf was evaluated to cover all inertia forces and shock the dynamic amplification factor can be assessed by 1 ψ 1 v r k w g where k geometric stiffness coefficient referred to hook position defined as a force at hook to produce unit deflection at hook kn m g standard acceleration of gravity 9 81 m s2 w working load kn m v r relative velocity m s between the payload and hook at the time of pick up considering the above formula the load on the crane wire during offshore lifting is then equal to the dynamic load which is the working load multiplied by the daf and is expressed as follows 2 f d w ψ w 1 v r k w g considering above one might notice that the reduction in the dynamic load can be achieved by a the reduction in relative velocity leading to a reduction of the operating window b reduction in working load or c adjustment in stiffness coefficient reduction performed by a or b lowers the productivity of offshore operations alternatively by applying a spring with adaptive stiffness into the model an adjustment in the k value would be possible that would directly lead to the decrease of the dynamic loads imposed on the lifted object and the crane 2 2 analysis of reference models in the vast majority of offshore technical solutions the executive system is being hydraulically actuated the principle of work of the hydraulic systems is based on a hydraulic cylinder connection with a piston type accumulator the accumulator also has a function of separating the hydraulic part of the cylinder from the gas bottles filled with nitrogen the combination of both forms a mechanism in which the volume of the attached gas accumulators sets the stiffness of the system a simplified dynamic system of a passive heave compensator according to dnv gl rp n103 modelling and analysis of marine operations dnv gl 2017 might be simplistically modelled by the following system where x 1 t x a s i n ω t vertical displacement at crane tip created by a kinematic excitation m m c mass of heave compensator kg m o mass of lifted object kg k c stiffness of heave compensator n m k w wire stiffness n m e modulus of elasticity pa a nominal cross sectional area of cable m2 l length of cable m c c viscous damping of heave compensator n s m the equations of motion for the simplified model might be then expressed as follows 3 m c 0 0 m 0 x c x 0 c c 0 0 0 x c x 0 k c k w k w k w k w x c x 0 c c x 1 k c x 1 0 another popular and well established case in literature for the modelling of suspended objects exposed to the influence of sea waves is a model of a single or double pendulum in literature sources it is challenging to find any proposals of systems that could directly correspond to the model proposed by the authors of this study which was intentionally designed to fit the operations performed by offshore column cranes the authors fragopoulos et al 1999 ngo and hong 2012 and sun et al 2017 mentioned in 1 2 present systems that compensate ship motions analysed as double or single pendulum models depending on the implemented compensating element 3 proposed model given the extensive simplifications in approaches mentioned above it is suggested to consider a model combining the features of both it is highlighted that the proposed model shown on figs 2 and 4 considers planar motion only at this stage precise analytical description of ships motion requires consideration of two types of motion on the sea waves the first type has a linear character and is described by the following three movements heave sway and surge the second one describes three angular movements determined by yaw roll and pitch which are respectively vertical transverse and longitudinal oscillations of the floating unit under the influence of waves a floating vessel will produce a rocking motion affecting its buoyancy 3 1 excitation modelling as mentioned the investigations conducted were focused on light lifts as per classification from dnv gl 2017 according to this code objects that weigh less than 1 2 of the vessel s displacement estimated to be less than a few hundred tons do not alter its motion characteristic this assumption allowed coupled dynamic analyses to be disregarded and utilise response amplitude operators and phases often referred to as raos in order to obtain the excitation functions raos are an output of diffraction radiation analysis carried out on floating objects floating units are considered to be continuous systems which are subjected to a complex motion characteristics being a composition of a rigid body motion and its vibration in most practical cases naval designs are stiff enough to omit elastic properties of the entire vessel in analytical considerations it allows to adopt the simple model of a rigid body which is described by 6 degrees of freedom such an approach allows the hydrodynamic forces to be represented as a hydrodynamic added mass fluid damping and restoring forces hence the considered case will be modelled by the following matrix equation 4 m v a ω x ω dir c v ω x ω dir k v x ω dir f ω dir the mass term is modified with the implementation of a frequency dependent function which is the hydrodynamic added mass a ω and the final form of the vessel mass matrix will be given as m v a ω the k v is the considered vessel stiffness matrix related to its hydrostatic stability a detailed description of the remaining symbols used is given as follows m v mass matrix of the vessel a ω hydrodynamic added mass c v hydrodynamic damping matrix k v vessel stiffness matrix f ω dir hydrodynamic force vector ω natural frequency dir wave direction the solution of the governing equation 4 for the resulting motion raos where x ω dir r a o ω dir is given by the relation presented in 5 see fig 3 5 r a o ω dir f ω dir ω 2 m v a ω i ω c v ω k v 1 system being described by the relationship given in 4 is composed of 6 second order differential equations what implies 6 linear independent eigenvectors and corresponding eigenvalues an origin of the assumed coordinate frame is placed at the centre of floatation cof in general it cannot be assumed to be the same as a centroid cog of the vessel it causes that motion of cog is a composition of the particular motions due to its eigenmodes in practice at least two or three natural frequencies will be visible at raos spectra raos can take different forms but are most often represented as a direction dependent displacement response per metre wave versus the wave period the raos amplitude depicts a motion amplitude per unit amplitude of wave the raos phase lag represents the phase difference between vessel motion and the waves separate raos are naturally computed for each degree of freedom raos functions can be obtained by the formula 4 or by an application of dedicated computational systems another possibility is to use the empirical data obtained during experimental investigation of the real object but this manner is expensive time consuming and available only for the existing units alternatively the raos can be obtained through a scaled model testing regardless the method used to obtain the raos a numerical set of data including the phase and direction information is obtained what needs to be emphasised geometric properties and the method of establishing raos will to an extent have an influence over the results but will not affect the performance of the model proposed within this text the remote point response spectrum or its specified point are used as an input for calculations of irregular and regular waving respectively and then to establish kinetic and potential energies by computations of displacements and velocities of the system elements that implies a different vessel would change only numerical values of the results but would not compromise the algorithm suitability and effectiveness it is one of the most important advantages of the proposed model to eliminate the necessity to perform computationally expensive hydrodynamic computations ability to adopt raos for computing the excitation enables the methodology to be economically viable within industrial research environment this significantly reduces the effort of modelling the marine operations the method fathom group ltd 2018 journée and massie 2001 used for derivation of the crane tip motions applied basic geometrical properties and a complex signal adding method allowing for both amplitude and phase information to be added correctly and processed further into the harmonic excitation functions excitation motions were calculated at the remote point representing a position of the crane tip small angle approximation was used based on the assumption of the limited operational pitch and roll angles translations due to rotation of the vessel were obtained using the complex map 6 and summed with the global translations 6 δ ω l c t i j k a y e i ϕ y a r e i ϕ r a p e i ϕ p z c t y c t x c t e i ω t where i j k unit vectors a n n motion amplitude

individual rotations about their respective component axes 3 2 analytical analysis to simplify the analytical description of a complex ship motion model some assumptions were adopted at the preliminary stage of modelling and only the most important dependencies were used for the derivation of the equations of motion the following assumptions were implemented in the model a the payload motion was considered in yz plane including three degrees of freedom linear heave for the object and the compensator and the angular pendulum of the system b the payload was treated as a material point c the excitation for the base movement was calculated based on the assumptions described in 3 1 this allowed the crane tip to be excited kinematically d the executive element of the compensator was modelled as a spring having stiffness within a specified range e as the considerations concern only lifting in air phase the lifting cable was modelled as a massless element with a specified length and stiffness the purpose of introducing simplifying assumptions seems to be justified and allows a preliminary model to be obtained allowing for the study of the lifting dynamics using simple analytical methods the work performed at this stage allowed for a development of a three degrees of freedom dynamic model of a crane tip equipped with a lifting cable with length dependent stiffness mass and stiffness of the compensator and also mass of the payload the model was prepared so that it allows for an adjustment of the compensator stiffness the proposed 3 dof dynamic model is presented

the figs 1 and 4 3 3 numerical simulations environment the dynamic model considered in the paper is described by three ordinary differential equations of a second order in order to perform numerical simulations the equations were transformed into the first order form the obtained results provide basic information about the dynamic behaviour of the system the sagemath environment sagemath org 2019 was used to conduct the numerical simulations sagemath formerly sage from software for algebra and geometry experimentation is a computer algebra system cas which is a common platform of many advanced tools and programming libraries created to support complex mathematical calculations the authors of the study decided to implement the whole simulation studies in sagemath as it seems to be convenient in its functionality allowing to perform either symbolic or numerical operations the entire program was written in the scripting language python the utilised python based program consists of free libraries only and is distributed under the gnu gpl this gives the possibility of a completely free use for private and commercial purposes the presented advantages make the sagemath environment an interesting alternative to commercial software packages such as mathematica or matlab the ordinary differential equations were solved using the lsoda from the fortran library odepack the utilised method switches automatically between the non stiff adams and the stiff bdf method this procedure is characterised by a satisfactory speed and accuracy numerical simulations of the investigated systems were carried out and discussed in the following section the model itself is subjected to further investigation and verification activities 4 model validation a building block of the proposed method was to introduce a vessel payload decoupled response assumption this was achieved by following the recommendation in dnv gl 2017 and restricting the method to be used within the light lifts regime to ensure validity the authors have conducted numerical analysis taking into account 6 degrees of freedom related to the vessel motion these 6 dofs provide the linear and angular vessel motions directly coupling the two considered systems an initial model developed by the authors has given satisfactory confirmation of the referenced assumption the following three cases were considered by the authors a comparative analysis of the 9 dof model response vessel payload response against the 3 dof model payload response proposed in the article in which the vessel excitation is based on rao s processing methodology b comparative analysis of the payload and vessel response for two vessels of different seakeeping properties c comparative analysis of the payload and vessel response for a number of different payload masses the considerations concern one dimensional forward propagating waves as a vessel excitation the performed tests and results of some of the considered cases are reported for reference fig 5 presents the pendulation amplitude of the object suspended from the crane boom tip excited by the coupled vessel motions for the considered forward propagating excitation wave wave period t 7s the crane tip excitation amplitudes are of the following values lateral tip displacement a y 0 5m vertical tip displacement a z 1 5m which correspond to the excitation amplitudes considered in the 3 dof model payload response simulations presented in fig 15 comparing the results obtained utilising the rao s processing methodology it was observed that the payload response is identical confirming the method s validity for the given mass relationship regime this validation of assumptions allowed time histories to be prepared of the rao changes for a complex model of the vessel payload system see figs 6 and 7 the obtained results show a regular motion of the crane boom tip the frequency amplitude and phase shift are the same as computed with rao s within the accuracy of numerical errors it allows the conclusion that the vessel dynamic properties are transferred through the rao s affecting payload dynamics no additional effects were observed allowing for the claim of ship lifted object coupling for the vessel payload mass ratio regime in consideration it confirms the authors assumption and shows that the methodology based on rao s can be successfully and efficiently used for uncoupled models additionally five subsequent masses up to 2 of total ship displacement as adopted from reference mentioned were considered results of the investigation are depicted in figs 8 10 as spectra obtained by utilisation of fourier analysis in order to enable clearer presentation of the results based on the results provided it might be stated that the frequency structure of payload vibrations is of a different character and is fully independent to vessel heave and pitch oscillations in depth analysis allows for an observation of low frequencies components being revealed in each spectrum but they are of zero amplitudes and are clearly negligible in a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the results the obtained results revealed that there is no significant influence of payload weight on the system frequency structure for the considered mass regime critical harmonic components do not change their position even for limit value of lifted object mass amplitude of dynamic response is marginally lower for the heavier objects but it does not have a meaningful invalidating impact on the proposed methodology higher harmonic components are shifted relative to the reference position but the changes are small and outside of resonance range hence these elements can be omitted in the analysis it was concluded that the assumed simplification is correct and allows the replacement of coupled analysis with the floating vessel rao without raising significant modelling errors payload mass to ship displacement ratios above 2 have also been checked the expected discrepancy in quantitative measures was observed immediately past the threshold value while qualitative divergence between the two methods started to appear at 2 5 in order to validate the proposed mathematical model and hence simulation results the authors of the study decided to involve also the world s leading commercial software package orcaflex software is used for the dynamic analysis of offshore marine systems the orcaflex model was prepared so that the conditions from the discussed analytical model were accurately replicated to examine specific parameters of the models appropriate tests were performed in both environments independently the extracted results from the orcaflex model were a vertical displacement for both of the masses and the sway angle of the system a created model enabled the implantation of the excitation in the kinematic form in two independent directions the authors modelled the wire rope as several massless 2 node elements this corresponds to the model used in the analytical model as per assumptions stipulated earlier in the text the lifting wire was separated to 3 distinct segments a winch element allowing for the controlled length adjustment modelled with the same properties as the lifting wire b main lifting wire element with a fixed length c compensator length element with a negligible stiffness allowing for the incorporation of the compensator element the compensator was represented as a link spanning through a length of the appropriate part of the lifting wire this allowed close control of the stiffness parameter of the compensator and enabled post processing of the desired results compensator mass was attached as a clump weight at the geometric centre of the element in its unstretched length the object was represented as a lumped mass using the 6d buoy element all geometric environmental elastic and rotational properties were neglected at this stage the vessel was set to harmonic motions that only relate directly to the excitation derivation methodology described in 3 1 the study on the orcaflex model allowed comparison of the results with previously performed simulations the comparative results are depicted below analysing the presented figures it can be concluded that the obtained results correspond to the proposed mathematical model discussed in the previous section the results show that the numerical output of the authors dynamics equations and the software are consistent however in figs 11 and 12 some discrepancies between the obtained waveforms might be observed this may be the result of utilisation of different integration methods the orcaflex package orcina ltd 2019 implements two complementary time domain dynamic integration schemes which are an explicit and implicit both of them re compute the system geometry at each time step so that the simulation takes into account all geometric non linearities including the spatial variation of contact and wave loads while the integration scheme implemented by the authors solves a system of ordinary differential equations using lsoda from the fortran library odepack described briefly in 3 3 another reason for that inaccuracy might be the existence of a numerical damping in the integration scheme used in the commercial software for finite element models as they may contain false high frequency response the generalised α integration scheme utilised in orcaflex package is based on a controllable numerical damping which removes artificial high frequency response a much more stable convergence is achieved when numerical damping is implemented into the integration scheme the generalised α integration scheme uses a built in value of 0 4 that according to the software creators was chosen to provide fast simulation run time without compromising its accuracy nevertheless the obtained results might be considered as consistent since the important characteristics remains unchanged proving the validity of the proposed model 5 comparative analysis of the encountered models against the 3 dof model based on the available literature models the authors prepared reference models that allowed comparison of the proposed methodology to the existing ones considerations regarding literature models as in the case of the analysed system were reduced to the analysis of the dynamics of the in plane motion by the implementation of the simplifying assumptions described in 3 2 for analysis purposes the authors proposed two comparative models the first system was modelled on the basis of ngo and hong 2012 and sun et al 2017 as a single pendulum where an excitation was incorporated as an angular roll acting in the yz model plane only the lifted object was modelled as a point mass suspended at the end of pendulum it is worth noting that the reference literature model does not take into account the stiffness characteristics of the system neither the stiffness of the crane nor of the cable that are both crucial when considering lifting operations the crane stiffness should be considered during a variety of lifting phases as it may lead to a change in the system s natural frequency it is understood that with an increase in the cable length crane stiffness becomes less significant in the equivalent system stiffness the second proposed model to study dynamics of the oscillating motion system was the mathieu model being a representation of the simplest model of parametric vibrations besides of vertical heave of the pendulum model moving support the excitation was also given in a lateral direction by the roll angle as in the reference literature model dimensionless form of the mathieu model governing equation is presented in formula 14 as follows 14 φ τ ω 0 2 1 ϵ c o s τ φ τ 0 where τ dimensionless time ω 0 natural frequency ϵ modulation index dynamics of payload sway motion for the simplified models of a mathematical pendulum with moving support was analysed for both cases and compared against the dynamics of the proposed 3 dof model a series of simulations were performed to study the behaviour of the models discussed 5 1 simulations data for a fully comprehensive study of the proposed 3 dof model two types of a wave excitation were applied a regular and irregular wave the parameters presented in table 1 were used in simulations utilising the excitation of regular waving to enable more comprehensive model evaluation studies were also conducted in irregular waves derived based on jonswap spectra theory provided by dnv gl 2018 or dnv gl 2017 and calculated for the specified wave parameters frequency and direction irregular random waves reflecting a real sea state can be represented as a summation of sinusoidal wave components with a random phases based on jonswap spectra an empirical relationship between the distribution of the energy by frequency allows to obtain a reliable representation of a sea state in fig 13 the raos utilised to establish the crane tip excitation are presented and the corresponding wave parameters depicted within the label 5 2 results and discussion numerical simulations were performed for the three analysed models as described in the preceding sections nevertheless it should be noted that the models proposed in the literature do not investigate the compensation for heave and swing motion simultaneously hence a direct comparison is somehow limited also the stiffness considerations seem to have a significant influence on the dynamics of the systems and simulation results the results as shown in figs 14 25 are provided together for a comparison as the reference models do not include the analysis of a vertical displacement of the payload the comprehensive comparison cannot be fully accomplished but the results for the pendulum angle of each model were depicted and are discussed below the comparison was carried out by adjusting the stiffness so that the simulation results of the 3 dof model match the reference ones for the sensitivity analysis of the proposed model heave excitation was first set to 0 to allow for a direct comparison in author s understanding it is one of the biggest issues with the reference models as heave motion is unavoidable in offshore operations further stages of the models comparison were performed by gradually increasing the heave excitation in the proposed model side way excitation was kept the same this shown how quickly the pendulum response deviates from the heaveless model fig 14 shows influence of vertical amplitudes of tip oscillations on payload sway angle vibration frequency was set equal to subharmonic critical frequency of parametric resonance different values of heave a z and constant values of roll a y magnitude were taken into account as expected higher heave excitation amplitudes led to an increase in the payload angular vibration amplitude it also became apparent and proven how important it is to consider the heave excitation when studying and evaluating an amplitude of pendulation angle of lifted objects to emphasise the phenomenon and the payload sway response the simulations were performed for a calculated parametric resonance cable length being within the operational range for high amplitude of heave excitation for 7 s wave period medium slow waves vibration frequency was set equal to subharmonic critical frequency of parametric resonance for each of cases the authors conducted two simulations enabling a direct comparison between the discussed models in each of the figs 15 and 16 three dynamic responses of the analysed systems obtained for the same magnitudes of excitation amplitudes are presented physical parameters of the models were set equal besides the stiffness of the compensating element in the proposed 3 dof model in fig 15 the compensator stiffness was set an order of magnitude higher than for the simulation results depicted in fig 16 artificial stiffening of the 3 dof model allowed to achieve the same simulation results as in the case of the mathieu model where the cable is assumed to be rigid in fig 16 when the stiffness characteristics of the 3 dof model was changed by means of a compensator stiffness value it can be observed that manipulation of system stiffness characteristics which is equivalent to changing the length of the cable has a significant influence on the dynamic behaviour the amplitudes of pendulation angle for the proposed model are then much smaller and even if the resonance is likely to occur its raising rate is much slower and the reached amplitudes much smaller from fig 17 it can be stated that for all of the analysed models when considering stiffened 3 dof model an occurrence of main resonance can be well predicted analysis of figs 17 and 18 in comparison to 20 and 22 when simulations were run for idealised regular wave scenario generated using raos allows to conclude that oscillations with natural frequency are important only for high values of vertical displacements moreover it can be concluded that even small value of surge sway can lead to a change of the resonance type as depicted in fig 18 the model with reduced stiffness is limiting the amplitudes of pendulation even for resonant frequencies results being compatible with fig 18 can be obtained from the analysis of phase portrait presented in fig 19 resonance behaviour is visible as unstable spirals which are tending to infinity stable vibrations are connected with the limited curve figs 20 and 22 present simulations performed for a resonant cable length for idealised regular wave scenario generated using raos in comparison to figs 15 and 16 where the amplitude values of heave a z and roll a y were opposite and a little bit higher it can be observed that parametric resonance is caused by heave of a crane tip however lateral displacement of the crane tip has an important role in the process of an amplitude increase phase portraits depicted in figs 21 and 23 show similar information resonance pendulation caused by vertical tip displacements has a form of deformed unstable spirals additional loop in the central position of portrait is connected with higher harmonics of the solution it does not affect on the system stability regardless the method used to analyse it can be stated that even for small values of its lateral amplitude the resonant raising rate is higher parametric resonance is important in case of regular waves with period about 6 7 s as in the previously discussed cases the change in stiffness of the 3 dof system through the rigidity of the compensator leads to a limitation of the sway amplitudes of the payload it is especially visible at phase portrait shown in fig 23 utilisation of the lower stiffness enable of the compensator leads to a significant change of trajectories resonance behaviour with growing trajectories is replaced with the limited curve which means stable dynamics because of significant simplifications adopted in the reference models e g rigid cable omitted influence of heave simulations conducted for resonance beyond cable length for idealised regular wave scenario shown that the non linear model is limiting the amplitudes of pendulation even for close values of resonant frequencies fig 24 this implies that the system should be stable but high displacements are still present in fig 25 it can be seen that by a change in stiffness of added compensator the dynamic response of the proposed system is characterised by the higher vibration frequency but at the same time achieves only half of the amplitude of payload pendulation analysis conducted on the basis of simulations carried out for each model leads towards relevant conclusions a big disadvantage of the reference models is aforementioned in 2 2 disregarded stiffness of individual components of a system the omission of the stiffness of the crane structure while assuming a lifting cable as a rigid rod leads to changes in the dynamics of the system resulting in changes in its natural frequency when considering a lifting in air phase short cable length results in the high stiffness of the system however along with the payload lowering i e unwinding the lifting cable continuous changes in the rigidity of the whole system occur which certainly affect the dynamics of the analysed model introducing into the 3 dof model an additional compensatorspring allowed to examine how changes in its stiffness affect the amplitudes of angle pendulation of the payload the research led to interesting observations it can be concluded that manipulations in the stiffness of the compensating element lead to a change in the total stiffness characteristics of the system and thus the length between crane tip and payload this in turn leads to a limitation of the amplitude of the payload sway angle changing the rigidity of the system therefore leads to a change and limitation of the angle of pendulation which can be achieved for example through varying the cable length over time the ability to analyse the key vertical displacement of a hanging mass due to heave motion is essential to conduct a fully comprehensive study of the dynamic behaviour of objects during lifting operations all these weaknesses are compensated in the model proposed by the authors of this article as discussed irregular wave studies were also conducted for comprehensiveness fig 26 shows the proposed real sea state excitation obtained from raos depicted in fig 13 after inverse fast fourier transformation in order to assess the proposed model validity the authors expanded the validation database and prepared a number of numerical simulations for irregular wave case all of the obtained results are presented in figs 27 31 as can be seen in figs 27 and 28 even a linear analysis allows to assess resonance occurrence regions reliably and possibly prevent the system from hazardous operations for the specified lifting cable lengths naturally the nonlinear model reflects the real behaviour of the system more truthfully despite limitation of amplitude values but as depicted in fig 28 the nonlinear model response also shows a dangerous behaviour of the system excluding it from operation despite stable dynamics the pendulation amplitudes are still very high based on the results depicted in fig 29 operations carried out beyond resonant cable lengths ensure a significant decrease in amplitude value of payload pendulation and thereby again a stable system dynamic behaviour as can be observed in fig 30 oscillations around the resonant cable length can be a serious threat to operational safety payload angular vibrations within a resonance region are characterised by high amplitude values and even a slight change in lifting cable length in the considered case 0 5m may result in a sudden increase of amplitudes and reaching resonant vibrations moreover as shown in fig 31 the 3 dof model response to the applied excitation confirms the effectiveness of the proposed methodology physical parameters of the model remained unchanged besides the stiffness of a compensating element artificial stiffening of the model allowed modelling dynamic behaviour as in the case of the mathieu s model where the lifting cable is assumed to be rigid as per the analysis conducted in case of the regular wave resulting in ability to capture a parametric resonance while manipulating the system stiffness characteristics by means of changing the compensating element stiffness value a significant influence on its dynamic behaviour can be observed the amplitudes of pendulation angle are attenuated and the resonance rising rate is slower hence the behaviour of the lifted object might be controlled even throughout 1 hr operation this manipulation could not be achieved utilising any of the reference models 6 conclusions concluding the paper it is assumed that the target of introducing a simple but comprehensive model was achieved variety of models encountered in the literature were discussed and were all proven to be overly simplified proposed 3 dof model incorporates the axial oscillation including a compensating element and pendulation with an ability to process a bidirectional excitation this approach as proven within this document allowed to observe the interaction between various excitation directions that were proven to influence the response moreover the presented approach is based on analytical methods what allows for a theoretical numerical or combined analysis model utilises a computed crane tip excitation as a result of vessel motion this is processed using well recognised rao s processing methodology leading to further computational efficiencies it is highlighted that rao s set and the way it was derived cannot in anyway influence the efficiency of the model the proposed model incorporates the algorithm processing the wave parameters rao data to obtain the excitation the model allows for an implementation of a variety of excitation types that provides an ability to study responses to regular wave as well as systematic dynamic responses to irregular wave it needs to be highlighted that the method remains valid within the light lifts category as classified in dnv gl 2017 and proven within this article heavy lifts require coupled analysis introducing additional complexity as briefly described within section 4 in contrast to the proposed 3 dof model the reference models discussed throughout the article do not provide such degree of freedom which allows for an investigation of the models heave response what in fact omits following their axial oscillations only one of them mathieu model allows to apply vertical heave excitation which is responsible for an occurrence of parametric vibrations it proves how important it is to consider the heave excitation when studying and evaluating an amplitude of pendulation angle of lifted objects moreover mathieu model does not involve the lateral direction displacement of the supporting point crane tip lateral excitation which as discovered during the studies has a significant influence on the process of increasing the vibrations amplitude values on the other hand the model recommended by dnv is used only for axial vibrations investigation but does not incorporate the pendulum oscillations studies in addition it also does not include the lateral excitation it should be noted that the models encountered in the literature do not allow to address the compensation for heave and swing motion simultaneously all of these weaknesses are compensated in the model proposed the suggested approach takes into account all of the significant phenomena that might be encountered these are the axial vibrations pendulation coupling between these two an influence of the compensating element and also the bidirectional mutually perpendicular excitation incorporation it is concluded that the proposed model incorporates the most important features of the models popular in the literature and also introduces a significant advantage to the research methodology additionally the proposed model provides processing versatility as it allows for the utilisation of various processing methods time domain spectral and phase plane analysis methods were applied in this paper compatible solutions were obtained but depends on cases different methods led to better effects it is worth highlighting that the mentioned advantages do not compromise the analysis efficiency as reliable and efficient tools are used to process the calculations it was also proven that the proposed model converges well with the results obtained in the commercial software some discrepancies were observed but were generally found negligible as the most important system response parameters remained unchanged it is understood that more sophisticated models exist and that commercial software packages utilised in the industry allow for analysis of an infinite number of degrees of freedom this however is a time consuming process and requires more resource in order to execute thus a simplicity and flexibility of the proposed methodology give an advantage over the other solutions it is suggested that the discussed model is a balanced easily accessible tool between overly simplified ones and highly complex alternatives credit authorship

21949,the introduction of eedi raised the need for norming standardising of ship s manoeuvrability under adverse conditions besides the necessary criteria measures and standards developed in several research projects and described elsewhere also procedures and methods for the practical evaluation of the proposed criteria in design and regulatory approval are required which are addressed in this paper the idea is to develop a flexible assessment framework ranging from advanced assessment procedures necessary in cases with large uncertainties and near the acceptance boundary to simple procedures which are sufficient for the majority of conventional vessels the paper outlines the background of three levels of assessment procedures and describes in detail possible approaches towards level 2 and level 1 assessment procedures for propulsion and steering criteria the proposed assessment procedures require definition of multiple input components time average wave induced forces and moments wind forces calm water reactions rudder induced forces and propeller characteristics the paper discusses the availability of different methods experimental numerical or empirical for these components and besides proposes and validates several simple empirical formulae developed specifically for the simplified assessment to further reduce its complexity keywords manoeuvrability in adverse conditions criteria standards regulations 1 introduction the following terminology is used in the paper the term criterion refers to a characteristic of the ship such as ability to turn keep course etc by which ship s abilities relevant for the considered problem are judged a corresponding measure e g turning diameter or overshoot angle quantifies the ship s performance with respect to the considered criterion for manoeuvrability in adverse conditions a convenient and popular measure is the marginal maximum severity of seaway i e maximum wave height and corresponding wind speed up to which the ship can fulfil the criterion the term standard sometimes called norm refers to the acceptance limit of this measure to qualify the ship as fulfilling the corresponding criterion here the standard is the specified significant wave height and the related wind force manoeuvrability of ships is presently specified by the rules of classification societies ship owner requirements and non mandatory but gaining increasing acceptance by administrations and classification societies imo standards for ship manoeuvrability imo 2002 the latter address turning initial turning yaw checking course keeping and emergence stopping abilities which are evaluated in simple standard manoeuvres in calm water these standards have been criticized for not addressing ship manoeuvring characteristics at limited speed in restricted areas and in adverse weather conditions see e g quadvlieg and van coevorden 2008 the importance of the latter aspect increased after the introduction of the energy efficiency design index eedi which raised concerns see e g imo 2010 that some ship designers will achieve eedi requirements by simple reducing the installed power which may lead to insufficient manoeuvrability in heavy weather see discussion in shigunov 2018 to solve this problem rational criteria measures and standards are required which concern propulsion and steering abilities of ships in adverse conditions these issues are summarised below and addressed in detail elsewhere see imo 2012a b shigunov and papanikolaou 2015 and shigunov 2017 2018 the aim of this paper is to discuss assessment procedures that can be used for the evaluation of the proposed criteria in practical design and approval work by iacs on minimum power requirements for manoeuvrability in adverse weather conditions led to the development of two criteria a course keeping criterion which requires that the ship should be able to keep course in waves and wind from any direction and a propulsion criterion which requires that the ship should be able to keep advance speed of at least 4 0 knots in waves and wind from any direction imo 2012a c for practical evaluation of these criteria iacs proposed three assessment levels the most accurate comprehensive assessment level 3 allows the best accuracy by solving three nonlinear motion equations to evaluate separately propulsion and steering criteria the simplified assessment level 2 still considers the physics of the problem but uses a reduced number of assessment scenarios and reduced complexity of equations the idea of the simplified steering ability assessment in imo 2012a c was to replace the steering ability assessment in seaway from any direction by propulsion assessment in head seaway at a specifically defined forward speed which replaces model tests or numerical simulations in waves and wind from all directions with simpler tests or simulations in head waves only to achieve this simplification the required ship speed in the propulsion assessment v ck was defined in such a way that the fulfilment of propulsion requirement in head seaway at this speed automatically fulfils the course keeping requirement in any seaway direction the definition of v ck as a function of the rudder area and ship windage areas was derived empirically using results of comprehensive assessment for several ships a comparison of the marginal significant wave heights obtained directly from the evaluation of the steering ability criterion with the marginal significant wave heights obtained from the evaluation of the propulsion ability criterion at the maximum of two forward speeds v s max 4 knots v ck in fig 1 shows a good correlation but also that the formula for v ck is in general not conservative level 1 the simplest assessment procedure in imo 2012a c is an empirical formula defining the required installed power as a function of deadweight minimum power line mpl the follow up discussion at imo led to a revision of level 1 removal of comprehensive assessment due to the absence of methods for the components required in this assessment and relaxing of standards wave heights in the simplified assessment and resulted in the 2013 interim guidelines for determining minimum propulsion power to maintain the manoeuvrability of ship in adverse conditions imo 2013 updated in imo 2014 2015 thus the presently acting guidelines include level 1 assessment mpl and simplified propulsion assessment which implements both the propulsion ability and steering ability criteria the latter indirectly through v ck speed the project shopera conducted a review of existing regulations interviews of ship masters and detailed accident investigations in shigunov 2017 as well as accident statistics in ventikos et al 2015 to identify relevant scenarios criteria and corresponding standards this led to the identification of three scenarios open sea coastal areas and restricted areas at limited speed each of which requires specific criteria shigunov and papanikolaou 2015 for the open sea scenario the weather vaning ability criterion was proposed the ship should be able to keep heading in head to bow quartering seaway up to 60 off bow a similar heading recovery criterion was proposed in imo 2016b where it means the ability of the ship to turn from beam into head seaway the formulation in imo 2016b is much more difficult to evaluate in practice since it requires model tests or numerical simulations of transient manoeuvres in irregular waves and wind note also that weather vaning in bow seaways is rather a propulsion than steering problem inability to complete a turn in bow seaway is always related to insufficient propulsion ability unlike steering in beam or stern quartering seaways imo 2016b confirms this since the results weakly depend on manoeuvring characteristics of the hull and rudder for manoeuvring in coastal waters the following two criteria were proposed in shigunov and papanikolaou 2015 steering ability ship s ability to perform any manoeuvre in seaway from any direction and propulsion ability ship s ability to maintain a specified speed in seaway from any direction the required speed in the propulsion criterion was increased compared to imo 2013 2014 2015 from 4 knots to 6 knots to consider possible strong currents in coastal areas because the ability to perform any manoeuvre is impossible to evaluate in practice an equivalent but easier to evaluate steering ability criterion was formulated as the ship should be able to overcome environmental forces to start or continue course change in seaway from any direction the third scenario manoeuvring at limited speed in restricted areas concerning situations where the forward speed and thus the applied engine power must be reduced significantly below attainable due to navigational restrictions e g during approaching to or entering ports navigation in channels and rivers etc led in shigunov and papanikolaou 2015 to the following criteria course keeping at a specified low speed in strong wind in shallow water in shallow water near a bank and in shallow water during overtaking by a quicker ship in shigunov 2016 2018 it was shown that ships satisfying the propulsion and steering criteria in coastal waters satisfy the weather vaning requirements in the open sea with a sufficiently high probability thus the assessment for the open sea scenario is unnecessary note also that in the third scenario the full available power cannot be applied therefore this scenario is not affected by the eedi requirements and is not considered here therefore shopera proposed in imo 2016a the steering ability and propulsion ability criteria for coastal waters as a basis for the minimum requirements for manoeuvrability in adverse conditions related to the installed power see shigunov 2018 for a detailed discussion of scenarios criteria and corresponding environmental conditions in this paper the aspects of the practical evaluation of the proposed criteria are addressed for the practical evaluation of the proposed criteria shopera proposed level 1 2 and 3 assessment procedures each separately for the propulsion ability and steering ability criteria besides the project spent significant efforts to develop methods for the definition of the components required for the comprehensive and simplified assessments see imo 2016a for overview and below for more details in the proposal for revised guidelines concerning bulk carriers and tankers imo 2017a b jointly prepared by shopera and the jasnaoe coordinated research project in japan mpl from imo 2013 2014 2015 are adopted as level 1 the propulsion ability criterion is evaluated using the simplified assessment procedure and the steering ability criterion is dropped thus the proposal in imo 2017a contains simplified assessment level 2 for the propulsion criterion and mpl level 1 2 comprehensive assessment compliance with the standards imo 2002 is demonstrated in full scale trials which is impossible for the assessment of manoeuvrability in adverse weather conditions direct evaluation of the proposed criteria in transient model experiments with self propelled ship models in simulated irregular waves and wind for all required combinations of wave directions and periods is unfeasible for several reasons first interpretation of transient manoeuvres in seaway as safe or unsafe is not always possible especially in marginal cases i e cases near the failure boundary which are of interest in approval second results of such tests strongly depend on the time history of steering which causes too large variability and uncertainty of test results i e such tests cannot be reliably verified third reliable statistical predictions in irregular seaway require repetition of tests in multiple long realisations of each seaway which is too expensive fourth very few facilities exist worldwide able to perform such tests which makes such tests impractical for routine design and approval finally verification of such tests by regulators is impossible unless the test program is repeated which makes this approach impractical alternative to such model tests direct numerical simulations of transient manoeuvres in irregular seaway is not mature enough presently for routine use in design and regulatory approval see shigunov et al 2018 a practical assessment approach in shigunov 2017 referred to as the comprehensive assessment is based on separate evaluation of different contributions forces due to waves wind propeller rudder etc from simple model tests numerical calculations or empirical formulae and a combination of these contributions in a simple mathematical model the details of this procedure and a discussion of the assumptions used can be found in shigunov 2017 here details related to its practical use are discussed the solution method is based on neglecting oscillatory forces and moments due to waves since the time scale of such oscillations is shorter than the time scale of manoeuvres and thus considering only average in time forces moments and other variables propeller thrust torque and rotation speed required and available power drift angle and rudder angle note that oscillatory motions in waves may influence time average characteristics e g oscillatory pitch and heave can lead to propeller ventilation and thus influence time average characteristics of the engine and propeller which is however not relevant in the environmental conditions concerned here see shigunov 2017 for a detailed discussion neglecting oscillatory forces and moments due to waves reduces the evaluation of manoeuvrability criteria to a solution of coupled motion equations in the horizontal plane under the action of time average wave induced index d forces and moments wind forces and moments w calm water reactions s rudder forces r and propeller thrust t projecting forces on the x and y axes and moments on the z axis of the ship fixed coordinate system fig 2 leads to a system of motion equations which converges to a steady state described by the following system note that a converged solution can be achieved in various ways including time domain simulations 1 x s x w x d x r t 1 t 0 2 y s y w y d y r 0 3 n s n w n d y r l r 0 the coordinate system has an origin o in the main section at the water plane x y and z axes point towards bow starboard and downward respectively positive rotations and moments with respect to z axis are clockwise when seen from above the ship speed is v s its heading deviates from the course by the drift angle β positive clockwise when seen from above the main wave and wind directions are described by angles β e and β w respectively rudder angle δ is positive to port the lever l r in the yaw moment due to rudder y r l r in eq 3 in general differs from l pp 2 because of pressure redistribution on the ship stern due to rudder influence note that eq 1 uses longitudinal projections i e projections on the x axis of the ship bound coordinate system of the forces on the ship hull since they are required to define the thrust these projections are frequently called resistance or added resistance erroneously or for brevity although resistance is the time average force in the opposite direction to the time average ship speed which is equal in the absolute value to the longitudinal force only in cases with zero mean lateral drift a converged solution described by the system 1 3 contains the required propeller thrust t drift angle of the ship β and the rudder angle δ from the required propeller thrust the propeller advance ratio j and the rotation speed n p of the propeller are found using thrust identity see section 5 6 the assessment is based on the comparison of the required delivered power p d with the available delivered power p d av both of which are defined at the actual rotation speed of the propeller using open water propeller characteristics for the former see section 5 6 and engine characteristics for the latter see fig 4 and the corresponding description in the text it is convenient to plot the converged solutions in polar coordinates ship speed radial coordinate mean seaway direction circumferential coordinate for a given sea state i e significant wave height h s and mean zero upcrossing wave period t z see examples in fig 3 line a along which p d p d av 1 shows the maximum attainable speed for the given propulsion system and given sea state vs the mean seaway direction it has a smaller radius in bow seaways than in following and stern quartering seaways because added resistance in bow seaways is significantly greater than in following and stern quartering and reduces in radius with increasing seaway severity and for a given sea state with reduced installed power the line of the maximum available steering effort c limits the area within which the required steering effort exceeds the available one e g along this line the required rudder angle achieves possible maximum this line shows the minimum speed at which steering is possible for a given steering system and given sea state vs mean seaway direction it is usually located between following and beam seaway directions and increases in radius with increasing wave height or reducing wave period and for a given sea state with reducing rudder area or increasing lateral windage area for illustration lines a and c are shown for examples discussed below solid lines and for 1 m lower and 1 m greater significant wave height dashed and dash dot lines respectively arrows indicate increasing wave height for each group of three lines finally along line b the ship speed is equal to the required advance speed in the propulsion criterion here 6 0 knots to satisfy the propulsion ability criterion the maximum of the ratio p d p d av along the line b v s 6 knots should not exceed 1 0 in other words lines a and b should not cross to satisfy the steering ability criterion the maximum of the ratio p d p d av along the line c i e line of maximum available steering effort should not exceed 1 0 i e line a should not cross line c thus the area between lines a and c corresponds to combinations of ship speed and wave directions for which steering is possible whereas crossing of these lines means that steering is impossible for some wave directions the left plot shows an example of a seaway in which the vessel fulfils both criteria line a does not cross lines b and c in the middle plot the installed power is marginally sufficient to fulfil the propulsion ability criterion it provides the maximum advance speed of 6 0 knots in head seaway where solid line a touches line b in the right plot the installed power is marginally sufficient to fulfil the steering ability criterion in nearly beam seaway solid line a touches solid line c one of critical aspects for the assessment of manoeuvrability in adverse conditions is modelling of the main engine and propulsion system under high load frequently constant rotation speed constant torque or other assumptions are used which lead to wrong results here to evaluate the manoeuvrability criteria the required delivered power p d is compared with the available delivered power p d av at the actual propulsion point in adverse conditions the former is defined by the assessment procedure from resistance and propulsion characteristics whereas the latter depends on the characteristics of the main engine and should be provided as a function of the rotation speed by the engine manufacturer note that the available brake power vs rotation speed is provided by the engine manufacturer for the actual as built engine for eedi verification thus the proposed assessment does not require any new measurements in the examples in this paper data from man 2014 were used when manufacturer data were not available the available delivered power on the propeller was calculated as p d av η s η g p b av p pto p d is the delivered power to the propeller p b is the brake power of the engine η s is the shaft efficiency η g is the gear efficiency and p pto is the power take off for illustration the engine diagram of a two stroke low speed turbocharged marine diesel engine is shown in fig 4 the horizontal axis corresponds to the rotation speed as percentage of rotation speed at the maximum continuous rating mcr and the vertical axis shows shaft power as percentage of mcr note logarithmic scales used for both axes line 1 corresponds to the maximum rotation speed shown at 105 of the nominal rotation speed man 2014 the minimum rotation speed limit or idle limit corresponding to 25 30 of the nominal rotation speed is not shown curve 2 light propeller curve corresponds to resistance and propulsion characteristics of clean hull and propeller in calm water shaft power along this line is defined by hull resistance open water propeller characteristics and hull propeller interaction coefficients curve 3 heavy propeller curve is assumed in design as a propeller curve for fouled hull and propeller in heavy weather it is obtained by shifting the light propeller curve to the left by the so called light propeller margin lpm and upwards by a sea margin sm up to point m point m corresponds to mcr and is the layout point for the engine the maximum continuous output of a diesel engine is bounded by the power limit line 4 at maximum rotation speeds maximum power continuously provided by the engine is constant and equal to mcr the maximum torque limit line 5 defining the shafting system bearing strength and corresponding to the full mean effective pressure mep in cylinders at moderately reduced rotation speeds torque is constant and thus the maximum engine output is proportional to rotation speed n p and the surge limit line 6 relevant at low rotation speeds and imposed by the availability of air from the turbocharger line 8 is the engine overload limit typically about 10 of mcr at point m whereas the area between lines 2 4 5 and 6 is available for continuous operation in adverse conditions or during manoeuvres without time limitation the area between lines 4 5 6 and 8 is available for overload running for limited time periods 1 h per 12 h according to man 2014 this area should not be used for manoeuvring in adverse conditions increased resistance in adverse conditions or during manoeuvres shifts line 2 upwards e g up to line 9 thus the maximum engine output is defined by the intersection point a of line 9 with one of the engine limit curves 4 5 or 6 the above concerns low speed two stroke diesel engines working directly on a fixed pitch propeller for vessels equipped with a controllable pitch propeller it was assumed that the propeller operates at a constant nominal rotation speed and the pitch of propeller blades is adjusted to the required forward speed and thrust more application examples and validation of the comprehensive assessment in comparison with model tests can be found in shigunov 2018 the aim of this paper is to develop a simpler assessment procedure and validate it in comparison with the comprehensive assessment 3 simplified assessment 3 1 simplified propulsion ability assessment the idea of the simplified assessment is to provide a simple procedure for routine use by reducing the number of assessment cases the number of terms in motion equations and the amount of the required input while keeping all relevant physics and addressing the same criteria as those evaluated by the comprehensive assessment for the propulsion ability criterion the starting point is the system of equations 1 3 which is solved for all relevant forward speeds and all possible seaway directions noting that bow seaways are most critical for the required power at a given speed fig 3 middle plot it is enough to consider only seaways from 0 to about 60 off bow further in the situations corresponding to the maximum required power at 6 knots advance speed the drift angle achieves up to about 15 in the cases considered so far which may lead to a change in the longitudinal calm water force up to about 25 both increase and decrease however the corresponding change in the required installed power due to lateral drift is up to about 3 5 which is small compared to other contributions therefore lateral drift is neglected which significantly simplifies the problem equations 2 and 3 can be omitted thus only eq 1 needs to be considered and only in bow seaways 4 x s x w x d x r t 1 t h 0 here the sum of the time average longitudinal force due to waves x d wind force x w and rudder force x r is taken as the maximum force over mean wave directions from 0 to 60 off bow figs 5 and 6 compare the results of the proposed simplified propulsion ability assessment with the results of the comprehensive assessment of propulsion ability for 4 bulk carriers 3 tankers and 4 container ships at h s from 0 0 to 9 5 m the results indicate that the simplified assessment procedure is sufficiently accurate becoming slightly conservative when p d p d av 1 however such cases are not relevant anyway 3 2 simplified steering ability assessment for the simplified steering ability assessment the starting point is system 1 3 solved for all relevant forward speeds and all seaway directions to check that the ship is able to start or continue course change in seaway from any direction for the steering ability assessment both steering and propulsion systems are involved as integral parts e g ships with powerful propulsion may have a smaller rudder and ships with weaker propulsion may compensate this with larger or more effective steering devices in the comprehensive assessment of steering ability which takes into account both the available steering effort and the available power it is convenient to find the conditions ship speed and wave direction which maximize the ratio p d p d av along the line c of the maximum available steering effort called for brevity critical conditions for steering to satisfy the steering ability criterion the maximum of the ratio p d p d av along line c should not exceed 1 in other words line a should not touch line c the area between lines a and c corresponds to combinations of ship speed and wave directions for which steering is possible whereas crossing of these lines means that steering is impossible in some wave directions compare what happens with the satisfaction of the propulsion ability and steering ability criteria when the installed power is systematically reduced whereas other parameters are kept the same line a will reduce in radius and the minimum required installed power to satisfy the propulsion ability criterion will correspond to the situation when line a touches line b whereas the minimum required installed power to satisfy the steering ability criterion will correspond to the situation when line a touches line c similarly wave height can be systematically increased while keeping the other parameters the same in this case the result will be the marginal wave heights for the propulsion ability and steering ability requirements for a given installed power since the ship has to satisfy both the propulsion ability and steering ability requirements such situations when due to reducing line a in radius it first touches line b in bow seaways while not touching yet line c like in fig 3 middle are not relevant in this section since the minimum required power for such cases will be defined by the propulsion ability criterion the simplified assessment procedure for which was developed in the previous section and therefore it does not matter what happens if the installed power is further reduced for the development of the simplified steering ability assessment only such cases are relevant when line a touches line c while not crossing yet line b like in fig 3 right experience of sea farers as well as results of the comprehensive assessment for many ships in many environmental conditions in this work indicates that the stern quartering seaways are always most critical for the steering ability requirement with the increasing wave height the area limited by line c where the required steering effort exceeds the available one always occurs first at low forward speeds in stern quartering seaways see fig 3 left and middle frequently already in moderate environmental conditions in wave directions from about 40 to about 60 degree off stern line c has the biggest radius which means that fulfilment of the steering ability criterion in these wave directions requires the highest speed but not the highest required power since added resistance in these wave directions is relatively low however as long as the area limited by line c is localised in stern quartering waves like in fig 3 left and middle reduction of line a in radius due to reducing installed power or increasing wave height will lead to its touching first line b whereas some area between lines a and c will still be available for steering this means that in such cases satisfaction of the propulsion ability criterion will require a larger installed power than satisfaction of the steering ability criterion therefore the steering ability criterion will not be relevant for design assessment although it will be relevant for operation which is not addressed here physically this means that steering in stern quartering waves in such cases is possible by increasing forward speed and such increase will require less power than advance at 6 knots speed in bow seaways since added power in stern quartering seaways is significantly less than in bow seaways if however the area limited by line c is so big as in fig 3 right which corresponds to steep waves small rudder or big lateral windage area so that reducing line a in radius first leads to its touching line c while not crossing yet line b then the installed power will not be sufficient to keep a necessary forward speed for steering in stern quartering seaways while still being sufficient to advance at 6 knots speed in bow seaways in such cases the steering ability requirement will be relevant for the definition of the required installed power or for the definition of marginal wave height for a given power rather than the propulsion ability requirement therefore such cases are addressed here in the development of the simplified steering ability assessment as show results of comprehensive assessment for many ships in many sea states in all such cases touching of lines a and c happens in seaway directions close to beam which is understandable since line c is located between following and beam seaways line a has smaller radius in beam than in stern quartering seaways and line c should have a big enough radius so that line a does not cross line b in bow seaway first since line a has the smallest radius in bow seaways in other words critical conditions for steering are more demanding with respect to the required installed power than the propulsion ability criterion only in such cases when they occur in seaway directions close to beam consequently taking as an approximation the time average wave and wind induced forces in the steering ability assessment in the beam seaway direction instead of the exact critical conditions for steering makes a moderate error in these forces in the majority of cases less than 20 in 95 of cases which is acceptable for a simplified assessment therefore the first simplification in the simplified assessment of steering ability is that the time average wave and wind induced forces and moments are evaluated in beam seaway to validate this simplification steering ability was assessed using the following system of equations written here for the converged state 5 x s x w 90 x d 90 x r t 1 t 0 6 y s y w 90 y d 90 y r 0 7 n s n w 90 n d 90 y r l r 0 where the upper index 90 means that forces are taken in beam seaway fig 7 compares steering ability assessment results using this simplified system 5 7 with the results of comprehensive steering ability assessment using system 1 3 for a container ship and a tanker and shows that this simplification is sufficiently accurate the second simplification stems from the comparison of the levers of the time average wave and wind induced yaw moments with the lever of the calm water yaw moment in critical conditions for steering introduce the levers of the calm water yaw moment and time average wind and wave induced yaw moments as l s n s y s l w n w y w and l d n d y d respectively and rewrite eq 7 as 8 l s y s l w y w 90 l d y d 90 y r l r 0 expressing y s from eq 6 as y s y w 90 y d 90 y r and introducing it into eq 8 leads to 9 y w 90 l w l s y d 90 l d l s y r l s l r comparing terms of converged solutions of system 5 7 shows that l s l pp 2 l w l s and l d l s in critical conditions for steering fig 8 thus eq 9 can be simplified y w 90 0 l s y d 90 0 l s y r l s l r or 10 y r b y w 90 y d 90 where 11 b l s l s l r as a result the system of equations 5 7 reduces to only one equation 5 and check 10 the solution of eq 5 provides the maximum attainable speed corresponding propeller rotation speed and thrust and thus defines the maximum available lateral force on the rudder y r av to satisfy the steering ability requirement this force should be not less than the required lateral steering force defined by eq 10 assuming l r 0 5 l pp simplifies eq 11 to 12 b l s l s 0 5 l pp which can also be written as 13 b y s l s y s l s y s 0 5 l pp n s n s 0 5 y s l pp n s n s 0 5 y s y s y s 0 5 ρ l pp t m v s 2 n s n s 0 5 ρ l pp 2 t m v s 2 are the coefficients of the calm water side force and yaw moment respectively note that they depend only on drift angle β fig 9 compares results of the steering ability assessment according to approximation 5 10 with the results of comprehensive assessment 1 3 for 15 sample bulk carriers tankers and container ships in the simplified assessment the value of b was taken from comprehensive assessment results in critical conditions for steering as b n s n s 0 5 y s l pp the comparison shows that the approximation 5 10 provides accurate results becoming more conservative when p d p d av 1 i e cases which are not relevant for the considered problem anyway in the long term an empirical formula should be established for b as a function of main ship particulars a conservative assumption following from the application of the comprehensive assessment to many ships is b 0 5 fig 10 compares results of the simplified steering ability assessment 5 10 using b 0 5 with comprehensive assessment results for bulk carriers tankers and container ships and shows that the resulting approximation provides accurate to slightly conservative results 4 level 1 assessment the idea of the level 1 assessment the simplest assessment level is to apply pure empirical formulae to directly define high level output e g the required installed power or required thrust as a function of main ship parameters below are some examples minimum power lines mpl imo 2013 2014 2015 define the minimum required installed power in terms of the maximum continuous rating mcr kw as a function of deadweight dwt t as 14 mcr a dwt b constants a and b are defined as 0 0763 and 3374 3 respectively for bulk carriers with deadweight below 145000 t 0 0490 and 7329 0 respectively for bulk carriers with deadweight of 145000 t and more and 0 0652 and 5960 2 respectively for tankers and combination carriers the application of eq 14 with these coefficients was extended to phase 2 of eedi implementation up to december 31 2024 i e it is presently applicable to bulk carriers with dwt of 10000 t and more and tankers and combination carriers with dwt of 4000 t and more empirical formulae proposed by shopera see imo 2016a based on results of comprehensive assessment for more than 400 bulk carriers tankers container ships and general cargo vessels with length between perpendiculars from about 120 m to 320 m equipped with two stroke low speed diesel engines fixed pitch propellers and conventional rudders at the standard wave heights from imo 2013 are formulated separately for the propulsion ability and steering ability requirements as 15 mcr 0 21 c b 0 5 l pp 2 16 mcr 0 15 c r l pp 2 respectively mcr is the required installed power in kw c r l pp t m 50 a r a r min 2 a r 3 a r p where a r is the total rudder area and a r p is the rudder area in propeller race fig 11 compares these formulae with comprehensive assessment results indicating that these formulae are conservative but produce significant scatter work imo 2016b proposed to develop empirical formulation for the required propeller thrust at bollard pull using results of model tests and numerical simulations of manoeuvres in seaway for sufficiently many ships in imo 2016b turning into seaway heading recovery was used as a manoeuvrability criterion which is similar to the weather vaning criterion proposed by shopera and therefore does not consider propulsion ability and steering ability criteria applied here apart from this i e assuming that the empirical formulation is based on the fulfilment of appropriate manoeuvrability criteria thrust at bollard pull may be a more suitable variable for level 1 formulation than the installed power generally assessment procedures based on empirical formulae may be very useful in practice to easily identify conventional ships with big safety margins which do not require a more accurate analysis however such procedures cannot replace performance based assessment for ships near the acceptance boundaries or for unconventional vessels besides such procedures are applicable only to ships with parameters within the applicability range of the empirical formulae 5 evaluation methods 5 1 general comprehensive and simplified assessment procedures require definition of multiple input elements time average wave induced forces and moments wind forces calm water reactions rudder forces and propeller characteristics the proposed assessment procedures allow defining any of these elements separately and if necessary with different methods experimental numerical or empirical depending on the needs and possibilities of the designer for particular ship designs an important question however is what accuracy is required when designers define each force component to quantify the relative importance of the components of forces and moments the comprehensive assessment was conducted for several ships of different types and sizes using as input the original components of forces and moments and for comparison cases where each of these components was changed in turn by 10 the required installed power to satisfy separately propulsion ability and steering ability requirements in the environmental conditions according to imo 2013 was defined for the original and comparative cases and the change in the required installed power due to the 10 change in the components of forces and moments was calculated table 1 shows the results as the percentage of the change in the required installed power maximum values over all considered ships the figures mean that for example a change in the calm water x force by 10 changes the installed power required to fulfil the propulsion criterion by 1 5 according to these results most important for the propulsion and steering abilities in adverse conditions are shown in bold in table 1 the time average wave induced x and y forces calm water x and y forces and z moment and the lateral rudder force an error of about 15 in these components leads to the error in the required installed power of 5 in the simplified assessment all methods applied to define input components for the comprehensive assessment can be used as well note however that the number of the required components and the number of the situations in which they are required is significantly reduced e g propulsion assessment requires only longitudinal forces and only in bow wave directions besides it seems especially useful to develop additional simple empirical formulae see below specifically for the simplified assessment to enable its application in the preliminary design or to simplify assessment in cases with big safety margins below a short overview of evaluation methods is given see imo 2016a and shigunov 2017 for more details note that the aim of this paper is not to select and recommend specific methods that are suitable for regulatory approval the advantage of the proposed assessment procedures is that any validated method can be used to define the input elements thus the designers are in a better position to decide what method is most suitable for the ships that they are designing therefore one of the aims of this section is to check whether evaluation methods are available in principle for all required input elements only in this case the proposed assessment procedures make practical sense and besides provide additional very simple evaluation methods to further simplify the simplified assessment procedure 5 2 calm water hydrodynamic reactions the calm water hydrodynamic forces and moment can be calculated as 17 x s 0 5 x s β ρ v s 2 l pp t m 18 y s 0 5 y s β ρ v s 2 l pp t m 19 n s 0 5 n s β ρ v s 2 l pp 2 t m the prime indicates non dimensional coefficients for the comprehensive assessment these coefficients can be defined with well established and widely available experimental methods or from numerical simulations based on solution of reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations empirical methods are in principle also available and can be used within their applicability limits in the sample assessments presented in this paper rans based simulations were used validated for several ships by comparison with model tests the simplified assessment for both propulsion ability eq 4 and steering ability eq 5 requires only longitudinal force which can be defined by methods approved for eedi verification note that this verification must be performed anyway this solution was proposed in imo 2017a 5 3 wind forces and moment the forces and moment due to wind are expressed as 20 x w 0 5 x w ε ρ a v w 2 a f 21 y w 0 5 y w ε ρ a v w 2 a l 22 n w 0 5 n w ε ρ a v w 2 a l l oa the prime indicates non dimensional coefficients ρ a is the air density a f and a l are respectively the frontal and lateral projected areas above the water plane and l oa is the overall ship length the relative wind speed v w and the apparent wind angle of attack ε measured from the ship centre plane positive for wind coming from port fig 2 were calculated as v w a 2 b 2 0 5 and ε cos 1 a v w sign b respectively a u w cos β w β v s cosβ b u w sin β w β v s sinβ and u w is the absolute wind speed the coefficients x w y w and n w can be defined from well established model tests in widely available testing facilities or from existing empirical data e g blendermann 2014 and fujiwara et al 2006 numerical methods based on rans or des detached eddy simulations in full scale are available and increasingly used in the sample assessments presented in this paper experimental measurements for few ships rans based simulations and empirical data from blendermann 2014 were used the mentioned evaluation methods can be used both in the comprehensive and simplified assessment procedures due to availability of comprehensive empirical data for wind forces e g blendermann 2014 and fujiwara et al 2006 additional simple empirical formulae specifically for the simplified assessment seem rather unnecessary still such formulae may be useful and are therefore proposed in the simplified propulsion assessment maximum of x w in head and bow quartering wind is required from available data in shopera and jasnaoe coordinated projects a default value of 1 1 was proposed in imo 2017a which is increased to 1 4 for ships with big windage areas of deck cranes to account for shadowing effects in head wind the simplified steering ability assessment requires the longitudinal and lateral wind induced forces in beam wind the longitudinal force due to beam wind strongly depends on the geometry of the windage area of the ship a consistent approximation for this force would be x w 90 0 5 x w 0 cos ε ρ a v w 2 a f i e x w 90 0 5 x w 0 ρ a v s u w a f x w 0 is the coefficient of longitudinal wind force in head wind conservatively 1 1 which was found to lead to consistently conservative results compared to the longitudinal force in critical conditions for steering based on measurements fig 12 empirically it was found that an assumption x w 90 0 5 x w 0 ρ a v s 2 a f provides a sufficiently close approximation fig 12 not always conservative but note that this force does not require a high accuracy since an error of 60 in this force leads to about 5 error in the required installed power table 1 the lateral force due to beam wind can be approximated as y w 90 0 5 y w 90 ρ a a l u w 2 where y w 90 is the coefficient of the lateral force due to beam wind conservatively 1 0 fig 13 compares this formula with measurements 5 4 time average wave induced forces according to existing regulations and proposals imo 2012a 2013 2016a 2017a time average wave

and directions model tests can be used however such tests require advanced measurements in a seakeeping basin which cannot be used routinely availability of numerical and especially empirical methods for the time average wave induced forces is one of the most critical issues for practical design and approval and their development and validation was one of the major tasks in shopera the results of the international benchmarking conducted by shopera shigunov et al 2018 show significant progress in the development of numerical and empirical methods in the last years and their availability in principle for practical and regulatory purposes however the results also show that their application should be verified in each individual case for the sample assessments presented in this paper the wave induced forces and moments were defined using numerical computations with the software gl rankine see söding and shigunov 2015 validated in comparison with experimental measurements available for some ships the simplified propulsion ability assessment requires maximum time average wave induced surge force in head to bow quartering wave directions in short crested waves it is sufficient to use head waves since head waves produce maximum surge force even when the quadratic transfer function is maximal in oblique waves fig 14 whereas if long crested head waves are used the added resistance should be multiplied by an empirical correction factor 1 3 see imo 2017a in shopera empirical formulae were developed specifically for the simplified propulsion assessment the approach developed in liu et al 2015 and liu and papanikolaou 2016 provides simple empirical expressions for the transfer functions of added resistance in bow waves a simpler approach directly providing the maximum time average surge force in irregular short crested bow waves x d 83 l pp c b 1 5 1 fr 0 5 h s 2 see imo 2016a is based on computations with method gl rankine söding and shigunov 2015 followed by spectral integration in irregular short crested waves described by jonswap wave energy spectrum with γ 3 3 and cos2 wave energy spreading and taking the maximum over mean wave headings from head waves up to 60 off bow and peak wave periods from 7 to 15 s after work imo 2016a extensive computations of added resistance in irregular short crested bow waves were carried out to develop an improved formula specifically for bulk carriers and tankers for the revised guidelines imo 2017a the result 24 x d 1336 5 3 v s b wl t l pp 0 75 h s 2 where v s is the ship speed in m s b wl is the waterline breadth and t is the draught midships is based on numerical computations for 50 bulk carriers tankers and general cargo vessels with l pp in the range from 90 to 320 m c b from 0 78 to 0 87 l pp b wl ratio from 5 0 to 7 9 and b wl t ratio from 2 0 to 3 3 at the forward speeds from 0 to 8 knots fig 15 compares these empirical formulae with numerical computations for bulk carriers tankers general cargo container roro and cruise vessels the empirical formula for transfer functions of added resistance in head waves from liu et al 2015 and liu and papanikolaou 2016 and the simple formula 24 for the added resistance in irregular short crested head waves are included as default methods in the joint proposal imo 2017a the simplified steering ability assessment requires time average wave induced surge and sway forces in irregular short crested beam waves for both simple empirical formulae were developed in shopera see imo 2016a using numerical computations with gl rankine followed by spectral integration for jonswap spectrum with γ 3 3 and cos2 wave energy spreading as a maximum over peak wave periods from 7 to 15 s for the time average surge force in irregular short crested beam waves a simple formula x d 90 380 l pp c b 1 5 0 1 fr h s 2 was developed in imo 2016a where fr v s g l pp 0 5 here it is improved as 25 x d 90 83 l pp c b 0 5 h s 2 v s 1 v s 3 fig 16 compares these two formulae with numerical computations whereas the spreading of results of the empirical formulae for x d 90 is significantly greater than for the added resistance in head waves the sensitivity of the final result required installed power to the accuracy of the definition of x d 90 is much less thus the achieved accuracy seems acceptable for the time average wave induced sway force in irregular short crested beam waves y d 90 the formula was developed by the author for imo 2016a fig 17 compares it with numerical computations note that this formula was developed to define the maximum force over the peak wave periods used in the assessment procedure thus it can be applied only near the smallest and therefore maximizing the sway force peak wave period used in the assessment t p 3 6 h s 0

propeller to define rudder forces experimental methods are widely available including well established methods not requiring expensive facilities and thus suitable for design and approval numerical methods rans simulations are also in principle available imo 2016a especially important for practical use is the availability of simple empirical methods shigunov 2017 validates two such methods brix 1993 and söding 1998 vs experiments for a small tanker and vs rans simulations for a 14000 teu container ship a thorough validation of available empirical methods in shopera see imo 2016a including their benchmarking together with the jasnaoe coordinated project concluded that such methods are in principle available for practical use figs 18 and 19 show additional validation examples of semi empirical methods from brix 1993 söding 1998 and yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 note that all of these methods are based on momentum theory resulting from this joint work the lateral rudder force y r for a 14000 teu container ship in bollard pull in comparison with model experiments and rans simulations fig 18 and the longitudinal x r and lateral y r rudder forces for a handysize bulk carrier in comparison with model experiments fig 19 note that rudder forces are defined in the ship coordinate system fig 2 note that in the propulsion ability and steering ability assessment examples in this paper method from brix 1993 was used in fig 18 the lowest propeller rotation speed top plot corresponds to propeller loading relevant for steering ability assessment both methods from brix 1993 and yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 provide decent lateral force although they do not reproduce the asymmetry of the lateral force with respect to the rudder angle the same relates to the other propeller rotation speeds since they do not model rotational effects in the propeller race the middle and bottom plots in fig 18 correspond to higher loading of the propeller than relevant for the steering ability assessment the model from brix 1993 predicts the lateral force very well the model from yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 provides slightly non conservative results i e it over estimates the lateral rudder force rans results are slightly conservative in fig 19 the top plots the lowest propeller rotation speed correspond to too low loading of the propeller than loading relevant for the steering ability assessment both models from brix 1993 and yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 provide close slightly conservative i e they over estimate the resistance longitudinal force on the rudder compared to the measurements models from brix 1993 and söding 1998 show close and conservative i e under estimating the measurements results for the lateral force and model from yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 shows non conservative results note however big scatter of experimental results for this case the middle plots in fig 19 correspond to propeller loading relevant for the steering ability assessment models from brix 1993 and yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 show close results for the longitudinal force slightly conservative over estimating experiments at medium rudder angles the lateral rudder force is predicted very well by models from brix 1993 and söding 1998 while over predicted i e non conservatively predicted by the model from yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 in the bottom plots in fig 19 the propeller loading is too high to be relevant for the steering ability assessment here the method from yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 provides close slightly conservative predictions of the longitudinal rudder force compared to experiments whereas the method from brix 1993 provides much too conservative results the lateral rudder force significantly differs between the methods from brix 1993 and söding 1998 both of which significantly over estimate the experiments the method from yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 provides the best results for the lateral rudder force between the three methods although still non conservative these results show that the methods from brix 1993 and yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 are suitable as simple empirical methods for rudder forces in propeller race for propeller loadings relevant for the steering ability assessment moreover since both these methods are semi empirical their parameters hull rudder and propeller rudder interaction coefficients can be fine tuned for particular designs for practical use in regulatory approval the simplified steering ability assessment requires definition of the maximum available lateral steering force y r av which depends on the maximum attainable forward speed and the corresponding propeller thrust defined by eq 5 thus this assessment needs rather accurate models for rudder forces on the other hand the simplified propulsion assessment requires only the added resistance on the rudder due to manoeuvring in bow quartering seaway proposal imo 2017a suggests 3 of propeller thrust as a default conservative estimate fig 20 showing additional resistance on the hull and rudder due to propeller overload at various drift and rudder angles confirms the additional longitudinal force on the rudder due to propeller overload of about 3 of propeller thrust at 20 rudder angle 5 6 propulsion characteristics propeller thrust is found from equation 1 and 4 or 5 using a known thrust deduction fraction t from the found thrust the advance ratio j is defined from the relation t ρ u a 2 d p 2 k t j j 2 u a u s 1 w is the propeller advance speed and d p is the propeller diameter using a known open water propeller curve k t j and a given wake fraction w from the so found advance ratio j k q is found from the open water propeller curve k q j the propeller rotation speed is found as n p u a j d p and the required delivered power is defined as p d 2 π q n p 2 π ρ n p 3 d p 5 k q j where q is the propeller torque therefore the required power in seaway depends not only on the resistance increase but also on the change in the open water propeller characteristics and hull propeller interaction coefficients in waves about which it is very little known presently the required delivered power 27 p d p e η d x t v s η d where p e x t v s is the effective power p d 2 π q n p is the delivered power to the propeller x t is the total resistance and 28 η d η h η 0 η r is the propulsive efficiency with the hull efficiency η h 1 t 1 w on the thrust deduction fraction t and wake fraction w the relative rotative efficiency η r q 0 q defined as the ratio of the propeller torque in open water q 0 to propeller torque behind ship q and the open water propeller efficiency 29 η 0 t u a 2 π q 0 n p k t j 2 π k q eq 28 shows that η d changes in waves due to first change in η 0 due to change in the propulsion point i e advance ratio due to added resistance and due to change in propeller characteristics k t j and k q j near the free surface and second change in hull propeller interaction coefficients η r and η h in seaway the open water propeller characteristics change in waves see e g faltinsen et al 1980 and nakatake 1976 due to wave generation by the propeller when the submergence of the propeller shaft centre is less than about 1 5 of the propeller radius further emersion of the propeller leads to its emergence and ventilation when the submergence of the propeller shaft is close to the propeller radius as well as splashing of propeller blades into water see wagner 1925 these effects occur however in heavier sea at lower draught or at higher forward speeds than those relevant here the relative rotative efficiency η r can both increase and decrease in waves results of tests in moor and murdey 1970 and nakamura and naito 1977 do not allow drawing conclusions about the influence of waves on η r measurements in regular waves of various lengths and heights up to 3 6 m height for a ship with l pp of 221 m in valanto and hong 2017 show that η r remains almost constant equal to its calm water value regarding the change in η h in waves moor and murdey 1970 and nakamura and naito 1977 report decrease in thrust deduction with increasing wave height and increasing pitch motions several studies e g faltinsen et al 1980 suggested that propeller overload in calm water produces a similar decrease in t if the thrust loading coefficient c t h corresponds to that in waves which makes the definition of t in waves very simple on the other hand faltinsen et al 1980 moor and murdey 1970 and nakamura and naito 1977 also report increase in wake velocities due to wave induced ship motions thus both nominator and denominator in η h increase in waves and the total change of η h in waves is uncertain in valanto and hong 2017 change of η 0 and η d is measured in regular waves of various heights and lengths the largest change occurring at the wave length of about 1 09 of ship length wave height to wave length ratio about 1 5 corresponds to a decrease in η 0 of about 8 and decrease in η d of about 9 i e the decrease in η h η r is only about 1 which is less than accuracy of measurements thus loss of propulsive efficiency η d can be explained entirely by the loss of the open water propeller efficiency η 0 due to the change in operation point whereas η h and η r are almost constant and equal to their calm water values note however that the tests in valanto and hong 2017 were done at higher forward speed and in lower waves than those relevant here and that the wind resistance was not considered consideration of these factors should increase propeller loading and thus further reduce the thrust deduction fraction t whereas it is easy to conduct additional towing tests or numerical simulations with overloaded propeller in calm water to define the thrust deduction in seaway fig 20 such tests cannot define the change in wake fraction due to waves and ship motions and thus may lead to a non conservative estimate of η h in ittc 2018 which concerns however more moderate sea states than those relevant here thrust identity method is used and the open water propeller characteristics wake fraction and thrust deduction are taken from calm water tests in ittc 2002 concerning more severe sea states which are relevant also here three procedures are analysed one from which the direct power method is recommended in this method transfer functions of power in regular waves are measured directly at the model self propulsion point thus the propeller characteristics and hull propeller interaction coefficients in waves are implicitly considered although for a slightly more loaded propeller namely at the model self propulsion point however calm water power is corrected for scale effects similarly in the second torque and rate of rotation method transfer functions of the change in torque and propeller rotation speed are defined from model tests in regular waves at model self propulsion point in the third thrust method transfer functions of thrust increase are defined from model tests in regular waves at the model self propulsion point thus this method requires propeller characteristics to define added power in waves which are taken as the open water propeller characteristics in calm water note that none of these three methods is suitable for the problem considered here since added resistance due to wind and rudder operation cannot be taken into account the thrust identity method is also mentioned in ittc 2002 as one of methods under discussion in this method added resistance due to waves is calculated from the transfer functions measured in regular waves thus wind resistance and other resistance components can be simply added however definition of the required power in this method requires propeller characteristics and hull propeller interaction coefficients which are defined in calm water note that accurate definition of propeller characteristics and hull propeller interaction coefficients in seaway for design and regulatory approval concerning manoeuvrability in adverse conditions is presently not critical since with the presently available knowledge ship designers will not try to optimise these characteristics to fulfil the minimum power regulations therefore some simplifications are possible until more knowledge is available therefore in the joint proposal imo 2017a thrust identity method is used to define the added power in adverse conditions and the open water propeller characteristics and hull propeller interaction coefficients are recommended to be defined by the methods approved for eedi verification i e presently from calm water propulsion and resistance tests so that no additional work is needed since eedi verification is required anyway in imo 2013 also empirical formulae are proposed for the thrust deduction fraction and wake fraction based on calm water values in the examples of assessments presented in this paper calm water values were used 6 discussion the proposed flexible approach to the assessment of ship s manoeuvrability under adverse conditions allows choosing between various procedures ranging from advanced assessment which is required for cases with large uncertainties to simple procedures sufficient for most conventional vessels three levels of complexity are considered the most accurate level 3 comprehensive assessment allows the best accuracy even in this procedure the designer does not have to use expensive evaluation methods to define the input elements and can choose between experimental numerical or empirical methods a less complex level 2 simplified assessment still considers the physics of the problem but applies a reduced number of assessment situations reduced complexity equations and significantly less input elements than the comprehensive assessment the simplest assessment level 1 relies on empirical formulae to define the required installed power as a function of main ship parameters level 1 assessment as a pure empirical procedure is applicable only to the vessels similar to those for which it was developed still it shows significant scatter even for such vessels note however that alternative ideas e g using bollard pull instead of installed power as in imo 2016b may lead to better results the simplified assessment is a compromise between simplicity flexibility and accuracy the analysis is simple and may use simple methods to define input elements while remaining open for high accuracy input elements if necessary however due to the simplifications involved this procedure is conservative the comprehensive assessment allows the best accuracy but requires extensive input three components surge and sway forces and yaw moment of calm water forces for drift angles from zero up to about 20 wind forces for 0 180 apparent wind directions and wave induced forces for 0 180 wave directions at all relevant wave frequencies as well as rudder forces and propeller characteristics the proposed comprehensive and simplified assessment procedures allow defining any of the input elements separately and with different methods experimental numerical or empirical depending on the needs and possibilities of designers and administrations experimental methods are established and available in sufficiently many facilities world wide for the evaluation of calm water wind rudder and propeller forces whereas measurement of the time average wave induced forces and moments needs advanced measurements in a seakeeping basin and therefore cannot be used routinely numerical methods are available in principle for calm water wind rudder and propeller forces again their availability for the time average wave induced forces is one of the most critical issues see shigunov et al 2018 the availability of empirical methods is especially important for practical design and approval the studies by shopera and the jasnaoe coordinated project concluded that such methods are in principle available for practical use for calm water reactions wind forces and rudder forces empirical methods for the time average wave induced forces and moments again require attention thus the availability of numerical and empirical methods for wave induced forces is critical for the practical implementation of the proposed assessment framework an important question is the overall uncertainty of the resulting procedures and practical ways to deal with this uncertainty level 1 shows high uncertainty which can be compensated only by its additional conservativeness for both the comprehensive and simplified assessment procedures the greatest uncertainty stems from the difference between the real operation strongly depending on human decisions such as ordering a tug waiting at anchor leaving dangerous area or searching for a shelter and design assessment criteria propulsion steering and weather vaning criteria considered here the second greatest source of uncertainty is introduced by the step from the assessment criteria to the practical assessment procedure i e here the omission of the time dependent wave induced forces and reducing the assessment to time average characteristics which simplifies not only the hydrodynamic forces but also transient reactions of the engine and propeller in waves this simplification although widely used has not been validated conclusively so far note validation of the comprehensive assessment in comparison with model tests and for an accident example in shigunov 2018 one more error is introduced in the simplified assessment due to the reduced number of assessment cases and simplified equations compared to the comprehensive assessment since the development of the simplified assessment was the aim of this paper it was validated here in comparison with the comprehensive assessment figs 5 6 9 and 10 show that this error is rather moderate and conservative the final source of uncertainties are the methods that are used to define the input elements for the comprehensive and simplified assessment procedures since the accuracy of the input can and must be verified in the regulatory approval this uncertainty is controllable this concerns also the dedicated simple empirical formulae that were developed here specifically for the simplified assessment the included validation examples show that their accuracy is sufficient the uncertainty introduced by the time averaging assumption can be quantified by comparison of the results of comprehensive assessment with transient model tests or numerical simulations note however that this is difficult to do in irregular short crested waves combined with wind and taking into account the need for accurate statistical estimates on the other hand verification of the gap between the real operation and practical criteria is not possible in a strict sense nevertheless a pragmatic solution to address this gap which also addresses the uncertainty due to time averaging is possible as long as the criteria and assessment procedures concern relevant ship characteristics for manoeuvrability in adverse conditions i e parameters of the steering and propulsion systems and treat them in a correct way these uncertainties can be compensated by fine tuning the standards here the wave height and wind force up to which the ship should satisfy the proposed criteria to be considered as safe this fine tuning can be done by applying the assessment procedures to a sufficiently big number of existing vessels taking into account accident statistics and individual accidents see imo 2016a and shigunov 2018 the standards should be adjusted in such a way that the resulting assessment appropriately differentiates safe and unsafe ships 7 conclusions the introduction of eedi raised the need to norm standardise ship s manoeuvrability under adverse conditions which requires definition of assessment criteria and corresponding measures and standards the research projects conducted by iacs eu shopera and jasnaoe proposed steering ability and propulsion ability criteria as minimum requirements for manoeuvrability of ships in adverse conditions related to the installed power this paper addresses evaluation of these criteria in practical design and regulatory approval keeping in mind that the problem of manoeuvrability in adverse weather conditions is very difficult and presently dealt with only in few advanced research centres worldwide a flexible assessment framework is proposed which includes three alternative levels of complexity the most accurate comprehensive assessment level 3 allows the best accuracy but requires a big number of input elements a less complex simplified assessment level 2 involves a reduced number of assessment situations reduced complexity equations and significantly less input elements the simplest assessment level 1 relies on empirical formulae to define the required installed power directly as a function of main ship parameters another factor contributing to the flexibility of the proposed assessment framework is that any input element required in the comprehensive and simplified assessment procedures can be defined separately and with different methods either experimental numerical or empirical depending on the needs and possibilities of designers and administrations experimental numerical and empirical methods are in principle established and available for all input elements apart from the time average wave induced forces and moments their experimental definition requires expensive measurements in a seakeeping basin whereas numerical and empirical methods for them are only developing especially useful for practical design and approval is the availability of simple empirical formulae dedicated specifically for the simplified assessment several such formulae are developed and validated in this paper for wave and wind induced forces and rudder forces the uncertainty of the resulting procedures and practical ways to deal with this uncertainty are discussed the uncertainty of the empirical level 1 assessment can be compensated only by its excessive conservativeness for the comprehensive and simplified assessment procedures the uncertainty stems from simplifications in criteria assumptions used in the assessment procedure use of time average characteristics and in the simplified assessment also reduced number of assessment cases and simplified equations and the uncertainties of methods used to define input elements the latter uncertainty is controllable the uncertainty introduced by the simplified assessment is evaluated in this paper and the remaining uncertainties i e uncertainties due to simplifications in criteria and assessment procedure can be pragmatically addressed by fine tuning the standards the wave height and wind force up to which the ship should satisfy the proposed criteria to be considered safe in such a way that the resulting assessment appropriately differentiates safe and unsafe

21949,the introduction of eedi raised the need for norming standardising of ship s manoeuvrability under adverse conditions besides the necessary criteria measures and standards developed in several research projects and described elsewhere also procedures and methods for the practical evaluation of the proposed criteria in design and regulatory approval are required which are addressed in this paper the idea is to develop a flexible assessment framework ranging from advanced assessment procedures necessary in cases with large uncertainties and near the acceptance boundary to simple procedures which are sufficient for the majority of conventional vessels the paper outlines the background of three levels of assessment procedures and describes in detail possible approaches towards level 2 and level 1 assessment procedures for propulsion and steering criteria the proposed assessment procedures require definition of multiple input components time average wave induced forces and moments wind forces calm water reactions rudder induced forces and propeller characteristics the paper discusses the availability of different methods experimental numerical or empirical for these components and besides proposes and validates several simple empirical formulae developed specifically for the simplified assessment to further reduce its complexity keywords manoeuvrability in adverse conditions criteria standards regulations 1 introduction the following terminology is used in the paper the term criterion refers to a characteristic of the ship such as ability to turn keep course etc by which ship s abilities relevant for the considered problem are judged a corresponding measure e g turning diameter or overshoot angle quantifies the ship s performance with respect to the considered criterion for manoeuvrability in adverse conditions a convenient and popular measure is the marginal maximum severity of seaway i e maximum wave height and corresponding wind speed up to which the ship can fulfil the criterion the term standard sometimes called norm refers to the acceptance limit of this measure to qualify the ship as fulfilling the corresponding criterion here the standard is the specified significant wave height and the related wind force manoeuvrability of ships is presently specified by the rules of classification societies ship owner requirements and non mandatory but gaining increasing acceptance by administrations and classification societies imo standards for ship manoeuvrability imo 2002 the latter address turning initial turning yaw checking course keeping and emergence stopping abilities which are evaluated in simple standard manoeuvres in calm water these standards have been criticized for not addressing ship manoeuvring characteristics at limited speed in restricted areas and in adverse weather conditions see e g quadvlieg and van coevorden 2008 the importance of the latter aspect increased after the introduction of the energy efficiency design index eedi which raised concerns see e g imo 2010 that some ship designers will achieve eedi requirements by simple reducing the installed power which may lead to insufficient manoeuvrability in heavy weather see discussion in shigunov 2018 to solve this problem rational criteria measures and standards are required which concern propulsion and steering abilities of ships in adverse conditions these issues are summarised below and addressed in detail elsewhere see imo 2012a b shigunov and papanikolaou 2015 and shigunov 2017 2018 the aim of this paper is to discuss assessment procedures that can be used for the evaluation of the proposed criteria in practical design and approval work by iacs on minimum power requirements for manoeuvrability in adverse weather conditions led to the development of two criteria a course keeping criterion which requires that the ship should be able to keep course in waves and wind from any direction and a propulsion criterion which requires that the ship should be able to keep advance speed of at least 4 0 knots in waves and wind from any direction imo 2012a c for practical evaluation of these criteria iacs proposed three assessment levels the most accurate comprehensive assessment level 3 allows the best accuracy by solving three nonlinear motion equations to evaluate separately propulsion and steering criteria the simplified assessment level 2 still considers the physics of the problem but uses a reduced number of assessment scenarios and reduced complexity of equations the idea of the simplified steering ability assessment in imo 2012a c was to replace the steering ability assessment in seaway from any direction by propulsion assessment in head seaway at a specifically defined forward speed which replaces model tests or numerical simulations in waves and wind from all directions with simpler tests or simulations in head waves only to achieve this simplification the required ship speed in the propulsion assessment v ck was defined in such a way that the fulfilment of propulsion requirement in head seaway at this speed automatically fulfils the course keeping requirement in any seaway direction the definition of v ck as a function of the rudder area and ship windage areas was derived empirically using results of comprehensive assessment for several ships a comparison of the marginal significant wave heights obtained directly from the evaluation of the steering ability criterion with the marginal significant wave heights obtained from the evaluation of the propulsion ability criterion at the maximum of two forward speeds v s max 4 knots v ck in fig 1 shows a good correlation but also that the formula for v ck is in general not conservative level 1 the simplest assessment procedure in imo 2012a c is an empirical formula defining the required installed power as a function of deadweight minimum power line mpl the follow up discussion at imo led to a revision of level 1 removal of comprehensive assessment due to the absence of methods for the components required in this assessment and relaxing of standards wave heights in the simplified assessment and resulted in the 2013 interim guidelines for determining minimum propulsion power to maintain the manoeuvrability of ship in adverse conditions imo 2013 updated in imo 2014 2015 thus the presently acting guidelines include level 1 assessment mpl and simplified propulsion assessment which implements both the propulsion ability and steering ability criteria the latter indirectly through v ck speed the project shopera conducted a review of existing regulations interviews of ship masters and detailed accident investigations in shigunov 2017 as well as accident statistics in ventikos et al 2015 to identify relevant scenarios criteria and corresponding standards this led to the identification of three scenarios open sea coastal areas and restricted areas at limited speed each of which requires specific criteria shigunov and papanikolaou 2015 for the open sea scenario the weather vaning ability criterion was proposed the ship should be able to keep heading in head to bow quartering seaway up to 60 off bow a similar heading recovery criterion was proposed in imo 2016b where it means the ability of the ship to turn from beam into head seaway the formulation in imo 2016b is much more difficult to evaluate in practice since it requires model tests or numerical simulations of transient manoeuvres in irregular waves and wind note also that weather vaning in bow seaways is rather a propulsion than steering problem inability to complete a turn in bow seaway is always related to insufficient propulsion ability unlike steering in beam or stern quartering seaways imo 2016b confirms this since the results weakly depend on manoeuvring characteristics of the hull and rudder for manoeuvring in coastal waters the following two criteria were proposed in shigunov and papanikolaou 2015 steering ability ship s ability to perform any manoeuvre in seaway from any direction and propulsion ability ship s ability to maintain a specified speed in seaway from any direction the required speed in the propulsion criterion was increased compared to imo 2013 2014 2015 from 4 knots to 6 knots to consider possible strong currents in coastal areas because the ability to perform any manoeuvre is impossible to evaluate in practice an equivalent but easier to evaluate steering ability criterion was formulated as the ship should be able to overcome environmental forces to start or continue course change in seaway from any direction the third scenario manoeuvring at limited speed in restricted areas concerning situations where the forward speed and thus the applied engine power must be reduced significantly below attainable due to navigational restrictions e g during approaching to or entering ports navigation in channels and rivers etc led in shigunov and papanikolaou 2015 to the following criteria course keeping at a specified low speed in strong wind in shallow water in shallow water near a bank and in shallow water during overtaking by a quicker ship in shigunov 2016 2018 it was shown that ships satisfying the propulsion and steering criteria in coastal waters satisfy the weather vaning requirements in the open sea with a sufficiently high probability thus the assessment for the open sea scenario is unnecessary note also that in the third scenario the full available power cannot be applied therefore this scenario is not affected by the eedi requirements and is not considered here therefore shopera proposed in imo 2016a the steering ability and propulsion ability criteria for coastal waters as a basis for the minimum requirements for manoeuvrability in adverse conditions related to the installed power see shigunov 2018 for a detailed discussion of scenarios criteria and corresponding environmental conditions in this paper the aspects of the practical evaluation of the proposed criteria are addressed for the practical evaluation of the proposed criteria shopera proposed level 1 2 and 3 assessment procedures each separately for the propulsion ability and steering ability criteria besides the project spent significant efforts to develop methods for the definition of the components required for the comprehensive and simplified assessments see imo 2016a for overview and below for more details in the proposal for revised guidelines concerning bulk carriers and tankers imo 2017a b jointly prepared by shopera and the jasnaoe coordinated research project in japan mpl from imo 2013 2014 2015 are adopted as level 1 the propulsion ability criterion is evaluated using the simplified assessment procedure and the steering ability criterion is dropped thus the proposal in imo 2017a contains simplified assessment level 2 for the propulsion criterion and mpl level 1 2 comprehensive assessment compliance with the standards imo 2002 is demonstrated in full scale trials which is impossible for the assessment of manoeuvrability in adverse weather conditions direct evaluation of the proposed criteria in transient model experiments with self propelled ship models in simulated irregular waves and wind for all required combinations of wave directions and periods is unfeasible for several reasons first interpretation of transient manoeuvres in seaway as safe or unsafe is not always possible especially in marginal cases i e cases near the failure boundary which are of interest in approval second results of such tests strongly depend on the time history of steering which causes too large variability and uncertainty of test results i e such tests cannot be reliably verified third reliable statistical predictions in irregular seaway require repetition of tests in multiple long realisations of each seaway which is too expensive fourth very few facilities exist worldwide able to perform such tests which makes such tests impractical for routine design and approval finally verification of such tests by regulators is impossible unless the test program is repeated which makes this approach impractical alternative to such model tests direct numerical simulations of transient manoeuvres in irregular seaway is not mature enough presently for routine use in design and regulatory approval see shigunov et al 2018 a practical assessment approach in shigunov 2017 referred to as the comprehensive assessment is based on separate evaluation of different contributions forces due to waves wind propeller rudder etc from simple model tests numerical calculations or empirical formulae and a combination of these contributions in a simple mathematical model the details of this procedure and a discussion of the assumptions used can be found in shigunov 2017 here details related to its practical use are discussed the solution method is based on neglecting oscillatory forces and moments due to waves since the time scale of such oscillations is shorter than the time scale of manoeuvres and thus considering only average in time forces moments and other variables propeller thrust torque and rotation speed required and available power drift angle and rudder angle note that oscillatory motions in waves may influence time average characteristics e g oscillatory pitch and heave can lead to propeller ventilation and thus influence time average characteristics of the engine and propeller which is however not relevant in the environmental conditions concerned here see shigunov 2017 for a detailed discussion neglecting oscillatory forces and moments due to waves reduces the evaluation of manoeuvrability criteria to a solution of coupled motion equations in the horizontal plane under the action of time average wave induced index d forces and moments wind forces and moments w calm water reactions s rudder forces r and propeller thrust t projecting forces on the x and y axes and moments on the z axis of the ship fixed coordinate system fig 2 leads to a system of motion equations which converges to a steady state described by the following system note that a converged solution can be achieved in various ways including time domain simulations 1 x s x w x d x r t 1 t 0 2 y s y w y d y r 0 3 n s n w n d y r l r 0 the coordinate system has an origin o in the main section at the water plane x y and z axes point towards bow starboard and downward respectively positive rotations and moments with respect to z axis are clockwise when seen from above the ship speed is v s its heading deviates from the course by the drift angle β positive clockwise when seen from above the main wave and wind directions are described by angles β e and β w respectively rudder angle δ is positive to port the lever l r in the yaw moment due to rudder y r l r in eq 3 in general differs from l pp 2 because of pressure redistribution on the ship stern due to rudder influence note that eq 1 uses longitudinal projections i e projections on the x axis of the ship bound coordinate system of the forces on the ship hull since they are required to define the thrust these projections are frequently called resistance or added resistance erroneously or for brevity although resistance is the time average force in the opposite direction to the time average ship speed which is equal in the absolute value to the longitudinal force only in cases with zero mean lateral drift a converged solution described by the system 1 3 contains the required propeller thrust t drift angle of the ship β and the rudder angle δ from the required propeller thrust the propeller advance ratio j and the rotation speed n p of the propeller are found using thrust identity see section 5 6 the assessment is based on the comparison of the required delivered power p d with the available delivered power p d av both of which are defined at the actual rotation speed of the propeller using open water propeller characteristics for the former see section 5 6 and engine characteristics for the latter see fig 4 and the corresponding description in the text it is convenient to plot the converged solutions in polar coordinates ship speed radial coordinate mean seaway direction circumferential coordinate for a given sea state i e significant wave height h s and mean zero upcrossing wave period t z see examples in fig 3 line a along which p d p d av 1 shows the maximum attainable speed for the given propulsion system and given sea state vs the mean seaway direction it has a smaller radius in bow seaways than in following and stern quartering seaways because added resistance in bow seaways is significantly greater than in following and stern quartering and reduces in radius with increasing seaway severity and for a given sea state with reduced installed power the line of the maximum available steering effort c limits the area within which the required steering effort exceeds the available one e g along this line the required rudder angle achieves possible maximum this line shows the minimum speed at which steering is possible for a given steering system and given sea state vs mean seaway direction it is usually located between following and beam seaway directions and increases in radius with increasing wave height or reducing wave period and for a given sea state with reducing rudder area or increasing lateral windage area for illustration lines a and c are shown for examples discussed below solid lines and for 1 m lower and 1 m greater significant wave height dashed and dash dot lines respectively arrows indicate increasing wave height for each group of three lines finally along line b the ship speed is equal to the required advance speed in the propulsion criterion here 6 0 knots to satisfy the propulsion ability criterion the maximum of the ratio p d p d av along the line b v s 6 knots should not exceed 1 0 in other words lines a and b should not cross to satisfy the steering ability criterion the maximum of the ratio p d p d av along the line c i e line of maximum available steering effort should not exceed 1 0 i e line a should not cross line c thus the area between lines a and c corresponds to combinations of ship speed and wave directions for which steering is possible whereas crossing of these lines means that steering is impossible for some wave directions the left plot shows an example of a seaway in which the vessel fulfils both criteria line a does not cross lines b and c in the middle plot the installed power is marginally sufficient to fulfil the propulsion ability criterion it provides the maximum advance speed of 6 0 knots in head seaway where solid line a touches line b in the right plot the installed power is marginally sufficient to fulfil the steering ability criterion in nearly beam seaway solid line a touches solid line c one of critical aspects for the assessment of manoeuvrability in adverse conditions is modelling of the main engine and propulsion system under high load frequently constant rotation speed constant torque or other assumptions are used which lead to wrong results here to evaluate the manoeuvrability criteria the required delivered power p d is compared with the available delivered power p d av at the actual propulsion point in adverse conditions the former is defined by the assessment procedure from resistance and propulsion characteristics whereas the latter depends on the characteristics of the main engine and should be provided as a function of the rotation speed by the engine manufacturer note that the available brake power vs rotation speed is provided by the engine manufacturer for the actual as built engine for eedi verification thus the proposed assessment does not require any new measurements in the examples in this paper data from man 2014 were used when manufacturer data were not available the available delivered power on the propeller was calculated as p d av η s η g p b av p pto p d is the delivered power to the propeller p b is the brake power of the engine η s is the shaft efficiency η g is the gear efficiency and p pto is the power take off for illustration the engine diagram of a two stroke low speed turbocharged marine diesel engine is shown in fig 4 the horizontal axis corresponds to the rotation speed as percentage of rotation speed at the maximum continuous rating mcr and the vertical axis shows shaft power as percentage of mcr note logarithmic scales used for both axes line 1 corresponds to the maximum rotation speed shown at 105 of the nominal rotation speed man 2014 the minimum rotation speed limit or idle limit corresponding to 25 30 of the nominal rotation speed is not shown curve 2 light propeller curve corresponds to resistance and propulsion characteristics of clean hull and propeller in calm water shaft power along this line is defined by hull resistance open water propeller characteristics and hull propeller interaction coefficients curve 3 heavy propeller curve is assumed in design as a propeller curve for fouled hull and propeller in heavy weather it is obtained by shifting the light propeller curve to the left by the so called light propeller margin lpm and upwards by a sea margin sm up to point m point m corresponds to mcr and is the layout point for the engine the maximum continuous output of a diesel engine is bounded by the power limit line 4 at maximum rotation speeds maximum power continuously provided by the engine is constant and equal to mcr the maximum torque limit line 5 defining the shafting system bearing strength and corresponding to the full mean effective pressure mep in cylinders at moderately reduced rotation speeds torque is constant and thus the maximum engine output is proportional to rotation speed n p and the surge limit line 6 relevant at low rotation speeds and imposed by the availability of air from the turbocharger line 8 is the engine overload limit typically about 10 of mcr at point m whereas the area between lines 2 4 5 and 6 is available for continuous operation in adverse conditions or during manoeuvres without time limitation the area between lines 4 5 6 and 8 is available for overload running for limited time periods 1 h per 12 h according to man 2014 this area should not be used for manoeuvring in adverse conditions increased resistance in adverse conditions or during manoeuvres shifts line 2 upwards e g up to line 9 thus the maximum engine output is defined by the intersection point a of line 9 with one of the engine limit curves 4 5 or 6 the above concerns low speed two stroke diesel engines working directly on a fixed pitch propeller for vessels equipped with a controllable pitch propeller it was assumed that the propeller operates at a constant nominal rotation speed and the pitch of propeller blades is adjusted to the required forward speed and thrust more application examples and validation of the comprehensive assessment in comparison with model tests can be found in shigunov 2018 the aim of this paper is to develop a simpler assessment procedure and validate it in comparison with the comprehensive assessment 3 simplified assessment 3 1 simplified propulsion ability assessment the idea of the simplified assessment is to provide a simple procedure for routine use by reducing the number of assessment cases the number of terms in motion equations and the amount of the required input while keeping all relevant physics and addressing the same criteria as those evaluated by the comprehensive assessment for the propulsion ability criterion the starting point is the system of equations 1 3 which is solved for all relevant forward speeds and all possible seaway directions noting that bow seaways are most critical for the required power at a given speed fig 3 middle plot it is enough to consider only seaways from 0 to about 60 off bow further in the situations corresponding to the maximum required power at 6 knots advance speed the drift angle achieves up to about 15 in the cases considered so far which may lead to a change in the longitudinal calm water force up to about 25 both increase and decrease however the corresponding change in the required installed power due to lateral drift is up to about 3 5 which is small compared to other contributions therefore lateral drift is neglected which significantly simplifies the problem equations 2 and 3 can be omitted thus only eq 1 needs to be considered and only in bow seaways 4 x s x w x d x r t 1 t h 0 here the sum of the time average longitudinal force due to waves x d wind force x w and rudder force x r is taken as the maximum force over mean wave directions from 0 to 60 off bow figs 5 and 6 compare the results of the proposed simplified propulsion ability assessment with the results of the comprehensive assessment of propulsion ability for 4 bulk carriers 3 tankers and 4 container ships at h s from 0 0 to 9 5 m the results indicate that the simplified assessment procedure is sufficiently accurate becoming slightly conservative when p d p d av 1 however such cases are not relevant anyway 3 2 simplified steering ability assessment for the simplified steering ability assessment the starting point is system 1 3 solved for all relevant forward speeds and all seaway directions to check that the ship is able to start or continue course change in seaway from any direction for the steering ability assessment both steering and propulsion systems are involved as integral parts e g ships with powerful propulsion may have a smaller rudder and ships with weaker propulsion may compensate this with larger or more effective steering devices in the comprehensive assessment of steering ability which takes into account both the available steering effort and the available power it is convenient to find the conditions ship speed and wave direction which maximize the ratio p d p d av along the line c of the maximum available steering effort called for brevity critical conditions for steering to satisfy the steering ability criterion the maximum of the ratio p d p d av along line c should not exceed 1 in other words line a should not touch line c the area between lines a and c corresponds to combinations of ship speed and wave directions for which steering is possible whereas crossing of these lines means that steering is impossible in some wave directions compare what happens with the satisfaction of the propulsion ability and steering ability criteria when the installed power is systematically reduced whereas other parameters are kept the same line a will reduce in radius and the minimum required installed power to satisfy the propulsion ability criterion will correspond to the situation when line a touches line b whereas the minimum required installed power to satisfy the steering ability criterion will correspond to the situation when line a touches line c similarly wave height can be systematically increased while keeping the other parameters the same in this case the result will be the marginal wave heights for the propulsion ability and steering ability requirements for a given installed power since the ship has to satisfy both the propulsion ability and steering ability requirements such situations when due to reducing line a in radius it first touches line b in bow seaways while not touching yet line c like in fig 3 middle are not relevant in this section since the minimum required power for such cases will be defined by the propulsion ability criterion the simplified assessment procedure for which was developed in the previous section and therefore it does not matter what happens if the installed power is further reduced for the development of the simplified steering ability assessment only such cases are relevant when line a touches line c while not crossing yet line b like in fig 3 right experience of sea farers as well as results of the comprehensive assessment for many ships in many environmental conditions in this work indicates that the stern quartering seaways are always most critical for the steering ability requirement with the increasing wave height the area limited by line c where the required steering effort exceeds the available one always occurs first at low forward speeds in stern quartering seaways see fig 3 left and middle frequently already in moderate environmental conditions in wave directions from about 40 to about 60 degree off stern line c has the biggest radius which means that fulfilment of the steering ability criterion in these wave directions requires the highest speed but not the highest required power since added resistance in these wave directions is relatively low however as long as the area limited by line c is localised in stern quartering waves like in fig 3 left and middle reduction of line a in radius due to reducing installed power or increasing wave height will lead to its touching first line b whereas some area between lines a and c will still be available for steering this means that in such cases satisfaction of the propulsion ability criterion will require a larger installed power than satisfaction of the steering ability criterion therefore the steering ability criterion will not be relevant for design assessment although it will be relevant for operation which is not addressed here physically this means that steering in stern quartering waves in such cases is possible by increasing forward speed and such increase will require less power than advance at 6 knots speed in bow seaways since added power in stern quartering seaways is significantly less than in bow seaways if however the area limited by line c is so big as in fig 3 right which corresponds to steep waves small rudder or big lateral windage area so that reducing line a in radius first leads to its touching line c while not crossing yet line b then the installed power will not be sufficient to keep a necessary forward speed for steering in stern quartering seaways while still being sufficient to advance at 6 knots speed in bow seaways in such cases the steering ability requirement will be relevant for the definition of the required installed power or for the definition of marginal wave height for a given power rather than the propulsion ability requirement therefore such cases are addressed here in the development of the simplified steering ability assessment as show results of comprehensive assessment for many ships in many sea states in all such cases touching of lines a and c happens in seaway directions close to beam which is understandable since line c is located between following and beam seaways line a has smaller radius in beam than in stern quartering seaways and line c should have a big enough radius so that line a does not cross line b in bow seaway first since line a has the smallest radius in bow seaways in other words critical conditions for steering are more demanding with respect to the required installed power than the propulsion ability criterion only in such cases when they occur in seaway directions close to beam consequently taking as an approximation the time average wave and wind induced forces in the steering ability assessment in the beam seaway direction instead of the exact critical conditions for steering makes a moderate error in these forces in the majority of cases less than 20 in 95 of cases which is acceptable for a simplified assessment therefore the first simplification in the simplified assessment of steering ability is that the time average wave and wind induced forces and moments are evaluated in beam seaway to validate this simplification steering ability was assessed using the following system of equations written here for the converged state 5 x s x w 90 x d 90 x r t 1 t 0 6 y s y w 90 y d 90 y r 0 7 n s n w 90 n d 90 y r l r 0 where the upper index 90 means that forces are taken in beam seaway fig 7 compares steering ability assessment results using this simplified system 5 7 with the results of comprehensive steering ability assessment using system 1 3 for a container ship and a tanker and shows that this simplification is sufficiently accurate the second simplification stems from the comparison of the levers of the time average wave and wind induced yaw moments with the lever of the calm water yaw moment in critical conditions for steering introduce the levers of the calm water yaw moment and time average wind and wave induced yaw moments as l s n s y s l w n w y w and l d n d y d respectively and rewrite eq 7 as 8 l s y s l w y w 90 l d y d 90 y r l r 0 expressing y s from eq 6 as y s y w 90 y d 90 y r and introducing it into eq 8 leads to 9 y w 90 l w l s y d 90 l d l s y r l s l r comparing terms of converged solutions of system 5 7 shows that l s l pp 2 l w l s and l d l s in critical conditions for steering fig 8 thus eq 9 can be simplified y w 90 0 l s y d 90 0 l s y r l s l r or 10 y r b y w 90 y d 90 where 11 b l s l s l r as a result the system of equations 5 7 reduces to only one equation 5 and check 10 the solution of eq 5 provides the maximum attainable speed corresponding propeller rotation speed and thrust and thus defines the maximum available lateral force on the rudder y r av to satisfy the steering ability requirement this force should be not less than the required lateral steering force defined by eq 10 assuming l r 0 5 l pp simplifies eq 11 to 12 b l s l s 0 5 l pp which can also be written as 13 b y s l s y s l s y s 0 5 l pp n s n s 0 5 y s l pp n s n s 0 5 y s y s y s 0 5 ρ l pp t m v s 2 n s n s 0 5 ρ l pp 2 t m v s 2 are the coefficients of the calm water side force and yaw moment respectively note that they depend only on drift angle β fig 9 compares results of the steering ability assessment according to approximation 5 10 with the results of comprehensive assessment 1 3 for 15 sample bulk carriers tankers and container ships in the simplified assessment the value of b was taken from comprehensive assessment results in critical conditions for steering as b n s n s 0 5 y s l pp the comparison shows that the approximation 5 10 provides accurate results becoming more conservative when p d p d av 1 i e cases which are not relevant for the considered problem anyway in the long term an empirical formula should be established for b as a function of main ship particulars a conservative assumption following from the application of the comprehensive assessment to many ships is b 0 5 fig 10 compares results of the simplified steering ability assessment 5 10 using b 0 5 with comprehensive assessment results for bulk carriers tankers and container ships and shows that the resulting approximation provides accurate to slightly conservative results 4 level 1 assessment the idea of the level 1 assessment the simplest assessment level is to apply pure empirical formulae to directly define high level output e g the required installed power or required thrust as a function of main ship parameters below are some examples minimum power lines mpl imo 2013 2014 2015 define the minimum required installed power in terms of the maximum continuous rating mcr kw as a function of deadweight dwt t as 14 mcr a dwt b constants a and b are defined as 0 0763 and 3374 3 respectively for bulk carriers with deadweight below 145000 t 0 0490 and 7329 0 respectively for bulk carriers with deadweight of 145000 t and more and 0 0652 and 5960 2 respectively for tankers and combination carriers the application of eq 14 with these coefficients was extended to phase 2 of eedi implementation up to december 31 2024 i e it is presently applicable to bulk carriers with dwt of 10000 t and more and tankers and combination carriers with dwt of 4000 t and more empirical formulae proposed by shopera see imo 2016a based on results of comprehensive assessment for more than 400 bulk carriers tankers container ships and general cargo vessels with length between perpendiculars from about 120 m to 320 m equipped with two stroke low speed diesel engines fixed pitch propellers and conventional rudders at the standard wave heights from imo 2013 are formulated separately for the propulsion ability and steering ability requirements as 15 mcr 0 21 c b 0 5 l pp 2 16 mcr 0 15 c r l pp 2 respectively mcr is the required installed power in kw c r l pp t m 50 a r a r min 2 a r 3 a r p where a r is the total rudder area and a r p is the rudder area in propeller race fig 11 compares these formulae with comprehensive assessment results indicating that these formulae are conservative but produce significant scatter work imo 2016b proposed to develop empirical formulation for the required propeller thrust at bollard pull using results of model tests and numerical simulations of manoeuvres in seaway for sufficiently many ships in imo 2016b turning into seaway heading recovery was used as a manoeuvrability criterion which is similar to the weather vaning criterion proposed by shopera and therefore does not consider propulsion ability and steering ability criteria applied here apart from this i e assuming that the empirical formulation is based on the fulfilment of appropriate manoeuvrability criteria thrust at bollard pull may be a more suitable variable for level 1 formulation than the installed power generally assessment procedures based on empirical formulae may be very useful in practice to easily identify conventional ships with big safety margins which do not require a more accurate analysis however such procedures cannot replace performance based assessment for ships near the acceptance boundaries or for unconventional vessels besides such procedures are applicable only to ships with parameters within the applicability range of the empirical formulae 5 evaluation methods 5 1 general comprehensive and simplified assessment procedures require definition of multiple input elements time average wave induced forces and moments wind forces calm water reactions rudder forces and propeller characteristics the proposed assessment procedures allow defining any of these elements separately and if necessary with different methods experimental numerical or empirical depending on the needs and possibilities of the designer for particular ship designs an important question however is what accuracy is required when designers define each force component to quantify the relative importance of the components of forces and moments the comprehensive assessment was conducted for several ships of different types and sizes using as input the original components of forces and moments and for comparison cases where each of these components was changed in turn by 10 the required installed power to satisfy separately propulsion ability and steering ability requirements in the environmental conditions according to imo 2013 was defined for the original and comparative cases and the change in the required installed power due to the 10 change in the components of forces and moments was calculated table 1 shows the results as the percentage of the change in the required installed power maximum values over all considered ships the figures mean that for example a change in the calm water x force by 10 changes the installed power required to fulfil the propulsion criterion by 1 5 according to these results most important for the propulsion and steering abilities in adverse conditions are shown in bold in table 1 the time average wave induced x and y forces calm water x and y forces and z moment and the lateral rudder force an error of about 15 in these components leads to the error in the required installed power of 5 in the simplified assessment all methods applied to define input components for the comprehensive assessment can be used as well note however that the number of the required components and the number of the situations in which they are required is significantly reduced e g propulsion assessment requires only longitudinal forces and only in bow wave directions besides it seems especially useful to develop additional simple empirical formulae see below specifically for the simplified assessment to enable its application in the preliminary design or to simplify assessment in cases with big safety margins below a short overview of evaluation methods is given see imo 2016a and shigunov 2017 for more details note that the aim of this paper is not to select and recommend specific methods that are suitable for regulatory approval the advantage of the proposed assessment procedures is that any validated method can be used to define the input elements thus the designers are in a better position to decide what method is most suitable for the ships that they are designing therefore one of the aims of this section is to check whether evaluation methods are available in principle for all required input elements only in this case the proposed assessment procedures make practical sense and besides provide additional very simple evaluation methods to further simplify the simplified assessment procedure 5 2 calm water hydrodynamic reactions the calm water hydrodynamic forces and moment can be calculated as 17 x s 0 5 x s β ρ v s 2 l pp t m 18 y s 0 5 y s β ρ v s 2 l pp t m 19 n s 0 5 n s β ρ v s 2 l pp 2 t m the prime indicates non dimensional coefficients for the comprehensive assessment these coefficients can be defined with well established and widely available experimental methods or from numerical simulations based on solution of reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations empirical methods are in principle also available and can be used within their applicability limits in the sample assessments presented in this paper rans based simulations were used validated for several ships by comparison with model tests the simplified assessment for both propulsion ability eq 4 and steering ability eq 5 requires only longitudinal force which can be defined by methods approved for eedi verification note that this verification must be performed anyway this solution was proposed in imo 2017a 5 3 wind forces and moment the forces and moment due to wind are expressed as 20 x w 0 5 x w ε ρ a v w 2 a f 21 y w 0 5 y w ε ρ a v w 2 a l 22 n w 0 5 n w ε ρ a v w 2 a l l oa the prime indicates non dimensional coefficients ρ a is the air density a f and a l are respectively the frontal and lateral projected areas above the water plane and l oa is the overall ship length the relative wind speed v w and the apparent wind angle of attack ε measured from the ship centre plane positive for wind coming from port fig 2 were calculated as v w a 2 b 2 0 5 and ε cos 1 a v w sign b respectively a u w cos β w β v s cosβ b u w sin β w β v s sinβ and u w is the absolute wind speed the coefficients x w y w and n w can be defined from well established model tests in widely available testing facilities or from existing empirical data e g blendermann 2014 and fujiwara et al 2006 numerical methods based on rans or des detached eddy simulations in full scale are available and increasingly used in the sample assessments presented in this paper experimental measurements for few ships rans based simulations and empirical data from blendermann 2014 were used the mentioned evaluation methods can be used both in the comprehensive and simplified assessment procedures due to availability of comprehensive empirical data for wind forces e g blendermann 2014 and fujiwara et al 2006 additional simple empirical formulae specifically for the simplified assessment seem rather unnecessary still such formulae may be useful and are therefore proposed in the simplified propulsion assessment maximum of x w in head and bow quartering wind is required from available data in shopera and jasnaoe coordinated projects a default value of 1 1 was proposed in imo 2017a which is increased to 1 4 for ships with big windage areas of deck cranes to account for shadowing effects in head wind the simplified steering ability assessment requires the longitudinal and lateral wind induced forces in beam wind the longitudinal force due to beam wind strongly depends on the geometry of the windage area of the ship a consistent approximation for this force would be x w 90 0 5 x w 0 cos ε ρ a v w 2 a f i e x w 90 0 5 x w 0 ρ a v s u w a f x w 0 is the coefficient of longitudinal wind force in head wind conservatively 1 1 which was found to lead to consistently conservative results compared to the longitudinal force in critical conditions for steering based on measurements fig 12 empirically it was found that an assumption x w 90 0 5 x w 0 ρ a v s 2 a f provides a sufficiently close approximation fig 12 not always conservative but note that this force does not require a high accuracy since an error of 60 in this force leads to about 5 error in the required installed power table 1 the lateral force due to beam wind can be approximated as y w 90 0 5 y w 90 ρ a a l u w 2 where y w 90 is the coefficient of the lateral force due to beam wind

and directions model tests can be used however such tests require advanced measurements in a seakeeping basin which cannot be used routinely availability of numerical and especially empirical methods for the time average wave induced forces is one of the most critical issues for practical design and approval and their development and validation was one of the major tasks in shopera the results of the international benchmarking conducted by shopera shigunov et al 2018 show significant progress in the development of numerical and empirical methods in the last years and their availability in principle for practical and regulatory purposes however the results also show that their application should be verified in each individual case for the sample assessments presented in this paper the wave induced forces and moments were defined using numerical computations with the software gl rankine see söding and shigunov 2015 validated in comparison with experimental measurements available for some ships the simplified propulsion ability assessment requires maximum time average wave induced surge force in head to bow quartering wave directions in short crested waves it is sufficient to use head waves since head waves produce maximum surge force even when the quadratic transfer function is maximal in oblique waves fig 14 whereas if long crested head waves are used the added resistance should be multiplied by an empirical correction factor 1 3 see imo 2017a in shopera empirical formulae were developed specifically for the simplified propulsion assessment the approach developed in liu et al 2015 and liu and papanikolaou 2016 provides simple empirical expressions for the transfer functions of added resistance in bow waves a simpler approach directly providing the maximum time average surge force in irregular short crested bow waves x d 83 l pp c b 1 5 1 fr 0 5 h s 2 see imo 2016a is based on computations with method gl rankine söding and shigunov 2015 followed by spectral

off bow and peak wave periods from 7 to 15 s after work imo 2016a extensive computations of added resistance in irregular short crested bow waves were carried out to develop an improved formula specifically for bulk carriers and tankers for the revised guidelines imo 2017a the result 24 x d 1336 5 3 v s b wl t l pp 0 75 h s 2 where v s is the ship speed in m s b wl is the waterline breadth

from 5 0 to 7 9 and b wl t ratio from 2 0 to 3 3 at the forward speeds from 0 to 8 knots fig 15 compares these empirical formulae with numerical computations for bulk carriers tankers general cargo container roro and cruise vessels the empirical formula for transfer functions of added resistance in head waves from liu et al 2015 and liu and papanikolaou 2016 and the simple formula 24 for the added resistance in irregular short crested head waves are included as default methods in the joint proposal imo 2017a the simplified steering ability assessment requires time average wave induced surge and sway forces in irregular short crested beam waves for both simple empirical formulae were developed in shopera see imo 2016a using numerical computations with gl rankine followed by spectral integration for jonswap spectrum with γ 3 3 and cos2 wave energy spreading as a maximum over peak wave periods from 7 to 15 s for the time average surge force in irregular short crested beam waves a simple formula x d 90 380 l pp c b 1 5 0 1 fr h s 2 was developed in imo 2016a where fr v s g l pp 0 5 here it is improved as 25 x d 90 83 l pp c b 0 5 h s 2 v s 1 v s 3 fig 16 compares these two formulae with numerical computations whereas the spreading of results of the empirical formulae for x d 90 is significantly greater than for the added resistance in head waves the sensitivity of the final result required installed power to the accuracy of the definition of x d 90 is much less thus the achieved accuracy seems acceptable for the time average wave induced sway force in irregular short crested beam waves y d 90 the formula was developed by the author for imo 2016a fig 17 compares it with numerical computations note that this formula was developed to define the maximum force

propeller to define rudder forces experimental methods are widely available including well established methods not requiring expensive facilities and thus suitable for design and approval numerical methods rans simulations are also in principle available imo 2016a especially important for practical use is the availability of simple empirical methods shigunov 2017 validates two such methods brix 1993 and söding 1998 vs experiments for a small tanker and vs rans simulations for a 14000 teu container ship a thorough validation of available empirical methods in shopera see imo 2016a including their benchmarking together with the jasnaoe coordinated project concluded that such methods are in principle available for practical use figs 18 and 19 show additional validation examples of semi empirical methods from brix 1993 söding 1998 and yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 note that all of these methods are based on momentum theory resulting from this joint work the lateral rudder force y r for a 14000 teu container ship in bollard pull in comparison with model experiments and rans simulations fig 18 and the longitudinal x r and lateral y r rudder forces for a handysize bulk carrier in comparison with model experiments fig 19 note that rudder forces are defined in the ship coordinate system fig 2 note that in the propulsion ability and steering ability assessment examples in this paper method from brix 1993 was used in fig 18 the lowest propeller rotation speed top plot corresponds to propeller loading relevant for steering ability assessment both methods from brix 1993 and yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 provide decent lateral force although they do not reproduce the asymmetry of the lateral force with respect to the rudder angle the same relates to the other propeller rotation speeds since they do not model rotational effects in the propeller race the middle and bottom plots in fig 18 correspond to higher loading of the propeller than relevant for the steering ability assessment the model from brix 1993 predicts the lateral force very well the model from yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 provides slightly non conservative results i e it over estimates the lateral rudder force rans results are slightly conservative in fig 19 the top plots the lowest propeller rotation speed correspond to too low loading of the propeller than loading relevant for the steering ability assessment both models from brix 1993 and yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 provide close slightly conservative i e they over estimate the resistance longitudinal force on the rudder compared to the measurements models from brix 1993 and söding 1998 show close and conservative i e under estimating the measurements results for the lateral force and model from yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 shows non conservative results note however big scatter of experimental results for this case the middle plots in fig 19 correspond to propeller loading relevant for the steering ability assessment models from brix 1993 and yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 show close results for the longitudinal force slightly conservative over estimating experiments at medium rudder angles the lateral rudder force is predicted very well by models from brix 1993 and söding 1998 while over predicted i e non conservatively predicted by the model from yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 in the bottom plots in fig 19 the propeller loading is too high to be relevant for the steering ability assessment here the method from yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 provides close slightly conservative predictions of the longitudinal rudder force compared to experiments whereas the method from brix 1993 provides much too conservative results the lateral rudder force significantly differs between the methods from brix 1993 and söding 1998 both of which significantly over estimate the experiments the method from yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 provides the best results for the lateral rudder force between the three methods although still non conservative these results show that the methods from brix 1993 and yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 are suitable as simple empirical methods for rudder forces in propeller race for propeller loadings relevant for the steering ability assessment moreover since both these methods are semi empirical their parameters hull rudder and propeller rudder interaction coefficients can be fine tuned for particular designs for practical use in regulatory approval the simplified steering ability assessment requires definition of the maximum available lateral steering force y r av which depends on the maximum attainable forward speed and the corresponding propeller thrust defined by eq 5 thus this assessment needs rather accurate models for rudder forces on the other hand the simplified propulsion assessment requires only the added resistance on the rudder due to manoeuvring in bow quartering seaway proposal imo 2017a suggests 3 of propeller thrust as a default conservative estimate fig 20 showing additional resistance on the hull and rudder due to propeller overload at various drift and rudder angles confirms the additional longitudinal force on the rudder due to propeller overload of about 3 of propeller thrust at 20 rudder angle 5 6 propulsion characteristics propeller thrust is found from equation 1 and 4 or 5 using a known thrust deduction fraction t from the found thrust the advance ratio j is defined from the relation t ρ u a 2 d p 2 k t j j 2 u a u s 1 w is the propeller advance speed and d p is the propeller diameter using a known open water propeller curve k t j and a given wake fraction w from the so found advance ratio j k q is found from the open water propeller curve k q j the propeller rotation speed is found as n p u a j d p and the required delivered power is defined as p d 2 π q n p 2 π ρ n p 3 d p 5 k q j where q is the propeller torque therefore the required power in seaway depends not only on the resistance increase but also on the change in the open water propeller characteristics and hull propeller interaction coefficients in waves about which it is very little known presently the required delivered power 27 p d p e η d x t v s η d where p e x t v s is the effective power p d 2 π q n p is the delivered power to the propeller x t is the total resistance and 28 η d η h η 0 η r is the propulsive efficiency with the hull efficiency η h 1 t 1 w on the thrust deduction fraction t and wake fraction w the relative rotative efficiency η r q 0 q defined as the ratio of the propeller torque in open water q 0 to propeller torque behind ship q and the open water propeller efficiency 29 η 0 t u a 2 π q 0 n p k t j 2 π k q eq 28 shows that η d changes in waves due to first change in η 0 due to change in the propulsion point i e advance ratio due to added resistance and due to change in propeller characteristics k t j and k q j near the free surface and second change in hull propeller interaction coefficients η r and η h in seaway the open water propeller characteristics change in waves see e g faltinsen et al 1980 and nakatake 1976 due to wave generation by the propeller when the submergence of the propeller shaft centre is less than about 1 5 of the propeller radius further emersion of the propeller leads to its emergence and ventilation when the submergence of the propeller shaft is close to the propeller radius as well as splashing of propeller blades into water see wagner 1925 these effects occur however in heavier sea at lower draught or at higher forward speeds than those relevant here the relative rotative efficiency η r can both increase and decrease in waves results of tests in moor and murdey 1970 and nakamura and naito 1977 do not allow drawing conclusions about the influence of waves on η r measurements in regular waves of various lengths and heights up to 3 6 m height for a ship with l pp of 221 m in valanto and hong 2017 show that η r remains almost constant equal to its calm water value regarding the change in η h in waves moor and murdey 1970 and nakamura and naito 1977 report decrease in thrust deduction with increasing wave height and increasing pitch motions several studies e g faltinsen et al 1980 suggested that propeller overload in calm water produces a similar decrease in t if the thrust loading coefficient c t h corresponds to that in waves which makes the definition of t in waves very simple on the other hand faltinsen et al 1980 moor and murdey 1970 and nakamura and naito 1977 also report increase in wake velocities due to wave induced ship motions thus both nominator and denominator in η h increase in waves and the total change of η h in waves is uncertain in valanto and hong 2017 change of η 0 and η d is measured in regular waves of various heights and lengths the largest change occurring at the wave length of about 1 09 of ship length wave height to wave length ratio about 1 5 corresponds to a decrease in η 0 of about 8 and decrease in η d of about 9 i e the decrease in η h η r is only about 1 which is less than accuracy of measurements thus loss of propulsive efficiency η d can be explained entirely by the loss of the open water propeller efficiency η 0 due to the change in operation point whereas η h and η r are almost constant and equal to their calm water values note however that the tests in valanto and hong 2017 were done at higher forward speed and in lower waves than those relevant here and that the wind resistance was not considered consideration of these factors should increase propeller loading and thus further reduce the thrust deduction fraction t whereas it is easy to conduct additional towing tests or numerical simulations with overloaded propeller in calm water to define the thrust deduction in seaway fig 20 such tests cannot define the change in wake fraction due to waves and ship motions and thus may lead to a non conservative estimate of η h in ittc 2018 which concerns however more moderate sea states than those relevant here thrust identity method is used and the open water propeller characteristics wake fraction and thrust deduction are taken from calm water tests in ittc 2002 concerning more severe sea states which are relevant also here three procedures are analysed one from which the direct power method is recommended in this method transfer functions of power in regular waves are measured directly at the model self propulsion point thus the propeller characteristics and hull propeller interaction coefficients in waves are implicitly considered although for a slightly more loaded propeller namely at the model self propulsion point however calm water power is corrected for scale effects similarly in the second torque and rate of rotation method transfer functions of the change in torque and propeller rotation speed are defined from model tests in regular waves at model self propulsion point in the third thrust method transfer functions of thrust increase are defined from model tests in regular waves at the model self propulsion point thus this method requires propeller characteristics to define added power in waves which are taken as the open water propeller characteristics in calm water note that none of these three methods is suitable for the problem considered here since added resistance due to wind and rudder operation cannot be taken into account the thrust identity method is also mentioned in ittc 2002 as one of methods under discussion in this method added resistance due to waves is calculated from the transfer functions measured in regular waves thus wind resistance and other resistance components can be simply added however definition of the required power in this method requires propeller characteristics and hull propeller interaction coefficients which are defined in calm water note that accurate definition of propeller characteristics and hull propeller interaction coefficients in seaway for design and regulatory approval concerning manoeuvrability in adverse conditions is presently not critical since with the presently available knowledge ship designers will not try to optimise these characteristics to fulfil the minimum power regulations therefore some simplifications are possible until more knowledge is available therefore in the joint proposal imo 2017a thrust identity method is used to define the added power in adverse conditions and the open water propeller characteristics and hull propeller interaction coefficients are recommended to be defined by the methods approved for eedi verification i e presently from calm water propulsion and resistance tests so that no additional work is needed since eedi verification is required anyway in imo 2013 also empirical formulae are proposed for the thrust deduction fraction and wake fraction based on calm water values in the examples of assessments presented in this paper calm water values were used 6 discussion the proposed flexible approach to the assessment of ship s manoeuvrability under adverse conditions allows choosing between various procedures ranging from advanced assessment which is required for cases with large uncertainties to simple procedures sufficient for most conventional vessels three levels of complexity are considered the most accurate level 3 comprehensive assessment allows the best accuracy even in this procedure the designer does not have to use expensive evaluation methods to define the input elements and can choose between experimental numerical or empirical methods a less complex level 2 simplified assessment still considers the physics of the problem but applies a reduced number of assessment situations reduced complexity equations and significantly less input elements than the comprehensive assessment the simplest assessment level 1 relies on empirical formulae to define the required installed power as a function of main ship parameters level 1 assessment as a pure empirical procedure is applicable only to the vessels similar to those for which it was developed still it shows significant scatter even for such vessels note however that alternative ideas e g using bollard pull instead of installed power as in imo 2016b may lead to better results the simplified assessment is a compromise between simplicity flexibility and accuracy the analysis is simple and may use simple methods to define input elements while remaining open for high accuracy input elements if necessary however due to the simplifications involved this procedure is conservative the comprehensive assessment allows the best accuracy but requires extensive input three components surge and sway forces and yaw moment of calm water forces for drift angles from zero up to about 20 wind forces for 0 180 apparent wind directions and wave induced forces for 0 180 wave directions at all relevant wave frequencies as well as rudder forces and propeller characteristics the proposed comprehensive and simplified assessment procedures allow defining any of the input elements separately and with different methods experimental numerical or empirical depending on the needs and possibilities of designers and administrations experimental methods are established and available in sufficiently many facilities world wide for the evaluation of calm water wind rudder and propeller forces whereas measurement of the time average wave induced forces and moments needs advanced measurements in a seakeeping basin and therefore cannot be used routinely numerical methods are available in principle for calm water wind rudder and propeller forces again their availability for the time average wave induced forces is one of the most critical issues see shigunov et al 2018 the availability of empirical methods is especially important for practical design and approval the studies by shopera and the jasnaoe coordinated project concluded that such methods are in principle available for practical use for calm water reactions wind forces and rudder forces empirical methods for the time average wave induced forces and moments again require attention thus the availability of numerical and empirical methods for wave induced forces is critical for the practical implementation of the proposed assessment framework an important question is the overall uncertainty of the resulting procedures and practical ways to deal with this uncertainty level 1 shows high uncertainty which can be compensated only by its additional conservativeness for both the comprehensive and simplified assessment procedures the greatest uncertainty stems from the difference between the real operation strongly depending on human decisions such as ordering a tug waiting at anchor leaving dangerous area or searching for a shelter and design assessment criteria propulsion steering and weather vaning criteria considered here the second greatest source of uncertainty is introduced by the step from the assessment criteria to the practical assessment procedure i e here the omission of the time dependent wave induced forces and reducing the assessment to time average characteristics which simplifies not only the hydrodynamic forces but also transient reactions of the engine and propeller in waves this simplification although widely used has not been validated conclusively so far note validation of the comprehensive assessment in comparison with model tests and for an accident example in shigunov 2018 one more error is introduced in the simplified assessment due to the reduced number of assessment cases and simplified equations compared to the comprehensive assessment since the development of the simplified assessment was the aim of this paper it was validated here in comparison with the comprehensive assessment figs 5 6 9 and 10 show that this error is rather moderate and conservative the final source of uncertainties are the methods that are used to define the input elements for the comprehensive and simplified assessment procedures since the accuracy of the input can and must be verified in the regulatory approval this uncertainty is controllable this concerns also the dedicated simple empirical formulae that were developed here specifically for the simplified assessment the included validation examples show that their accuracy is sufficient the uncertainty introduced by the time averaging assumption can be quantified by comparison of the results of comprehensive assessment with transient model tests or numerical simulations note however that this is difficult to do in irregular short crested waves combined with wind and taking into account the need for accurate statistical estimates on the other hand verification of the gap between the real operation and practical criteria is not possible in a strict sense nevertheless a pragmatic solution to address this gap which also addresses the uncertainty due to time averaging is possible as long as the criteria and assessment procedures concern relevant ship characteristics for manoeuvrability in adverse conditions i e parameters of the steering and propulsion systems and treat them in a correct way these uncertainties can be compensated by fine tuning the standards here the wave height and wind force up to which the ship should satisfy the proposed criteria to be considered as safe this fine tuning can be done by applying the assessment procedures to a sufficiently big number of existing vessels taking into account accident statistics and individual accidents see imo 2016a and shigunov 2018 the standards should be adjusted in such a way that the resulting assessment appropriately differentiates safe and unsafe ships 7 conclusions the introduction of eedi raised the need to norm standardise ship s manoeuvrability under adverse conditions which requires definition of assessment criteria and corresponding measures and standards the research projects conducted by iacs eu shopera and jasnaoe proposed steering ability and propulsion ability criteria as minimum requirements for manoeuvrability of ships in adverse conditions related to the installed power this paper addresses evaluation of these criteria in practical design and regulatory approval keeping in mind that the problem of manoeuvrability in adverse weather conditions is very difficult and presently dealt with only in few advanced research centres worldwide a flexible assessment framework is proposed which includes three alternative levels of complexity the most accurate comprehensive assessment level 3 allows the best accuracy but requires a big number of input elements a less complex simplified assessment level 2 involves a reduced number of assessment situations reduced complexity equations and significantly less input elements the simplest assessment level 1 relies on empirical formulae to define the required installed power directly as a function of main ship parameters another factor contributing to the flexibility of the proposed assessment framework is that any input element required in the comprehensive and simplified assessment procedures can be defined separately and with different methods either experimental numerical or empirical depending on the needs and possibilities of designers and administrations experimental numerical and empirical methods are in principle established and available for all input elements apart from the time average wave induced forces and moments their experimental definition requires expensive measurements in a seakeeping basin whereas numerical and empirical methods for them are only developing especially useful for practical design and approval is the availability of simple empirical formulae dedicated specifically for the simplified assessment several such formulae are developed and validated in this paper for wave and wind induced forces and rudder forces the uncertainty of the resulting procedures and practical ways to deal with this uncertainty are discussed the uncertainty of the empirical level 1 assessment can be compensated only by its excessive conservativeness for the comprehensive and simplified assessment procedures the uncertainty stems from simplifications in criteria assumptions used in the assessment procedure use of time average characteristics and in the simplified assessment also reduced number of assessment cases and simplified equations and the uncertainties of methods used to define input elements the latter uncertainty is controllable the uncertainty introduced by the simplified assessment is evaluated in this paper and the remaining uncertainties i e uncertainties due to simplifications in criteria and assessment procedure can be pragmatically addressed by fine tuning the standards the wave height and wind force up to which the ship should satisfy the proposed criteria to be considered safe in such a way that the resulting assessment appropriately differentiates safe and unsafe
